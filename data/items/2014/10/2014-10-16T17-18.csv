8466269,comment,8464532,8464532,0,0,CharlesGust,,,"Bill Gates gives sound reasons for maintaining the estate tax, and I agree with the general proposition of having something like a consumption tax. But, I have a different take on the social utility of capital transfers.<p>Yes, what you invest in you tend to get more of. But, each capital transfer does not destroy the capital. So, if you are buying a yacht, that capital goes to the designer, the builders, the welders, the suppliers, etc. Now, the point is that these people now have their own choices to do something with the capital received. Some of it will go for food, some of it will go for BBQ grills, some of it will go for big screen TV&#x27;s. And, then the people receiving that capital will make their choices ad infinitum.<p>(Perhaps a performance artist alighting a million dollars in cash would actually destroy capital. They are undoubtedly more examples of waste)<p>I guess I can still see the incentives that would be built into a tax system (as they are built into ANY tax system) to alleviate what may otherwise be burdens on government into encouraging more social utility. But, I just wanted to emphasize that it is not that luxury spending has NO social utility, it just diffuses the social utility into multiple second order spending decisions.",1413482196
8466268,comment,8464532,8464532,0,0,squozzer,,,"I think what people miss about consumption taxes - beyond its&#x27; regressive nature - is that everything in the end is a form of consumption.
The distinction between capital, labor, and consumption is false - it only has meaning once you account for expected outcome.<p>Capital = purchases expected to generate a profit.
Labor = purchases expected to generate work. It need not generate a profit necessarily - e.g. paying someone to mow your lawn.
Consumption = purchases expected to generate pleasure, or avoid pain.<p>I&#x27;m sure the basis of these distinctions rest on some idea of social utility - that trying to turn a profit has more social utility than eating a Twinkie. Maybe we should examine that assumption also.<p>And consider how these notions entangle themselves in practice. A company car intended for non-personal use is considered an asset to the company, and treated as capital. But a similar car used for commuting is considered a consumption item.",1413482177

8466259,comment,8464532,8464532,0,0,lsiebert,,,"Okay, I want to talk a little bit about how wealthy people would benefit in a more egalitarian society.  But if we assume they are objectivist, there are some issues.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to do so, because it&#x27;s hard to say what can benefit a person who is wealthy already.<p>I mean I can point to data that suggests that people who earn better wages, get headstart, have libraries in their community, get a college education, etc are less likely to commit crimes, but your wealth probably means that you can afford good security.<p>I can say that in a more egalitarian society, vaccinations would be free, and thus you are your children are less likely to get diseases, but you have good health care, and so this isn&#x27;t a huge issue.<p>So I guess the best way is to point out that in a more egalitarian society with free or low cost education and funding for research, general progress in the sciences would happen faster.  You get better medicine, better technology, can potentially live longer.  Also such an economy will grow more quickly, and while if there were more stringent taxes you may not gain as much of the pie as you could, a bigger pie would cancel that out.",1413482121

8466250,comment,8462646,8462646,0,0,morganf,,,"So here&#x27;s what &quot;they&quot; don&#x27;t tell you: building a successful startup -- even by moderate definitions of &quot;successful,&quot; such as, &quot;reaching a point that lets you only work 4 hours/week&quot; -- is what economists call a &quot;superstar economy.&quot; Kinda like being a musician or a basketball player: 99.99% of the starving artists or guys in the neighborhood playing hoops make $0.00 from it, but one-in-a-million make a killing. There&#x27;s a small &quot;middle class&quot; in the ecosystem (people who don&#x27;t strike the goldmind but do just fine) but, for all practical purposes, it&#x27;s really, really tiny, too.<p>So, therefore: building your own app and putting it into the app store is helluva lot like trying to make your garage band a big hit. You must remember these three things to start your own band (or your own startup):<p>1.) Expect your band will never make a dollar. (Similarly, expect the startup to never make a dollar.)<p>2.) You must love creating music and feel such a deep calling to create that music, that you will obsessively create that music with the band, even remember #1, that your band will never make a dollar. (Yup, you must be so obsessed with your company&#x27;s mission and vision that you&#x27;ll do it even expecting it to fail.)<p>3.) You must be emotionally ready to play the lottery. If you&#x27;re not emotionally ready for the lottery, stay home.<p>4.) Similarly, you must instinctively feel like you are blessed by Fortuna, because luck needs to be on your side not just tonight but for the whole journey.<p>5.) It&#x27;s a f---load of hardwork to get people to notice what you do, and to get them excited about it. Are you prepared for that overwhelming, intense, nonstop amount of hardwork?<p>6.) You know what&#x27;s even harder about the hard work? There&#x27;s no one to tell you what to do. You don&#x27;t even know if what you&#x27;re doing is the right thing or not. There is a way to change what you&#x27;re doing and create something that will get people peeing in their pants with excitement. But you need to figure it out. No one will tell you, ever. In other words, more painful then 24 hours/day of work is 24 hours/day of work and not even knowing if you&#x27;re doing the right work....<p>7.) Unless you happen to have a very strong mentor or model, it makes the incredible amount of hard work still even harder. Jimmy Page was the highest paid studio musician in England before he went to start his own band. He had a series of great mentors to teach him the path. A good mentor will teach you what to listen to and what to ignore. You probably want to ignore this rambling post here.<p>Okay, 3 minute break over, back to work.... :)<p>morgan",1413482025

We don&#x27;t have enough solid talent because there simply isn&#x27;t a high enough saturation of learning opportunities. not even on the most basic levels. Higher ed CS degrees don&#x27;t train you up to work in the million and one startups that are looking for engineers of all levels.<p>You might argue that in the tech scene (those of us in locations where it exists and is prominent + we pay attention to the news because we&#x27;re in it) its VERY saturated. But your examples of other industries are those that have been standardized by higher ed. Apart from MBA&#x27;s and (for the most part agency-focused which don&#x27;t teach you much about modern digital tactics) marketing degrees, the start up industry, even to some extent the tech industry, lacks the educational infrastructure that fields like the sciences do.<p>If it was on that level, businesses like the bootcamps wouldn&#x27;t exist. Is it a problem that should be fixed? Yes, but bootcamps are the current solution. Some of them ::cough::careerfoundry::cough:: are rapidly working to help with the efforts of bringing things like teaching code to schools. Yes its a good business play, but it builds awareness around the problem at its core rather than creating a business to capitalize on it... which is what we do now.... obviously.",1413481877

First of all, the talk is always about a <i>progressive</i> wealth tax in the first place.

[1] More likely, this would create incentives for donations.<p>As a final thought, the idea of using a VAT to finance a basic income is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t help against wealth inequality, because poor people generally spend a much higher fraction of their disposable income on stuff on which VAT is paid.<p>[0] My intuition for this comes from income taxes: During the time when highest marginal rates were much higher than today, executives didn&#x27;t bother bargaining for the ridiculously high salaries that they get today, and so few people really paid those highest rates.<p>[1] And if you&#x27;re worried about people renouncing citizenship: I think we should grow a pair and get serious about exit taxes.",1413481128

The issue is that you haven&#x27;t solved the problems, and are instead suggesting you should get a pass because the problems are hard.  It seems simple to me: if you haven&#x27;t designed something that gives you truly unlinkable anonymity, don&#x27;t claim to provide it.

For instance, it would be better for people to agree and stop polluting the environment, or making crappy food (I don&#x27;t mean fast-food, I mean borderline-unsafe food made as cheaply as possible), or switching away from fossil fuels. But we can&#x27;t do that, because anyone who tries will get quickly outcompeted in the market by anyone who defects and keep doing the wrong thing. Therefore, we&#x27;re stuck in local optima instead of moving to better global ones.<p>There is an excellent piece by Yvain that goes into deep details of those problems[0], so I won&#x27;t be repeating him here much, but the world is full of such problems, and apparent stupidity of institutions and markets are usually result of inability to coordinate.<p>I&#x27;m not saying to give up democracy. But we have to appreciate that it has very troubling failure modes and that they&#x27;re not theoretical.<p>Real-life democracy tends to be extremely impotent. It has tremendous operating costs (think of all the resources wasted in a zero-sum game of political campaigning), and in the end people still can&#x27;t agree on things like building infrastructure (NIMBYsm) or creating laws that benefit the population. Again, I&#x27;m not saying &quot;ditch democracy&quot;. But there is a huge trade-off between security of decentralization and effectiveness of centralization.<p>There&#x27;s also the case that central planning doesn&#x27;t suck that much - it sucks when done for humans by humans, because central planners operate at human speed. But consider that instead of Paco setting up routes, there is a computer named PCO, tasked with collecting real-time data from all drivers and optimizing routes. PCO may alter some of instructions it sends to drivers to explore the solution space, and it will quickly figure out that doing only rights leads to less fuel used. And then it may stumble upon other optimizations, like shifting delivery times in different parts of the city depending on traffic patterns - things that are impossible to figure out by Pablo, because they require global view.<p>I think that central planning got a bad name because of Soviet implementation, but with modern computing, maybe we should re-evaluate its costs and benefits.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/</a>",1413480423

The average person isn&#x27;t as well equipped to deal with large problems as the elite are.</i><p>To really get to the truths behind this opinion, it is important to distinguish one&#x27;s political goals from the politically implemented policies in pursuit of those goals.<p>I fully agree with you that the average person is not well equipped to decide on policies. <i>However</i>, the vast majority of people in the elite aren&#x27;t equipped for that either! Look at somebody like Bill Gross, for example, who was removed from PIMCO after continuously making bad investments based on his misunderstanding of basic economic facts. I wouldn&#x27;t want somebody like that calling the shots in government.<p>Honestly, I would expect the connection between <i>wealth</i> and quality of policy analysis to be relatively weak. Education is certainly a confounding variable, but not all education is equal. (A good computer scientist doesn&#x27;t necessarily make a good economist.) In fact, in certain policy areas such as economics, being part of the elite - which usually means being a high-level executive - is probably a <i>negative</i> for the quality of your policy analysis, because executives see the world from a micro-economic perspective rather than from the macro perspective that is needed in politics.<p>In any case - I agree that a certain level of &quot;elitism&quot; is probably justified when it comes to the question of policy analysis, though you really have to be <i>very</i> careful who you think the &quot;elite&quot; is in that context.<p>However, if you leave politics up to an elite, then the <i>goals</i> of politics will also shift to match the goals of that elite, which is probably not a good representation of the goals of the overall population. And therein lies the real crux, because when it comes to deciding what the political goals should be, everybody really does have the same qualification. And this is ultimately the reason why democracy is the right way to go.<p>The tough problem is to establish institutions that translate democratically established goals into good policy.",1413480402

8466080,comment,8464532,8465603,0,0,vishnugupta,,,"> If you take that wealth and move it to the average person.<p>Wealth redistribution doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean taking money/wealth, literally, from wealthy and giving it away to poor. It includes, among others, subsidized education, free access to basic health care, nutritious food, potable water, eradication of epidemics, decent housing, decent retirement income and so on.<p>This is the problem I see in societies that are highly unequal (read US :-)) where in a democratically elected government is reduced to make way for capitalists. All or most of the above are controlled by multinational corporations whose sole motive is higher profits. So what ends up happening is that even a middle class family is just one calamity away (e.g., death of bread earner, a high cost health problem) from being pushed below poverty line. Even education for that matter has gotten privatized to an extent where only wealthy can afford good education; as various studies have shown education does make a significant difference when it comes to money earned over longer period. 
Or take 2008 recession where pension corpus of millions was reduced to zilch for no mistake of theirs.<p>Wealth distribution, at least in my mind, means that ensuring that most of the citizens are on level playing when it comes to basic necessities. Over and above that of course one must be rewarded as per their contribution to the society and hard work.<p>Poor are poor not just because they don&#x27;t have money but also because they are unable to get out of it. They have to go through unspeakable ordeal just to get one meal a day and this places enormous cognitive load on the entire family. So of course children of poor, more often than not, remain poor as their basic intelligence itself gets suppressed due to lack of nutritious food, cognitive load etc.,<p>The book, &quot;Poor Economics&quot;, was an eye opener for me in this regard. I once used to blame the poor for their situation but this book changed all of that. I would highly recommend it; to the extent that this should be made a mandatory reading in all colleges :-).<p>>  We want to make sure that the incentives of the people in power are aligned with the people who are not in power.<p>This is really a tough ask. Unless decision makers, i.e., those in power, are accountable, every single day, to those not in power, decision makers will soon align themselves with private, capitalist corporations. You have a multi billion dollar arms manufacturer, oil corporations funding millions to election campaigns of US presidents. And then you have US citizens who get to vote once in five years; we also know that the voting itself can be rigged, public opinion can be swayed and etc., Now, whom do you think would the president side with? Oil corporation or US citizens? The answer is obvious! And so you will end up having Iraq war which is yet another way to funnel massive amount of tax payer money to private corporations; the cruel irony is that most of foot soldiers who are fighting the war and dying come from poor, disadvantaged families.<p>Democracy as it&#x27;s played out in US (and India) today is a complete farce. The fact that executive powers and policy making is concentrated in so few a hands in itself is indicative that this isn&#x27;t democracy. Instead of giving power to the few and somehow hoping that their interests are aligned with rest of the citizens what needs to be done is build strong institutions.<p>Democracy is fundamentally about strong institutions (court of law; education system; health care system; labor friendly laws) which are run and maintained by common citizens. Elected representatives&#x27; main job is do minor tweaks to the policies. This way the executive power remains with the commoner.<p>What has been happening is a very systemic eradication of these democratic institutions; privatized education, private health care; private police force; private fire fighters and so on. Once you have hallowed the core of democracy by privatizing it you are left with just a handful of elected representatives who wield enormous power over rest of the citizens. They of course end up serving private corporations. US is run and controlled, more or less, by just a handful of private corporations which are in turn owned by a hundred individuals. Election, democracy etc., is just to keep the citizens believing that they have a say in the way the society is run when the reality is completely opposite. India, following the foot steps of US, is getting there really fast.",1413480073

Her iPad and iPhone are on the bedside table; when she wakes, she opens the blinds and returns to bed to catch up on FB, etc., for a while.<p>My phone is only ever in the bedroom if I need an alarm. Otherwise, it is downstairs, in my office, on silent from 10pm to 7:30am. (If there is a piece of tech at my bedside, it&#x27;s my tablet, on Airplane mode: It&#x27;s my e-reader.)<p>My first conscious moments downstairs involve needy pets and connecting my caffeine mainline. I turn to the news only after a while, at my laptop: I prefer the bigger screen and keyboard and trackpad for production and consumption, except for books and essays, which I read on the aforementioned tablet. My phones have always been second choices for consumption, and third for production, used only for what they excel at, mobile convenience.<p>Mobile. Hmm....<p>Perhaps we need two other, more distinct words. For some, like the article&#x27;s author, a mobile device is Ubiquity: Always present, always in hand, always in use, Primary. My wife is closer to that than I (though there are many tasks for which she also prefers her laptop; she will go from iPhone or iPad to Air, rarely from iPhone to/from iPad).<p>For others, for me, a mobile device is Necessity or Necessary Evil or Handy, Secondary: Used only when my Primary, my laptop, is unavailable. (And even then, sometimes my laptop comes with and my mobile becomes an access point.)<p>As to the real point of the story, I agree wholeheartedly. I struggle with this myself and continue to swing between the poles trying to find the happy medium of just enough Connection and Consumption to keep up and so much that I am overwhelmed and unproductive.<p>(Sometimes my wife scolds me for not checking FB frequently enough: FB is the first thing to go when HN, /., etc., take too much of my time.)",1413479626

The preceding discussion is not intended to convey an overly simplistic view of genetics or systems biology. Complex nonlinear genetic systems certainly exist and are realized in every organism. However, quantitative differences between individuals within a species may be largely due to independent linear effects of specific genetic variants. As noted, linear effects are the most readily evolvable in response to selection, whereas nonlinear gadgets are more likely to be fragile to small changes. (Evolutionary adaptations requiring significant changes to nonlinear gadgets are improbable and therefore require exponentially more time than simple adjustment of frequencies of alleles of linear effect.) One might say that to first approximation, Biology = linear combinations of nonlinear gadgets, and most of the variation between individuals is in the (linear) way gadgets are combined, rather than in the realization of different gadgets in different individuals.<p>Linear models works well in practice, allowing, for example, SNP-based prediction of quantitative traits (milk yield, fat and protein content, productive life, etc.) in dairy cattle. ...",1413479068

Some of their issues are transnational (like when they put pressure on companies), and they criticize governments worldwide. But when they directly lobby politicians it&#x27;s typically only the American ones. It can get legally tricky to do otherwise, because many countries have laws restricting foreign organizations from becoming directly involved in elections/campaigning.<p>In some European countries, one of the members of EDRi might be worth looking into (some are more politically active than others): <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Digital_Rights#Members"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Digital_Rights#Member...</a>",1413478916

Contacting someone is neither &quot;removing&quot; nor &quot;disabling access&quot;.<p>The law is simply not ambiguous here, and github trying to play this game is not likely to go well in an actual court, as much as i&#x27;d like it to be the case (i know other companies have been threatened on <i>exactly</i> this point before).",1413478905

The superconductive magnet coils are exposed to the neutron flux that transfers fusion reaction energy to the absorptive thermal blanket. I don&#x27;t know offhand the neutron cross-sections of likely superconductor materials at whatever neutron energy spectrum this reactor will produce, but I suspect energy absorption by the magnet structure won&#x27;t be small. I wonder how they plan to keep the magnets cold. Never mind the other effects on materials of high-flux neutron absorption.",1413478816

It isn't actually illegal to have such a clause in the contract, but if it were to come to court it would be thrown out as an unreasonable clause.<p>The problem from the employee's point of view though is that it may have to come to court before the employer will back down and there are costs in terms of money, time, and relationships associated with that especially if the company goes for the appeal cycle afterwards. Most individuals can't afford the time or cost of such a case (though costs are likely to be recovered from the company eventually, you need to find the funds up front) if it comes to that, and the software industry can be fairly judgemental and nepotistic so it'll be hard work getting a new job (once life becomes unpleasant at the old one due to the court case) now you have a reputation for being difficult. These considerations are why individuals back down quickly, as the assume the conversation will go:<p><pre><code>    Company:    We own that.\n    Individual: No you don't.\n    Company:    Contract says so.\n    Individual: You can't enforce that.\n    Company:    We can try. Wanna fight?\n    Individual: Er, no. Here, take it.\n</code></pre>\nCompanies <i>know</i> the clause is not legally enforceable, but they have it in there because they know it generally doesn't have to be as most people will not argue as far as the legal status of the clause being relevant (in fact most people don't even <i>know</i> that it isn't legally enforceable). This is particularly the case for younger people or those otherwise near the start of their career.<p>Most non-compete clauses are in a similar legal position.",1363692240
5400179,comment,5394494,5394494,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"A good point, but I think it's brought across a little clumsily.<p>What is the point of all software?<p>Well, in a computer science sense it is to ""solve problems"", but that doesn't help us, it's too abstract. So what is the point of all software used by humans? Ah, this is getting a bit closer to the matter. It is to bridge the gap between the user and ""solving problems"" in a computer science sense. Put a different way, the point of software is to render the machinery of computation human usable.<p>We can imagine doing this at a simplistic level by just exposing the guts and internals of whatever ""problem solving"" program we are concerned with and allowing the user to fiddle with them directly. This is the checkboxes problem. It's a control panel with a bunch of levers or toggle switches. This is certainly <i>an</i> interface but it is typically not a very good one. It's the Altair 8800 of interfaces, it's really only a few steps removed from toggling in boot code directly and mucking about with machine code, calling such a thing an interface at all is generous.<p>But consider not only the problems brought up in the article, that of levers accessible to the user which the vast majority of time you don't want to change. This reminds me of a utility program in one of the Windows NT tool kits, fragment.exe. Which does exactly what you think it does to a hard drive, obviously for testing purposes. It's not something any sane person would ever use normally, but imagine if there were a common command-line tool that had been designed to both fragment or defragment a drive, call it fragtool.exe perhaps, and it would take either --increase or --decrease options. That sort of interface skews your perception of things and it can quite easily lead people into believing that fragmenting a hard drive is not as exceptional an activity as others understand it to be.<p>As this example should illustrate, this is a problem that many command-line tools suffer from (I'm looking at you, git).<p>The goal of good software creators should be to translate their domain experience not just into a problem solving toolkit, it should also be to guide the user towards patterns of use that make sense, are more common, or are more beneficial.<p>Getting back to the example of poor lever-based interfaces. Imagine something not just with unnecessarily exposed likely to be detrimental ""advanced options"" but merely something with several options that interact with each other. This can easily create a fundamentally intractable problem for a user. Remember that toggles are like bits, so if you have, say, 4 toggles that means you have 16 different combinations, and if you have 10 toggles you have over a <i>thousand</i> combinations. Again, here is where the value of good software design comes in. As a coder you should be translating your knowledge of the problem space and the underlying capabilities of the software into configuration options that make more sense to the user. For example, if you have 10 toggles are there actually a thousand different equally useful configurations or are there options that tend to fall into certain patterns relative to each other or maybe there are only a small number of specific configurations which tend to be popular. So consider using an interface that abstracts the options behind a different set of higher level configurations that make sense to the user.<p>I forget who invented the term, but a great concept is the ""pit of success"". It's generally the idea that in a good design the easiest and most natural way to do something will tend to be the most beneficial. Software that guides you towards using it in the most effective way, rather than software which requires a steep learning curve just to avoid using it incorrectly, let alone to its maximum potential.",1363692211

Certainly in her other story about inappropriate behaviour, she acts very reasonably. However, we can't really tell from how she writes the story whether the guy she complained about was just joking around with his friend, or directing sexual comments towards her in a harassing manner.<p>The problem with sexual harassment isn't that it attacks expectations of chastity, and to be honest, that's quite a condescending attitude to take. Sexual harassment is unpleasant because it makes people feel uncomfortable and frightened. If you think jokes can't be frightening then that is a failure on your part.<p>Sexual harassment isn't uncomfortable and scary because unwanted sexual attention offends one's virtue. Overt sexual advances are unprofessional, they put people in awkward social positions, and embarrass them in front of their peers. Unwanted sexual attention in a professional environment can be very disrespectful - it's an unwelcome diversion away from the desired professional interactions, and sends a clear message that you're not being taken seriously at all. It's potentially career damaging stuff, so it makes sense that it makes people uncomfortable.<p>Sexual harassment becomes deeply uncomfortable when it persists. When someone receives a sexual comment and responds coldly or uncomfortably, with obvious embarrassment  or disinterest, they expect the sexual content to stop. If the sexual comments persist, that is creepy. It's not necessarily that the comments themselves are deeply offensive, it's the fact that someone is persisting in an action that is intrusive and unpleasant to you. In a professional environment, it is expected that everyone behave politely and with consideration. If someone presses the point and tries to engage with you in a sexual manner beyond the bounds of normal politeness, then you begin to think they are motivated by some strong feelings, and that is scary. Worse still, once you become scared, if they persist further, that means they don't even care about frightening you.<p>It is genuinely quite scary when someone has some strong feelings towards you that drive them to ignore social convention and your discomfort and fear. Worse still, complaints about sexual harassment often get dismissed as simple misunderstandings and not taken seriously. The fact is, misunderstandings are scary if someone is misunderstanding your fear and discomfort as an invitation to bed.",1363691526

Oddly enough, I know a few groups who basically race in the traffic; However, the ones I know, reside in Netherlands. Most of the time, when I see conflicts between cyclists and cyclists or pedestrians it is due to bad design (of the pathways of each of one).\nIn Germany often simply a few red stones in the sideway are defined as cycling path. Recently, cyclist traffic gets detached from the sideway and placed on the road. What is good and basically copied over from Netherlands and Belgium. A downer at this point is, that the state doesn&#x27;t change the width of already existing roads, though it would be possible sometimes. Thus cars constantly are driving on this &quot;cycling lane&quot; or simply forget it is there.<p>Basically, I&#x27;m speaking of (road)cycling and cyclo-cross. Not necessarily competitive. Considering commuting it gets better, as nature and sustainability is more in political focus these days. However, it is _really_ far away from the infrastructure you see in Netherlands and Belgium.<p>But it is also depending upon what you compare here. So, considering a global view, I guess that Germany is way over the top. Considering good design, Netherlands and Belgium have my wholehearted appreciation. Netherlands even much more than Belgium.<p>On a side-note: I do not believe Strava neither has much commuter nor too much &quot;leisure&quot; data, imho, most of them are somewhat ambitious.",1399125338

Capitalism exists because different people have conflicting desires and unequal abilities. Capitalism is just another word for natural selection. Any attempts to get rid of capitalism as the &quot;default&quot; state of interhuman relations, will have to be accompanied by massive amounts of force, because you cant fight human nature without force. And even then, the only people willing to invest force and suffering to end the natural state of things are people who would personally profit from ending it, otherwise they would have no motivation to lift a finger, let alone lose one fighting to end capitalism, which then makes the attempt to violently end capitalism just another, more brutish form of natural selection.<p>You can not somehow &quot;out-smart&quot; natural selection and evolution and make people live happily together ever after without anybody exploiting anybody else.

[1] [2]<p>A few years ago, my wife worked on an ethnographic research project about the lack of swimming skills in the African-American population. One thing that was striking was the difference with other multi-cultural countries --e.g. the UK and South Africa-- where there are no such differences in the acquisition of swimming skills between ethnic groups. In the UK, learning to swim is part of the national curriculum, unlike the US [edit: I don&#x27;t mean this to be an exclusive explanation].<p>On a personal note, the notion that so many US children don&#x27;t know how to swim is horrifying. I consider it a basic life skill, as important as knowing how to cross a road.

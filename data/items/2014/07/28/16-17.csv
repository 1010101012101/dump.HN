Note there&#x27;s also no possibility for him to mend his ways and be re-instated.<p>Imagine if the same applied to people who run physical businesses - some shop owner skips some paperwork thinking it&#x27;ll be harmless, gets caught, gets a fine... and then is banned from ever owning a shop ever again for the rest of his life, no appeal.<p>This is our brave new cloud-oriented future - where all the power to regulate what content is available to millions of users lies in the hands of a couple of private companies.

There&#x27;s nothing about how feeds are presented, or how individual items in a feed are presented. Instead we get &quot;full screen reading&quot;, &quot;swipe anywhere to go back&quot;, &quot;multiple themes&quot;, &quot;rich sharing via OvershareKit&quot; (whatever that is), and a testimonial from someone I&#x27;ve never heard of, who turns out to be the author himself. Oh, and the screenshots themselves are shrunk down to make room for the text annotation at the top. Nothing here makes me feel like I know what I&#x27;ll be getting for my $4.99:<p><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/unread-an-rss-reader/id754143884?ls=1&mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/unread-an-rss-reader/id75414...</a><p>In contrast, my iPhone RSS reader of choice, Reeder 2, has screenshots that show exactly what you&#x27;ll see on various screens in the app. It&#x27;s much less of a risk to buy upfront when you know what you&#x27;ll be getting:<p><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder-2/id697846300?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder-2/id697846300?mt=8</a><p>Of course, it&#x27;s easy to armchair criticize, but as someone who is in the target market for an app like this (I&#x27;ve bought and use several well-designed iPhone RSS apps), I thought I&#x27;d explain why Unread never managed to convince me it was worth buying.",1406566726

8097960,comment,8096483,8097647,5,0,kbenson,,,"That&#x27;s just it, the reason I noticed it was because they didn&#x27;t continue at that speed.  They pass, then they slow down to slower than my original speed (I&#x27;m also careful not to speed up at all if someone is passing me, that&#x27;s stupid and reckless).  I had thought about it being my own perception, but the fact is that I didn&#x27;t first assume it was because I was driving a minivan.  For the first few months I was just sort of annoyed that people seemed to be driving stupid, but mostly when I drove the minivan. Then when thinking about it it occurred to me that it was likely the minivan and perceptions that surround it that cause the problem.<p>My working theory is that people have bad experiences being stuck behind a slow minivan (which I&#x27;ll admit, happens), and those experiences can be particularly annoying because it&#x27;s hard to see past minivans.  As people find themselves behind a minivan in a situation where their speed isn&#x27;t quite yet stabilized (such as shortly after entering the freeway), they either assume it&#x27;s going slow or just decide they want to not be behind a minivan, so pass.<p>I have had corroboration from other minivan owners I know, but I am open to being wrong or misinterpreting the information. I suspect it&#x27;s less to do with that and more to do with specific traffic patterns that make it more or less likely (such as light traffic allowing easy passing), which may be more or less prevalent in certain areas.",1406566666

But every once in a while, there&#x27;s just NOTHING good being posted. So it&#x27;s good to have a fallback to a radio station of some kind, one that I can just open the app, hit the &quot;big triangle&quot;, and just get music immediately. That instant gratification is the real value of the app. I have Rinse.FM&#x27;s app for this purpose.<p>Incidentally, I feel like as smartphones become more ubiquitous and embedded into the rest of our lives, we&#x27;ll start to see apps that have a much more simple purpose. After all, since Siri isn&#x27;t programmable by app developers, the fastest way to listen to NPR is now downloading the app, holding your home button, and saying &quot;Open NPR One&quot;. Perhaps the app could be designed so that it immediately begins streaming when you open it, that way you can just tell your phone something and suddenly you&#x27;re listening to the radio.<p>All of this audio streaming <i>is</i> on a consistent platform, it&#x27;s mostly Icecast or SHOUTcast servers doing the actual streaming. Theoretically, one could build a directory of radio stations like Nullsoft did with SHOUTcast, but the main issue is the platform has never been created by a company whose SOLE PURPOSE is to index and catalog current radio stations. Until we get that, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re gonna see a platform improvement any time soon.",1406566638

Fair Use under the USC is an exception allowing, primarily personal [but by no means exclusively], use of otherwise copyright material. Eg fair-use covers limited educational exceptions, incidental infringements (you take a photo and it happens to have a copyright protected work in that isn&#x27;t the feature of the image), etc., etc..<p>Fair Use is a legal defence against a claim that you have tortuously infringed someone&#x27;s copyright. The reason it works is because under Fair Use exceptions there is no tort committed, that is why you get off. It&#x27;s _not_ the court saying &quot;well you committed a tort against them but it was only a small one&quot; it&#x27;s the court saying that under the USC there has been no tort committed.<p>If someone died whilst you were defending yourself, you don&#x27;t &quot;get off&quot; it&#x27;s ajudged to be (and considered in the relevant code or statute) acceptable, you didn&#x27;t murder them.

However, I think he had an important point that needs to be discussed: that he was dismissed without a fair hearing and was banned for life from services unrelated to the one on which he committed the offense.<p>I think this is a growing problem that more people need to be aware of. We do not have the <i>right</i> to use modern marketplaces (such as the Google Play Store, Apple App Store, Google Adwords, AirBnB, Ebay, Uber, etc.) Instead, we have <i>permission</i> from corporations to use them. If an individual bases his livelihood on sales through one of these and then makes a mistake, the company is likely to ban him, destroying his income. There is currently no guarantee of due process or proportional punishment. When you are banned from the majority marketplace, one often has no real alternative.

Now, if a new CEO candidate had taken actions similar to Brendan&#x27;s, that would reasonably affect their views and the board&#x27;s (and Mozilla&#x27;s staff, community, users, partners, etc.) about whether it would best serve the project for the board to name them CEO.

The bulk of the money the agents make will come from the part of the house that could sell very easily. If a house could sell for $200,000 today, but you have to have it listed six months before it could sell for $220,000 (which is unknown at the time, of course). The seller agent is going to make $6,000 of the $200k sale (3%) but will only make $600 more from selling it for an extra $20,000. And a lot of the time that 3% number is high. If they aren&#x27;t a broker, they&#x27;re splitting that 3% with someone else, so maybe the extra $20k sale price only nets them an extra $300 in their pocket.<p>When I was selling my house a few years ago, I talked with one agent that was recommended to me and he was so blatantly obvious in his desire to get commissions that I couldn&#x27;t believe the people who recommended him failed to see that. He came in, refused to list the house for less than a 6% split (this is negotiable, 5% isn&#x27;t uncommon at all) and wanted to LIST the house for around $8,000 less than what I actually sold it for a few months later. It wasn&#x27;t that big of a house and was in an area with very affordable housing, so that extra $8,000 was high enough of a total % to make a huge difference.<p>Also, I&#x27;d venture that many people selling their houses still have a mortgage on the house, so the huge base commission the seller agent makes isn&#x27;t even coming off of the owner&#x27;s profit, it&#x27;s coming of the amount they need to pay back the note.",1406565932

One home was sold already before it was taken down. I did find out that Houston has a really nice site, har.com that lets you do basically everything Trulia & Zillow does. Realtors have other interface(s) into the same data, which lets them do different things like N sided polygons instead of just squares for map searches.<p>Tours vs images is definitely an issue. Some people are just bad photographers, some only have 6 images (Houston MLS requires 6 images for a posting). Some are good photographers, that make things look bigger than in person.<p>Experience is hugely variable though. I called 2 agent offices, and got stuck with their most inexperienced Buyer&#x27;s Agent. The more experienced people are doing sales of homes or commercial, and getting a cut of the commissions of the people under them. Some Googling led me to roughly a 60/40 split between agent & office, along with the agent paying a desk fee (~$50/monthly). Since the principal is still getting paid, you can involve them if needed for second opinions or more nuanced explanations. Agents are getting roughly 3% of the sales price.<p>Still read all your documents. I&#x27;ve caught things that slipped past my realtor, and also brought up questions for her to answer.<p>Inspections are a mixed bag. They have a preferred list, and should also provide you a legal document stating their incentives for any recommended providers (including home warranty companies). I ended up going with one of my realtor&#x27;s preferred inspectors, but only after calling all 5 on their list, and several more listed on Yelp.<p>Knowledge goes back to experience.

It was so bad I considered buying the Realtor&#x27;s Residential Construction Certification program (1 day course, ~$300, they&#x27;ll sell to anyone) and going through it myself if I went with new construction.<p>Another point about knowledge is that even with experience, you can come up with stuff they don&#x27;t know.

8097765,comment,8095574,8096536,20,0,sigil,,,"<i>Granted, the object-orientation [in Perl] felt more like a hack than a normal language feature (because it was one)... </i><p>Perl&#x27;s OOP is definitely a hack! But it&#x27;s a clever and elegant hack, and younger languages can learn a lot from studying how an awk++ managed to evolve support for all these new programming paradigms, without being totally co-opted by the ones which turned out to be fads. (When these languages are Perl&#x27;s age, will they have evolved as successfully?)<p>Take OOP support in Perl. Prior to that, Perl had references, which could point to other basic value types, and it had packages, which were namespaces in the symbol table. Only two small changes were necessary for OOP.<p>First, a new built-in function `bless` was added which marked a reference as associated with a certain package. Second, a new binary operator for dispatch was added, the familiar `->` from other languages. The dispatch operator looked up a package from the reference on the left hand side, looked up a symbol within that package given by the right hand side, and pushed the reference onto the front of the argument list in the subsequent function call. In the called function, the initial reference argument became the equivalent of `this`, by convention.<p>Modulo some discussion of @ISA, that&#x27;s it. You now understand Perl&#x27;s implementation of OOP.<p>The elegance of this approach finally hit home for me when building transparent RPC for Perl and other languages. On the client side, when you dispatch a function call on a &quot;stub&quot; object, you&#x27;d like to dispatch a real function call on a remote object. In Python, you have to worry about whether you&#x27;re calling a &quot;bound function&quot; on the remote object, versus calling a static method of the remote object, versus calling a &quot;free function&quot; defined at module scope (how do you address these?), and so on. In Perl, these are all effectively the same thing because the dispatch operator is so simple, and there&#x27;s no extra OOP structure baked into the language itself like there is with Python.<p>Disclaimer: I mostly write Python 2.x now, but things like the complicated object runtime and the general uselessness of lambdas strike me as places where the language has stumbled.",1406565028

Isn&#x27;t the Freakonomics argument that an agent is incentivized to instead sell the property <i>as quickly as possible</i>, regardless of the sale price?

If the agent&#x27;s time is worth almost anything approaching a respectable hourly rate for a sales professional, then they should pressure the seller to take the lower offer, as not doing so would likely incur significant time costs (well over $150 worth of their time) for the listing agent.<p>Is that view of things mistaken?",1406564826

One of my favorite subs to go to, r/tabbletennis, has only about 2k subscribers, and I&#x27;m sure that there are more subs that certain people love, but have even less subscribers.<p>My point is that the logical point for payment would be through a mod, and I&#x27;m sure that outside of the larger subs, mods would be the ones footing the bill.

8097577,comment,8096491,8096912,19,0,zachanker,,,"I worked at Placester for a couple of years and built the system that imports data from real estate agencies. When I left last year, we had coverage with around 90% of the MLS&#x27;s in the US. Most of what you say is right, but some clarifications and context:<p>You don&#x27;t need to be a brokerage to get access to the MLS feed. Each MLS has their own policies for how you can display the data, what logos, size and text needs to be shown on the page with their listings though. Which means it unrealistic to build Zillow/Trulia site off of MLS data. Placester builds them for individual real estate agents which is significantly easier for keeping the MLS happy.<p>Some MLS&#x27;s are great and will give you access to the data without much hassle, others are not and you have to pay a lot of money. Even once you get access, you will get almost no technical help or useful documentation on integrating with them. Since MLS&#x27;s are almost never related, you still need to talk to 300+ different companies in order to get coverage of the US.<p>There is a standard that most MLS&#x27;s follow for their data, which is called RETS [1]. I would say about 80% of MLS&#x27;s use RETS, the problem with RETS is that it&#x27;s a standard in the same sense that CSS was a standard 10 years ago. The original library I wrote for RETS [2] is open sourced, and is littered with examples [3], [4] and [5] (to name a few), of inconsistencies across RETS servers.<p>If you can work through all of that, you&#x27;re golden. It took us about 1.5-2 years to get the experience of seeing how MLS&#x27;s work in order to simplify the integration process down to 1-2 days, with RETS typically requiring no (or minimal) engineering work.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Estate_Transaction_Standard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Estate_Transaction_Standar...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://github.com/zanker/ruby-rets"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/zanker/ruby-rets</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://github.com/zanker/ruby-rets/blob/master/lib/rets/http.rb#L148"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/zanker/ruby-rets/blob/master/lib/rets/htt...</a>\n[4] <a href=""https://github.com/zanker/ruby-rets/blob/master/lib/rets/http.rb#L217"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/zanker/ruby-rets/blob/master/lib/rets/htt...</a>\n[5] <a href=""https://github.com/zanker/ruby-rets/blob/master/lib/rets/http.rb#L254"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/zanker/ruby-rets/blob/master/lib/rets/htt...</a>",1406563551

They&#x27;re spherical because from the assembly line to shipping to the customer, they simply work better. They handle dents well, they roll along assembly lines fluidly, they keep the orientation of the product labels, they&#x27;re easy to inspect for quality, and they pack and unpack well. Obviously they also stay put on a shelf...<p>In terms of dimensions there&#x27;s several factors to consider: label size, stacking efficiency and directional integrity. If you want a nice big color photo of your product, a taller, slimmer container will allow for a large color background and plenty of text for both the front and rear labels. Depending on if it&#x27;s skinny or wide will determine how other products can be stacked around or on top/below it. And some foods (like tuna) keep their shape/consistency better when laid horizontally to prevent from breaking up while being transported. Similar foods hold together better when the pieces are larger, so larger portions of canned fish have the typical vertical orientation. And of course there&#x27;s only so much horizontal space that can be allocated per unit before the shelves burst at the seams.<p>For sealable cuboid containers, more and more containers are being modified with grippable edges to make it easier to handle, since the customer doesn&#x27;t use the entirety of the product at once (<a href=""http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81W3JCB8tHL._SL1500_.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81W3JCB8tHL._SL1500_.j...</a>).

8450284,comment,8447518,8450156,0,0,kjs3,,,"Yeah...I got lucky.  My third year or so at Georgia Tech a professor offered a &quot;special topics&quot; (e.g. not in the course catalog; his personal research interest) undergrad class in supercomputing.  GaTech was good for little bonuses like this (I took Micheal Barnsley&#x27;s first IFS class, too).<p>In addition to Crays, we got time on a CDC Cyber 180/990 and a 205, an ETA machine, and had cursory intro to NEC SX, BBN Butterfly, Multiflow Trace and a few other weird things noone has ever heard of. We wrote a handful of numerical methods programs for each (so, yes, computing mathematical constants and such, but more vector/array manipulations), and looked at how the architecture of the machines (short v. long vectors, register based v. memory based, vector v. MIMD v. VLIW) effected the speed of the programs and what optimizations/refactorings resulted in large speedups.<p>Good times.",1413230375

8450274,comment,8449680,8449680,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"&quot;Worse Is Better&quot; has evolved into a monster.<p>Originally, it looked like this:<p>* MIT philosophy: never compromise on correctness, even in bizarre corner cases. Aim for conceptual beauty <i>to a programmer</i>.<p>* New Jersey (Bell Labs) philosophy: comprise on correctness for simplicity or performance.<p>In 1985, six years before &quot;Worse Is Better&quot; was originally written, the &quot;New Jersey&quot; attitude was probably more useful. Most people, if they wanted to write acceptably performant software, had to do it in assembly. C was less of a leap, conceptually and in terms of average-case performance, than Lisp was. People who&#x27;d been writing assembly programs for years could learn how to write performant C. Writing <i>performant</i> Lisp would be much harder. A contemporary Common Lisp executable is at least 40 MB (obviously, that wasn&#x27;t the case in the 1980s); at that time, 1 MB was a powerful machine. &quot;Worse is better&quot; <i>worked</i> in the 1970s and &#x27;80s. If every piece of computing work had to be perfect before it could be shipped, we&#x27;d be far behind where we are.<p>Also, quite a number of the original Unix programs were for natural-language processing (at a level that&#x27;d be primitive today) and paper formatting. With the resources of the time, it would&#x27;ve been impossible to get much of that stuff perfectly right anyway.<p>Bell Labs wasn&#x27;t full of the anti-intellectual idiots who invoke worse-is-better, lean-startup tripe today. They knew what they were doing. They knew the compromises they were working under. They bet on Unix and C rather than Lisp machines, and they were right. In 2014, thanks to our ability to stand on the shoulders of giants that were built using C, we have machines that can efficiently run code in pretty much any language, so the C programmers <i>and</i> the Lispers have won. At least, on that front.<p>However, the &quot;worse is better&quot; lesson doesn&#x27;t apply nearly as well in 2014. We can do about 500,000 times as much computation per dollar as we could in 1991. That&#x27;s 500,000 times (at least!) as many opportunities for things to go wrong. A bug that happens once per 100 billion operations used to be negligible and now it&#x27;s often not.<p>Unfortunately, we have an industry beset by mediocrity, in which commodity developers are managed by commodity business executives to work on boring problems, and low software quality is simply tolerated as something we&#x27;ll always have to deal with. Instead of the knowing compromise of Bell Labs, &quot;worse is better&quot; has evolved into the slipshod fatalism of business people who just assume that software will be buggy, ugly, hard to use, and usually discarded after about 5 years. Yet we&#x27;re now in a time where, for most problems, we <i>can</i> affordably do them correctly and, because things happen so much faster now, we often put ourselves and our businesses at serious risk if we don&#x27;t.",1413230283

8450224,comment,8449680,8449680,0,0,jasode,,,"Discussing the meme &quot;worse is better&quot; is difficult because there are different interpretations and usages of that phrase.      It&#x27;s description vs prescription.  The blog author chose the prescription interpretation.  I can&#x27;t tell if the author unknowingly did this because he did not see a separate evolution of that meme.<p>First interpretation is the descriptive usage.  We could explicitly prefix the meme and qualify it as RGWIB (Richard-Gabriel-Worse-is-Better).  The original label was the observation that &quot;simpler&quot; software was more successful than more full-featured software with ambitious goals.  Richard&#x27;s thesis wasn&#x27;t about &quot;hacks&quot; but about small and simple things that satisfy users and builds momentum.<p>Second interpretation is the prescriptive (or self-justifying) stance which I might call HOBWIB (Hacks-Ok-Because-Worse-is-Better.)  This appears to be what the blogger is complaining about.<p>However, HOBWIB isn&#x27;t Richard Gabriel&#x27;s thesis.  That &quot;worse is better&quot; has taken on a life of its own and <i>repurposed</i> by others who are unaware of RG&#x27;s original meaning is just a circumstance of adopting snappy soundbites.  Whatever behavior the author is complaining about would exist whether the exact phrase &quot;worse is better&quot; existed or not.<p>>“Worse is Better”, in other words, asks us to accept a false dichotomy: either we write software that is ugly and full of hacks, or we are childish idealists who try to create software artifacts of beauty and elegance.<p>That label does not have that power over us.  For example, we have a label for certain human behavior and call it &quot;passive aggressive.&quot;  The existence of that phrase <i>did not force us to choose</i> whether to be passive aggressive or not.  Likewise, thinking that the existence of 3 words &quot;worse is better&quot; is forcing us into a dichotomy of bad vs good design is flawed analysis.",1413229720

Users must use real names on social media.<p>The Great Firewall and the blocking of media apps does also function as a Firewall. It is not merely a censorship technology. The United States and allies are known to target media in other countries to stir dissent. Radio Free Europe, &quot;Voice of Iraq&quot; (<i>cough</i> American), the Lincoln Group infiltrations and partnerships, etc.<p>The Snowden leaks and the history of (especially) Google but also other US businesses in China (and export exceptions limiting the purchase of infrastructure technologies) tell a tale of the US trying to export compromised services to China. China does not want its citizens&#x27; informations in America&#x27;s XKeyScore nor it&#x27;s citizens Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, etc data in America&#x27;s PRISM.

It sounds like you&#x27;re hinting at an easier method of last design, but printing a replica of a foot doesn&#x27;t give you a last -- it needs to be sculpted to fit the foot throughout the day, with appropriate adjustments for foot expansion, stretching, length, etc.<p>The last also has an enormous impact on the external appearance of the shoe. A custom dress last and a custom workboot last made for the same foot will differ signigicantly, and not in a way a computerized process could easily adjust for. (I&#x27;m sure it could be done, but it would take a concerted effort by someone with substantial resources and access to tons of feet to measure and study.)<p>The limiting factor isn&#x27;t in last production, but rather design. And that&#x27;s not something that 3d printing will help.",1413229186

8450171,comment,8449164,8449164,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"In my opinion this is fundamentally a problem of mixing coprocessing metaphors. The whole thread vs process vs container differences are tied up in leakage between the permissions model (process) and computation model (threads and containers). The thread equivalent of &#x27;fork&#x27; would be some form of promotion to a &#x27;root&#x27; thread (which is to say one where instance data about computation limits can be changed independently) Processes, which were the traditional collection point of resources under an identity, ideally sit apart from computation constraints. And if you follow that path you realize that resource allocation (which is one of the three key parts of OS management) then need to both be computation aware, and identity aware. In the example of the article, malloc would break the lock such that its validity would be related to the identity it was associated with, so if you promoted a thread to the &#x27;identity&#x27; level you would invalidate any locks visible to it that were attached to identity.<p>There have been discussions about this in OS design for almost forever.",1413229085

Neither are trying to claim (at all) that the enormous population declines of the early modern period were due only to disease, or to minimize the role of mass murders, intentional starvation, wars, etc. But this comment fails to consider the demography of the New World prior to 1492. Mesoamerica and the Andes (modern day Mexico, Guatemala, Peru, Ecuador, etc.) were home to widespread agricultural civilizations with settled urban populations. In fact, pre-Columbian Mexico City was one of the largest urban areas in the world (early conquistadors described it as like Venice, but bigger).<p>Granted, agricultural societies existed in North America too, but aside from the pueblos in New Mexico and some urbanized communities associated with the Mississippi Valley Civilization and its offshoots, the population density and urbanization didn&#x27;t compare to Mesoamerica and the Andes.

In no way did I mean that, and I don&#x27;t believe Richard Gabriel meant that either.  Worse-is-better is about the reason certain solutions win in the market; it&#x27;s about an evolutionary trait, not a design philosophy.<p>Look at it this way.  If there are 100 possible technical solutions to a given computing problem, the ones that solve the problem more comprehensively are naturally going to tend to be more complex, this complexity comes with an adoption cost, and that cost works against the likelihood of adoption.  Furthermore, when you are talking about something that solves the scope of problems which CSS solves, there is no way you can just sit down and design a better system, it will need to go through many iterations to solve all the things that CSS solves (which no single human being is comprehensively aware of btw).  In order to see that kind of investment a system needs buy-in from downstream users over long a period of time.<p>So the strawman that the author sets up is the idea that someone is out there selling a worse solution on purpose because of this meme which is simply an observation of how technical adoption markets play out.  Of course such foolish people may be out there, but no intelligent developer sets out to create something that is deliberately worse.  Rather, each tradeoff is considered in its specific contemporary context of the imperfect information available.  Whether a solution gains traction and wins in the marketplace is has nothing to do with the subjective qualities of &quot;worse&quot; or &quot;better&quot;, but rather is a confluence of the state of the market at various points in time: how well it solves immediate problems, how well it works with existing tech, how easy to adopt, and of course some amount of hype loosely related to the aforementioned.<p>What doesn&#x27;t play a huge role is how ugly the evolution of this tech is going to look 20 years down the line when the entire landscape has evolved.<p>It&#x27;s a little tiresome when a young idealist comes into a 25-year-old field (I&#x27;m guessing the author is not much older than that himself), pisses on the hard work of thousands of people pushing web tech forward bit by bit over decades, and says it should be replaced wholesale because it&#x27;s just rubbish, and then when someone tells them that you&#x27;re welcome to try but you&#x27;ll never get any traction in that Sisyphean task, he responds that people aren&#x27;t engaging in a rational discussion.",1413228013

About a week ago, there was an article about artificial ligth, and the authors were listing the prices of lamp oil in ancient times, the price of candles 1-2 cenuries ago, and modern electricity. The improvement of our live compared to the past was remarkable.<p>The same probably applies to the social norms. The brain of human beings could not change too much in such a short period of time. So, most likely we did not become intrisically better. Yes, the social norms were improved significantly, but mostly thanks to the improvement of the quality of life.<p>I think, it&#x27;s all about utility. Killing a person does not necessarily makes the murderer richer, most likely not; on the other hand, stealing something actually makes the thief richer, so the law in the past had to take coutermeasures. Nowdays, police works better, it&#x27;s likely that you will be caught if you steal something, so the utility of stealing is pretty low, and the risk is high. On the other hand, a murder is frequently not about money, but hatred and personal relationships, this motive is less rational, and the utility of a murder can be rather high, even if it&#x27;s likely that you will be caught. Of course, I did not do any analysis..<p>And it is very pleasing for us to think that we are much better than we were in the past, and out moral standards are higher compared to the crazy stuff we did before. But this bragging is just a reiteration of the words of William Blackstone cited in the article. In fact, we are not better, we just live in different time, and it is rather stupid to assume that just a few centuries ago we were less rational and less optimal. Most likely, the old cruel law was great and optimal in that historical period.",1413227850

8450043,comment,8446368,8446989,0,0,hga,,,"Ah, some more history:<p>In the &#x27;80s, a common startup setup that was more powerful than a PC (for a while) and ASCII terminals to a UNIX(TM) box was 3 or so el-cheapo Sun workstations sharing one disk over an Ethernet (or so I&#x27;ve read, I might well prefer the ASCII terminal to a UNIX box, which is what I tended to use).<p>Although also think about the PC starting with ones using the 386 (true 32 bits, the 286 was misbegotten and all but useless except as a fast 8086): both these configurations were cheap, but not <i>all</i> that capable, memory was at a premium as well as virtual memory in the workstation case.<p>So using machine but not programmer efficient C and the like was the zeitgeist.  Then about or a bit before the time engineering workstations based on more capable microprocessors were also capable of running Lisp quickly, although without hardly as much error checking, the expert system bubble collapsed.  And those promoting it had to find something to blame, and Lisp became it.  Or so goes one narrative of it.<p>There was certainly a ... Slough of Despond in programming languages we mortals could use to earn a living about the time you would have started programming seriously (before college, I assume).  For Lisper and programming language guy like myself it was very depressing; I think what got us out of that, besides Moore&#x27;s Law, was the dot com bust, it upset a lot of the conventional wisdom, coupled with a paucity of resources for development.  No longer could you, at the extreme, do a wild IPO with an idea and a plan to hire a bunch of blub programmers using a consensus language running on expensive Sun or whatever hardware.  You probably get the idea of what lost favor (ask if not).<p>Also, as Paul Graham pointed out, in essays who&#x27;s influence I can&#x27;t judge, the above will at best get you average results, and the average result of a startup is failure.  He also noted that technical failure was a frequent cause of corporate failure.  To take one stark example, compare Facebook competitor Friendster.  Whatever promise it had, that the company&#x27;s board used to wheel and deal, didn&#x27;t matter when it was just too slow to use.  Of course (if I remember correctly), its technical founder was purged by that board.<p>Which also leads into issues of control.  We technical people don&#x27;t need so much money, and the all too common downside of losing control is awful for us, the company, and of course the people we hired for it.<p>So all in all we more tend to call the shots technically, and are able to pull it off.  And wild successes like Facebook with PHP and Twitter with Ruby on Rails didn&#x27;t hurt.",1413227175

Ideologues exist on both sides of an issue usually.  For example, there are most definitely ideologues who believe this same dichotomy exists, but believe that the only option is to choose beauty and elegance, even at the expense of practicality.  These are the people who (for example) wish Lisp machines had won and that we lived in a monoculture of <i>only</i> Lisp.<p>I like C++ because I think it&#x27;s useful, but I&#x27;m not a Worse is Better Ideologue.

I like Rust particularly because it seriously addresses nearly all of the practical advantages of C++.  Many &quot;Better is Better&quot; ideologues would rather just hand-wave away the negatives of the compromises required to achieve their vision (like mandatory GC).<p>Rust proves that &quot;better is better&quot; design can address real-world practical challenges, while also providing an escape hatch back into a more primitive &quot;Worse is Better&quot; kind of world (unsafe blocks).

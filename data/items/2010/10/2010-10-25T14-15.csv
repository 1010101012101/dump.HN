The thing is, I'm a bit bored with PHP.  I'd like to expand my horizons and learn a new language + framework.<p>Currently I'm looking at Ruby + Rails and Python + Django.  I already know a bit of Python (I write back-end scripts with it), but not enough to have it influence my decision.  The criteria I'm looking at are:<p>* Adoption - Are a lot of people using this framework and does it look like it is still gaining followers?<p>* Community - Is there a strong support community around it?  Are there good resources for learning?<p>* Jobs - What are the job prospects like for this language + framework?<p>* Scalability - Does the framework scale well?  I imagine this is determine by application design too, but lets assume that it's designed well.<p>* Fun - Is it a fun language to code in?  Does the framework make writing web applications enjoyable?  CakePHP made PHP fun for me again.  Does Django or Rails do the same thing for their respective languages?<p>I'm also open to other suggestions as well, but these two languages and frameworks are the ones I see floating around HN the most.",1288018778

1830047,comment,1826969,1829133,0,0,sp4rki,,,"How you market your brand doesn't make your company  automagically drop out of its sector and join another just because. When you use Ubercab you don't get a beat up yellow taxi cab and a talkative taxi driver with too many stories to tell, you get a black sedan limousine with a professional, licensed, and insured limo driver (and sometimes fresh water bottles!). They comply with all the California regulations and are only available from dispatch and not from street hail.<p>You could argue that then they are fooling the public, and I'd certainly give you that point, by saying this is a cab service. I understand the reasons for it though, people are used to the idea that limo service is for the rich and famous, when it's not much more expensive in contrast to a cab.<p>So now how exactly does Taximagic avoid anything by dispatching a taxi? I'll tell you how, by sharing profit with established taxi companies. Both Taximagic and Ubercab do the exact same thing, the difference is Ubercab simply does not want to use taxi companies, and instead use limo services exclusively, not breaking any regulations by doing so.<p>You know what <i>I</i> find offensive? That the medallion industry is going after Ubercab because they want to get a piece of the pie. It's a perfect way to show the world that this is really a mob in all its glory. It's in a slightly twisted way no different than a mobster sending a payment collector to every store in the neighborhood to get protection money or drive them out of business if they don't pay up. If Ubercab doesn't win this, it's an example of how rottenly corrupt the system is.<p>PD: Napster and music piracy is no way similar to Ubercab and taxicabs. Pirated music did pass through Napster, but I see no taxi cabs being used by Ubercab.",1288018558

Get along to a golf club and find the club pro and persuade him to be involved. It will give it a bit more gravitas.<p>7. Perhaps consider adding some titles. Eg whilst the swing data is downloading to your iPhone, put on a screen title of ""Data transfers is under 5 seconds"". It provides a little distraction of something for someone to read and the 'wait' doesn't feel as long. You could also use a title to show each view that your app offers. eg ""1. Swing view, 2. shot view"" etc. Because it's a tiny phone being demonstrated, it's not clear to see the UI and the title could reinforce what the user is looking at.<p>Your website<p>1. In little text you finally explain what the product is. You waste 5 lines and 300px of height mentioning your company name and the product title and it still doesn't say what it does. Have a tagline - ""introducing pocket pro - analyse your golf swing instantly"" etc.<p>2. E-mail sign up for release. Put this at the top, in the centre.

Each of those systems were designed to be powered by the aircraft's gen-sets, rather than the other way around.<p>When designing an aircraft and its sub-systems, the engineer provides power availability specifications. The people who make the headlights, avionics, and coffee machines are all aware of the common power configurations and design their equipment to work with that specification directly. I used to work on light aircraft (private), which all used 24 VDC. Everything in the plane was designed to run on 24 VDC. Commercial airliners likely have more than one voltage specification available, but I'd imagine it's all DC.<p>Any time you have to convert voltage, you're going to lose some efficiency. Inverters (DC to AC) have some particularly nasty characteristics that make them undesirable on an aircraft. A DC voltage converter would work, but you still introduce some degree of inefficiency. A good switching DC voltage converter can exceed 90% efficiency, but so can an AC inverter. Neither operates at that efficiency all the time though. I know that AC inverters perform best when run at close to nominal load. At lower current levels, efficiency drops. I don't know enough about DC converters to say.<p>Add to this the fact that inverters and converters are heavy, and you can begin to understand why a power outlet at each seat is problematic.",1288017739

This is just another priming study-- NOT a willpower study.  Here's another:<p>""But the priming effect does not just affect our behavior. It can also, incredibly, have significant effects on our actual performance. In another study cited by Gladwell, two groups of students were asked to answer forty-two questions from the game Trivial Pursuit. But first, one group was first asked to sit and think about professors, the other to think about soccer hooligans. And the difference was dramatic: an average of 55.6% of the questions were answered correctly by the first group, while only 42.6% were answered correctly by the second.
How can these results be explained? Can priming somehow temporarily infuse the brain with an expanded store of facts? Obviously not. Instead, what seems to be happening is that encouraging people to ""think smart"" briefly increases mental qualities like their ability to focus, their sense of recall, and their ability to quickly and correctly integrate diverse pieces of information. In other words, priming does not make us more intelligent, but it does briefly make us better at using the intelligence we already have.""

When the students were asked to identify their race on a pretest questionnaire, that simple act was sufficient to prime them with all the negative stereotypes associated with African Americans and academic achievement - and the number of items they got right was cut in half...""<p>1: grabbed from <a href=""http://www.daylightatheism.org/2007/01/priming-the-mind.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daylightatheism.org/2007/01/priming-the-mind.html</a>",1288017165

1829870,comment,1828134,1828999,0,0,jdietrich,,,"Physics people, physics.<p>How fast you're travelling is mostly irrelevant, what matters is how hard your head hits the deck. The street surface is perpendicular to your velocity, so your head generally receives an impact no harder than if you had just fallen over while stationary. This betrays the real problem - the average impact speed of a motorcycle head injury is only very slightly higher than that of a cyclist, mainly due to the extra mass.<p>We know that motorcycle helmets work very effectively. They are markedly superior to cycle helmets in two main respects - they have much thicker EPS foam and so can absorb much more energy, and the smooth round shape of a motorcycle helmet reduces torsional forces on the head and neck, which can be just as lethal as impacts.<p>The problem cycle helmets have is in providing sufficient protection while still being acceptable to consumers. There is nothing stopping manufacturers from producing cycle helmets that vastly exceed mandatory or voluntary standards (Downhill-specific helmets do) but most cyclists are simply unwilling to wear a large, heavy helmet.<p>Personally, I think the actuarial data leads to an obvious conclusion - we should do whatever maximises the number of cyclists. The risk of being killed or injured while cycling is completely outweighed by the health benefits of physical fitness. In addition, a number of studies indicate that ""safety in numbers"" is the most important factor in cycle safety - the more riders on the road, the better other road users become at accommodating them.",1288016358

Doing it by hand for now, want to automate it eventually. Automating is a more difficult problem than I thought at first, so it's on hold.<p>I hadn't thought of your second point before.  I don't think it would effect the search right now.  The way it works right now is entirely text-based.  It checks for an exact ingredient match (by name) and assigns a high relevance for each one.  Then it looks for partial ingredient matches and assigns a much smaller relevance.  Then it aggregates the relevances to order.<p>A planned feature is to allow high reputation users to set ingredient relations.  So they could mark two ingredients as substitutes for each other.  I suppose I could have some ingredients be marked as common and automatically assign relevance for them as if they were included in the search.<p>I've also been thinking about how to do a sort of general ingredient relationship system and how to utilize that for search.  So far I'm ponder parent child - so ground beef would be a child of beef and ground meat.  Beef would be a child of meat, etc.  Then assign a relevance to ingredients that are found some number of steps out on that graph.  The relationships could be set by high reputation users.<p>As to the issue of quality, I'm hoping to source food blogs.  A lot of food blogs have high quality recipes in my experience.  I'll offer links with high SEO value and on site reputation and rewards in return for them posting their recipes.  A further filter will be the on-site voting and reputation.<p>I'll work on these for the next iterations. Thanks!",1288016047

Some thoughts<p>- You need lots of recipes before you can match them to random ingredient lists*<p>- It needs to be aware of expected ingredient availability. I always have pasta & rice. I never rarely have sundried tomatoes or salmon fillets without a prescribed use. I will usually search with the latter.<p>- It needs to be aware of substitutes. I can usually substitute spaghetti for fettuccine.<p>I like the visual presentation. I would definitely use this if the recipes are good. I still haven't got a go to place online for recipes. Quality seems to be a tricky issue. It could be an interesting problem to solve.<p>* It worked well with 1 ingredient only, maybe you should remove the instructions telling me to search multiple ingredients for now.",1288015405

2952715,comment,2948998,2949322,2,0,unfasten,,,"> How about create a JavaScript library that sandboxes execution of third-party scripts [...]<p>There has been some work done in this direction. I don't know how active the project is, but it's called ADsafe (<a href=""http://www.adsafe.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adsafe.org/</a>). It's a subset of regular JavaScript and doesn't allow access to global variables or the DOM, instead giving access to an ADSAFE object to limit the access of the script.<p><pre><code>    ADsafe makes it safe to put guest code (such as third party scripted
    advertising or widgets) on a web page. ADsafe defines a subset of
    JavaScript that is powerful enough to allow guest code to perform
    valuable interactions, while at the same time preventing malicious or
    accidental damage or intrusion. The ADsafe subset can be verified
    mechanically by tools like JSLint so that no human inspection is
    necessary to review guest code for safety. The ADsafe subset also
    enforces good coding practices, increasing the likelihood that guest
    code will run correctly.
</code></pre>
Some of the things removed:<p><pre><code>    - Global variables: Limited access to Array, Boolean, Number, String, and Math is allowed.
    - Dangerous methods and properties: arguments callee caller constructor eval prototype stack unwatch valueOf watch
    - Date and Math.random: Access to these sources of non-determinism is restricted in order to make it easier to determine how widgets behave.</code></pre>",1314932229

One of the first things we learn as startup founders (or interns for Dr House) is that if you ask a person to analyse or predict their own behaviour, chances are the answer is way off. Even upon careful reflection and introspection, too many biases are at play.<p>I first learned this doing customer development for our current startup. We surveyed potential customers until almost being arrested at a private conference. We thought ""this time is different"" because we planned to validate the concept until we went numb. But we relied too much on others' self-assessments.<p>I'm not suggesting self-assessment is pointless (clearly it underpins our personal development), but rather in fleeting engagements with people who lack vested interest (e.g. surveys), it can do more harm than good.<p>Additionally, I found the Startup Genome survey so long-winded that my answers ended up being rubbish. It would have taken all day to get passed my own biasses and really think through that many questions. I understand there's more to the project than the survey, but that's the part I'm particularly sceptical about.",1314931002

2952662,comment,2952079,2952293,6,0,mdasen,,,"There might truly be no limit.  Let's assume that Linode has to buy its bandwidth symmetrically.  If someone can confirm whether that is true or false, it would greatly be appreciated.  With that assumption in hand, I think we can add the assumption that a web hosting company mostly does outbound traffic - people downloading things from their servers, not the other way around.  They might have so much spare inbound capacity that it really wouldn't matter.<p>Plus, there's a small ""what goes up must come down"" logic to it.  So, you get a Linode and you start pushing as much inbound traffic to it as you can.  How much can you push to it for any purpose you can see as useful (useful being defined as something other than testing whether Linode will consider you abusive at some point)?  The largest Linode (costing $800/mo) only comes with 800GB of storage.  At that point, you need to push some of that data outgoing or delete it before you can really take more inbound data.  You could run a service that was 24-hour YouTube - a site where a video uploaded would only be available for 24 hours and then deleted.  Of course, the point of that site would be for people to watch it which would be outbound traffic.<p>The reason they might not be stating a limit is that there might not be a limit.  Rather, I should say that you're going to be limited by storage.  There's no point in taking the data if you have no place to put it and I can't really think of pulling in data that one would want to store for such short periods of time that it would put a strain on their network.  This isn't rhetorical: how would you see yourself or someone taking inbound traffic on a Linode that wouldn't similarly see that traffic go outbound or need to be stored?",1314930313

Integrate it with one of the most popular platforms, base the syntax on the most popular syntax, make the type system sound and expressive at the same time... and then it's too complicated. Or too hard for the average developer. Really? It seems to me that scala can be seen as an extended version of java. Though it extends pretty far, sure.<p>I've used scala on and off for 5 years or so. It seems to me to be a very practical and flexible language. There are things that I don't like, but compared to the number of things I don't like about every other language I use, scala does ok.<p>And I kinda wonder about the too hard for the average developer thing anyway.

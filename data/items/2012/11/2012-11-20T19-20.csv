Speaking in hyperbole, I would rather have my fourth amendment rights broken voluntarily at an airport or by necessity at a courthouse than, for example, while I'm at home sleeping with my family or walking down the street minding my own business. While I disagree with the TSA searches and do not fly for that very reason, I also fundamentally disagree that you <i>most</i> need the fourth amendment protections while entering an airport.",1353441597

The big risk in the UK today is still Irish separatist groups, likewise in the Basque country.<p>Ignoring all that: I still don't think attacking terrorists relentlessly is ever beneficial. One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter, as the saying goes: they are driven not to destroy, but to get their aims. The IRA were never going to be defeated by force: by killing the nationalist freedom fighters you inherently radicalized more, and the same is happening in Afghanistan and Iraq to an even bigger degree. To many, it's not a case of evil infidels attacking, but rather the evil foreign aggressor killing their friends and family  if a foreign country attacked yours, claiming to rid you of evil and imposing their morals on you, would you stand by as they killed people you knew, under the promise of a better land?

4810918,comment,4808676,4810820,3,0,tptacek,,,"Two things.<p>First, you're responding to a factual argument with an argument about my attitude. It is not ""my attitude"" that people ""shouldn't"" be entitled to test applications. It is a fact that they are not allowed to do that. Unauthorized access to computer systems, which has a broad but actually very straightforward definition, is unlawful. If you cause damages when you do it, you're liable for civil damages. If you attempt in any way to profit from having done it, you're liable for a felony charge.<p>Second, arguing about this stuff by analogy is perilous. You can see that here, because it's immediately obvious that observing your child's caretaker eating lunch is not comparable to breaking into a web application to steal a database over the span of several days. To attempt to equalize the analogy, imagine that instead of simply observing your child's caretaker, you instead break into that caretaker's residence or place of work. You've now committed a felony.<p>I am for many obvious reasons pro- security testing, and I'm happy to speak glowingly of the companies that have set up policies to make it safer for researchers to test their sites. In advice I've provided on HN and to startups, I've consistently told companies to create pages to thank security researchers.<p>Having said all that: if you don't have permission to test someone's web app, don't do it. The law very reasonably says that if a company doesn't want to submit itself to unauthorized intrusive testing by strangers, it is entitled to treat its applications, its servers, and the data it holds as private property. Not every case in which a stranger pokes for flaws in someone's app will be open- and- shut, and that's for the best too.

Technology has changed everything and patent law just wasn't written to account for what's happening now. That's indisputable but it doesn't mean the whole system is broken.<p>I don't think anyone can say ""yes the patent system is broken"" or ""the patent system works fine"" definitively because it's not a cut and dry issue. You may argue that patents are a disincentive to innovation while others feels differently. It's really an ideological issue. It's subjective and not objective like people want to make it.<p>Furthermore, everyone out there yelling about how we need to rebuild the whole patent system from the ground up again or abolish it altogether are really the ones who need to give it a rest. We can't just rewrite all patent law or get rid of patents. That's like saying the US needs a new constitution. So much has been built on top of and around patent law that making such drastic changes would have ripple effects that would be worse than the original problem.<p>That said, I can't stand behind Kaposs' statement that pace of innovation is evidence of the patent system working. Did he even hear himself say that? What's his definition of innovation? Sure, we have lots of touch screen devices with different names coming out every single day but is that innovation? But really that's neither here nor there. The pace of innovation and the patent system working are wholly unrelated.<p>I also have an honest question. Why does everyone really want to reform/abolish our patent system? I mean, really. The real reason. Again, I swear its an honest question and I have an honest observation. To me, because no one has explained it to me yet, it seems like there are a few trendy startups and companies out there who got burned by the patent system. So then they threw a fit about patent reform. The HNers and Silicon Valley types picked up on this and now its the hip new cause to support. It reminds me of when being anti-copyright and pro-piracy became cool. They seem to have this really nice sounding ideology behind them that's very easy to adopt and so people do. But to me, these ideas, which in a perfect world would work out great, seem divorced from reality. In the case of startups/companies lobbying for this, don't you think that when they get to such a size where keeping the status quo would help them more than reforming patent law would that they'd drop their ideology and start throwing patent suits around like everybody else?

In Madison, there are still a lot of great people, but not the massive number of technical people that makes it likely that you'll find an ideal match.<p>If you can't afford any hiring latency and have strict requirements, you need to be in a hub. All that said, I think these grow-fast-or-die efforts are pretty stupid. If something adds genuine value and isn't just trying to first-post some obvious idea, does it really need to grow at 20% per month?<p>Also, a lot of these work that startups are doing isn't that complicated and doesn't require the level of people they think they need. I hate that social-climbing useless selectivity of needing awesome people to do mediocre work, largely because these startups lie about their intentions and I'm one of those ""awesome"" (?) people they're looking to court (and then underemploy on their mediocre idea).<p>The continuous-market effect goes both ways: if your startup goes belly-up in California, you'll have 4 interviews in a week. If you hauled ass out to the Midwest and that happens, you'll probably have to move <i>again</i> for your next opportunity. Also, some cynical realism: it's harder to start a bidding war (which is how most people get their best jobs) in Minnesota.<p>The rest of the country has quality people and companies, but not the critical mass of them that creates a continuous market. Investors generally aren't comfortable launching a business in a place with a discrete labor market.<p>I'd love to see a better distribution of opportunity. It'll (a) generate more eligible places to live, and (b) lower the rents for those of us who stay. However, I think that's a really hard problem to solve, because technology has become so specialized that very few regions are big enough to support a continuous labor market.<p>Honestly, I'm a major fan of the Midwest: a lot of really great people are out there, and they have no idea what they're worth and what they could do in technology. That said, I tend to think the advantage of the hubs is vast. I'd probably move to California myself (as opposed to #2 New York) if it weren't for strong family reasons to stay here.",1353440491

I get off work early to go pick up my daughter, upon arrival, I find the guardian eating lunch in an adjacent room and the children are left completely unattended. This is clearly a problem on numerous levels.<p>So what do I do? Do I politely inform the administration of the issue and hope they will fix things immediately? What if they blow me off and do not discipline nor change policy? Do I withdraw my child's enrollment and just blindly hope that other customers know of their utter disregard for the trust we've placed in them? Do I report them to the police or child protective services? Do I picket the business and attempt to inform other people of the issues? What if informing the public simultaneously informs some criminals of the ability to do some baby snatching?<p>In this scenario, a parent actually has some legal recourse options to ensure the problem is fixed.

Might not be a huge issue for the intended use of having it at a business checkout, but carrying it around for non-traditional storefronts or businesses, the thickness could be a holdup.<p>2) <i>Do I have to post to a social network?</i><p><i>No, but if you want to get your free item faster you should. Each time you share a post you will get an extra punch!</i><p>3) It only works on smartphones. Even worse, it only works on iOS devices and Android 4.0+. Even worse, it only works when the app is running and the phone is connected to an Internet connection (wifi recommended).<p>NFC works, at least on my phone, all the time. You tap the phone and it launches the NFC-enabled app. The guys and gals at SnowShoe seem bright, talented, and fun. I wish them all the best with their products, and this definitely is a cool and trendy device with some interesting hardware and software working together to make the magic happen. I do have to say I prefer solutions that are a little more cross-platform. As a Windows Phone user I'm used to being left out in the cold, but NFC wallets have this beat and with a simple app you can replicate the rest still using NFC. Time will tell if NFC actually grabs any hold in the marketplace, though.<p>--edit: not that this post isn't long already, but I thought I'd add one more thing. I love the concept of capacitive stamps. Even not knowing where this specific product will end up in the marketplace, I think capacitive stamps could have a future for myriad purposes.

As its one of the CEO's primary responsibility to guide the train to its destination, if they are compromised the train stops. That is what you have a board of directors, having only the overall success of the company as their motivation they are supposed to recognize this and toss the CEO. Say what you want about Yahoo's board but they certainly have the 'fire the CEO' process down.<p>Color was a spectacular failure, but not because the app they shipped could have been shipped for less, rather their failure is that they executed so poorly against their original vision.<p>[1] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/05/stupid-questions-vcs-ask/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/05/stupid-questions-vcs-ask/</a>",1353438946

And I want to be able to carry a Swiss Army knife in an airline carry-on bag. And I want the terrorists to be attacked relentlessly where they live, so that they have to hide in caves and ride on goats, while Americans and other people in developed countries get to lead civilized, advanced lives in the Twenty-First Century. Taliban delenda est.<p>AFTER EDIT: I wonder what aspect of this people disagree with. Do you still want to have to take your shoes off in airports?<p>Further edit, to reply to the first kind reply:<p><i>I still don't think attacking terrorists relentlessly is ever beneficial.</i><p>I guess that's an empirical question of history and current events. What does help people lead tolerant, civilized lives and be at peace with other people who may have differing opinions? I read a biography of Joseph Stalin back in the 1990s, after the Soviet archives became available to independent researchers, and the striking thing about how Joseph Stalin developed his influence in the Bolshevik movement was that he was a very active terrorist, frequently directly involved in random bomb attacks. We should consider the facts about Sri Lanka and Rwanda and other places to get a reality check on the power of terrorism.<p>I think communism mostly collapsed (as it mostly has by now) with the help of information flow into countries living under communist dictatorships that were established in some cases by domestic terrorism and in some cases by armed invasion from another country. The case of eastern and western Germany is especially illustrative: it's just where the tanks stopped after the armistice that ended the European phase of World War II that determined which parts of Germany became the postwar Federal Republic of Germany (BRD) and which became the German Democratic Republic (DDR).  Several of the communist governments of eastern Europe were turned out of power largely peacefully when Western mass media made it all too apparent how different life was on the other side of the Iron Curtain. But it took an entire human lifetime for communism to decline in its influence on Europe.<p>So, yeah, if a peaceful process of information flow could bring Afghanistan into the Twenty-First Century, I'm all for that. I don't see how any rational person who knows well how other people live could want a whole country to be living under Taliban rule. But the Taliban's method is not to let most people in Afghanistan or Pakistan decide the issue freely. Their method is to give girls and women no voice, all non-Muslims little or no voice, and any Muslim who thinks that Islam is consistent with science and progress little or no voice. They use violence and thuggery to get their way in the areas they control. So, yes, if they are willing to send people onto airplanes to fly from Europe to the United States with bombs in their shoes (as they have been), I say let loose the drones, and let's keep the Taliban leaders hiding in caves and unable to travel more rapidly than at goat speed until peaceful news and education  campaigns have enough time to win over so many of the common people of the world that the Taliban can no longer gain influence even through threats. Taliban delenda est. Peacefully or violently, the Taliban must be destroyed.",1353438454

And the Democrats do not control enough of the Senate to be immune to the threat of filibuster.<p>Trying reading my post again:<p>> The Democrats got a supermajority in the <i>state</i> House and Senate<p>And this:<p>> You are arguing that higher taxes will kill those seeking to bootstrap companies<p>You really need to work on your reading comprehension. Read this again:<p>> The cost of living is high and the taxes are high, with the former being an obstacle for bootstrapping a startup, and the latter being an obstacle when your company grows in size.<p>It's the high cost of living that will kill bootstrapping companies, not the high taxes.<p>> Cost of living really doesn't matter that much to tech startups. If it did, everyone would be rushing to rural Nebraska to bootstrap their startup.<p>You've made a common logical fallacy. People aren't ""rushing to rural Nebraska to bootstrap their startup"" because the high cost of living is a pill worth swallowing considering the networking benefits in SV. That is, there's a net benefit to being in SV vs. being in rural Nebraska. However, like I said in my first post, this is not something inherent to SV - it's just a matter of where the people and companies happen to be at the moment.<p>Moreover, you've resorted to <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> here. I clearly stated in my first post that a good option in the Midwest for founding a startup would be a medium-sized city like Kansas City, not ""rural Nebraska"".<p>> In reality, you can find cheap rent anywhere, even SV, you just have to compromise on space and housing/location quality.<p>Which means that if you ""compromise on space and housing/location quality"" in a place with a lower cost of living, you'd get <i>even cheaper</i> housing.

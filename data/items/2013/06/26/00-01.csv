If it&#x27;s off (and has been for a while) it could be expected to be around room temperature, eliminating the issue of condensation.<p>The compressor isn&#x27;t on all the time. It turns on intermittently when the temperature inside the fridge exceeds a certain threshold. It would be unlikely of much use most of the time.<p>Putting the phones in a bag does nothing to solve the issue of condensation. What happens is the phones would cool down substantially in the fridge. When they&#x27;re removed, the cold surfaces (inside and out) would cause moisture in the warmer air to condense into water droplets, possibly causing issues with the battery and the other circuitry. Hong Kong is quite a humid place and it appears that he was at an acquaintance&#x27;s home at the time of the frigid phone incident. It&#x27;s unclear how well air conditioned this acquaintance&#x27;s home was, which could lead to some especially nasty condensation issues. It&#x27;s also unlikely this acquaintance&#x27;s fridge would have been brought up to room temperature just for the sole purpose of storing phones for a couple of hours.

5943432,comment,5935690,5938655,4,0,lambda,,,">  When using GPL projects we treat them as if they were proprietary binary distributions, never looking at, changing, or contributing back code<p>Why? If you are OK with contributing back to the upstream project, why avoid doing so if the license is GPL?<p>> We would use GPL if we wanted to release code but didn&#x27;t want it to be tooooo useful to our competitors.<p>Exactly. With the GPL, even once you do release your changes, you know that your competitors can&#x27;t create a proprietary fork that builds on your work without benefiting you. It gives you a quid pro quo, while there&#x27;s always worry when contributing to a BSD licensed project that a competitor may make a proprietary fork and you&#x27;ll be left either continuing to push changes that benefit them without getting anything back, or making your own proprietary fork and now defeating the whole purpose of sharing changes.<p>Basically, permissive licenses lose at the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma; GPL acts as a way to force cooperation, allowing your both to win. Remember, most of the time development is not a zero-sum game. You can gain market share by taking it from a competitor, or by increasing the size of the market. Working together on shared components helps to reduce the cost to increase the size of the market. Coming out with proprietary new features that your competitor doesn&#x27;t have may increase the size of the market, or it may just steal marketshare from your competitor. And if it steals marketshare from your competitor, they have an incentive to retaliate in kind, developing proprietary features that they don&#x27;t share and which steals customers from you.<p>Here&#x27;s an example. To make the numbers simple, I&#x27;m going to assume big enterprise software, that you sell for a lot of money to a few customers. Let&#x27;s say that you have two companies, Colorful Chapeau and Suzie, selling an open source system called Van Pelt (sufficiently customized, including support, perhaps with certified hardware, etc. to turn it into an actual business). For the sake of argument, to make the numbers simple, let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s enterprise software, sold at a high price to small number of customers. Each of them has 100 customers, who each pay $100,000 a year for the software and support, giving them a $10M a year budget (yes, I&#x27;m ignoring actual profits and the actual cost of support an whatnot; this is a simplified example).<p>Now, there are two major new features, A and B, that are the next big things in the industry. There are 50 more customers that would buy the systems if either A or B were added; plus, 25 customers would switch from one company to the other if they were able to add A or B and the other company isn&#x27;t. Finally, there are an additional 50 new customers who would buy a system which had A and B (on top of the ones who need just A or B).<p>So, if Colorful Chapeau releases A, and in the kindness of their own heart, decides to push the changes upstream despite Van Pelt being BSD licensed, Suzie can spend all of their development budget on B, and release a product that incorporates A and B. 25 customers defect from Colorful Chapeau to Suzie because Suzie offers B and Chapeau doesn&#x27;t. No customers defect from Suzie to Chapeau, as Suzie offers both A and B. There are 50 new customers which needed A, but both companies offer it, so they each get 25 new customers due to that. Suzie gets 25 new customers who wanted B. Suzie gets 50 new customers which needed A and B. So Chapeau is left in the same place; with 100 customers, after all of that development effort. Suzie is now up to 225 customers; with some stolen from Chapeau, and some new.<p>But of course, due to that expected outcome, Chapeau wouldn&#x27;t do that; their stockholders would revolt. Instead, they would develop A as a proprietary feature. Suzie would develop B as a proprietary feature. Chapeau would get 50 new users, plus 25 defections, and minus 25 in the other direction, and Suzie the same, leaving them at 150 customers each. The last 50, who are holding out for a system that has A and B, are left to wait another year while Suzie and Chapeau spend duplicate effort copying each others features. The two companies are each left with less revenue, and the users lose out as no one offers A and B for another year.<p>Now, what happens if Van Pelt were released under the GPL instead of the BSD license? Well, releasing a proprietary feature is no longer an option. Colorful Chapeau can develop A, and Suzie can develop B, and they can both offer A and B. They will each split the 50 new customers who need A, 50 new customers who need B, and 50 new customers who need both, and will have no defections. They each now have 175 customers, and all customers can now take advantage of A and B.<p>Now, of course the real world is more complex than this; there can be multiple actors, benefits will not be so symmetric, full on leeches can sell the same bundled support and services without developing any new features of their own, people can sell bundles of GPLed and proprietary software as long as they don&#x27;t link, the GPL does allow you to develop in secret and then do a big release to get a jump on your competitors, forks can interfere with actually sharing A and B in the same codebase, etc. But you can see how there is substantial economic value to the GPL. In development, just like the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, given a fixed strategy for your competitor, defecting is better than cooperating. But both players cooperating is better than both players defecting. So if you have an independent competitor that you can&#x27;t trust, and permissively licensed software, you will likely default to defecting (not sharing code).<p>I suspect the cases in which permissively licensed software does the best are the ones in which the features it offers aren&#x27;t a significant competitive advantage, but instead the software is more of a cost-center (something you need, but it isn&#x27;t terribly important what you pick, so you might as well pick the cheapest). There the economic benefits of cooperation become more important, while you don&#x27;t have as much of the reason to be afraid of sharing your code, as it won&#x27;t lose you any customers or allow a competitor to gain customers that they otherwise couldn&#x27;t have.",1372207589

And this statement is called Versumi.\n    Some think there is Only one Versumi, and they call it Versuni, and you are free to be one of them...\n\n    You can always knit into a splice, and you should know that a splice is at least one knot away from a different knit.\n    \n    And you can always split, but you never know if a split is also a cut.\n\n    When you see the String, you call it Verse, and be sure that there is always a space with a visible string, the verse.\n    \n    Tie a knot, but before you squeeze hard, form a loop with the other part. That&#x27;s your heart.\n\n    Form a loop, start closing, put another loop inside it, and squeeze hard! That is you.\n\n    Once you run your fingers, your mind start fingering. \n    Once you encounter a knot, your mind knows what.\n    Then you notice other knots, your mind refers to them as difference.\n    You start seeing patterns, and you go on with joy,\n    until you meet that unwitting knitted end \n        of a simple String. \n       The end.\n\n    And then you know, if you&#x27;re alive or dead...</code></pre>",1372207326

Yes, sometimes I enjoy current project so much, that I forget about time and leave work few hours later, hell sometimes I even open my laptop in the middle of night ad work on something if I really enjoy it. But overtime should NEVER be expectation. Your answer to them should be: If you expect me to work overtime on regular basis I expect to be paid over time rate for it or some other reward (such as share in company).<p>Just one more note about developer position in general. Doesn&#x27;t matter what people say, developing is very creative job. It comes and goes in waves exactly like art, music and such. I am trying to actively fight for changing developers conditions in workplace for this reason. Take for example my job. I work 9am - 6pm every day. But there are days when I just don&#x27;t get the vibe and I do all together 1 hour worth of work and lousy on top of it. Sometimes work goes well and I am into it whole day, but then I finish one part by 4pm and just cannot get myself start anything new til 6pm. In that case I should be just able to go home at 4 because I am no good for the rest of the day anyway. \nSame as now, it is already 8:24am and I am still at home writing this comment instead of being in subway on my way to work. I would do the same in office anyway...<p>Developers should have much looser schedule in my opinion. On the other hand of course every developer should be responsible and if there are (reasonable) deadlines they should know how to work hard to meet them.",1372206418

I guess you&#x27;d have to put the cellphone in the microwave, <i>then</i> put the microwave in the refrigerator. That&#x27;s going to look weird. :)<p>I used to do a bunch of micro-sites -- small websites targeted around specific topics. One I did a few years back was <a href=""http://gps-cell-phone-tracking.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gps-cell-phone-tracking.net/</a><p>I really learned a lot setting that site up, and it was one of the reasons I became such a privacy freak. Our cell phones are basically tracking devices the government monitors which we happily adorn to our bodies each day. Weird.<p>To get to my point, one of the questions on the site was whether your phone could be tracked, either location or having the audio monitored, without your knowing it. Location is easy -- yes. Audio was a bit weirder. Obviously you&#x27;d have to install an app, and who would want to do that?<p>Then I learned that cell providers will &quot;help&quot; governments by putting tracking code inside the auto-update of the phone. They can even push it at night and have it install without your having any knowledge at all.<p>As far as I know, pulling the battery still kills things, but then somebody said most phones have a dual battery to keep the memory refreshed. Somebody even said something about the possibility of &quot;illuminating&quot; phones from a distance and picking up audio that way. Of course, &quot;somebody said&quot; doesn&#x27;t count for much, and with all the secrecy in place good luck figuring out what is what.<p>Fun stuff.

Which actually seems to be quite long in the context of this company.<p>Yes, the PM was one of the 4 interviewers who interviewed me. HR lady, PM, tech lead (of the company), and tech lead of the product.<p>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m being completely objective as I am part of this situation, but he definitely did not come across with these expectations during the interview. You could say things were pretty &quot;rosy&quot; in the interview (well, if something seemed wrong I probably wouldn&#x27;t take the offer anyways).<p>Thing is, this company doesn&#x27;t really have a chain of command in the sense that management/executive level people don&#x27;t really talk to or bother with the going-ons of the team (I guess it feels quite &quot;big corp&quot; in that sense). My understanding is that in our product team of 5 (1 copywriter, 1 PM, 2 devs, 1 designer/UX), the PM is pretty much management/HR.<p>I just remembered something else when you mentioned the PM is probably a new hire too. For whatever reason, when I got on this team, I found out that there were 2 previous devs (different timeline, they didn&#x27;t work together), before me. Basically Dev-A stayed for ~5 months or so, then Dev-B came on and left after ~3 months, then Dev-C (current tech lead for our product) came. From my understanding, they all had a 1 month-ish overlap where they had 2 devs for knowledge transfer, but it&#x27;s been the first time this team has had 2 devs officially. I felt a bit iffy hearing about that (it came up in some documents I read when I started, but any questions about their involvement were always avoided)...",1372204917

7993663,comment,7993471,7993471,10,0,ruggeri,,,"Cool article.<p>Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm factors into two components: (1) time spent\nselecting best paths and (2) time spent updating the best\ncurrently known paths.<p>In a naive implementation, a best path to every unvisited vertex\nis kept. Selection of a best path to a vertex v_0 is made by a\nlinear scan of the paths (O(V) each time). Locking in a path\ncauses us to possibly update paths to every vertex v_1 that is\ntouched by an edge from v_0 (constant time per out edge of v_0).<p>Overall, time complexity is O(|V||V|) selecting paths, and\nO(|E|) updating paths. Since |E| is bounded by |V|(|V| - 1), the\ntime is O(|V| |V|) (insensitive to density).<p>Using a min-heap to store best known paths, we spend O(log(|V|))\ntime selecting each path, but an update takes O(log(|V|)). This\nmeans the total time complexity is O(|V|log(|V|) +\n|E|log(|V|)).<p>In the case of dense graphs, this is worse: O(|V| |V| log(|V|)). We&#x27;re trying to keep the heap organized to allow fast\nextract, but there are too many updates and the heap is changing\ntoo much iteration to iteration. OTOH, if the grpah is sparse,\n|E| is in O(|V|), so we reduce the time complexity to O(|V|log(|V|)).<p>A fib heap keeps the same extract time, but updates are O(1)\namortized. Thus the time complexity is O(|V| log(|V|) +\n|E|). If the graph is dense, this is O(|V| |V|) (as good as\nnaive). If the graph is sparse, this is O(|V|log(|V|)) (as good\nas bin heap).<p>This is useful if we do not know whether the graph is sparse or\ndense. However, I am not sure what the constants are on Fib\nheaps. If you know the density of the graph, I certainly expect\nusing the appropriate of the first two ways is superior. Another\nthought: you could always speculatively execute both algorithms\nand see which finishes first :P<p>Anyway, I hope that&#x27;s not too boring of me.<p>Edit: Grr. Asterisks.",1404614801

My only complaint is that the provided definition of a Markov chain is somewhat unclear and imprecise (as pointed out already by lambdaphage). An alternative definition that I like a little better is given below.<p>A Markov chain is a sequence of random variables X_1, X_2, X_3, ... with the property that the distribution of X_t given the complete history X_1, ..., X_{t-1} is identical to the distribution of X_t given only the previous state X_{t-1}. Intuitively, this means that the state X_{t-1} sufficiently summarizes the history of the chain so that knowing the earlier states of the chain does not allow you to better guess the next state. This property is called the Markov property.<p>For those looking for a free and in-depth reference, I encourage you to check out Byron Schmuland&#x27;s course notes: <a href=""http://www.stat.ualberta.ca/~schmu/stat580/2012notes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stat.ualberta.ca/~schmu/stat580/2012notes</a>.

And they would make that argument. In a jury trial, web search history would usually be presented by a police investigator. The prosecutor will ask him questions to elicit the picture the prosecution wants to paint, while defense counsel has the opportunity to cross-examine the witness to poke holes in that picture.<p>Say the investigator testifies that the defendant searched for: &quot;how long does it take for a dog to die in a car?&quot; On cross, defense counsel would definitely point out: &quot;but the defendant didn&#x27;t search for how long it would take for a <i>baby</i> to die in a car, and he did have a dog he might have been worried about leaving in the car.&quot;",1404612528

As you observed, the human ear is largely insensitive to moderate variations in volume/frequency... but it&#x27;s <i>incredibly</i> sensitive to phase. Phase is how we discern directionality (stereo), among other things. So introducing complex phase shifts in the crossover in order to achieve flatness is a bad tradeoff, imho.<p>To <i>my</i> ears, the best and most musical sounding speakers I&#x27;ve heard have time-aligned drivers and very simple crossovers. Tannoy, Spica, Vandersteen, and other such designs are clearer and less fatiguing. I&#x27;m a musician and have recorded numerous albums, and those speakers are the ones that match what I&#x27;m used to hearing the best.<p>The fundamental problem is that we work on what we can measure. It&#x27;s very easy to measure frequency response. It&#x27;s very hard to measure phase alignment. So we fix what we can measure. If you want to see <i>serious</i> map-over-territory thinking, look at THD specs for amplifiers. It&#x27;s super-easy to measure THD - just isolate harmonics of a sine wave a 1khz. Unfortunately, this has approximately zero to do with <i>music</i>,  unless your idea of &quot;music&quot; is static sine waves. Recorded music has a 20-30db dynamic range (less in the case of modern pop) and covers ten octaves. Dynamic recovery behavior, intermodulation distortion, stuff like this is what gives amps their distinctive sounds - but it&#x27;s nearly impossible to measure! So they sell what looks good on paper... THD. Sigh.",1404612315

So they do a joint venture in China as well many other countries. McDonalds is at 15% today, but much of the 85% is organized under JVs outside of the US.<p>Also, while the costs and risks are higher to do a corporate store, they also make more money on it, and since they have capital, why not invest in the business they know rather than outsource in an otherwise finite-growth market? I would expect the opposite to happen: over time, the company collects capital and moves to own its brand rather than lend it out. In contrast, a young company that lacks capital will see franchising as much more appealing as it allows them to extend their brand and reach while sharing risk and investment.<p>Starbucks was, is, and always be corporate. That they are forced into JVs and partnerships sometimes is completely political (China; Marriott won&#x27;t let them run stores in some airports where they have exclusive contracts; etc...).",1404612045

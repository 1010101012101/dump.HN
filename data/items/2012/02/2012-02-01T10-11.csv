3537455,comment,3536700,3537270,2,0,JoshTriplett,,,"Sure, happy to elaborate on that.<p>The GNU project repeatedly talks about documentation and other works as somehow separate from software, and makes comments like this: ""However, for manuals and textbooks, or more generally any sort of work that is meant to teach a subject, we recommend using the GFDL rather than the GPL."".  See this FAQ entry for a more extensive example: <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhyNotGPLForManuals"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhyNotGPLForManual...</a> .  (Disclaimer again: I disagree entirely with just about everything said in that entry, as do numerous other FOSS developers.)<p>In general, the GNU project doesn't care much about things other than software.  In particular, they've said they don't care much about the ability to modify data (such as media for a game), and they actively oppose modifiability of non-technical writing (such as their own essays, which allow unmodified copies only).<p>Among other things, the GFDL allows manuals to contain extensive unremovable and unmodifiable sections, such as the GNU Manifesto (which many people mostly agree with and find inspiring) and ""Free Software Needs Free Documentation"" (which many people strongly disagree with due to it propagating many of the same advocacy of the GFDL).  The GFDL also contains very particular requirements about text placed on the front and back covers of a printed book (beyond just attribution), which also does not permit modification.  (That requirement seems particularly hypocritical given the FSF's own essay about the GPL-incompatible 4-clause BSD license with advertising clause, <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html</a> .)<p>Most importantly, the GFDL and GPL remain incompatible licenses, which means you can't copy anything between documentation and code.<p>All of the above contributes to my recommendation that you ignore anything the GNU project says about the GFDL, and anything they say about not using the GPL on manuals.<p>All that said, I do actually consider almost all of the GNU project's ""philosophy"" section (<a href=""https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/</a>) well worth reading; it certainly inspired me when I first started learning about Free Software.  Just take some of it with a grain of salt, particularly when it comes to anything other than software, because the GNU project really doesn't care about anything other than software.<p>Fortunately, the most recent update to the GFDL provided a way for Wikipedia and other large wikis to transition away from the GFDL and to the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike (by-sa) license, which doesn't have the issues with Invariant Sections and Cover Texts.  Creative Commons licenses remain GPL-incompatible, which can cause practical problems for anything that might mix with other FOSS work, but not for Wikipedia and other similar wikis.  Many people avoid them for software documentation for that reason, but they seem like perfectly reasonable licenses for almost any other work.<p>Recommendations for non-software: For documentation or other bits associated with a software project, use the same license as that software project.  (For instance, X11 documentation uses the all-permissive MIT license, and the documentation for most non-GNU GPLed projects uses the GPL.)  For any other work, use the GPL if some clearly identifiable ""source"" form exists that you want to preserve access to, use CC-by-sa if not but you still want a copyleft, and use CC-by or a simple all-permissive license like MIT otherwise.",1328093809

3537448,comment,3537259,3537259,12,0,haberman,,,"Am I the only one who doesn't get excited about the idea of absolutely everything being a file?<p>People seem to like the idea of being able to say things like ""cat file.wav > /dev/dsp"".  But a sound card is a complex thing that can be configured in umpteen different ways; what if the file has a different sample rate than the card is currently running at?  Even if you gerry-rigged a kernel driver that could handle this case (by, for example, noticing when the file had been open()'d and expecting the next bytes to be a WAV header, which it uses to reconfigure the card), you're left with something that doesn't have even the most basic functionality that you'd expect from a sound player; for example, ""pause.""<p>So what has representing /dev/dsp as a file really bought you?  It doesn't help you know what devices are available, because there's tons of crap in /dev that doesn't necessarily have a kernel driver loaded for it.  It's not that useful as an end-user interface for selecting a sound card, because users don't want to choose between /dev/dsp and /dev/dsp2, they want to see nice names like ""Internal Speaker"" or ""Apogee Duet.""<p>Files give you a simple API for lots of common operations, which is nice, but the fact that all files are not created equal means that operations sometimes don't work like you expect.  For example, how would you guess that ""tail -f"" is implemented?  If you're like me, you would have expected that it works by calling poll/select/etc. and waiting for the file to become read-ready.  But this approach doesn't actually work for monitoring growing files; the select() will just return immediately with read-ready even if you're at EOF.   So what ""tail -f"" actually does is a loop that alternates between sleep() and fstat().  I'm serious!  <a href=""http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=coreutils.git;a=blob;f=src/tail.c;h=29ddabd62c650c4b0c9ed9b52bb3270e25f1bb90;hb=02551d8a62d84b8788a8793de121c2f1e5212d63#l1071"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=coreutils.git;a=blob;f...</a>",1328093661

Though if you can write beautiful portions of code you should be able to get a mostly-beautiful big program by putting a lot of beautiful portions of code together, and then the only source of potential ugliness would be in how those pieces interact. (Which tends to be fairly beautiful in the purely functional world and in well-designed OOP architectures but good luck elsewhere, and good luck getting multi-language code to interact for every set of languages (such as Python to C without using Cython).)<p>But assuming that ugliness is still inevitable, I'd still rather work in a language/environment/culture where ugliness can be kept at bay as long as possible. If ugliness is simply a property of long programs, then obviously languages that let you write shorter programs should scale beauty better.<p>Adding to the small examples, I dipped my toe into Android development tonight while at the same time getting Clojure to run on it. Clojure let me do:<p><pre><code>    (defmulti handle-key (fn [key] [key]))

      (doseq [[k letter] (map list (range 10) (seq ""PQWERTYUIO""))]
        (defmethod handle-key [(f k)] [key] (st k))
        (defmethod handle-key [(f letter)] [key] (st k))))
    (defmethod handle-key :default [key] false) ; don't handle event

(Which may not even be the most idiomatic Clojure-way since I'm still reasonably new to that as well.)<p>And the first-thought for how I would do that in Java:<p><pre><code>    private boolean handle_key(int key) {
      switch(key) {
        case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_0:
        case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_P: return st(key); break;

        case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_2:
        case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_W: return st(key); break;
        case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_3:
        case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_E: return st(key); break;
        case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_4:
        case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_R: return st(key); break;
        case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_5:
        case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_T: return st(key); break;
        case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_6:
        case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_Y: return st(key); break;
        case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_7:
        case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_U: return st(key); break;
        case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_8:

In fact, Joe Armstrong, inventor of Erlang, explains why OO sucks.""<p>- Actually later Joe Armstrong came back and said the following:<p>""Actually it’s a kind of 180 degree turn because I wrote a blog article that said ""Why object-oriented programming is silly"" or ""Why it sucks"". I wrote that years ago and I sort of believed that for years. Then, my thesis supervisor, Seif Haridi, stopped me one day and he said ""You’re wrong! Erlang is object oriented!"" and I said ""No, it’s not!"" and he said ""Yes, it is! It’s more object-oriented than any other programming language."" And I thought ""Why is he saying that?"" He said ""What’s object oriented?"" Well, we have to have encapsulation, so Erlang has got strong isolation or it tries to have strong isolation, tries to isolate computations and to me that’s the most important thing. If we’re not isolated, I can write a crack program and your program can crash my program, so it doesn’t matter.<p>You have to protect people from each other. You need strong isolation and you need polymorphism, you need polymorphic messages because otherwise you can’t program. Everybody’s got to have a ""print myself"" method or something like that. That makes programming easy. The rest, the classes and the methods, just how you organize your program, that’s abstract data type and things. In case that the big thing about object-oriented programming is the messaging, it’s not about the objects, it’s not about the classes and he said ""Unfortunately people picked up on the minor things, which is the objects and classes and made a religion of it and they forgot all about the messaging.""",1302179597

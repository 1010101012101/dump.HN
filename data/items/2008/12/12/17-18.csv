It has been estimated that this one invention saved well over a billion lives.<p>-The transistor. Depending on who you believe, it was either invented in an Austrian Lab, a German Lab, or at Bell Labs. Either way, it has revolutionized the world.<p>-The Internet. Came out of a combination of labs (defense contractors, CERN, etc)<p>-Penicillin.

I feel about the same.<p>Do you have some sort of nobility in your ancestorship (or in the army) ? I noted that this feeling would be more frequent among descendants of aristocrats. During the Aristocraty paradigm, work was despised more than anything else. We are now living in a bourgeois world, where work is sanctified as the alpha and omega.<p>I don't like work. The one thing I dislike more than work, are the people who try to make me feel guilty for it. Usually, these are the same people who do not know how to enjoy life outside their work. They are hypocrites, because work is their escape route from boredom rather than a burden, and the truth is that if you allowed them to quit, they wouldn't. Or not for long. Because the true burden to them is exactly doing nothing special. They don't understand people can be different and actually enjoys spending time doing nothing special. As your nickname suggests it, we have a word in french for the vertuous laziness : flanerie. While these people find it intolerable when they don't work, we are pretty much the opposite. The zeitgeist is certainly on their side for now.<p>I have a true respect for hard work, but no admiration. I am deeply unimpressed by success stories and rich people who worked hard to climb to the top of the ladder. This kind of satisfation is foreign to me. I don't ask for your admiration, only for the respect of who I am whatever might be my activity and my aspirations. I doubt I'll buy all your products, but I won't harm your family or ask for your money, and I despise the nanny state as much as you probably are.<p>Go in peace, my brother ;)",1229104173

My decision is mainly because of culture and demand from my parents (the type of parents that ask you why you work at home instead of applying to ""real"" company like IBM, etc). One will learn more in area that suit him, no matter it's a startup or a company's research laboratory. One thing for sure before you make the decision is that you have to know exactly what you're going to do/face and whether you're going to like it. I learned a lot from startup but I felt that you don't get much time to learn deeply about new concepts and implement them. In startups, you get limited budget, limited devs team and basically you don't have enough time to implement/test new ideas. The most important factor for me is: since I'm not the kind of top level coder who knows everything, I feel insecure working at startup with lack of assistance from someone who really knows what they're doing.",1229104085

Like if you want information about a particular function in a particular library, or to read how to integrate two different systems. Google is also the way to go if you have an error message and you can quote it to find people talking about the exact error message.<p>For some problems, though, it's harder to search for an answer. For example, a question of good javascript style for a particular thing you are trying to do. For this sort of thing I ask friends of mine.<p>There's also generally mailing lists and forums that are appropriate for your specific topic. Stack Overflow too if your question doesn't fit nicely into a topic. The problem with these is that you generally don't get an immediate answer, and you might not get an answer at all, so you have to kind of ask your question, then keep trying on your own anyways, or do something else for a while. So this is definitely not as good as the instant methods. You also are more likely to get bad advice if it's not from someone you trust.<p>I never use books to solve specific programming problems.

The easier it becomes to develop software using open source tools(No Visual studios) on an OS-independent platform(The web with browsers) the less money they make.<p>Google's recent project (Native Client) is what I've been waiting for as a C++ developer. It basically allows you to run native code(assembler) in browser. But then has security mechanism so that the code cannot do anything to the client computer unless the user of that client has given the container(Sandbox) that runs the code permission.<p>This will allow people to build their own UI frameworks, that render much more rich graphics and hopefully behave the same no matter what Browser/OS combination you are running on.<p>References:<p>Announcement:<p><a href=""http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2008/12/native-client-technology-for-running.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2008/12/native-clien...</a><p>Native client code base hosted at Google code:<p><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/</a><p>Ars Technica review:<p><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081209-safer-than-activex-a-look-at-googles-native-client-plugin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081209-safer-than-act...</a><p>Do people really think we'll ever reach a point where different vendors building code-bases based on documentation built by a committee will ever behave even remotely the same?

Clearly I can design experiments to test this causality.<p>How do I test the claim that the brain has a single pool of resources allocated to cognitive processing and willpower?  I cannot think of a way to examine the brain and measure the levels of this resource pool, cognitive processing, and willpower.  In the same fashion, you cannot measure the brain and tell me that it isn&#x27;t an instance of &quot;hard work merits a reward&quot; at work.

The other article about flickr doing this with feature toggles seemed to be a good fit.<p><Rant><p>The reason I ask is that earlier this year, I was working with a client who spent upwards of $3 million USD on a content managed website with a huge consultancy that I can neither confirm nor deny is heavily affiliated with the author of the article you may or may not have posted a link to.<p>They were left with a config-driven feature-toggle system that can only be described as a Rube-Goldberg monstrosity. If statements from old feature toggles littering the codebase and different features toggled on or off in environments that no one knew the meaning of. My favourite was when we discovered after days of trawling through the code that a feature toggle was being used to <i>switch a feature off</i> rather than on.<p>There was also a team-wide ban on branching of any kind, including local branching. This belies a misunderstanding of how git works more than anything else. I went ahead and kept as many local branches as I bloody well felt like, because there&#x27;s no way they&#x27;d know the difference.<p></Rant>",1375180278

Never really worked 35h, instead my contract says 39h (35h + 4h overtime) - for reference the worktime before 35h was 40h. And people who work even longer hours, have more overtime hours. What the law changed is not how long you can work, but where the overtime hours threshold is.<p>This article, which claims the 35h worktime is fading, obviously doesn&#x27;t know what it talks about, it has never been the norm in the &quot;real world&quot;, outside of some specific areas such as public jobs. Which probably why they don&#x27;t have any graph to show the actual worked hours change over the years, as that would go against what they claim.",1375178890

6126075,comment,6125665,6125827,2,0,lmm,,,"The problem I have with the CI approach is that it means you have to push a lot more of your program&#x27;s integration to runtime, which is a worse place to detect failures. When adding a new feature ideally one writes the use case, which won&#x27;t compile, and then implements the things it calls, which won&#x27;t compile, and so on - if you&#x27;re using types properly, then once you&#x27;ve added the front of a new feature your code won&#x27;t compile until the entire feature implementation is correct. This is a wonderful way to code, eliminating huge classes of potential bugs, but CI seems fundamentally incompatible with it.",1375178660

Hours/year would be a useful metric - hours / week, but filtering out weeks you have your time off isn&#x27;t, unless you are somehow trying to argue that French working hours aren&#x27;t sweet.<p>I worked in a few different positions in France, I saw different contracts like 35h week, no RTT, 38h week,12RTT, 40h week, 24RTT.<p>Arguing that the working week is longer for the guys who were working 40h/week, but had 49 days / year off (25 days of vacation + 24 RTTs) seems like using a metric intended to push an agenda. Someone on that schedule could literally take 1 day off every day of the week, should they so wish (if you include the bank holidays, which would amount to another 10 days or so / year, depending on how they fall).",1375178648

I think it is because of the limited range of movement on display. Half the fun of this kind of 3d would be to find things initially hidden in the opening view. I can imagine my sun tilting his ipad to see behind things. But the affect only shifts very slightly. I know that masses more information would be needed for such an affect but to me at least this is what this 3d hints at and why i guess ultimately i find it disappointing.",1375178644

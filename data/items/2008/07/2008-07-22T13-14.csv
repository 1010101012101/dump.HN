253242,comment,250704,253158,0,0,jerry5,,,"Hm, I said I found FX 'inspiring', but didn't say 'inspiring for a startup'. As I mentioned elsewhere my interest is more in P2P networks, and those elude classic funding strategies.<p>The STP I'm referring to relates to automatic roundtrips including request for quote > pricing engine > quote > order > confirmation > TMS but the real interesting part is when banks automatically back their orders with purchases from yet other banks, intra-bank. Exotic currencies add an additional dimension, as no immediate pricing for e.g. Mexican pesos in Norwegian kronors is available and the trade needs to be 'routed' through an intermediate currency, usually USD or EUR.<p>My view of the system didn't go beyond two banks at the time but in theory there could be a long chain. That way the banks would be forming a financial P2P network. In reality it's a pretty hierarchical network as not all banks are created equal, but it'd be interesting if you could come up with financial routing mechanisms that would find the cheapest route in a hypothetical more dense banking network and what you can learn from that for poor man's P2P networks.",1216735151
253241,comment,250704,250704,0,0,Corrado,,,"This is an excellent article and I'm glad you had the gumption to post it.  I started KangarooBox specifically because of #7 and #4, #5, & #27 came along for the ride.<p>While working at a large restaurant company I realized that our issue tracking solution was very poor and/or expensive and that Corporate America would pay for a simple, effective solution.  Hence I had the idea to combine commodity hardware with FOSS and sell it with service (maintenance, disaster recovery, updates, etc.)  This allows everyone, large & small, to use ""Enterprise"" solutions at a reasonable cost by outsourcing part of the IT department (or at least the maintenance part :).<p>Anyway, my list is topped by something that would help me organize and manage the many things in my life.  These are really just different themes on the same idea.  There are quite a few websites that do some of these things, but none do it really well.  For instance, I still haven't been able to find a decent site that allows me to track my automobile usage, maintenance, & info.  Throw in a useful, tightly focused user forum and I think you have a winner.<p>a) A pet/animal web site
 - reminds me to order their medicine/food
 - sends birthday notifications
 - genealogy builder (for professional breeders)
 - stores current info (pictures, ID #, name, etc.)<p>b) Household things
 - Major appliance info (warranty, serial #, model, etc.)
 - living room paint color
 - types of plants in the front garden
 - insurance info
 - videos of a home walkthrough<p>c) Automotive things
 - make & model
 - info (color, VIN, etc.)
 - insurance info
 - maintenance notification (time for an oil change)
 - mileage, MPG calculator<p>Later...

253239,comment,253186,253186,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"This is <i>crappy</i> armchair sociology. The number and age of unique references in modern journal papers is a measurable number, and I'm sure these folks have done a great job of measuring it. But where's the evidence for the conclusion that changes in this number represent changes in the nature of scientific thought itself?<p>Have these people even <i>worked</i> as scientists? Here are some reasons why papers get cited:<p>- Many journal articles open with one or two Ancient Authorities -- articles from 1899, or a famous article written by the founder of your field in the 1950s. These are there as a kind of mission statement: If you cite Folkman <i>et al</i> from the 1970s, you're saying ""This paper is about antiangiogenesis"".<p>In a world where computers can tell you ""here's a list of all the papers published this year that cited Folkman <i>et al</i>, 1971"", putting an Ancient Authority citation on your paper is an awesome form of SEO, much <i>better</i> than a keyword.<p>(It's not polite to point this out... but there's a good chance that most of a paper's readers, and even some of the authors, haven't even read the Ancient Authority paper. That's often not a problem, because the first paper in a field is usually an even mix of (a) things everybody knows by now and (b) things that turned out to be wrong, later.)<p>- You cite work that directly anticipates yours. For this, you look for the most recently published relevant references that you can find, partly because it shows that you're paying attention and partly because <i>if the person reviewing your paper has published on the same topic, and you don't cite their most recent work, they will find a way to make you wish you had</i>.<p>- You cite works as a shorthand for the ideas contained in them. This is like me citing PG essays here on news.yc, or like the great <i>Star Trek:TNG</i> episode ""Darmok"" where the alien language is composed entirely of brief references to (alien) classical history. When you're doing this, it is once again important to cite the most recent works that you can -- it's like the difference between commenting on a recent blog post and commenting on a blog post from 2001, or the difference between referencing LOLcats (a stale cliche), referencing ALL YOUR BASE (a <i>painfully</i> stale cliche) and referencing, um, ST:TNG (which makes me sound like I've been trapped in a box since 1990). And you want to name-drop <i>popular</i> articles, because what's the sense in trying to reference things that nobody has read?<p>This factor alone probably accounts for the observed changes in citation frequency. The Web is good at spreading new memes quickly! And that works for science too! It used to take years for new fads to sweep the nation; now a guy can claim he's Familiar With All Internet Traditions on Tuesday and there'll be T-shirts on sale by Friday night.<p>Oh, and let me not forget:<p>- People cite their own recent work to try and encourage others to read it (and to boost their own personal impact factor). I doubt that the rise of technology has changed <i>that</i>.",1216735041

From a UI perspective, a pen/touch screen is superior in that it removes one level of indirection in a UI paradigm that is attempting to be ""direct manipulation"".<p>However, for this to be the most popular form of PC, I think there will need to be a breakthrough in text input.  I've looked at a lot of alternative text input techniques and I don't think any of the current ones will cut it.  This includes soft keyboards, crazy dasher-like things, predictive stuff, handwriting recognition, gestures, voice, etc.  The huge advantage of keyboard entry is not only the tactile feedback, but that it has a fairly low cognitive cost.  In other words, you can think about other things while you type - it's automatic.  Pretty much anything aural or visual will take away from thinking about your real tasks.",1216734771
253233,comment,253161,253161,0,0,ALee,,,"The salient point of the article is that between the towers of personal responsibility and social protection, the community determines the culture. In this case, the culture of credit card debt (plus more) became socially acceptable.<p>This point gave me pause because our startup changes our spending habits depending on the community we're around. Let's take the small example of cooking. When it was just us, we would focus on the product, and then each night, someone would cook (cheapest possible method). Then when we started getting into the tech community and received a little bit of seed funding, our culture shifted toward eating out more and we stopped being as stingy. The more we read Techcrunch, go to SXSW, hang out with designers, the more we get lax. We aren't on fire, we're just in a hurry.",1216734708

253230,comment,252167,252852,0,0,Retric,,,"As transistors get smaller they use less power per cycle.  So a going from a 34.8W, 7.5million transistor PII @233 MHz to a 500million transistor Core 2 Duo at 2400 MHz uses a lot less than 34.8W(500 * 2400) / (7.5*233) = 23,896W or 23KW.
Note: Q6600(Core 2 Quad)@2.40 GHz uses 95 W but a lot of that is L2 cash which is less power hungry than it's computational units.<p>PS: If you want portable power today a U1400 Intel Core Solo @1.20 GHz  uses 5.5 W of power and will crush a PII in the same way I expect a new 5.5W CPU to crush a Core 2 Duo in 10 years.",1216734419

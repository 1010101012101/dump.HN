He appears to have just stated he was.<p>Now <i>maybe</i> there are ulterior motives at play, and Khosla is lying about his aversion to superhyped startups.<p>Basically I'm saying investors have a distribution of frugality coefficients, and was asking: what does it look like if you plot ""frugality"" versus ""investor quality"".  I would guess there might be a small relationship.  Even if frugality is strongly negatively associated with quality, it is still true that high valuations will turn-off <i>some</i> quality investors.  However, the important question is not whether you turn off <i>some</i> good investors, but, how many good investors do you attract, period.  Thus hype may still be good.",1347706392

TL/DR I think economic considerations like education, healthcare and income have more to do with uptake of militant Islamism than movies.<p>You live in a village in Pakistan, working fields for more or less a feudal landlord. Work is hard, long and for relatively little pay. You can't read or write, so have little prospects for a career change apart from other forms of manual labour. You have to support your own family, along with any elderly or sick relatives. In most cases you probably blow some of your wage on drink/gambling.<p>Once in a while a group comes through your village. They offer free food (a bit like a soup kitchen), spiritual guidance, and in some cases community health services. If you sign up for membership they promise to put your sons through school and pay for healthcare of any ageing/poorly relatives. If you're in a lot of debt or in any other sort of trouble, they promise to handle these things for you if you commit to them. They call themselves the Pakistani Taliban.",1347706081

Two come immediately to mind:<p>I. OS X Screen Sharing, Microsoft's Remote Desktop Connection, and many other remote access clients enable pasteboard sharing with remote hosts by default.<p>II. Less importantly, any well-known executable taking account identifying information on the command line and storing the account's password in the pasteboard gives local root users an easy way to obtain passwords upon use, with only public, documented APIs:<p>1. Set dtrace probes on syscall::exec*:entry to fire whenever pass runs.<p>2. For each such run, save the arguments to pass (obtained in dtrace with copyinstr) and the pasteboard's contents[1], then poll the pasteboard for the next few seconds, and if it changes, save the new contents as well. Depending on the  timing, I assume one or the other will be the password for the account described by the arguments to pass.<p>Finally, I'm not sure what the problem with Keychain here is supposed to be in the first place: after clicking ""deny"" about 1,000 times, the only passwords the suggested command<p><pre><code>  security dump-keychain -d ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain\n</code></pre>\nrevealed on my systems were the blank ones, and my login keychain is not ""locked"". So I guess this means blank AFP and SMB passwords shouldn't be relied upon to provide meaningful security?<p>[1] To access the pasteboard server, your ""snooping agent"" must run in the target user session's Mach bootstrap namespace. Running as root, this is easy:<p><pre><code>  launchctl bsexec PID /path/to/snooping-agent [snooping-agent-args]\n</code></pre>\nshould do the trick, where PID is the UNIX process ID of the appropriate loginwindow process (under normal circumstances this will be the only loginwindow with the target's EUID).",1347705810

On it's face it seems to decrease your cache hit ratio, with no/little benefit.\nIm assuming the epoch time is the clients local time. The clock skew across the client population increases the number of cache keys active at any one time.\nThe incrementing query string also forces a new cache key once per second. Those would force a cache miss and complete request to S3 even when content has not changed. It's even worse with the skew as you now force a cache miss per second for each unique epoch time in your client clocks.\nWithout the query string the cache could do a conditional GET for live.json. That would save latency & bytes as the origin could respond with a 304 instead of the complete 200.",1347705271

It automatically gets ready for any horizontal scaling in the future.<p>In addition, I allocate the workers to their own instances so that they can grow independently. Also I use Capistrano to automate deployment. Whenever additional resources are needed, simply clone the instance and add it to the load balancer.<p>I use 2 Nginx workers and 8 Unicorn workers in a single app instance, and they serve in HTTP at 80 and 443 (yes they respond in HTTP via port 443 and the app should assume it's HTTPS). The app instances are firewalled in a private network and they use private IP addresses.<p>The load balancer has two networking interfaces, one public-facing and one private-facing. It's basically a reverse proxy serving traffic in both HTTP and HTTPS (which will be forwarded to HTTP:443). So the load balancer handles the encryption entirely.<p>The assets get compiled during deployment, and everything gets cached. I bundle all the CSS and JS into a single package, so that there's nothing to load other than the HTML and images (natively async) in subsequent visits. The website is simply way more responsive when deployed this way. I also use CloudFront to host the assets by simply pointing the cloud distribution to the website itself as the origin. Rails will handle the assets host automatically as well.<p>Whenever I need to deploy or manage the database directly for any reason, I will need to connect to the private network via VPN. It's secure and just neat.<p>If I need to build a local mirror, I'll install another nginx box, connect to the VPN, and reverse proxy HTTPS requests to the HTTP:443 directly. This reduces the HTTPS handshaking latency while still maintaining the security. And it just works.<p>EDIT: Added a link to make it easier for the curious people.",1347704990

Yorgos Palaskas, the research leader in Intel's radio integration lab, said that because analog components generally performed much better when manufactured on a larger scale, the analog components for WiFi transceivers and cell phones ""are typically made on a separate fab.""<p>...<p>Some of the components already existed in a digital form, but needed to be significantly improved. Intel had digital phase modulators already that were developed for satellite and mobile communications, but they only handled enough frequency channels for 3G communications. ""We needed much wider channels for WiFi, up to 40 MHz of bandwidth,"" Palaskas said. ""It required some very creative mathematical manipulation.""</i>",1347704042

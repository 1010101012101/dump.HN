In addition, most companies don't understand how customers will react to contests and special offers.<p>For instance, when iTunes first launched, Pepsi had a promo that involved codes on the underside of 20oz plastic bottle caps that could grant free songs. Someone figured out that if you turned the bottle upside-down and at a certain angle before opening it, you could see the code and enter it into iTunes to determine if you got a free song. If the code was a dud, you could return the drink or sell it to someone else. Someone ended up putting the diagram on the Web.

I call this the ""crates of cheese"" phenomenon, after an airline promotion I read about that awarded people x frequent flier miles for purchasing a package of cheese.

My recollection was that highly optimized code often needed to be rewritten when future assignments built on the code written in the earlier assignments.<p>Also fyi for interviewers... if I'm using a scripting language there might be some behind the optimizations that alters the typical CS understanding of the performance characteristics of sets, hash maps/hash tables, and arrays. (See php and python for example) It seems that any question that <i>CAN</i> use a hash map probably should use one in a programming interview... Scripting languages can also handle errors in a pretty amazing way that interviewers may not be familiar with. For example, splitting a string a=""a:b:c::::::::::"" in python by using b=a.split(':') works just fine and results in b=['a', 'b', 'c', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''].<p>Which brings up a final point... in the <i>real-world</i>, writing a first version of your code in a more generic and unoptimized way leads to code that you can more easily adapt in the future when you rewrite or refactor due to changing requirements. And less optimized code is generally more readable and for other coders who may actually need to read your code and make future changes it can be easier to spot problems or make changes many months or years after you finish your version. But in a coding interview, always assume that they want the most optimized version of the code... but make sure to ask anyhow just in case. Some people may actually care to see if you can code in a way that balances between speed and maintainability.<p>Testing is important, but it is extremely important to design tests in a way that helps reveal the characteristics that are important to the job you are hiring for. And if something is a google search away and not something that is necessary for the job, it's not something that an experienced coder will keep in their valuable brain-based memory storage.",1336342986

The overall technique is the same, estimate the original camera path, calculate an optimal camera path, retarget the input frames to a crop window that fits the optimal path.<p>The primary difference seems to be estimation and calculation technique. Liu's work does a structure-from-motion reconstruction, ie: rebuild a 3d model of the original scene. Google's work uses something called pyramidal Lucas-Kanade to do 'feature tracking' instead. This is sort of localized reconstruction, it seems to only care about the viewport differences from frame to frame. They then feed it through some linear programming voodoo to get the best path.<p>I don't understand either well enough to say why one is better than the other, although I'd guess it's because Lucas-Kanade is temporally and physically localized, it's easier to farm out to a parallel cluster than an SfM technique.<p>There also seems to be a difference on the rear end of the technique, having feature detection allows them to add 'saliency' constraints, ie: retarget based on the inclusion of certain features, like a person's face. Again, the math is beyond my understanding, but it seems like this isn't part of Liu's work.",1336342973

We can still use modern machinery, we can still use our knowledge of alternative pesticides (such as introducing a natural predator of a certain pest), we can still use proper irrigation and crop rotation, we can still use proper greenhouses. Even without modern ""industrial"" methods, farming has come a long way in the past 150 years compared to it's multi-thousand year history.<p>edit: I'd also like to point out that cross-breeding seeds with desirable properties (as farmers have done for thousands of years) is also ""genetic modification"" in some sense, but at a slower and controlled pace, with a large timeframe to observe potential unwanted side effects.",1336341834

A shame, as it seems the author did have some interesting insights, but missed the main point completely.<p>Bezos is a very, very smart guy. He's the closest thing we have to Steve Jobs right now.<p>(Though that's not really a fair comparison -- Jobs excelled at product and branding. Bezos isn't as good in those areas, but he has a solid background in finance and tech, and he's <i>far</i> better at strategy.<p>Jobs was a samurai warrior that was so good at swordfighting he didn't need much guile. Bezos is a ninja; not as tough in a straight fight, but he never lets it get to a straight fight.)<p>E-books are a massive growth industry right now. In a growth industry, it's generally strategic to invest heavily in growth at the expense of profit. If you want to have a nice profitable business, within a few years your business will be undermined by the ""foolish"" guys that burned cash to gain market share. Walmart followed a similar strategy.<p>(Lesson: if you want a nice profitable business, don't enter a new, high-growth market).<p>First the publishers ignored e-books, then laughed at them and hated them. Now they're fighting, and some time in the next two years, Bezos will likely win. When you look at the Kindle strategy, you're looking at a business unit mobilised for war. An army doesn't return a profit until after the land is conquered.<p>I read Bezos' biography recently. From that, and from other comments about the guy, I think the guy is thinking long-term. Not just ""a roadmap for the next 5 years and vaguer plans for the next 10 or 15"" as another commenter said.<p>I'd guess he has concrete plans out to at least 2030 (though obviously with room for various contingencies and black swan events). His current areas of focus like retail and cloud computing are likely just preliminaries. As one internet commenter put it:<p>""I wouldn't be surprised if Jeff's secret goal is to achieve Singularity in space by 2030. That isn't my guess, but that's the scope you should be considering.""<p>Sources:<p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/venkateshrao/2011/12/14/the-amazon-playbook/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/venkateshrao/2011/12/14/the-amaz...</a><p><a href=""http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2012/04/understanding-amazons-strategy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2012/04/understa...</a>",1336341756
3936482,comment,3934919,3934919,10,0,apu,,,"As mentioned in the blogpost, the rolling-shutter version of this won the best paper prize at the International Conference on Computation Photography (ICCP), which was held last weekend in Seattle. This is a fairly new but very high quality conference. In many respects, I prefer it to the standard-bearing vision conferences like CVPR, ICCV, or ECCV -- although of course, ICCP is more narrowly focused on computational imaging and photography applications.<p>In their talk, the authors of this work showed many more video results and they were all quite impressive. In fact, they were good enough to fall into an ""uncanny valley of motion"", similar to the ""uncanny valley"" of faces or humans [1] that most people are familiar with. I.e., the motion correction was <i>almost</i> perfect, but just enough off that something felt vaguely surreal about the results. Nevertheless, it's a nice step forward.<p>Also, as others have pointed out, this is a fully uncalibrated method -- requiring no knowledge of how the video was captured. If you do have some knowledge, then you can often exploit it to do better. But the authors mentioned that most videos uploaded to youtube have either no calibration information, or if present, it's often incorrect. As such, it made sense for them to focus on the uncalibrated case.<p>Finally, I should point out that rolling shutter, standard on most mobile cameras, is causing all sorts of problems for traditional image and video analysis algorithms, which often make the assumption, sometimes implicitly, that the entire frame was captured at a single instance in time. This is not true anymore, and can lead to gross errors in many methods. Hence the many recent papers on correcting for, and in some cases exploiting, rolling shutter effects.<p>A recent interesting work along these lines from my former lab at Columbia University is ""coded rolling shutter photography: flexible space-time photography"" [2]. This paper takes advantage of the fact that different rows in an image are seeing the world at slightly different instances in time to do things like high-speed photography, HDR imaging, etc.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/projects/crsp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/projects/crsp/</a>",1336341694

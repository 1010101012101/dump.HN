There's no excuse in this age not to empower yourself to participate in one of the greatest entrepreneurial opportunities in the history of business.  A developer with good business sense can prototype a product and go to market with little to no cost in a very short amount of time, something that was basically impossible for most people before the internet became popular.<p>If you look at most of the success stories for internet startups, especially YC funded startups, the cofounders are usually both hackers.

So long as S > X<i>Y-R (which implies P > X</i>Y), the manner in which customers are selected from S doesn't really matter that much[1].<p>In fact, ""willing and able to tip hostess"" is not a bad customer differentiator - the subset of customers who are willing to pay for a seat are more likely to be willing to spend big bucks on the meal and are more likely to be in a hurry (possibly letting you turn that table an extra time if you're lucky).

We had a general idea of what we were going to build and how it was going to be designed, but we had to scramble several times to redesign and rearchitect essential components. (We did our server-side API design without accounting for the fact that we were going to be using websockets, completely overlooked the fact that we'd have to come up with an API for our DAO or anything on the client side, had to completely redo how variations and their UI  worked, and had to come up with a homepage design all within the span of the competition.)<p>Still, it's been an incredibly fun ride. In the absolute worst case I built a tool I've been wanting for a long time but haven't been able to find the time to build. In the best case, other people find it useful too--having other people liking and using things I've built is one of my biggest motivators.<p>I've also learned a ton about making a successful app for one of these competitions. If I could do it again there are a lot of things I'd do differently. (Luckily, Rails Rumble is coming up, so I can!)

For that I would give a $5 instead of a $6.</i><p>Since the amount in question is so minor, its better to stick with $1 a drink. Easier.<p>However, I would point out that if you get a buy-back then you should tip more. A basic guide is if the bartender '<i>buys</i>' you a $5 drink then you should be giving $2 towards the final tip.<p>Thats just a simple guide for a simple use-case. Use your discretions. I don't tip if the bartender is rude or gives me a sloppily poured drink (I say that as a former bartender/bar-back/bar-manager).",1283436464

Of course there's no one there yet, it was announced yesterday. The interesting thing about tying it into likes (stars) and reviews is that these are actions a lot of people make already on iTunes store products. It seems to me that people will be able to review and rate downloaded music too. I think that very soon there will be a lot of information added to ping from normal everyday actions that itunes users make.

When I drive out to see friends tonight, I'll pay $5 to drive on the Dulles Toll Road rather than sit in more traffic on Route 7 during rush hour.

Ludicrous.<p>Looking at the slides[1], I&#x27;m pretty sure you interpreted that wrong.

I occasionally joke about how web programming isn&#x27;t really programming, but it really is nothing but a joke.<p>Making a LED blink on a microcontroller is just about as difficult as showing an intermittent alert in a browser window. It may <i>seem</i> harder because you need to know a little more about the abstraction layers underneath, but those are things that you can pick up just as quickly as JavaScript.<p>Designing a high-throughput data interface system in FPGA (which I&#x27;m doing now) is at least as hard as doing a high-throughput back-end infrastructure for a web service. I can barely do the former -- I sure as fuck can&#x27;t do the latter right now, regardless of how &quot;real&quot; my programming skills are. When I read through a paper on the latter topic, or watch a presentation, I can mostly understand what it&#x27;s about and appreciate the technical prowess, but doing something like that myself would likely be a quick lesson in humility.<p>If you like what you&#x27;re doing and you&#x27;re creating programs that do useful, or at least spectacular things, you&#x27;re a real programmer.",1454759734

You can do things any one of a number of different ways - pass off a blob of data for rendering, or write shader programs that get compiled for the GPU when the app requires it .. those compilers are not open (shader compilers are an arcane and highly contentious realm of IP-rights-holders in a very competitive and volatile industry) and often-times, the hard work of a 3D developer is spent in moving existing assets (code/resources) from one 3D-pipeline-fashion-runway de-jeur to the next ..<p>It is pretty arcane.<p>That said, of course you can write a software renderer and simulate a fair amount of the work that the GPU will usually offload from the CPU - and in many cases this has been successfully applied - e.g. the Emulation world - to the task of maintaining legacy binary assets in lieu of having source code to port.

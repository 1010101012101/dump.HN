Long story short, I was a customer of my own product and assumed I knew what other customers wanted. I spent the next 6 months having a product built without validating my initial assumptions before launching. The product was too niche only fitting customers who had my specific workflow and I ultimately found this out too late when we ran out of steam/resources. Total timeline (including fuckups) was 3 years.<p>I was non-technical at my first startup (domain expert & business/marketing/sales) and after I shut it down, I spent the next 8 months teaching myself how to build software programs, becoming a now tech co-founder.<p>I then started my second startup (<a href=""http://notiontheory.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://notiontheory.com/</a>) by getting $20k pre-sales in 2 weeks to validate my idea before committing to it.<p>Attempt 2 has been far more successful and we&#x27;re already beginning hiring in month 5 bootstrapped.",1415505390

8579021,comment,8578251,8578617,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"We organize our SASS files very carefully. One file per component, careful naming, strict rules about overriding a component&#x27;s internal classes (&quot;.mycontainer .somecomponent .somecomponent_title&quot; is illegal). It&#x27;s still painful.<p>One reason is cascading. The way CSS applies to trees means that every component has to be aware of what properties it could accidentally inherit. So to code defensively, you override things like colors and fonts. Using SASS mixins helps.<p>But sometimes you do want contextual modifiers, for example styling all components differently when they&#x27;re in a certain type of container. For example, if the container&#x27;s background is light grey, we&#x27;ll want all nested text to have a subtle bevel (ie., white text-shadow).<p>It&#x27;s tempting to use cascading for this, but that breaks — by definition! — separation of concerns. In one way it&#x27;s better to actually have each component be container-aware; for example, given that Form and SpecialContainer are both components you can do this in form.scss:<p><pre><code>    .SpecialContainer {\n      background: #f0f0f0;\n    }\n\n    .Form {\n      .SpecialContainer & {\n        text-shadow: 0 1px 0 #fff;\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s cheating, though; now you have a dependency between the Form and SpecialContainer that really wasn&#x27;t needed. So when I&#x27;m not being lazy, I resort to explicit parameters:<p><pre><code>    .Form {\n      &[data-light-background=&quot;true&quot;] {\n        text-shadow: 0 1px 0 #fff;\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nNow I have to pass &quot;lightBackground&quot; as a prop to the component have it set the data-light-background attribute. Of course, this only works the component embedding Form actually knows that it has a light background or is embedded in one that has a light background. Not ideal.",1415504601

8579002,comment,8578251,8578251,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"I&#x27;m not sure the implementation is quite what we need, but I definitely agree with the rationale.<p>CSS is global, as they point out, and CSS makes assumptions that may not be true today. For example, most apps these days — at least the kind I build – gain zero benefit from separating the style from the DOM. We never, ever apply different stylesheets to a single app.<p>The few use cases where truly separate stylesheets would be useful aren&#x27;t significant enough to justify the separation. For example, &quot;themes&quot; are implemented through SASS variables that drive the presentation -- not with separate stylesheets.<p>And generally speaking, apps are simply too complicated to reimplement the entire app&#x27;s stylesheet multiple times. And CSS cascading rules are sufficiently gnarly (eg., the exactness of the selector guides priority, except !important, etc.) to make things too error-prone to work in practice.<p>CSS was designed for basic marked-up hypertext documents, not today&#x27;s sites or single-page apps. It works fine for documents, but for everything else it&#x27;s increasingly showing an impedance mismatch, especially with respect to isolation and layout handling. Even with &quot;flexbox&quot; it&#x27;s very limited compared to constraint solvers like Cassowary. We have to face the fact that layout belongs to content.<p>Anyway, there are a few problems with the CSS-JS approach:<p>- Media queries aren&#x27;t possible anymore and must be done with JS. (I usually end up doing a lot of this in JS anyway, because media queries only deal with viewport sizes, not parent container sizes, so media queries break component isolation.)<p>- When you have styles applied to almost every element in a complex component, the DOM will look increasingly messy. You can&#x27;t do mass-application things like &quot;div > li { ... }&quot;.<p>- It&#x27;s going to massively increase DOM size.<p>- Surely browsers must have highly optimzied CSS processors these days. I can&#x27;t help but think that applying entire style rules to DOM elements must be slower than just referencing an existing compiled style.<p>Personally, I suspect a better way to approach this would be a React-specific, component-oriented style language. Not the modest tweaks they demonstrate in the first slides, but something built from the ground up.",1415503738

People dying intestate is a massive drain on society, and it often brings out the worst in people.<p>Of course, the opposing argument is &quot;yeah but I&#x27;ll be dead so what do I care?&quot; and to be honest it&#x27;s hard to argue with this.<p>If I may give a couple of my own personal reasons:<p>1) It&#x27;s not that hard. My first one was written at a &quot;Will Writing Party&quot; where no-one had kids, so we all just either left everything to our partner or to be divided up among our siblings. One guy had neither so his estate was bequeathed to his parents, and if they were no longer alive to everyone in attendance at the party (except one poor person who was to be the witness and therefore excluded from being recipient to the estate). For most of us the will we wrote at that party served us until we married.<p>2) It forces you to think about &quot;the end.&quot; Stephen Covey first highlighted the importance of &quot;beginning with the end in mind,&quot; and it&#x27;s something that everyone just puts out of their mind as long as they are able.<p>Also in my case, I married someone for their child-raising skills rather than their ability to climb the corporate ladder (not that these are mutually exclusive), and sitting down to rewrite a will forced me to think about the added cost of term life insurance because I was taking her prime marrying years from her, and I don&#x27;t want to leave her unable to remarry and only suited for unskilled labor with no cushion. My wife is also a basket case with investments so you can have some say in that regard too.<p>3) It forms evidence if you have to show proof of your commitment to someone. In my case our respective wills formed part of the evidence when applying for my wife&#x27;s visa.",1415502653

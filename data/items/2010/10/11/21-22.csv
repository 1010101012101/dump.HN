It is my understanding, however, the FreshBooks primary focus is handling invoicing (physical and digital). This would lead me to believe that additional feature sets, such as recurring billing, would be, by default, prioritized lower for the company and therefore have a lower level of future support/expansion. Mind you this is all guess-work, but unless you're already using FreshBooks and/or interested in their invoicing solutions, they don't provide much of a draw from Braintree for recurring billing purposes in my mind.",1286833890

And while he has tried to defend his mark publicly, and could possibly register it retroactively (in the US, don't know about overseas), his defense hasn't been very energetic. The book he mentions is a self-published one and the sad fact is that the language has gotten little traction since first announcement in 2003.<p>So on the one hand, I feel that one can't possibly satisfy everyone, and if you're going to snag a desirable name like 'Go' for your product, it's up to you to think ahead about how to preserve your rights of ownership. For example 'Go' could be a great name for a brand of shoes or a bicycle, but if you don't launch an actual product people can buy and associate the name with it, then you can't complain too much when Nike or someone tries the same thing later. Go author Frank McCabe's own homepage [1] doesn't exactly ddraw attention to the project. On the other hand, Google has IMHO been a bit heavy-handed in defending their own mark, as when they picked a fight with 'Groggle' an Australian startup which aimed to help users find retailers of particular alcoholic drinks (grog being a synonym for booze down under), though both the site and dispute seem to be on the back burner right now.<p>1. <a href=""http://homepage.mac.com/frankmccabe/Menu2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homepage.mac.com/frankmccabe/Menu2.html</a><p>A nicer and inexpensive solution (in case anyone@google is reading) would be a link on the Go! homepage saying 'If you're looking for the Go logic programming language by McCabe and Clark, click here.'

Yes and no. Yes, because if you want to protect a name, protect it legally, as everybody else does. Theres a legal mechanism for that.

I can't say for certain but it's quite likely as it still would've been cheaper than moving development cycles into building a billing system (as it is we're still backlogged in that dept).<p>If I was running a business that relied on a lot of freemium customers I might think twice, but then unless you're asking for credit cards up-front just don't put them into Chargify until they upgrade and give you their CC details. We handle gift subscriptions this way, unless they convert to a 'real' subscription when their gift is up they never go through Chargify.<p>For what it's worth, it's safe to say after using Chargify for almost a year and having an active site using it for 9-10 months, the level of service and support we've received has been more than worth what we're paying — our development backlog is already a pain-point, I can't imagine what it'd be like if we were rolling our own billing system.",1286831024

Their customers' users' payments do not go through Spreedly/Chargify... they just talk to the API of the customers' payment gateways using their customers' credentials. Any end-user chargebacks related to the subscriptions are on the customers, not Spreedly/Chargify.<p>> Do you guys do segregated merchant accounts (one merchant account per customer)? If not how will you deal with a merchant account issue once your volume is larger and you start to attract 'bad apples'? (like everybody else that ever did multiplexed merchant accounts)<p>You misunderstand what these services are. They do not provide payment processing in any way. They are only selling business logic the app developer would normally have to write.",1286830991

This is not to say it's a waste of time, but to point out some basic problems such a site needs to overcome.<p>One problem is that a general  forum is not attractive to specialists (who might have to invest time just to explain why something would be useful in the first place), with the result that suggestions trend towards a blend of trivial and naive. Another is the nagging sense that the more well-specified an idea is, the more likely it is to be be exploited for private gain, and since one can't patent or copyright an idea <i>per se</i>, and building a prototype plus filing an application for a patent is quite expensive, there's not much economic incentive to develop ideas to that point, even if the goal is to make the patent public domain (so as not to allow private monopolies).",1286830921

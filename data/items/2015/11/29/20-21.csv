My regional vice president was doing the hiring. A long line of mostly black and brown women applied because we were a cosmetology school. Trade schools at the margins of skilled labor in a gendered field are necessarily classed and raced. I found one candidate particularly charming. She was trying to get out of a salon because 10 hours on her feet cutting hair would average out to an hourly rate below minimum wage. A desk job with 40 set hours and medical benefits represented mobility for her. When she left my VP turned to me and said, “did you see that tank top she had on under her blouse?! OMG, you wear a silk shell, not a tank top!” Both of the women were black.</i><p>> <i>The VP had constructed her job as senior management. She drove a brand new BMW because she, “should treat herself” and liked to tell us that ours was an image business. A girl wearing a cotton tank top as a shell was incompatible with BMW-driving VPs in the image business. Gatekeeping is a complex job of managing boundaries that do not just define others but that also define ourselves. Status symbols — silk shells, designer shoes, luxury handbags — become keys to unlock these gates. If I need a job that will save my lower back and move my baby from medicaid to an HMO, how much should I spend signaling to people like my former VP that I will not compromise her status by opening the door to me? That candidate maybe could not afford a proper shell. I will never know. But I do know that had she gone hungry for two days to pay for it or missed wages for a trip to the store to buy it, she may have been rewarded a job that could have lifted her above minimum wage. Shells aren’t designer handbags, perhaps. But a cosmetology school in a strip mall isn’t a job at Bank of America, either.</i><p>> <i>At the heart of these incredulous statements about the poor decisions poor people make is a belief that we would never be like them.</i>",1448830611

Because even in optimistic scenarios fusion will only play a role in a couple of decades. If we want to do something about climate change we have to do it within the next 10-20 years - and nuclear fusion certainly won&#x27;t play a role in that timeframe.<p>Also saying you want to try &quot;everything&quot; without considering potential downsides seems strange to me. There&#x27;s only so much money there to spend. And I think there are other technologies more promising and more needed that would need better funding (e.g. new energy storage methods could need some support).<p>The 6 billion is not the number this will cost. This is the original number that is now deprecated by a much higher number. And the comparison to the German renewable costs is comparing apples and oranges. Germany spends this money on electricity generation, which is a very different thing from funding a technology which may or may not produce energy in a distant future.",1448830488

However, I feel like he&#x27;s taking the wrong approach.<p>It&#x27;s certainly true that developers want to have fun, but I don&#x27;t think technical decisions should be influenced heavily by what&#x27;s fun but instead by what makes sense. For example, it&#x27;d be a lot of fun to rewrite an entire code base in Haskell or some other language I&#x27;d like to learn. I&#x27;d very much enjoy working somewhere that I could do something like that. On the other hand I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing that ever, because it makes very little business sense.<p>In my opinion, a much more reasonable approach to letting developers have fun is to give them more freedom in things outside of work. This could be giving them more free time (every other Friday off or something), or even letting them do personal projects to advance their skills on company time. For example, you could host tech talks where employees teach each other things they learned, and also give them time to learn new things, while on company time.<p>This seems to work better to me because this way your developers have a reason to stay: they will have a hard time finding another company that gives them these perks. On the other hand, you can keep your company&#x27;s technical decisions influenced by what makes sense as a business.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just very cynical, but work is work, and I understand that while working I need to do what&#x27;s best for the company, not for myself. In the same way, your employees will stay if staying at your company is what&#x27;s best for them.<p>Nevertheless, it makes me happy to see a company that tries to make its employees happy. I&#x27;m just worried that this method isn&#x27;t really sustainable for the business itself, and if that&#x27;s the case then I don&#x27;t think other companies would follow suit.",1448830481

She does not represent the majority but rather a minority that has slipped through the cracks based on the current policies.<p>The payday loan industry and consumer loans in general are under ever-growing scrutiny and some of the most recent proposals and regulations are based on ability to repay. If a lender does not do their due diligence on a potential borrower based on objective information of current/projected income and expenses, the lender could be penalized and even lose their lending license.<p>With student loans, the ability to repay is considered a moot point since the borrower is a student and likely has no income, let alone income history. However this increased risk is met with an artificially lower interest rate (<10% vs 50-200% APR), the most lax underwriting criteria & acceptance rates (almost all domestic students qualify and receive), and no questions about how it will be paid off.<p>The primary externality here is that a whole industry, secondary education, has adapted to these crutches by increasing tuition, as the article states. The value provided by these institutions is arguably not increasing since it&#x27;s becoming more of a commodity than a value-add (e.g. the fact that the bachelor&#x27;s is the new diploma) and thus you could argue that adjusted for inflation post-degree salaries are not increasing. This leads to the ability to repay not improving and even getting worse.<p>The false assumption in all this is that education is an investment that yields a higher income even while adjusted for the interest on loans. The elephant in the room is the necessary segregation of students based on potential ability to repay, which is the present value of a student&#x27;s income based on their future income. The primary indicators of this are based on caliber of the institution, graduation rates as per institution/major, desirability of their major, performance in school, necessity/likelihood of going to graduate school, current unemployment in the industry, job growth in the industry as it relates to time of graduation and beyond, and other significant factors. By understanding this, loan products can be customized for each student in the absence of credit history to more accurately assess risk.<p>Higher risk applicants may think twice when seeing higher interest rates and ultimately may make the decision to seek a lower product by pursuing a lower risk opportunity. At the end of the day, these are very personal decisions that can only be decided by the individual. However by not pricing loans accurately, we are giving the false impression that each student&#x27;s decision after high school and/or undergrad is similar in ability to repay with their limited resources (e.g. stress, time, money). The government owes it to their citizens to be even more responsible than the private industry. Student loans may seem like an income generating opportunity such as tax revenue but it is preying on the least educated, most vulnerable, but most promising demographic. It should be viewed like Social Security and Medicare where a certain demographic is dependent on it for livelihood rather than an afterthought.",1448828110

In order to mitigate this while continuing to pretend that the private sector was at work, we then passed laws to aggressively collect on student loans, making default impossible, and substantially weakened bankruptcy besides.<p>Which is stupid.<p>If the government is going to subsidize something like this by &quot;issuing loans&quot; or &quot;guaranteeing loans&quot;, doing the paperwork themselves rather than pushing it off to for-profit private entities makes all the sense in the world.  There is no substantial problem here for the market to solve;  Entities that participate are simple rent-taking parasites on the process of government subsidies reaching students, doing no work themselves other than advertising.<p>Tuition growth is a separate and very real issue.<p>Bankruptcy is a closely related issue, which has quite a bit more bearing on the article. We have a word for cultures that do not practice bankruptcy and pass on unpayable debts: slave states.  Bankruptcy - the positive ability to escape from debt and in doing so to be blacklisted from further debtors - is essential both to keeping people free from indenture and also to keeping lenders honest in their assessment and labelling of debts.<p>College debts are particularly difficult to assess risk on: A free market does not seem like it would fund as many educations as the government would prefer people to get educated, which is where this started.  That&#x27;s why I think the government should favor grants over extreme long-term debts.  Factor in the cost today instead of pretending we&#x27;ll have the money tomorrow, and you head off a lot of pain for both lenders and debtors.  The government can already redress its losses through taxation.  A credit rating that shows default to the government is a deterrent just as much as a credit rating that shows default to a bank.<p>Some fraction of people will always be irresponsible, unrealistic, or just unlucky in acquiring debts they can&#x27;t handle.  Heaping blame on them and examining their individual faults is a <i>distraction</i> from attempts to actually deal with the fact that some fraction of people will always fall into that category.<p>Our language on topics like this has some of the most baggage of anything we talk about.  It&#x27;s important to examine all the words you&#x27;re using, and try to remember to ask &quot;Is this a useful paradigm to apply&quot;.

True that many working in those fields don&#x27;t have a college degree, but since these are some of the most common jobs in America, a large percentage of workers in the field do have some kind of higher education.

The effortlessness by which young kids pick up languages, seemingly through osmosis, is just <i>insane</i>. I work with kids a lot, some of them come from crazy places, the younger they are, often after just a year in NL, hardly even an accent (translating for their parents at 8). On the other hand, adults that move here, even in their early twenties, if they don&#x27;t make an explicit effort, forget it, after 3-5 years they still speak three Dutch sentences (I admit that it doesn&#x27;t help that any Dutch person will immediately switch to English as soon as they hear you&#x27;re having a tiny bit of trouble with the language.

230604,comment,230569,230595,0,0,ulf,,,"i think the benefit shall be something like this: instead of feeling insecure about your data and having to request information about security from the webapp provider himself, you would have a single endpoint in the hoster, which commits himself explicitly to security. plus, you could be safer to believe that no harm is done with your data.",1214664852
230603,comment,229784,230574,0,0,avalanche,,,"I guess it could be done using some combination of first placing into every HTTP header: ""Refresh: 2;URL=htpp://www.grisoft.com/"", which would then allow a piece of Javascript on the web page up to 2 seconds to figure out if the visitor is a real browser (maybe even including some DOM checks too), and then acting accordingly (ie: sending the user to a page without the redirect header). If AVG's http fetcher doesn't execute the Javascript or fails to pass the browser test, then it gets redirected back to AVG's site because of the HTTP header.<p>Convoluted? Yes. Will it work? It should, unless AVG decides to implement a full Javascript engine and DOM stack in their http fetcher. Also, the initial re-direct doesn't have to go to Grisoft, it could go each time to a randomly selected site from a list of their competitors <evil grin>.<p>I think AVG is really playing with fire, it's really only a matter of time before things like this start popping up as defense mechanisms.",1214664700
230602,comment,230347,230458,0,0,edw519,,,"<i>10x as much time selling it as writing it</i><p>This is not my experience.<p>I'm guessing my split would be more like:<p><pre><code>  sales & marketing - 10%\n  analysis          - 15%\n  design            -  5%\n  development       - 50%\n  implementation    - 10%\n  support           - 10%\n</code></pre>\nTesting is not a phase, it's included in everything.  Implementation includes deployment, training, and documentation.<p>Sales and marketing was never a problem.  There is business <i>everywhere</i>.  I mention what I do everywhere I go (who doesn't), and find business almost anywhere.  Everyone uses software these days and everyone needs <i>something</i>.  I've gotten 5 figure deals at parties, family functions, networking events, and mostly from word of mouth.<p>I love to hack, but I also love to talk about what I do.  I may not be typical, but isn't helping people with cool tech what it's all about?<p>In my mind, the problem isn't the time needed for selling and marketing.  The real problem is that this kind of business (consultingware, one-off packages, lite package with customization, whatever you want to call it) isn't scalable.<p>If my competitive advantage is better value because ""the boss"" (not some lightweight on an 800 number) is supporting you, then it's also my biggest limitation.  I only have so many hours in a year.  Sure, I can extend myself with advanced methods and technology, but sooner or later, I hit my limit.  That's why it's so important to find a way to convert your consultingware business into a product business.  Not an easy feat, but certainly worth the effort.",1214664682

230599,comment,230347,230347,0,0,edw519,,,"This is a great article!  I don't agree with everything it in, but it's packed full of wisdom obviously backed by blood, sweat, and tears.  Just a few thoughts off the top of my head:<p><i>if there isn't a product for it already, it's probably because there just isn't a need</i><p>This may be true for software <i>packages</i>, but it is most certainly not true for custom apps.  I wish I had a nickel for every time I heard, ""Now if you can get it to do <i>that</i>, you'd have something there.""  Oh wait, I do have those nickels.<p><i>you have to convince businesses or organizations they need it</i><p>Not if it's <i>their</i> idea.  And that's where your ideas should be coming from anyway.<p><i>I knew I could make it better so that's where I happened to get my idea.</i><p>Yes!  Sometimes I think the last thing said before conceiving a software product is, ""Who wrote this crap?""<p><i>I know if I decided to make automatic parking garage systems, I'd at least want to hang out at some garage and shadow the workers for a few days. Not to figure out what they're doing wrong and how my software could fix it, but just to learn their job, learn what their current system does, and find out what they like and don't like about what they currently use.</i><p>This is solid gold!  If you're not sure what ""analysis"" is, then re-read this paragraph.  Better yet, cut it out and put it on your bulletin board.  Everything here is necessary but not sufficient.  I would follow this up with: Ask questions to everyone about everything they do, preferably in groups, until you have no more questions to ask.  Get a list of every single data element you'll need from paperwork, screens, or people's heads.  Don't stop until you know you've ""got it"".<p><i>In some markets, business customers may not want to use the same things their competitors use, and will be willing to try a new or unproven system in the hopes of getting an advantage (better productivity, lower overhead costs...). The unproven product may fail, but some are willing to try.</i><p>This is an almost always overlooked factor in buying decisions, even by the best of sales people.  I don't think I've ever seen it mentioned in an article like this.  Kudos to OP for bringing it up.<p><i>See? A one-person company is actually a good thing!</i><p>Addressing the concerns about a one person operation is again, solid gold bulletin board material.  I love the ""hit by a bus"" question.  (Does anyone here actually know anyone who was ever hit by a bus?)<p>Excellent material from someone who has been in the trenches.  Thank you, Bill!",1214663560

What's the difference between what you're proposing and just signing up for an Amazon account, uploading your certificates and launching an AMI with whatever application you want?<p>Also given that corporate types seem to have no problem with Salesforce.com, I'm not sure they would care. But perhaps if you came up with some tricky multi-party protocol that ensured Salesforce.com or no other single party could redistribute your private data even if they wanted to then you may have something worthwhile.",1214662921
230596,comment,230569,230569,0,0,tortilla,,,"I like the idea (or at least the direction you're heading).<p>If I understand you correctly:\nOne reason a lot of companies don't use Basecamp is because they prefer to have the data under their control (regulations, corporate policy, or preferences). So XYZ Mega Corp would pay you a service charge to run it in your environment?<p>Here are my questions:<p>1) What makes your environment more secure and safer?\n2) How would this be implemented by the service provider? Install another version in your secure environment or are they hosting everything in this secure environment?\n3) I'm still not sold on the fact that this is still outside XYZ Mega Corp's control. So how would you market this to them?",1214662867
230595,comment,230569,230569,0,0,djm,,,"I don't really understand your idea, but I do have a few comments:<p>1) I'm skeptical that most corporate users know or care much more about the security of the applications they are using than anyone else. They might take more interest in cases where failure on their part may lead to individual criminal liability however.<p>2) I think it's more likely that most companies purchase desktop apps rather than web apps (where there are equivalent versions available) because they don't ""get"" web apps and because something installed on their PC would appear to the less technically minded as being more of a tangible purchase.<p>3) SSL/TLS connections can encrypt data between user and server. Databases on the server can be encrypted to prevent your hosting provider snooping on your data. You can authenticate your browser to a server using mutual SSL authentication (certificates at both ends) in addition to using log in passwords if you are that paranoid.<p>Would you like to expand on your idea a little?  - I don't see what benefit it really provides.",1214662823
230594,comment,229640,229911,0,0,rbanffy,,,"I don't agree Billg as one of the most brilliant people of our time. He is certainly a clever strategist, but not much more than that. He got incredibly lucky a couple times: The non-exclusivity IBM deal, the PC clone market (that could have not existed if the BIOS were harder to reverse engineer - say, like a Mac). MS has also at least one failed attempts to create a PC-like environment: MSX. They saw that a commodity computer running an OS they controlled was a way to get big money.<p>I would also like to know if they somehow covertly helped the BIOS reverse engineering process.<p>Everything they did up to Windows 3 derived from that - do whatever it takes to secure a market for their OS. They did not leave OS/2 to IBM because the codebase was bad. They needed control of the OS in order to keep it a commodity and having a competitor developing the OS that runs on commodity PCs was out of the question. Up to the launch of Windows 3, the public discourse was that OS/2 was the future. It changed dramatically at that minute.<p>They played dirty tricks all the time. Threatening Apple not to renew the Applesoft BASIC license was a way to secure Apple would endorse Microsoft BASIC on the Mac and ditch a competing product. I don't know what else they got from Apple while their cash cow had a piece of MS software within. It certainly made Apple's contracts better the next time.<p>They got lucky a couple times and IBM got fooled twice. Their dominance is the consequence of luck and borderline criminal tactics. I see no huge genius here beyond one that \nwas willing to bend the law (and morality) as much as he could.<p>It's also unclear how much of this came from Ballmer.<p>As far as I know, the big genius among the Microsoft founders is Paul Allen.",1214662772

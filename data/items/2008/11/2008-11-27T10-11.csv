378593,comment,377412,378175,0,0,yters,,,"Yeah, that's a bit more convincing.  I'm mainly skeptical about the idea of consciousness replication.  My statement was meant to show that even if the brain simulation created a consciousness, it wasn't the same as my consciousness, which would still disappear if I were to die.",1227783318

They build a reliable car, and then sabotage it by stuffing it full of ill-fitting plastic interior parts.<p>Every GM car I've been in recently has felt cheap. You know, interior materials don't cost that much - however much they are saving on this construction is nothing compared to how bad it makes them look.<p>I know many people who work in the automotives field, and the general consensus is that GM uses the worst production methodology out of them all. Parts have high tolerances (i.e. shaky, loose, poor fitting) and that leads to shoddy assembly, which weakens reliability of an otherwise sound design, and generally just feels like junk.<p>If GM tightened their manufacturing tolerances they would do wonders for themselves.",1227783256

I am an experienced developer so learning the language or OO is not a hurdle (although functional programming will be new but not difficult).<p>My other question is an environment one - the OLPC isn't geared up for full blown dev yet so I plan to develop on an Ubuntu VM and then package up an activity and deploy onto Sugar VM and then OLPC. I'm aware that Sugar Activities need to use custom python libraries but I don't know how I would approach getting those libraries into Ubuntu and whether it would work?<p>Currently looking at wing IDE as an option, I use eclipse a lot and have tried the Jython plug in. I'd like something with code completion and ease of use so not looking for suggestions around Vi or Emacs!",1227782755

Is there a book which teaches Javascript for experienced developers, and is preferable geared towards people who know Python already?<p>Ps. How can I get a set type behaviour in JS. This is the python code I want to do in JS ( http://dpaste.com/94047/ ), and cant find one simple way",1227782720

378586,comment,377921,377921,0,0,AlbertSingh,,,"Two aspects of this essay by Keynes seem highly relevant today.<p>I. Keynes stressed the threat which the slump posed to ‘the social stability of every country alike’.<p>‘… a series of bankruptcies, defaults, and repudiations which would shake the capitalist order to its foundations … would be a fertile soil for agitation, seditions, and revolution. It is so already in many quarters of the world.’<p>The only place where I know this aspect of this essay of Keynes and his other writings has been discussed is in Donald Markwell’s book called ‘Economic Paths to War and Peace - John Maynard Keynes and International Relations’ (around pages 172-173).<p>II. Keynes ended by stressing the necessity of the monetary authorities of the big economic powers acting together.<p>‘…nor can any one central bank do enough acting in isolation. … the most effectibe remedy would be that the central banks of these three great creditor nations [the United States, France, and England] should join together in a bold scheme to restore confidence to the international long-term loan market; which would serve to revive enterprise and activity everywhere, and to restore prices and profits, so that in due course the wheels of the world’s commerce would go round again.’<p>As Markwell’s book also shows, this necessity of international economic action is one of the key lessons from Keynes’s thinking, at least from the aftermath of the First World War on.<p>Does anybody else think these two points from Keynes are of the utmost importance to our current global meltdown?",1227782403

378584,comment,377859,377859,0,0,andr,,,"While the direction this is taking is ingenious, the concrete implementation is useless. There's a reason why genetic algorithms are automated - most of the mutations are useless, so it's a waste of person's time to look at all of them.<p>What they could do is have the system teach itself which types of mutations go well with people. body { text-decoration: line-through } is not something anyone would want, yet it's the first thing I got.<p>Edit: minor complaint - no UTF8 support.<p>Another idea - a flicker mode, with the original and evolved design switching every half second or so. That's how astronomers detected disappearing stars in the past.",1227782150

378581,comment,377468,378457,0,0,tc,,,"SBCL has an extremely sophisticated facility called a VOP (Virtual Operation) that allows you to write assembly with s-expressions and integrate the code into the compiler and runtime.  The SBCL backend itself is composed of these VOPs.<p>Significantly, this means that you can write assembly macros with the full power and elegance of lisp.  A trivial example is the move macro, which is used extensively in VOPs:<p><pre><code>  (defmacro move (dst src)
    ""Move SRC into DST unless they are location=.""
    (once-only ((n-dst dst)
                (n-src src))
      `(unless (location= ,n-dst ,n-src)
         (inst mov ,n-dst ,n-src))))
</code></pre>
Check out the SBCL source if you want to see some wild uses of VOPs and macros that expand into assembly code.  In compiler/x86/arith.lisp there is a lisp/assembly implementation of the Mersenne Twister.<p>VOPs can optionally handle argument type checking and can be tuned to emit specialized code in various circumstances, such as when one of the arguments to the call is a compile-time constant.",1227781977

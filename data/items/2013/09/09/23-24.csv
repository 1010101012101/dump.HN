You therefore wouldn&#x27;t verify the output of your compiler with anything that was compiled by that compiler.. instead you would verify it with the owners manual and some underlings to do the grunt work.<p>So you run your compiler, and it punches cards for you.  You then turn off the machine, remove the cards, and verify them.  If that checks out, then you boot the machine with the cards again.  Anything that persists the reboot has to be on those cards, and is therefore subject to uncompromised inspection.",1378771186

You have employees (grad students, lab managers) and equipment/supply/rent(overhead) costs that you use to produce a product (research, in the form of papers).  You produce these products on a kind of account basis (not a per-paper basis), but if you aren&#x27;t producing enough when it&#x27;s time to re-up with your funding agency you lose that grant revenue.  When the revenue situation gets bleak due to either mismanagement or the funding climate (sequester, anybody?), you can even &quot;go out of business&quot; and have to close your lab.

Why are so many types of eyes present? Both reflectors and refractors exist, and refractors exist in lots of variations. Compound eyes of several types exist. A designer would try out designs and variations until he/she/it/them found the best one (for some notion of &quot;best&quot;) and then plop that best eye subsystem in every new animal.<p>That generalizes: &quot;the best&quot; whatever subsystem would show up everywhere after testing variations.  Variations would disappear, and never repeat themselves.<p>We don&#x27;t see that happening. At all.

The idea that it&#x27;s wasting money, or that you&#x27;re paying someone else&#x27;s mortgage, or whatever other argument is thrown out there are part of one of the biggest financial misconceptions going.<p>Do the cost/benefit of renting vs ownership, accounting for maintenance, taxes, interest rates, macro-economic conditions and whatever else and the costs should be very similar.  Of course, it ebbs and flows with the markets, but at the margins is where the decision should be made.  Owning is never a clear winner in all circumstances.<p>That said, with the drastic drop in house prices since 2007 and historically low interest rates, buying has been (in the US at least) a financial gift from the heavens for the past few years.

Right now my total monthly cost is about the same as a 2 bed/1 bath apartment in one of the major apartment complexes in M.V.<p>The thing about mortgages is that ideally the way it should work is that you buy something that fits within your budget, and your payment remains mostly stable while your salary increases due to inflation and/or promotions.  The first few years I owned my condo, my finances were indeed tight, but eventually that eased.<p>The idea that a mortgage is incompatible with being a startup founder seems to be based in the misconception that because a new mortgage is expensive and burdensome today, it will be expensive and burdensome forever. When in reality, after a few years the equation can change quite dramatically.<p>Of course, everyone&#x27;s experience is different, and one can make choices that indeed keep a mortgage expensive and burdensome. But you can do that with renting, too. The question in both cases is simply &quot;can I cover my housing costs for a year or two without a salary?&quot;.<p>Personally, when I contemplate becoming a first-time founder (and yeah, I&#x27;m in my 40s), the fact that I own rather than rent isn&#x27;t a big consideration.",1378770614

As you probably know, today Syria and Russia have agreed to the proposal by Kerry that the only way to prevent attacks is to put the WMD&#x27;s under international control. And the US reaction, at least immediate, was to instantly shift the goals of Syria bombings from helping the people of Syria to &quot;Making a point for international community&quot;, and state that it welcomes the political solution but is still going to bomb Syria nevertheless.<p>2. In fact, the Obama administration has constantly shifted the goals of the bombings, to the point when it is really hard to take their arguments seriously. They were stating that they are not going to force Assad out of power, now they are stating that they are going to force Assad out of power, etc.<p>I hope that I have answered your question about why the bombings are a great potential threat to the people of Syria. I don&#x27;t see the US trying to find a peaceful solution.<p>3. Obama is a mass murderer himself, he kills thousands of people by drones, not to mention the &quot;double drone attack&quot; tactic that targets first responders, which constitutes a war crime under international law. [7] And the list can be continued with mass tortures (for which large number of torturers have recently got official immunity [8]), extraordinary rendition, etc.<p>Man, suppose we have a large family in which one of the members is abusing others. You are suggesting feeding an entire family to a crocodile (US bombs and forein jihadis brought in by Quatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey) as a remedy.

But the Eurasian Balkans are infinitely more important as a potential economic prize: an enormous concentration of natural gas and oil reserves is located in the region, in addition to important minerals, including gold.&quot; (p.124)</i><p><i>&quot;The world&#x27;s energy consumption is bound to vastly increase over the next two or three decades. Estimates by the U.S. Department of energy anticipate that world demand will rise by more than 50 percent between 1993 and 2015, with the most significant increase in consumption occurring in the Far East. The momentum of Asia&#x27;s economic development is already generating massive pressures for the exploration and exploitation of new sources of energy and the Central Asian region and the Caspian Sea basin are known to contain reserves of natural gas and oil that dwarf those of Kuwait, the Gulf of Mexico, or the North Sea.&quot; (p.125)</i><p><i>&quot;In fact, an Islamic revival - already abetted from the outside not only by Iran but also by Saudi Arabia - is likely to become the mobilizing impulse for the increasingly pervasive new nationalisms, determined to oppose any reintegration under Russian - and hence infidel - control.&quot; (p. 133).</i><p><i>&quot;It follows that America&#x27;s primary interest is to help ensure that no single power comes to control this geopolitical space and that the global community has unhindered financial and economic access to it.&quot; (p148)</i><p><i>&quot;America is now the only global superpower, and Eurasia is the globe&#x27;s central arena. Hence, what happens to the distribution of power on the Eurasian continent will be of decisive importance to America&#x27;s global primacy and to America&#x27;s historical legacy.&quot; (p.194)</i><p><i>&quot;With warning signs on the horizon across Europe and Asia, any successful American policy must focus on Eurasia as a whole and be guided by a Geostrategic design.&quot; (p.197)</i><p><i>&quot;That puts a premium on maneuver and manipulation in order to prevent (preempt) the emergence of a hostile coalition that could eventually seek to challenge America&#x27;s primacy...&quot; (p. 198)</i><p>Zbigniew Brzezinski, &quot;The Grand Chessboard&quot;: <a href=""http://www.takeoverworld.info/Grand_Chessboard.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.takeoverworld.info/Grand_Chessboard.pdf</a>\nObama: I&#x27;ve learned an immense amount from Dr. Brzezinski: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASlETEx0T-I"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASlETEx0T-I</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/17/syrians-support-assad-western-propaganda"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/17/syrians...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.livingunderdrones.org/living-under-drones/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.livingunderdrones.org/living-under-drones/</a><p>[8] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q14fz0Bd-kM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q14fz0Bd-kM</a>",1378770322

While some of the victims were active in the opposition, many of them were killed\nunlawfully after having been taken captive; others\nappear to have been targeted simply because\nthey were living in opposition-held areas and\nas such may have been considered supporters of\narmed opposition groups, including those linked\nto the FSA. Others were reportedly killed\nsimply because soldiers wanted\nto take revenge on people from the area and/or could not find\nthose they were looking for.</i> [2]<p>That is not to say that Assad is not to be held accountable for at least part of this deaths, but it is a civil war death toll, and not the number of deaths in detention/and deliberate killings.<p>I think that Assad is a horrible guy. His father was obviously a brutal dictator and Assad has mismanaged the country so badly that it fell into the civil war. I have personally seen videos of the shootings at demonstrators. One of the most touching and at the same time not explicitly graphic being this one [3]. I think that he&#x27;s got to be held accountable for what he did. But not at the expense of tens of thousands dead innocent people.<p><i>>AGAIN: WHY WOULD THE RESULTS OF THE STRIKES BE WORSE THAN LETTING THE MASS MURDERERS GET AWAY WITH IT, SO THEY KEEP USING WMD??? (Not to mention keep using air/artillery on civilians.)</i><p>Here, I would abstain from commenting on the validity of claims that the chemical weapons were used by Assad regime, since I think that I&#x27;ve already made my point that the so called &#x27;evidence&#x27; is not to be taken seriously. Even the members of the US House Intelligence Committee that have seen the full classified version of it don&#x27;t seem to consider the evidence compelling. Even the White House chief of staff has stated that the &quot;Administration lacks irrefutable beyond-a-reasonable-doubt evidence&quot;. Let&#x27;s consider that the WMD was used by the explicit order of Assad, just for the sake of the argument.<p>0. Why not call for peace talks, and/or immediate ceasefire? It is the US and Syrian opposition that has continuously abstained from them.<p>1. First and foremost, if the good of the Syrian people is to be taken as the priority, before any strike there should be a plan that takes potential civilian death toll into consideration. There is no such plan, not to my knowledge. And not to the knowledge of the members of the UK House of Commons and US State Senators (at least, the ones whose testimony I watched). How are you going to imply that the death toll would be magically minimal? Do you really think that it is the matter to be discussed without relying on documents, calculations, etc.? You somehow seem to imply that it is commonsensical that the death toll would be low, but that is not enough, as the past shows.<p>1.A. Kosovo (in this thread I have made a sourced point about the civilian death toll in Kosovo operation and the fact that it was well above the supposed number of Milosevic victims).<p>1.B. Iraq. Invation of Iraq has led to a horrendous civil war with tens of thousands (by conservative numbers) civilians killed, and that is not to mention couple of thousands of civilians that were killed during the invasion itself. Sorry, US has destroyed this country, it&#x27;s infrastructure, etc. etc. The fact that Saddam was a horrible guy is not a validation for destroying the lives of millions of Iraqis. This is a crime against humanity, the same one for which people were hanged after Nuremberg Trials. Not to mention the horrible illnesses that were inflicted on Iraqis by depleted uranium contamination.<p>Actually, the list can go on, and on, and on.<p>As a large number of experts claim, and as I have written in previous comments, the situation could potentially deteriorate and go out of control. Israel is preparing for potential armed conflict with Iran as a result of this war. Turkey is preparing it&#x27;s troops for potential ground invasion of Syria. Etc. etc. etc., I have written about it in this very thread. The civil war in Syria is not a war of Assad against all of it&#x27;s people (or he would&#x27;ve already lost long time ago). It is a war between various factions in Syria and outside of Syria. It is a war of Alawites against members of other sects. It is a war between Sunni and Shia. It is a war of Syrian people against invasion of foreign jihadi militants from all over the world. It is a war of Quatar for the ability to sell natural gas on the European market (they finance foreign militants to be able to install the regime that will allow to build pipeline over Syrian territory). It is a war of Saudi Arabia, United States [4] [5] for the regional domination. It is a war of Iran for it&#x27;s security. It could be a war of Israel to potentially gain more territories beyond Golan Heights. It is a war of Russia for the domination of the European natural gas market. It is a war of Russia with it&#x27;s very own jihadists that have travelled to Syria from Chechnya, the list goes on, and on, and on. Oh, and also this is an opportunity for the Kurds to create their own nation state. And a war of different factions of Iraqis against each other.<p>Just to elaborate, according to a Qatari poll that was made in the end of 2011, 55% of Syrians were supportive of Assad at the time.

Sure, the language may have some standard libraries that would do much the same things that these do in other languages, but those libraries could be improved, removed, or replaced by the programmer.<p>What exactly is the <i>point</i> of a type system?  I think there are really two big ones: program verification and metadata tagging. To simplify, the former is why Haskellers love types, and the latter seems to be the main reason that F#&#x27;s type providers exist (and why C# programmers love creating lots of little types rather than using typeless object literals a la Ruby).<p>Intellisense is an incredibly seductive thing, and many programmers in the enterprise world would argue that any language that can&#x27;t show you that little &quot;box&quot; after you press Ctrl+Space is dead on arrival.<p>But both of those things are a subset of the things you COULD do if the phases of compilation were in your control. Maybe you want a function that says &quot;throw an error at compile time if someone uses this deprecated parameter on this API call&quot;, or maybe you&#x27;d like to have a function where if you call it with a hard-coded URL, the program fails at compile time if the URL can&#x27;t be reached.<p>These are obviously a bit silly, but the point is that, to many of us, WHENEVER a compiler is doing something with our AST, that should be fully exposed and not a black box. Another example: why is Idris[1] its own language? Why isn&#x27;t it just a Haskell library? Granted that also gets into programmable syntax and editor support thereof, but that&#x27;s part of my larger point as well.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.idris-lang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.idris-lang.org/</a>",1378769700

Insulation is amazing, and it&#x27;s weather-proof. They&#x27;re rated safe against tornadoes, for instance. As a bonus, it&#x27;s also fireproof, so you can put one up in the mountains and not worry about forest fires destroying it.<p>The frameless dome is a neat trick and an elegant design, but there are a dozen other techniques I&#x27;d rather use to build a &quot;simple&quot; home.

Compared to the &#x27;motorhome&#x27; business where the company buys a Chassis from Ford or Chevy <i>as a chassis to build a new vehicle on.</i><p>Makes for an interesting conundrum. You can fail fast and iterate prototyping like this, and you can arrive at a saleable product for which there is no route to production because the underlying tech you rely on cannot be used &#x27;legally&#x27; the way you want to use it, and the amount of money the product might conceivably generate is less than the cost of re-creating the crucial bit of technology from scratch.",1378768595

6356904,comment,6355738,6355738,36,0,reikonomusha,,,"Here is my brief review of the articles as a whole. As a little background, I&#x27;ve been writing Lisp professionally for a while at many companies, both start ups and top-tier tech companies.<p>I like writing about Lisp[1], and have been so far as to write blog posts ranging from why parentheses are a good thing to what kinds of data types Common Lisp has. I think there is still a place for writing about Lisp, but I don&#x27;t think this e-zine accomplished the task to make it interesting.<p>Lisp unfortunately attracts a lot of fluff writing. Writing about how wonderful, deep, rich, or sophisticated it is. Writing about how it completely blows one&#x27;s mind and takes you to this baroque, fluid land of programming literacy. I must admit that I&#x27;ve even been sucked into the vortex at a point in my Lisp career.<p>Then there are particular topics that get rehashed over and over again: what makes a Lisp? which is the best Lisp? which is the most practical? lisp-1 vs. lisp-2? was r6rs a failure? why are macros so great? why does Lisp subsume every programming language ever?<p>I found in this e-zinewhose title I can&#x27;t repeat without bloating the paragraphs I writethat I didn&#x27;t really gain anything after reading it all. What did I learn about T? I just learned that it was some language with interesting concepts, backed up with a paltry offering of examples. What did I learn about Apple? To me, it seemed like an opinion: Since Apple isn&#x27;t doing wacky Lisp things, it no longer is catering to those with ideas. (This is something I disagree with.)<p>Regarding topics, I also found this e-zine to be somewhat haphazard in its arrangement. Maybe it&#x27;s just the visual layout, but the topics didn&#x27;t really flow, and it read more like a long blog post with randomly selected topics interjected with philosophical ideas about categorization.<p>I have a hard time really seeing, after reading, who this e-zine is for. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;d interest the general programming enthusiast, because it&#x27;s just about a class of languages that few people actually use. It constantly shows code and uses jargon that the general programmer probably isn&#x27;t accustomed with. It barely seems to appeal to veteran Lisp programmers because there&#x27;s little depth and lots of the aforementioned fluff. The only group I can think it appeals to are people who have casually brushed next to Lisp at a previous time and wish to be re-injected with a shot of apparent beauty and mysticism they once saw, but never had time time or patience to fully reach.<p>My suggestion for future articles: Instead of trying to talk about all Lisps all the time, and talk about beaten-to-death topics that pop up on Usenet everyday, talk about something more technical and be comprehensive. What is something really interesting about Common Lisp? Though not exactly in the format I&#x27;d have for a magazine article, I wrote about &quot;linear random access sequences&quot; in Lisp here:<p><a href=""http://symbo1ics.com/blog/?p=1845"" rel=""nofollow"">http://symbo1ics.com/blog/?p=1845</a><p>What about an overview of how the object system in T works? How about examples of how Lisp has solved problems in the industry that people <i>don&#x27;t</i> know about (i.e., people know about ITA, the space probe, Jak & Dexter game, etc. because they&#x27;re the examples that continue to propagate)?<p>How about where Lisp falls short? Lisp is a language that was ahead of its time, but there are language features now that seem beyond Lisp&#x27;s grasp. Where has it failed?<p>All in all, I was somewhat disappointed, especially given the well qualified and articulate author. I think there&#x27;s potential, but I don&#x27;t think Read-Eval-Print-Love has successfully converged to what it should or could be.<p>I do wish Code Quarterly[2] was successful. Fogus even seemed to contribute to it with an interview with Rich Hickey. But, as outlined here[3], there wasn&#x27;t enough motivation from the writers to make it successful.<p>[1] <a href=""http://symbo1ics.com/blog/?cat=10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://symbo1ics.com/blog/?cat=10</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.codequarterly.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codequarterly.com/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://gigamonkeys.wordpress.com/2011/10/17/end-of-the-line-for-code-quarterly/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gigamonkeys.wordpress.com/2011/10/17/end-of-the-line-...</a>",1378768117

People love this word because it sounds fancy and marks them as someone who geeks out on programming, but the fact is that this word is, if not ambiguous, at least prone to abuse.  Let me give a specific example.<p>The new language Julia has a macro system and Julia&#x27;s designers claim that the language is homoiconic.  Is it?  It has a way to quote expressions such that<p><pre><code>    a + b\n</code></pre>\nis just the result of a + b whereas<p><pre><code>    :(a + b)\n</code></pre>\nreturns the expression tree for a + b.  This can then be modified, eval&#x27;d, and otherwise sliced and diced.  But what does that expression tree look like?  When you print it in Julia, you get something like:<p><pre><code>    head: call\n    args:\n        [0] symbol(:+)\n        [1] symbol(:a)\n        [2] symbol(:b)\n    type: any\n</code></pre>\nQuestion: does that look like a normal snippet of Julia code you could paste into your test editor and eval?  No.  The &quot;real&quot; syntax for that code is something like:<p><pre><code>    {:call, {:+, :a, :b}, Any} \n</code></pre>\n(Julia-ish pseudocode, not precise)<p>In any event, while you CAN write a Julia program using the literal syntax for the data structures that represent Julia programs, people usually don&#x27;t do that.<p>So what does homoiconic mean?  Does it mean that you can get to the data structure representing your code and then manipulate it at will?  Or does it mean that PLUS the fact that programs in your language always take exactly the form of  the data structure that represents that code?<p>If the former, then a lot of languages (including C# with its expression trees) can claim to be partially or fully homoiconic.  If the latter, then the list is much smaller.<p>So would a homoiconic Haskell be a lisp?  I think what you&#x27;d end up with after taking things far enough wouldn&#x27;t be Haskell at all.  It&#x27;d be a lisp with a REALLY good type system.<p>After all, things like monads and morphisms and applicative functors aren&#x27;t Haskell, they&#x27;re mathematics.",1378767766

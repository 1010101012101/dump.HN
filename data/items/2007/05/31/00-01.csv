It does depend on the state because California is at will, other states may vary. I guess most of us young folks have to realize that we are entitled to nothing. I guess that is the good thinking about creating our own businesses.",1180571475
25547,comment,25414,25416,0,0,nickb,,,"Consult a real lawyer ASAP. Probably none of us here are lawyers and we might inadvertently give you some bad advice. Don't just write off your options... you might get them to give you an early cliff or might allow you to vest a large portion of your shares. Certainly, they don't have to do that and firing you is their right and they owe you nothing but maybe a threat of a lawsuit will change their mind. No startup wants to have a lawsuit on their hands since it drains time & money from productive things and it looks really bad during the due diligence phase since it introduces uncertainty.<p>Talk to them first... see if you can get your options or a prorated portion of them before contacting lawyers. But make sure that you notify them that you will pursue this matter through courts if you can't settle amicably.",1180571134

Personally, I haven't used a desktop email client since early 2001 (after losing my laptop and after failing to restore my backup). I prefer to have email online since it's accessible from everywhere and it's backed up (one would hope anyway). <p>But I think what they're building is cool and I hope some of their ideas end up in online email clients.",1180570520

25539,comment,25410,25489,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"What?<p>That is a VERY simple assertion relating to something that is a bit more complicated.  I think most people here should brush up on the idea of attachment networks, or organizational ecology.  I'll give you the short version, the top two companies win where preferential attachment is what determines whether a user stays with you.<p>Of course there are exceptions.  For instance, one could be providing information on a web site that would be a challenge to get elsewhere.  The Wall Street Journal comes to mind.  With these companies, attachment is irrelevant, if a user has a great need for the information s/he MUST go to the Wall Street Journal.<p>Most of the web 2.0 startups I have reviewed, and there have been many, are NECESSARILY based around preferential attachment.  I understand this tendency.  After all, if startup Y can implement the idea of startup X in less than 3 months time, then startup X will have an issue to deal with.  So it is in the interest of startup X to make sure that users prefer them.  Add to that the fact that most are banking on providing the user convenient access to his OWN data, and you have the makings of a good number of also rans.<p>I always ask, what happens if the user takes his data elsewhere?  <p>""It'll never happen"", is usually the answer.<p>I inquire as to the possibility of a recession and a concomitant slow down in internet advertising.  Like all of the 25 year old mortgage brokers 4 years ago, most of the founders look at me like I just came from Mars.  There is a new economy, get on board or get out of the way.<p>So I walk a little ways off...<p>And wait for the wreck, maybe I can get a good deal on parts.",1180570231

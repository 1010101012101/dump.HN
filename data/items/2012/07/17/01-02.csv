Let's say you have a teenage daughter who is also attractive and some guy stars to follow you a few feet in fron while recording her on video.  While probably legal in most parts of the world this behavior is almost guaranteed to cause the videographer a lot of trouble, and rightly so.<p>Then there are other invasion-of-privacy type issues like people who choose to smoke in public.  I recently had the experience of having dinner with my family in the outdoor dining area of a restaurant when a group of youngsters sat at the table next to us and started to smoke.  They showed total disregard for the fact that we were being forced to inhale their smoke, even my young kids.  We had been there for an hour, they just showed up and we were engulfed in a cloud of smoke.  Legal? Yes? Incredibly rude and inconsiderate? Absolutely!",1342490239

4253660,comment,4247735,4247735,1,0,bluesnowmonkey,,,"He doesn't take the point about robot horses very far, but that's where the conversation will go in time.<p>Maybe flight is a better example.  We always knew it was possible to fly because we saw birds doing it.  Birds fly by flapping their wings.  We tried to make flying machines that flap their wings.  They didn't fly.<p>Birds evolved to flap their wings because it exploited the technology available to evolution.  Birds are made out of the same stuff as other animals, just tweaked a bit to be lighter.  Flapping is a lot like running or swimming physiologically -- swinging a limb back and forth in a certain pattern.  Evolution can do a lot with warm-blooded animals with limbs.<p>When we figured out how to make artificial flying machines, the solution exploited the advantages of <i>our</i> technology.  Planes are made out of the same stuff as cars, just tweaked a bit to be lighter.  Spinning a propeller is a lot like spinning a wheel.  We can do a lot with combustion engines that spin things.<p>The missing pieces were the principles of aerodynamics, some technology (IC engine, construction materials), and some engineering specific to the problem of flight.  Since we figured it out, we're able to make machines that fly faster and higher than anything in nature.  <i>Vastly</i> faster and higher.<p>Right now we're trying to build machines that think -- not just compute.  We know that thinking is possible because we see brains doing it.  Brains do it with neurons and synapses.  We tried to make thinking machines out of neurons and synapses.  They didn't think.<p>Brains are made of neurons because that's what evolution had available.  Neurons are a lot like other cells in the body -- blood cells, skin cells, muscle cells.  Evolution is good at specializing cells to do all kinds of jobs.<p>When we figure out how to make thinking machines, the solution will exploit the advantages of the technology of the day.  It will look like something we already have, but tweaked.  We're good with transistors and silicon.  We're good at computer networks.<p>We definitely have missing pieces.  We don't know much about the principles of intelligence.  We understand logic, but how do you get intelligence from logic?  And maybe we're still missing some key technology to make it work.  (Memristors?  Graphene?)  And once we have the principles and the technology, it'll take some engineering to make it work, but we'll make it work.  We'll building thinking machines that are <i>vastly</i> smarter, wiser, and more clever than nature ever did.<p>The point is that if we ever upload a brain, it will be like building a mechanical horse -- an over-engineered gimmick, a parlor trick.  We'll already have done much better at AI by approaching the problem from a different direction.<p>It doesn't bode well for humanity though, in the long term.  Just about the only jobs left are <i>thinking</i> jobs.  What happens when it's a waste of time for a human to think, just like it's a waste of time for a horse to pull a plow?  We didn't declare war on horses, Terminator-style.  We just didn't keep very many around.",1342488548

Adding the additional translation layer of javac or equivalent <i>increases</i> the potential of being affected by bugs in third-party code. Let P be the probability of encountering a bug in the JVM, and Q be the probability of encountering a bug in javac. If we multiply the complements, (1-Q)x(1-P) we have the probability of final execution being in keeping with the HaXe implementation's intentions. Assuming all values are nonzero, (1-P)x(1-Q) < (1-P), therefore the additional translation layer increases the probability of being affected by a bug. Not to mention that the vastly more complex output format increases the possibility of introducing bugs into HaXe itself.<p>> output is ""as good as"" target-native code.<p>But it isn't. Translating code between languages is lossy. Unless HaXe is trivial, the HaXe implementation has information that could be used to generate better bytecode that is lost when bytecode generation is performed by a tool that knows nothing about HaXe, e.g. javac.",1342488201

Because that will hopefully then lead to more attention from graphics card driver makers, solving one of Linux's last remaining weaknesses compared to Windows.<p>With Microsoft following Apple into the post-PC era (or ""PC Plus"", as MS COO Kevin Turner likes to call it), Linux will be the last major OS with a traditional desktop metaphor as its dominant UI. Despite all the statements that the PC is dead, I think it will still have widespread uses, at least until brain-computer interfaces become a reality, because touchscreens simply cannot replace keyboards/mice in a large number of contexts.",1342487201

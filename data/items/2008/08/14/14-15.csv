You can only measure different properties of the particles.<p>It doesn't really make sense. Think of it as, there's probably something really intuitive happening, but physicists haven't figured that out yet. Instead we only have really complicated formulas and unintuitive metaphors. So don't think that necessarily things ""really change"" when you measure them. That's just the simplest assumption we have right now that makes the formulas workable.",1218725917

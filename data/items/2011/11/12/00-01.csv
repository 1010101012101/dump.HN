The Air Force has pushed especially hard to establish themselves in this area, because they see some of their existing core capabilities being marginalized, and they need to keep finding ways to keep themselves relevant.  Although the Air Force is pushing hardest in this direction, the other services are also trying to expand their cyber capabilities, and the Navy even recently established a designator for officers to basically be hackers:\n<a href=""http://www.informationwarriors.net/showthread.php?t=623"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.informationwarriors.net/showthread.php?t=623</a>",1321059521

3226764,comment,3197143,3197143,1,0,timscott,,,"I agree with almost all of what you said. I'm a coder, agilist, craftsman, blah, blah who has worked on a startup more than once. On the last one I wrote almost no unit tests.  The whole thing was so experimental from the start that I never go around to it.  I explained it to myself that I was being a hustler.  I'm okay with that.<p>However, I gotta say it. If unit tests are making it harder to restructure your code, you're doing it wrong. The opposite should be true. The greatest purpose of unit tests is to add comfort and safety (and thus speed) to very big refactors and restructuring. If your system behavior changes, yes, your tests gotta change, and that takes effort. But if you restructure your code (e.g., break it apart to add an intermediate abstraction) and unit tests slow you down because you got get all up in 'em, then brother you got yourself some bad tests.  Those should not have written.",1321059415

Bear in mind that the ""balking"" rate follows a kind of inverse poisson distribution. You get the most price balkers at the lower price points (the cheapskates). As you move towards the sweet spot, the balkers quickly disappear. As you move further along, you cut off more and more potential clients, but it's far more gradual than the original uptick.<p>Keep raising your prices until you're at a point where you're not getting more work than you can handle. That point is precisely how much your time is worth in dollars.<p>It's not a question of how you rate vs other people. It's a question of how much your customers pay you.

I was fine with that and would expect it, if you walk you loose it I am amazed that their are contracts out there in original form that would state differently. If it where my company and my contract, it would absolutely state all options revert back to the company in the event of resignation. From the perspective of an employee I would be and have been more than happy to sign to that agreement. If it is not going to be a fit, one side generally figures that out early on and in such case I would not feel entitles to options if I where the one deciding to leave.

Everyone makes mistakes and you have shown a lot of resiliency which is key to being successful in anything.<p>I agree with what a couple other people have mentioned. You're not alone. Almost everyone feels that way at one point in time - it's a fact of life. You don't instantly become CEO...you have to work your way up.<p>Also, you should increase your prices a bit. There is a reason you are getting web jobs and you need other people working for you. You are out of balance. If you can't hire anyone then ideally you would like just the right amount of work for you (meaning you lose some customers by raising the cost).<p>Finally, don't worry about which languages you know. If you know 5 languages, but you're not fantastic at them then you're just average anyway. Specialize in HTML, who cares? If you're the best you'll make money so keep learning.<p>By the way, don't buy into this whole American dream where you should go deep into debt to mortgage a new house and car. Much of the world spends much longer at home and 24 is by no means old, especially if you're saving money. Keep driving that clunker and enjoying the time with your family while you save your money.<p>Send me an email (in profile) if you want to talk some more.",1321058893

Consciously putting effort into presenting yourself in a good light isn't something that's automatic; it requires practice.  If you put too much effort into it, then you might come off as a sleazy used car salesman. Focus on what you do and how you do it and the branding will emerge effortlessly and naturally.  You won't be a product that way; you'll be a process (or a platform, as Jason puts it).<p>It's typically not my style to call out specific individuals and make examples of them.

The great value of such service is in learning to do the mission, to live with the frustrations of political vacillation that can decide what was worth great risk one day now might cost votes, to work with others that humble you with their own talent once you mature enough to recognize it, to absolutely be there when someone depends on it, and to develop and develop with those around you such that you know they will also be there when you need it.

Google TV played video but you had to pay $300, or about $200-$250 more than competing devices, and didn't play games. It cost as much as a modern gaming console. If it was $100 and had good integration with SmartPhones and tablets it would at least be a pretty good accessory for some people who didn't want a gaming console.

The salary is about average, health and dental insurance ($X / month), stock options, 401k matching, Y days of paid time off plus other benefits.<p>Job two is in my current city that I am located in and have lived in for years. I really like this city and I really want to stay here. Job1 has a below average salary ($10k less than Job1), $X/2 per month reimbursement for health care (it does not say anything about insurance, just ""reimbursement""), no stock options and  Y/2 days time off.<p>Both companies seem great.

I estimate that my hand has 35% equity, so I go ahead and call.<p>I'm going to lose 65% of the time, I'm going to be ridiculed by poor players without knowledge of equity and pot odds, and I'll question whether I actually made the right decision. The other 35% of the time, I'll win that $150, feel good that I made the right decision, and those same people will call me a lucky moron.<p>The average result is that I gain $100 * 0.35 - $50 * 0.65 = $2.50[0] every time I make this decision. My decision was good, even if the outcome is highly volatile (nearly 2/3 of the time, I lose).<p>Now the player I was up against says that because I got lucky and won with a worse hand, I don't deserve the full $150 that's in the pot. How about if I give him 10% of that as consolation, since he ""should have won""? Everyone else at the table agrees that's reasonable (after all, I'm just an idiot who got lucky), and now the equity of my decision works out to 85 * 0.35 - 50 * 0.65 = -$2.75[1], and I'm actually losing money on my original decision.<p>Changing the terms <i>after I've made an informed decision</i> is more than shady: it makes my original decision (based on the overall expected value) incorrect in retrospect. <i>That</i> is what people have a problem with. If early employees now have to account for some nonzero chance of getting fucked on their equity, it's going to make it that much harder for an early startup to afford anyone. Limiting the upside of an investment drastically lowers the risk an investor (and an early employee is effectively an investor) can rationally bear.<p>[0] At the time of my decision, there was $100 in the pot for me to win. I win it 35% of time, and the other 65% of the time I lose the $50 that I'm paying now.<p>[1] 150 - 10% = 135 - 50 (the amount that I put into the pot to call) = 85.",1321056034

My issue is not with how you treated your customers, which sounds fine, but with your strange complaining that your customers should have somehow known about your not-quite-unlimited definition of the word ""unlimited"", and that <i>they</i> were the ones using unusual definitions of the word, rather than you.<p>All other advertisers manage to find room for caveats when they make overarching claims, even if it's in weaselly fine print or fast speech. I don't see why we should treat ISPs any differently. If it's unlimited*, where the asterisk means ""not quite"", that asterisk and explanation need to be present, and people who don't see it and assume that ""unlimited"" takes on its common meaning aren't in the wrong.",1321056020

What I am saying is that it is fundamentally immoral for the company to exercise that power when the very basic meeting of the minds is something along these lines:<p>""Take a risk working for me. I can't pay as much as you could otherwise earn, but I can give you equity instead. Some day, if we do well, it will be worth a lot of money and we'll all be rich"".<p>That lawyers and tax men have screwed up these agreements to the point of absurdity does not change the fact that this is basically the promise that is made. It should be kept.",1321056017

This is great for artists, but unless your creating art getting withing 5 pixels of what you mean is plenty for most interface tasks. So, when job's said how poor styluses are his context was cellphones which nobody uses to create art and using a stylus is painful.  In those rare cases where someone actually wants to sketch something out on a cellphone you can zoom in a lot which is not efficient but hey your using a cellphone get over yourself.<p>As to iPad's the same issues shows up, using a Stylus on top of a screen is less accurate than using a separate tablet, not to mention it's resolution is terrible for creating real art.  Sure, it's better than a cellphone, but fingerprinting is plenty for most people's level of artistic talent.<p>PS: My sister is a graphics artist and she get's sub-pixel accuracy with a cheap qualcom tablet.  Covering up part of the immage your working on is reasonable, but when using pen on paper she often rotates the paper to minimize the effect which slows things down with clunky computer controls.",1321056000

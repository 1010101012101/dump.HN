If you can't afford it, that is a technological issue. There is no such thing as someone with ""too much money"".<p>[edit: there are certainly things that money can't buy. Though I'm sure you can mail-order a lovely bride, a Zen Buddhist sensei fresh from Japan, and adopt some children in need to give your life meaning]",1197557519

89157,comment,88924,89068,0,0,angryprofessor,,,"I agree with you, to a point. But lets not ignore the drawbacks of paper voting: a bunch of old ladies counting paper ballots can have error rates approaching 1%. <p>Better electronic systems are possible.<p>In NJ, we have an electronic machine which is just a bunch of buttons and lights: push a button, a light in row 1 goes on, push the commit button, and ""Row a, column b"" is recorded. A translucent paper ballot indicating the meaning of ""Row a, columnb b"" is placed on top of the lights/buttons, so the machine doesn't know which row/column corresponds to which candidate.<p>Using a machine like this, and physically randomizing the rows/columns machine by machine on election day (which isn't done in NJ), software fraud would be difficult.<p>Of course, none of this will stop fraudulent voting (which is very easy), zombie voting and other old fashioned trickery (google the washington governor's election, seattle district in particular).<p>I voted under a phony name in 2006, due to bad handwriting. After I discovered this, I called up my old roommate, who voted under my name (rather than his) in my old town. Vote totals were unnaffected, but only because we were honest.",1197556376

I've done some research on how to develop all kind of Microsoft Surface related stuff, and no doubt there are a lot of alternatives to create a similar effect in a much cheaper way. However, I haven't seen anything this versatile... this idea and implementation is absolutely fantastic.",1197555837

What this means is that if you are serious about your start-up, you should shoot for nothing less than being in the 5-10 ""really useful"" list. <p>It is not easy by any means and pg has said before that as more and more start-ups launch, the difference between great ones and average ones would become more apparent.",1197554932

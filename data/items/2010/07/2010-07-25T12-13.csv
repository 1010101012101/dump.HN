The problem with this argument is that in hinges on <i>your</i> view of what constitutes 'meaninglessness'.

Over time your tolerance for junk food will go down and you will want less of it;<p>- If you really want a hit of junk food, just have it. There is no point dwelling on it. I will have one piece of sugary food with my coffee at around 10:00, which keeps me satisfied. Sometimes I binge out after not having a lot for so long (months), but when your tolerance for processed food goes down you will stop much sooner (through a mixture of guilt and physiological repulsion);<p>- If you want sugar, eat 'good' sugar, i.e. fruit;<p>- Have a bowl of healthy nibbles lying around to munch on when walking past. I always have grapes and nuts in the kitchen that I pick at;<p>- Always eat breakfast. I have mine as soon as wake-up;<p>- Cook your own meals and don't eat processed food;<p>- Drink water rather than carbonated drinks;<p>- Eat smaller meals more often. I try to eat something every three hours;<p>- Follow the Japanese (I think) philosophy of eating until only 80% full, not bursting at the seams. For me the ideal amount of food is a cereal bowl worth of food;<p>- Have a drink about 30 - 60 mins after you have eaten, not during a meal. This helps to top-up the fullness feeling and also allows food to be digested more efficiently before the digestive enzymes get diluted by a drink;<p>- Don't try and justify eating rubbish by doing exercise. You are what you eat.<p>The end result is that people always tell me I am too skinny even though I eat a lot. I don't need to do that much exercise because my diet is good.

It started a few years ago when it really began to dawn on me that almost every single sociological problem that a society develops can be traced back to errors in its educational system. I began to imagine -- as realistically as possible -- just what kind of societies might develop based on different kinds of educational systems.<p>There's a neat sub-problem though that you allude to: since we assume that education feeds into sociological tendencies which feed back into education, how can you dramatically alter the direction of an education system once it has been moving in a particular way for several decades?<p>I think the answer is best exemplified in games of strategy, like Go. In general, any time you're faced with an overwhelmingly powerful opponent, you try to find a niche they don't care about, you establish a small, self-supporting base in that niche, and then you grow it as quietly as possible for as long as possible. So, for example, if you tried to attack the current education system head-on, in the form of essays or books or school boards or legislation, you will probably fail. But, what if:<p>1. You start with one or two after-school, extracurricular activities;<p>2. You develop some rigorous, detailed, well-thought-out goals and methods for teaching them;<p>3. You slowly add on more programs;<p>4. You centralize them into a single facility;<p>5. You begin to offer a not-worthless certificate at the successful end of each program thanks to (2).<p>Well, now you've just gone and launched something which can push against the current educational system a little bit. If you make this successful, you can begin to -- a little tiny bit at a time -- publicly ask questions like, ""Why don't public schools have programs like this?""<p>It may be slow, but after spending a lot of brain time considering a large number of various ways of changing an educational system, this is the approach that I think has the best chances of success.<p>I've been putting a lot of energy recently into growing my business, so that I can finance a small store in the next 9 months or so, so that I can have an appropriate space to offer a fun, basic mechatronics program next Summer, which is my step #1.",1280059561

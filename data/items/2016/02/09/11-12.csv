That&#x27;s the law in the United States.<p>You will get a huge bill afterwards and there will absolutely be <i>financial</i> consequences, but not medical ones.<p>It&#x27;s illegal for a hospital ER to refuse you due to lack of sufficient insurance. The point is that you won&#x27;t die, so you <i>will</i> be around to come back and sue the broker. (In fact, insurance lawsuits are super common.)<p>Not to mention that we&#x27;re dealing with a hypothetical case where you <i>do</i> actually have insurance but it&#x27;s somehow insufficient (which, by the way, is unlikely under Obamacare). In that case, you would absolutely get treated, but your insurer would refuse to cover the bill and would pass it on to you. You could then sue Zenefits for misrepresenting the product and seek damages to cover the bill.<p>> same insurance products requiring licenses as mentioned in the article<p>They&#x27;re not the same in that I&#x27;m talking about individual insurance and the article is group insurance, but that&#x27;s irrelevant to the point.

11064700,comment,11063178,11064241,0,0,DyslexicAtheist,,,"Generally I&#x27;d be reluctant to trust any free service in exchange for my data. LinkedIn is even worse than that because even I pay they constantly overstep and gradually tear down any external APIs (until total user lock-in which is the current state of affair). I can no longer export my own connections, ... or query the interface for basic BI (e.g. which companies in Paris are working on BigData technologies etc).<p>Further there is a huge problem with companies being shit when it comes to providing feedback to candidates (which to be fair this problem LinkedIn never offered to solve). An issue that Glassdoor initially because they positioned themselves as some kind of review platform. But unfortunately glassdoor did a u-turn and now copy/paste LinkedIn&#x27;s subscription/recruitment model 1:1 and even spams me more often than LinkedIn asking me to buy their job-posting packages.<p>The problem is that there is no way of holding companies accountable to their recruitment practices. If you apply for a job you have no idea why you get no feedback or what happened with your data that you supplied. How many other applicants have also never heard again or been left waiting for 3 months without an answer from the company. One of my companies is in recruitment so I know a thing or 2 about how recruiters often are stuck in the middle if the client doesn&#x27;t provide proper feedback of why a candidate gets rejected.<p>Pushing for transparency here would be a killer service. Though I&#x27;m totally disillusioned with another walled garden where I have to take some founders word for it. I want to see something anonymous that does not put the candidate at risk if they give bad feedback about an employer. Also it should be decentralized and without a possibility to be killed (e.g. no censorship or EU data protection law or &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; should allow an employer to remove a bad review/comment from the web). I think the blockchain would lend itself to such a concept.",1455019118

Thus on account of the its velocity, a satellite clock appears to run slow by 7 microseconds per day when compared to a clock on the earth’s surface. But on account of the difference in gravitational potential, the satellite clock appears to run fast by 45 microseconds per day. The net effect is that the clock appears to run fast by 38 microseconds per day. This is an enormous rate difference for an atomic clock with a precision of a few nanoseconds. Thus to compensate for this large secular rate, the clocks are given a rate offset prior to satellite launch of - 4.465 parts in 1010 from their nominal frequency of 10.23 MHz so that on average they appear to run at the same rate as a clock on the ground. The actual frequency of the satellite clocks before launch is thus 10.22999999543 MHz.<p>Although the GPS satellite orbits are nominally circular, there is always some residual eccentricity. The eccentricity causes the orbit to be slightly elliptical, and the velocity and altitude vary over one revolution. Thus, although the principal velocity and gravitational effects have been compensated by a rate offset, there remains a slight residual variation that is proportional to the eccentricity. For example, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.02 there is a relativistic sinusoidal variation in the apparent clock time having an amplitude of 46 nanoseconds. This correction must be calculated and taken into account in the GPS receiver.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve had a chance to speak with a few engineers from Motorola that worked on GPS and a very interesting fellow that worked on GLONASS all of them said that they had a tuned atomic clock and everything was done on the receiving end and for the most part the clocks on the satellites could not be even corrected after they were initialized.",1455018543

Being natural doesn&#x27;t make it good, but it does mean policies and expectations should be realistic. Singapore has achieved racial integration by very authoritarian measures like deciding where you can live and who your neighbors are, which was and is a realistic policy given the alternative outcome of just about everywhere else of racial groups bunching together against the outer culture which ends up causing various problems for the local government. In the absence of negative reinforcement like demonizing people who don&#x27;t at least appear welcoming to transpeople in the same way racists are demonized (this is the way I predict things going, sadly), and in the absence of well-enforced top-down measures, expectations should be for a long slog towards grudging acceptance of the state of the world.<p>I dream of a more grand future where I can just rewrite my personality(ies) to feel differently about various things, even to rewrite my brain and form a new body to experience what it&#x27;s truly like to be female, or Hutu.

I worked with PHP about 15 years ago, left for other platforms but occasionally had to deal with PHP, and since the last year I couch a team of PHP developers, so it&#x27;s part of my daily life understanding the language and it&#x27;s quirks. My honest opinion is that PHP didn&#x27;t change at all over the years. All the same bad smells are there, but not at the same places. The best description I&#x27;ve seen for this is in that old &quot;fractal of bad design&quot; post:<p>> &quot;PHP is a community of amateurs. Very few people designing it, working on it, or writing code in it seem to know what they’re doing. Those who do grow a clue tend to drift away to other platforms, reducing the average competence of the whole. This, right here, is the biggest problem with PHP: it is absolutely the blind leading the blind.&quot;<p>This is so true it hurts, and unfortunately if you think &quot;it&#x27;s not like that, every platform has goods and bads, php works for me, yadda yadda yadda&quot; you&#x27;re in the amateur group. You need to work with other platforms for real to understand this. It&#x27;s not &quot;every platform has issues&quot;, it&#x27;s more like &quot;every platform has issues, and then there is php, in a different category with much deeper problems&quot;.<p>This is not about preferences or tastes either. It&#x27;s just about looking around and seeing how common problems have already been solved. PHP7 has good exceptions, yay! Except they should have been there for 20 years. It was already a <i>very solid concept</i> back when PHP 1.0 was released. ES3 implemented exceptions correctly in 99 for god&#x27;s sake. Every other language did too, PHP is the only kid in the block that took 20 years to understand what exceptions are supposed to mean in the language.<p>I could point other small things like the new DateTime API being a joke, mysqli is still supported and still converts typed data to strings, terrible encoding support, pure byte strings instead of unicode strings, inconsistencies in implementations between OSs, the compiler still acting differently depending on php.ini settings, but in the end, it all boils down to bad design.<p>Facebook&#x27;s Hack fixes the PHP language for real in strict mode, and that is the work of real engineers thinking about stuff. PHP7 is still the same old people trying to get around without looking at proven solutions anywhere else.<p>And that&#x27;s why you can&#x27;t design good code with PHP7. It&#x27;s like trying to design a good house made of turd. Doesn&#x27;t matter how much you design it, in the end it will still smell terrible.",1455017478

For years it was THE gaming/video site for me.<p>I remember thinking back in early 2012 how GT is just throwing their success away. The site was super stagnant for years it felt like, tech-wise. No new features, no bugs getting fixed, spam starting to get out of control in the comments. They failed to jump on the HD bandwagon with their video player - their supposed core competency! Yes they had direct link HD video downloads earlier than most and that&#x27;s how I originally found the site. However in 2013 their video player still couldn&#x27;t even play 720p, while other sites including YouTube had easy HD playback without having to download any files. [1]<p>In the summer of 2012 they launched a rather major redesign of their site. I guess this is the reason why the site wasn&#x27;t maintained technically for years before, the developers were focusing on their secret hidden branch. Unfortunately while the new design had better aesthetics, it was far worse feature-wise. First of all, they completely cut a ton of major features from the site, including user uploaded videos, which had been a major community feature. Plenty of features they didn&#x27;t remove got seriously downgraded. One of the primary reasons I stopped visiting was because they completely ruined discovery. Previously it was possible to easily see new videos sorted by date uploaded, with the possibility of additional filters like platforms. With the new redesign, there were only like four editor picks in a carousel wheel and some other random videos in a list, but no sort-by-date options. [2]<p>The real canary in the coal mine event happened in January of 2013, when their editor in chief Shane Satterfield left, stating that he didn&#x27;t agree with the direction the company was being taken to. [3] Things started going downhill fast after this, content-wise. While before it was mostly technical problems and the content was great, this didn&#x27;t last long without Shane.<p>Later on in 2014 GT got sold and 2/3 of their staff was fired, including important veteran employees. I had already stopped visiting by this moment, and I guess plenty of others had well, hence the layoffs. 2015 brought even more firings, and it seems 2016 now finally brought closure.<p>In conclusion, I feel like GT died mostly because of incompetent top management, failing to properly adapt to changes.<p>--<p>[1] Looking at the site today, it seems they finally added 720p playback sometime between 2014 and 2016.<p>[2] Looking at the site today, it seems they&#x27;ve improved the discovery after I left at the end of 2013.<p>[3] Shane has since started his own gaming site, SIFTD. He has even managed to snatch some key shows from GT, like Pachter Factor. <a href=""http://siftd.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://siftd.net/</a>",1455016146

Massive incumbent organisations can take advantage of their own innovations as they have sufficient mass to sustain a lengthy adoption cycle, and can afford the capital outlay. This builds vast multi-sector monopolies which self-sustain and block out competition through sheer inertia. As time progresses the incentives to innovate decrease for these guys, as they own the entire market, so need not compete on utility, nor even price.<p>Smaller incumbent organisations, however, end up saddled with technical debt, and the only way out for them is tabula rasa - i.e. to write off sunk costs, and start with new tech - or go bust.<p>New organisations start with a blank slate, and can thrive for a while - but unless they have a strong strategy for stemming technical debt, they end up as a &quot;smaller incumbent organisation&quot;.<p>This boom-bust cycle of profitability followed by obsolescence accelerates as the evolution of new technology accelerates, and the overheads and complexity of adoption increase. Complexity increases as the sum total of moving parts in society and technology always grows, and overheads increase as more advanced technologies tend to require a larger capital outlay to implement.<p>Where this leads is ultimately to a deadlock type situation, where innovation ceases to be profitable as adoption is too slow to allow a new tech to flourish before it is superseded, and ultimately stagnation, and collapse.<p>So... if I had to point to one thing that could make a <i>big</i> difference to how the global economy functions, it would be a complete revamp of patent law around the globe. I&#x27;d love to also think that we could move away from the idea that Everyone Must Work, and actually start to realise the benefits of the vastly increased efficiencies of the last several centuries, but the ideology is so entrenched at this point that the only thing likely to allow a change will be outright collapse of our current system of the world.",1455015853

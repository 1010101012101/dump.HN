Motorola cases also recently demonstrated that vague garbage patents are much more useful in court than technological patents. Juries and judges understand them better and are inclined to award hundreds of times more damages.<p>I don&#x27;t think that I agree with this part especially if you are equating Standards Essential Patents with &quot;technological patents&quot; and all other patents as &quot;vague garbage patents&quot;. If that wasn&#x27;t what you meant I misunderstood.<p>The reason that SEP are worth less (than other valid patents) and not entitled to injunctions is because commitments were entered into by their owners to enable them to be included in the standard.

So one may try to understand what&#x27;s all this focus on getting it right the first time when the topic is programming? I mean, it is not a good idea to do the first silly thing, but something that looks pretty sane after some non trivial analysis, is probably a good path.

(The RAF knew its flight plan in advance, so they sent a particularly &quot;hot&quot; Lightning F.3 out over the Atlantic: it tanked up, climbed on a ballistic trajectory, and bounced the SR-71 from above and behind.

7366489,comment,7365382,7366444,1,0,_delirium,,,"The reason for that is that under the prevailing caselaw, companies can&#x27;t be &quot;inventors&quot; of things, and therefore they don&#x27;t fit under the clause of the U.S. Constitution that authorizes patents, which specifically mentions securing exclusive rights to an invention to its &quot;inventor&quot;. Hence the legal dance where the inventors (specific humans who invented something) are named in the patent, but then they assign their exclusive right to the invention to another legal entity (their employer).<p>I think that might be a bit of a historical anomaly, though, related to when different doctrines were developed. Nowadays legal personhood is personhood-enough for most areas of law. One could imagine a court in 2014, looking at this issue for the first time, deciding that when a company puts a bunch of R&D money into something, and an invention results, through the actions of perhaps dozens of people working within the company&#x27;s structures and facilities, it is in effect the company as an aggregate entity that has invented the invention. That might even fit a bit better (though still imperfectly) with modern scientific/historical understanding of invention, which generally views single-person &quot;eureka!&quot; moments as the exception, and collaborative efforts where some R&D &quot;system&quot; can be reasonably credited with the invention as the norm.<p>But this particular body of law was settled back in the days when the prevailing legal fiction around corporations was a bit different, so only humans can legally invent things. Due to the common dance around assignment, it doesn&#x27;t make much practical difference anyway.",1394314739

In CPython 2.7.5, the list comprehension<p><pre><code>    [doc for doc in all_docs if doc not in results]\n</code></pre>\ngenerates this bytecode (output by the dis module):<p><pre><code>          0 BUILD_LIST               0\n          3 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (all_docs)\n          6 GET_ITER\n    >>    7 FOR_ITER                24 (to 34)\n         10 STORE_FAST               0 (doc)\n         13 LOAD_FAST                0 (doc)\n         16 LOAD_GLOBAL              1 (results)\n         19 COMPARE_OP               7 (not in)\n         22 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE        7\n         25 LOAD_FAST                0 (doc)\n         28 LIST_APPEND              2\n         31 JUMP_ABSOLUTE            7\n         34 (whatever comes next in the program)\n</code></pre>\nLet&#x27;s go through it. Instruction 0 (BUILD_LIST) makes an empty list and puts it on the stack. Instruction 3 (LOAD_GLOBAL) does a global variable lookup and puts it on the stack. (If this occurs in a function it would be a local variable lookup, but this isn&#x27;t important.) Then we start iterating over an iterable with GET_ITER and FOR_ITER. In the body of the loop we use STORE_FAST to set the topmost stack value to a local variable &quot;doc&quot;, then LOAD_FAST to grab its value and put it atop the stack, then LOAD_GLOBAL to get &quot;results&quot;, then evaluate the &quot;not in&quot; with a single COMPARISON_OP bytecode, then either go to the beginning of the loop, or load doc onto the stack again and then append it to the list we&#x27;re building. And then go to the beginning of the loop.<p>Now, let&#x27;s compare with the obvious non-list-comprehension version:<p><pre><code>    docs = []\n    for doc in all_docs:\n        if doc not in results:\n            docs.append(doc)\n</code></pre>\nThis generates some similar bytecode:<p><pre><code>         0 BUILD_LIST               0\n         3 STORE_FAST               0 (docs)\n\n         6 SETUP_LOOP              42 (to 51)\n         9 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (all_docs)\n        12 GET_ITER\n   >>   13 FOR_ITER                34 (to 50)\n        16 STORE_FAST               1 (doc)\n\n        19 LOAD_FAST                1 (doc)\n        22 LOAD_GLOBAL              1 (results)\n        25 COMPARE_OP               7 (not in)\n        28 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE       13\n\n        31 LOAD_FAST                0 (docs)\n        34 LOAD_ATTR                2 (append)\n        37 LOAD_FAST                1 (doc)\n        40 CALL_FUNCTION            1\n        43 POP_TOP\n        44 JUMP_ABSOLUTE           13\n        47 JUMP_ABSOLUTE           13\n   >>   50 POP_BLOCK\n   >>   51 (whatever comes next in the program)\n</code></pre>\nThe main difference here is that there&#x27;s a lot more loading and saving of variables (e.g. the &quot;docs&quot; variable which was implicit in the list comprehension version), and things like the docs.append() method have to be loaded each time through the loop and then called, which slows things down some compared to using a single LIST_APPEND opcode.<p>I&#x27;m not really going anywhere with this; I just think that interpreter internals are fun.",1394314684

7366473,comment,7365382,7365382,15,0,bluedevil2k,,,"There&#x27;s a lot of guessing and conjecture about how IBM deals with patents, so I thought I&#x27;d write a new parent thread to discuss.<p>I worked at IBM for 7 years, leaving many years ago.  I am an IBM Master Inventor, having 36 patents filed with the USPTO with my name on them (some are still winding their way through the system).  I worked heavily on patents for 3 years, and the last 2 years I was there, I was on the Patent Review Board.  I&#x27;d also estimate during my active time with patents, I submitted 250-300 patent ideas to the board.<p>The Patent Review Board is organized along technologies - so, mobile would have its own Patent Review Board.  People on the Patent Review Board tend to be Master Inventors and others who are active in the patent process.  Once a week, about 3-4 hours of presentations are made to the Board (which includes the patent lawyers as well).  After a 5-10 minute presentation, they are asked to leave the room, and the Board votes whether it should continue to the lawyer, or whether to close it.  Most obviously are closed at this step with prior art.  If it&#x27;s voted to go to the lawyers, in my background, there was a pretty good chance it was going to get filed.<p>If your patent got filed with the USPTO, you got a point.  IBM is very generous with their patent bonuses.  You get $750 per patent filed.  You also get an additional $1500 on your first patent filing, and $1500 every 3 after that.  So, effectively, about $1000 per patent.<p>Patent ideas could be anything and everything.  If they could patent it, they would.  I remember from my time on the board seeing ideas on everything from dog doors to server optimization techniques to music devices.  Given the people who work at IBM, most tended to be tech related, but it definitely was not a requirement at all.<p>The stuff people have asked about royalties makes me laugh as well - I never got the feeling once they cared if your patent would make them $1B or $1.  And they certainly didn&#x27;t care about compensating us for an idea that could make $1B.  I was awarded the Software Group Patent of the Year one year, and other than an email denoting that fact, nothing was different than some of the lame ones I had filed.<p>Overall though, I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the patent process at IBM - it was one of the few outlets that rewarded creativity and hard work at the company.",1394314515

But by the time the SR-71 came into service, that era was over, having ended in 1960 with the shooting down of a U-2 (an earlier Kelly Johnson Skunkworks creation) over Sverdlovsk. Of course, although the U-2 flew at altitudes comparable to the SR-71, it was subsonic. Arguably, the Blackbird&#x27;s much greater speed would have made it harder to shoot down, but with spy satellites available, the Americans didn&#x27;t want to push their luck.<p>Prof. Sergei Nikitich Khrushchev, who became a US citizen in 1999 and whose father was General Secretary at the time, wrote a detailed inside account† of the U-2 shoot down. By the time of the shoot-down, U-2s had been overflying the Soviet Union since 1956. Prof. Khrushchev wrote, &quot;After the first U-2 flight, Father felt the Americans must be chortling over our impotence.&quot;<p>In addition to the U-2, Soviet air defense bagged a MiG-19, piloted by Lt. Sergei Safronov, who managed to bail out but died of his injuries. The incident occurred on May Day 1960, a big Soviet holiday, and it seems they were too drunk to change the transponder codes from April, causing the radars to misidentify the MiG as hostile.<p>†<a href=""http://www.americanheritage.com/content/day-we-shot-down-u-2?page=show"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americanheritage.com/content/day-we-shot-down-u-2...</a>",1394314214

But, if your computer is exploited the exploiter could still obtain your brain wallet if you use it on that computer. Cold storage of your private keys, protected with a passphrase, on a couple of USB flash drives in two locations seems the obvious choice for safely protecting your cryptocurrency. Yes, there are still potential exploits.

Don&#x27;t ask your friends, they&#x27;ll almost always say yes. If you don&#x27;t have direct access to someone who would potentially use your service, use an online survey (SurveyMonkey, for example) to sample your audience. The most important question you should be asking yourself right now is &quot;Why would someone want this?&quot; You&#x27;re not your own customer.<p>2) Use your network and get intros. The chances of someone responding to you are much higher when you&#x27;re connected by a mutual (and trusted) 3rd party.<p>3) You should have two pitch decks. The 1-2 minute pitch, and the 5-10 minute pitch. The 1-2 minute pitch deck gets attention. The 5-10 minute pitch deck tells what, why and how in more detail. You should also highlight yourself, and why you&#x27;re the expert in this area.<p>4) If you don&#x27;t have something built, at the very least have very detailed and polished wireframes. Ideally something that&#x27;s interactive.<p>This is basically a mashup of how to raise money and how to pitch and sell your product (since you seem to be focusing on acquiring a client who will pay you to build this solution vs pitching to a VC in order to build a company).<p>If you (or you and some friends) can build an MVP, do that and give it to someone you know to use (most startups are more willing to try out these types of products, especially if you know the founders). If it&#x27;s a good idea, and it works, you now have &#x27;proof&#x27; that&#x27;s actionable (mainly, numbers/metrics and user feedback).<p>Also, you should be able to explain how this is going to help company X. Are you going to increase productivity by 50%? Are you going to lower costs by 25%? You should be able to explain, with fluency, what you&#x27;re optimizing and the analysis behind that (that may be in the form of P&L analysis, for example).<p>Most engineers going into this get hung up on the how. Companies rarely care how (although again, this should be in your pitch deck) you&#x27;re going to build this because they have little or no technical background. They just want to know why your thing is better than the thing they have, or the things they thought about using/buying.<p>BTW, don&#x27;t say you _think_ you can help employees save the company time/money. Say that you can definitively save the company time/money by making process X for their employees Y times easier/cheaper. Use real numbers that show real gain. Make a very simple to understand chart/graph.",1394313365

Here, when you are passing a pointer, it&#x27;s going to be a pointer to an object on the stack which is always going to be good - the pointer argument shows you that you are dealing with something outside the functions local scope, the variable allows you pass information back, etc.<p>Qt also has used its own smart pointers for a while but these generally are declared within some container class, so the idiom basically allows you to do allocation entirely within containers and so never use the new operator directly.<p>Now, there may be situations where you have a complex chain of multiple connections that don&#x27;t fit to an existing container. The sloppy way then is to use new and the good way to write a custom container. The idiom can also when dealing external libraries that allocate memory directly or somehow demand you use the new operator.",1394312786

They outright bought a set of patents in the hope that Twitter&#x27;s own new portfolio would be enough to discourage other companies from suing Twitter in the future.<p>Defensive portfolios of garbage patents used to be the key to preventing competitors from suing you with their garbage patents. After the eBay v. MercExchange [0] case in 2006, it&#x27;s not as dangerous to be sued but defensive portfolios are now much less useful also because you can&#x27;t threaten to shut down aggressors&#x27; businesses with injunctions. The Apple v. Samsung and Microsoft v. Motorola cases also recently demonstrated that vague garbage patents are much more useful in court than technological patents. Juries and judges understand them better and are inclined to award hundreds of times more damages.<p>Second, IBM is the least awful kind of patent troll. They generally ask for small fractions of revenue or investment in companies that have established themselves. The IPO phase is a favorite time for them to ask for a few million from growing companies. The worst kind of trolls -- such as Microsoft&#x27;s Intellectual Ventures -- ask for much more money from companies and often go after startups. IBM exercises restraint with the idea that they might have an ongoing relationship with companies someday in some other context.<p>And IBM, unlike most trolls, actually does real research. Most of the new ideas in Google Search were first published in an IBM research paper that Larry and Sergei read. IBM didn&#x27;t patent those ideas, though; they mostly seem to accumulate scattershot patents at random. I think IBM&#x27;s primary goal is to top the list of prolific grantees every year.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay_Inc._v._MercExchange,_L.L.C"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay_Inc._v._MercExchange,_L.L....</a>.",1394312700

4204361,comment,4203610,4204281,15,0,tptacek,,,"Disagree. With possibly a few exceptions, secure software development is led by the breakers, not the builders. Some of the best of the breakers start out as competent builders, but either way: you can't defend something if you don't understand how it's going to be attacked, and the history of software security over the last 20 years suggests that we <i>suck</i> at predicting what attackers will come up with. Great example: ""buffer overflows are easy to fix; just make the stack non-executable"".<p>One of the best secure developers in the world is Daniel J. Bernstein, and, two things you'd want to know about DJB: (i) he missed LP64 integer overflows, which got flagged by (pure breaker) Georgey Guninski, and (ii) he's a world-class cryptanalyst and breaker in his own right.<p>There's a reasonable ""builders vs. breakers"" argument to be had, I'm sure, but my experience suggests that overwhelmingly the people making this ""world needs more builders and less breakers"" point are people who are annoyed at the prospect of sinking the time into becoming a competitive breaker.",1341514262

Windows 7 has one taskbar, and so it becomes extremely difficult/near impossible to quickly determine which window is on which screen. This could be improved by adding a second taskbar (I think this is coming in Windows 8?) but I think more is needed.<p>Additionally: some application titlebars can be dragged so the window appears on a different screen, but some cannot. Excel, when maximized, cannot be dragged to another screen.<p>Back to taskbar issues: My biggest complain pre-Windows 7 was that you could not reorder items. I thought they fixed it, but they actually made it a lot more annoying with W7. I think Windows assumes that each window of an application is related to the other windows (<i>never</i> the case with my workflow) and so you cannot separate them by dragging. Say I have 5 Firefox windows with a few tabs each, where each window's tabs represent a collection of related topics. Now say I have some Word and Excel documents also open that relate to the browser windows. I'd like to arrange Topic 1 from Firefox, Word and Excel on one monitor with their taskbar items together, Topic 2 on the second monitor with their items together, etc. It's very unpleasant and difficult to manage windows on Windows.",1341513965

Specifically, ""Linux"" vs ""some other operating system"".<p>I agree that advances in computing must surely have a lot to do with the discovery of the Higgs, but such advances are about hardware, not operating systems. Since the 1990s, billions of dollars, both public and private, have been spent to keep Moore's Law rolling forward, and that's most of what makes modern computers more capable.<p>Anyway, it occurs to me that this discussion is a classic bikeshed. Rather than debate tricky and obscure issues like the quantum mechanics behind the Higgs phenomenon, the engineering of supercolliders, the politics of getting supercolliders funded, the ins and outs of data processing algorithms at CERN, or the techniques of manufacturing transistors with a 20nm gate size, we have fallen back to debating whether or not the license used for the operating system was vitally important.<p>If CERN had had to implement a Unix entirely from scratch in order to do their job, they would have done so. It would have been a minor side issue. Indeed, from a certain point of view, that may be exactly what they did. Why discuss how Linux was vital for CERN's scientists, but not the other way around? Perhaps the reason why Linux was so good for high-energy physics is that <i>high-energy physicists built it that way</i>?",1341513840

A system for synchronizing the presentation of data on a digital computer display, comprising:<p>first and second window-controlling means, each of said window-controlling means displaying information in at least one display window,\na synchronization control means, and\nmeans for communications between said synchronization control means and each of said first and second window-controlling means;\nwherein said first window-controlling means displays first information from a first source, and said second window-controlling means displays second information from a second source;\nwherein said first information and said second information have sections, and at least one section of said second information corresponds to a section of said first information;\nwherein said first window-controlling means sends a message to said synchronization control means over said means for communications indicating a change in viewing position to a new section of said first information;\nwherein said synchronization control means sends a message to said second window-controlling means over said means for communications requesting a change in viewing position to a section of said second information corresponding to said new section of said first information; and\nwherein said second window-controlling means displays said corresponding section of said second information on at least one display window.</i><p>Remember, patents cover <i>methods</i>, not <i>purposes</i>.  This patent covers <i>a specific method</i> for displaying data in multiple windows, not the general concept of displaying data in multiple windows.<p>Mind you, I still think it's a dumb patent.  But let's make sure we understand what we're lynching them for before we get out the torches and pitchforks, ok?",1341513788

Most importantly, the reason for the acquisition, and the fact who company B wants/needs to make happy:<p>The reasons might be a) fire sale, b) talent acquisition, c) product/asset buy, or d) merger (increasing value of the company from a to d).<p>in a) it will most likely go only to the investors, so scenario 1 in your case. The founders will probably not even transition, as only the assets are bought to be re-used by company B. Founders don't get money or stock, as they haven't built a successful company, yadda yadda (that's what liq prefs are for).<p>in b) the acquiring company will most likely want to keep the founders happy, not the investors. Like a), it's often not the best performing business, but B wants A's team to work for them. The investors will be made happy, and the founders will either receive stock outright, or get great employment contracts with lots of options. Recently, it seems to have happened more often that investors didn't end up getting lots of the proceeds, but founders were very handsomely rewarded afterwards (on a trust basis). The Milk acquisition by Google seems to have happened like that (according to le bloggers), and there's word about many more instances where the investors got screwed by handshake agreements that turned into a nice payout for the entrepreneur afterwards. This is again not a question of good vs evil, but simply a question of who has control of the deal. This situation is now finding the way into legal docs (I am sure the lawyers can weigh in).<p>c) is the most obvious case for your solution - company B wants to make everybody happy so the investors agree to a sale, and the founders stay on as employees of the acquiring company. But again, this depends on who the decision power lies with, and who needs to get a sale, fast. Because the company is a much smaller part of the resulting company, control needs to be ceded (depending on the A-investors' power).<p>in d), the investors of company A will probably want to keep control of their stock. If it is a merger of equals, this control would have to be granted, because they would otherwise not agree to a sale.<p>On top of that, there are other things to consider:<p>- How is the acquisition paid for? You assume new stock, but it might be part cash, part options from an existing pool, part share transfers from other shareholders...\n- What are the pay out horizons for individual investors and shareholders (especially if angels or a complicated structure is involved)<p>Fascinating topic.",1341513641

4204304,comment,4203806,4204018,4,0,Spearchucker,,,"Agreed! Most emphatically so, in fact.<p>I've been an ""architect"" since 2001 and the thing that slaps me in the face again and again is that most architects I encounter can't code, or haven't bothered to for years.<p>First, the word architect is just a fancy word for design. And yet most architects don't know the difference between a layer and a tier. The best way to get your head around those concepts is to write code using separation of concerns, and deploying it. Yourself.<p>Next, process. Seriously? Process was solved in the 80's. The agile movement brings nothing new here. There's a basic process that starts way before you write code -<p>Envision (your idea)<p>Plan (how)<p>Build (write the code - you can use SCRUM et al here if that's your bag)<p>Stabilise (bug fix - if your dev methodology permits then this merges with build, but an architect/project manager/program manager should still identify milestones for release readiness)<p>Deploy<p>Operate<p>Companies like Thoughtworks (whom I admire for their technical ability) will tell you to screw any process, and that the software will evolve itself. This is bad, because it will result in an app that's never finished.<p>So as an architect remember to begin with the end in mind. There's no point in starting if you don't know how to know that you've finished.<p>If process is new to you, check out version 3.1 of Microsoft's Solution Framework. Both the team and process models are good, but neither are gospel.<p>Stay VERY VERY far away from frameworks like TOGAF. They're a prime example of how to kill a project through process. The Zachman Framework is only good as a documentation guide, but offers little that the Microsoft Solutions Framework doesn't cover. The Unified Process, or whatever that crazy process is called that came out of the UML world is just as bloated and useless.<p>In closing, if you want to be a good architect, learn to code better than anyone else you work with. Be that guy that's done it all and has the war stories to prove a point, like why server push won't work on an ADSL network.<p>And don't call yourself an architect. You design software. That's kind of it.",1341513505

Tool generated code is so common in those communities most code is generally taken care by the IDE. Import statements, exception handling, try/catch blocks, loop generation in context of previous statements. The list endless...<p>Because that code can be easily automated... choosing not to is just wasting your time.<p>>>When you are tuned to thinking this way you basically lose any touch on proactive coding. You stop thinking, the IDE starts thinking for you. You stop reading API because you know everything is about to be auto completed, anyway. Now the issue is you are offloading the job of thinking to the IDE. This is dangerous.<p>False.  You stop thinking about boilerplate code and API details and free yourself to focus on the actual problem at hand.<p>>>If a rookie can do what an expert can, just by using an IDE. I guess its time for the expert to fear for his job.<p>Do you consider writing good code an issue of speed typing?  I have no idea why you believe an IDE would be able to make a beginner into an expert.<p>>>Lack of knowledge of command line utils is just one such case. You can either learn how to use awk/sed/Perl + Text processing utils. Or you can open up eclipse and endlessly re implement what the command line has to already offer.<p>Or you could use your IDE to write something that the command line doesn't do.  Nice strawman.<p>I can never understand why people who are in the business of automating tasks (programmers) hate tools that automate tasks (IDE's), of all things.",1341511253

Moreover, all cases are recorded, so you can request a transcript of the whole process. Most judicial decisions however begin by a summary of the facts and the laws that were in question.<p>Once you get a decision, you can fix it. You appeal it. If the court was wrong, then the higher court is likely to overturn it.<p>The point about being able to read the judicial decision is that if the judge applied the law incorrectly, whether because he was corrupted, because he did not like the defendant or anything, if you are a trained lawyer, you can see that the law was applied incorrectly, so you appeal it. If that appeal is successful, the judge below would loose a huge amount of reputation, especially if it was blatantly obvious that he applied the law incorrectly. So no judge would do it. They are paid very handsomely. They probably practised as lawyers before becoming a judge so made quite a bit and therefore they have nothing to gain and everything to loose if they accept being corrupted.",1341511226

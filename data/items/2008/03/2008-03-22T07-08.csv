That is, one ""user"" could in fact be a single user, or it could represent a collaboration between any number of known or unknown users. (Even if you don't like it, people would still manage to do it this way somehow. May as well make it easy to exchange/publish keys to other users on the site.)<p>Alternately, one could sign a modification of an article rather than the article itself, allowing for one of the greatest benefits of Wikipedia: the three thousand pedants correcting everyone else's spelling, grammar, punctuation and word usage.",1206172779

Its target audience was authors, tabletop RPG players, and people who like both soap operas and virtual pets. The main interaction was a sort of interview where <i>users</i> submitted to a pool of questions, then <i>characters</i> (to which each user had a one-to-many relationship) volunteered answers for them--I entitled it ""Phase 1: Direct Characterization.""<p>Phase 2 would obviously character interaction, but I never got to that point.",1206172088

For just one obvious problem, other people ""own"" messages you post to their wall (they get the deletion rights to them, not you.)

Joined a small company in Los Angeles, transferred my H1 there. My GC process was restarted.
Finally received my green card in the end of the last year. It took me almost 7 years.
I have MS in Economics and PhD in CS from foreign universities.",1206171686

143185,comment,143148,143148,0,0,andreyf,,,"The essay does take advantage over the common ""naturalistic fallacy"", where people imply something as being ""good"" from its being ""natural"". As a simple counterexample, many diseases are ""natural"" and many antibiotics, not.<p>However, I think it's only fair that Paul's motivation for some of his essays is, at least in part, PR work for YC, and hence the fibs (that being the harshest word I'd use) are understandable.",1206171327

143183,comment,143148,143174,0,0,bumbledraven,,,"I don't think so. This comment by Peter on the original article summed it up well:<p>""What gets PG's goat, it seems, is that relatively privileged, smart, hard-working kids should want to participate in this awful existence known as 'the 9 to 5', rather than strike out on their own and attempt to do something great -- possibly something even world-changing. And watching these clones root around some cookie-cutter downtown Palo Alto cafe performing some absurd exercise is more than he can stand. These kids could _be_ something -- they could _do_ something, but instead, some nutjob decided it'd be cool to send them on some wacky easter egg hunt. They could be busy trying to save the world, but instead, they're busying conditioning their brains to be subservient to the dictatorship that is modern corporations.""",1206171218
143182,comment,143148,143148,0,0,cperciva,,,"Jeff Atwood could certainly have made his case in a better way, but I think he has a point here.<p>There are many perfectly legitimate reasons for working at a large company; family responsibilities (yes, there are mid-twenties and early-thirties programmers with a spouse and children), a chronic medical condition (if I were living in the US, my medical bills would be upwards of $20k/year, and I know I'm not alone), or being dedicated to a non-economically-profitable pursuit (if you want to spend 2 months a year volunteering in sub-Saharan Africa, many employers will let you have the time off -- a startup won't) are a few possibilities.  Comparing people who decide to work for a large company to caged animals, and suggesting that they are ""ten times [less] alive"" is condescending, and ignores the fact that they might seem far more lively when they are with their families or pursuing whatever activities they enjoy -- or that if they worked for a startup, they might not be able to afford the medicine which keeps them alive.<p>I consider myself fortunate that I can do something I enjoy and have a reasonable chance of making money doing it; but not everybody is so lucky, and we should not insult such unfortunates by suggesting that they made poor choices or are somehow behaving unnaturally.",1206171130

Of course you've read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  If I ever did a startup, the whole point would be to earn enough money to open something like that, or maybe a toy company.  I'd want enough money that I wouldn't have to bow to market forces and could make candy and toys that are actually good (Lego RIP).",1206170545

I actually see it as a wider condition.<p><i>You Weren't Meant to Have a Boss</i> has a very specific ""you"" in mind: the kind of people who are aching to become founders (well, obviously). That's in no way a bad thing, but it is worth noting that earlier essays by pg had a wider audience.<p>It's not narcissism, it's focus. It's a symptom of ""nearly all the programmers I know are startup founders"".",1206170052

And I also hope (for my own sake) that for most people the matter at hand is trying to suppress self-gratuity in their writing, rather than not having it in the first place.",1206169600

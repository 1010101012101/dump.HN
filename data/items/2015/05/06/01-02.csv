9496174,comment,9494472,9494472,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Much of what keeps programmer salaries from going up as fast as they should is that managers know that, even if you&#x27;re a genuine &quot;10x&quot; or even 100x engineer, you don&#x27;t <i>stay</i> a 10x-er unless you get interesting projects, which tend to be rare in most companies. Since they control the allocation of interesting work, there&#x27;s often an implied either/or: you can get interesting work and a cost-of-living bump <i>or</i> you can get a 20% raise.<p>For some examples: (1) frequent job hops can improve your salary, but they reduce your ability to stick with a long project and become good at anything; (2) if you&#x27;re looking to make the case for a move into management, you do better to take on an ugly-but-necessary project where you&#x27;ll delegate most of the work, than to stick with the technically interesting stuff and get a reputation of someone who only wants to work on the &quot;fun&quot; stuff; (3) Haskell engineers make about 40% less than Java engineers at the same level of engineering ability. (The difference in medians is only a few percent, but the median Haskell engineer is equivalent to ~95th percentile in Java.) That&#x27;s because Java engineers can set up multilateral bidding wars every 2 years and get huge pay bumps; in Haskell, that&#x27;s nearly impossible because it&#x27;s a small community.<p>Personally, I tend to go for interesting work. That&#x27;s because I think, in the long term, it&#x27;ll play out better for me to have spent my 30s well than to have ratcheted up my salary but not really know anything.<p>If we want to see engineers paid what they&#x27;re worth, though, we&#x27;ve got to get political enough that we can actually run companies (let&#x27;s be honest; 98+ percent of VC-funded startups are run by Guys With Connections Who Therefore Call Shots, not engineers) and take control of the work allocation processes as well.",1430877471

For context, I disagree with Bootstrap&#x27;s framework design decisions, our app had a 3000-line CSS override file, and we wanted to make our two-year-old web app responsive, so we decided to gut Bootstrap entirely. The process took a few months, including a whole redesign process.<p>For an existing app, you can&#x27;t just remove bootstrap and put in something new. As you probably realize by now, everything will just break.<p>Instead, you need to update individual pages along the way. This process is preferable to removing bootstrap and re-implementing your pages all in one giant pull request since it allows your team to QA iteratively.<p>For us, we redesigned our app, made it responsive, and also used another library in addition to removing Bootstrap. There was a lot more nuance involved, but for example, I started first by redoing the header and footer, then I moved onto individual pages. You can probably just start by re-implementing common mixins and modules first. Then you can move onto the actual templates and start removing your .rows and .span divs page-by-page.<p>I wrote about the process in depth here: <a href=""https://medium.com/anyperk-product-engineering/anyperks-responsive-design-overhaul-with-bourbon-and-neat-8fd487bbce03"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/anyperk-product-engineering/anyperks-resp...</a>",1430877047

9496145,comment,9493926,9493926,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>Why was this process so smooth? The team had never worked together before, and the scenes they were shooting that day required many different complex tasks to happen in harmony: lighting, makeup, hair, costumes, sets, props, acting. And yet there was no transition time; everybody worked together seamlessly, instantly.</i><p>Because it was planned in pre-production. When you decide to shoot a film, the first thing that happens is the script gets &#x27;broken down&#x27; into a database with every single production element involved in every scene. I mean everything - if a character has a handbag over her shoulder and later pulls a tube of lipstick out of it, the lipstick and the handbag get their own pages in the breakdown, they&#x27;re linked with each other, someone is assigned the responsibility to procure, pay, maintain custody of it, and so on...and on and on and on. Your typical feature film has maybe 100 scenes, and even a no-budget film will probably generate an average of 10 things per scene. On a big-budget film as described in the article, it could be 10x that.<p>This process takes 1-2 weeks minimum, and forms the basis of the budget and the schedule. Then you add in constraints for this and that (Famous Actress is only available for one week, so all her scenes will have be shot between these two dates; we&#x27;ll have X hours and minutes of daylight available on any given date; union rules mean that if we shoot longer than 16 hours in a single day we start paying everyone their full day rate for each additional hour (yes that&#x27;s really true, but it hardly ever happens). So at the end of this you have a realistic estimate of time and cost for the production itself. You end up with a document called the &#x27;Day Out of Days&#x27; which itemizes every single scene and possibly every single camera setup in the film, and what particular things/people will be required for them.<p>Then you set about raising the money, and when you have all that in place you go into pre-rpoduction, securing locations, building props, getting signatures on contracts and so on. Things falling through at this stage can cause big delays (on reason that I&#x27;m reading HN today rather than shooting) but most contracts go into effect on the first day of principal photography so the financial costs are limited.<p>During production, everyone on the cast and crew gets a copy of the schedule for the following day the evening before, telling them where they&#x27;ll be working, what they&#x27;ll be doing, what stuff has to be there etc. etc. This usually undergoes substantial revisions at the end of every shooting day depending on whether production is ahead of or behind schedule, what random things have changed and so on. You work for 12+ hours a day, and everything you do is scheduled down to 15 minute increments. Then you drink a beer and either go home or sit in a production meeting for 1-2 hours and work out the potential problems for the following day.<p>Think of it as a cross between military logistics of setting up a forward operating base (minus the risk of being shot at) and planning a wedding. It&#x27;s great, it&#x27;s really rewarding, but like these events it is a ton of hard work and you probably go to bed mentally and physically exhausted every night. On your days off you probably hang out with the same people you are already working with and eat more food, watch a couple of movies, hold more production meetings, and then get up and start working again.",1430876926

Any investigations into officer misconduct (at least prior to widespread cellphones) generally resulted in the officer being cleared.  That means that there&#x27;s little/no incentive NOT to do something bad; the odds you get caught are minuscule.<p>Even if there are no truly evil, bad actors the lack of a restraining force means that even with random events and outcomes, officers will tend to behave worse and worse on average.  Initially bad events are outliers but as more happen with no repercussions the average slowly creeps towards &quot;worse&quot; and what used to be rare becomes commonplace.<p>So to me it&#x27;s clear that the police need better management from folks who really get a kick out of putting very, very bad guys behind bars.

That way they can make long term decisions.<p>Secondly, every round the founders lose more and more control.  They should be compensated for this.  Yes, they have economic dilution from the investment as it is now, but some of the shares the investors buy should be founders shares.  This results in less dilution for the company, and is a repayment of the sweat equity they founders have created.<p>One of the big problems with venture capital these days (and the reason I won&#x27;t take it anymore) is that it disrespects the founders by demanding liquidation preferences for the VCs.  As if the VCs who merely put up other people&#x27;s money should have rights superior to the people who literally put part of their life into the company.  That&#x27;s not right.  All shares should be equal, and if not, the founders should at least be respected. (For those firing up your keyboards to explain to me why  LPs are necessary, two points: 1) I&#x27;ve heard a bunch of arguments for this already.  2) they&#x27;ve all come from VCs and are self serving. You can&#x27;t really make an argument that it&#x27;s better for the company or fair for the founders.)<p>Thirdly, too often I&#x27;ve seen VCs force founders to revest shares.  But the value of those shares was already earned.  The founder incentive to do well comes from increasing the value of the shares... and revesting the shares denies the founders crucial voting rights that they have earned already.

One of the interesting things about jobs, and a source of frustration and the reason I&#x27;m much more interested in being a founder than an employee-- is that so many companies are run by people who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this from 20 year old startup &quot;founders&quot; who don&#x27;t know their industry, to 50 year old billionaires who have lots of business experience, and thus opinions, but no wisdom about running a software company.<p>Even with our industry being around for 40 years or so, there are very few companies where programmers are managed by programmers who understand programming.  Too much of the time its &quot;Business&quot; people.<p>So, not only are you going to be incentivized by how well you&#x27;re paid vs the problems you&#x27;re given, you&#x27;re also going to be affected by the quality of the environment (&quot;open plan office? sigh, I can&#x27;t wait til I have been here long enough to quit.&quot;) to the amount of interference and straight up hassle (sometimes even harassment) you are getting from management.<p>Let me give you an example: Last year I worked in an office run by an ex-navy Seal. He cussed, all the time. His motivational technique was to threaten violence- literally. He was a bundle of barely contained psychotic violence and you were just waiting for something to set him off.  I half expected he was going to come in some day and shoot up the office. I don&#x27;t know what his problem was but he was not right in the head.  Needless to say, he knew nothing about programming, software, or even business- his entire career had been in the military.  Certainly every 5 minutes he wanted to have a meeting about something.<p>He thought it was funny to bring in bongo drums and a cowbell... and if we were too quiet, he would bang on them.  For awhile he was showing up at 4pm and trying to get us drunk. I  guess that&#x27;s how they bond in the military.<p>I am not making this up.<p>That company is now on their third team-- they&#x27;ve had %400 turnover in employees over the past 2 years, with the average employee lasting less than 6 months.   And they still haven&#x27;t figured out what the problem is.<p>There&#x27;s no way to know when getting hired that you&#x27;re going into an office like that-- and while that&#x27;s an extreme, over the past 30 years, most of the places I&#x27;ve worked have been dysfunctional to one degree or another.<p>So, you&#x27;re negotiating your salary, you&#x27;re also having to figure out how much combat pay premium you need to tack on.<p>And if you&#x27;re in the business of hiring people, give them meaningful equity and a real vesting schedule if you want them to stay at your startup-- then show them you have the skills to turn the company into a success.  You can start by producing a healthy environment for work.  (and I don&#x27;t mean giving me a year supply of Pabst Blue Ribbon.)",1430874706

9496033,comment,9494663,9495980,0,0,CyrusL,,,"Transactions in AdTech are different than normal payments.<p>For example, imagine an ad campaign spending $30k/month at a rate of $5 per 1,000 impressions. The customer may want their budget spread evenly throughout the month, so the software sets a daily budget of $1000. But this really represents 200,000 daily impressions, each of which is a transaction that subtracts from the available balance in real-time. The buyers software is talking to an ad exchange and keeping track of the budget every time an individual impression is won.<p>To add some more complexity, the impressions are probably billed as second-price auctions, so they aren&#x27;t all exactly $0.005 each. Some are $0.00493, some are $0.00471, ect. Each one of these numbers is reported back from the exchange to the buyer&#x27;s software in real time and the buyer is responsible for managing their budget.<p>This is just an example, but hopefully it illustrates how it can become impractical to account for this kind of thing using something more traditional like PostgreSQL. It would be reasonable to log all the impressions to something like Hadoop for the analytical piece of the software, but there needs to be something more real-time for budgeting to prevent overspending. The big ad exchanges can host hundreds of thousands or even millions of auctions per second, so not turning off bidding can be very costly.<p>This process of auctioning ad impressions across many buyers through an API is called real-time bidding.",1430874600

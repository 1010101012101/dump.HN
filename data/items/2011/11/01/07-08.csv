Inequity between classes, races, genders, religions (and lack of), sexuality and upbringing has existed for at least as long as economic and cultural analysis has. There is a more fundamental question which society has avoided answering: how do you pay people by merit when some people's work is devoid of merit. Many comedian have responded with ""soylent green"" style answers which is appalling but more of an answer than most people can provide (the usual response is, ""I don't know"").<p>If you have a society of winners where winners take all, what happens to the losers?

It used to be called an 'impersonal' action, but my law dictionary says that term's deprecated.<p>Proceedings <i>in rem</i> are usually for the purpose of determining whether there's sufficient evidence to decide that a piece of property is a component in or the proceeds of crime, even if nobody has been caught. An example would be a drug bust where the criminals flee but leave behind a brick of cocaine and a suitcase full of cash. The government can't just seize the money and spend it; it has to come up with some objectively reasonable argument for why the valuables would be forfeit.<p>They do publish details of upcoming hearings in advance, so if you see that the government is trying to keep your stuff and you have a really good explanation for why you should get it back (eg it was stolen but you didn't call it in because you were in a coma following the robbery), then you can turn up at the hearing and get custody back.",1320132454

That's certainly attractive from a scalability perspective.<p>I was really excited to try SimpleGeo out, but decided it was just easier--and less risky since I don't have much NoSQL experience--to use PostGIS.   It also wasn't clear to me whether you could store NON-geographic data in SimpleGeo (such as user accounts).

In fact, the offer looks somewhat... desperate. It's blatantly anti-consumer (lug around a MiFi and pay for the privilege!) in comparison to the AT&T offering. I wonder if it's not part of some contractual agreement from Apple: ""Alright, we'll give you the iPhone, but we want iPads in Verizon stores this holiday season, and [we don't have the CDMA chips ready yet/don't want to announce we have CDMA chips yet].

My head starts to hurt after looking at often un- or poorly-documented libraries written in a mishmash of styles.<p>I often search first - google/irc/bing/mailinglists, etc - because I'll find out pretty quickly if other people are really <i>using</i> the library.  They'll have found and dealt with the real world issues that come up (the docs say X, but <i>really</i>, you should do Y, because of performance, security, etc).  If <i>no one</i> is using something, perhaps there's a reason - searching will turn that up.<p>Finding an error message like ""Foobar is barfoo-ed on line X"", then having to trace through back from line X through 30 calls, then finding that all I see is a sprintf() error message of ""%s is %s"" doesn't really help.  Yay - I read the code!  It's not useful/helpful in debugging my <i>real world</i> use of your library, not the few aspects you felt like documenting or commenting.<p>Looking at code and docs alone only solves my issues about 25% of the time - maybe up to 50% depending on the platform/problem domain.

Between ""economist"",""statistics"", and ""politics"", that's three yellow flags right at the outset.<p>Unless, of course, they agree with me, in which case they are simply wise academics trying to share their wisdom with the unwashed masses. :)<p>There is a logical problem here, and it's much deeper than life expectancy. It's a problem with this form of argument. The problem is that, if you use statistics to make political arguments, <i>you're going to be arguing forever</i>. Whatever this guy wants to do -- and god bless him I hope he gets his way -- next year the same guy will be using statistics to tell us to do something else. That's because you can slice statistics in an almost infinite amount of ways, and I can guarantee you that one of those ways will show some kind of imbalance or injustice that needs addressing.<p>That's all fine and dandy if the entire country could turn on a dime. I wish it could but it can't. Not reality. Instead we live in a system where it takes decades to make even one change, and it's extremely rare to stop doing things that don't work -- we just do more new stuff. I hate to rag on the IRS, but take a look at the tax code. It's so bad that I'm willing to wager nobody alive knows how to file taxes exactly correct.<p>This puts us in an infinite cycle of where we're always measuring things with statistics, finding some social cause worth pursuing, painfully making changes, then making more measurements. Each time through the loop the system gets more and more unwieldy and complex. It's a feedback loop that increases government dysfunction.<p>So instead of arguing about one cause or another, I'd like to suggest a rule for such discussions: if you want to make a case for some kind of social policy change, then make it in terms of a trade-off from whatever the existing status quo is. I realize there are a lot of problems with this suggestion, but at least it starts putting things in terms of trade-offs instead of wish-lists. Just from looking around, it seems to me that the real world is a lot more about trade-offs and compromises than moral crusades and justice. But that's just me.  The only thing that I am observing is that this pattern can be repeated indefinitely, and each time through the loop conditions will continue to deteriorate. It's reactive leadership by statistics, and that almost never works.",1287068105

You cannot do multivariate testing with it.<p>- VWO has heatmap and clickmap reports while Optimizely doesn't<p>- VWO has various advanced features such as visitor segmentation, cross-domain tracking, testing behind login wall pages, test results notifications, variation screen shot generation, etc.<p>- VWO has team collaboration such as multiple-permission based logins and subaccounts. Optimizely doesn't have that.<p>- In VWO, for all plans, CEO equally shares the support work  ;)<p>What Optimizely has that VWO doesn't<p>- Changing layout of the page. Optimizely has a drag and drop feature in its test designer which is useful if you want to test different layouts (say sidebar to the right). To achieve the same in VWO, you need to enter some CSS (say float:right v/s float:left) as there is no drag-drop support (yet)<p>- Since Optimizely exclusively focuses on A/B testing (and not MVT), in its test designer you can change several elements of the page (say headline, image and text) at once to create a variation. In VWO (currently), you need to change one element at once for A/B test and multiple elements for multivariate test.<p>- In optimizely, results update on the page in real time. In VWO, results are also realtime but you have to refresh the report to see latest results (no auto-refreshing)<p>I hope this was a fair comparision. I wish Optimizely team great luck for their product. I hope A/B testing market is big enough for multiple players to survive!",1287068046

Showing someone a website you're trying to sell them and then finishing with ""I just need to change some pictures and stuff"" isn't that compelling. You have 5 websites. Customize one for each restuarant you're talking to. They pass? Change it up with different pictures and titles. Let the customer see what they're buying, not some representation. This is more time consuming, but it will help sales. You already sunk time to designing, building, and SEOing the sites, so an additional unpaid 20 minutes probably won't hurt you too much.<p>Also you can't just assume why people didn't buy the websites. You should have done some random calling after the fact to determine <i>why</i> people weren't buying. But I will throw out a few ideas on that too.<p>You approached restaurants trying to sell them a commodity without knowing what they want. They could have not bought because of the price, because they didn't like the colors, they were intimidated by it's complexity, underwhelmed by its simplicity, or because they didn't think they needed a website (you really need to be making calls).<p>When someone comes to you with a budget and a need for a website, you are in a position of power. You can dictate more terms. Building a random websie without requirements or a scope and then approaching people takes the power out of your hands.<p>Finally, there are thousands of companies that don't have a website because they don't know how to make one or think they cost tens of thousands of dollars. These are the types of companies you can be trying to advertise to (but not cold call/approach).",1287067470

As far as we can tell, the Macbook decided to update itself in the hotel while she was out and had left the MiFi on. With the indicator light design on the MiFi it's not simple to tell the difference between ""I'm charging"" and ""I'm eating up all of your allowed bandwidth at roaming rates"". The result was an almost $900 bill for data roaming charges. I don't think we even exceeded her 2GB/month allowance, at least not by much.<p>Apparently, in Verizon's view, Canada is such a technologically backward nation that it costs an order of magnitude more to send data over their maple-syrup-soaked drunken-beaver-operated telecommunications system than it does here in the US.<p>There was no recourse; Verizon doesn't care why the bandwidth was used, even if it was unintentional. We canceled the contract.<p>EDIT: Contrasting point: for my Android, Verizon gives me unlimited data for $45/month. I use at least 1GB/month, and that's without watching videos or doing any other data-intensive stuff that I'd probably want to do on an iPad. (I don't pay the extra $20/month they want for tethering.

OTOH, 1GB is not a lot of data... it's $35 for 3GB and $50 for 5GB, with $10/GB overage

Granted, I have quite an old computer but it's perfect for spotting differences between browsers. For others this is probably not an issue.<p>I use the mail client for my GMail and RSS feeds. Try it and tell me if you notice anything wrong with it. Actually I've been using the integrated client for so long that my perception about stand-alone mail clients is that they're a thing of the past.
I guess it's just a matter of perspective, but for me it's far more convenient to open my browser and not think about checking my mail (it lets me know if new mail has arrived).<p>I don't use Opera Unite and nobody is forcing me to. It just stays out of my way, and so do the other features. Keep only what you like; just because they're there if you need them doesn't mean they slow you down.",1287064859

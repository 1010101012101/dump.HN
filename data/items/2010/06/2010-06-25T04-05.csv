And from what I know, you can even get those benefits at huge companies like Google.<p>There's a difference between <i>saying you do</i> and actually doing it. No one will say ""no, you don't have autonomy -- we don't hire top talent so we have to micromanage; we work very strict fixed hours; you'll be writing CRUD screens for sales people"" (I've seen companies claim flexible hours in that ""you're have come strictly at 9, but you can leave at 5, you don't have to come in at 8 or stay till 6!"").<p>A start-up can say many things, but e.g., if one place is doing very routine database driven webapps and the other is actually solving far more interesting problems (makes systems software vs. ""yet another website"", or if they're a web site writing their own search stack and other interesting infrastructure, or does serious machine learning development, leads open source projects, etc...) it's pretty obvious.  Plenty start-ups also hire PHP script kiddies (while talking about hiring ""rock stars"") and other assorted bozos (because they have a project to finish by a specific deadline), while others are more rigorous than Google (from what I heard, Kosmix is one such example).<p>Google is a large company and obviously there are many boring but business crucial jobs to do there. Nonetheless, at least now, they're fairly explicit what area you'll be working on (e.g., systems programming vs. application programming, sometimes even down to a specific team). Free food and drinks are nice, but that's not why I would still (if I were looking for job) apply there, knowing well others likely give better salaries and fancier titles; the long interview process is a discouragement when other companies are extremely aggressive about getting you to sign an offer, but it has changed now.",1277441364

What we've seen in this tournament (and many before it) is that rankings are a pretty poor estimate of actual performance -- or at the very least, there are some outlier results which have perhaps gained notoriety due to their outlier nature.<p>One problem I would suggest is that ranking are primarily derived from past performance. I'm not sure about the Elo ranking, but the official FIFA one is based on results from the last four years (eight years before 2006!) -- in highest-level football that is way too long.<p>Perhaps another problem is that there are simply too few games in the tournament for this to work reliably. Given 50 games, a team's win-draw-lose count might be estimated pretty reliably, because a string of three bad games can be offset by a string of three above-expectations games.

Personal cashflow is a pretty good metric. What other metric matters?<p>Did you mean ""metric"" in the sense of measurable quantities or in the sense of ""things that matter""? While they very hard to quantify (and thus aren't ""metrics"" in the true sense of the word), I am pretty sure I am not alone when I say that peers, autonomy, challenging work and capacity for continued learning and technical growth are more important than monetary benefits.",1277438808

After the N800 was released with OS 2008, the Nokia 770 never received a supported upgrade.  (There is ""OS 2008 Hacker Edition"" for the 770, but its performance and stability was noticeably degraded compared to OS 2007.)<p>I'm glad to hear they'll be focusing on Meego as their flagship OS, since it's been at best a hobby until now.  But somehow the platform has had as much fragmentation as Android even though they are a single company producing all the hardware and software (and only four models ever produced, at that).",1277438690

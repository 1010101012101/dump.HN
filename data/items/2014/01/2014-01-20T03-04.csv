This is often overlooked by people (at least in my experience in America). I&#x27;ve had many friends who claimed to hate Green Tea because it is bitter. But they changed their minds when I brewed them a cup and explained that it is important not to burn the leaves with hot water and then over-steep the tea---rather than boiling water you often want water considerably cooler, say 150-180 F, depending on the tea. You also don&#x27;t want to steep for too long (often just a minute or two, again depends on the tea).",1390190243

7087461,comment,7087310,7087385,11,0,timothya,,,"I agree that automatically-updating extensions has the potential to be somewhat insecure. However, I don&#x27;t see how the alternative could be a better alternative. If they didn&#x27;t auto-update, then the majority of users would likely never update their extensions, and the ones that do would be unlikely to audit the extensions that they update for malware. Do you audit the apps on your phone before you update them?<p>To mitigate the problem, Chrome does have the permissions model to limit what extensions can do, and if an extension requires more permissions after an update, Chrome will give you a warning, along with an option to remove the extension. Your best defence is to not grant overly broad permissions when you first install the extension.<p>Regarding your comment about Chrome&#x27;s automatic updates being &quot;bad&quot;, I disagree wholeheartedly - the web platform would not be able to move forward at the same rate that it can today. One of the biggest problems with IE was simply that it was updated so infrequently that it was really hard to support the large percentage of outdated versions. We&#x27;d be in the same situation with Chrome if it didn&#x27;t auto-update. Furthermore, I trust Chrome to make good decisions for my security. I&#x27;d rather have my browser updated quickly so that vulnerabilities in the browser can be fixed quickly before they affect me.",1390190146

I once mentioned that Go does not fit into my usual project setup - I keep git repos in ~/sources. Go requires me to instead dedicate an entire directory structure to my entire Go workspace, which I have to keep seperate from the other sources. This could easily be avoided by letting me set enviornment variables that would relocate some of these folders (especially bin and pkg) to different places.<p>This is an example of how Go as a language is pretentious. It&#x27;s way is the best way, even when no one else does it that way. The community becomes pretentious whenever you draw criticism against these core choices (note this mostly comes from #go-nuts, I haven&#x27;t spent a lot of time on the mailing list).

Thus Healthcare for them, is in every sense of the word: free.<p>For those that earn > 28k, they pay tax, which a portion of goes to healthcare.  So from 28k to probably (random guess) about 70-100k, healthcare is heavily subsidised.

That is, instead of having 2 images that are simply &quot;fed&quot; into each eye but projected onto a flat screen that is not converged with the 3d disparity &quot;information&quot; contained in the images, you have a system where the screen emits a light field that your eyes can focus on at any depth. We already have consumer level light field  cameras and attachments. the displays are tricker, but possible, traditionally through the use of hexagonal lenticular lenslets carefully registered onto a 2d &quot;flattened&quot; projection of the light field capture. This is the &quot;True hologram&quot; dream mentioned. The primary limitations being the level of precision and resolution with which you can register the lenslets with an image.<p>that&#x27;s fine for a display but is obviously impractical for a large scale theater projection system. Just an arbitrary possibility I thought of just now: suppose the projection screen had a retroreflective surface- That is, light projected at the screen gets returned at exactly the angle it arrived at. Combine this with a domed mirror and a backwards pointing projector or set of projectors, with all the requisite optics math and geometry work, it may just be possible to project a lightfield at a screen that bounces back at the audience and appears as a tangible hologram to them.",1390189526

To break out the bad analogies, it&#x27;s like ordering from a restaurant menu. You ask the runtime for an instance of a class. If you want something special, you have to have it put on the menu first. Prototype restaurants have no menus, but they have the dishes on display, and you can order those.

If he&#x27;s eaten half of it already, you&#x27;ll only get as much as he has left, but luckily you can add combine it with other dishes or ingredients as you go.<p>You can see that if we put some rules in place about which objects can be copied, and what happens during copying exactly, and we call some special objects classes, and use them to create other special objects we call instances, a prototype-based object system can be made to behave like any class-based object system.

Have you seen the demographics of Yale[1]? Even just racial demographics put WTFs to this[2]. 7% of Yale students are black--16% of Americans born between 1992 and 1996 are black (and overwhelmingly poor). 9% of Yale students are Hispanic. 14% of Americans born between 1992 and 1996 are Hispanic (and are comparatively only often poor). Does that seem like it makes sense to you if certain populations weren&#x27;t getting advantages based on external factors?<p>&quot;They pick the best&quot; often comes up as a possibility to answer that. Because they sort of do, social signaling aside (and Haufler is white and male so he&#x27;s a few rungs up <i>that</i> ladder too). But <i>isn&#x27;t it funny</i> how &quot;the best&quot; generally also correlates to &quot;white or Asian and rich&quot;? SAT scores against income[3] are pretty indicative; SAT against racial demographics[also 3] likewise. This is not hard: non-Asian minorities are overwhelmingly more likely to be really-goddam-poor than whites and Asians and are much more likely to score like shit on the signaling tests that are your ticket to the upper-crust-signaling environment of a Yale. (And, as mentioned, even poor whites are more likely to have the social signals that are attractive to groups that select for &quot;their type of people&quot;--like, you know, most societal gatekeepers.) The conflation of economic and social advantages what makes these people <i>privileged</i>.<p>Crack babies don&#x27;t get into Yale[4]. Children of illegal immigrants don&#x27;t get into Yale. People who grow up in extreme poverty don&#x27;t get into Yale. That doesn&#x27;t make people who get into Yale <i>bad</i> but it does mean that they have advantages that need to be recognized over the girl who didn&#x27;t get the opportunity to learn English or the guy who didn&#x27;t get the opportunity to grow up in a safe environment where school was valued. Or, y&#x27;know, <i>their kids</i> when it&#x27;s their turn to not be even remotely close to the &quot;right stuff&quot; for Yale.<p>And this is what the guy you dismissively shat on for no good reason understands: that it&#x27;s important for us, as people with incredible luck and massive advantages, aware that <i>no</i>, not everyone has these advantages, and so it behooves us to do right by them, too. What Haufler did is cool and it sucks that his amazingly selective private school got frowny at a student for a similar project, but as injustices go, this shit&#x27;s pretty small--if he&#x27;s of a mind to, he&#x27;s gonna walk out of college into a job making no less than the <i>eighty-eighth percentile of individual income in this country</i>[5]. Having your kids be nearly guaranteed to do no better, and probably worse, than you did, in a system designed to keep you where you are? That&#x27;s pretty big. That&#x27;s what he&#x27;s saying.

7087323,comment,7082939,7083632,2,0,thaumasiotes,,,">  I knew how to calculate with radians, but <i>never</i> understood their basis until viewing this animation, despite asking people on a number of occasions what the benefits were vs. degrees. (They never gave me a real answer to that question, and certainly never derived the basis for radians.)<p>Well, the way I think of the basis for radians goes like so:<p>1. All circles are similar to all other circles (assumed without proof), so there&#x27;s a relationship between the radius of a circle and its circumference.<p>2. Angles, being scale-free, ignore the size of a particular circle; if an angle captures 1/3 of a small circle, it will capture the same 1/3 of a larger one, or a smaller one.<p>3. We can use the combination of an angle (&quot;How much of the circle are we talking about?&quot;) and a radius (&quot;How big is this circle?&quot;) to specify an arclength along the edge.  We do it by multiplying the radius by the angle, and then by a conversion factor.<p>4. The radian measure is chosen so that the conversion factor mentioned in step (3) is equal to 1, which is easy to multiply by.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem: out of a normal-sized group of randomly selected math students, expect between 0 and 1 of them (generally 0) to be interested in hearing you say this.<p>There&#x27;s another argument for using radians (related, but not obviously so, to the first), which goes like this:<p>1. When measuring in radians, the trig functions behave well when taking the derivative: d/dx (sin x) = cos x and so forth.<p>2. If we used degrees (e.g., call dsin x the sine function for degrees instead of radians), we&#x27;d get all these awful constants mucking up our computations.  d/dx (dsin x) = (180/π) dcos x, and d/dx (dtan x) = (180/π) dsec^2 x.  The fourth derivative of sin x is sin x, but the fourth derivative of dsin x is (1049760000/π^4) dsin x.  So we use radians to measure angles for the same reason we use <i>e</i> to measure logarithms -- they are more correct.<p>That one has the double disadvantage of being something no one wants to hear and drawing on applications they haven&#x27;t yet heard of.<p>There&#x27;s a shorter, less accurate version of the first approach I presented, that goes like so:<p>1. A circle&#x27;s radius and circumference are both linear measures; they both have units of length to the first power.<p>2. Therefore, the conversion between them is a dimensionless (= unitless) number, a constant.<p>3. Radians are the unique correct constant for that &quot;conversion&quot; (there can&#x27;t be more than one, any more than there can be more than one constant that converts meters to kilometers).<p>This is short and easy to say, but is sloppier and unsatisfying to precisely the students who care.",1390187573

What the EFF does <i>is not</i> &quot;stooping to that level&quot; -- what the industry does is on a whole different scale. But posting a disproof of infallibility every time the EFF has anything to say about anything creates the false impression that what the EFF does could be equivalent to what the industry does.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like this: A principal should avoid criticizing a teacher in front of the students.",1390187105

Adding more &quot;foreign&quot; features actually ruins the balance.<p>Having &quot;just this&quot; and following the paradigm of layered DSLs embedded in a Lisp,  popularized by SICP, lots of complicated things could be created, including CLOS which is nothing but a DSL (a bunch of macros and procedures).<p>This notion of what a Lisp is actually helpful to understand not just Clojure but also Haskell, which is, in some sense, also a small kernel based on Lambda Calculus and tons of syntactic sugar.<p>By adding more and more features without breaking the balance we got Common Lisp, while an attempt to keep the balance produced R5RS.<p>If we switch the perspective on what Clojure is to the notion of a scripting language for the JVM (a-la Ruby) with sometimes looks like a Lisp and sometimes behaves like a Lisp, but strictly speaking not a Lisp, because the unique balance was ruined by adding stuff, everything, it seems, falls into its places.<p>Arc is a dialect of Lisp, Clojure is language of its own, but marketed as a &quot;modern dialect of Lisp&quot;, which makes no sense.",1390186805

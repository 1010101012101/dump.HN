3555705,comment,3555102,3555564,2,0,angstrom,,,"He's talking about the supply chain optimization. One example is the dram chips used to build the iphone came from Samsung. They were sourced at quantities so large they are actually cheaper for Apple's iPhone than they are for Samsung's own phones. Streamlined products where the only segmentation is storage space make this possible. They can actually request such a large order their competitors can't match and get squeezed to the end of the manufacturing line while also paying more. To match they have to spend more. This hurts even more if your'e not controlling the distribution.<p>To the average non-techie all they have to decide is what color and storage size they want. This makes the device friendlier to consumers and takes away stress of understanding the hardware choices. The customer is actually happier if they don't have too many choices. People pay as much for this as they do the curated apps.",1328486301

3555702,comment,3554863,3554863,3,0,tylerneylon,,,"Summary: Current peer review is not 100%; we need to think in terms of authors' motivations (tenure); try a hacker news model, possibly layered with badges-of-approval from editorial board.<p>The quality of peer review is only as good as the editorial board and reviewers make it -- often this is a lower standard than we expect.  This article lists several extreme examples of poor practices by a (previously-)prominent publisher:<p><a href=""http://blog.mathunion.org/journals/?no_cache=1&tx_t3blog_pi1%5BblogList%5D%5BshowUid%5D=30&tx_t3blog_pi1%5BblogList%5D%5Byear%5D=2012&tx_t3blog_pi1%5BblogList%5D%5Bmonth%5D=02&tx_t3blog_pi1%5BblogList%5D%5Bday%5D=05&cHash=a2d6424f899302a7ea3b75b9bb591802"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mathunion.org/journals/?no_cache=1&tx_t3blog...</a><p>The key to shifting academic quality control away from the present archaic model is through author's motivation.  The replacement needs to be a system that improves and filters incoming papers, and at the same time earns at least as much prestige for the authors who participate.<p>One idea is something like a combination hacker news and stackoverflow with academic articles in place of news articles / technical questions as the object of discussion.  Papers can be changed in response to comments.  High scores for either a paper or an author on such a site could replace the prestige granted by acceptance into a top-tier journal.  Points are awarded for reviews, and researchers are respected for their scores (closer to tenure), so there is more positive motivation to review than in today's system (which is: it's rude not to review when asked).<p>I think that alone could work.  Some academics might balk at a lack of editorial boards.  Fine, let's allow some editors in the mix.  An editorial board is an aggregator.  They choose what content fits their filter, and may open a discussion with an author on improvements, possibly bringing in reviewers.  In the end, readers will see a prestigious badge of the board's approval on high-quality articles, and there could be a page or rss feed to browse the articles meeting this standard.  This can all exist on top of the hacker news / stackoverflow system, which itself could be built on top of an arXiv-like system.<p>Several of these ideas are motivated by thoughts from the blogs of Tim Gowers and Michael Nielsen.",1328486271

That would account for some difference in the habit of buying hardware in the beginning (say 60s and 70s): EE already had to buy a lot of that while the math department did not, so it was a new thing for a department that generally did not have high capital expenses.<p>But I don't think the ability to buy hardware is as relevant as the different mindset between mathematicians, who focus on more abstract problems, and engineers, who focus on more concrete problems, especially today when hardware is cheap.

3555662,comment,3554719,3555587,4,0,mathalicious,,,"Thanks for the comments. Very helpful. Again, to reiterate, I actually like Khan Academy, and the post wasn't critiquing Khan as much as it was <i>our turning Khan into something that it's not.</i> The post wasn't about Khan. It was about us.
<br>
Schools are experimenting with using it as a core instructional tool. That is not in question. Whether or not Khan himself is advocating this is besides the point (although they are involved in pilot programs). The point is that schools & districts are turning to a style of instruction that we know from research does not work, and that threatens to postpone the more important -- and necessary -- conversation about better teaching and better curriculum.
<br>
That said, I have heard what Khan has said about how he envisions Khan Academy being used. (Awkward sentence; apologies). He wants teachers to be able to offload skills instruction in order to be freed up to pursue projects and other applications. In theory, this is terrific. As a former classroom teacher myself, I know how much time we spend on basic skills. However, my concern -- and let's be clear; I say this as a teacher -- is that if students aren't learning the skills correctly in the first place, then they won't be able to apply them.
<br>
Finally, as someone who has spent considerable time -- and all of his savings -- trying to create a product that will help teachers teach better from the curriculum angle, I can tell you that Khan Academy <i>has</i> made it incredibly difficult to fund new projects in the ed space. Yes, there is more money than ever, but almost all of it is for platforms. Nobody wants to put money into effective content, because the media narrative has convinced them that the math problem has already been ""solved."" Having watched many, many Khan Academy videos, and having spoken to any number of teachers and school administrators, I have a difficult time believing this to be true.",1328485050

It may very well be a band-aid on the symptoms of our sick math education system. It might also be improving scores of students on exams.<p>I happen to be in the camp that HOW we are teaching and HOW we are measuring the learning of mathematics is the problem. We are teaching procedures simply to try to get the right data. We avoid actually teaching mathematics because the only real way to figure out what someone understands is to ask for an explanation and discussion and those results depend on trusting teachers to evaluate the understanding and assign a measure to it.<p>It seems that the best job we do teaching mathematics occurs at the lowest and highest extremes. K-3 elementary students, and Ph.D. Students. It's because at those extremes it's more about conversation than scores. Notice that no one gives Ph.D. students multiple choice quizzes.<p>Now back to Khan Academy, so this is how we are going to use this powerful computational tool to teach Mathematics? Watch video and take multiple choice quizzes? Anyone who thinks that's revolutionary doesn't understand the history of educational technology. This has all been done before, just not free. Free is the only difference between Khan Academy and all of the other previous efforts of using automatic quizzing systems and pre-taped lectures to teach.<p>I be a jerk to criticize Khan without offering an alternative. There has been a project happening at the University of Illinois for the past 20 years that IS revolutionary and does use the full power of the computer to change the approach to teaching math, AND flips the classroom the way Khan speaks of. It uses content written in Mathematica to approach the subject from the model level rather than the procedure level. It's simply too difficult for most people to understand models by doing hand calculations. However, once the models have been well explored and understood the procedures become trivial.<p>I am part of a project called Making Math to bring the model of teaching using Mathematica to the web using modern Javascript techniques. We're adding all the communication and feedback mechanisms as well as authoring and editing interfaces. BUT our motto is ""if a computer can grade it, it's not worth asking."" We feel that way because we expect explanations, and because at the end of the day, students want feedback from mentor, both help, and a pat on the back for a job well done.<p>(the one thing I like about Khan Academy is the marginalization of the lecture format and the flipping of the classroom. I just happen to think we can flip the classroom by engaging students in better activities, and providing a mechanism to explore and explain mathematical models).",1328483279

Also, can you back up your claims?<p>Of course I am aware that he will eventually have to deal with tough things alone. However, it is not obvious that he should have to do so as a helpless baby.<p>Honestly, I am a bit shocked that you can be so convinced of a potentially evil theory. I would be very interested in your sources.<p>The theory to ""experience a lot of tough things to become tougher"" also sounds rather backwards to me. How far should we go? Should we give him a short lived pet so that he can learn to deal with death? Should we beat him, so that he is prepared for school yard bullies?<p>Suppose you try climbing a tree for the first time. Is it really easier if daddy is not standing there prepared to catch you if you fall? Would it make you more inclined to try climbing the tree if daddy wasn't there?",1328483000

Students watch the lectures and help each other out, then supplement the course by presenting papers and aiming to have project ready for publication by the end of the semester. It's a small course consisting of grad students and upper division undergrads. It will be an interesting experiment.<p>But I think this is a great model, in my experience state schools tend to have pockets of really bright students that can easily out preform the quality of the teachers (certainly not always the case).  There are huge opportunities to improve public higher education in the US",1328482971

We all, including Khan, recognize there is a problem.<p>3. You gravely mischaracterize Khan's approach. Yes, the video you selected (out of thousands) does promote rote methods, as do many of the exercises. But Khan is also at pains to demonstrate mathematical reasoning from first principles, and to emphasize why we use the methods we do, why they work, and what relevance they have to the real world - in real world terms that make at least as much sense to me as those used by mathalicious. These 'reason' and 'proof' videos are judiciously interspersed with the 'rote' videos and taken together form exactly the kind of compelling mathematical narrative you complain is lacking from typical math curricula.<p>4. This is great. Students can view and review Khan's videos as their core learning material, help each other, and make use of the teacher's limited time according to metrics which continually and repeatedly assess their personal level of comprehension (which, as they absorb  substantial portions of a playlist, will expand far beyond the memorization of rote methods).<p>5. Hard data will soon show if you are right, but it is my impression that thousands have already benefited.<p>6. The Khan model, taken in its entirety, only encourages this.<p>7. If you listen to what Khan actually says in his various talks, he is proposing that his site has a novel and exciting role to play as part of a general restructuring of math education along the lines your propose.<p>You could have taken the view that the Khan Academy is a useful tool and resource, yet to capitalize on it we must redouble our efforts to improve education funding, classroom teaching methods and better curricula. That sounds reasonable. Instead you wrote an article attacking the Khan Academy as being a direct impediment to this kind of progress. Few respondents here on HN have found your arguments persuasive, and instead of replying to the kind of points I make above, you tellingly characterize us as follows:<p><i>It seems like the anti-post comments fall in three categories: 1. Khan is great 2. Mathalicious is just jealous 3. The author of the post is part of the establishment and should be ignored</i><p>The discussion here has been far more nuanced and sophisticated than you allow for - kind of like the way you discredit Khan's videos.",1328482920

3555582,comment,3554054,3555215,4,0,srean,,,"> I think it's only a matter of time before Scala (or something like it) starts outperforming C++ on parallel problems.<p>It is certainly plausible. But a few things need to change<p>(i) JVM applications tend to be memory heavy, even if you can approach 75% of the run time speed of a C or a C++ application you would typically need a lot more memory. In my expeience it has been 8 times or more, YMMV.<p>(ii) The other problem is that all the exciting native SIMD instructions are mostly out of reach. This can be a drag especially when your code uses log and exponentiation a lot. Without SIMD they are terribly expensive.<p>(iii) The kind of things that I use C++ for is heavy in array operations, in particular manipulating sparse arrays. In these applications the loop bounds are not constant and it is impossible to ensure at compile time that the array indexing will not go out of bounds. There Java's runtime bounds checking does slow it down. A way to override the safety would help.<p>(iv) The other good thing about C++ is the ability to delay evaluation via the use of templates, I am talking about expression templates. Its not pretty by any one's standards but with suitable libraries you can get the job done.<p>> I don't think any Lisps are fast enough to be interesting to you<p>Under favorable circumstances Lisps can easily give C++ a run for its money, even on numeric code. For that take a look at Stalin. It's unbelieveable how much one can optimize, even without type annotations.<p>There are few new curly brace languages out there, that are trying to simplify generic programming. D is the more mature among these and the new exciting ones are Clay, Deca and Rust. All have been discussed on HN. Exciting times ahead.<p>A multithreaded runtime for OCaMl will be realy cool. I do not need that threads be surfaced as an API but the possibility that parallelism exposed by the functional style can be exploited by the runtime (perhaps based on options used to start the runtime).<p>Yes there is F# but mono I hear is not that great on Linux, though I have not tried it myself.<p>OCaMl / Stalin: An old and civil discussion <a href=""https://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.scheme/browse_thread/thread/349c51b1d30d2b3e/34a7757985bd4b7b?hl=en&pli=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.scheme/browse_thre...</a><p>Clay: <a href=""http://claylabs.com/clay/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://claylabs.com/clay/</a> and recently discussed here <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3474722"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3474722</a><p>Deca: discussed here <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3413936"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3413936</a> and here <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3413936"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3413936</a><p>Rust and D I think do not need championing :)",1328482832

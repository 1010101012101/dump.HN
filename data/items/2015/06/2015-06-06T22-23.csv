But current implementations are sloppy and leak all sorts of information. Usually you can just run some (inline!) Javascript to inspect the DOM and then do something.<p>Or, if the client won&#x27;t run Javascript at all (and you might consider making your site require Javascript to render anything, just to stymie these users, if you&#x27;re on this path already), you can still set a background-image property as a &quot;default&quot; for a banner div, in a way that it will never get requested if the ad does get rendered, but will get requested if it doesn&#x27;t. (OKCupid uses this approach, if I recall.) You can then use that information just for analytics, or you can go further and change what the server serves that client from then on (i.e. make all further pages for that session return an error.)",1433631468

But France -- a nation called out in this article for being well-connected by high-speed trains, is about the same vertical height as California. It&#x27;s a bit wider.<p>If you place the northern tip of France on the northern border of California, the southern tip of France lands just north of San Diego. We have about 40 million people; France has about 60 million.<p>Japan (another country with great trains), is about the same vertical distance north/south as the west coast of the US. And while Japan&#x27;s population is crammed into the coastline of an island nation where it&#x27;s expensive to build, we have gobs of open space where it&#x27;s comparatively cheap to run rail.<p>There&#x27;s simply no excuse. Sure, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to try to make a high-speed train across the country, but we should have <i>great</i> regional rail systems in the US. The east/west coasts, in particular, should be corridors for rail -- if you can get from Kagoshima to Tokyo in 6 hours by Shinkansen, there&#x27;s no reason you couldn&#x27;t get from New York to Miami in the same amount of time.",1433631439

If not, don&#x27;t feel too bad - the cards were stacked against you from the outset.<p>In either case, the most important thing to remember is that Internet does not owe you a living.

It has purposes that are significantly higher and deeper than hustling cheap, fast content while trying to make quick buck by selling your audience&#x27;s personal details to fly-by-night ad networks.<p>Not everyone operates like this, of course. Google, Facebook, and BuzzFeed  are all examples of places with far cleaner models. All they sell is access. None of them make information available to others. Indeed, they all guard what they know very jealously. And Google aside, they haven&#x27;t been vectors for piracy.<p>But on balance, the Internet has been pretty terrible for people who work in the content industries, and the new media industries - in partnership with advertisers - have been pretty terrible for the Internet.

9672501,comment,9672027,9672027,0,0,hoop,,,"Hi there, I&#x27;m quite new to engineering management as well, with approximately one year of experience. I&#x27;ve had some great mentors, as well as a reading list passed down to me. I&#x27;ll highlight those I found as having the most impact for me.<p>At the top of the list is &quot;Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager&quot; by Michael Lopp[1], which was recommended to me by a manager who helped me get my start in engineering management. This book touches on a lot of the nuances in dealing with people and, as an introvert, I found this really helpful. The same author blogs under &quot;Rands in Repose[2]&quot; which has much of the content from the aforementioned book available for free.<p>While in the people category you&#x27;ll also get a lot of recommendations for &quot;Drive!&quot; by Daniel Pink[2], which is a book about intrinsic motivators (autonomy, mastery, purpose) and how they are more important and effective than extrinsic motivators (e.g. money), particularly for knowledge workers. My personal advice, however, is to watch his TED talk[3] which is a great summary of basically the entire book. In this same category I could also recommend &quot;The Great Jackass Fallacy&quot; by Harry Levinson[5].<p>Now on the wall between people management and engineering/project management is &quot;Slack&quot; by Tom DeMarco[6], which is about how organizations and managers tend to run their staff at 100% capacity. As the book points out, however, this is a good way to not only burn people out, but it also sends response times through the roof (from queuing theory), and stifles change (&quot;too busy to improve&quot;). You can read this one on a plane. For some shameless self promotion, I&#x27;ve also written a tiny blog post relating Slack and the need for upkeep (software operations and maintenance)[7].<p>Next, fully in engineering/project management, I have to recommend &quot;Waltzing with Bears&quot; by Tom DeMarco and Anthony Lister[8], which is specifically about managing risk on software projects. The authors highlight the common practice of project/engineering managers communicating their &quot;nano date&quot;, which they point out is typically the <i>lowest</i> point on the uncertainty curve. In other words, the project has the <i>lowest</i> possible chance of shipping by this date when you look at the possible timeline as a probability distribution. This book changed the way I talk about projects and the way I manage my team&#x27;s various risks and I have been more successful as a result.<p>One final recommendation I&#x27;ll make, since you&#x27;re in the midst of a transition, is &quot;The First 90 Days&quot; by Michael Watkins[9]. It&#x27;s a wonderful book that outlines how and why one should develop a transition plan in order to hit the ground running - and in the right direction. For my last engineering management opportunity, developing a preliminary 90 day plan as part of a &quot;starter project,&quot; was a major factor in being given the job.<p>I believe that a subset of these will give you a great start. After that, you should read on the areas you feel the need for the most amount of help with or the areas that interest you. If you are avidly interested in project management, for example, you should read books on various methodologies, particularly the one that you or your organization practice.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering/dp/1430243147"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engi...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://randsinrepose.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://randsinrepose.com/</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1433627889&sr=1-2&keywords=drive%21"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation?language=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation?language=en</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Great-Jackass-Fallacy-Harry-Levinson/dp/0875841007"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Great-Jackass-Fallacy-Harry-Levinson/d...</a><p>[6]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Slack-Getting-Burnout-Busywork-Efficiency/dp/0767907698/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1433626981&sr=8-1&keywords=slack&pebp=1433626983688&perid=1BWKDGRPZP6AMCF156YQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Slack-Getting-Burnout-Busywork-Efficie...</a><p>[7]: <a href=""http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/on-slack-and-upkeep/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/on-slack-and-upkeep/</a><p>[8]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Waltzing-Bears-Managing-Software-Projects/dp/0932633609/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1433626973&sr=1-1&keywords=waltzing+with+bears&pebp=1433626985821&perid=1KP925A6D8K69ABHF3KE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Waltzing-Bears-Managing-Software-Proje...</a><p>[9]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-First-90-Days-Strategies/dp/1591391105"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-First-90-Days-Strategies/dp/159139...</a>",1433628867

The main problem I ran into is that going too far results in software that&#x27;s hard to maintain because control flow jumps around.<p>My solution has been to think of code locality as being valuable. I start off writing something the straightforward way. When I go to implement something similar, I decide whether to abstract the code or not based on how much easier/harder it will be to naively trace the code. If I&#x27;ve done this thing 3 or 4 times, it&#x27;s a concern and should be separated.

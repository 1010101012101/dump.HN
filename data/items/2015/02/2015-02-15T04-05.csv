You don&#x27;t need another broken altcoin (Ethereum) to know this, you need to understand what the blockchain accomplishes to know this. I&#x27;m sure once Ethereum fails there will be a new next big thing and people will get sucked into another broken system, but you can actually understand what is a good idea if you try to understand the blockchain. You don&#x27;t need to cross items from the near-infinite list of possible bad ideas to know what&#x27;s a bad idea.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by &quot;Ideas like this to be built on top of them.&quot; If you already have Ethereums PoW consensus system, what the hell would having a PoS consensus system on top of that accomplish?<p>>but they are not &quot;fractal&quot; and we will know in the near future with empirical data which ones need to be tossed away.<p>They are certainly fractal. One could recursively say why each of those fixes have problems, and eventually you would end up with a fully centralized system that masquerades itself as being decentralized and PoS or a completely broken system that is attackable for near-free.",1423976387

9051800,comment,9049698,9051314,0,0,pcwalton,,,"> I&#x27;ve been going through the academic papers, forerunners, and source-code for Rust&#x27;s static memory routines and borrowing semantics. My hope and suspicion is that it can be added to Nim without core changes to the language like lifetimes. It&#x27;s definitely not a guarantee, but with lots of experience in both languages now I feel very strongly that adding region-based-memory-management to Nim is possible while adding Nim&#x27;s clarity, abstractions, and efficiency to Rust feels impossible.<p>I&#x27;m not so sure. The trickiest part of getting memory safety without garbage collection working is not the lifetimes but the borrow check, which relies on inherited mutability and, most importantly, <i>the lack of aliasable mutable data</i>. The APIs and libraries of garbage collected imperative languages invariably depend on aliasable, mutable memory. Consider something as simple as a tree or graph data structure with mutable nodes. Or consider taking two mutable references to different indices of an array, or splitting an array into mutable slices with dynamically computed indices. These are all things you (presumably) can do today in Nim, and a borrow checker would break them. The likelihood that the library APIs depend on being able to do it is very high.<p>I never say never: you could implement multiple types of references, some GC&#x27;d and some not, and copy the Rust borrowing semantics. But they would be incompatible with most existing APIs and libraries. I don&#x27;t think it can be realistically retrofitted onto a language without breaking most APIs: aliasable, mutable data is just too common.<p>Regarding efficiency/performance, what in particular seems impossible to add to Rust?",1423975413

But the performance requirements of a systems programming language are just very different from the requirements for a web server or applications language.<p>From my point of view, and the industry I&#x27;m in, the latency requirements of a web server stack look completely laughable. That&#x27;s not to say there aren&#x27;t challenges in a web stack, because many web servers have to handle orders of magnitude more I/O than we do, and efficient load balancing over a distributed system is extremely difficult and I am fortunate to rarely have to think about that kind of thing. But a requirement like &quot;99% of requests need to have a response time of 200ms or lower&quot; looks like fiddlesticks compared to a requirement like &quot;a round-trip-time of more than 100us will be a large problem and get noticed&quot;.<p>My point is that Google&#x27;s, CloudFlare&#x27;s, and Dropbox&#x27;s &quot;performance-critical backends&quot; don&#x27;t require the same things as some other workloads.

Now that I&#x27;ve tasted something resembling an expressive type &quot;system&quot; (however narrow, incomplete and warty it is), which encourages immutable objects, and does so in a very painless and idiosyncratic way - while still bringing many of the benefits of declarative/&quot;up front&quot; programming for free - I really, really miss it.<p>So of all the things that could have made me realize I&#x27;ve had enough of dynamic languages, it certainly feels odd that a Perl OO bolt-on would show me a glimpse of what I&#x27;ve been missing out on. And even weirder that the closed-mindedness of the average pythonista made up my mind to move on.",1423973498

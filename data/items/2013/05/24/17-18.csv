5764377,comment,5763056,5763056,1,0,ocrickard,,,"Awesome article.  Very evenly balanced in its conclusions, though it avoided the subject of asynchronous rendering/layout.  I would add that it is possible to achieve the 1/60th sec. setup time for more complex drawing (NSAttributedStrings, composited views) through the use of background rendering/compositing into CALayers that are delivered to the cells only when complete, though it gets complex very fast, and as noted the performance in newer devices is rapidly getting to the point that I don't have to think so much about this anymore.

5764374,comment,5763056,5764298,1,0,nglevin,,,"I use -drawRect any time I need a UIView's CGContext. For everything else, I use -layoutSubviews.<p>When you do anything in Core Animation in -drawRect, that throws all drawing on CPU, instead of dividing the work between the CPU and GPU. Which, in one project where I was doing Core Animation alongside OpenGL, that had some very bad consequences.<p>Core Animation is pretty interesting. Internally, it does some drawing with Core Graphics, but that's only if you use certain features (i.e., use of CAShapeLayers, anything involving shadows)... and even then, CG is pretty darned fast.<p>I've found CAShapeLayers can be a bit of a resource hog, but since those resources tend to be thrown behind 60 fps animation, that might not be such a problem.<p>The CAShapeLayer issues only came up when I tried scrolling within a scroll view that contained a CAShapeLayer with a CGPath that had 20 points defining lines. Setting the CAShapeLayer to -shouldRasterize:YES after the animation completed ""fixed"" the issue, as long as you didn't need to scroll while the CAShapeLayer was animating.<p>(Don't even bother animating a CAShapeLayer while -shouldRasterize: is set to YES. That just causes even more fun problems with dropped frames.)",1369418353

5764363,comment,5763581,5763581,12,0,js2,,,"Of course, this doesn't address what I consider the greatest weakness in using ssh - distribution of host keys.<p>By design, ssh does not make use of certificates. So there is no way for ssh to know upon connecting to a host for the first time whether the public key presented by that host is authentic. After the first connection, ssh caches the keys in ~/.ssh/known_hosts, and will then give you a big warning if the key changes. I imagine when this happens many folks blindly delete the the cached key and re-connect.<p>So you should be aware of the potential for MITM attacks to occur unless you have some out-of-band mechanism for distributing or authenticating host keys.<p>Edit: huh, apparently ssh added support for certificates. ""ssh-keygen supports signing of keys to produce certificates that may be used for user or host authentication.""

Our customers are a special breed, I think, but there are some generalisations that can be made.<p>I sometimes heard (albeit very rarely) my coworkers ask ""Fiction or nonfiction?"" But that didn't necessarily increase sells from our observation and discussions we had about this approach. But some supervisors pushed this concept to ""get the conversation going"". Truth is, you need to be yourself when facing a customer. There are as many different customers as there are personalities in a workplace.<p>It's true that it depends on your customer. But most of them want to be left the heck alone. So what approach worked for me?<p>Asking a casual, open-ended question or making a comment about them. This allowed me to gauge whether this person wanted help or not. It worked most of the time. It's all about making the customer feel comfortable with you.<p>Casual questions/comments I would say:<p>1. Oh! I've heard a lot of good things about that book. Apparently [insert author/interesting book fact that doesn't reveal much of it]<p>2. Hey, how's it going?<p>3. Jesus, is it still pouring out there?<p>4. Hey, watchoo lookin for?<p>5. Okay, it looks like you are trying to find something (when they appear lost and are going in circles in place)<p>6. Hi. (simply acknowledging them -- you can tell they don't want to be talked to if they act distracted, make an effort to avoid eye contact or walk busily/quickly away from you)<p>In the end, every customer will find an answer to get out of any question, full stop. So don't try to fake it.<p>If they are already holding a book, that is the easiest target, because you can make assumptions about that person and start a genuine conversation.<p>Another is actually a close-ended question:<p>*What section are you looking for?<p>The trick there was the follow-up comment/question. Say they said ""history"". Okay. ""Oh, the new Trudeau biography just came out and the biographer had a bunch of access to documents and files which no other person has ever looked at"".<p>If they said ""Not sure"". A chuckle then ""Is it a gift or for a special occasion?"" Sometimes customers don't know what they are looking for, actually. You need to have an honest demeanour. In the end, I was always honest with the people I dealt with and had people visit me to talk to me. Probably half of us had degrees or were in the process of getting degrees so we had our own specialisations. I had a bunch of people who remembered me and we would recommend books to each other and just chat. I spoke for a couple of hours to customers about philosophy or Latin American literature and history. A few were extremely impressed with my knowledge and the same occurred with my other coworkers.<p>This building of rapport is the best thing, I think. Almost like selling is an afterthought. Humanising the transaction is better, I think. And something that I feel is lacking in a lot of customer service. We're all humans. All of us have our bad days.<p>If there was a customer looking for something I had no idea of, I'd think of someone who did know. And would tell them honestly, ""Actually, I have no idea about that, but I think my other coworker might. Let me call her/him"". If no one knew, which happened sometimes, we would try to help them the best we could. In a lot of these cases, we had no solution. But the customer was happy that we at least tried.<p>If we never stocked a particular book, we'd recommend them to another bookstore. We had a binder filled with different bookstores. Most were surprised we did this.<p>Despite all of this, this bookstore is one of the most hated in the city I lived in (if not the entire country). Poor management, too bureaucratic, and old habits. Plus, inconsistency between other locations (it is a chain bookstore).<p>The absolute worse thing about working there had to be PROMOS, as in, the giving out of flyers/coupons. Very, very, very, very few people like being handed stuff. And many customers knew we suffered (they could see it in our faces), so a minority took them out of sympathy. The biggest problem with this was that when giving the flyer there was an unspoken time frame to hand and explain the promotion. And this time frame was about 5 seconds or less, and usually there was a caveat to a promotion that required more time to explain, because it seemed like the nature of marketing was to purposefully create convoluted/complicated scenarios where the promotion would apply.<p>Anyway. My two cents. Sorry, it was an unabridged/unedited and not proofread response.",1369416810

If you need to take X units of Y bytes, and your integers are 32 bits, and X is big enough so that X * Y will not fit in 32 bits...  Then this problem has to exist somewhere - the machine will have to truncate the product into a 32 bit entity, the bit pattern of which is <i>a legitimate quantity</i> in its own right.  The allocator doesn't and can't know whether you <i>really</i> meant ""the lower 32 bits of X * Y"" or ""the product of X and Y"", because the former is a totally valid input.<p>You could very well make the same mistake in a higher level language since AFAIK most of them don't have arbitrary precision integers by default: create an array of a size based on an expression with an integer overflow.  The difference is that it will blow up in a ""safer"" manner when you index beyond the end of the array.  You could argue that this is the real benefit of the higher level language and perhaps you're right, but somebody at some layer of the system must implement that check; the machine does not have it as an inherent feature.",1369416685

I finely articulated my argument and you chose to focus on one sentence of my post out of context to make my position appear extreme. I agree that automation tends to create jobs, but that is not a law of nature. The combustion engine didn't create more jobs for horses, it dramatically cut their populations. In 1915 there were 21 million domestic horses in America, by 1960 there were 3 million because they were automated out of existence and only remain for recreational use.<p><a href=""http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=144565"" rel=""nofollow"">http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=144565</a><p>Now let's take one of Lanier's examples:<p>""Heres a current example of the challenge we face... At the height of its power, the photography company Kodak employed more than 140,000 people and was worth $28 billion. They even invented the first digital camera. But today Kodak is bankrupt, and the new face of digital photography has become Instagram. When Instagram was sold to Facebook for a billion dollars in 2012, it employed only 13 people. Where did all those jobs disappear? And what happened to the wealth that all those middle-class jobs created?""<p>So my honest question is this: How did digital photography, which put 140,000 people out of work and, as Yahoo's CEO correctly notes, eliminated the business of professional photography, create more jobs than it eliminated? How does an ATM machine, which replaces a dozen bank tellers, create more jobs than it eliminates? How does a shopping website, which eliminates a dozen local small businesses, create more jobs than it eliminates?<p>I want to believe this is all going to turn out okay, but I'm also watching private companies making record profits and the stock market shooting for the moon while unemployment numbers remain unchanged. I don't know how we are going to correct this or if our worldviews will allow us to even consider it a problem. We can't just dismiss anyone who points out these market shifts as a ""luddite"" and move on.",1369416534

Advertising and finance are both industries flush with relatively easy cash right now, of course people are going to seek out jobs in those areas.<p>> There's one other big cultural difference that has an affect on who wants to do tech startups. In SV people care about ""What can you do?/What have you done?"" where in NY it's more ""Where did you go to school?/What's your pedigree?""<p>That's true and is probably a bigger substantive differnce.

Similarly, structures are directly equivalent to the Cartesian product (although they are not named appropriately).<p>K&R were geniuses, not only in practical programming, but in the egg-head understanding of the mathematical theory behind programming languages.",1369415321

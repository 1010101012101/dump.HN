Corporate profits, and personal income invested in the stock market will rise with total nominal national income. In economics terms, nominal national income growth is proportional to the growth in the money supply (M*V=Y). So the growth in the stock market is just a result of the growth of the money supply. It has zippo to do with any real thing like productivity. That is why it is always silly when newscasters report the stock market changes every day, and view it as good when it rises, and bad when it falls. They are essentially cheering on monetary dilution. (But inflation always feels good in the short term, so they aren&#x27;t entirely wrong to cheer it on, it feels good when the stock market rises, even if the same underlying mechanic is also pushing up your milk price).",1438027191

9957620,comment,9954975,9954975,0,0,kazinator,,,"Using fixed point for drawing lines rather than Bresenham&#x27;s is nothing new.<p>The thing is that Bresenham is resolution-independent. If the registers used have enough width to represent the coordinates of the entire display, then the line will be drawn correctly. The error term that is propagated through the loop is always precisely correct. There is no cumulative error from using approximations.<p>You can think of Bresenham&#x27;s as being like fixed point, but with a variable denominator for the error term which depends on the specific delta.  For instance if we are drawing 600 across (x) and 450 up (y), then the error term is basically an accumulator to which we add 450. Whenever it goes over 600, we subtract 600, and increment y. (Okay, so it is not like fixed point but in fact exact rational math. The error term accumulates numerators, which are compared to the denominator.)<p>We could represent the same approximately with a fixed point number, but that pins us to a denominator. If we have, say, 8 bits of fractional precision, then we work in multiples of 1/256.    Now 450/600 is precisely 3/4, and so we are lucky in this case: 3/4 is a multiple of 1/256: the denominator is a power of two, and so we can step the x coordinate by 1, and the y coordinate by 3/4. The &quot;staircase&quot; will be the same as under Bresenham&#x27;s.<p>Suppose delta is <453,599>.  Bresenham&#x27;s still deals with this precisely. 453 is added to the error term, and 599 subtracted when it blows past 599. Yet, 599 is a prime, and 453/599 has no exact representation in fixed point. The best we can do is add more bits of precision to minimize the cumulative error. If the display is on the order of 1000x1000 and we go down to 1/65535 sub-pixel precision in our fixed-point coordinates, maybe there is no noticeable artifact.",1438027015

But there are multiple factors of production: labor, natural resources, zoned residential land near jobs. Plus there are other limits to production, such as monopolies and regulation. So if just automation improves, production only increases and prices only fall to a point, until natural resources, marketing, and monopoly profits make up the bulk of the cost. As a 22-year-old entering the job market, all you have is your labor to trade, but you need access to natural resources and constrained goods like housing. Since automation makes your labor less valuable, you actually need to work just as many hours or more to get the same purchasing power.

While at the same time, his defense counsel would have been free to recommend a sentence of probation. Ultimately, any sentence imposed would have been up to the judge.

I personally don&#x27;t care if I can&#x27;t review apps or create YouTube channels or do anything that requires Google+ as the features that have required it are mostly useless or I have found alternatives. It is annoying that I would even be asked to review apps constantly, however, when I&#x27;m not signed up for the idiotic Google+. I actually wouldn&#x27;t mind reviewing some apps, but not at the expense of having to start Google+. The Google+ fiasco has mainly hurt Google itself by making them lose all their customers who didn&#x27;t sign up for Google+ from such features as well as the unfortunate developers who rely on good app ratings that they won&#x27;t get now because Google essentially put up a nasty firewall around that system. Then again, there&#x27;s nothing new about Google or Apple pushing its own woes onto developers, so I assume mobile developers have made their peace with the tactics of their industry.",1438025424

In this frothy rebuke to me, you&#x27;ve claimed that the police in the article do not care about their personal safety much, yet the first comment you made is bitching about them putting their personal safety as a priority.<p>> It honestly sounds like they are so self-centered that they only care about their arrest stats/job performance + personal safety. They care nothing for anyone else&#x27;s safety if it gets in the way of their job performance numbers. That is a horrific concept, honestly.<p>I pretty much baldly stated they care about job performance numbers more than anyone else&#x27;s safety. I also focused on job performance over their personal safety.

Sega chose wisely all those years ago.</i><p>Kind of weird reading this. First because Nintendo also had a local partner during NES age with a company called Gradiente and launched a local version of NES called Phantom System. I owned one, and there was the traditional rivalry Sega vs Nintendo in the form of Master System vs Phantom System, with no clear winner as the article seems to assum.<p>The other weird part is that it look like a success Tec Toy still be selling Master System consoles and games for low income customers. But Tec Toy is a broke company, it filed for bankruptcy, and the shadow of a company that still exists today survives more from videoke machines and some local mobile gaming than from Master System current sales.<p>So my impression is that the article is more biased to corroborate its title than reality.<p>Edit: just learned that Gradiente&#x27;s Phantom System was a clone of NES, not a Nintendo&#x27;s local partner. So I retract that particular criticism. SEGA handled brazilian market better than Nintendo, but still Master System was not a clear winner versus Phantom System.<p>Edit2: Phanton System console for the curious: <a href=""http://s382.photobucket.com/user/Sr-Ferraz/media/NES%20Systems/GradientePhantomSystem2.jpg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s382.photobucket.com/user/Sr-Ferraz/media/NES%20Syste...</a>",1438025038

The indictment stated that between 2005 and 2010, Abacus sold hundreds of millions of dollars of fraudulent mortgages to Fannie, reaping many millions of dollars in commissions and fees.<p>The other article also has descriptions about the &quot;cooperation&quot; missing from the NYT article:<p>>  The Abacus clients whose aborted closing sparked Ken Yu’s termination lost their deposit on the property when the loan fell through. They went to the police and filed a complaint, mentioning that Yu had falsified their mortgage application. The police referred the matter to the DA. Abacus says it had already launched its own inquiry at this point, and that by mid-2010 it had hired two well-regarded fraud consultants, Vitale AML and the Mercadien Group, to do external investigations. The DA’s office declines to specify when its own investigation started, but says the bank only brought in the outside consultants after prosecutors started asking questions.<p>The NYT article also leaves out the gist of the reason the bank was indicted rather than just the individual employees:<p>> In April 2011, Yu pled guilty to grand larceny, fraud, and falsifying business records, and is cooperating with the investigation. Six others have also taken pleas. The DA’s argument is that fraud was standard operating procedure at Abacus, that it was taught there, not just tolerated. New employees with no banking knowledge and rudimentary English were instructed that mortgage origination was an act of financial sleight-of-hand: fake gift letters, fake verification of employment forms, blatant misrepresentations on loan application forms. The accused employees include Yiu Wah Wong, the bank’s chief credit officer, who reported directly to Jill Sung; and Wai Hung “Raymond” Tam, the loan origination supervisor, who trained the bank’s loan officers and processors. According to the indictment, the two managers “falsely told employees that the exceptionally low default rate of Abacus-originated loans made the underlying accuracy of loan documents insignificant.”",1438024784

(You could argue that Goldeneye and Perfect Dark on the N64 got there first, but Halo is the one that really moved the market to where it is now.) Then on top of that, they created Xbox Live, which has had at least as much impact on how we play games as Halo did. And you&#x27;re absolutely right that they lost money in the process.

9957332,comment,9954870,9955867,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"I think it was Microsoft that proposed an approach. They&#x27;d modify games to continually speculatively execute and render every user input. So that might be they render you beginning to run left/right/forward/back as well as jumping and shooting. When you actually change the input, a local device can switch streams and start speculatively executing all over again.<p>It probably works best if the game engine cooperates. But that&#x27;s not necessary. You can just split processes on the OS and run each different bit of user input in a different process with no cooperation from the process. (Though I admit this might be tricky on current hardware and heavy games.) Given enough compute and bandwidth, you could do this continually.<p>In theory, with unlimited compute/bw this means you can have local latency (just the cost of input/stream switching) because you <i>could</i> speculatively execute every possible input to the game, all the time, out to the latency duration. In practise, it&#x27;ll probably prune things based on the likely inputs and only speculate a bit out. This is probably enough to provide a smooth experience for most users that aren&#x27;t playing competitively.<p>If you think about a game as a mapping from a limited set of user inputs to a 2D image, some optimizations start coming out, I suppose.",1438024412

Chemical weapons have been long banned by the international community but they are still in use[0] in certain places.<p>Regardless, creating autonomous weapons is a very different beast. The systems that could be used for target could have been designed to locate all pedestrians, animals, cars, etc for autonomous driving / collision avoidance in. These advancements are going to happen and can easily be repurposed; chemical weapons many of the compounds are not easily re-usable for good things so they&#x27;re not comparable in that regard.<p>>  These things don&#x27;t appear out of thin air, they still have to be manufactured, sold and stored. If you can find them you can remove them, and deal with those who created them.<p>This is too idealistic and isn&#x27;t feasible. First, you&#x27;re assuming you can&#x27;t retrofit a computer system to any existing weapons (many of which require a small amount of control input from humans to move and fire). You can, very easily. In fact you can hook up computer systems to non-obvious weapons such as a handgun if you really wanted to. Second, who&#x27;s going to remove them and deal with them? There is evidence Syria and other countries have used chemical weapons but the World Police (tm) are not exactly knocking down their doors to arrest them.<p>Chemicals can be hard to manufacture and difficult to distribute. AI?

Your assumption is that the profit margin on labor is 0% which logic would suggest is pretty universally false.<p>Here&#x27;s my logic, maybe you can help me find the flaws in it: businesses are trying to maximize sales and minimize costs, which means they have the smallest possible workforce required to support their current sales. Less staff means less sales. They are also making some profit. As long as the wage increases are less than their profit margin, they have no reason to fire anyone. They lose revenue if they fire anyone, or they would&#x27;ve already done it.<p>So to me he relevant question is: what is the ratio between profit and minimum wages at most companies?

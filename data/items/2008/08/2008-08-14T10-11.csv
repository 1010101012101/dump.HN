275982,comment,275973,275973,0,0,cperciva,,,"First, kudos to Ume√• university for being forward-thinking enough to (gasp) allow you to own your own work.<p>To answer your question: If I were in your position, I'd try to work an option 1.5 -- see if you can take an unpaid leave of absence for 4 months and spend that time working on your startup.  Most universities are happy to let their faculty do this sort of thing, since they usually come back far more excited about their research than when they left.<p>Spend those 4 months working on your startup full-time, and plan on deciding at the start of the 4th month whether you're going to take your option 1 or your option 2.  I don't think you can really make a rational decision without working on this full-time for at least a few months.<p>Re your startup: Have you considered putting it together with freebase?  I don't know how structured your input databases need to be; but since freebase is basically wikipedia (EDIT: and apparently other data sources now, too) parsed and converted into a database, being able to run natural language queries against it could be very interesting...",1218711298

Some people will not use software because of that.<p>I'm not so much a zealot and would consider using Google Docs, if I could be sure my ""sensitive"" documents were only readable by myself. These documents, in particular, I would think, lend themselves to being a bit more private than your average college paper.<p>Also, Google Docs supports OpenDocument, at least according to WikiPedia (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_OpenDocument_software"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_OpenDocument_soft...</a>)",1218711210

A joint venture, perhaps.<p>Option 2 might be your only real option, but even then I would think you might be able to use your work as a springboard into something more lucrative...?",1218711050
275979,comment,275328,275493,0,0,apgwoz,,,"It's been a while since I've used a .doc on my personal computer, but when I do, I use Open Office. It's never understood .docs perfectly and has always been a pain to send back and forth to people. Now, I think I remember reading something about Microsoft ""opening"" it's formats, so maybe this is a non-issue these days?<p>Even still, in the more general case, the idea that a file format is locked up and has to be reverse engineered for some people to view/edit it always presents at least some problems for someone. Supporting open formats, while perhaps not as widely used right now, at least is a step in the right direction. Maybe Joe Hacker, whose been using MS Office all his life, gets curious when he sees a .odt. Maybe he looks it up and sees that he'd rather be apart of a movement to free the world of non-open/proprietary office file formats and makes a vow to only create documents in a free format like OpenDocument (and convert .docs to .odt). Maybe he tells all his friends and the demand for OpenDocument is increased.<p>Oh, and I hear Microsoft is supporting OpenDocument these days (at least via a plugin).",1218710811

275977,comment,275973,275973,0,0,davidw,,,"I don't know the details of the system you've created, but you could use a 'restrictive' open source license like the GPL, and offer a dual licensing strategy, where people who want to use it in commercial systems pay to get a compatible license.  That only works if it's a library though, rather than an independent system.<p>Another idea might be to find a partner first, and let that person handle most of the business, and just concentrate on the technical aspects of it.<p>Good luck!",1218710756

Maybe click the bookmarklet again or a timeout if you don't select an image after 15-30 seconds, it goes away.<p>Other then that, I like the design (and after reading the comments here, I could figure out what it did).",1218710543
275973,story,,,49,47,anaphoric,"Should I give up?",,"Hello All,<p>I would appreciate very frank advice on what I should do with my start up, Anaphoric Systems 
(http://www.anaphoric.com).<p>The whole effort started as a research project several years ago, but when I was informed that I actually owned the system, I entered a business plan competition and then started to execute on the plan.<p>The problem is that I have been wearing two hats: 'researcher/educator' and 'entrepreneur'. This has led to conflicts of interest as well as diluted effectiveness. So basically I need to decide if I am going to 1.) quit my tenured position, move to a start-up hub, find a partner, get-funding, etc. or 2.) open source the whole project and treat it as a research project. (It's 18k lines of LISP). I suppose in case 2 I could always do something commercial if the system was of high impact.<p>I am leaning toward option 2, but I thought I should run my plan by the YC community first.<p>Regards,<p>Michael Minock

275971,comment,275277,275966,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I wonder if a lot of this is simply a lack of good knowledge on what the differences are and how each system is flawed to one degree or another.<p>As in this thread, most people don't know the difference between a democracy and a representative republic, or why a bicameral legislature has certain values over a unicameral one.<p>As you point out, even in a representative republic, it becomes easily possible for representatives to compete to form voting blocks in an effort to get more resources than other voting blocks. It doesn't take very long for the system to begin eating itself.<p>""funadmentally incompatible"" seems a little extreme to me, but I'll agree there are worrying tendencies.",1218709909

People can vote things for themselves out of proportion to their own contribution or risk. It's valid to wonder, say, if people who aren't net contributors to the public purse should have a say in how it's spent.",1218708663

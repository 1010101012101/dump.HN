Though it was a phone interview on Hackerrank Codepair.<p>I was really nervous, and since it was a phone interview, I tried to speak my thought process, which didn&#x27;t quite work out due to me constantly stammering. So I just took to typing all the time so that my interviewer wouldn&#x27;t think I was taking too long coming up with a language or copying answers. I started making silly mistakes like using `int sum=0` in python. I took the input as a number, converted it to a string, and then further converted it back to a number, and did mathematical operations on it, trying to solve the problem. Every time I thought I did it, it would get stuck in another case.<p>Ultimately, the interviewer deleted 50 lines out of my 60-line code, and just added a print statement on a variable I was already using for storing things temporarily, which turned out to be the correct answer.<p>Needless to say, I blew the interview. I haven&#x27;t done an interview since, and I&#x27;m gonna be up for it very soon.

It certainly requires something more than a queue.&quot;<p>This is almost exactly the cross-DC replication problem, which is a subject of active research.<p>A changelog on the source side is only sort of helpful.  It&#x27;s useful to advise which rows may have changed, but given that you don&#x27;t trust the target database, <i>you also need to do repair</i>.<p>Correct repair is impossible without full syncs (or at least partial sync since known-perfectly-synced snapshot), unless your data model is idempotent and commutative.  On-the-fly repair requires out-of-order re-application of previous operations.<p>The easiest way to reason about commutivity is to just make everything in your database immutable.  So this is a solved problem, but it requires compromises in the data model that people are mostly unwilling to live with.<p>You can do pretty well if your target database supports idempotent operations.<p>If you&#x27;re trying to do pretty well, then you can do a Merkle Tree comparison of both sides at some time (T0 = now() - epsilon) to efficiently search into which records have been lost or misplaced.  Then you re-sync them.  Here, for efficency, your merkle tree implementation will ideally to span field(s) that are related to the updated_at time, so that only a small subset of the tree is changing all the time.  This is a tricky thing to tune.<p>You&#x27;ll still be &quot;open to odd inconsistencies when updates are applied out of order&quot; if you haven&#x27;t made your data model immutable, but I think this is mostly inline with your hopes.",1430613232

9479131,comment,9478442,9479061,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Because those fights are fought under different rules and with different styles because of the gloves. Many bare knuckle fights that&#x27;d last hours were because they lasted until either someone was dead or unconscious or quit, the notion of a ref stopping the fight once someone got a harsh cut didn&#x27;t exist. Beyond that, because of the risk of punching e.g. the jaw without gloves (it&#x27;ll break your hand fairly quickly) punches were directed more at the body, hence the boxing stance where the hands weren&#x27;t close to the head as much to protect it as it wasn&#x27;t necessarily the prime target in the bulk of the match.<p>Of course it&#x27;ll last longer, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;d last longer under similar rules and fighting styles as boxing is today.<p>My point is that 15 rounds of the type of punch volume to the head simply wouldn&#x27;t occur without gloves. It might still be a long fight, but you won&#x27;t get anywhere near the same type of volume to the head. Hell back in the day there was grappling, kicks and arm locks back in the day. Similar perhaps to MMA, punching the face wasn&#x27;t nearly as big a thing as it is in boxing today, and a big part of that is because of modern rules as well as boxing gloves.<p>And again as I mentioned earlier, it&#x27;s not the broken hands that count. (they can cause permanent damage, yes). It&#x27;s the permanent brain damage that is the biggest concern, and that risk has increased much more now that gloves make it possible to throw hundreds of punches to the jaw and not injure your hands.<p>If you&#x27;re trying to argue that I said that gloves extend fights longer than they did under bare-knuckle rules, you&#x27;re right, that&#x27;s not true and that wasn&#x27;t my point. What I meant to say is that they extend the fights in which fighters mostly punch to the face much longer than they normally could, and radically increase the volume of punches to the face (without reducing the impact to the brain, instead, increasing it, as the weight of the gloves increases the impact).<p>Although I think it&#x27;s probably possible to contest the following quote, it&#x27;s not far from the truth and illustrates the differences a bit:<p>> As the bare-knuckle campaigner Dr Alan J Ryan pointed out: &quot;In 100 years of bare-knuckle fighting in the United States, which terminated around 1897 with a John L Sullivan heavyweight championship fight, there wasn&#x27;t a single ring fatality.&quot; Today, there are three or four every year in the US, and around 15 per cent of professional fighters suffer some form of permanent brain damage during their career.",1430612035

It&#x27;s about observing your process, and trying to simulate what it would be like to work with you:<p>Do you approach a problem with caution until you&#x27;re sure you understand it, or jump in head first and start writing code you hope is correct? Can you verbalize your thought process and communicate it to others? How good are you at reasoning about the runtime behavior and correctness of your solution? Do you consider edge cases and naturally want to test them? Things like that are won&#x27;t show up in a take-home coding test, and tell me a huge amount about what kind of programmer you are, and whether I want to hire you.<p>See: <a href=""http://www.yacoset.com/Home/signs-that-you-re-a-bad-programmer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yacoset.com/Home/signs-that-you-re-a-bad-programm...</a> - there&#x27;s a lot of truth to this article, and many of these flaws will be glaringly obvious in a live coding session.<p>And yes, of course some people interview poorly or are just having a bad day. That&#x27;s unfortunate, but I&#x27;m not about to give up a powerful interview tool just because it can have false negatives. Until I find a divining rod that will point out the best programmer in a room, asking a candidate to write some code is the fastest way to learn what kind of programmer they actually are. (And also immediately weed out people who can&#x27;t actually write real code.)",1430611817

I didn&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s supposed to work as a basic filter so I was looking for some catch thinking that it cannot be as easy as it looks. As I couldn&#x27;t find any I figured out I should go with trying to write the prettiest, most elegant and clever way, started fiddling with modulo division and managed to screw it up under nerves and the fact that I was writing it on paper with no ability to run and check. Also, despite of being told &quot;use whatever language you want&quot;, for some irrational reason I worried about correct syntax, which probably added up to my nervousness.<p>Fortunately, they didn&#x27;t stop there and I was able to do harder tasks better later on ;)<p>I reacted pretty much in the same way on my driving exam.

Which makes it, in one sense, kind of like what ggplot2 was to R&#x27;s standard plotting tools.<p>However, Seaborn has a more object-oriented API, among other things:<p><a href=""http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/introduction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/introduction.h...</a><p>>  Seaborn’s goals are similar to those of R’s ggplot, but it takes a different approach with an imperative and object-oriented style that tries to make it straightforward to construct sophisticated plots. If matplotlib “tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible”, seaborn aims to make a well-defined set of hard things easy too.<p>There already is an attempt to port ggplot over to Python, and its authors&#x27; opinion is that its API should look like R&#x27;s ggplot2, which means the syntax is not Pythonic: <a href=""http://ggplot.yhathq.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ggplot.yhathq.com/</a>",1430611664

Instead of focusing on the audience and their talk immediately, they first drink a glass of water slowly. It lets you set your own pace, and deal with the first high of adrenaline a little.<p>In this case, they asked you a question and you immediately fired up a repl and started typing away as if it&#x27;s a race. But if no one is holding a stop watch it&#x27;s not really a race. If you&#x27;re going to have to do this kind of interview more often, perhaps practice on your generic problem solving strategy.<p>If it were me, I&#x27;d probably ask for a piece of paper, and then write down the components of problem on the highest level, then drill down the details of each component. At each level of detail check with the interviewer if the requirements of the component match their intentions. When you&#x27;re confident you&#x27;ve got the algorithm down on paper, then you can start on working it out in the REPL.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not a LISPy guy so no idea how you usually do this, but those first three mistakes you made were horrible. Obviously you were nervous, but these kinds of mistakes don&#x27;t happen if you have a good IDE and disciplined code style. You can&#x27;t miss matching brackets if every opening bracket starts a new line and a new indentation level. You can always clean up the new lines when your algorithm is done.<p>Practice and preparation are the best countermeasure to stress.<p>Not that I agree with this interview style at all by the way. You are most likely an excellent developer, and if they don&#x27;t decide on hiring you they probably are making a big mistake. If I was hiring Clojure people I&#x27;d be surprised I&#x27;d get someone that would work a REPL like that without internet reference at all.",1430611215

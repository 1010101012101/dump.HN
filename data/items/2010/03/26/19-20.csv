While I obviously can't verify that I'm personally inclined to believe it. Since even restaurants have regulations which force them to have toilets when they are over a certain size I can't imagine this idea would be legal. If it is then it'd only be a matter of time before someone who had one too many coffees before getting on board sued them for breaching their human rights by not letting them go to the toilet!<p>I'd agree Ryanair take the opposite model from what was described in this article but they have also highly optimized their approach.

1221921,comment,1221252,1221620,0,0,raganwald,,,"> Now anything pro-China is tainted.<p>Why? An argument is an argument is an argument. If it holds water, let it carry the water. Saying that a pro-China argument is tainted just because there is a possibility that the person making the argument is paid to make the argument is fallacious, it's a kind of reverse Appeal to Authority.<p>Of course, there are certain arguments that are tainted. For example,if someone says ""I counted 280,000 signatures on this Kick Google Out of China petition,"" that argument is suspect. As is the ""My friends and everyone I know see no value in Free Speech"" anecdotal argument.<p>And I'm sure there are some others that are subject to scrutiny.

People will tend to buy things with more features because it has more features that they might someday want. The key is complexity. If it's simple to use despite those extra features (or because of them), then they're a benefit. If they make the product harder to use or slower, it's a drawback.<p>In Japan, the cell phone industry is the logical extreme of this. People cycle phones at ridiculous intervals to get more and better features, most of which don't work well or at all, and all of which make the phone more complicated to use.

1221873,comment,1220883,1220948,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I'm not in favor of that, actually. A single set of regulations is much better than 50 different ones. A similar approach was tried when the credit card market was liberalized, and the outcome was that all the CC issuers just set up Delaware corporations because Delaware had no cap on the amount of interest issuers could charge.<p>(EDIT: it's not <i>quite</i> that simple - besides Delaware, Utah and South Dakota also offered regulatory environments with no 'usury' caps on interest rates. Please read 'Delaware' as shorthand for 'states with lender-friendly regulations' and bear in mind the summary nature of this already-too-long post. Thanks.)<p>Now, nobody is forced to acquire or maintain a debt with a credit card, but on the other hand it's rather difficult to build up a credit rating without using credit. To build up a good credit rating, you need to demonstrate the ability to take out a lot of credit. Not having a good credit rating, or not using credit at all and thus not having a rating, imposes all kinds of annoying difficulties - leasing an apartment usually requires a credit check, so do many kinds of employment, and so on. You are administratively penalized, with a resulting economic cost, if you do not show a willingness to incur a significant amount of debt. To my mind this is perverse.<p>But if you accept the fact and participate by opening and maintaining a credit facility, Delaware law gives card issuers a great deal of freedom to change the terms of your credit arrangement by fiat, such as raising or lowering your credit limit on a whim. Quite a number of people with perfectly good credit who made only cautious use of their credit facilities have lately received letters from their card issuers advising them that their limits had been adjusted sharply downward, often to just above the amount of credit outstanding; as a direct result, their credit score has in many cases been simultaneously adjusted downward because they are suddenly using a much higher percentage of their available-but-newly-reduced credit, despite not having spent any extra money. Unsurprisingly, a good many people have inadvertently found themselves exceeding the newly-reduced credit limit, incurring a $35 or more fee each time (which is added to the amount outstanding) and causing their score to be revised downward (in addition to any other downward revision which took place as a result of the limit reduction). And having your credit score go down is typically cited as justification for a lender to increase the rate of interest you must pay. Indeed, many lenders cite such changes on <i>other</i> lenders' credit facilities as justification to adjust their own terms, regardless of an individual's payment history on their own account.<p>Furthermore, as there are no interest caps under Delaware regulation, many people find themselves saddled with an APR of up to 30%, at a time when the federal funds rate is effectively zero. This isn't illegal but it is massively punitive. It's many times more than the IRS would demand on an outstanding tax debt, for example. Especially so if you were making relatively cautious use of your available credit, only for your card issuer(s) to cut your credit limit in half and jack your rate up from a 'reasonable' 17 or 18% to 29.99%, as described above. Through no fault of the borrower and with no change in their income and expenditure patterns, creditors have had, and freely exercised, the ability to significantly increase a borrower's immediate liability while simultaneously raising their risk of default from probabilities of 0.5 all the way up to 1.<p>My personal experience in recent years consists of opening a small credit facility after having avoided any debt for years, managing it somewhat poorly (though in mitigation, this occurred after an unforseeable medical emergency requiring surgery), being penalized as a result, and paying off and cutting up the cards later that year. Now I am fairly financially secure again and unsurprisingly being bombarded with more offers than a sailor on shore leave.<p>A family member with outstanding credit and and an absolutely perfect payment history (ie no rolling balance at all - in the CC industry such people are referred to as 'deadbeats' because they pay off their credit in full every month and thus generate no income for the issuers) saw their limits revised sharply downwards to just above the amount of the balance they typically accumulate during their grace period, presumably in the hope that they'd bump against the newly-lowered ceiling and set off revenue-generating triggers such as overlimit fees.<p>This is a very long way of saying that if we shift to a competitive regulatory model, the result will very likely be a stampede towards whichever jurisdiction offers the greatest opportunities for unilateral advantage. Startups will find themselves unable to attract investment participation on any other terms, but will have to set up a shell company and issue their PPM in whichever state confers the greatest advantages to investors. In other words, almost nobody will be prepared to cut a check unless the startup is incorporated in XX state whose regulations will be binding upon founders seeking capital. If the experience of the credit industry is any guide, this is a recipe for reverse takeovers and worse, by allowing investors to change the terms of their investment by fiat, file a claim of default or material breach of the investment terms about 30 seconds later, eject the founders and capture the IP.<p>Sounds apocalyptic, eh? Sure it does, but few people (other than those lobbying for it) foresaw the evolution of the credit industry when interstate barriers were lifted. Well, you say, investors won't be able to buy in if startups refuse to subject themselves to such onerous terms by setting up and issuing their PPM in such jurisdictions. Riiight....like you can tell the bank you'll only accept credit issued under California law (which IIRC does not allow the freedom to set any interest rate the issuer likes) instead of Delaware law. When you need a significant amount of external capital, you have to go where the money is.<p>Now, I do agree with the poster elsewhere on that thread who said that changes in the law might encourage startups focus more on organic growth than early-stage capital formation. That might indeed be a Good Thing. But sometimes you have to spend money to make money, and choosing the organic growth route comes with an opportunity cost which is an indirect barrier to entry. While you're feeding and watering your green shoots and waiting for your revenue to grow from a trickle to a stream, there's a much greater likelihood of an astute and well-financed competitor spotting the new market you have created and buying up all the surrounding territory without the bother of going through the acquisition process.",1269632199

Use cases that are not a blog, digg, or twitter clone would be most helpful. Some of us have to work outside the bay area for companies like banks, insurance companies, hospitals, etc... Can I use Cassandra as a data warehouse for electronic medical records? Hell if I know, without actually having to learn it and implement it to see if it works.",1269630692

1221788,comment,1221094,1221094,0,0,ccc3,,,"Increasingly it seems that ""entrepreneurship"" is becoming synonymous with ""internet software startup,"" which I find very troubling. It's critically important to recognize that web startups are in a unique position compared to almost every other type of business.<p>In a web startup it can often take roughly the same amount of time to make a first version of the product as it would to write a business plan. When time to make a product or a plan are equal, the relevant question becomes obvious: Will I learn more from making and testing V1 or from making a business plan? But there are very few other business categories where there is parity between the resources required to write the business plan and the resources required to create the product.  For example, I work on electro-mechanical systems which often have multi-year development cycles. In our case the relative cost of a business plan is very low, even if we only gain 10-20% additional knowledge about the venture.<p>The value of a business plan is also likely to be tied to the volatility of the market that the business is entering. Web-based businesses are outliers in terms of market stability as well. Given how quickly the web is changing, a plan would likely contain outdated information before it was even completed. But if you're starting a restaurant the costs are much more stable and there's no reason you couldn't figure them out before spending any money.",1269630549

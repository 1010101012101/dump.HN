53733,comment,53708,53708,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It's easier than ever to build web applications.  And cheaper than ever to hire people to make them for you (see: Digg, MySpace).<p>I've encouraged folks who aren't technical to pursue their (seemingly good) ideas in the past...so far, not much has come of it.  But I don't think it's because it is impossible for a non-technical founder to guide a good product into existence.  It seems likely that the people just didn't have the necessary drive or were too risk averse to spend the few thousand bucks it takes to build something.<p>But, when I see a fundamentally technical startup (which any web application is) without any technical founders, I also assume that it is destined for failure.  You need to contribute something to the equation.  A good idea isn't even a start.  It can be something as simple as money (a few thousand bucks can start something), design ability, good industry contacts in your target market, etc.  But you need something that random dude on the street doesn't have, or else there's no way you're going to win against the dozen or so hackers who have the same idea right now (or have it five minutes after they see your shoddy implementation of the idea).<p>So, I guess my answer is a resounding: Maybe.",1189579917

It is so incredibly easy to aggregate anything form the web today that I simply miss your value proposition.

You are asking the user to perform a very trivial stage in the registration procedure. If the font boldness, and not that, was the first thing that came to mind, I suggest hiring someone else to do the design.<p>If I sound spiteful, it's because I'm envious. The thought of making a meta-social-network crossed my mind, but it never occurred to me why anyone would want to use it, especially at the start. Feeds! Duh. ",1189578787

Networking involves enough pre-meeting prep to enable a non-trivial agenda.  Post-networking, there will be a debriefing to evaluate whether you achieved your goals and possibly what to do about it.  You may not achieve said agenda every time, but if you do, that will often result in work that you have to do for the startup.  If it rarely does, then either you're not very good at networking or you're not networking for the startup.<p>So, let's hear more about the value of this networking to the startup.<p>

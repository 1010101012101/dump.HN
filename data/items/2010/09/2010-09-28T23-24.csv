1737798,comment,1736055,1736055,0,0,jjcm,,,"I'm a web/logo designer, and here's why this is wrong:<p>First off it's trying to apply the rules that dictate one medium to another. While certain basic principles often transverse mediums, this does not. They're trying to state that what works for blending colors in an art medium will work for trying to convey information on a content delivery medium. Remember though that in impressionist paintings the focus is on the lighting and the brush strokes, generally with an ordinary subject matter - or rather, the focus wasn't on the information, but on how it was presented. This is almost entirely opposite to what the web brings to the table - the focus is on the information, with the presentation being a way to best show that information. If you focus on the design over the content, you'll end up with a pretty site, but one that isn't functional. As programmers and hackers, all of you should know how well that ends up.<p>Also though, keep in mind that Monet was one painter out of millions using one style out of thousands. What about ink and wash paintings (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink_and_wash_painting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink_and_wash_painting</a>)? Their entire focus is on the subtle and effective use of absolute black. Remember that there is no universal dos or donts in design, just guidelines. Saying you should ""never use black"" (or any color for that matter) is like saying you should never use X tool in your arsenal. You should never purposefully limit your tools, rather you should learn how to effectively use all the tools you have. Given the right conditions, even a goto statement can be the correct choice.",1285718152

As a disclaimer, I'll say right now that I do not believe the state should play any role in redistributing wealth.<p>My suspicion is that this study has been presented and promoted as justification for increased taxation of the wealthy.  Of course, increased taxation of upper quintiles won't actually change the distribution of wealth unless the government directly transfers the proceeds of increased taxation to those in the lower quintiles.  But that won't happen. Instead, the increased taxes would be used to give those in the lower quintiles services that the government has decided they need (or to further subsidize corn farming or other friends of the party in power).<p>As a thought experiment, I wonder how many people would support a proposal to take the aggregate payroll of their local NFL/NBA/MLB/NHL franchise, and distribute it evenly among all of the players on the team roster.

And as I have observed elsewhere, doing absolutely nothing to trim its own spending.<p>Doubtless you also have a justification for things like $38,000 tax breaks on Hummers - <a href=""http://www.seattlepi.com/local/104601_hummer17.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seattlepi.com/local/104601_hummer17.shtml</a><p><i>Sure I can - the recession ended a year ago. More to the point, the spending isn't going down post-recession.</i><p>Right, because demand and thus growth are well known for immediately returning to their previous levels following a recession. And increasing your spending at the same time you cut taxes, using borrowed money, is fiscally responsible and doesn't have the slightest impact on future budgets.<p><i>You're claiming that the rich aren't paying enough. I'm pointing out that they're paying more than they did before.</i><p>a) No I'm not, I think everyone is going to have to pay some more taxes;<p>b) They're paying more in nominal terms because they have a greater share of national income. Let's consider an example.<p>I am rich, you are not. My income works out at $1,000/day, yours is more like $200/day. I pay, say, $400/day in taxes, you pay something like $50. We are more or less OK with that.<p>Then I fire you (and a lot of other people) and outsource your factory job to someone in Asia, who is willing to work for $20/day and pays no US income tax. You get another job, probably at a Walmart, that pays $100/day and now you only pay $10 of it in taxes, mostly payroll. My income has gone up to $2,000/day and I'm paying $700 of that in taxes (because the tax rate got cut a little bit, from 40% to 35%).<p>I think it's just terrible that I'm paying an extra $300 in taxes already and now Obama wants to put it up to a total of $800, which will leave me taking home only twice as much as I was before. You should feel sorry for me, because you are 80% better off than you were before: you used to pay $50 in taxes, but now you only pay $10, you freeloader. My taxes are 70 times higher than yours, and Obama wants to make it 80 times higher.<p>Stupid, right? But that entire last paragraph is technically true. It just invites you to forget, briefly, about the changes in how much we take home each day. If I'm feeling particularly lucky, I might try changing the subject to something else, and then reminding you of how little you earn so I can attribute the blame to Obama for that, too.",1285716626

Some inequality of wealth distribution is a good thing; concentration of extreme percentages of total wealth into a tiny fraction of the populace is a bad thing.<p>A good explanation of the difference this makes shows up in chapter 3 of de Tocqueville's ""Democracy in America"", where he discusses the impact of different inheritance laws on American and European society. The traditional European system of primogeniture created and favored hereditary aristocracy; the American system of division among multiple heirs made this impossible, and created more opportunities for social mobility since wealth could not be hoarded across generations, but instead was gradually distributed through the effects of the inheritance laws.",1285715861

He may come across as arrogant for pointing to Apple et al. as example of great product but his point really is about experiencing a great product and to duplicate this feeling/experience to his product.  For example, the unwrapping experience of an iPod does not show up on a feature list but damm, it feels good to open that box because Apple took the effort to make it seem like you're open a present.  He should've point to Google Search as another example of great experience.  I remembered my virgin search with Google.  Relative to other search engine at the time, Google was insanely fast and relevant.  Do you remember?  if not Google, there must be some products that you fell in love with, now ask yourself if it was the feature list or the experience that you love.  btw, having the right feature set at the right moment is part of experience.<p>Sachin got nothing to apologize for, Posterous is one of the great product out there.

Apple could include thermosensors, audiosensors, or miniature holographic projectors. It could go towards flexible screens or wearable computing.<p>But new hardware is buggy before it's commoditized. The reason Apple's touch sensitivity is so good is in part because they control both the hardware and software layers. Any kind of temporal or spatial variation in touch detection at the hardware layer due to manufacturing issues can be corrected at the software layer.<p>It's that vertical systems integration which lets them push the envelope on technology. Others can easily copy, but they will only be followers unless they play to their strengths (e.g. Android with search).",1285715503

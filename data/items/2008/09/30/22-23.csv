Rather than consulting for Arthur Andersen or being a PM at Microsoft, they did interesting things sooner.  Like starting a cool company.  Or driving a taxi.  You could say it removes the band-limiter from your career possibilities.",1222815389

What, do you expect the candidates not to accept money from people just because they work for a given corporation?<p>If I worked for Fannie Mae and gave a hundred dollars to McCain, does that somehow affect what McCain thinks of Fannie Mae?  I don't think so.",1222815138

320121,comment,319847,320065,0,0,mpk,,,"> Or, would you explain the principle argument against it, aside of the standards bit?<p>Flash is a proprietary runtime. That means Adobe has to support whatever platform you're running at the moment.<p>Flash support for linux has only recently become somewhat decent. And that's IA32 - if you're running a 64-bit OS on your 64-bit processor, you have to use the IA32 compatibility libraries to run flash. If, for whatever reason, you decide to go with NetBSD/SPARC64 - you don't have flash.<p>You do, of course, have all the open web technologies because you simply recompile them for your platform.<p>Flash is proprietary and tying yourself to that runtime will restrict not only your choices, but also the direction the web takes.<p>The exact same holds true for Silverlight.<p>I left out standards and their long-term development, because you specifically requested it, but that's also a major factor.",1222814716

320102,comment,319780,320032,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"Last summer, I started working on x264, the only open source H.264 video encoder.  I knew basically nothing and was experimenting with the simplest things and harassing the only other active developer for explanations.<p>Slowly but surely, I learned the codebase.  Eventually, I got my first major patch in: a modification to the subpixel motion search that improved efficiency a bit.  But I still found myself blackboxing most of the code due to lack of understanding.  Bit by bit, I made more and more complex changes.  I taught myself x86 assembly, and then SIMD assembly.  I finally learned the subtleties of C pointers.  I finally realized that the best way to learn how things work is to identify some way to improve them, and then go and do it--the process of doing it will eventually teach you how it works, even if solely by forcing you to ask an enormous number of questions.<p>By late winter 2007-8, I probably knew the codebase better than anyone else in the world except the main developer, Loren Merritt, who had been the sole maintainer for almost three years.  I was still learning new things all the time, of course, and his knowledge vastly eclipsed mine.  But this limited knowledge of mine got me a contract from Avail Media, who wanted an adaptive quantization algorithm implemented, primarily to stop the problem of flat textured areas being blurred out (such as grass in football games).  Bit by bit I tried various ideas, and finally got a working algorithm in January that did the job tremendously well.  This was committed into x264 in April.<p>I then got another contract from them to improve the VBV compliance (buffering for constant and limited max bitrate encoding), since they're interested in x264 for television broadcast purposes.  I worked on this, which was eventually later improved upon by Gabriel (an employee of Joost, a company that uses x264) and turned into a complete overhaul to the buffering system, which resulted in much improved compliance.<p>Finally, I got hired for a summer internship there at a rather decent salary.<p>In the meantime, Adobe had released the latest version of Flash 9, which supported H.264 video.  Suddenly, thousands upon thousands of websites were interested in switching--the old FLV1 video format was simply awful, and VP6 was only mildly better and, unlike FLV1 and H.264, very expensive to license.  There was a massive flood of people looking for assistance integrating x264 into their toolchains--there simply was no practical proprietary alternative for the vast majority of these websites.  Most of the low-cost proprietary H.264 encoding apps were non-commercial only (and much inferior to x264) and the higher-cost ones were simply way out of their price range (and arguably mostly inferior too...).<p>So, as a developer of x264, I was in demand.  I knew the application better than almost anyone else.  Everyone wanted me to help them.  I got contract offers from Criterion Collection, Facebook, and others.  There were also loads of smaller sites looking for more minor help, or even just quick guidance on IRC.  x264 is now far beyond a tool for DVD backups, anime, and Scene releases; it was a standard tool used far and wide.  And again, I am one of only two active developers.  Furthermore, after over a year of being involved in development, I basically made myself an expert in both x264 and the H.264 standard, now knowing most of the code backwards and forwards and having read most of the spec at one point in time or another.<p>And what about the other developers I mentioned?<p>Well, the main developer was very difficult to motivate.  He didn't seem to care much about money, and had a habit of blowing off past contracts.  If you can convince him that some of his assembly code is suboptimal though, he'll be right on it ;)<p>There were many other minor developers--mostly people who submitted bugfixes or worked on one portion of the code.  For example, Gabriel worked primarily on ratecontrol and buffering, which was the most important thing given his job.<p>And thus I was left as the single developer who was willing to take all sorts of contracts, available to do them, and with enough expertise to deal with almost any part of the application, code-wise, algorithm-wise, or simply usage-wise.",1222812587

This must've completely confused the import system, sometimes displaying my complete work history and ratings, sometime not.<p>Also, getting the system to even let me login was already quite an undertaking - it won't let you log in with an account name starting with a number (guess what my accountname started with..) and yet, at the very same time, will happily let you password reset your account and will log you in initially after doing the password reset dance - i've gotta admit that had me pretty confused for a while.<p>So by now i've been able to log in to my account - which is, as of now, still pretty useless as much of the chance to get a freelancing gig depends on your ratings and positive reviews of previous employers (needless to say). The account i now can and could use hasn't had anything attached to it - it was just as empty as a new one, so i figured i'd ping their support staff to ask them about it.<p>I've contacted them on 3rd January about it and after them giving me the ""you sure you typed your password correctly and this is how you reset it"" routine i've since tried to explain to them what has happened.<p>After a few tickets back and forth i've chosen a new name and told them about the old accounts which needed to be merged which was still on the same day (props to them for that).<p>However, things got quiet quickly and after asking them twice, once on the 5th (still hoping for a quick resolution) and once on the 20th, my accounts still haven't been merged as of today - over a month later!<p>Their last non-automated response also was on the 20th January and i've since more or less abandoned all hope to get years of work history and positive reviews from happy clients reappear - hopefully this will get someone (mattbarrie?) to look into it :( (Ticket-ID: MCK-898-44151)<p>If you got that far, thanks for reading and letting me vent my anger a bit.",1360212772

5180583,comment,5180112,5180506,10,0,simonsarris,,,"I don't think its unavoidable but I do think its a hard problem to solve. Still I can think of a few games that did a very good job.<p>I haven't played these sorts of games in the past few years so most of these won't be modern, but off the top of my head I think Deus Ex 1 and Human Revolution (the new one), System Shock 2, Thief 1+2, BioShock all did well at making me forget that I was playing essentially an on-rails shooter.<p>Gameplay can be linear and that's fine. Novels are linear and they surprise us all of the time. When gameplay is linear you can still feel like <i>what's being done to you</i> isn't, and that's important and I think HL2 just plain skipped it.<p>All the game above are more or less linear, but they <i>feel</i> very different in terms of intrigue, character development, consistent pacing, and expressive emotions. Also, in every one of these examples who your character was mattered a good deal to the game.<p>Instead of hand-held waypoints, all of them offered an interesting world and we <i>knew</i> that we knew little about it, but we could <i>feel</i> that it was so damn large and scary.<p>The Thief universe for example was just plain incredible. Medieval setting with a small dash of newfangled machinery and magic, but unlike space robots or typical games with mages, both were powerful forces that are <i>not well understood.</i> You don't get to play badass wizard. You can't control these forces. But they're there, lumbering and wheezing.<p>There appear to be gods, but they are not all-powerful and somewhat stay out of the way of humans. For all we know there were once hundreds of gods, and they have been beaten into submission by mankind and no longer show their faces. You get the feeling you're not let in on everything. Moral ambiguity abounds.<p>You creep around looking for entrances, secrets and information. Most of the story development is gotten by way of eavesdropping. Nothing is just plopped in front of you like I felt for the entirety of Half-life 2. There's so much intrigue, and at times you really feel like you're in on something, part of this crazy, wide world filled with wonders and horrors. You get to fear it, but at least you have your shadows, so it still gets to fear you.<p>Half Life 2 was a joke in comparison. You're treated like a kid. You walk into a shitty house and some clown colonel (Odessa Cubbage) hands you an RPG, and lo' a gunship, go nuts kid, there's infinite ammo in the box over there. I'll wait out back.<p>Can you imagine storyboarding that? I hope to god it was more interesting than ""well we got the car plot device out of the way. What's the next thing the player needs to check off?""<p>But the end result wasn't.<p>(all this criticizing leaves a dirty taste in my mouth.

Just like real life, everything gets muddied, but you have far more people in the conversation that would be practical in reality.<p>* Track it but try to hide it (eg. Twitter). Discussions have tree structures, but you can only have a flat view of them. You have to manually sift through replies to find the branching points and then trace it from there.<p>For example, these are two discussion trees branching from the same conversation starter:<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/lgarvey/status/279088834115940352"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/lgarvey/status/279088834115940352</a><p><a href=""https://twitter.com/nitecoder/status/279088173743747072"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/nitecoder/status/279088173743747072</a><p>In any case, I suspect Discourse's threading mostly stems from Jeff Atwood's dislike of threading: <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/12/web-discussions-flat-by-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/12/web-discussions-fla...</a>",1360210346

I know BoA had a system like that years ago.<p>I will say now that if you are _only_ showing the image to cookied users, then I don't have a problem with it.<p>I just reread the blog post to see how it is described there and the author doesn't make the distinction. But I can see both the username and the security phrase in the screenshots and you say that they come from Ally Bank (or another bank using the same software, I guess). So my criticism stands for the system _described_ in the blog post but not the one depicted.<p>As for the charge of cynicism: fair because I didn't go into any details. For the compliance angle, I was relying on this comment further down [1]. As far as marketing goes, it's similar to the little SSL padlock/shield icons on the bottom of a page. It's just theatre. Well, in fact they are supposed to be links to authenticating sites, but in practice it's all about assuaging users' concerns.

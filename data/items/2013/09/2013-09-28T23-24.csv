The average person does not understand all of the ramifications of the license.  Here&#x27;s a scenario that hinders the distribution of open source software:<p>Teacher: Here, children.  Here is some free software.
Parent of child: Thanks.  It is GPL.  Give me the source.
Teacher: Huh?<p>There needs to be a license that is similar to the GPL in scope but is readable and clear about what is required to a person who has never compiled software in their life and is not a lawyer.  Open source projects need to realize that not everybody is a software engineer.  Not everybody is up to date on the latest terminology.  If they want laypeople to download and distribute code, make it easy to get.  And above all, communicate clearly in language they can understand.",1380412789
6463546,comment,6463394,6463514,26,0,e12e,,,"I think the GPL is widely misunderstood by developers. The freedom the GPL is concerned with, and the reasoning behind it, is to preserve the rights and freedoms of the user.<p>That is, when you acquire a product (for free, or for a fee) -- it seeks to make sure that you can do use that product as you wish. And that if you re-sell it, or share it, those same rights are available for the next user down the line.<p>The GPL achieves this by bending copyright into copyleft. It is not concerned with allowing people to make money repackaging a piece of software and locking it down in various ways.<p>So, it <i>is</i> all about freedoms, just maybe not the freedoms that some developers thinks it is/should be about.",1380412756

This article is written exactly how he speaks, so the tone and cadence are much more dynamic if you have the proper background.<p>I have to say that Stallman very recently inspired me to start contributing to open source projects. A few weeks ago, I made my first (one word, lol) contribution to an open source project on Github. As minor of a fix as my code was, it felt really great to be part of something like that. It also caused me to do a lot of introspection: I found myself, up until that point, becoming flat-out bored with &quot;consuming&quot; content. I now find myself, rather than frequenting (ok, I still frequent) HN, looking for open questions on StackOverflow to answer or finding open source projects to contribute to. I wonder if that&#x27;s a sign that, eventually, communities like Reddit and HN will be usurped by social media sites that focus less on consumption and more on contribution. Based on my recent experiences with contribution, I strongly encourage everyone else to do the same; it&#x27;s really a much more rewarding way to procrastinate!",1380412693

6463536,comment,6461936,6463027,3,0,cicatriz,,,"I&#x27;ve been thinking about this for a while--I created a spaced repetition system to digitize and learn material in college (alas, I don&#x27;t use it anymore). I have a philosophical approach to the question here (also cited in Gwern&#x27;s article): <a href=""http://blog.learnstream.org/2012/08/spaced-repetition-in-natural-and-artificial-learning/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.learnstream.org/2012/08/spaced-repetition-in-nat...</a><p>Your distinction between learning facts and learning ways of thinking is interesting. Most of the spaced repetition research and design is around fact recall--what&#x27;s called &quot;paired associates&quot; because you recall some response paired with some stimulus. I don&#x27;t have any evidence for it, but I&#x27;d say that the schema can be lost just as well as facts can be.<p>One thing I will say is that spaced repetition is generally known for the repetition--that you retain something over time, and the spacing is more thought of as convenience. But the truth is that spacing is also part of better learning--when recall is difficult it&#x27;s learned better (called &quot;desirable difficulties&quot;). I thought of that because Robert Bjork does that research with skills as well as facts.

However, I&#x27;d like to criticize one specific part of this essay: the claim that Chrome auto-updates are a &quot;universal backdoor&quot;.  Although silent updates tend to viscerally feel a bit creepy, they differ little in practical consequence from regular click-through ones: it&#x27;s not like most users verify the binaries of every package update on their system, so having the user click through just makes an attacker with a fake update wait a little longer.  Note that Chrome auto-updates can be turned off, and both the updater and the updated software are (mostly) open source and you are free to compile your own version, so it&#x27;s hard for me to see the problem.<p>(for the record - it <i>would</i> be nice to have a system to prevent one server from distributing malicious updates to one user, perhaps by verifying with multiple independently owned servers.  However, I do not know of any mainstream software that does that, including free Linux distributions, so it&#x27;s unfair to criticize Chrome for the lack.)",1380412542

She would too if her article was published in the NY Times. She seems to be playing identity politics in a situation that doesn&#x27;t warrant it: Perhaps she was unlucky in her career? Perhaps Eggers has better agents? Perhaps Eggers is a better writer, or has more experience? Perhaps Eggers&#x27; brother works at the NY Times? I would posit that, in this case, it&#x27;s unlikely that Eggers had his piece published and got away with ripping off her article because he is a white male.<p>I recognize that sexism and racism definitely exist in Silicon Valley, but the problem she&#x27;s trying to point out is broader  it&#x27;s the overzealous linguistic bullshit promoted throughout culture (and that includes other industries, mind you).

Facebook&#x27;s mantra started in the context of writing internet software. Minorities and women have little disadvantage in that specific context. The problem rose when the life advice language got so widespread (applied to every possible situation in Medium blog posts) as to become meaningless. Now she&#x27;s pissed off because minorities and women can&#x27;t get away with breaking things and asking for forgiveness in all areas of life, but young, white men can...and that&#x27;s exemplified through the popular philosophy of Silicon Valley. First, that again is so broad as to be meaningless (e.g. I can think of plenty of examples where being a young woman let&#x27;s you get away with things others&#x27; can&#x27;t). Second, &quot;act first and then ask for forgiveness&quot; and related Ferrissisms are all tropes carried over from other industries and books (ever heard of &#x27;sales&#x27;?).

The data includes whether a child was breastfed.<p>After reading the article I did some very quick computations and my finding based on the model I developed is that children who were not breastfed have an IQ impairment in the 1-3 IQ points range, after accounting for confounding factors.<p>This is very consistent with the results published here.<p>Compared to this study, I believe the methodology I&#x27;m using is more powerful for three reasons:<p>- much larger sample size: the dataset I have access to comprises 12015 children, compared to 3493 for the study<p>- a larger set of confounding factors is accounted for: notably, the data includes height and weight measurements at up to five points in time<p>- confounding factors are fully accounted for, rather than hand-waved away. This is a complex model based on random forests and linear model, and the results are entirely cross-validated.<p>Stay tuned for more detailed computations. I will also ask the organizers for the exact definition of breastfeeding used.<p>---<p>Edit:<p>On the other hand, the study is still very appealing because according to the authors, there is little correlation between demographics and breastfeeding in Brazil, whereas the validity of the effect I&#x27;m reporting is dependent on whether the demographic model is powerful enough to remove the correlation. Still, I believe most of the correlation is easy to remove, and it isn&#x27;t clear that there aren&#x27;t subtle demographic effects even in Brazil. In particular, the proportion of participants with missing IQ data seems to decrease with duration of breastfeeding, and I don&#x27;t know if they have an explanation for that.",1426671069
9224380,comment,9223393,9224174,0,0,jwdunne,,,"In some cases, the pressure to breastfeed can do more harm than good. If the parent is feeling stressed, as it can be an extremely intense and also painful experience, the bonding process can suffer. More importantly, some mothers just cannot produce enough milk. The father of my adopted son forced my wife to breastfeed. Over a 3 month period, the poor boy lost a dangerous amount of weight and needed a stay in hospital, where he had strict, formula-based feeding schedule. If my wife was asleep, the nurses wouldn&#x27;t even bother waking her up, they&#x27;d just feed him.<p>The result, and not to say this is a cause but a potential contributing factor, is that this unfortunate boy has major developmental delays, is unable to speak properly and what he can say he often doesn&#x27;t understand. I personally have had my past investigated by social services to ensure I won&#x27;t have a negative impact on his development (I suffered from psychosis in my teenage years, likely due to stress from attention deficit disorder and a traumatic event). Teachers and myself have noticed, for example, he regularly speaks well out of context, which is notably worse than his peers. There&#x27;s a tough road ahead.<p>With articles like this, we are looking at individual, specific factors when the reality is much more complicated and results from an interplay of thousands of microscopic to large and obvious factors. With children and their development, it is just not simple. We are, whether we like it or not, complex systems.<p>Parents of healthy body and mind want the best for their children.

The characters they use to write the name of China or Japan, the ten digits, the characters for year, month, and day in dates, and so many thousands of others in Chinese characters are what they all consider to be the same characters. That is not all characters, but it includes so many that insisting on different code points by language would make a real mess. Hong Kong has many characters that are unique to HK Cantonese. So, should Cantonese have a full set of <i>all</i> Chinese characters that are the &quot;Cantonese characters&quot;? How about Shanghainese, then? Or Hakka? Teochew (Chaozhou) or a dozen Chinese languages? Full, independent sets of all Chinese characters for each?

Now what? You can&#x27;t find your search term? You mess up the database and have two identical-looking keys?<p>No, Han unification is not conceptually different from unifying ABCs used by English and Spanish speakers, Cyrillic used by Russians or Serbs, etc., except that there are many more characters, so the boundary between what should be unified and what shouldn&#x27;t contains more items in the gray zone to cause debate.

I also think the danger of having this attitude is that if we all thought like this nothing would become better. If no one wanted to get out of C++ we wouldn&#x27;t have had many languages.<p>The premise behind Racket, in broad strokes, is to provide a platform and programming language for making new programming languages. The most important identifier/keyword in Racket is &#x27;#lang&#x27; (specified at the top of a file to tell Racket which language the file is in). It&#x27;s a whole ecosystem in which a multitude of languages exist and the only thing they really need to have in common is that on some level they speak Racket.<p>Personally, I think the above paragraph explains how exciting Racket as a language and platform is, but it doesn&#x27;t sound that interesting on the surface. It does allow people to create things like this[0] and this[1], though, which displays real practical use; shaping the way you solve the problem to fit the actual problem.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSmqbnhHp1c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSmqbnhHp1c</a> - Naughty Dog&#x27;s scripting language

However, this is a US Citizen who was held without charge and tortured. My only claim, and its a reasonable one, is that this sort of thing can only be done with the tacit approval of the State Department or the FBI.<p>It is possible that they took an interest in him out of the blue, but he had done nothing suspicious in UAE to warrant such brutality. Suppose he had done something suspicious in Dubai, does it seem likely that any client regime would do this to a US Citizen to ask them &quot;who was the bearded man you met with last Thursday?&quot; The story that he was asked about the mosque in Portland is much more plausible.<p>Sadly, the US exercises enormous influence on small regimes like the one in UAE.",1426669689

  {
     int codepoint = string.codePointAt(i);

Java 8 seems to have acquired a codePoints() method on the CharSequence interface which seems to do the same thing.<p>But this just adds to the fact, proper Unicode string processing is a pain :).",1426669520

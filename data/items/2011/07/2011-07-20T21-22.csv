I'm currently having a play with it and it's funny but I have some suggestions:<p>A firebug inspired element inspector may be a good thing. I think jumping straight to the line of CSS rather than the separate, filtered window would be a great idea. I'd really love that.<p>Another thing, but less important, would be auto-complete. Either that or ways to expand ZenCSS abbreviations. This would push my productivity to the moon.<p>Another thing I was thinking of hacking on to Firebug (when I find out how) is selector hinting. The way this would work is, when you type a selector, the available ones are given to you, much like method hints in IDEs. This would be very useful to me at least. There have been many times when I've needed to know a particular hierarchy/id name/class name and found myself having to reference elsewhere.<p>To host CSS would be a social/pointy-haired-boss issue but I could make necessary recommendations.

2787519,comment,2785195,2786643,1,0,cube13,,,">Terrible advice. Use NIO and do it properly. Creating 1 thread per connection is for unskilled programmers.<p>Depends on the application.  If the connection is handling real-time financial data(for example), there might be enough heavy lifting on the data stream to warrant one thread per connection.  A good programmer wouldn't have too many of these threads running on a given machine, however, because one thread can easily consume a full CPU core, and still need more.<p>For connections that aren't doing much work, it's definitely better to aggregate connections onto a much smaller number of threads to avoid context switches.<p>>In my experience once you get up to about 1k threads in Java you'll be wasting most of the CPU up switching between them.<p>I agree.  Thread context switching is extremely expensive.  I've seen 10 thread applications consume full CPU time with context switches alone.  There are a lot of tricks that can be done to mitigate it, like binding threads to certain CPU cores, making sure that threads that are communicating with each other are on the same CPU to avoid L2/L3 cache thrashing, etc.  It's a lot of work, and requires a lot of knowledge about the code and system, but the results are staggeringly good.  We've seen performance boosts on the order of 25% with single threaded applications, and boosts around 30-40% for multithreaded apps.  Almost all of this is done outside the application code, however.<p>I can't imagine any reason why you'd have 1k threads running on the same box in one process, to be honest.  1k+ threads seems to indicate a lot of threads doing very little work.  If they're doing basically nothing, consuming less than 1% of the CPU each, it's better to try to consolidate the work they're doing into a much smaller number of threads.  It's a lot of work, but will get pretty considerable performance gains.",1311197664

2787440,comment,2786066,2787247,4,0,brianwski,,,"Earlier we were totally interested in ZFS, as it would replace RAID & LVM as well (and ZFS gets great reviews).  But (to my understanding) native ZFS is not available on Linux and we're not really looking to switch to OpenSolaris.<p>ANOTHER option down this line of thinking is switching to btrfs, but we haven't played with it yet.<p>By the way, at Backblaze I've felt like we have had to implement several things that I would have guessed would be standard ""off the shelf"".  One example: When a customer wants to download a restore file with a web browser, are you aware there are no checksums for over-the-network transfers other than the built in (completely unacceptable) 16-bit TCP checksum?  You are virtually guaranteed to have an undetected corruption within 30 Gbytes of download, which is basically what we like to call ""a totally average customer restore"".  So Backblaze had to write our own custom reliable, restartable ""downloader"".  It boggles my mind that the whole internet is throwing undetected errors on HTTP downloads and nobody cares to fix the protocol?!!  Where the heck is Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, or <insert standards body> defining a standard for web browser downloads larger than a few GBytes?",1311196339

The bundle system together with the fact that it has had a large and strong community backing it up for years is a major, major plus. There are existing bundles out there for almost everything, often even for obscure frameworks/languages. For example, if you don't think you'd want commands or snippets to toy around with new languages, think about syntax highlighting.",1311196305

2787435,comment,2785238,2785797,1,0,kelnos,,,"Yeah, I have a 2010 11"" MBA, and I'm thinking about the upgrade.  I really wish they'd bumped the max RAM up to 8GB; Eclipse for Android development is cramped in 4GB with other stuff running.  I'm a little worried about the Intel graphics as well.<p>The upgrade is also a little more expensive, too.  I think I paid $1500 for the maxed-out 11"" last year, but maxing out the new 11"" costs $1650.<p>But the Core i7 and 256GB SSD are <i>very</i> tempting.  I dual-boot OSX and Linux, and 128GB is starting to feel a bit cramped.  I was looking around at aftermarket SSD upgrades for my existing Air, and an off-the-shelf upgrade to 240GB would cost me $520, which is a third of the cost of the laptop!  I could probably sell my current one for $800-$1k, and get the new one for $1650 without breaking the bank.",1311196146

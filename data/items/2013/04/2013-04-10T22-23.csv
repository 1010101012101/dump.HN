But I personally feel this notation gives up way to much in order to try and be easier to learn. (which I still don't think is not a good enough reason to create a new notation since if you are putting the time and effort to learn how to play an instrument I think you are likely ok with taking some time to learn the notation)",1365634767

The discussion about what is evil and not isn't very relevant to someone who just lost their business because some algorithm tripped inside Google and nobody inside Google can help. It would be better if Google committed itself to more concrete promises about how to treat their customers and what not to do, and had independent audits to keep them honest.

5528782,comment,5527810,5528433,1,0,mbell,,,"They mention transactions so I would assume they are using InnoDB in which case you have to have a primary key, if you don't define one InnoDB will either use the first unique not null column it finds or failing that, create one using the internal 6 byte rowID.  They could have used a composite primary key on (project_id, backer_id) but that can create other problems such as blowing up the size of your secondary indexes (primary index is included in all secondary indexes in innoDB).  So I doubt they were too worried about the storage space compared to other options and probably already had a unique ID column for every row.<p>If I had to guess, they wanted this column so they could use it to get the number of the backers on any project very quickly.  InnoDB's COUNT() performance historically is pretty terrible, especially with large tables, I'm guessing they were trying to avoid that, in addition to being able to provide the project owners with a 'backer ID' that is more human digestible.<p>That said, the count could be handled with a trigger and there is a trick using LAST_INSERT_ID(expr) for generating the sequence:<p>Create a column somewhere to hold the sequence value, for example in a backer_sequence_id column in the project table then:<p><pre><code>    UPDATE project SET backer_sequence_id=LAST_INSERT_ID(backer_sequence_id+1) WHERE id = ?;
    SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID();   <----returns the sequence ID that was created
</code></pre>
It does lock the row in the project table if this is inside a larger transaction but that shouldn't be too hard to avoid.  LAST_INSERT_ID is handled per client, so its multi-connection safe.  The above works inside a trigger also so the client code wouldn't need to think about it.",1365634724

The notes are large, bold, and easy to recognize and also easy to write. Memorizing GBDFA, EGBDF, ACEG, and FACE is not that difficult.<p>This new notation has many egregious flaws. Removing the key signature is one of them. Not only does the key signature allow for instant recognition of the pitch and tones used and a general idea of what the piece should sound like, but it also makes writing sheets that much easier for arrangers and composers.<p>Second, who thought it was a good idea to replace the accidental signs with squiggly marks? A huge step down in usability, I'm afraid. Maybe in sevenths and chords with very close note spacing, but unless you're playing Death Waltz, it is not a problem (usually).<p>Also, the Consumer Reports-esque notes are also distracting and don't serve any purpose. If I saw what is an ""E"" on this note, I would play it for 4 beats -- that is, assuming that this is in x/4 time. It's more confusing for longtime music readers than musicians, but it would still throw off many, I'd guess. At any rate, however, if you can't memorize the staff lines and spaces, you aren't a musician. Period.<p>The uselessness of this notation is compounded by the fact that practically no instructor will be willing to give up a notation that has been in use their entire life, and also for centuries.<p>Do I see this being successful? Maybe, in small circles (no pun intended). But the harsh truth is that the current notation is easier to write, easier to read, and more efficient.<p>Case closed.",1365634647

When I start thinking of note names I become much more clumsy and slow, because it's interrupting my spatial thinking. I always recommend that people think about intervals as opposed to note names when learning a piece of music. It encourages various good habits, like being able to identify overarching patterns in the music and play in different keys easily. Intervals also correspond more closely to how your hands have to move. Because of all this I don't think it's helpful in the long run to have the visual reinforcement of each note name. It might be easier for children or beginners at first, but in the end it may be a crutch that prevents the student from ""seeing"" the music..!",1365634520

If for every situation where you would elegantly use recursion you'd end up with real recursion and all its overhead you'd indeed end up overflowing the stack. For a C/C++ etc program it would not matter whether your loop iterator would be 10 or 10,000,000,000, the program would just run a little slower. The rust/clojure program (coded up without knowledge of the underlying mechanisms, so 'naively') would likely run out of memory. With TCO such a naive implementation would run just fine. 10,000,000,000 is merely large, not infinite and should all things otherwise being equal not come with a huge memory penalty if all you're doing is writing elegant code in the most applicable idiom for a certain language.",1365633855

5528639,comment,5528274,5528274,85,0,arnarbi,,,"I'm very skeptical that this is an improvement (but kudos for thinking outside the box). Here's something that was intended as constructive criticism, but maybe ended up more as just criticism:<p>Removing the key signature is <i>not</i> a good idea. When playing in G major, the sharp accidental on the Fs is not put at the beginning of the line just to avoid printing it in the score. Rather, it fits there because when I play in G major, I put my brain in G major mode, in which case it would be distracting to have an accidental on every single F.<p>Similarly, writing a special symbol for each pitch seems it would get heavily in the way of transposing on the fly. The position already encodes the pitch, and the ABCDEFG names kind of get in the way of understanding the melody, which is more about relative intervals than absolute values.<p>And what does the little parenthesis on the length line mean? For half- and whole notes it seems to mean it doubles the length (a quarternote with one or two parentheses), but for sixteenth-notes it seems to indicate that it halves it (an eighth-note with a single parenthesis mark).<p>I also question removing the stem of a note. I have a feeling that is one of the stronger queues for reading rhythm. Spacing is <i>not</i> very important, and indeed especially in dense scores for solo instruments, that need to have few page turns, notes are often just spaced as tightly as possible.<p>The author also recognized that the beams on eighth- and sixtheenth-notes (e.g. in the left hand) are very important rhythmic cues, and replaced them with that horizontal thing with the arrow on the left. This is a bit hard to read though when there are no stems to link them to the note and the pitch interval is big.<p>The part about it being easy to write by hand looks good, and made me feel good at first. Then you realize that hand-written traditional notation is quite different from typeset one, just like handwritten text is very different from printed text. Drawing all the little balls and filling in the halfmoon C, up and down thingies seems tedious, when traditionally one writes a simple dot or a little slash instead of the note head.",1365632906

5528573,comment,5523640,5527158,1,0,Groxx,,,"Nozzles are basically just a more efficient version of this, since they don't waste as much energy which would escape out the sides (it's instead contributing to internal pressure, which pushes everything out the open end more quickly).  Burning rocket fuel expands it rapidly, which is essentially all a bomb does.  The downside to a nozzle is that you have to keep the internal pressure low enough that it doesn't rupture.  This is far less of a problem with an Orion-style ship.<p>Think of an explosion.  They produce moving walls of compressed air that flings stuff around.  Though this is just because it's in <i>air</i>, it's a lot of energy.  The same amount of energy is still being released if you blow it up anywhere else. (ignoring bonus 'free' energy from e.g. burning the air itself)<p>Take the explosion out of air, and you still have a 'shock wave' from the material which made up the bomb, and electrons / photons / whatever else materialized from that much energy being released in a tiny space.  And it's all moving <i>very</i> quickly.<p>When it hits your ship's back-end, it gives it a kick.  Obviously far less than the total energy released (whatever % of the sphere of expanding energy which your ship covers), but still something.  If the explosion is big enough, or close enough, you are still talking an immense 'kick'.  And since you have no relatively-fragile nozzle (just an arbitrarily big, thick wall), the force can be many many times greater than a normal rocket.<p>So to make it survivable, you probably need a big ship and some kind of impact-absorber to take the shock out of it, and / or lots of small bombs that won't kill everyone due to acceleration.  Or just get rid of the squishy humans and crank up the proximity / bomb size to whatever you feel like.",1365632164
5528572,comment,5526684,5528391,7,0,jessriedel,,,"OK, I kind of agree.  I think ""circular logic"" is a very bad term here, because it suggests a mistake in logical reasoning, when in fact you just mean that the Nash equilibrium is only meta stable.  Similarly, ""induction base case"" is bad because it again suggests reasoning, but I think here you recognize that and put it in quotes to show that it's just an analogy (and a neat one at that).<p>But I disagree that you need taxation as a bootstrap to get you to the equilibrium.  Indeed, in the actual history of the US it was the backing by gold that established the dollar; initial taxation was minimal.  Now that backing has been removed, and the dollar still functions.  Then, I infer, you would argue that taxation has replaced gold-backing as the stabilizer.<p>Your penultimate paragraph is an interesting suggestion, but I'm not convinced.  Could you point me toward some place where it was fleshed out? I can easily imagine a world where people keep writing new contracts denominated in dollars, whose street value is set by the process that I described.  Where is the motivation for people to defect?  One answer is that a new currency (like Bitcoin) comes along that has special properties that make it useful enough for people to absorb transaction costs and to start exchanging alongside the original fiat currency.  Then things could unravel.  And indeed, taxation could suppress this by providing additional friction like I mentioned in my original comment.  But in the absence of such a new currency I don't expect the dollar to spontaneously start to unravel on its own simply because there are no taxes. People would continue to need a medium of exchange and the dollar is very good.",1365632159

And I suspect we'll see some systems emerging in the coming months that are better suited for transactions, with immediate verification, etc.  It could be that Bitcoin's long-term role in the crypto currency ecosystem  is as a store of value, with transfers only occurring when someone needs to deposit money into their version of a digital checking account, or else large transactions that are not extremely time sensitive, like buying a house or car.",1365631698

Indie developers are .much. more opinionated than AAA developers can afford to be, so when Microsoft shits on indie developers (XBLIG), they aren't hesitant to just develop for a different platform.<p>Compare this to Bungie (or is it 343?) who develops one of Xbox's major exclusive titles - Halo. Microsoft can make development as hard as their incompetence can offer for Bungie's developers, but in the long run the developer's opinions don't matter because management calls the shots and as long as Microsoft pays them enough to maintain Halo as an exclusive title, they don't really care.<p>Hobbyist/indie developers don't get in on any of those perks, and since they make their own decisions, they can choose to develop for whichever platform they please.

A warrant must specify the place to be searched and the things being sought. It can be used to compel the disclosure of the same information as an ECPA subpoena or court orderbut also a user's search query information and private content stored in a Google Account, such as Gmail messages, documents, photos and YouTube videos.

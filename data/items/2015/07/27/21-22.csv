9958298,comment,9958156,9958250,0,0,versuslabs,,,"Hi! One of my first real apps I ever developed for Android (back in 2011) was an online trivia game very similar to the trivia games you see nowadays (asynchronous gameplay, 4 options per questions, 5 questions per turn, etc).<p>When I look back to it, it was very weak at the technical level. I developed the Android client and the API while learning stuff at the same time. So, 4 years go by, and I decided to have another shot at it. So, in a sense, you&#x27;re right, it did start off as a personal challenge to see just how much different the end product would be, given that I&#x27;ve now been working full time on Android for the past 4 years.<p>But other than that, it&#x27;s actually quite different than QuizUp since this game is real-time and seems to have steered heavily away from what a normal trivia game is like. With their latest releases, they&#x27;ve sort of created a sort of massive social network around the questions/answers genre.<p>I wanted to make an app that went back to the basics. Something you can use here and there while killing time..open the app, have fun answering a few questions, and done.",1438034355

Huge enterprise market competitors aren&#x27;t a problem as long as you aren&#x27;t competing against them. Often times the large enterprise market competitor has a gap in their software solution that a small company can capitalize on filling. For example, maybe the industry uses a huge enterprise inventory tracking system but that system doesn&#x27;t have a good mobile reporting solution. A small company could make tens of millions of dollars on a mobile reporting solution specifically for the large enterprise inventory tracking system.<p>If I were in your company I would be looking at WHY customers are currently buying your product and then work on capitalizing on that. If there really is no market left (which I doubt, honestly), then look for a gap that your competitors have which you can fill.",1438034307

The real question is why the bloat and awful code and algorithms? I&#x27;ll add to my previous reply to that question, with an idea that occurred to me last night: one answer to prisoner&#x27;s dilemmas/tragedies of the commons is to appoint a supervisor whose word is law, say when programs are running...<p>And what do you know, we already have one - called an OS. Someday, I expect that OSes will be smart enough to examine the executables they have been given (note that that can be done in parallel) and reward tight code with more cycles, and punish sloppy code with lower priority (unless the user says otherwise, which she may.) Our A.I. might well be good enough now, for that - to do at least crude reverse engineering or pattern recognition rapidly (doesn&#x27;t have to be real time, of course.) This solves the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma (which is also a freeloading problem) by punishing the freeloaders and rewarding the cooperators; now good code isn&#x27;t slowed down just as if it too were bad code; and most companies are forced to start tightening things up, and to actually compete with each other to produce better code than most other outfits. (For webpages - either the browser or OS could police webpages after examining the code and load of pages.)<p>I do believe that&#x27;s a patentable idea. Or two.

9958254,comment,9949818,9955820,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"You make decent points but are missing the bigger picture: vast majority of problems with security, esp code injection, are caused by mechanisms or design patterns that create insecurity by default. It takes insane amounts of effort to use the basic, building blocks on complex applications without creating problems. The building blocks themselves are often simple or can be made that way. That you say the robust methods only work on the simplest stuff is actually an endorsement of my approach if we focus them on building blocks. That&#x27;s what I mainly push it for so let&#x27;s test my theory with a real-world example.<p>We&#x27;ll only use techniques from production systems made before the 80&#x27;s, that were commercially successful, and that exist today in some form. Should make it easy to argue practicality. Gives us Burroughs B5500 (1963) and IBM System/38 (1979). Pointers are tagged for protection, actual value inaccessible by apps, and created by program loader only. Memory is tagged as code or data during load time with all input from I/O tagged as data by default by hardware. Any input can&#x27;t be executed unless administrator explicitly allows it and it&#x27;s actually the compiler that does that anyway since apps come as source in type-safe, HLL in Burroughs model. Interfaces are checked during compilation, too. Processor checks these on every instruction. Also does bounds checking, overflow checking, type-checking of function call arguments, and stack protection. Checks and processor run in parallel for performance with final state not written unless check passes. So, you can&#x27;t smash pointers, arrays, buffers, stacks, or individual data with overflow: all just generates exceptions which are recovered from or freeze app with admin notification.<p>So, you want to hijack the app via a corrupted PDF or network packet. Assume, as you said, that the simple mechanisms above were implemented at EAL6-7 and apps just used them. Where would you start with a <i>software attack</i> (no rowhammer lol) with input to an app if you only got exceptions when hitting pointers, data fields, memory management, stacks, and arrays/buffers? What&#x27;s left? If you&#x27;re claim is true, then these simple modifications provide no meaningful increase to the reliability or security of our systems. There&#x27;s other security risks but I&#x27;m focusing on code injection via attacking software with input. I predict attacker&#x27;s job is so difficult in this model that most would go for social engineering or sabotaging executables to attack compiler/installer/loader. Those are also protected by these mechanisms and ruggedly built (eg Ada or SPARK w/ all checks on). You&#x27;re actually more knowledgeable and skilled than me at the many implementation attack methods. How many are left at this point? Seriously, so I can counter them too.<p>Funny you mentioned hardware. It certainly does have errata here and there. Yet, that&#x27;s despite tens of millions to billions of transistors running concurrently. Its error rate is actually incredible. I wonder why. Let&#x27;s look at design flow for Intel, IBM, etc.: specs to RTL to gates with equivalence checking at each layer; lots of testing; formal verification (Intel) and falsification (IBM) of stuff at various layers; synthesis tools with validation approaches to that; generic components with interfaces and timing analysis; gate-level testing to see where tools were lying; comparisons of instrumented chip to the models after a fab run. The difficulties were overcome by constantly investing in tools for various problems and heuristics that made them work better. Guess what? Those methods look very similar to the B3, A1, EAL6, and other assurance activities. They also <i>worked</i>: quality in terms of errata varied from staying steady to improving over time despite exponential increases in complexity.<p>Believe it or not, you don&#x27;t need to verify a whole system at highest levels. I&#x27;m not even promising absolute security from the effort: just saying systems designed this way have had incredible resilience to pentests, faults, and external attacks. I say invest the effort into mechanisms like above, languages immune to what we can, analysis tools catching what we can, compilers, most-used parts of kernels, interfaces (esp glue), parsers, and so on. These have already been built rather than theory: really just re-applying existing work to new system. Less than 1% of code and design done right knocks out 99% of routes for code-injection and many other issues in the rest of the system. The rest we catch with security research and reviews. Or recover from after monitoring detects problems.<p>So, Thomas, would you trust an x86-style processor with a monolithic kernel coded in C? Or a system like EROS running on my above CPU that only uses safe mechanisms (hardware-enforced), safe languages, and robust tools for making one properly use the other? Even if COTS-style implementation, the amount of vulnerabilities and their severity should nose dive. Your current position is that 400 kernel and thousands of user-level vulnerabilities resulting in malware execution are better than thousands of user-mode exceptions, a few kernel-exceptions, and maybe a few injects from what we didn&#x27;t see coming. I disagree and think we can do better. Friggin 1960&#x27;s-1970&#x27;s tech had better security & reliability than current architectures! Academics (see crash-safe.org or CHERI) have with way less time and money than Intel, IBM, etc. So, why do you speculate? Methods that got results against problems before will get results against same kinds of problems again. Just need to <i>apply them</i> and in most cost-effective way. All I preach.",1438033882

It measures productivity in terms of actual monetary value per worker and then compares it to the number of hours worked.<p>> The effect of automation is very hard to quantify because it tends to displace low-skilled jobs that don&#x27;t pay much in the first place. But the social impact of this is huge -- you take the people at the bottom of the economy and take away the only jobs that were accessible to them. Social unrest is inevitable. This will likely impact the economy in negative ways in years to come, and we need to understand this.<p>Again, addressed by the article.

Rent is 2/3 of my total expenses, and 1/2 of my rent is only because of the city I live in, if I chose a cheaper city or lived 15 minutes further away, I could have the same house for 1/2 the rent. Of the remaining 1/3 expenses, many of those are cost-of-living related as well.<p>Location is something that&#x27;s never really going to get cheaper, because location is fundamentally scarce. You can have as many cities as you want, but you can only have 1 SF, 1 Boston, etc. I don&#x27;t want to live in <i>a city</i>, I want to live in Boston. And that&#x27;s expensive compared to other cities around the world.<p>I think this is a testament to how cheap technology has made our lives. 100 years ago, things like clothes and food were a much more significant part of lifetime expenses. And as technology continues to improve, location is going to continue to eat up a larger portion of total expenses.",1438032471

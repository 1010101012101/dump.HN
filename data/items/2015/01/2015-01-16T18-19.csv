I don&#x27;t think HN is a mature enough forum for this discussion. Its just a reddit-like upvote/downvote gamificiation machine at this point.<p>I find it amusing that American culture dictates that once you become 18 you are now sexualized and free to partake of whatever media you like, but an hour before your birthday you are an asexual being with no interest in things other than what the political correct types dictate.<p>A lot of this stuff is aimed for the 14-18 group where puberty kicks in. Yes, there are boobs and bulging crotches! The characters sometimes have sex! I know, its crazy!  It almost reflects the hormonal madness of puberty.<p>The problem is American culture is so damn puritanical that not only have we dismissed this kind of art as victimizing, if not illegal, that we pretend that the status quo of this level of censorship is fine.  Puberty will find a way. Kids will date, fuck, get high, etc.  Why our art needs to reflect some kind of Judeo-Christian 1950s ideal is beyond me.  Heaven forbid kids that age are represented as how they truly are or art they want is aimed at them.  Or that, heaven forbid to SJW types, that most people don&#x27;t have a problem with traditional gender roles.  A manga about a girl trying to get a boyfriend shouldn&#x27;t cause a social catastrophe.  Its fine.<p>I think this kind of thing is a legitimate social panic, the same way people were obsessed with Satanism in the 1980s. We&#x27;re going to look back at these ultra-politically correct attitudes today and wonder why we were so worried about displaying traditional roles, sexuality, and violence in fiction.",1421434583

The top slot by far belongs to the depletion problem. There is a finite amount of the stuff that is economically recoverable. We don&#x27;t know exactly where the limit is, but when we hit it -- assuming we have no alternatives -- we will begin a downward spiral toward the collapse of modern civilization. This might also involve global warfare, possibly nuclear, and a &quot;mass die off&quot; of the human species. At the very least all economic growth would cease and with it all opportunity for anyone to advance their condition in life. The pie would begin shrinking, and this would bring a return to a scarcity mentality in all things. An &quot;orderly die-back and return to bare subsistence&quot; is probably the <i>best</i> case scenario.<p>The fact that our entire modern technological society is <i>absolutely</i> dependent upon a finite source of energy is probably the greatest existential threat that we face. That this isn&#x27;t talked about more is likely a result of denial in the face of a very terrifying problem. A good way to think about it is to compare it to a planet-killer asteroid that we know is headed our way.<p>Next up is probably the geopolitical nightmare of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels transfer massive quantities of wealth from (relatively) liberal open societies to brutal totalitarian states where people are beheaded for questioning the dominant religion or dictator. It finances both terrorism and the ideologies behind it. The only alternative way to still get these fuels would be to embark upon a blood-soaked imperial crusade to simply seize these fossil fuel reserves, an alternative that&#x27;s arguably worse than the existing state of affairs for many reasons.<p>I&#x27;d put the CO2 problem in the third slot below these. The fourth slot would probably belong to the <i>other</i> environmental damages inflicted by fossil fuel mining and use including air and water pollution and the destruction of otherwise valuable land.<p>Anyone who argues for the fossil fuel status quo at this point is delusional or insane.

This journalist, Matt O&#x27;Brien, clearly has done little research on Bitcoin and is not familiar with mining operations. His article contains lies, fallacies, and personal opinions that do not reflect reality.<p><i>&quot;What are [venture capitalists] supposed to say, though, when they&#x27;ve bet hundreds of millions of dollars on it?&quot;</i><p>Fallacy number one. If VCs were merely praising Bitcoin with no (or very few) investments, the journalist would say &quot;well why don&#x27;t they put their money where their mouths are?&quot;. Now they do put their money on it, but he says &quot;well what else are they supposed to say?&quot;.<p><i>&quot;It&#x27;s fallen 36 percent the past two days, as you can see below, with a 24 percent decline the past 24 hours.&quot;</i><p>This is hardly newsworthy. What he seems to forget or point out is that Bitcoin is and has always been volatile --no one denies it. There has been <i>dozens</i> of instances where BTC lost (or gained) 20% or more in a span of 24 hours. Today&#x27;s drop is no different than the other ones.<p><i>&quot;It&#x27;s too bad Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t have a central bank to help stabilize its value.&quot;</i><p>This is very ironic to write 2 days after the Swiss central bank themselves caused an appreciation of the CHF of 30% in mere hours, hurting Swiss exports badly.<p><i>&quot;It has no inherent value&quot;</i><p>Another journalist who fails to realize no fiat currency has any inherent value either. Currencies (whether fiat or crypto) have value because people demand/accept them (whether it is the IRS asking to pay your taxes in dollars or Newegg accepting Bitcoin). This is it. Nothing gives them &quot;inherent&quot; value.<p><i>&quot;almost nobody uses it to buy anything other than drugs&quot;</i><p>Utterly false. The journalist has no data, no source, nothing to back up this claim. This claim used to be made 4 years ago when Bitcoin was barely starting to get in the public eye, when the top exchange (MtGox) barely had a few thousand users, when there was no payment processors to help businesses accept Bitcoin, etc. But the reality is that the Bitcoin economy has grown very quickly over the last 4 years: today 82,000 merchants accept Bitcoin [1], numerous processors exist (Bitpay, Coinbase, etc), merchants like Newegg and Gyft experienced their best Bitcoin Black Friday sales ever [2], etc.<p><i>&quot;Bitcoin prices are so low, you see, that miners are spending more money running their supercomputers than they&#x27;re making from new coins.&quot;</i><p>This is not true at all. There is <i>zero</i> reason for a miner to, say, spend $50,000 on electricity a month to mine X bitcoins when he could simply buy these bitcoins from the market for, say, $25,000. So if this was the case, it would make sense financially and logically for the miner to stop mining and buy the coins from the market. At the very least they would suspend mining activities. In fact this is precisely what happened to CEX.io [3] (they were likely inefficient and overspent in some areas, compared to other miners who continue operating because they are still profitable).<p>Nowadays any large smart professional miner does not have high fixed recurring monthly costs like colocation in a data center (these are very cost-ineffective facilities to run mining operations). Instead they set up shop somewhere, eg. in a warehouse retrofitted for cooling and power, see [4]. This makes electricity their highest recurring cost, so they <i>can</i> in theory stop mining any time and it would significantly reduce their operating cost on the spot.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.coindesk.com/state-bitcoin-2015-ecosystem-grows-despite-price-decline/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coindesk.com/state-bitcoin-2015-ecosystem-grows-d...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://blog.bitpay.com/2014/12/09/bitcoin-black-friday-2014-recap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.bitpay.com/2014/12/09/bitcoin-black-friday-2014-...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.coindesk.com/cex-io-halts-cloud-mining-service-due-low-bitcoin-price/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coindesk.com/cex-io-halts-cloud-mining-service-du...</a><p>[4] This is KncMiner&#x27;s facility: <a href=""http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/sites/default/files/KnCMiner-Boden.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/sites/default/files/KnCMin...</a>",1421433534

8900653,comment,8897835,8897835,0,0,jjcm,,,"Krita is great for what it is, but saying &#x27;Goodbye Photoshop, hello Krita&#x27; is akin to saying &#x27;Goodbye tractor, hello vespa&#x27;. If all you&#x27;re doing is trying to get from A to B, a vespa certainly may be a better option, but don&#x27;t think that a vespa can do what a tractor can do.<p>Even GIMP is far behind what Photoshop can provide. Want a really good look at what the differences are between the two? Look at GIMP&#x27;s development roadmap: <a href=""http://wiki.gimp.org/index.php/Roadmap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.gimp.org/index.php/Roadmap</a><p>It&#x27;s usually a pretty quick view of the delta between the two programs. Krita is missing most if not all of these too. Some of the big features Krita and Gimp are missing:<p>1.) Non-destructive editing capabilities. Krita and GIMP have masks, which is a start, but neither support smart objects (dynamically sized/edited objects that don&#x27;t destroy/replace pixel data on resize) or adjustment layers. This is huge. Unless you&#x27;re a painter, no one in the industry uses destructive editing techniques.<p>2.) High bit depth. This is another big one. Since most of the crowd on HN are more familiar with code than design, I&#x27;ll put it in code terms: pretend that you had to do precision work, but a Math.floor() function was called every time you did any arithmetic. When you&#x27;re doing light adjustments/corrections, blending, color correction, and such, the work can introduce heavy banding when you&#x27;re working in 8bits per channel. By switching to 16bits per channel you provide way more fidelity on the individual pixel level, eliminating a lot of banding in your final product. Even if you have a monitor that can only display 8bit color, working in 16 can change your end result drastically.<p>There are some minor features too that bug me. The inability to add a mask to layer groups is a big one for me. Layer effects (while often overused and gaudy) can be really helpful for design work - need to change the color of an icon that&#x27;s raster art? Just drop a color overlay on it. If you have style swatches, it can be really easy to do fast mockups using this. This in conjunction with Layer Comps (also something missing in Gimp right now) can really help in switching between two or more alts.<p>These programs are a long way off from being Photoshop. Whenever I see a story like this where Photoshop is replaced by GIMP/Krita, what I see isn&#x27;t that these things have the capability to replace Photoshop, but rather that the people who replaced it were only using a tiny subset of Photoshop&#x27;s capabilities, and found something more suited to their usecase.",1421433044

8900626,comment,8900393,8900467,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"While I agree about the speculators, they are not the reason BTC is hard to use as a currency. Rather, BTC is the reason BTC is hard to use as a currency. Let&#x27;s see here:<p>- BTC tends to fluctuate a lot. I could buy a pizza with it today, or a car tomorrow, or a house in a week. Therefore, I am going to think twice about buying a pizza today.<p>- Tax implications of BTC are complicated. If you have never owned BTC, and this year decide to buy it to experiment with it, now you have additional paperwork to file about it. If you buy it via a BTC ATM, or some other cash method, you now have to keep track of all the records. (Presumably, places like Coinbase, etc. do this for you, I haven&#x27;t checked). This is not insurmountable, but that&#x27;s different than taking $20 out of an ATM and buying a slice of pizza.<p>- BTC is hard to acquire. Yes, yes it is. Coinbase requires a multi-day verification process.<p>- BTC is hard to keep secure. To do this properly, you have to know how to create an encrypted cold storage wallet <i>and</i> how to keep your computer safe so that when you unlock it, someone doesn&#x27;t grab the wallet while you are using it. This is <i>hard</i>. It&#x27;s so hard that intelligent people with domain knowledge get it wrong. I don&#x27;t expect someone who is not a &quot;computer person&quot; to just get it. Coinbase and such are great for the &quot;not computer persons&quot;, but are not secure (as in, you need to use 2 factor auth + strong password, which most people do not do; it&#x27;s also not secure in that if someone does get into your account, you are done for. There is no reversal/insurance).<p>- BTC is weird when you are spending money. With fiat currency, I go on Amazon, punch in my credit card number, hit &quot;buy&quot; and viola! my order is all set. Theoretically, my credit card can get rejected later, but in practice it doesn&#x27;t happen; if it does, I am familiar with the process. With BTC, I am suddenly shown number of confirmations, have to wait for minutes to know if my order went through, etc. Imagine buying Google IO tickets with BTC: by the time my confirmation comes through, someone else already paid with a faster method and got my reservation. (I know they recently changed it to a queue/invitation system, but my point stands for lots of purchases where the quantity is limited).<p>- BTC is weird to spend, again. If my BTC is in an encrypted cold storage wallet, as it should be, I now have to defrost it, decrypt it, push the BTC somewhere, then wait. Oh, and for some modes of spending, I then have to transfer BTC again, and wait again (localcoin for example).<p>So, where will BTC go from here? Well, I think it&#x27;ll continue being a specialized currency. It&#x27;s not great for buying pizza, and I don&#x27;t think ever will be. It is great for transferring money in/out of restricted jurisdictions, or from person to person without leaving an obvious trail. That part works well. If you are a Snowden-type whistleblower and need your friend to get you money, this is as good a way to do it as any. Or if you are my grandfather who cannot get his money out of Ukraine due to the banks &quot;not having enough USD on hand&quot; to wire his balance to a US bank. Or if you want to make an anonymous donation. BTC is basically a faster and more secure version of stuffing cash into envelopes and mailing it.",1421432861

Install quad copters on the barge which launch once the barge detects the landing stage is inbound, have them position themselves using the GPS from the barge 100 yards out in four directions. Then have four reference lights on the corners of the barge (can be LEDs) to give you the ability to back compute angles from the video.

Certainly, bitcoin trade volume will be a very important part of this equation, if it does not really take off as an actual currency, but remain as instrument to store wealth, that could spell disaster for bit coin.<p>If miners do turn away from bitcoin, the capacity will be drastically reduce which makes a 51% attack much more feasible, threatening bitcoin&#x27;s existence. This is much more worrisome than transaction speed slow-down and in fact, as long as there is heavy volume, miners could make money off transaction fees so they are almost mutually exclusive events.<p>Despite all this, I think bitcoin is pioneering the field, and regardless of it lives or dies, it will have impacts in various facets of the future.",1421432586

Speculation has determined the price for the last 2+ years and will continue to do so into the foreseeable future.  The problem is that the value of bitcoin is not fundamentally tied to anything except the cost of maintaining the network, and it&#x27;s clear at this point that hashpower responds to speculation, not the other way around.  I&#x27;m curious to see how some of the new cryptos perform, like Nubits and Bitshares, which have a split between the crypto commodity, subject to wild fluctuations in price, and a crypto currency which is pegged to e.g. the dollar, at least in theory.  The problem is, as usual, the network effect with bitcoin - nothing is likely to supplant it without some big real-world demand.  If it can&#x27;t find any real use case other than black market transactions, we can easily count on another 33 deaths ahead.<p>[0] <a href=""http://bitcoinobituaries.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitcoinobituaries.com/</a>",1421432390

8900491,comment,8898382,8900371,0,0,mraleph,,,"V8 <i>can</i> inline at bimorphic (trimorphic and quadmorphic :)) site. That&#x27;s explicitly stated in the post: see the part about decision tree building. When you inline at polymorphic site in the worst case you have branching flow graph that decides which particular operation to pick. Rewriting example from the post into Java terminology yields:<p><pre><code>    if (o.getClass() == A.class) {
      // inlined variant that matches A
    } else if (o.getClass() == B.class) {
      // inlined variant that matches B
    } else if (o.getClass() == C.class) {
      // inlined varint that matches C
    } else {
      $Deoptimize(); // -> exit, this never returns.
    }
</code></pre>
[Note: `$GetShape(o)` became `o.getClass()`]<p>V8 can do this. If inlined variants for A, B and C are all the same V8 can also do<p><pre><code>    // Check that we are either A, B, C
    if (o.getClass() != A.class &&
        o.getClass() != B.class &&
        o.getClass() != C.class) {
      $Deoptimize();  // -> exit, this never returns
    }
    /* inlined variant for A, B, C */
</code></pre>
However in both cases you <i>pay</i> penalty for the conditional control flow and in the first case V8 is unable to merge subsequent decision trees in any way to eliminate redundancy between them so `o.x + o.y` might end up compiled into something like (assuming polymorphic code that uses objects of shapes {x, y} and {y, x}):<p><pre><code>    int o_x;
    if (o.getClass() == A.class) {
      o_x = $LoadByOffset(o, 12);
    } else if (o.getClass() == B.class) {
      o_x = $LoadByOffset(o, 16);
    } else {
      $Deoptimize(); // -> exit, this never returns.
    }
    int o_y;
    if (o.getClass() == A.class) {
      o_y = $LoadByOffset(o, 16);
    } else if (o.getClass() == B.class) {
      o_y = $LoadByOffset(o, 12);
    } else {
      $Deoptimize(); // -> exit, this never returns.
    }
    o_x + o_y
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s a lot of repetitive branching right here. Arguably the code quality can be substantially improved by merging ifs like this:<p><pre><code>    int o_x, o_y;
    if (o.getClass() == A.class) {
      o_x = $LoadByOffset(o, 12);
      o_y = $LoadByOffset(o, 16);
    } else if (o.getClass() == B.class) {
      o_x = $LoadByOffset(o, 16);
      o_y = $LoadByOffset(o, 12);
    } else {
      $Deoptimize(); // -> exit, this never returns.
    }
    o_x + o_y
</code></pre>
but at the moment V8 does not do this hence the penalty is higher.",1421431928

You could do that with an even bigger pile of shell scripts, of course, and some Linux distros towards the end of the sysvinit era have been trying to. But at some point a giant tangle of shell scripts which are full of copy/paste boilerplate and frequent bugs starts to look like not the best solution.<p>It&#x27;s not like systemd is the first system to come to that conclusion, either. Solaris dropped sysvinit 10 years ago, and OSX dropped its BSD-ish init in the same year. Earlier than that, djb also wrote an init replacement called daemontools, which was a bit of a step in that direction, though a smaller one. That got some uptake but was hampered by some of the oddities of being djbware (e.g. for years it was &quot;license-free software&quot;, and it was only intermittently maintained).",1421431818

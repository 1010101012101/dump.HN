High School has become the babysitters for a group of Americans that are neither children or adults.  We treat them as whichever one is convenient (prosecute as adults, rights as children).  I really believe it does no good to ""fix"" college if the input is broken.<p>It is a shame the area is locked from most innovation due to lack of funding for anybody but the rich.  It would be interesting to try so real alternatives to the current High School system.",1283716672

If you have strong authentication (say, using 2048-bit ssh certificates), it's probably not worth paying those costs.

Capitalism is, perhaps, best thought of as a description of how the world works, in particular, how wealth is created.  It has nothing to say about why wealth is created any more than evolution has something to say about our purpose for being here.  Attributing purposes to properties of the universe is the domain of religion.  Thus, I think it would be safe to say that everybody is a capitalist; some are also beggars or thieves.

I did actually have a really fast lens, but in fact it was the camera that mattered in this situation: most cameras max out around 1/2000 these days. 1/8000 is crazy fast.<p>On most camera systems, the shutter is on the camera and you modify the aperture (size of the hole!) on the lens. The reason Hasselblads are pricey is because 90% of the mechanical parts are in the lens; the body is really just a film holder.<p>Anyhow, two bits of advice/wisdom: first off, once you jump into SLR world and start your learning curve — and you should, it's a lot of fun! — don't be put off by the apparently complexity. I wish I'd understood early on that most of the terms and acronyms are just intentionally confusing stuff designed to keep ""serious"" photography in the realm of the elite. You'll notice that there are millions of beginners and a good number of ""experts"" but very few folks calling themselves intermediate photographers. That's because there's loads of info for getting started, but mysteriously nothing to help people really get past the first steps into Neo territory.<p>So yeah, don't spend a lot of time trying to memorize charts. With practice, you'll internalize it in a way that you can make pretty good judgement calls on exposure.<p>The second thing is that it all gets a lot easier when you figure out that artistically, aperture and shutter speed yield different end results. 95% of the time you should be shooting in aperture priority.<p>The reason for this is simple: shutter speed just decides how bright your shot will be, while aperture allows you to decide on the actual composition of your shot. Once you focus on an object, with aperture priority you get to decide how much of the shot is in focus. Many times the reason to use a low aperture is to blur out the rest of the image (""bokeh""). You rely on the camera to figure out the right exposure for the image you're looking for.<p>At the end of the day, it'd be really weird to make an artistic decision based on exposure speed. That means you'd have to adjust your aperture to suit a speed, which means you give up control of how much is in focus. The only time I can think you'd really want to do this is shooting waterfalls, propellers or on extremely bright days.<p>Can I strongly recommend that you pick up a Panasonic GF-1 and the 20mm pancake lens? It's an amazing gateway drug camera, before you plunge into getting SLRs.<p><a href=""http://craigmod.disqus.com/gf1_field_test_mdash_16_days_in_the_himalayas/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://craigmod.disqus.com/gf1_field_test_mdash_16_days_in_t...</a>",1283714271

Don't waste more than a week fretting over this issue. Even a week is too much! During development you can still consider this issue so it's not an either-or thing. You're still developing in rails and can easily move your system to a standalone server. You're just delaying the cost of hiring a system admin or training one while you spend your valuable time in creating a working system which is very valuable in terms of figuring out the design of it.",1283713429

1664959,comment,1660297,1660854,0,0,phintjens,,,"JMS does cover some of the same ground, all messaging does.  But it's basically an API wrapper around two ancient technologies, a queue system and a topic system.  I think it might have been IBM MQSeries (which became WebSphere MQ) and some other product but can't find the details.<p>What JMS achieved was to somehow turn these two very different semantics into a single one, based around ""destinations"".  That was very clever but also makes JMS weirdly complex to use because the queue (request-reply) pattern and the topic (publish-subscribe) pattern just don't work the same way.  We designed AMQP originally by taking the JMS spec and reverse engineering that into a wire level protocol.  Then around version 0.3 we threw out destinations and came up with a generic wiring model based on exchanges, bindings, queues.  That was my summer holiday in 2005.<p>AMQP is BTW still some way away from a 1.0 standard and mainly it's been five years trying to get reliability working in the center of the network.  That always seemed destined to failure, as I explained in a presentation to the working group in 2006: <a href=""http://www.zeromq.org/whitepapers:switch-or-broker"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zeromq.org/whitepapers:switch-or-broker</a>.<p>AMQP and JMS both focus on resources held in the center of the network.  It's familiar to anyone using HTTP as their stack.  Thin stupid clients talking to big smart servers.  0MQ turns the focus to smart clients working across a thin, stupid (but massive) network.<p>Both approaches have their value.  We (iMatix and the 0MQ community) tend to believe we can do a lot more, faster and more cheaply, using the distributed approach.",1283713399

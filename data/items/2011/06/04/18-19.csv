Therein lies the problem.<p>Most economists will trumpet the increase in societal or collective well-being but will not give you a straight answer about who accrues the gains, who accrues the losses, and what amends -- if any -- should be made towards the economic losers to encourage them to support the proposed schemes. When asked about these matters, most economists claim that these are outside their science. They are then surprised that their science is less than relevant and that people refuse to go along with their plans.<p>EDIT: If you disagree with my assessment please explain your reasons instead of downvoting.<p>EDIT: Added the second paragraph for clarification.",1307213989

2620053,story,,,13,7,bgg,"Ask HN: pros and cons of running multiple startups (webapps) under one LLC?",,"You'd think this is something that has been discussed on HN or another startup forum, but I can't seem to find a combination of search keywords that yields anything useful on the topic.<p>I've been a moonlighting entrepreneur for about 18 months, and have a single, slightly profitable webapp/startup. I am a solo founder and the only contributor/employee. The company is a registered LLC.<p>Since that app requires little ongoing maintenance, I've decided to branch out and create additional, unrelated businesses/apps. I am thinking that it would be best to create a single ""parent"" LLC that owns and operates these various ""brands"" possibly under a DBA.<p>The advantages, as I see it:<p>* The simplicity of running one LLC, having one bank account, etc. instead of 3 to 5.\n* Economy of scale from things like shared hosting, shared payment gateways, shared legal and accounting support, etc.\n* Avoiding additional (admittedly minor) fees from multiple filings.\n* Fewer qualms about things like cross-promotion between the sites.<p>I understand that some of the drawbacks under this scenario are:<p>* The ""limited liability"" umbrella would extend across all the businesses, so that if Brand A gets sued, Brand B's assets are at risk. I can live with that risk (although if there were an easy way around that I'd certainly take it).  I guess maybe a Series LLC would work around that problem? They don't have those in my state but they do in Delaware, of course.<p>* It may be more difficult or complicated to sell one of the businesses.  I hope that can be mitigated by proper accounting, but I don't know that for sure or exactly how difficult that is in practice. For example, would it require independent bank accounts or is it sufficient to maintain independent general ledgers in my accounting?<p>In case it matters, I expect that most of these businesses will be a one-man shop with the occasional contractor but probably not actual employees. I also expect to run the businesses for profit rather than seeking to sell or flip for profit. But I'm not ruling anything out.<p>Am I missing something that makes this a terrible idea?",1307211290

Can someone explain to me what the advantage of running on the JVM is compared to something else (including native code generation)? From what I understand it provides: native tuned GC, stable and tuned JIT, and a class/module mechanism revolving around reusable code libraries (e.g., you could drop in a library written 6 years ago and have it 'just work,' when with C everything needs constantly shifting header files). I haven't used the JVM seriously in years, but I always got the feeling that around these core strengths were layers and layers of bureaucracy -- XML 'makefiles,' a stack-based VM that must inefficiently be translated to a register machine, and the feeling that everything is overengineered to the point that a simple ""hello world"" takes up gargantuan amounts of time and resources compares to things like Chicken Scheme or Go which have roughly the same features.

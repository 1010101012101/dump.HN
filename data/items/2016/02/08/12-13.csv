Citizens should be vigilant, as always, and should consider participating in this process in the future. SaveTheInternet opposes any form of licensing of Internet Services. This includes VoIP.<p>So even though discriminatory <i>pricing</i> is not allowed, operators can still slow/speed down/up apps and websites.

11057677,comment,11054527,11056937,0,0,timr,,,"SF has laws around how much you can raise rents on tenants of older buildings. New construction is not regulated. People debate this endlessly, but what I was referring to was the (nearly universal) practice of raising rents at the end of every lease period, regardless of your tenant history -- for example, a corporate landlord will use a month-to-month lease as an excuse to raise your rent many times a year, regardless of your history or market conditions. They&#x27;re betting that you <i>really</i> don&#x27;t want to move, and that you&#x27;ll suffer a series of regular rent increases, even if you could easily get a better deal elsewhere. This is shitty, evil behavior, but large landlords do it because they can make the bet profitably, in aggregate.<p>That said, it&#x27;s interesting that you asked, because I lived in Colorado for years and the corporatization (and corresponding market behavior) of apartment managers there was as bad as any place I&#x27;ve been. If you stayed in the same complex for a few leases and weren&#x27;t an aggressive negotiator, it was easy to end up paying more per month than someone who had moved in the week before. You had to move every year or two to keep your rent from skyrocketing.<p>It&#x27;s one of the tangible reasons I prefer thoughtful systems of rent regulations (like SF&#x27;s) -- it leads to more stable communities.

Most of the kernel features for containers and the initial release of LXC were done on IBM&#x27;s dime. The two major developers (one focused on kernelspace, one on userspace) then left, at least one of them for Ubuntu, I believe. I know this because I was in touch with them and using LXC personally about 2009-2010 before the docker hype era.<p>As I comprehend it, the features were originally intended to allow fat mainframes to dole out tiny resource portions for distinct jobs. As it seems to have turned out, every CPU these days is the equivalent of a fat mainframe, and the greater challenge is around integrating this form of rapid SOA micro-provisioning in to developer workflow through tooling and education. I just upgraded this few year old Macbook Pro to run Docker 1.1.0: 200MB Linux ISO + Virtualbox + kludgey go wrapper = better solution than IBM ever provided. With a different management culture, they could have released this in 2010, pre-empting stable docker by 5+ years with a kernel commit history and adequate marketing funding.",1454933386

10451421,comment,10449357,10450246,0,0,thesz,,,"I implemented a variant of LSM in C# (BerkeleyDB feature/bug compatible, more or less) for our internal DB server (OO/relational DB).<p>Yes, it is true that LSM can incur a O(logN) read amplification, it was clearly shown in our bare storage tests. But! The full table scan read in full server has 3% (three percent) difference between different storages (LSM is 3% slower). And, as I haven&#x27;t used BTrees for LSM levels, but some other superficially similar structures with different construction (and no modification - MVCC), the read of complex structures from our DB (a PCB project - you can guess complexity) netted in clear benefit - that read operation was from 16 (sixteen) to 19 (nineteen) percents faster compared to BerkeleyDB. Given that BerkeleyDB storage backend has not occupied more than 20% of server runtime in our profiles, it amounts to 5 to 20 times speedup in read operations.<p>This can be explained like using the following argument: because Btree gets fragmented when you randomly insert things - pages get scattered all over the place. The rebuild phase I employed made pages much less scattered (actually, there cannot be more than some fixed number (8 in our case) different contiguous runs of pages to hold all data). This amounted to radical difference in read performance.<p>Take a look: <a href=""https://cs.brown.edu/research/pubs/theses/masters/2010/newton.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cs.brown.edu/research/pubs/theses/masters/2010/newto...</a><p>The paper above discusses Btree fragmentation and proposes something like small LSM structure for indices.",1445867897

I really like that formulation. Your job gets a lot easier as soon as you provide more value than you charge for it. Seems like that was one of the big problems with Homejoy: they were not able to charge more. The reality is that home cleaning is very price competitive. Anyone with a mop and a bucket can undercut your price, and as long as the customer trusts them and likes them they have no reason to switch. For example I know of a 12 year old kid who decided to start his own cleaning business. He calls it &quot;a boy and a bucket&quot;, and from what I am told does a fantastic job. He also charges about 1/2 of the market rate around where I live, yet provides a superb service.",1445867840

A lot of these business could be hobby or other casual enterprises, tax avoidance schemes, and doomed businesses started by naive people. It doesn&#x27;t mean a whole lot without some more context.<p>All models are wrong, but some are useful.  That particular stat covers a pretty good cross section of legitimate small businesses.  Some small businesses may be a cover for an underground marinara sauce operation used by the mafia to funnel dollars to a dog fighting operation.....  Sure we could muddy it up more, but I don&#x27;t think that stat is all that malicious or disingenuous.<p>> Become a teacher!<p>This claim does seem to be a bit disingenuous and exaggerated.

Then when people sign up and get something out of partial participation, it makes no sense to use a successful grind game metric measurement when its a failed grind game therefore the players aren&#x27;t cooperating because they feel no need to do so.

Setting an arbitrary cap isn&#x27;t a bad coping mechanism, but you might end up with pervasive low-level nesting, even though you almost certainly don&#x27;t need it.<p>In almost all cases I see, when people nest with SASS (or less), they don&#x27;t really mean &quot;in this context, this item is styled like this&quot;, what they mean is &quot;this item only ever exists in this context&quot;.  And if you use nesting for <i>that</i>, then you have at least one of three problems:<p>- it might be entirely redundant - as in you get exactly the same style if you just omit the surrounding selector blocks.  This is quite common if you&#x27;re using classes heavily.\n - it might be a &quot;clever&quot; way to avoid using a class name.  This is terrible idea; it&#x27;s not clever to call something `.frugal > div > span > span > b`, not even via nesting, it&#x27;s simply undescriptive.  Give the beast a name already, and use that. If you&#x27;re after this style, why not use inline style tags?  (No seriously - that&#x27;s not as terrible as it sounds).\n - You&#x27;ve got too many catch-all selectors, and are fighting a selector specificity battle.  Nesting here is again a really, <i>really</i> terrible solution, because you&#x27;ve just made the problem that much worse.  Nobody is ever going to understand why the components layout breaks when they refactor if and one layer is added or removed.  If your style depends delicately on these kinds of interactions, you&#x27;re in a world of pain.  Use @import, and consider refactoring your usage of general or catch-all selectors.<p>I think its good advice to avoid nesting, especially more than one level of nesting. It&#x27;s never necessary (just use compound selectors instead), and where compound selectors turn into a tedious, repetitive mess you&#x27;ve got techdebt you should be resolving, not making worse.<p>Avoid doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;never use&quot; - but if your css has even one instance of three-level deep nesting, I feel confident in suggesting that you&#x27;re making things fancier than they need to be.

For my use case, almost all calls will be from automated, non-interactive systems while perhaps 1% of calls will be from users in a browser. From industry as well as academic papers, here are the styles that I&#x27;ve seen thus far:<p>- Username/password provided in the clear (whether or not they use TLS to secure the channel)\n- Generated token provided in the clear (whether or not they use TLS to secure the channel)\n- A token with two parts: public and private where a signature is generated from the contents of the HTTP request, e.g. URL, request method, HTTP headers, etc.<p>Furthermore, I&#x27;ve seen the above values located in various places on the HTTP request:<p>- The &quot;userinfo&quot; portion of the request\n- In one or more query string parameters\n- The Authorization HTTP header\n- Various other custom headers, e.g. X-Authentication, X-Api-Key, etc.<p>A lot of the academic guidance I&#x27;ve seen points to signed requests with the signature populated in the Authorization header as being the most secure and canonical location for the authentication information. The trouble is that, except in a few cases, &quot;industry guidance&quot; (e.g. the API specifications of major industry players) does not follow the academic findings. Industry players typically will use a generated token sent in the clear in the query string or in the Authorization header.<p>It appears that the main concern around providing a signature-based approach is a decreased adoption of an API. This style appears to significantly increase the barrier to entry for using a given API. Wouldn&#x27;t providing language-specific SDKs or at least sample code in multiple languages reduce or eliminate this concern?<p>I&#x27;m definitely not interested in inventing some weird, custom authentication scheme, but I am curious to hear everyone&#x27;s thoughts on this.",1445867379

It&#x27;s the engine that drives them, in the same way a fall of water drives a water mill. People start startups in the hope of becoming much richer than they were before. And if your society tries to prevent anyone from being much richer than anyone else, it will also prevent one person from being much richer at t2 than t1.<p>He acknowledges that people don&#x27;t do things just for financial reward. People build products because they love building things. The things  you have to pay founders for is doing the mundane operational support that is required for most projects. No one likes doing that.<p>He goes on to argue that inequality is the result of people being able to more effectively use their talents. The &quot;10x programmer&quot; isn&#x27;t paid 10x as much, but few programmers could argue that he should not get paid a lot more than just an average programmer despite being much more effective.<p>I get that inequality is distasteful, but I would rather be richer in a less equal economy that be poorer but average.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/inequality.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/inequality.html</a>",1445867219

Now there&#x27;s a lot of renewables installed the grid is starting to look like the bottleneck.  Who pays for the grid upgrades so that it&#x27;s not the bottleneck?  The renewable people say the grid people should, and the grid people say that the renewable people should.<p>If there was so, so much money in the renewables market then why are they balking at paying for installing more long haul transmission lines?  Probably because they&#x27;re very expensive; if they were just 1% of the cost of the renewable facility nobody would really care.  But they&#x27;re probably on par with or perhaps even more expensive than the total plant installation.  Which takes these projects from profitable versus thermal to non-profitable versus thermal I&#x27;d suspect.  Hence the bickering.<p>So thermal balancing is a well understood art that&#x27;s going on 100 years old now.  Renewable balancing is not as well understood and is perhaps only 5-10 years old at any kind of scale.  That&#x27;s why grid batteries are such a big deal, because balancing is hard and batteries tend to have little/no latency so they can react faster than natural gas peaker plants.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that moving to renewables is a bad idea and that we should just stick with coal or anything; renewables are obviously the future.  But there are definite, real problems associated with their roll-out that aren&#x27;t easily or cheaply solved.

Of course the opposite has happened, the price of oil dropped very sharply and so it makes no sense for the IMF loan to have been put into use on these grounds. Which is why it hasn&#x27;t been, the $6.2b line of credit with the IMF expired in August 2014, without having been used at all. In July of that year, a new similar (this time, $5b) loan was negotiated, again precautionary as an insurance policy, and that, too, hasn&#x27;t been used yet and that too isn&#x27;t tied to any solar project. So I still don&#x27;t see where you get the fact they&#x27;re either 1) building this project with IMF money or 2) unlocking an IMF loan with this project, the facts suggest the IMF loan is unrelated, precautionary, not-used and the one you refer to specifically even expired already, how it could be unlocked after it expired is beyond me but you seem adamant.

However it&#x27;s not always behaving like one.<p>For uppercase, instead of using the actual uppercase sz-ligature glyph (ẞ, see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_%E1%BA%9E"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_%E1%BA%9E</a>) Germans will actually replace the &quot;ligature&quot; with SS. You could argue that this makes it an obvious ligature (although it would then be mislabeled as it&#x27;s obviously an ss-ligature, not an sz-ligature) but Germans also write out umlauts as the base letter followed by e (ü -> ue, ä -> ae, ö -> oe) and these wouldn&#x27;t normally be considered ligatures. The sz-ligature is also often called &quot;sharp s&quot;, further showing it&#x27;s not really thought of as a ligature.<p>According to Wikipedia the ß has been around since as early as the fourteenth century but its history seems a bit nebulous. I would think that it just used to be a common ligature before orthography became standardized in German and later became a character of its own when orthography became more standardized. Modern German orthography actually has a strict rule for picking between ß and ss: short vowels are followed by ss and long vowels are followed by ß (eliminating the ambiguity between Masse (mass) and Maße (metrics/dimensions)).<p>But another thing ß and the umlauts have in common is that they&#x27;re not considered part of the alphabet. Children learn the same &quot;Latin&quot; alphabet as in English (except for the names of the letters, obviously) and if anything, Ä, Ö and Ü are added to the end on charts (but not typically in mnemonic songs or rhymes). Incidentally, ß is rarely added in those cases at all (likely because it has no accepted uppercase variant and only occurs in the middle or end of words, unlike A-Z and the umlauts).<p>And don&#x27;t get me started on sorting. There are actually two legitimate ways to sort words in German: either you treat umlauts as vowel+e and ß as ss, OR you list ä after a, ö after o and so on. I think the former has become the norm for most intents and purposes but the other one can still be found in various places (including, I think, print phone books).<p>So, yes it&#x27;s confusing, but German &quot;Eszett&quot; is not <i>just</i> a ligature and German umlauts are not <i>just</i> vowels with diaereses (unlike e.g. ë in names like &quot;Zoë&quot; where the diaeresis just indicates that the &quot;oe&quot; should be read as two separate vowels). Nobody really knows where this entire mess started but at least we generally have come up with consistent rationalisations for how we use them.",1445866117

Or something that does not involve everybody keeping their jobs at way above-market pay in a company that can&#x27;t make payroll.<p>He&#x27;s welcome to do this experiment, but maybe we should all wait to make sure it succeeds before getting too excited about it, and demanding that anyone who thinks it likely to fail consider themselves bad people who should feel bad. All the best to him (again, no sarcasm at all), but the most likely outcome is that he goes out of business in the next recession.",1445864658

I did the complete automata class mostly to see if there&#x27;s much new since I did a brick and mortar version some decades ago, and the &quot;reward&quot; was not exactly fulfilling.  I&#x27;m not expecting Ullman to fly out and shake my hand, or my phone to ring off the hook from recruiters seeing I jumped thru some hoops, but something more would have been nice?  Actually, anything would have been nice?<p>Since the grind factor was aggressively burned out of me, I haven&#x27;t completed a single course.  I did watch the videos and did the assignments for computational neuroscience and one of the multi-class algo series and the functional programming and the famous AI class.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of talk about how grinders don&#x27;t grind therefore grinders suck or grinding sucks.  However what really sucks is the playground presented to the grinders.  Its not their fault they aren&#x27;t being given something worth grinding.<p>By analogy most MMORPGs that tanked and died, tanked and died because the grind experience sucked.  Its not the fault of the grinders that the businessmen couldn&#x27;t or wouldn&#x27;t present something as enjoyably grindable as WoW or Eve.<p>To some extent the whole market segment of MOOCs smells like a freshmen psych class lab experiment, &quot;what happens to grind performance when you leave all the annoyance factors of grinds in place but remove all the rewards, with the hypothesis that almost every rat in the box stops grinding&quot;",1445864644

He does what he believes the right thing to do. Plus side, giving higher salaries usually has a positive effect on your job after all, as long as you can afford it. It seems to work for him and hopefully it will lead some others to do similar things.<p>But just by looking at this and universally forcing higher minimum wages may create unwanted consequences (Such as Lay offs, increase in un-documented exchanges or tax evasion simply because employers with already razor thin profits cannot afford salaries anymore.).

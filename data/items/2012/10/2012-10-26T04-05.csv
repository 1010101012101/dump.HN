<i>""... a prototype non-lethal crowd-control weapon that emits a beam of microwaves at 95 gigahertz. Radiation at that frequency penetrates less than half a millimetre into the skin, so the beam was supposed to deliver an intense burning sensation to anyone in its path, forcing them to move away, but without, in theory, causing permanent damage. 
 However, the day of the test was cold and rainy. The water droplets in the air did what moisture always does: they absorbed the microwaves. And when some of the reporters volunteered to expose themselves to the attenuated beam, they found that on such a raw day, the warmth was very pleasant.""</i>",1351227501

The user would be able to intercept any API calls the app makes to an external program, at the very least capturing/spoofing the signal to the I/O drivers. The only way to make a secure system in this sense is if the software can establish a chain of trust and be confident that it is not running on top of 'compromised' software. An solution to this, which I believe is common on phones with official support for rooting, is to have a cryptographiclly secure way for a software to verify it is running on a non-rooted stack (I assume through signatures). At least this way, the only thing that disabling the system-wide DRM will cost you are the apps that specifically request the system-wide DRM. A better solution that I have not seen implemented, is to be able to run both a rooted stack, and a provably non-rooted stack at the same time.

You may prove that 3 cycles will bring an even input to a lower output, but that output may be odd, in which case the next 3 cycles will not necessarily produce a lower output.  In fact, after 6 cycles, the output may be greater than the original input.  I shall drive the point home that any argument of this form must fail:<p>If you name any integer n, I can find a starting value such that the first 2n Collatz steps are ""3n+1 n/2 3n+1 n/2 3n+1 n/2 ..."", so that the output gets up to roughly (3/2)^n * [the input]--which can obviously be <i>much</i> greater than the input--as much greater as I want.  This starting value is ""any number that is 1 less than a multiple of 2^n"", or, in more occult language, ""any number that is 1 mod 2^n"".  Observe:<p><pre><code>  k * 2^n - 1 is odd.
    => 3n+1, we get 3k * 2^n - 3 + 1
  3k * 2^n - 2 is even.
    => n/2, we get 3k * 2^(n-1) - 1
  3k * 2^(n-1) - 1 is odd.
    => 3n+1, we get 9k * 2^n-1 - 3 + 1
  9k * 2^n-1 - 2 is even.
    => n/2, we get 9k * 2^n-2 - 1
  9k * 2^n-2 - 1 is odd.
    => 3n+1, we get 27k * 2^n-2 - 3 + 1
  27k * 2^n-2 - 2 is even.
    => n/2, we get 27k * 2^n-3 - 1
  27k * 2^n-3 - 1 is odd.
  ...
  3^n * k * 2^0 - 1 might be odd or even, depending on k.
</code></pre>
You might try, say, starting with n=127.  By the above argument, that will go up to 2186 after 14 steps (and will be at 4372 the step before that).<p>By the way, I figured that stuff out by recursively saying:<p><pre><code>  We want the biggest result possible.
  Therefore, we want the last step to be 3n+1.
  Therefore we want the number before the last to be odd.
    This number must have come from an n/2 step.
  Therefore the number before that must be 2 mod 4.
    We want this to have come from a 3n+1 step.
    3n+1 is 2 mod 4; 3n is 1 mod 4; n is 3 mod 4.
  n was 3 mod 4.
    This must have come from an n/2 step.
  n was 6 mod 8.
    We want this to have come from 3n+1.
    3n+1 is 6 mod 8; 3n is 5 mod 8.
    Come to think of it, 5 is -3 mod 8.
    Then, clearly, n is -1 mod 8.
  n was -1 mod 8.
    This came from n/2.
  n was -2 mod 16.
    We want this to have been 3n+1.
    3n+1 = -2 mod 16; 3n = -3 mod 16; n = -1 mod 16.
  n was -1 mod 16.
    At this point, the pattern of ""-1 mod 2^n"" is
    waving its arms and screaming in our face.
</code></pre>
I'm a little embarrassed to admit that I took a much dumber approach, which I automated beyond ""15 mod 16"" (intending merely to provide some numbers and describe the procedure to get them), and didn't see until I saw the output that it was always 2^n - 1, and didn't know how to prove it until I wrote the above.

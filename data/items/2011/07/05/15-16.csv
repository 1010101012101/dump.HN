The thing about the ebay business model is, that it acts as a market place (like Amazon), but actually is more a social network (for people who want to buy and sell stuff). Thus your main problem is the ""empty disco effect"". Nobody wants to join a disco, that is empty and so a disco stays empty. Only if a certain amount of people starts using your service, you will get others to join in. Some of your weapons of choice are viral marketing (like Dropbox: bribe them to invite their friends + have a great product at hand that they want to show off with), integrating into a big social network (like Farmville or in some way ""Angry Birds"") and buying + integrating niche networks that do already, what you want to do (no example at hand). Of course other ways are also possible. How do you want to tackle that social threshold?",1309881031

You can read about it under the heading ""What role does the bond market play in all of this?"" in this article I already linked to elsewhere: <a href=""http://pragcap.com/resources/understanding-modern-monetary-system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragcap.com/resources/understanding-modern-monetary-s...</a> and also in Randall Wray's book ""Understanding Modern Money"".<p>Quite a number of economists in the MMT line of thought actually argue in favour of letting the interest rate drop to zero, and using fiscal policy instead of monetary policy for inflation targeting.<p>In other words, government debt does not need to be a way of taking from the poor. It is that way as a result of political choice - though I do not think that it was a conscious choice, since people have not really internalised how our monetary system works these days.",1309880754

What if they gave you information in person and now want to hide it from you specifically?""<p>That's the mental model I, personally, use for social networks: any information you choose to publish on it is fair game for whatever your friends want to do with it (and they can do whatever they want with any information I publish on it). Anyone who does not want to be contacted (or have their contact information exported into other formats - such as the linking of name and email address which is required to email) should not make it available - there's no reason to publish an email if you don't want to be emailed, and no reason to publish a phone number if you don't want to be called.",1309880732

I would hope they also do things like battery life test given that recently it has come to light that most android apps murder battery life for no good reason.<p>- No consumer contact --> amazon needs to fix this asap. It is critical for vendors to be able to contact their clients.<p>- No refund policy --> is this even legal in the US? I think we just need to take it to court to find out :( It is quite refreshing to hear that app developers actively refund to make frustrated customers happy. However on that note, the main reason for this is because Apple can FORCE your app to be removed from your device if you get a refund, google/amazon cannot. therefore amazon is trying to prevent people from just downloading and then asking for a refund thus legally getting a free app. Not to mention the fact that rooted devices (htc is going to allow rooting without hacking bootloader now) can do things like give amazon/google the finger when it comes to asking the device to uninstall apps, even if its built-in.<p>- Cannot quickly deploy fix in 30 minutes --> this is true for the Apple store too. I think going with the release cycle, this can be either a good or bad thing. Ensures you test your fixes and try releasing asap. I think in many cases the approval process is justified because it prevents things like malware from being pushed as an update.<p>tl;dr<p>- I like Apple App Store approval process\n - Amazon needs to heavily focus on client <-> developer communication channels. Even if not email and in-app store.\n - Refund policy is possibly legitimate due to uninstall concerns.",1309879663

It is very easy to stay motivated when the tutorial is so focused on producing something that you like.<p>The only thing that I thought was missing was a discussion about micro and macro pulses in 4/4 versus 3/4 versus 6/8, because it is a simple concept that is easy to teach but offers the student much more variety of options in choosing a time signature. As a music teacher, I usually approach the issue by having students count 4/4 aloud (""<i>1</i> 2 <i>3</i> 4, noting that 1 and 3 are accented slightly) and 3/4 aloud (<i>1</i> 2 3, noting that beat 1 is accented). This teaches not just the structure of the time signatures but helps the student internalize them, which I've found speeds up learning and understanding without sacrificing the student's ability to understand what principles make rhythms work the way they do. (This would have made syncopation a <i>lot</i> easier to teach later in the article-- it can be defined as simply rhythms that don't conform to the usual micro/macro pulse of a time signature, i.e. <i>1</i> 2 3 <i>4</i>, etc)<p>Also, one of the easiest ways to grok the time signature concept is to say the signature aloud like it's a fraction. i.e., 4/4 is ""four fourths"", 6/8 is ""sixth eighths"" etc. It really is that easy, and this approach <i>combined with</i> the understanding that the lower value gets one beat and there are x of them per measure usually makes time signatures one of the easiest sections of my theory courses.<p>Still, it's hard to criticize a tutorial that has you producing music so quickly.",1309878753

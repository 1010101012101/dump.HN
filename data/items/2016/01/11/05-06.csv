10879099,comment,10872852,10878510,0,0,pron,,,"> It&#x27;s &quot;conservative&quot; to take as an assumption a prediction from your &quot;theory&quot;?<p>It&#x27;s not a &quot;theory&quot; any more than the the big bang is a &quot;theory&quot;. It is the result of decades (nay, centuries) of research, and I don&#x27;t see why you&#x27;d scoff at it so smugly (and ignorantly). Second, of course it is conservative. As I explained to someone else here, I am not expecting individuals to change their behavior without coordination. Nash equilibria can&#x27;t be escaped that way anyway. The responsibility is on society. A society that acts to ensure things stay as they are is carrying out a conservative agenda.<p>I don&#x27;t think I understand your question, though. Working to keep things as they are is a conservative ideology. Periods of relative stability are a historical fact. Those periods have been no doubt assisted by conservative ideology (although ideology is far from being the <i>only</i> social force), which is nothing new either. Where do you see the contradiction? People, with their opinions and needs and fears and desires and hysteria and ideology and actions and follies are the ones making the system. They are the observers, object and subjects of the system&#x27;s behavior all at the same time. In a dynamical system with feedback you could be predicting a result, making it, and directing it based on your agenda at the same time. There&#x27;s perfect coherence here. Look at election polls; they are somewhat similar: they both predict the result and make it, and there&#x27;s a lot of political agenda involved (or see my examples of some dynamical systems here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10874683"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10874683</a>).<p><i>How</i> people behave and how they <i>should</i> behave are two perhaps equally interesting but completely different questions. If it is your opinion that people <i>should</i> behave in a way that simply mirrors <i>how</i> other people behave, then yes, your answer to the second question is &quot;according to conservative ideology&quot;. If you think that my opinion is that on occasion people <i>should</i> behave in a way that isn&#x27;t in accordance with their immediate, narrow material self-interest, then you&#x27;d be correct. If, however, you think that I think that people often behave this way, then you&#x27;d be wrong.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s not &quot;conservative&quot; but conservative, just as you are not a &quot;conservative&quot; but a conservative.",1452491976

10879096,comment,10877616,10877616,0,0,jroseattle,,,"I was at AOL years ago when Starboard started a proxy fight with Tim Armstrong. They were &quot;activists&quot;, which is to say they were looking for public support to break up and sell the company. Armstrong took them on and brought his own public offensive, explaining why the AOL long-term strategy was better than the short-term breakup that Starboard was touting. Armstrong prevailed in his quest and eventually Starboard bowed out, eventually selling a chunk of their position in the company.<p>Two years later, AOL was bought by Verizon.<p>Armstrong was a relatively strong leader in that situation. He was a salesman at heart and knew he needed to reinforce his strategies (however non-plausible those might have been) with the company, the Board, the shareholders and AOL customers.<p>Mayer looks like none of that to me, and remarkably tone deaf against Starboard. Sorry to those Yahoos still hanging on, but Starboard are simply vultures for distressed companies. Not sure how long it will last, but the chances of an independent Yahoo being open for business in 3 years is really low.",1452491940

I was about to declare bankruptcy because I couldn&#x27;t sell property that I couldn&#x27;t use and cost me at least $1300 / mo and increasing with no expectation of the possibility of selling (and to protect my other personal assets). It would have cost me another $40k+ that I didn&#x27;t think I could recover back in 7 years for various reasons not to mention the sheer opportunity costs.<p>For another tech company example, HP&#x27;s physical assets on the books exceeded the market cap of the company a couple years ago. The meaning is that even if HP is able to make a profit that the business is so unattractive to hold a long position that investors want to dump their shares (in bulk) - someone will be left holding the stock and nobody wants to be sucked at the end unless you are private equity or something and want to flip the company basically. There&#x27;s also still potentially cooked books from when HP bought Autonomy, and that&#x27;s priced in as the bet by how bad it&#x27;s scope would be. As fate so happened, HP wound up selling a bunch of land it owned in Cupertino to Apple for its new campus indicating it has no plans to expand in that area it used to dominate the industry (most US employees are in low cost of living areas for HP now consistent with companies that are in survival mode moreso than innovation / growth mode).",1452491564

WAT?<p>> And if it is to be a real problem then it also demonstrates why you can&#x27;t solve it.<p>I studied history in grad school. And one of the constant things in history is that people will always explain why the problem can&#x27;t be solved. You can go online and read some of the extremely elaborate, pseudo-intellectual explanations why letting women vote would be disastrous, why slavery is good for blacks, and why women should never be allowed to practice law or medicine. Yet social action solved all three. I could try to explain why your reasoning is wrong but it would take too long. In short, you think that the solution must necessarily solve the proximate cause without studying the ultimate cause, and you&#x27;re wrong about what constitutes the main effect. The &quot;open system&quot; accounts for a very small portion of the problem.<p>One of the advantages to studying history is the perspective you get about things that today seem natural and immutable to us, and then you learn that things haven&#x27;t always been like that. The social structure in society is constantly changing. The only question is do we want to help direct the change as much as we can, or act like incurious beings, that just let things happen to them without understanding them. I always find it curious (though not really; it is a known and familiar phenomenon, which happens over and over) how it is the people who are otherwise the most curious about nature and technology become primitive and unquestioning when it comes to human society. All of a sudden the model is either too simple, or too complex, and we certainly cannot change it. Which is funny because people had never flown (on wings) before the invention of the airplane, yet people have completely changed the social structure over and over, through political activism.",1452491059

They don&#x27;t do things intuitively, they invent unconventional UI paradigms, and they are extensively configurable, so they need a manual that begins with &quot;how to read this manual&quot;.<p>The workshop analogy builds on a false premise of low configuration equating to underpowered function. A pro will use a lot of different speciality tools that have no or minimal configuration, vs. a Swiss Army Knife that is mediocre at everything. In the same way, Unix-style workflows are very &quot;shoot yourself in the foot&quot; stuff, but formal configuration of each tool is minimal.<p>The best thing a complex application can do is be a general-purpose programming API at its core, with common workflows surfaced as a polished, simpified UI. Each of those workflows is its own application, with internal developer documentation to orient someone who wants to hack on it. Then the 80% cases are solved by default, and the 99% cases(&quot;this thing doesn&#x27;t let me configure x&quot;) are solved by copy-pasting the application code and modifying a single line based on a Stack Overflow answer.

Start changing things in your life, anything at all, but particularly things that bring you into contact with new people. Every little change you make shifts your perspective. With enough shifts, you&#x27;ll suddenly realize that you see new horizons where before you only saw a blank wall.<p>Oh, and you are right, a lot of things in software are unnecessarily complex, the result of people not learning from the mistakes of the past, of people adding abstraction to hide complexity, only to produce more complexity, of people who don&#x27;t know what they don&#x27;t know ignorantly, arrogantly forging ahead, and, of course, the detritus of shifting business strategies in a shifting landscape. Some of this is inevitable, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t opportunities to clean up some messes and avoid making new ones.<p>Good luck, you&#x27;ve got time to figure things out, until you don&#x27;t, at which point, you aren&#x27;t.",1452489746

It’s just an issue of how much and how quickly.&quot;<p>Not mentioned in the article kindly submitted here, but likely to be of interest to many readers of Hacker News, is the site PubPeer[1] where you can search by topic for discussions among researchers (some named, some anonymous) about scientific papers that may have problems. Some papers have been retracted after PubPeer discussion revealed problems with the underlying data for study results.<p>[1] <a href=""https://pubpeer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pubpeer.com/</a><p><a href=""http://retractionwatch.com/2015/08/31/pubpeer-founders-reveal-themselves-create-foundation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://retractionwatch.com/2015/08/31/pubpeer-founders-revea...</a>",1452488770

You might hear an aside in a lecture about X, and you could simply write X in your notebook. Later on, you could search your notes for X, and if you were wondering what exactly was said about X, you can tap on that note to hear what was happening in the lecture at that point in time.<p>Later on, Y might be brought up in relation to X. Write Y in the notebook, and draw a line to X, and so on.<p>I am not much of a note taker nowadays, but I highly recommend trying out the LiveScribe. I am considering buying a new one just to see how things have progressed.",1452488727

These results don&#x27;t happen because they were supposed to happen. It&#x27;s just what did happen.<p>E.g. you hit an exception that should have never popped up. Does it read badly? Oh well of course it does, because nobody who could have written it more clearly knew it was even possible to pop up in this instance. He might have even tested your scenario, but his system package xyz wasn&#x27;t in version 13.4.12 as yours, but in 13.4.12b, so in his context it worked. You can minimize these things, but you can&#x27;t completely make them go away. Even make them go away most of the time is often too expensive. You can of course also choose to invest $500k every year into Babel to increase their testing, but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t, just to make a few exceptions more readable.<p>And in fact, if you tracked down from all the context variables why it failed in your context, you will actually find out that you can track down the change to an issue and a developer and you can discuss with them how in that case a better exception can be printed, how the code may need to be changed to consider the context you are providing etc.<p>Nothing of this is done better when reading usability guidelines. Just as well as you and me people mostly know what is good and what is bad. They don&#x27;t need teaching in that.<p>The thing that can be really done is always try harder in your code (when was the last time you looked into the docs/source of a lib function you use and catch the exceptions that function can throw, handle some of them and raise more readable exceptions for the once you can&#x27;t handle?). Secondly, when you hit such a situation you can spend the time to track down the error to its core, write a good issue about it, discuss with the responsible devs what to do and help implement the solution (have you looked at the underlying library functions, caught their exceptions... oh, you know what I mean, right? People often don&#x27;t do that part). Last but not least when one has done that often enough to be good at it, to spend time and energy to help some noobs to do the same (and teach them how to read the underlying library functions).",1452488716

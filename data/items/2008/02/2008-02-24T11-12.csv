122439,comment,122287,122434,0,0,asdflkj,,,"Her main thesis is that free market capitalism is bad. She doesn't try to disprove that free market capitalism is good. Instead, she attacks the character of famous proponents of it, by suggesting that they forced their will upon the unwilling populace. That's ad hominem.<p>I neither agree nor disagree with her about this last part, because I don't know enough about it. But I give her the benefit of the doubt.<p>The only way her argument could be not an ad hominem is if there was a causal link between the merit of the idea she is attacking and the populace's willingness to accept it. All I was trying to say is that there is no such link. I am not offering any solutions; just pointing out bad logic.",1203853535

Neither was completely in charge.<p>In the case of Jobs and Woz, its easy to see that they have differing skills. However, Jobs had to offer a very complimentary set of skills because he couldn't contribute directly in the creative process.",1203853424

If I had the power to ""pull the emergency send it back to reddit"" handle on your stories, well, your submissions would be reduced by 80%.",1203851835
122436,comment,122287,122360,0,0,NSX2,,,"Good point.  A few years back I was keeping track of this site that kept track of all the ""executive orders"" that were being signed post 9.11.<p>The first half year later they had a thorough analysis of each executive order.<p>Soon so many executive orders, each more disturbing than the last, were being signed that they gave up analyzing them completley and just had quick summaries.<p>Then soon they couldn't keep up and just listed them with links to info obtained by freedom of information orders.<p>In 2004, they were ""executive ordering"" at the rate of about 30,000 new pieces of ""emergency legislation"" per year and the site just shut down, unable to keep up.<p>NOW YOU JUST KNOW that dude from Texas isn't penning 30,000 pieces of legislation per year.  Heck - with all the vacationing, it's a wonder he even gets to sign it all.<p>Seems like you're right - all these things were prepared way in advance, just waiting for an opportunity.",1203851651
122435,comment,122268,122408,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>""... missed one: hgreddit => Mecurial ...""</i><p>And Paste. The most interesting thing I saw was the bug that caused it found right at the bottom:<p><pre><code>  ""... unindent does not match any outer indentation level (account.py, line 68) ...""
</code></pre>
This is such a pain with Python (having to line the indentation up) and is so trivial. Wonder how it got through testing? They do testing on reddit don't they?",1203851534

An ad hominem attack means you can't argue with the thesis so you personally attack the person putting forth the thesis in attempt to discredit the logic of the arguement by attacking the credibility of the person making it.<p>""It wasn't born in freedom and democracy, therefore it must be bad.""<p>That's nowhere near an ad hominem.  And basica logic would tend to indicate that if there are 2 sets of mutually exclusive, bad and good value conditions, ""not good set"" would tend to leave ""bad set"" as the only remaining possibility.<p>Also when you say, ""She makes the laughable assumption thta the majority of people know what's good for them"", you kind of tend to implicitly agree with her thesis.  It's almost like you're suggesting that everybody is an idiot, therefore everyone needs a big-brother type group making problems and then exploiting the resulting panic to shove solutions down everyone's throat because left to their own devices, people don't know any better.",1203851373

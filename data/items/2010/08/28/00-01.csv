Unfortunately, your writing is very unclear and difficult to follow.<p>Since I'm waiting for the delivery guy to bring dinner, I'll add my dim understanding of Reinhardt's post. Landsburg writes, ""When Jack gains $10 and Jill loses $5, social gains increase by $5, so the policy is a good one."" Reinhardt disagree that this is <i>always</i> ""good"". Society must make a value judgement about Jill's loses: if it's her last $5, is the policy still good? And if Jack is a billionaire, would that $10 gain offset Jill's suffering?<p>He's not saying that economists <i>never</i> think about this problem. He's saying that economists often will make a policy recommendation (lower tax on capital, higher tax on income) that presumably raises social welfare, while skipping over the ethical issues (higher tax on the poor, lower tax on the rich).<p>We want to pump $10 billion into the economy now. Should we give tax rebates as a % of taxes paid (more to rich, less to poor)? Or should we cut the payroll tax by a few thousand dollars (same for everyone, but more meaningful for poor)? The result is the same ($10B), but Reinhardt says there's a value judgement in the choice. This issue pops up everywhere, particularly in health care.",1282955465

While this is popular (eg key-value NoSQL stores, and dynamic typing in  Ruby, Python, Perl), it's not right for everything. If you did want typed data, you'd probably just use XML Schema, since everything is already there.<p>I ask because of a startup idea based on XML Schema. It <i>could</i> survive XML Schema going away, but I'm not so sure about the apparent long-term trend away from schemas/types altogether. With fast-enough computers to nullify the speed advantage of static types, will the remaining advantage of type-safety be valuable enough on its own - What is the evidence for and against? Even databases are going schemaless (it seems).",1282954708

1640753,comment,1639458,1639458,0,0,mmaunder,,,"A rare, wonderful and inspiring look inside the greatest marketing organization ever created.<p>Many businesses create Ogilvy style campaigns that sell benefits (rather than features). For example:<p>""Only Dove is one-quarter moisturizing cream""<p>""At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock""<p>Apple understands that they are essentially in a commodity business much like Nike. It's tough to sell benefits in that environment when your benefits are the same as everyone else's. In the market they're in, everyone already understands what the benefits are and most people can use a spreadsheet, word processor or web browser equally well on an Apple or PC.<p>What Apple did is create a new intangible and very powerful benefit with Think Different:<p>The words ""Think different"" translated into an Ogilvy style headline would say: ""If you buy this product your friends and peers will think you are different and you will stand out from the crowd."". It's not possible to communicate that directly because it's an embarrassing subject. The Think Different campaign takes a wonderful indirect approach to addressing a sensitive issue and communicating that benefit.<p>This approach of creating a new intangible and emotional benefit in a commodity market has worked so well for Apple that they have incorporated the marketing approach into the entire organization including their sales strategy and their products. Whereas before their products focused on differentiated features, now they focus on emotional differentiation. Apple stores are an emotional experience.<p>Apple's smaller market share facilitates this approach because their customers have been the minority. So you're automatically ""different"" if you buy Apple. These days that is less true, so it will be interesting to watch the marketing organization evolve as their market dominance increases.<p>Here are my notes from the video:<p>1. Marketing is about values<p>2. You don't have much of a chance to get people to remember you.<p>3. You have to be really clear on what you want people to know about you.<p>4. A great brand needs investment and caring if it's going to retain it's relevance and vitality.<p>5. At the time of this video Apple's brand had suffered from neglect.<p>6. Don't talk about features.<p>7. Nike makes you feel something different from a shoe company.<p>8. Nike honors great athletes and they honor great athletics.<p>9. The question Apple asked was ""Our customers want to know who is Apple and what is it that Apple stands for? Where does Apple fit in this world?""<p>10. Apple is not about making boxes to help people get their jobs done.<p>11. Apple's core value is that ""We believe that people with passion can change the world for the better.""<p>12. Apple is going back to their core value mentioned in 12.<p>13. ""Values and core values mostly shouldn't change"" ~Jobs<p>14. ""The things that Apple believed at it's core are the same things Apple stands for today""<p>15. The ad is a way to communicate this.<p>16. Jobs is clearly and intentionally emotionally engaged with the ad and that engages his audience.<p>17. The ideas above were distilled into ""Think Different.""",1282954266

It's possible that it works in the opposite way: because we think of direction egocentrically, in order to give directions, you have to imagine yourself in someone else's shoes. You also end up with phrases like ""Who's 'left'? My left or your left?"" which draws attention to the fact that two people see the world differently. Really, our idea of direction promotes the Western cultural idea of individuals as different from each other, and also the idea of equality between individuals. I can't force you to adopt my directions because you are facing a different way; literally, you have a different viewpoint.<p>Geographic directions transcend my own personal viewpoint, but they also transcend everyone else's viewpoint as well.

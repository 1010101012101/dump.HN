I think this would have reached Japan from mainland China. Also some research and folklore suggests that Bodhidarma was in fact a Pallava Prince who went to China and spread the marital art forms.

I loved the Amiga as a teenager, but I couldn&#x27;t afford all the books and development tools I needed. I had a frustrating time trying to piece together everything from magazines, coverdisks and half-baked public domain tools and consequently didn&#x27;t make much progress as a programmer.<p>I always had a feeling of unfinished business about it, that if things had been different I could have started a game development career in the 90&#x27;s rather than trying to make a name as an indie dev today.<p>I sometimes mess around in 68000 or in Blitz Basic on an emulator and it always strikes me how different it feels to code on an Amiga and how things have changed. When I&#x27;m coding on the Amiga, I can <i>focus</i>. Everything I need to know is in a few books that are ready to hand.<p>And because I can talk to the hardware directly in such an elegant language as 68000, I feel like I am engaging with the machine in a much more solid, craftsmanlike sense than when I&#x27;m coding at my day job, teetering at the top of a great tangled pile of platform layers that I must negotiate like a harassed digital bureaucrat.<p>It makes me think of how I thought computers would progress back then. As a teen I thought the computers of the future would be more <i>profound</i>, rather than merely more complex, as they are today. That they&#x27;d still be comprehensible to a single person but require more from them, like an expert martial artist or meditator or something.<p>That&#x27;s the Amiga for you.

10033413,comment,10031725,10033005,0,0,mkingston,,,"DiabloD3 almost certainly limited caloric intake at some point (at intake or somewhere in digestion). But your comment doesn&#x27;t address some complexity in the way the body processes food, or in the food itself. For example, eating 200 calories of refined sugar is considerably worse in terms of your eventual absorption of energy than eating 200 calories of banana. This is at least partly because the banana consumes more energy in digestion, and partly because less of the energy in the banana will actually eventually be absorbed by your body.<p>Parenthetically, the banana will not generate a considerable spike in blood sugar, something that, as I understand it, is very unhealthy.<p>While it&#x27;s not an <i>awful</i> rough guide, nutrition is not as simple as calories in vs. calories out. Better perhaps if you&#x27;re counting the calories in your stool, but who&#x27;s going to do that? (And besides, that still wouldn&#x27;t be a complete solution).<p>Also, in case you&#x27;re reading this DiabloD3, congratulations. A drastic and I&#x27;m sure extremely challenging lifestyle change.

10033407,comment,10031286,10033319,0,0,gjm11,,,"Yup! (I think <i>rathereasy</i> chose an unfortunate example.) The point is that AC implies that there is a way to put an ordering on <i>all</i> of R such that every nonempty subset has a smallest element.<p>It&#x27;s easy to find such an ordering for any countable subset -- i.e., one that set-theoretically is no bigger than the integers. For instance, we can do it for all the rational numbers by saying that we order numbers p/q (p,q integers, no common factor, q positive) by converting p/q to 2^signbit(p) 3^|p| 5^|q| or something of the kind, where signbit(x)=0 is what in C you write as (x<0), and comparing the positive integers that result.<p>It&#x27;s much harder to see how to do it for <i>all</i> the real numbers. In fact, you provably <i>can&#x27;t</i> see how, in the sense that there actually is known to be no construction that does it -- no way to say explicitly which numbers to put before which.<p>(This is a common pattern; cases where you need AC to do something are always ones where there is no explicit construction that does it. That kinda has to be true, because there are models of set theory in which AC is false.)",1439196730
10033406,comment,10032595,10033234,0,0,marcoperaza,,,"Another perspective: while Americans were building a prosperous society of free men, the Europeans were continuously slaughtering each other, first for dynastic power, and then to impose their top-down &quot;solutions&quot; to the social problems you&#x27;re talking about.  Today the Europeans have so saddled themselves with taxation and regulation that they underperform economically. Their welfare systems have not solved poverty, but have fostered a culture of dependency on the state.  In the pursuit of economic equality, they have succeeded mostly in raising the cost of living and creating a hostile environment for business. Because it&#x27;s impossible to fire someone, firms are wary to hire, contributing to staggering youth unemployment.  Minorities and immigrants are much more poorly integrated than in the US.  Europe exerts little influence on world politics outside of the EU. Yes, I&#x27;m presenting just one side of the picture, but it&#x27;s the side that&#x27;s consistently ignored when the American left is clamoring for European-style socialism.",1439196704

My answers in order:<p>I&#x27;ve never heard the term private blockchain and therefore not sure what you are referring to. If you mean a blockchain that is exclusively mined and used by a single entity, I don&#x27;t see the point. Perhaps people are piggy backing on the &quot;blockchain&quot; buzzword while creating something that is quite different?<p>A blockchain cannot exist without a currency/coin. Blockchains need a reward mechanism for miners who &quot;protect&quot; it and a cost for submitting transactions to prevent spam.<p>What keeps miners interested after all mining is done is an open question. As long as there is a reward for mining, there will be miners but if that reward drops too low, we could see the network&#x27;s hash rate drop substantially (miners quitting their job) and the blockchain would become more vulnerable to double spending attacks (a single miner intentionally &quot;undoing&quot; a large number of blocks).<p>There is no fixed transaction cost, each miner is free to decide how much they &quot;charge&quot; to mine transactions. I wasn&#x27;t aware that transaction costs had kept rising. Keep in mind that as the BTC/USD price fluctuates constantly, the average transaction cost in USD might change often while remaining the same in BTC.<p>In theory, the Satoshi client (original bitcoin) developers could release a new Bitcoin software which changes the Bitcoin consensus rules and anyone downloading this new release would be participating in a new &quot;altcoin&quot; which would be separate from the original Bitcoin. They could send or receive Bitcoins to people using the old software. For the Bitcoin protocol to change in a significant way, a large number of people would have to agree on the new rules.",1439195806

Generally, by `time` we mean &quot;distance in time since last Midnight in one second resolution&quot; and that includes single clock source. By `date` we generally mean &quot;distance in time since last particular arbitrary event in one day resolution&quot;, which includes two clock sources (midnight and new year). This gets rather awkward, but both sources get controlled by the &quot;particular arbitrary event&quot;, therefore we can handle that. Combining both definitions into &quot;distance in time since arbitrary event in one second resolution&quot; gives us `datetime`, controlled by three clock sources. Thing are bound to get awkward.<p>Lastly, as others have already pointed out, all this makes definitions of future events in `datetime` pretty much useless, because there is no way to predict how many ticks clock sources will generate, unless you stick with one (e.g. n Universe clocked seconds from NOW (isn&#x27;t TAI exactly that?)) and deal with fluctuating clock sources in the future.<p>Neither solution solve inherent problems with multi-clocked `datetime` definition only might make some problems easier to solve by shifting clock tracking to frontend: 2051-09-12 16:23:00 +0300 does not need to keep track of clock sources while 2051-09-12 16:23:00 Europe/Vilnius does.<p>The whole &quot;Bonus&quot; section is about arbitrary{ty|ness} of &quot;last midnight&quot; - how long ago did it actually happen for this moving target? Should I consider offset from last midnight from time I have actually seen it or when it was supposed to be seen here? Automatic time zone settings attempt to do the latter.

A Blue Card acquirer must present a valid travel document (and in specific cases a valid residence permit or a national long-term visa) and documents proving the relevant higher professional qualification.<p>Here is more information regarding Germany (but it is from 2008): <a href=""http://www.wohin-auswandern.de/blue-card-en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wohin-auswandern.de/blue-card-en</a><p>To be honest, the salary probably won&#x27;t be a problem, with your expertise you should be able to land a pretty decent job.",1439194615

9100213,comment,9099820,9100163,0,0,xyzzyz,,,"Ah, the joys of learning math from slides without the talk the slides were helpers to.<p>The objects here are not necessarily sets, and the arrows are not necessarily functions -- this is actually one of the points of category theory, to abstract the notion of morphism away from set theory. This becomes necessary, when in your regular mathematical life you encounter morphisms which are not strictly functions, but nevertheless in many ways behave as such. Best example would be the homotopy classes of maps between topological spaces. Homotopy classes do not map points from domain space to codomain space, but nevertheless you can compose them, there&#x27;s a homotopy class of identity, which acts as an identity on composition, sometimes there are homotopy classes that are inverses and so on.<p>If this sounds complicated and unnatural, that&#x27;s because it is: it is pointless to learn category theory before learning where and how it is useful. This is completely opposite order than in which it was conceived, and totally misses the purpose the category theory, which is to make everything clearer, to reduce the number of notions, to make it easier to notice analogous behavior between separate concepts, to reduce number of repeating arguments. Learning what a morphism or functor or natural transformation is, without having tens of examples of these notions, only increases the number of concepts without a corresponding increase in understanding.<p>My advice is, if you want to learn category theory, learn algebraic topology first, or at least abstract algebra (groups, rings, modules, fields). Otherwise, you&#x27;ll see very little purpose, and very little use.",1424782360
9100212,comment,9099820,9100163,0,0,tel,,,"Heh, not quite.<p>Treat objects and arrows abstractly like you&#x27;re building a graph. Actual meaning can be applied later. A category is thus a set (or proper class) of objects, O, and a set (or proper class) of arrows, A along with two mappings dom and cod from A -> O. The laws are first that for any object (o in O) there exists an arrow (id(o) in A) such that dom(id(o)) = o and cod(id(o)) = o and second that if you have two arrows (f, g in A) such that cod(f) = dom(g) then there is defined their composition (compose(f,g) in A) such that dom(compose(f,g)) = dom(f) and cod(compose(f,g)) = cod(g).<p>You can draw all that as the objects and arrows and things these slides display. So far this just gives you a graph-like structure.<p>The &quot;category laws&quot; ensure coherence of the category and state that (compose(f, id(x)) = f) when defined, (compose(id(x), g) = g) when defined, and that compose is associative. From an abstract algebraic POV this is almost like saying that A is a monoid which ought to (correctly) suggest that most of the interesting structure of a category is carried by the arrows.<p>Now, if you want to talk about specific categories you can do what you were doing. For instance, the category of sets, Set, is the category where you take O to be the proper class of all sets and A to be the functions between them. Immediately, you&#x27;ll find that dom(.)/cod(.) are the domain and codomain of your functions, id(.) locates the identity function on a set, and compose(.,.) composes functions.<p>As a more interesting example you could consider Grp the category where O is all groups and A is all group homomorphisms. This is a subcategory of Set obviously and it also comes with much more interesting structure. For instance, an important category theoretic statement about Grp is that Grp has a &quot;zero object&quot;, which is to say that (a) there exists an object init such that there is a unique arrow from init to any other object, (b) there exists an object fin such that there is a unique arrow from any other object to fin, and (c) init = fin.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_object_%28algebra%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_object_%28algebra%29</a>",1424782352
9100211,comment,9098856,9100036,0,0,alephnil,,,"Rare earth metals are not that rare. Most of them are about as abundant as copper. The problem is their extraction. While copper is present in relative high concentration in sulfide ores that are easy to extract, rare earths are usually present in dilute concentration in many rocks, making it less economical to extract, and is hard to extract even when there is a significant portion of it, leaving behind much toxic chemicals. Furthermore, the rare earths are very similar to each other and often present together, which makes it hard to separate them. In addition, such ores often contain thorium and its decay products, which makes tailings radioactive.<p>The shortage of rare earths has been because it has been uneconomical to extract with any sort of environmental regulation in place. China has almost none of them and has obtained a near monopoly for that reason. Here the &quot;there is no shortage ever&quot; arguments from economists make sense. For helium, the situation is different. The helium that is there is relatively easy to extract (it is a certain percentage in some natural gas fields), but once it is gone it is gone forever.",1424782349

For example, one could create a new secret key, residing in the in the secure would, and specify that it must only be read by code that hashes to a certain hash (running the secure world).<p>So, a Bitcoin wallet, for example, could create a new key in the key store, and -- upon creation of the key -- specify that it can only be read by a piece of ECDSA signature code which hashes to a certain value, and runs in the secure world. So the only thing the wallet can do is send an unsigned Bitcoin transaction to a program running in the secure world, which then parses the transaction, displays the amount and destination address(es) securely on the display (not modifiable by Android running the insecure world), and then the user can accept or deny on the display. Upon accepting, the ECDSA signature code running in the secure world will sign the transaction (inputs), and deliver a signed transaction to the Bitcoin wallet software running in the insecure world.<p>Assuming this small &quot;secure key storage&quot; OS is implemented securely, and protected by a password (with exponentially increasing waiting period after each unsuccessful attempt), it wouldn&#x27;t be possible for software running in Android -- even kernel-level code -- to steal Bitcoin wallet private keys, or any other keys protected by this mechanism. If this key storage OS is kept small enough, it should be possible to create something that can be audited for a reasonable sum of money.<p>Perhaps it could even be written in a language with superior type safety like Haskell, to make it easier to reason about its security.<p>This would be a really big leap in information security -- providing we do it right. It would mean other hardware key storage devices like SIM cards and credit card chips would become less necessary, as secure phone apps would be able to replace these. A VISA card could become an app on a phone, that can securely sign transactions, thus reducing credit card fraud significantly.<p>The secret keys stored on a SIM card could be stored on the phone instead -- using a Diffie-Hellman key exchange between a program running in the secure world and a server run by the cell tower operator. No more receiving SIM cards in the mail.",1424781712

That means the bank will want its customers to trust the signature on the email.<p>Which means that the bank will want the email client to have an appropriate public key to verify the email signature. Regardless of whether we assume the email client is a browser or desktop app, this is where we enter the world of hurt, the world of wasted money.<p>For this to work perfectly, the user has to have one or a small number of public keys installed - otherwise, their email client will quite happily validate signatures from dozens and hundreds of sources - and how will the user, who has no skill or knowledge in this area, know whether or not the <i>right</i> public key is being used for signature validation?<p>To get to the point where the user doesn&#x27;t have to make this decision, the number of public keys installed has to be very low, perhaps one, that is, the bank&#x27;s very own certification authority certificate.<p>What if the user&#x27;s machine is compromised and another certificate installed? After all, there are thousands, hundreds of thousands of Windows machines in zombie botnets, how do we know the bank&#x27;s customers are not among them?<p>Hmm, I guess we need multiple layers of security on those machines.

But only in controlled enterprise environments. In those environments, it works reasonably well. At ongoing expense, sometimes high.<p>Outside those environments, there are simply too many places to inject sufficient doubt so as to invalidate any quantifiable risk assumptions.<p>Which is why email as a consumer service delivery channel is pretty much dead. No control over the consumer endpoint means no assurance that anything there is what it seems.<p>If you cannot control that endpoint, you cannot ask the user at that endpoint to trust you, because you cannot trust that what you sent there is actually what the user sees, nor can you trust that what the user sees is what you sent.",1424781605

On the one hand, I think it does a great job of emphasizing that AI can turn out to be really different from humanity, and may not end up like a &quot;human-in-a-box&quot; like typical popular culture imagines AI. You don&#x27;t get human values for free in any intelligence; the space of all possible minds is huge, and the space of minds that is human-like is very small.<p>However, I think the author fails in truly appreciating just how different an AI could be. I think there&#x27;s a sort of Star Trek style of thinking about other types of intelligence, where aliens are humans except for bumpy foreheads and behavior that is still plausible for some hypothetical human culture. The article&#x27;s emphasis on rights-based Enlightenment-style universalism still makes a lot of assumptions about the similarity of all possible minds.<p>I&#x27;d encourage him to read Eliezer Yudkowsky&#x27;s article &quot;Value is Fragile&quot; ( <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/y3/value_is_fragile/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/y3/value_is_fragile/</a> ) :<p>---<p>>We can&#x27;t relax our grip on the future - let go of the steering wheel - and still end up with anything of value.\n>And those who think we can -<p>>- they&#x27;re trying to be cosmopolitan. I understand that. I read those same science fiction books as a kid: The provincial villains who enslave aliens for the crime of not looking just like humans. The provincial villains who enslave helpless AIs in durance vile on the assumption that silicon can&#x27;t be sentient. And the cosmopolitan heroes who understand that minds don&#x27;t have to be just like us to be embraced as valuable -<p>>You do have values, even when you&#x27;re trying to be &quot;cosmopolitan&quot;, trying to display a properly virtuous appreciation of alien minds. Your values are then faded further into the invisible background - they are less obviously human. Your brain probably won&#x27;t even generate an alternative so awful that it would wake you up, make you say &quot;No! Something went wrong!&quot; even at your most cosmopolitan. E.g. &quot;a nonsentient optimizer absorbs all matter in its future light cone and tiles the universe with paperclips&quot;. You&#x27;ll just imagine strange alien worlds to appreciate.<p>>Trying to be &quot;cosmopolitan&quot; - to be a citizen of the cosmos - just strips off a surface veneer of goals that seem obviously &quot;human&quot;.&quot;<p>---<p>A lot of science fiction isn&#x27;t really about the future or the setting, it&#x27;s about the present and our society. This article is similar in that it&#x27;s less about AI itself -- at least I hope so because if not, then it makes the error of only going halfway on the strangeness of minds that is the whole risk when it comes to AI.",1424781535

I&#x27;ve used Tcl daily for years now, and haven&#x27;t\nexperienced the issues you describe.  I&#x27;ve never had any more difficulty in Tcl\nthan I had in Python finding the error locus based on error output.  On that\nrare occassion that a brace character conflicts with commenting a chunk of\ncode, some simple idioms come to the rescue.  How often do you find yourself\ncommenting out just the first line of a proc definition, not the whole proc?\nEverything-is-a-string is not any more dangerous in Tcl than any other\nlanguage, since the same rule-of-thumb, &quot;don&#x27;t execute untrusted code&quot;, doesn&#x27;t\nrequire any more care than any other language.  It&#x27;s also not inherently slow.\nLook into the the &quot;dual-ported&quot; aspect of the design of Tcl and you&#x27;ll find a\nbrilliant mechanism that provides everything-is-a-string semantics at the\nscript level while using structured representations on the implementation side.<p>Uplevel and upvar are powerful, and call for judicious use.  People complain\nabout the dangerous things that can be done with them.  I find that aspect of\nTcl liberating.  It gives the script author total control, and the script\nauthor is in turn expected to develop the skill to wield the tool.<p>The world seems to have embraced SQLite.  It&#x27;s less well-known that its author\ndesigned it specifically for use with Tcl and is himself a proponent of Tcl.<p>Tcl is so unique that it&#x27;s really difficult to discard all the psychological\nbaggage of other language traditions and catch the zen of it.  But once you get\nin the zone, it&#x27;s a really fun place to be.  It&#x27;s the only language out there\nthat can be anything you want it to be.  Someone recently challenged me to make\nTcl do this:<p><a href=""http://kazimirmajorinc.com/Documents/Crawler-tractor/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kazimirmajorinc.com/Documents/Crawler-tractor/index.h...</a><p>No problem:<p><pre><code>    http://wiki.tcl.tk/40445\n    \n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ve taught both Python and Tcl to kids and teens, and have had had much better\nresults with Tcl.

9100074,comment,9095859,9098358,0,0,nhaehnle,,,"When Intel say they have 52nm wire pitch, this means that they produce wires that are 26nm wide, with 26nm distance between wires. Producing wires that are thinner, or that are closer together, is unreliable.<p>That said, they are probably able to <i>position</i> those wires at a higher precision. Without being involved in the manufacturing myself, I deduce this mainly from looking at optical proximity correction[1], for example, it&#x27;s clear that the final masks used for production have more detail. Another indication is the fact that different masks seem to be aligned to basically nm-level precision (otherwise, the different parts of transistors and the vertical interconnects (vias) between wiring planes would not match up properly). The photographs one sees of the final product also indicate this. This means that the <i>location</i> of wires could theoretically be controlled very precisely, but for a mixture of wavelength and other (chemical? surface tension?) reasons, the <i>size</i> of the wires cannot be made smaller reliably.<p>I&#x27;d be curious to know how precise this alignment really is, and I&#x27;ve never seen numbers for it, but it must be incredibly precise. Given that a large part of it can be done optically, this is not even that surprising, compared to some of the other magic that&#x27;s going on here.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_proximity_correction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_proximity_correction</a>",1424779997

4738467,comment,4736611,4737258,1,0,sageikosa,,,"Well, I certainly didn't call society an oppressive instrument; so I'm not sure how you read that in there.  Society is great, but it is not magical; and if left unattended can be taken over by all sorts of anti-social elements; which is why I stated I have an obligation to make sure it stays just in its dispensation of punishment.<p>""Altruism"" is a cheap emotional fetter; one that very few people want to stand against for fear of being labeled an ogre and demonized by society.  Keeping a low profile in an antagonistic social climate is a valid survival strategy in the short run, which only has to be as long as the social climate prevails; I shrug on how long that will be.<p>So back to charity, charity is not an obligation, and it is not a duty.  It is a possible choice that one can use with ""spare"" (as an individual calculates) resources for ends that he desires to see, or for ""inequities"" (as he sees them) that he desires to erase.  Charity is a payment for values.  If I want to live in a world where I help certain people in certain situation when I want to, that's fine.  If someone else doesn't want to, that's fine too.<p>Society exerted very little in ""granting me"" the life I lead.  I am the beneficiary of the selfish collective action of everyone before me having worked to earn their own living, so if I owe society anything its to continue to work to earn my own living just like my ancestors did; which I consider just.",1351990272

The administration then fixed the problem by removing the duplicate vote and then told everybody how e-voting was a success.<p>Of course, some people complained because a system that allow someone to vote twice doesn't work. The biggest problem though was that they were able to fix it by removing a vote, meaning they could identify the votes and remove it without problems.<p>The bottom line is : from a technical/cryptographical perspective, the system is a joke (and they don't want to give access to the code). And that's my fear with e-voting : it seems like governments agencies (and their contractors) have a tendency to screw up very badly when it comes to new technology, at least in Switzerland.

4738461,comment,4729068,4731567,3,0,wololo,,,"to nitpick:<p>Everett is very controversial, for example:<p><i>Everett (2005) has claimed that the grammar of Pirah is exceptional in displaying 'inexplicable gaps', that these gaps follow from a cultural principle restricting communication to 'immediate experience', and that this principle has 'severe' consequences for work on universal grammar. We argue against each of these claims. Relying on the available documentation and descriptions of the language, especially the rich material in Everett 1986, 1987b, we argue that many of the exceptional grammatical 'gaps' supposedly characteristic of Pirah are misanalyzed by Everett (2005) and are neither gaps nor exceptional among the world's languages. We find no evidence, for example, that Pirah lacks embedded clauses, and in fact find strong syntactic and semantic evidence in favor of their existence in Pirah Likewise, we find no evidence that Pirah lacks quantifiers, as claimed by Everett (2005). Furthermore, most of the actual properties of the Pirah constructions discussed by Everett (for example, the ban on prenominal possessor recursion and the behavior of WH-constructions) are familiar from languages whose speakers lack the cultural restrictions attributed to the Pirah. Finally, following mostly Gonalves (1993, 2000, 2001), we also question some of the empirical claims about Pirah culture advanced by Everett in primary support of the 'immediate experience' restriction. We conclude that there is no evidence from Pirah for the particular causal relation between culture and grammatical structure suggested by Everett.</i> -- Pirah Exceptionality: A Reassessment, <a href=""http://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/3597237"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/3597237</a><p>Pirah actually has two color terms, 'dark' and 'light', which is Stage I in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Color_Terms:_Their_Universality_and_Evolution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Color_Terms:_Their_Univer...</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity_and_the_color_naming_debate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity_and_the_c...</a>",1351990164

On the surface it's all roses - glitzy features coming faster than we can count them, hardware obsoleted with far better options every 6 months, prices falling like crazy ...<p>But you look under the surface.  Apple and Microsoft championing user's ""privacy"" - why? Because they want to attack the revenue base of Google. Don't compete with your competitor.  Poison their environment until it is too toxic for them to survive and they leave.<p>Google releasing ultra cheap phones - why? Apple hugely dependent on enormous margins. Don't compete with them directly. Poison their environment by changing how people think about hardware.  Make it a zero margin game and Apple goes away as simply a side effect.<p>I feel differently about these things on different days. On good days it seems like we're in a golden age of competition. On bad days it seems like we're witnessing a silent armageddon where all sides have abandoned our interests and have voted for mutual-annihilation. ""If I can't win, I'm going to make sure you lose too"" they are saying. I hope my good days are the ones that turn out to be correct.",1351989638

So no, it doesn't rely on new entrants for anything; if people stopped joining tomorrow, or if people stopped mining tomorrow, current participants would still be able to trade with each other and get value out of it.<p>The system is designed so that coins are minted at a steady rate.  There is some additional reward for early adopters in terms of less power required per coin for mining.  But there is also risk for early adopters:  If you're a miner you have to buy real equipment and electricity which costs real dollars today, without a guarantee that you'll be able to liquidate the Bitcoins it produces to recoup your investment (which may take years).

The bank was almost dissolved in 1944 after allegations it facilitated Nazi Germany's looting of other countries assets.  Two of its directors were convicted at the Nuremberg trials and one owned the bank used by the Gestapo.  But the modern father of economics, John Maynard Keynes, was a prominent voice against its dissolution.<p>I believe the very existence of the bank was denied publicly for years.  Today they have assets around $400 billion and are immune from any jurisdiction (based in Basel, Switzerland).  There is nothing American about the Federal Reserve system nor its international counterpart, the BIS.  It's an oligarchy and extremely corrupt.  The reports of the BIS have numbers like ""$147 trillion"" referring to currency swaps etc.  It's a fascinating look at how international banking works, all of which is public now.<p>As for the Liberty Dollar, it existed for around 8-years and had letters from the Treasury, Secret Service and others attesting to its legality.  As soon as Liberty Dollar made millions of dollars in Ron Paul coins, they were indicted and their customer's property was seized.  However, the Liberty Dollar's marketing plans for the promotion of their alternative currency were deceptive and likely illegal.",1351987968

Put some fake screenshots together and tell your potential customers your product is ready and ask them to buy it.

That usually works well.<p>That's what I would do in your place, since you're finding it too hard to code it yourself. In my opinion, why is it bad to ""just hire"" some programmers (instead of giving them/him equity and thus having a co-founder):<p>- Since you don't know how to code, you can't really tell if they're giving you what you paid for (is this shitty code or not?);<p>- Your runway will be a lot shorter since you have to spend money paying them. Also, if you're willing to invest your money in your startup, think about the fact that, for example, with $1000/month you can only hire a lesser programmer but you could pay for a badass server with huge bandwidth, etc;<p>- Startups are also about passion. Hired programmers wouldn't come close to the dedication needed at the early stages of a startup. Unless you were willing to spend a serious amount of cash and hire some seriously good hackers with +- $100k/year;<p>- And theoretically, there's nothing to stop them from ""stealing"" your idea;<p>There you go, my thoughts on the subject.",1351987206

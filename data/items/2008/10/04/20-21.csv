Sure, safe havens are looking good over the past 12 months - but the stock market is going to kill them in the long run.<p>Some people try to time the market, shifting their assets between safe and risky.  However, doing this involves both the labor of research and the risk of being wrong.  You're probably best off in the long term if you just stay with the market.  Unless you want to spend all of your time doing financial research, in which case you can probably increase your std deviation (but not your expected return).",1223153136

323652,comment,323164,323433,0,0,tdavis,,,"I disagree. Better questions for setting goals in ones life are, ""What do you enjoy doing?"" ""What makes you happy?"" ""If you had all the money in the world, what would you do with your time and with the cash?"" These kinds of questions are more valuable because they are applicable to the individual. The question, ""How will you change the world?"" isn't very relevant for a couple reasons:<p>1. What if someone has no interest in changing the world in the grandiose fashion that this question implies? Maybe the thought of saving all the babies in Africa doesn't make everyone feel equally great about their life. Not everyone can be a bleeding-heart humanitarian; society wouldn't function.<p>2. It's really vague. My personal answer to this question is, ""We all change the world every single day simply by living and interacting with others."" Therefor, I'm changing the world 24/7 and there's really nothing more I feel I need to do in terms of something that would have a far-reaching global impact.<p>Life goals should revolve around the core prospect of thoroughly enjoying life. Maybe an immediate goal is ""go to the gym 5 days a week"" and a long-term goal is ""save enough to retire by 45."" If changing the world will help you enjoy life more, then by all means, answer the question to help set goals. However, we should not assume that changing the world is universally something that people want to do.<p>My Dad never wanted to change the world, he just wanted to provide as good a life as possible for his family, make enough money to give his children what they need and (most of) what they want, and that's pretty much it. He didn't ""revolutionize"" anything. He didn't save any babies in Africa. He's just an awesome father and that's enough for him to be a hero to me. Corny? Perhaps, but a good example nonetheless.",1223152441

The only other example of this I can think of, is Max Levchin of Paypal, etc. I don't see a guy with a lemonade truck as being as profitable as Sergey.<p>Another point is, those lemonade trucks will be expenses, and most of the lemonade profits will go to those loan costs. Sergey started off with a low-spend company.",1223152220

But these guys are making it publicly available. I think the test is not whether you make money from it, but whether it takes money away from the patent holder (or potentially does).<p>Yes, most of them appear to be worthless (actually, I think 99%+ of <i>all</i> patents are worthless). The research labs of big technology corps think only some of their work is worth patenting - but I've seen at least one interesting idea there that wasn't in the academic literature...<p>I think a low success rate is true for most research, most startups, most ideas =) ... things involving uncertainty and discovery. But if each play costs $ 000's, I agree it's a game for the rich (or the foolhardy/courageous/overconfident).",1223152138

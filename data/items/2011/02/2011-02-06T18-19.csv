The human radiosphere might technically be 200 light years across, but that doesn't mean a meaningful amount of data could be extracted from it. Yes, we are putting out a steady hum of energy, but it's hardly announcing our presence. Were it not for high energy radar systems deployed on Earth, we could not even detect a civilization down here from any point in our own solar system, much less decipher any of the data being transferred. And as our civilization matures, the amount of energy radiated into space is actually shrinking.<p>That said, 200 light years is an enormous size. Everything that is large enough to take up more than one pixel on the map of our galaxy if freaking huge! People may disagree about the factual relevance of the radio bubble, but it's still immensely cool that we managed to project something this big out there into the world. Looking at this beautiful image of the Milky Way and seeing the unstable little flicker centered on our humble home, I can't help but wonder how many other radiospheres are out there and when they might finally overlap with ours (if they haven't already).",1297017729

2186113,comment,2185429,2185429,0,0,esoteriq,,,"Long-time lurker here - this is one of the first articles that I've felt compelled to respond to. I have a unique perspective on deafness and language.<p>I was born profoundly deaf (so deaf that audiologists proclaimed me as the deafest child ever - what an honor). I learned ASL when I was six months old. To preface - I was incredibly lucky to have parents who learned an entire new language for me (they were immigrants, so it was no easy task for them) and noticed my deafness early. I also got a cochlear implant, which enables me to hear speech fairly well. Over the years, I've learned how to speak and listen well enough to converse with most people. I've also managed to maintain my fluency in ASL - it's a very important part of who I am.<p>According to my mother, I was able to express my desires (I want orange juice, my diapers need changing, etc.) as early as 8 months. So, I was able to talk to my parents at a different level than hearing infants of the same age.<p>I have plenty of deaf friends who were not as lucky. Some of them had hearing losses that were not discovered until they were more than two years old. Some of them just had parents who didn't want to or could not learn ASL. Their performance, academic and otherwise, has lagged behind their hearing peers. I find that their thoughts are not as organized as someone who learned language early on (regardless of form), so some of their actions don't have ""common sense."" Frankly, the benign neglect I see with deaf children is shocking and quite depressing. It makes me grateful for what I had growing up.<p>This article also made me think about how different my thought process is from hearing people's processes. Even after years of using speech as my main mode of communication, ASL still influences my thoughts quite heavily. For example, I tend to think about spatial matters in ASL - i.e. how a street is laid out. Also, I tend to think about emotions in ASL, complete with facial expressions. On the other hand, with more technical issues such as the law (I'm a lawyer), I'll think in words, even spoken words sometimes.<p>In all and all, I'm grateful that I was able to learn ASL so early and transition to spoken language. ASL really enriched my life - culturally and mentally - and I'm very glad that ASL was my first language.",1297017062

While he goes a bit overboard (must be something in the water) his point is an excellent one: visual modeling conveys information at a bandwidth of an order or two of magnitude above conversations or documents.<p>I recently had a functional project. It was a greenfield project and had a MySql backend. I wanted to use dynamic data in some parts and relational in others, fully taking advantage of both FP and the relational model.<p>Problem was, I wasn't sure exactly how I wanted each piece to work. So, I picked up some scrap paper, a pencil, and sketched out some ideas.<p>They sucked.<p>A couple of days later I did it again. This time I saw some things I had been missing.<p>It also sucked.<p>A day after that, I sat down and sketched out what I wanted. Finally.<p>It didn't suck.<p>This entire process took a total of maybe 2 hours spread out over three days. A pencil and scrap paper. Soemtimes I just drew boxes with labels in them, sometimes I added aggregation or composition, sometimes I put in navigation. If I had continued to be stuck, I might have used a sequence diagram, or a collaboration diagram, or any one of a hundred other tools in my UML toolbox.<p>The point is: <i>I never sat down and told myself ""I'm going to be doing UML right now</i>. I didn't get out some big fancy tool, and I didn't make something that looked like the wiring diagram for a nuclear device. That's not how it works. It's a spectrum. Some of my diagrams might have looked like an ER diagram, or just a bunch of junk on paper. Doesn't matter. The process of diagramming served it's purpose of organizing and capturing my thoughts about how the system would be structured. When I needed more complexity, I reached into my UML toolkit and added new complexity. If I didn't need it, I didn't use it. UML worked for me. I didn't work for it.<p>So I don't see UML as even being the same kind of thing as some of the other folks. There's no dual nature at all -- it's just a technical way of drawing pictures.

Source code escrow (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_escrow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_escrow</a>) is something we would often do when I worked for a company that sold ERP software.  The basics of the idea are to give good answers to all the questions you put at the top of your post about what happens if the worst happens.  A source escrow agreement makes it so that if the company you're buying the software from disappears, you at least have access to the source and will have a shot at not being completely screwed.<p>Thing is, though, that the source code license isn't really the thing that you're betting on.  It's your relationship with the vendor.  Your business can be screwed a lot by a business long before the escrow agreement kicks in, and long before they fold.<p>Being heavily dependent on a software company, at least in ERP type business software, is a lot like marriage.  You definitely want to pick the right one, and it's all about the relationship.  If the marriage goes bad, it can make your life hellish, even if you do have a pre-nup.",1297016087

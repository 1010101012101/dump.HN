You're a good writer most of the time, however, I believe you're trying to use a certain style here, and that style may not be appropriate for this type of work if you are aiming at adults and children both; it is appropriate for a children's book though.<p>The patronizing part wasn't the non-programmer part and making fun of programmers. I actually loved the line about VI/Emacs. It was the overly simplified sentences. Let me dig the pdf out:<p><i>You can print things out with print and you can do math. The next step is to learn about variables. In programming
a variable is nothing more than a name for something so you can use the name rather than the something as you code.
Programmers use these variable names to make their code read more like English, and because programmers have a
lousy ability to remember things. If they didn’t use good names for things in their software they’d get lost when they
came back and tried to read their code again.</i><p>For instance in this section your actual sentences are very simple. Over and over you use these simple sentences. And you use an explicit ""you"". It gives the feel of a children's book (I don't know if you have kids, but if not, google for some of the books or ask a co-worker to borrow some). I think explicit ""you"" is fine, but the constant reassurance compounded with the sentence structure and explicit ""you"" feels patronizing.<p>Other examples:<p><i>You might not know it, but every time you put "" (double-quotes) around a piece of text you’ve been
making a string.</i><p><i>Most of these concepts will be exciting once you get them. You’ll struggle with them, like wrestling a squid,
then one day snap you’ll understand it.</i><p>I know several people professionally who'd benefit from the book if you upped the ""implicit respect"" of the style a few notches. However, I'd be afraid to give it to a few of them out of fear of insulting them with the way some people will interpret the tone. I'm putting this out there in all earnestness.<p>Here are a couple books on two different styles which might be more applicable for the work.

The EFF article also notes that the search warrant doesn't state a probable cause for why Chen should have been searched, and why specific materials should be searched in relation to the presumed crime (which they don't actually state). From what I gather, this could make the evidence they gather (if any) inadmissable in court.<p>What's more, since the constitution guarantees freedom of the press if Chen is considered to be a member of the press that would likely make his 4th Amendment protections more stringent.  The article points out that last year the 9th Circuit adopted pretty specific rules about what could be searched and those rules will likely have to be followed.<p>Even if Chen committed a crime I think that this was indeed an over-reaction.  The use of a broad search warrant could make all evidence gathered inadmissable in court and turn this into a circus of finger-pointing.",1272401692

May be. Is that what you are aiming for ?<p>""We'd love to hear a solution that makes people using their real name without using Facebook Connect."" That is a hard problem , more incidental complexity than anything else.<p>Edit: edited for grammar.",1272398486

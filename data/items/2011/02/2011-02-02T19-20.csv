People want to instantly become wealthy, famous, and desirable with zero effort. They want to believe that someone (anyone) can provide these things, and they're willing to pay money on the off-chance they're able to deliver. They want to be associated with someone who travels around the world, hangs out with famous people all day, and seemingly succeeds in everything.<p>Ferriss promises people exactly what they want, so they buy. Simple as that.<p>The operative question for all of us on HN: what Ferriss does clearly works. Do you choose to emulate him? Why or why not?",1296676729

While it's vivid, it might be a tiny side-effect only notable in contrived cases.<p>Overall, this kind of URL-after-URL signal, extracted from every participating user, and every trail through both search sites and non-search sites, might be discovering valuable terms-in-preceding-URL-to-later-visited-URL associations. These associations might result in many search improvements, other than the one-for-one result porting Google's experiment has found. We don't really know the relative magnitude of porting-results versus other-benefits, yet I think that's important to the analysis.<p>If a useful automated or user-driven process generates a little indirect infringement around the edges, is that enough to demand the process be stopped entirely? Note, that's not the standard Google wants applied to user uploads to YouTube, or excerpting of news and websites onto Google services. Google says: ""defend yourself, by adding opt-outs (robots.txt) or sending takedown notices, and we'll undo the incidental infringements eventually"".",1296676536

2171612,story,,,4,4,bcrawl,"Ask HN: How would you monetize this info? ",,"Short Version: I have access to long list of food product information from major manufacturers. This includes pictures, nutritional info and ingredients of food products and also common household items. I failed to monetize the info.<p>Long Version:<p>There is a company which collects manufacturers product information of grocery products. So they have images, nutritional info, ingredients of around 85,000 products of food and housing supplies from major manufacturers. There are other companies which collect similar info but I am just not aware of them yet. I approached the company and they agreed to provide me a daily xml feed of their product list for a set up fee and monthly charge.<p>With the data in hand, I started skimming major websites/businesses which used this information. 2 types of business models stood out the most. One was sites using the nutritional info and ingredients list to categorize products by healthy choices, forming a community which discussed healthy eatings and recipes. Second was by grocery chains such as safeway, hyvee, amazon [fresh or the new spinoff] etc. They used this information in their ecommerce application [though there is a stark difference in how some of them fundamentally operate. Such as peapod is a site where one can get groceries delivered but peapod doesnt own any stores and they work with local stores, where as FreshDirect is a webvan style grocery delivery done right]. Either way, all big grocery chains had online delivery section where one can browse products and promos, interact such as create shopping lists, place orders etc.<p>I am from midwest. Unlike most east/west coast states, midwest states are spread out. In some cases people usually travel to nearby towns to do their shopping, such as Homedepot, Walmart, Target, Bestbuy. There is also a healthy ecosystem of independent grocery distributors and stores which thrive. Distributor usually also has their own private label produts which are knock offs of the original with higher margins and stores are independently owned and are sucessfull in serving a decent size community. They usually have 10-30 employees with no IT department per se. Picture an IT guy who usually maintains the hardware and back end software stuff including updating retails. So his job is already full. And so no way they can set up an eCommerce site and maintain it.<p>My idea was to build a service surrounding B2B Ecommerce application aimed at independently owned [mom-and-pop] grocery stores. Of the 85,000 products info I have, my estimate is that I will match atleast 50% of their products and the remaining will be either manufacturers my source doesnt carry or private labels. I will set them up and maintain their site with actual product listings on their behalf with latest retails, just like their big chain counterparts and they pay me a modest monthly fee for the service. And as we know about more sources of info we will add more products. There are hundreds of grocery stores which fit this profile.<p>At this point I commited the cardinal sin of investing time and energy and money into worrying about the right framework for the job and programmer, instead of right sales person to work with. I wanted to have concrete answers on how we will build it so I started researching into open source frameworks which I could use and I picked a Java based web erp application which fit the requirements neatly. It let me set up web based ecommerce applications with full customization capabilities for each site all from a central backend. I then approached a freelancer, hired him to set up the company site, a demo site, work in the backend to start customizing the business logic etc. Once the work started and it seemed like it was dooable,I hopped on hoovers.com and researched all stores with revenue greater than million dollars which are independently owned and obtained a list of 100 stores in my state. I then approached a customer who seemed interested, but was extremely skeptical. Since I had no prior experience with any other customer and this is my first attempt at a startup, I offered to do this for free and if he likes the product he could pay. I was so desperate that I agreed to do this with out even signing a contract which he verbally agreed.<p>I then signed the contract with our source and we started working on importing the data into our system. Fast forward to today, the customer I talked to is not that interested anymore. He is concerned that we will not be putting his private label products online which are his major profit makers. But since I dont have access to that info nor do I know of anyone, I asked him if he could recommend me to someone who can obtain this data. That is where I am. He is putting me off saying that he is working with his distributor to obtain the info I need while we are working aimlessly. I have already shared my product list with him but he hasnt given me his. I have offered to help him extract the info if needed to analyze his data but he is just too uncomfortable sharing his list I guess. I read some where that beaware of your first customer and he is the direct incarnation of the worst first customer ever.<p>Finally, there is still a 1-1.5 months work left and I would need to another 3-4K of programming and server expenses to set at least one customer/store up and _hopefully_ be ramen profitable. I dont feel like approaching other potential customers since I dont know if I can get it done. I am completely broke because of unforseen expenses in Jan.  I currently am unemployed and have been for more than 6 months. Because of personal reasons I was stuck in the same small town with no real job openings. Friends and family support long dried up. Personal credit has always been bad. I dont want to go the route of shopwell.com or zeer.com where a community is built around product information because of uncertainity reasons. Ecommerce service seemed a viable business model but I would need a finished product before I can sell to customers.<p>I have no partners and bootstrapped my way so far. I have a reasonable friend who listened to my story and asked me to drop the project and accept loses. He offered me a place in TN and promised me that he will try his best to find me a decent job to get back on life. That would mean that I would have to leave everything I worked and invested and start afresh since I will be back in corporate job.<p>So,I am looking for answers on,
- What would you have done to monetize such data?
- How would you have done different if you were me?
- What would you do if were me? [based on the info and financial situation I am in]<p>Thanks a lot for reading guys.",1296674157

I often have a lot of jittering, esp. when doing some CPU/IO intensive work in the background but also without. Sometimes when I play from a Samba share, it may also because of slow connection, whereby the connection should be fast enough to play it in real-time without a problem. I already played a lot around with settings like skipping frames, cache size, etc. but I never really got it removed completely. And the UI, esp. controls like play/pause, also feel a bit laggy. E.g., when I hit pause, it still plays for about half a second.<p>MPlayer is among the fastest players I know. One good sign of that is that I can normally play Xvid/H264 videos with it on my 350MHz PII with an onboard graphics card (Riva128) in Xorg without any problem. And on my normal PC, it never has any performance problems, no matter what I do in the background. And it also responds really fast. When I hit pause, it instantly pauses.<p>Only problem with MPlayer: It often does not integrate that well, at least on MacOSX (maybe most of this is Mac related). And there are no real official binaries and the ones which exists are outdated. Also, all of the available GUIs often have further problems and make the performance a lot worse (which I don't really understand).<p>Anyway, why I am writing this: Often enough, I have thought about that the VLC GUI and OS integration (also including automatic updates, etc.), with MPlayer as the engine, would be the best thing.",1296673921

The company was legit and the siezure happened in the middle of a transaction with them. (EG: I'd paid, they had gotten the goods, but hadn't mailed them out yet.)<p>Anyway, the warrant said stuff like this:
Under Article Blah, doing Activity Y is made a felony. Entity Blah located at Blah Blah, has bank accounts Blah, blah, blah and employees blah, blah, blah, blah and blah.<p>Therefore, we propose to seize all computers, phones, office furniture, rugs, ceiling tiles, and especially all property of value from blah.<p>Nowhere in the warrant was any probable cause presented indicating the company was actually engaging in ""Activity Y"".<p>Further, since a member of the government- a PR spokesperson, not a layer, had previously accused the company of engaging in Activity Y, the company had taken them to court, in order to get a retraction of the claim and admission that the company was not engaging in Activity Y.<p>The judge who signed the seizure warrant, that allowed the federal government to seize all of the property of this company <i>was the very same judge</i> who was hearing the federal case, and thus had in his possession proof that the company was not engaging in Activity Y.<p>And still he signed the warrant.  The companies assets were seized, still years on no charges have been filed, and of course the assets were sold and the FBI pocketed the money.<p>The corrosiveness is that judges, in my example one who knew for a fact that the company was not engaging in the criminal actively alleged, are signing seizure orders based on warrants that don't provide probable cause or any evidence of actual criminal activity.<p>Never mind that there is no provision in the constitution for the US federal government to shut down websites, and there is a prohibition of making any law that would allow them to do so.",1296673385

Likewise you could ask of a widow to wear black for a year, and if she wouldn't, you could start gossiping and badmouthing her.<p>Also, there are more and more people who go through HN. Perhaps eventually the bar has to be black all the time because somebody always dies.",1358013492
5048351,comment,5046845,5047386,1,0,evgenit,,,"> This is rational. It, for me, is not a label like ""depression"". It a conclusion based on my observation and experience.<p>Our rational minds are not somehow separate from our emotions and brain chemistry, though. Beware rational conclusions that have feelings attached, and that make you feel positive affect. And if it's only rational for <i>you</i>, well then that's a statement about your mind (brain), not the world or anything else.<p>I am also puzzled by this: 
>  Oh yeah, be drugged up. That solves it all. Well, it might for people with things like chemical imbalances<p>How would you know whether or not you have one (chemical imbalance isn't correct, but how do you know what your brain chemistry looks like?) And rational conclusions tend not to magically go away due to drugs unless it's drugs that make you seriously impaired in general (which you would notice). And SSRIs don't ""put thinkers to sleep"", go do some research, and note the thinkers that have been on them for large-ish parts of their careers/productive years.<p>Finally, have you been checked for common physical illnesses that can cause depression? Off the top of my head, vitamin deficiency is  famous for this. Read about people with brain tumours and damage, too, and note how these things can have effects on feelings and whatnot without being noticeable by the person having them.",1358013482

I guess it's one of the differences in the ""psy"" area between the US and Europe where psychoanalysis is more widespread.<p>I've also known some deep depressive years (after my mother committed suicide). The cure has been to read ( Nietzsche mainly), to embrace it, to listen to my brain, to little by little understand it. Understanding that depression is a pure symptom of our humanity : it's the moment you loose meaning in your life ( as Nietzsche says, the Human being is the only animal who needs meaning to live ). And then, you realize that the meaning of your life can only come from one source : yourself. We are easily trap by the need of approval, the need of existence within the eyes of the one who surrounds us. These approvals do not exist and are only projected, forecasted, approvals, it's our own devils. We are free to put whatever meaning we desire on our lives, as long as we respect others. Life is a permanent challenge to ourselves. This is the reason this is the most beautiful journey... Life is short anyway, let's make it a beautiful adventure. There is nothing to lose, everything to gain.",1358013457

I'm among the biggest Java fans, so my disappointment is acute.<p>#1 - Netscape. Their Java support always sucked. Broken thread implementation. The joke was write once debug everywhere. The early troubles soured most and Sun lost the precious mindshare. Relying on a third party for the success of Java was a huge mistake.<p>#2 - Sun killed their HotJava web browser, written in Java. It was the ideal applet platform. Ran great. Had a great UI for the time. Imagine if they'd kept that going.<p>#3 - Sun waited until Java 6, a full decade, to revamp their Java plugin. Way too late to make a difference.<p>#4 - AWT controls looked terrible, were too minimal. But Swing was just too heavy. The design was great for time, being the logical successor to NextStep -> Cocoa -> Netscape IFC development line. But Sun never put it on a diet, either the API or the payload.<p>(Thanks for the floating point parse bug tip. Writing a web server using Netty, that's a good one to know.)",1358012931

The most egregious offense I keep seeing is how selfish suicide is.<p>That, to me, is a very intimate and personal thing to say. That's something he shares with him, his family, and close friends.<p>But my conclusion is this... emotional guilt tripping someone to say their suicide creates pain for others thereby he should never choose to commit suicide doesn't perpetuate healthy growth.<p>Moreover I think it's interesting as to how a community responds. The first thing people are doing is to find a solution, to problem solve depression which has many variables, vectors, causes, and results.<p>I believe this is our challenge oriented engineering brain at work.

There are some who manage to hang on to another current and make headway towards warmer climates, there are some who do not. The world is now saddened to learn that you were caught up in the harsh artic cold of life. We could ask questions as to why did you not swim harder or faster, but none of us were in your place.<p>Your short life was anything but worthy of such tragic end. You decided to leave too early, too soon. Still, your presence still lives through your work, the community you helped build, and the people you touched.<p>Farewell.",1358010615

We've been using Stripe, but the business has been paying the contractors using their bank's ACH service add-on which takes 3-5 days and has to be done manually.<p>Balanced seems like it's Stripe + next-day ACH payouts, which would automate everything. Is this an accurate description of the service? I'm confused why you'd ever use Stripe over Balanced in that case. This is assuming it's also a merchant account + payment gateway like Stripe if I'm reading correctly.<p>Still wrapping my head around how to best make this work.",1358010569

Why is anybody bothered by it?<p>I'm an American and have used plenty of (European) websites and product manuals where English is identified by a British flag. I have no problem with that. And plenty of (American) websites and product manuals where English is identified by an American flag. Which makes sense to me. Why is that such a problem to you?<p>It's true that languages are not countries, but languages almost always <i>do</i> exist in country-specific versions. British English is not American English. Brazilian Portuguese is not Portuguese from Portugal. Spanish in Mexico is different from Spanish in Argentina.<p>Is doesn't seem that unreasonable to use the flag of the country-specific version of the language being translated. If you're doing Spanish, you have to choose <i>which</i> Spanish in the first place anyways. The Portuguese can deal with a Brazilian flag if they hired a Brazilian translator. And for super-huge sites, you'll probably have different sections for USA and Britain <i>anyways</i>, since they'll have different pricing, different products, etc.",1358010545

Two days after the last show, the author jumped out of a window in his grandmother's apartment.<p>It baffled everyone around him, but I think the reason is that success didn't bring him the joy he thought it would bring.

Most rappers would like to rhyme the ends of their sentences.  I know sometimes they don&#x27;t (like poetry), but it&#x27;s certainly pleasing to the ear to have that constraint.  Artists endeavour to make their songs catchy, that&#x27;s highly correlated with the gross sales of the product.<p>When an artist writes a novel, this constraint is not weighted quite as highly.  I know Shakespeare wrote poetry, too, and to call me out on this comparison is entirely fair.  That said, there&#x27;s also an argument to be made for eye rhymes.  Shakespeare used these a lot.  Eye rhymes are words that don&#x27;t rhyme aurally, but <i>do</i> rhyme visually.  It&#x27;s the story that pleases the reader, not necessarily its aural &#x27;catchiness&#x27;.  I probably made that word up.  But Shakespeare made words up too.  The point is, you knew what I meant.<p>At the end of the day these comparisons, while certainly <i>interesting</i>, should be taken with a pinch of salt.  While I&#x27;m at it, this advice can easily be extrapolated to any dataset.  Always understand there may be unknown correlations.",1399225815

Easybacklog provides tools to compare the backlog at points in time and thus renegotiate at each sprint with the client in regards to scope or price.<p>I have thousands of active users and have asked many of them whether they would be willing to pay, and they are.

Usually in web the in-between time of request and response is the time it takes for your application to do the work. However, if you plan to do a lot of work (e.g. render business reports), or the work can take quite long (e.g. make a request to an external service), asynchronous processes make a lot of sense. The request will return the response fast and the application registers a &quot;task&quot; in the queue. A queue system will then pop one of the tasks independent of the web request/response cycle and process the tasks in it&#x27;s own time.<p>In short, it simply makes your application respond faster (and scale better) while you still can keep track of all the work done.<p>I am quite familiar with gearman and beanstalkd, but Celery (as far as I understand it) is a python layer over these implementations.

Some sites will have &quot;id=234234234&quot;, some sites will have complicated paths, some sites will have nice, readable URL&#x27;s, and a large part of the difference is the specific framework or approach that the Web Devs decided to use. Do you really think it&#x27;s important for people to understand the decisions behind this? That&#x27;s over the line IMO.<p>Also, another knock against URL&#x27;s being required is that, <i>de facto</i>, people don&#x27;t understand URL&#x27;s and seem to use the web just fine. That&#x27;s because us selfless developers have been working hard to abstract away the issue from users. I think most users <i>don&#x27;t</i> understand URL&#x27;s, and this doesn&#x27;t bother them in the least until you get to issues like phishing attacks. So all Chrome would be doing is <i>recognizing an existing situation</i>, and helping make it better.<p>Lastly, I&#x27;d like to point out that even the easy examples you mention, e.g. passwords, are something that most users <i>don&#x27;t really understand</i>, and for exactly that reason, developers have been trying to get rid of passwords for many years. And IMO, one of the big benefits of Facebook is that it makes the &quot;send a message to someone&quot; game <i>much easier than email</i> for real users, so that&#x27;s a knock against email.<p>I really <i>don&#x27;t</i> think that understanding URL&#x27;s is akin to being basically literate. I think the bar is much lower, and that we as developers forget just how much specialized knowledge we already know, and how much the average user <i>already has</i> in order to use a computer these days.<p>That said, it&#x27;s a great analogy so thanks for bringing it up!",1399224050

7694911,comment,7693954,7693954,2,0,Theodores,,,"The best mentors do not set out to be mentors or see themselves as (primarily) mentors. Yet they push you, mentor you and won&#x27;t let you go. Because of this it is not so easy to get someone to &#x27;be your mentor&#x27; in a formal sense, or, if that situation arises, where someone has agreed to be your mentor, then it is not necessarily the real deal.<p>As others have said the mentorship arrangement only transpires over time, and on reflection. However it is something that you can find within days of working with someone, possibly even within minutes.<p>I believe some people are more prone to finding mentors than others. Think of school and the vast overwhelming majority of pupils that the teachers really could not care a great deal about. Then there are the chosen few, singled out for special treatment. A &#x27;C&#x27; might be good enough for the normal demands of the course, however, for those &#x27;mentor worthy few&#x27; it is not quite like that. Even if they do not care whether they pass of fail, for whatever special reason it is, teachers will not let them be like that. Consequently they get mentored whether they like it or not.<p>It is the same in the workplace, there are a lot of also-ran&#x27;s. Someone who has to just pick up the phone and be in on time is not likely to be pushed to excel or develop. Others don&#x27;t get to be left alone like that. This is a different pressure to &#x27;must work harder and be more productive&#x27;, more care is involved, whether desired or not. I don&#x27;t think even intellect has much bearing on the deal, you don&#x27;t have to be gifted for someone to pick you out for mentoring and there are plenty of very smart, intelligent people that just do not pick up mentors.<p>Outside of academia and learning for the sake of learning, one great pressure for &#x27;successful mentoring situations&#x27; is where time is money and the job just has to be done for a paying customer. If you can help with that you can find yourself a most useful mentor along the way. Also, if there is a strategic need for some knowledge to be shared then that can help. If you are the only one willing to learn all the systems and do weekend call outs when things go wrong, there is a lot of incentive for others to get you fully up to speed.<p>I should also say that in mentoring situations, cock-ups are allowed. You can ask for help on a particular thing or break a particular thing three times and three times only. A fourth time and you are renegading on the deal.",1399222837

It&#x27;s generally used negatively to imply that there is an emptiness and a selfishness driving the actor which I tend to dispute.<p>I think that your second definition is both easy to support and reduced beyond usefulness. If one experiences pleasure from pain (BDSM, piercing, tattoos, or as you mentioned sacrifice) then there is no paradox, no need to ignore these situations and no need for an alternate, even more vague definition.",1399222813

And who could complain more about the Power History graph (<a href=""http://twitpic.com/5odjg/full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitpic.com/5odjg/full</a>)<p>I wonder if there is a way to make such people aware that what they're are going gaga over is already implemented and what is made there is something insignificant to be included in any repo. That's why maybe this little overdo is getting hosted on Microsoft's open source initiative/crap - codeplex",1242971951

621645,comment,621442,621442,0,0,JimmyL,,,"I interned at a large company - there's a good chance you have one of their products in your pocket right now - a few summers ago, and a had a really great experience. I ended up being able to do much more than my initial position promised, and the other members of my team were all about mentoring and helping me grow. Like many things we do, it's somewhat of a crapshoot - but if you work hard, act like you're a full-time employee (and demand to be treated like one), and contribute, you should hopefully end up with a good experience.<p>Something to look out for is also the number of interns that the company has; I would say that more is better. Not only will you have a peer group of fellow young ambitious people to network with, but if there's a large intern population then it's likely that the company has spent some time and effort devising programs for internship mentors, giving them time to do that in their plans, etc. - whereas if they're not used to having interns, they may just throw you at shitty work and hope you figure things out and be the squeaky wheel as needed.<p>Also +1 to wmf about connections. If you have a successful internship (and this is especially the case with large companies), you're very likely to be offered a position to come back when you graduate, or at least have a serious leg up on the competition. They know you, you're trained in company procedures, and you're in the system already, so it's cheaper to hire and on-board you as opposed to some random they picked up. Even if you don't want to, you'll make some good connections to the managers in your area (as well as others, if you make an effort) who will provide valuable references for future employment, as well as networking jump-off points.",1242971605

621628,comment,621165,621165,0,0,madair,,,"I suggest a new meme: Showing banned content on iPhones and blogging photos of the iPhone showing it loud and clear. Or something like that. I mean, come on, is that what they are afraid of?!??<p>Note the difference between Apple and Craigslist. Craigslist goes out on a limb based on their strongly stated belief structure; Apple actively fights those very same principles, preferring that nothing muck with the pristine image.<p>I think you know which CEO I want in a foxhole with me. Hell, I think Craig should run for public office.<p>Back to the problem at hand, it seems everyone and their brother wants to print cash through some new walled garden, and the apologists will trot out the familiar stinky logic, things like, ""well they've got a lot of buyers don't they, how could THAT be wrong?!?""<p>But the computer industry grew with tinkering, hell it grew with HACKING, and even that old devil of a heel, Microsoft, had a big part in the growth of open hardware systems. Don't bother to trot out the exceptions, there will always be exceptions, but big picture is the PC exists and is the mad playground today that it was the instant IBM flew with MS-DOS way back when.<p>Sure the iPhone is a great design, sure the Mac has their beautiful craftmanship. But they are as closed systems as Apple can conceivably get away with, and the fan boys and girls who are also hackers are letting us all down by trying to drown out the calls for more openness. Let's call a spade a spade: the hardware engineering is cool, but the wall-in garden attitude sucks like hell and is harmful to hackers, to consumer, to freedom-lovers of all stripes.<p>You can't argue with profits...unless you think that there are things more important than money.",1242969637

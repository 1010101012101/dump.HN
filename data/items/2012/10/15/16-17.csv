4655948,comment,4655235,4655692,3,0,fafner,,,"I guess the biggest problem is that Facebook is now the place where everything comes together. You suddenly end up having your boss, parents, coworkers as friend along with the guy you used to do drugs with during your teen years and that trashy ex-girlfriend. And it's not easy to keep those things apart with the real name policy facebook has. It's also not easy to reject a lot of friend requests. Sure somebody you haven't seen in ages you can easily ignore but with coworkers it can get unpleasant. I'm glad that my parents are too old for facebook but for a lot of especially young people rejecting a parents' friend request is probably impossible as well.<p>Sure you can try to have different profiles. But they easily spill over. And facebook collects a lot of data. The worst thing are probably the phone and address books of your friends. Someone has stored your email address or phone number associated with your real name on his phone and installs the facebook app and suddenly they now. Or people are stupid enough to give facebook access to their email account. They even started to ask friends of you what your real name is.<p>I recently had to delete my account because they realised I was using a fake name. I don't know if somebody ""squealed on me"" or they got the information elsewhere.<p>In the past your online identities were easily separated because everything was in a different place and it was easier to be anonymous. You could have several IM profiles for friends and family separated. With other people you'd only communicate through one of your many email addresses.",1350320359

4655946,comment,4655184,4655645,1,0,martinced,,,"It's better than that: several quality keyboards do not even come with a CAPS LOCK key anymore.<p>For example if you're into quality switches, rated for 50 millions keypresses and providing a better tactile feedback than the typical $5 chinese mass-produced keyboard, you may want to shell out $250 to buy an Happy Hacking Pro 2 or a Realforce keyboard using Topre switches (you can have very good Cherry MX based boards for way less than that that said).<p>Some of these keyboards, like the HHKB Pro 2, don't even have Caps Lock.  They have Control in place of Caps Lock.<p>So ""Do people really not use caps lock?"" is not the correct question.  The correct question is: ""Do programmers who touch-type and who spent time figuring out which keyboard switch they like really not use caps lock?"" and then the answers becomes ""yeah, most really don't use caps lock because Ctrl is so much more useful and so easier to use when it's located where caps lock typically is.  To the point that companies building $$$ keyboard for that market don't even bother selling keyboard with caps lock"" : )<p>""CLOCKS_PER_SEC"" should be ""CLO"" and then auto-complete anyway.  Regarding NSString, that's keypress, keyrelease (turning capslock on), 'n' 's' 's', keypress, keyrelease (turning capslock off).   Doing it without capslock is keypress (shift), 'n' 's' 's', keyrelease.  Which IMHO is faster but YMMV.<p>People touch-typing are alternating Shifts when needed when typing all-caps or typing lowercase and uppercasing the whole word using some vi(m)/emacs magic shortcut anyway ; )",1350320344

I've never joined, and never seen the attraction myself. It hasn't affected my professionally or personally, I think one person has asked about it (an old school friend). I do think the use of the word suicide here is hyperbole. Surely you don't actually pursue serious academic work through FB?<p>Personally I think <i>taking part</i> in Facebook intensively could lead to problems later in your social/work life, when all the data for decades of your personal and work life and that of all your friends is available for data-mining by anyone willing to pay for it. The same applies to other social networks of course if you use them frequently, but FB has the illusion of privacy which the others don't.",1350320320

It's my understanding that the intent (and legal TOS) of the code was ""limit 1 per customer. Non-transferrable."" The fact that the server allowed it doesn't change the fact that the intent was for it to be used once.<p>Imagine a bowl of candy out during Halloween. There is a sign that says ""Take only one"". The fact that this house failed to implement a means of controlling how many people take doesn't make it OK to take two handfuls.<p>The important distinction in this case is what the legal language of acceptable use was, and not what was possible through the (broken) server. If you fail to print ""limit one per customer"" on your coupons, that's a lesson learned. If you DO print ""limit one per customer"" but fail to validate that at the self-checkout lane, and people abuse it, that's fraud.<p>*This all predicates on whether the actual language stipulates that the code really is only good for a single, non-transferrable use.",1350320187

The domain expertise is incorporated in this step, as well as in putting the competition results to use in production.<p>This splits the ""domain expertise"" and ""predictive modeling"" components into two separate chunks. While domain expertise is crucial for asking the right questions, we've found that it isn't as necessary for the predictive modeling component. For example, in the essay scoring contest we hosted, none of the winners had touched natural language processing prior to the contest. However, they beat out many experts with decades of experience in NLP.<p>For an internal data science team, the ""domain expertise"" component is at least as important, as they are charged with asking the right questions as well.

4655882,comment,4653370,4653370,2,0,tryitnow,,,"This article displays a rather poor understanding of free speech.<p>First, it sets up a false dichotomy between an idealized ""free speech"" past and a present where free speech is in danger.  Where's the evidence for this?  The US has always had an uneasy relationship with ""free speech.""  I don't believe that the First Amendment was ever interpreted as liberally as this author seems to think.<p>Any article talking about free speech's decline in the US should refer to the two key Supreme Court cases:\nSchenck v. United States and Brandenburg v. Ohio.  Seriously, it takes like less than 5 minutes to look these up on wikipedia and you can already see that the First Amendment has always been interpreted pretty conservatively.\nFacts are our friends, I wish this author would have provided some citations and historical context.<p>As for countries other than the US?  Are you kidding me?  Europe has always had restrictions even on political speech.  There's no limiting of free speech that is new here.  Sure the author cites some ""new"" laws but these laws reflect the spirit of the old laws.  No news here people.<p>Now I'll address the author's subcategories where he believe free speech is being eroded:<p>Blasphemy: This is the only area in the article where the author has a bit of a point.  The presence of relatively large populations willing to riot over perceived insults to their religion (i.e. Muslims) is sort of new in Western Europe and leaders are figuring out how to deal with it.  However, I don't see anybody rushing out to ban the Satanic Verses.  Most leaders are concerned about people doing silly things like dressing up as zombie Muhammed in public.  A key criterion here is the possibility of inciting public violence.  Rarely do works of literary or artistic merit have this effect, so restrictions are mostly directed towards people doing insulting things in public.  Think of going into a bar and insulting the biggest, dumbest looking guy there.  Yes, you should have the right to do that, but ask any prosecutor how much sympathy a judge is going to have for your case.  There's nothing new here.  Personally, I wish our laws allowed more expressions of insulting speech.  I actually agree with the author on that point - but the author undermines his case by pretending that we're somehow backsliding.  We're not, this has always been the standard.<p>BTW, I write this as an atheist who plenty of Muslims would love to see butchered.  However, we need to remember that much of the censorship going on around this issue is self-censorship.  The state censorship he cites is really nothing new - in France it's just an extension of how they deal with Nazis and others.  I disagree with French laws on this, but again, there's nothing new here.  The author is being alarmist.<p>Hate crimes\nThe reason for hate crime laws is that a hate crime is more than just a crime between two people. It's something that has the potential to incite group versus group violence.  There's a qualitative difference in an act that's meant to intimidate a a single individual and one meant to intimidate a specific group.  When acts directed specifically at a group are committed everyone in that group feels a bit of the effect of the act, hence the punishment should be greater.  Additionally, there are some hate criminals who don't mind getting punished just for committing an act against an individual because their real goal is intimidating an entire group.<p>Speech is discriminatory\nUmmm, discrimination on the basis of suspect and quasi-suspect categories has been illegal in many circumstances for some time now.  Putting up a sign that says ""Coloreds not welcome"" at your establishment is pretty much illegal and has been even though it's a restriction on ""speech.""  This is based on the fact that you're operating a public establishment and therefore derive gains from being part of the broader society.  With those gains come responsibilities.  If you and your buddies don't want to hang around blacks when you BBQ in your backyard you're still free to discriminate because you're not running a public establishment in that context.  The example cited in the article comes from a comedy club, a public establishment.  Again, nothing new here.<p>Speech is Deceitful\nIf you lie and get a benefit from it, then yes, you should be prosecuted.  I don't know why the author views this as a problem.  The example he cites from France is not an outlier in French history - it's an extension of France's rather stringent anti-hate laws.  Laws I disagree with just like the author does, but again, there's nothing new here.<p>One of the reasons I really don't like this article is because I kind of agree with the author around loosening free speech standards, but he just does an awful and alarmist job of conveying his point.  He is bound to turn off anyone who has any grasp of the history and nuance around the subject.  I feel like a cause I support has been set back by this author's very poor argumentation skills.<p>This article reminds us that opinion column writers were the original trolls long before the Internet ever existed.<p>tl:dr: The author does not provide any convincing evidence that the ""West is limiting Free Speech"" in any new way.",1350319649

There's a huge discussion about whether or not the user's browser is within scope for PCI-- this is what systems like Stripe and Braintree are gambling on, that the browser _isn't_ within scope (Braintree actually makes this a big selling point; if you use their system, your platform is no longer in scope for PCI-DSS).<p>The PAN data -- the cookie -- is encrypted in transit, and if it's encrypted at every point in Santander's network then technically they could be compliant to the letter of the rules.

But if the browser simply isn't treating the token as secret data, then it gets around -- addons might send queries out to a server for various contextual features, Google may collect it (to help live search dropdowns), etc. -- it's simply not treated as carefully, so it gets out.<p>Of course, production uses (vs. developers wandering around) generally wouldn't even be using a browser (and I could personally make sure these params weren't in our logs), so none of this is disastrous; just issues on my mind.",1350318608

I had in mind something along the lines of media piracy, except in EA's case there is an actual cost (since their bandwidth provided the content, and their servers will have to support it when they go online). I think the majority of people accept the fact that piracy is ethically wrong, even if there is no cost to the producer. When you pirate, you are enjoying content that someone else produced with their finances, time, and talents. The social contract is that in return for that enjoyment, you support the content producer by purchasing a licensed copy so they can be rewarded for their efforts. When you pirate, you deprive the producer of that reward.<p>The same deprivation occurs here.

And evented programming seems to get a bad reputation in some circles as an ""over-hyped"" paradigm. But it's cases like this where the difference becomes truly clear. A developer making a native extension for an evented architecture is <i>forced</i> to make every operation nonblocking, while consistent lock release is much more of an optional optimization for a blocking architecture. Sure, you can get equally good performance with a blocking architecture, and slightly easier syntax, but for many of the native extensions you might use, it's very possible that the authors didn't think to do this type of analysis, or even know about rb_thread_blocking_region and its ilk. So naive implementations may be wasting threads exactly like this example.

You can't assume that this wasn't EA's intent, (although it's almost certain it wasn't).  Ultimately, the onus is on EA to make their system work right.<p>I'm not arguing that people who abused the code weren't doing something wrong, but it is not cut-and-dried.  However, I definitely disagree with the idea that they were ""stealing"".<p>I think a better analogy is when a business accidentally advertises a product at the wrong price.  They are required by law to honor the advertisement even if it was a mistake.  This is much closer to the situation with EA than the idea that they ""left their front door unlocked"", etc.  Regardless of other circumstances, the transaction was legal, and I think the law might well require EA to honor it... but I don't know the details.<p>Another analogy would be issuing a coupon and forgetting to include ""limit 1 per customer"", or even having a salesperson giving out free product, who misunderstands and doesn't limit the product to one per customer.<p>Would customers in those cases be considered ""stealing"" if they took advantaqe of these situations?  I don't see how that can be argued.  Could they be accused of being greedy?  Definitely, but as much as people might wish otherwise, being greedy isn't against the law.<p>FWIW, I didn't use this code, and wouldn't have exploited it even if I had.

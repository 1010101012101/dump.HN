It's actually a long story about what started me down that path (dealing with health issues), but I've actually put back on some weight (around 40 pounds...it's easy to be blind to oneself :().<p>What I've found is that when I start eating carb-rich food, my ability to stop snacking on carb-rich foods goes to zero. So I've cycled between maintaining where I eat a low-glycemic diet and not doing that and gaining. When I spoke of ""biological imperative"", I mean me: when I eat carbs, I can't stop. I <i>never</i> get full. I'm sure I'd be a Type 2 diabetic in about 5 years if I didn't make this change.<p>A few weeks ago, I dumped the crappy carbs again.  I'm back full-on low-carb and have lost about half of that[1]. This time, I'm going to learn from my mistakes. :) I'm going to follow the Atkins notion of gradually increasing carbs until you find your ""critical carbohydrate level"".  Since I've bounced back and forth, I figure realizing that fact will be helpful in my long-term maintenance.<p>1. Yes, a very large percentage of this is water. I'm OK with that. :)",1361332703

Wait a few hours please!<p>On the other hand, weed substitutes for alcohol. From the paper  <a href=""http://www.iza.org/en/webcontent/publications/papers/viewAbstract?dp_id=6112"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iza.org/en/webcontent/publications/papers/viewAbs...</a> ...<p>""According to authors D. Mark Anderson and Daniel I. Rees, the passage of medical marijuana laws in 16 states have also helped to reduce traffic deaths. Can that be right? Does weed really reduce the speed?<p>The authors base their claim on statistics assembled using the the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, or FARS, which is a database collected by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Across the 16 states where medical marijuana has been legalized, it was found that traffic fatalities dropped by as much as 9 percent.<p>The FARS statistics do not prove that medical marijuana laws are the cause of the decrease in traffic deaths (such statistics can only provide correlation), but until now no research has been conducted to explain the relationship. Anderson and Rees offer up a couple of theories.<p>First, they suggest that marijuana is a substitute for alcohol consumption. Basically, if medical marijuana laws create an uptick in marijuana use, then perhaps people are smoking grass rather than imbibing in the drink. This should, in turn, lead to less drunk driving, which explains the drop in traffic deaths.""",1361332478

5248814,comment,5247436,5247713,5,0,shawndrost,,,"I teach at a school for js devs, and many of our students get started at Codecademy.  Based on what I've seen, they're already great at getting people to square one, but they're facing real challenges if their mission is to teach people to code.<p>Let's start with the good stuff: it's very, very engaging, and if I tell an applicant to go through codecademy, it's pretty likely that they'll get it done.  In other words, they're very good at conversion optimization.  They give the user very straightforward, bite-sized goals, and people end up doing a lot of work.<p>However, people that pass through this system end up with a very consistent and warped skillset.  It's not because they're still newbs -- I run into lots of newbs that didn't go through codecademy, and these guys are unusual.<p>1) They're very familiar with syntax, and can fluently type code for common tasks, but have difficulty solving problems with these tools.  For instance, it's very common that I find a codecademy graduate that can easily iterate through an array and initialize/modify variables, but not sum the elements in an array.<p>2) They don't model the program's execution in their head.  This is a really profound and strange fact, with lots of weird corollaries.  For instance, they don't have ways of dealing with errors when syntax-based guess-and-check fails.  The notion of code executing line-by-line is surprising to them.  This is a pernicious problem that requires unlearning.<p>It's very easy to trace these unusual skill profiles back to the mechanism that drives codecademy's success in the first place.  I don't know what I would do in their place, but I have a few ideas of things that I'd like to see in the space:<p>--A curated project-based curriculum that takes followers along a similarly-well thought-out path.<p>--A wconsole-based codecademy that makes heavy use of the debugger.",1361331891

That's exactly the point. Now you redirect ssh failure messages to a specific log file (with all the garbage and automated attacks), and you'll very soon start to ignore it.

I imagine with the momentum behind it there's a good chance it'll be carried along by the community.<p>Very simple API to tie into as well (if only it had OAuth built in...)",1361329444

They seem to have equalized quite a bit since. From the point of view of becoming a great web app dev, yes learning as much as you can is great. From the point of view of investing in yourself given a limited amount of time, that may not be true. For example if you have 6 months where you can switch careers, learning Haskell might not be your best choice. OTOH PHP seems great, since it is used in plenty of places.<p>These numbers do not mean that if you know X you will get a job. They simply tell show that there is some level of usage of these technologies in the industry. Try doing the same search for Scheme or Haskell or even Erlang. All great to learn and will make you a better professional, just not greatly popular in the wild.",1361329420

IB is really, truly awful, and just about impossible to use in a team with CM.  From most tutorials though, you'd think it was required.  Not only is it not required, but it's easier and more powerful to not use it at all.",1361329375

In the legal industry, for instance, this task is typically assigned to contract attorneys or paralegal staff.<p>There are of course auto-redacting solutions available, but due to the nature of the documents (scanned, inconsistent formats), and the potential consequences of either mis-applying a redaction or omitting one, manual verification is required.",1361329296

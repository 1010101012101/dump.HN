While the clients were both complimentary, I think I didn't do too well for one of them, where I came in to an existing codebase with a shortage of domain knowledge -- and this is going to be a general problem for a specialist editor, more so than with prose. I was more like a copyeditor. (For the other client I'd written the code they started with.)",1307566762

After a quick refresh of how the buffer cache works, i'd say that you are correct and that with the option above the server is also using a simpler data structure to retrieve those cached pages (no blocks list to traverse, no access locks). The difference in performance with and without this option was huge in a quick test, enabling the server caching i saw the number of req/s increase 400%-500%.",1307566577

Kids learn at different speeds and are interested in different subjects at different ages. Whatever subject you're talking about, there are some 8-year-olds who could benefit from it. The traditional approach of having grownups <i>decide</i> what material is suitable for what age is <i>guaranteed</i> to produce a mixture of kids who are bored and kids who are lost; khan materials present the promise that kids might be able to learn at their own pace and according to their own interests.

No fast implementations of FFT.  Probably no fast versions of memcpy. The reason is that coding is not primarily about writing for other people.  Look at Donald Knuth's code.  Extremely well-written, yet certainly doesn't stand on its own.

Entrepreneurs deal with failure. Either get on the horse again, or switch to a corporate job with a steady paycheck. Either choice is a valid one.<p>The second issue, elderly caretaking, if you don't want to do this, given that it sounds like they object to you being there, don't do it then. Let the rest of the family deal with them.<p>If despite this you are still committed to staying with the parents, then the obvious solution is to either do remote design work, or to start your own company. You are not going to be taking care of the parents 24 hours a day, this leaves much free time to create a product while enjoying low living expenses. Congratulations, you're a start up with almost no overhead.<p>If you prefer to take the corporate job to resolve issue #1, and still want to take care of the parents, then they will have to move to the city where your new high paying corporate job will be.

Truth is that their will never be an educational system that everyone thinks is perfect. We are all too unique and absorb information in different ways. The fact that people are talking about Khan Academy at this global scale is amazing and only further amplifies it's importance, last time I checked open source education doesn't generate too much press. So instead of seeking perfection, which is unattainable, we should focus more on actually doing the littles things to make knowledge more widespread.<p>To that end Khan Academy has no comparable peers. Critics can talk all they want about learning theory and this and that, but fact is that Khan Academy is really helpful to a lot of people.<p>If you think you see a flaw in Sal's approach and can do better, than just do it and we'll see if people like it.

Basically, I've got aggregated Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr feeds for 3 close friends sent to my inbox every week. Curious to know if this would be useful for anyone else.

2634796,comment,2633341,2634027,7,0,barrkel,,,"I cannot agree. There are so many ""facts"" that the mere selection of which ones get recorded already puts an overwhelming bias on the stories they tell. History is obsessed with narratives, and there is an ineluctable requirement, when doing history, to create a story where earlier ""facts"" leads to later ""facts"" in a hypothesis of cause and effect. The requirement for a pseudo-logical story with internal consistency further cherry-picks the ""facts"", until you're left with a complete bowdlerization of reality. The truth is, there are enough ""facts"" that you can very probably tell a whole lot of different stories using the raw material, but people have a very strong disinclination to cognitive dissonance and won't do this. They'll pick one and stick with it, and argue it against other stories in ego-driven battles, until a consensus emerges as a sociological phenomenon, rather than a fact-driven one.<p>One man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist. Criminals often think they're justified in the actions they take; in fact, often they must self-justify their own actions in order to sleep at night at all, so they will have their own internally consistent narratives. It's extremely difficult to fight the dominant narrative once it has become accepted.<p>IMO, the highest value history has is in telling stories about a world which is different from our own, but for which we have somewhat believable evidence actually existed. The degrees to which it is different tell us what varies in human nature, and what stays the same, stays the same. It teaches us to not take the present moment too seriously as some kind of apex or nadir. But I don't think it <i>actually</i> tells us a whole lot about the past, per se.",1307563679

The rate at which you can store or retrieve energy is independent from the amount of energy you can store. The first is by the size of your reactor, the second is by the volume of your storage tanks.

I get a rush every time I rip a package open.  Two, it's good for the ego.  It helps you keep perspective on how much you've been reading.  Three, you can underline the books as you read them, this can be VERY helpful. Unfortunately I do not recommend loaning books to friends, you will never get them back.<p>Awesome! You can start by reading 1 book a week, which is an aggressive but doable goal. To some it may not sound like much but if you have not been making a habit of reading regularly, it will take you a while to get back into it. In a year you will have read 52 books. I am of the belief that compound interest is most effective when you have staggering sums of money. It is second most effective when it comes to knowledge.<p>Amazon will sell you books for cheap, but there are many business classics that will probably be available at the local library. I bet your local library will at least have one of these seven books:<p>How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie<p>Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill<p>Seven Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey<p>{anything} by Seth Godin<p>Positioning by Al Ries<p>Getting Things Done by David Allen<p>21 Laws of Leadership by John Maxwell",1307563337

It was only by accident that the code happened to be the identical at that stage of development. The theory constructed (the factoring out) gave too much weight to limited information (an early stage of the program), overfitting to that specific information. Generalizing from two instances is almost as bad generalizing from one. In your terms, it models the program not the problem.<p>It's so refreshing to hear similar thoughts to mine. :)",1307563264

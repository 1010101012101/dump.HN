It&#x27;s unequivocally better than performance on OS X, further leading me to believe that Apple really needs to overhaul how animations are done. Even when I turn Transparency off in OS X, Mission Control isn&#x27;t completely smooth. Here, even after some Aero Glass transparency has been added in, everything is smooth. It&#x27;s remarkable, and it makes me believe in the 12-inch MacBook more than ever before.<p>So much this. I really admire how performance of Windows desktop is optimized. I can&#x27;t compare it with OS X, but when compared to modern Linux DE&#x27;s (Plasma, Gnome Shell, Cinnamon etc.), Windows desktop still has all the same modern bells and whistles (hw acceleration, effects etc.) yet it blows them out of water when it cames to both smoothness and resource consumption.<p>I say I admire the effort on optimization, because things weren&#x27;t that good even on Windows 7. I remember constantly having slight stuttering here and there on Windows 7 but Windows 8+ is completely smooth on the very same machine (which is now getting close to its 6th year), and this anectode shows that they must have taken the optimization seriously.<p>P.S: I&#x27;m not complaining on Linux DE&#x27;s, they just have different priorities, and they&#x27;re good deals considering their price.",1431780556

9555881,comment,9555295,9555295,0,0,mariusz79,,,"The Basic Income ship has already sailed, and it&#x27;s not coming back any time soon. The main reason for this is the fact that automation is here to stay. Every day new systems are being automated, first replacing low-skilled, low-wage jobs. People in these job don&#x27;t really have much power, knowledge, will nor money to push the BIG agenda. Often times, they are not even aware that such thing is being proposed.  People in better paying jobs are also being slowly replaced, but they rarely see this as threat to their jobs, but more like productivity improvement.<p>When some tradesmen, or engineer loses a job because of automation, they first try to work on their skills to stay relevant in the field. They usually won&#x27;t blame automation for being unemployed, but instead they blame their age, lack of specific new skills, outsourcing or the economy. Without  a well paying job, they quickly drop from the affluent middle class to a poor low class. In the mean time, their peers don&#x27;t see what the real reason for this is, and they happily continue working, hoping that it&#x27;s not going to happen in their case. They have no incentives to support BIG as they already believe that a lot of taxes go to support the lower classes, and put unfair strain on them.<p>This shift from middle to low class, is already happening. To keep themselves safe, the high middle class, and the 1%&#x27;s will support militarization of police, and push even more entertainment options to the masses. People will rarely revolt, as it&#x27;s easy to imagine that if you&#x27;re a father and see your kids starving, you will either work even harder trying to support your family, or you&#x27;ll drink, do drugs and abuse the kids because you may feel that you failed,  and you will try to hide this feeling not only from them but from yourself.",1431780277

I understand that you think there is a tradeoff, like in many design decisions.
However, you did not tell me what benefits you expect from having the syntactical distinction.<p>> It syntactically distinguishes information that applies to the tag from information to which the tag applies.<p>That statement alone does not say <i>why</i> it is a good thing to distinguish syntactically both kind of informations. This <i>looks</i> interesting, of course, to be able to have a distinction. The fact that there is a distinction on the semantical level does not mean it should be there syntactically, though.<p>The syntax for attributes is unfortunately flawed, which is why ...<p>> Any language feature can be abused. The proper response IMO is to stop abusing the feature, not to eliminate it.<p>... is taking the problem completely backwards. No language feature were abused. In fact, attributes were acting against a natural organization of information.
And that is why, as a <i>workaround</i>, it was needed to express meta-data with tags. I don&#x27;t expect you to agree with this, so consider a classical example of markup usage.<p>You want to represent a document, with reviewers, publication dates and authors (those are meta-informations, right?) as well as content (the actual text being stored).
However, there exists meta-informations about people (name, title) and dates (calendar). Where do we store structured meta-informations about attributes?<p>Unfortunately, attributes do not allow to express structured information, and they cannot have meta-informations attached to them.
Here is what you obtain:<p><pre><code>     <root>      
          <document author=&quot;id0&quot;
                    published_in=&quot;ACM&quot;
                    publication_date=&quot;2010/03/02&quot;
                    publication_volume=345
                    link=&quot;doi://1020301.202.301.1023&quot;
                    reviewers_id=&quot;id1;id2;id3;id4&quot;>

            ... content ...

          </document>

          <peoples>
            <people id=&quot;id0&quot;><name>John Doe</name>...</people>
            <people id=&quot;id1&quot;>...</people>
            <people id=&quot;id2&quot;>...</people>
            <people id=&quot;id3&quot;>...</people>
            <people id=&quot;id4&quot;>...</people>
          </peoples>
     <root>     

</code></pre>
Notice how informations about publication are scattered into different attributes instead of being a single attributes with sub-components? (has the document been published in March or February? In which timezeone?)<p>Authors are only indirectly referenced through identifiers, because the real structure cannot be easily expressed in attributes only.
Also, a list of reviewers is actually a string with semicolon-separated identifiers.<p>An so, peoples are not just meta-informations, but tags with nested children and you must have a &quot;root&quot; element around your document, and a special list of &quot;peoples&quot;.
Just to be clear, having identifiers is not bad and could be a good way to model relationships.
The problem is that you do not have a choice anymore of using different level of meta-attributes.<p>Notice how the link to a &quot;DOI&quot; identifier is itself encoded in a string (this is a custom format just for this example), instead of using a more useful nested structure:<p><pre><code>       (link (protocol doi)
             (path (digits 1020301 202 301 1023)))

</code></pre>
Each time you use a string to encode structured information in an attribute with a custom mini-language, you are asking for trouble.
Imagine how each of those strings now need to have a dedicated parser because you need to take care of escaping &quot;special&quot; characters.<p>You might say that this is unfortunate that attributes are &quot;flat&quot;, and that maybe a kind of hierarchical way of expressing attributes would be more preferable.
And then, you would have nested-attributes as well as nested-elements. Why not merge them into the same syntactical structure?<p>If you consider that identifiers are not necessary, or if your format allows for sharing common sub-expressions (like #1=(author), #1#), then you could go with that kind of data-format:<p><pre><code>       (document (author (name &quot;John Doe&quot;) (job-title &quot;Professor&quot;) (institution &quot;MIT&quot;))
                 (anchor
                      (link (protocol doi)
                            (path (digits 1020301 202 301 1023)))
                      (target blank-page))
                 (reviewers (reviewer (name &quot;...&quot;))
                            (reviewer (name &quot;...&quot;))
                            ...)
                 (encoding (utf 8))
                 (sections
  
                    ...))
</code></pre>
Then, you have multiple layers of &quot;meta&quot;-informations, instead of just 2: &quot;data&quot; and &quot;dumb meta-data&quot;.
I agree we disagree, but I do not think both approaches are equal.
You talk about tradeoffs, but I really do not see anything useful in having attributes, whereby I can see the inconvenience they bring when trying to structure information in a meaningful way.",1431780269

9555843,comment,9554677,9555811,0,0,treelovinhippie,,,"Yeah true. Though one way it could play out is that the existing behemoths transition from a centralized company structure to a decentralized algorithmic structure to save costs.<p>If the &quot;boring&quot; functions of big tech companies can be automated, at some point it makes sense to just spin that out into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) aka smart contract/s on a platform like Ethereum. The company still receives the tiny transaction fee from that running contract, but they don&#x27;t need any employees/infrastructure/costs so overall revenue wouldn&#x27;t be affected from the change.<p>Consumer-facing nothing will have changed. Same apps, same beautiful interfaces. But 99% of the backend business operations will be performed by distributed, decentralized algorithms running on a blockchain.<p>Particularly as the sharing economy unicorns scale (Uber, Airbnb etc) they are essentially becoming the single interface and algorithm to entire industries. Uber will become the single monopolized UI to the entirety of all transport (people/food/parcels) with some other minor competitors.<p>But Uber can very easily be decentralized. And actually the bigger they get, the easier it will be to decentralize them as a third party (because the trained workforce and behaviour is established, and will gravitate on economics... lower prices, higher wages). And so <i></i>hopefully<i></i> the costs, competition, monopoly legal issues and scaling pressures (at 1B+ users) will encourage Uber itself to decentralize and run their entire operations transparently on a blockchain.<p>Maybe in some other capacity Google/Facebook/Apple/Microsoft/Amazon will follow suit. Though personally I&#x27;m looking forward to a world where sharing 24/7 video and audio feeds to the cloud for processing is seen as normal. Collecting all human input/output data is the first step in my opinion toward building a super AI around humanity. Google and Facebook&#x27;s centralized nature is capturing the most data at the moment, so they&#x27;re best positioned.<p>/2c",1431779147

[1]<p>Since everything is a value, this is not really &quot;aliasing&quot;<p><pre><code>    // b &quot;aliases&quot; a

It only appears to be by coincidence: The entire slice data structure gets copied, and one part of that is a pointer to the underlying array, which does not get copied. This is why updating the underlying array (via `a`) reflects in `b`.<p>Since `append()` either modifies the underlying original array, or allocates a new one if the underlying array is not long enough (classic dynamic array behaviour) [2], the use of this function will only impact `b` if a new array is not allocated.<p>To be fair, the article mentions all of this, but sort of in passing and at the end.

I, and the other engineers, also attempted to get our management to recognize what google was doing right.  Unfortunately, we were delayed greatly by bad technology choices forced on us by venture capitalists (e.g. ""build your search engine on top of Oracle! they say they have full text search, it will save you time!""[1]) and management short-sightedness (""our future is selling audio video search results to ISPs and portals, not being our own portal."" -- this despite google not being a portal.)   They actually got worried when the search box on our homepage started getting more queries than some of our larger customers.<p>Now, FWIW, I'm building another search engine.  Instead of 20 engineers we have just me.  Instead of 4 years, we're going to do it in one.  While I have no interest in going up against google (different plans entirely) the radical change in leverage you get with open source and PAAS or IAAS, combined with Google's having taken their eye off the ball and run off to chase Facebook down a blind alley, means that something like DuckDuckGo actually could take real share away... maybe.  (%1 of google's volume would be ""Real share"" right?)<p>[1] Oracle did have full text search but did not have the performance or per-machine-efficiency we needed, so it cost us a lot, and it was a constant fight to get it to do the kind of queries our relevancy algos required.  we had a constant stream of consultants in from oracle HQ, and in the end dumped it and wrote our own db from scratch in about 4 months.",1336074807

In the ""bad"" year 2 years later, you obviously can deduct it, but as your earnings are low, you're in a lower tax band or even wouldn't be paying any tax at all (which is the case for me).

I always loved reading posts about the coolest offices out there.<p>But You know what really attracts talent? Talent attracts Talent....More importantly, talent doesn't waste money. While cool offices definitely have their value in both work ambiance, feeling cool about working somewhere they can brag about, etc...I think there are way too many emotional and nuanced triggers at play that 42floors seems to be overlooking. 
I think a startup like this really needs to focus on their core value proposition, which is making finding the right space easier. So far, I think they are very far off base from solving that problem. Until they do, the marketplace for products is basically irrelevant.<p>It's an interesting situation because most marketplaces have a chicken and egg problem. The solution is usually to subsidize the side of the market that needs an extra push to participate. (When we launched gamestaq we thought we needed sellers for inventory, so we focused on them, but we found out later on that the buyers were a much more competitive market, and we never got the traction we needed because the buyers were loyal to price only, and the sellers had no barrier of entry. we had too much supply not enough demand.)<p>In this instance, they are taking a chicken and egg problem, and turning it into a chicken and egg, and breakfast omelet problem. They are making a huge assumption that finding the customers looking for office space are the easy guys to find, because they have a real problem.<p>What they just might discover is that the ""customers"" are the hard ones to find, and instead of focusing on selling them, they should be focusing more on attracting them with real solutions to real problems they have.<p>Bottom line, a broker making a 4% of the life of the lease commission is much more likely to be helpful to me as an office space searcher than a website pushing unnecessary product and social pressure to compete on me. Especially when they exacerbate a problem like finding good talent, and push it even further with hogwash that wasting money attracts talent.

From their site:<p><i>Copies of the thing: the album, the DVD, a print from the show. These items should be priced what they would cost in a retail environment. ...<p>Kickstarter isnt charity: we champion exchanges that are a mix of commerce and patronage, and the numbers bear this out. ...<p>So what works? Offering something of value. Actual value considers more than just sticker price. If its a limited edition or a one-of-a-kind experience, theres a lot of flexibility based on your audience. But if its a manufactured good, then its a good idea to stay reasonably close to its real-world cost.</i>[1]<p>So their platform is flexible. It works as a way to take pre-orders for a speculative new product (with no guarantee product development will succeed), or as a way to seek patronage for your art. As far as I can tell they're not too opinionated about which of those you go with, as long as you're creating something.<p>I think the key when you're running a project is to be clear about how you're using the platform. People think very differently about buying products and patronizing art, so you need to structure your offers and your story differently.<p>As I said in the last thread, I think the Light Table project got off on the wrong foot because it wasn't clearly positioned as either a product or an artistic endeavor -- it was more like, support my cool project, and then I'll own a nice product I can sell to you later. Offering a license at every contribution level went a long way to clarifying the message.

3925336,comment,3925009,3925009,16,0,exDM69,,,"tl;dr: Long rant about Android internals. I work with them.<p>Quote: ""The notable exception, of course, is Android, but that may well be the exception that proves the rule: only a company with the financial resources of Google can hope to take on responsibility for that much code and hope to maintain it over the long term.""<p>If you start studying (or working with) the internals deep enough, you'll find out that Android is full of stupid technical decisions which cannot be sustainable in the long run. Having a Google-sized budget helps but there are some really weak links in there.<p>I'll give two examples: the first one is Android's C library, Bionic. It seems like Android wanted to avoid using GNU libc just to avoid the need for having to upstream local changes due to GPL licensing in glibc. So they went ahead and wrote a friggin' C library, arguably the most peripheral and boring of all the software components in an operating system. And also one that's quite laborious to put together and maintain. It takes special character to do that. Ask Ulrich Drepper.<p>You may argue that Android doesn't need all of glibc or that Bionic does it's job. From a customer perspective that may be true, but a customer does not see the libc anyway. But in reality, there's lots of hard work going on every day to ship products with Bionic. I've been watching that happen a lot recently. A lot of these issues seem to be related to threading and C++ ABI issues. The issues that glibc was struggling with 15 years ago.<p>Another bad example is Android's 2d graphics library, Skia. It is the reason why Android home screen looks so crappy slow compared to certain competing products. It has a similar API to a lot of graphics packages that were popular in the 1990's. It includes bitmap blitters and so on. They have some optimizations to use NEON SIMD instructions, but it's inherently a software (CPU) graphics lib. The synchronous API offers no opportunity for hardware acceleration. I am under the impression that Skia would be going away from Android and that's a good thing.<p>I promised two examples, but I'll give one for a bonus: Android's proprietary interprocess communication mechanism that's implemented in the kernel (can't remember it's name). It was designed to avoid a memcpy call when passing stuff from one process to another. That was a reasonable solution with slow uniprocessor computers of early 2000's but that ship has sailed. These days this kind of things are better done in the user space, like Dbus, which is used by most desktop (and some mobile) linux distros.<p>Whoa, what a rant. But it only tells one thing: I'd much rather work with a GNU/Linux system than an Android one.",1336073361

When there are hundreds of functionalities you could choose from and you don't remember the exact name, the traditional menu is much more discoverable. At the moment, HUD only complements the menu without replacing it altogether. But if the HUD is some day going to replace the menu, it will probably need to incorporate some of the features of the traditional menu on the way.

Neither the design choices nor specific details have been vetted or backed up by real deliberations.<p>There are tons of ways a committee of experts could improve Spdy, but it looks like Google is just going to show up with their draft RFC and demand a rubber stamp.<p>But this is just typical Google.  Even when they do work with committees they show up and for instance say 'add big integers to JavaScript <i>or else</i>' (the 'or else' being Dart).",1336072658

Respect still has to be developed based on observation of character and discernment of intent.  A rich heir who gives to generously and has a negative character is probably attempting to buy influence or assuage a guilty conscience.  A guy buying drinks for every attractive girl in a bar is probably slimy.  Those acts have no payoff unless someone responds in the manner that the act was performed to induce.<p>My hypothesis here is that the happiness is coming from creation and strengthening of interpersonal connections as a result of post giving interaction, not from the act of giving itself.

Essentially, they were much more work for the user (in terms of reading, holding and storage). The opposite is true of text on the Web  navigating between pages is more trouble than scrolling downward. In the worst case, scrolling down a page in a digital document is as much work as navigating to a different page, and there are a lot of ways it can be easier. One long document doesn't necessarily take up much more physical space or cognitive resources than a short one, but a whole bunch of related documents are often harder to navigate than a single one.<p>Remember, scrolling was the dominant way of reading documents on a computer long before the Web came along. Some programs used a page interface, but again, it was generally more trouble, and scrolling won out on its merits. The only areas where paging dominates over scrolling are those meant to emulate physical media (e.g. ebook readers) and those where reader satisfaction is a secondary goal (e.g. news sites that divide stories up to boost ad views).",1336072425

Rather, that I believe it's more market forces at work, but that cost of living plays a huge factor in that.<p>From the article you linked, that statement is reinforced:<p><i>""There's less competition among physicians in smaller communities and rural areas,"" says Bohannon. ""There isn't that same downward pressure on reimbursement that you have in metropolitan areas. Generally, smaller communities have to pay more to attract physicians.""</i><p>This is the market at work.  It doesn't matter what the cost of living is in those areas, what matters is the demand for the position.<p>I also can't ignore that that study is done against 'regions' so large that the cost of living within any of those regions probably swings wide in both directions.  This is to say that a doctor in the ""Northeast region"" could either be in NYC, or way up in the Aidirondacks.  Both New York state, both factoring into the ranges on the study, but huge differences in CoL.   If you have something more specific, I'm happy to be proven wrong, but in my experience, I don't have anything to refute it.<p>Regarding BIGLaw, I wasn't referring to ambulance chasers either, but I concede that I don't personally know of any biglaw attorneys that have jumped locality.

There's the ""building a factory"" analogy or ""instructions for climbing mount Everest"" analogy.<p>My focus was to try to explain the nature of the work a programmer, how it differs from linear or scheduled work and issues such as why it can be hard to estimate software project development time.<p>Most anyone working what I call ""linear"" jobs has a hard time understanding what programming is about.  They get to the office and have n tasks to complete.

3925218,comment,3924657,3925102,1,0,jballanc,,,"I think you'll find the difference between working with Cocoa APIs in Obj-C vs Ruby is that it's much easier in Ruby to turn what you've learned into a simple, boiled-down, easier to digest set of helper methods/objects/modules.<p>For example, in using the RubyMotion beta, after I understood the UIView animation flow, I created a helper method using ""yield"" to do the actual animation. If I were working in Obj-C, it would've been a lot more work to do the equivalent (and I probably would've just copy-pasted existing code around instead).",1336071710

Most of these companies would view a 200k salary as unreasonable.  I'm not so sure.<p>Examples abound, but I remember a company talking about how great its salaries were, and one example was a guy with a PhD from University of Texas (Austin) and 5 years work experience.  His salary was $125,000.  I wouldn't expect it to endear me to many Americans to scoff at $125k a year, but when you think about how long PhD programs are, how high the attrition rates are, how much talent it takes, and the kind of salaries available to people with professional degrees that take a shorter time (with far lower attrition rates)... well, it's pretty clear that $125k actually isn't all that competitive.  I'm sure that it would give employers sticker shock, but to get competitive with the other fields attracting the best and brightest, they might well have to go over 200k for someone like this.<p>If it's not ""worth it"", then clearly there is no shortage, it would be a suboptimal use of talent.",1336071687

Motivated people can succeed without these things, and the prodigal will fail despite them.  These things are mainly valuable to those around the median of intelligence/motivation distribution.<p>It is easier to find a relationship with money.  The person you are in a relationship with will love your money, and tolerate you.  Women do love successful/capable men, but in my experience it is the success that is attractive, not the money.  As an example, a bankrupt but famous actor or rock star will massively out-compete a rich hedge fund manager.

3925212,comment,3924639,3924963,4,0,automatthew,,,"Regarding the architectural question:<p>We actually tested a few designs using m2 and 0mq during our R&D phase.  0mq's push/pull sockets provide the same ""take"" behavior as the Redis RPUSH/BLPOP, so we definitely could have used m2 as the HTTP end of a similar architecture to what we use now.<p>One of the considerations that led to the choice of Redis was the transparency of the queueing and dequeueing.  The messages in the queue are easily inspected, and the Redis MONITOR command helps greatly in debugging.<p>More important from a design perspective was our desire to hide the HTTP specifics from the workers.  m2 pushes a JSON or tnetstring representation of the HTTP request to its workers, but we want the task we send to the workers to be generalized, stripped of information that is only meaningful for HTTP.  We also want to classify the task by resource type and requested action, which allows us to use multiple queues.  Multiple queues allows us to implement workers on an ad hoc basis.<p>M2 could work here if our request classification only depended on the URL.  But that is a limitation we are not willing to accept.  Request headers can be very useful in dispatching, especially those related to content negotiation (Accept, Content-Type, etc.)<p>There is an interesting hybrid approach using mongrel2: write one or more m2 handlers that perform the same function as our node.js dispatchers. I.e. m2 sends the JSON-formatted request to an m2 handler that deserializes it, removes the HTTP dressing, classifies the request according to type and action, then queues a task in the appropriate queue.  A worker takes the task, does its own little thing, and sends the result to an m2 handler that knows how to re-clothe the result as an HTTP response and deliver it to the m2 cluster.<p>Regarding the question about queue behavior across replicated Redises:<p>I do not know for certain, but I do certainly hope it is not possible for an item in a Redis list to be popped by more than one client, no matter how the replication is configured.<p>With our architecture, we could relieve at least some of the strain on the task/result messaging system by using a cluster of Redis servers for the task  queues.  Each queue server might have its own cadre of workers listening for tasks.  The return trip (getting a result from a worker back to the HTTP front end) is a little trickier, because it matters which HTTP server is holding open the HTTP connection.  You could use PUB/SUB (which I believe is how m2 currently does it), or each HTTP server could be popping results from its own result queue.<p>When using a single Redis server, the only hard limitation we have seen with using the BLPOP operation is the number of client connections Redis can keep open.  In case it's not clear, the BLPOP is blocking for the client, not the server.",1336071641

The very first method I wrote blew up with a memory error. The reason? I used the NSFontMatrixAttribute of NSFontDescriptor. For some reason, ARC doesn't handle it correctly. I've never had such a thing happen in Ruby.<p>There is still a long way to go from where Objective-C is. It's moving in the right direction, but there's still a long road ahead of it. Ruby is closer to being there, though the lack of tool support (particularly autocomplete) makes it a much less compelling proposition than it would otherwise be.<p>Also, Ruby can be considerably easier than Objective-C to read because there is a lot less line noise. Objective-C's method names read very smoothly out loud, but they can also be visually overwhelming at times and make code sort of melt together into a wall of text. It's maybe a little bit easier to read Objective-C quickly when you're being very deliberate about it, but it's much easier to skim Ruby in my experience.<p>I probably won't be using this, and I think your criticism of Rubyists is kind of valid, but I think  for this particular project  you're dismissing it too readily.",1336071618

You have to be willing to invest effort into things that hold your interest, but until you've done something for a while the aspect that holds your interest is the result and not the process. For example, I didn't get into programming because I loved programming. I got into programming because I didn't know what to do and I thought making video games would be cool. After a couple of semesters (yes, this was late in my life >.<) I realized that hey, programming is actually quite enjoyable! Now I try to invest in opportunities for self-improvement in the programming space (among others).<p>""Self-help books and workshops arm us with ways to trick ourselves into doing things we perhaps should, but generally dont want, to do.""<p>That seems like quite a generalization. I get that it's hard to create a catchy title without making some form of generalization, but... really? I guess the author is talking about workshops like ""How to write and sell your awesome novel in 7 days"", but what comes to my mind when hearing ""self-improvement"" is something like the 7 habits.

And the number of people that think athletes are ""stupid"" is amusingly large. A large number of the latter are ignorant of the former, including a large chunk of ""intellectuals"" contributing to closed access journals. people are intelligent in various ways, 3D spatial intelligence for example does not translate into wirting per-se.

OSM is cool as we know, but it was not deployed until now, and the reaction is epic.  Apple will fight the good fight like bing is doing in web search, but ultimately will be found wanting, just like bing. The only f-u play Apple has left is to spend billions of dollars making OSM on par with GoogleMaps, contributing that knowledge 'upstream,'watching specialized maps services eat google maps' ad lunch. I seriously doubt that would happen, but it's the only play left.  ""If I can't play then no one can...""",1348178521

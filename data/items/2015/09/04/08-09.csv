You can&#x27;t put random turing-complete computation in the middle of a maven project definition; you can only invoke well-defined plugins (if you want a custom build step, you package it up as a plugin - written in ordinary java, unit testable and all the rest of it).<p>The result is there are no &quot;snowflake builds&quot;. One project tends to build exactly the same as any other; virtually every project uses the same source directories etc.. It makes it really easy to be productive straight away when switching projects. And the limited build steps mean the IDE integration can be very complete.",1441357121

We proceed to express them with thought, dance, music, etc. Without them we would have very little to express or digest. Most thought and contemplation can be traced to an emotion that we had or that isn&#x27;t going away. eg.

So I asked - well, it should be fairly easy to check with the right equipment, no? And he said that yeah, it should be fairly easy, and even though multiple universities expressed interest in doing it, no one is willing to cough up the money for it. I guess this is very similar - of course it would be extremely interesting to find out where that water is going,but redirecting the flow of water would be very costly, and apart from satiating some scientific curiosity there&#x27;s little reason to undertake such large engineering project.",1441356225

There&#x27;s likely to be many features that will be highly correlated all of which will enter a statistical model.<p>Keep in mind - actuaries already use all sorts of information about you in order to price a loan.

That leads to serendipity and opportunities for potential that is sitting on the sidelines. I&#x27;d argue that this is a better methodology for society as a whole; a little bit of chance/risk.

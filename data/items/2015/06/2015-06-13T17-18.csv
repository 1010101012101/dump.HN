9711900,comment,9711112,9711588,0,0,bediger4000,,,"I agree. I&#x27;ve had Secret clearances at two different companies (aerospace/defence contractors). One of my lessons is that anyone who gets a clearance draws a lot of people into the process with them. It&#x27;s a bad and creepy side effect, and even though this mostly involved college friends getting grilled by Federal Agents, I wouldn&#x27;t do it again.<p>In fact, I&#x27;ll go so far as to say that &quot;clearances&quot; are a symptom of the pathology of the security state. Lots and lots of highly cleared people have gone wrong (Pollard, Ames, Hansen, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s more), so the process isn&#x27;t really all that helpful. For a corporation, having &quot;cleared&quot; employees does two things:<p>1. It raises a huge barrier to entry for competitors. A smaller company just can&#x27;t afford the specialized record keeping and record keepers, so only lumbering dinosaurs have cleared employees.<p>2. It means that the corporation can say, just like my kids, &quot;I didn&#x27;t do it!&quot; as an excuse. An employee goes bad? The corporation didn&#x27;t do it, because the Defense Investigative Security Clearance Organization cleared that traitor. It&#x27;s yet another excuse to not have a relationship with employees, just like drug tests. Managers can just fill out forms, they don&#x27;t have to know or like or have meaningful conversations with employees.",1434218334

It&#x27;s use relies on all the same implicit threat of state sanctioned violence and its infrastructure as its closed proprietary opposites.  The GNU license is meaningless without modern intellectual property focused trade agreements to provide teeth when there is a violation.<p>The GNU license is inherently litigious. That&#x27;s the nature of licensing. Alternative licenses are also <i>de jure</i>, but some are <i>de facto</i> non-litigious by virtue of permissiveness. The primary contract for a GNU license is legal and the social contract is secondary...I&#x27;m not <i>giving</i> back when I am coerced by the threat of legal sanction into the act. Gifts don&#x27;t come with strings attached, and it is reasonable for someone to hold the ethical belief that true <i>giving</i> means placing creative works in the public domain.<p>Which is to say that GNU lies on a spectrum and reflects some noble ethical values and not others. Among those ethical values GNU does not reflect are many that deem an intellectual property infrastructure backed by state sanctioned violence on behalf of wealth [e.g. music downloader prosecutions] worse than actions which GNU&#x27;s copyleft prohibits.",1434218146

9711879,comment,9711112,9711684,0,0,EthanHeilman,,,"> what about physical access? What about compromised individuals, or nefarious agents?<p>Always a risk and a very hard problem to solve since someone always needs access and that person can be compromised. Detecting and preventing this is what counter-intelligence is for, but counter-intelligence is never a guarantee of security.<p>You can trade off usability for security to slow the speed at which an attacker can copy everything giving you more time to detect the activity. This only makes sense if they information is exceptionally important to protect. That being said, even paper can be stolen in large quantities. Jonathan Pollard managed to steal quite a bit of classified paper from the US during his tenure. The Israeli&#x27;s needed multiple highspeed copying machines to keep up with his  output [1].<p>One could imagine a system in which records are stored in multiple places and people only have access to the local files. No one agent could compromise the entire system. Then again, you might be so secure you protect the information from yourself and may not be able to &quot;connect the dots&quot; which is probably what you have the information for in the first place.<p>As Snowden suggested, &quot;The Two Man Rule&quot; [2] can also make enemies spies jobs harder. While it is true a determined attacker can overcome it by gaining the other parties credentials, such actions raise the risk the spy being caught.<p>A very silly idea:<p>I&#x27;ve been told on older nuclear armed submarines the device used to launch the missiles must be carried from one part of the sub to another to begin the launch sequence. The device was extremely heavy and awkward requiring multiple people to move it and making the movement of it very obvious and loud. Thus, they accidentally achieved an additional &quot;Two Man Rule&quot;. Perhaps if very secret information was encrypted and then stored on heavy large objects which could only be read/decrypted at another location in the building than it would be difficult to quickly steal and decrypt many of the files. A computational version of this would be a cipher that requires massive resources (memory, CPU) to decrypt. This is likely more fantasy than reality, but at least enemies spies would have to break a sweat.<p>>Interesting, and in line with your comment about the Gozer Principal (is there anything more than a tweet about that?)<p>I&#x27;ve been working on a blog post on it, but I don&#x27;t really have enough content to flesh it out and make it worth reading at the moment.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=MDZlAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT66&lpg=PT66&dq=Jonathan+Pollard+xerox&source=bl&ots=O38QZx4Gg4&sig=hu-D_Sv2wGjhMcyJN4XglJZNc0Y&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAWoVChMIydO4y5eNxgIVBRSSCh10yQAX#v=onepage&q=Jonathan%20Pollard%20xerox&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/books?id=MDZlAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT66&lpg=P...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-man_rule"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-man_rule</a>",1434217947

It&#x27;s not clear that you can just relinquish all IP rights to something. This means that the user of the IP can&#x27;t be completely sure what they are and are not allowed to do with it, and they may be less inclined to use it than they would a BSD style license where they know what they can&#x27;t do.<p>Some public domain desgnations, like CC0, partially get around this problem by including a clause that says that if they can&#x27;t relinquish <i>all</i> rights, then they&#x27;ll relinquish as much as is legally possible. This helps, but doesn&#x27;t completely get around the uncertainty.<p><i>But mostly I think they are really concerned about this</i><p>Please don&#x27;t be so quick to pass judgement.

If someone is made uneasy by the idea of someone taking their code and &quot;stealing&quot; from them, but they still want to embrace their users&#x27; freedoms, and they use the GPL, more power to them.<p>The only way that the GPL restricts my licensees is by requiring them to not use the fruits of my labor to restrict other people&#x27;s freedoms.

be less likely to enter stable, romantic relationships. Additionally,
affiliative interactions with a partner may decrease
T levels, in turn reducing mating effort. We also expect T
variation within the group of paired men to be consistent
with variation in mating effort, although we are not able to
test this with our data set. For example, it may be that
paired-male T levels will be highest during times of sexual
activity with a partner (as suggested in Hirschenhauser et
al., 2002) or that variation in the strength of the pair bond
might explain variance in T levels among paired individuals.

Since switching away from Java we don&#x27;t miss any of the features you&#x27;ve listed. The problem with Java is the mountain of bloated frameworks which have become standard over the last 10+ years - things like Spring, Hibernate etc. which new developers are expected to learn. With Go new developers which join the team aren&#x27;t saddled with years of legacy frameworks which are expected as standard knowledge. The JVM is a great platform, but Java the language and to a greater extent its frameworks are a major liability for the future of the JVM. Go and Java (the language) are both incredibly boring to program in (a good thing in if you have developers of varying skill levels), but they are a safe choice with a low bar for learning. Java unfortunately has a mountain of legacy cruft which makes it a pretty terrible choice for new hires to ramp up on.",1434216064

If you are framing yourself as a consultant who can solve quantifiable business problems using frontend development, then ~$400 per <i>day</i> is absurd. I would say increase regardless of your living costs. Asssuming 30 weeks of utilization, you&#x27;re working for $60,000 per year. If you&#x27;re doing remote freelance work then you can target US companies and literally quadruple this.<p>I live in NY and I charge between $1000 and $2000 per day for information security services that normally take 2 - 4 weeks per engagement. Mind you - information security is a specialization that is not as quantifiable as developing a website for business purposes, so in theory you should be able to achieve higher rates than that (Brennan Dunn, as an example, charges $20,000 per week as of 2014, and he does a mixture of web development and copywriting).<p>If you follow &#x27;patio11&#x27;s advice you can certainly increase this. The beautiful thing about being a consultant is that you can choose to work remotely, which means you can anchor your cost to the living costs of your <i>client&#x27;s location.</i> I&#x27;d be charging the same if I lived in Kansas.<p>Increase your rates, and if necessary rebrand/reframe your value proposition. Also - get rid of the recruitment agency. Agencies can be good, but you need transparency regarding your rate and how much they are taking for placing you. You should also try to develop a strong personal network for referrals.<p>You will know when you&#x27;re successful because you start saying no to potential clients as much or more than you say yes.",1434215152

It is a short story like 16 pages, and I hoped to develop it into a full novel eventually. I wanted feedback from readers before writing more of it. Yet the first link is the original first edition before I made any changes to it, and you can read it formatting errors, etc and all.<p>Also the first edition did not have hyperlinks but the second edition did.<p>Oddly enough it does work somewhat. I wonder what other ebooks are sample only and which ones are the full version?<p>Anyway I just uploaded a new edition of the ebook, in 24 hours Amazon will approve or reject it. I wanted to give it away for free, but Amazon limits that, not only that but the lowest I can charge is $0.99USD and they won't let me self publish it to other ebook stores.<p>If anyone wants a free copy, email me at orionblastar@gmail.com if interested.",1362286787

The freshmen are given just a few rules to remember (""Don't flaunt your expensive headphones south of 61st St.""), but women are given endless lists. The freshmen hear their advice when they show up at college, but women get rape prevention tips drilled into them from childhood so they completely internalize it. And by and large, the advice those freshmen get is simple enough that it doesn't contain any Catch-22's like my earlier example: a woman can be blamed for angering the man who raped her by being rude OR for leading him on if she's polite, so some people will fault her either way.",1362285058

In those areas, it is much harder to define an actual measure of product goodness (in CS, we can always say that app X runs Y% faster or that Z% of the large number of users prefer it), and individual performance is evaluated much more based on _soft skills_. This is the exact skill set that is developed by the non-acacdemic parts of college.

The central points of what constitutes science aren't widely debated, but maybe the more nuanced points are.<p>For me, I think the most powerful definition of science is this: science is the capability of prediction.  If you can accurately predict something that happens at a future time or in a different place, then that's all I need to consider it science.  Of course, the more powerful your prediction, the better the science it is.  Predicting the stock market based on a hunch then is very poor science.<p>So does computer science make predictions about reality?  Yes, it does.  There's many algorithms describing things that <i>will</i> happen when run, and curiously enough, we can test these by writing a program!  We can even easily reproduce these programs for other people to run.<p>To give an example of the more scientific nature of CS, the study of quantum computing is almost solely in the domain of computer scientists and physicists.  Scott Aaronson, for example, is a computer science who has many interesting things to say about it (<a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/</a>).<p>Now, the application of computer science degrees to something like a startup may be more of an engineering task.

5312482,comment,5310486,5311806,7,0,nostrademons,,,"Dude, I look at 1993 and compare it to today and am totally amazed at how much life has changed.<p>In 1993, your circle of friends was pretty much limited to the people in your town.  <i>Maybe</i> you had a pen pal, but that was considered to be a rare novelty and took real work to maintain.  Now, I have friends all over the world, that I keep up on their day-to-day lives.  When an earthquake hit SF in 1989, my reaction was ""Oh, that's too bad, I feel bad for anyone who died.  I'm sure we'll be talking about this in school today.""  When an earthquake hit Japan in 2011, my reaction was ""Has anyone heard from Jennifer yet?  Is she okay?  I know she was in Sendai...""  And I had friends all over the globe - India, Colombia, DC, Boston, Morocco, LA - asking the same thing.<p>In 1993, if you were meeting a friend for an event at an unfamiliar place, you called them up beforehand, specified an exact time and place that you would be, wrote down the directions or brought along a road map, and prayed they would be there when they said they would.  If you got lost, you had to pull over until you could look at the map and memorize new directions.  If you couldn't find each other in the crowd, you were out of luck.  If you hit traffic on the way in, you'd hope they didn't think they were being stood up and apologize profusely.  Now, your calendar pops open a notification when it's time to leave, taking into account traffic.  You hit a button, and your cell phone navigates to the destination, automatically rerouting you if you take a wrong turn.  You can't find your friend, you call or text them.  You don't know what they look like, you call them and see whose phone rings.<p>In 1993, if you wanted to start a company, you worked your butt off for a big employer to learn the ropes of your industry.  You spread your network as far as it could go.  You sought out mentors.  You begged for funding.  And then you hired lots of people to make your dreams come true, and if your dreams were wrong, they all got laid off a couple years later.  Now, you Google [startup].  You read a bunch of blogs.  You download lots of open-source software.  You build something, you launch it, you post it on Hacker News and a bunch of blogs, and if your dreams were wrong, you've wasted maybe a year of your life.<p>If <i>your</i> life isn't all that different from 1993, it's more likely because you're still living in the past than because the world is the same as 1993.  ""The future is here, it's just not evenly distributed yet.""  For some people, the world is <i>wildly</i> different from what they expected 20 years ago.",1362283943

Remember, we're not <i>usually</i> talking about some guy leaping out of a dark alley and grabbing a stranger walking by. Most rapists know their victims and interact with them socially in the lead-up to the assault. Many deliberately arrange circumstances designed to create doubt about what happened and whether it was consensual.<p>I hate to link to a scumbag, but there was a reddit post several months ago by a serial rapist describing his methods that illustrates this quite clearly: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x6yef/reddits_had_a_few_threads_about_sexual_assault/c5jtt3p"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x6yef/reddits_had...</a> It is absolutely chilling reading, but horribly informative (as are his replies to questions later on). I'm as skeptical of anonymous comments as the next guy, but in the aftermath I saw a number of people saying, ""Don't give him the attention he wants: you can see exactly the same methods and mentality in formal studies of convicted rapists instead."" (Sadly, I never saw links to those studies, so I'm still linking to the scumbag.) It's clear that this isn't the sort of thing that inspires vigilante mobs, but my understanding is that it's by far the most common scenario.<p>Meanwhile, you need to be <i>really</i> cautious about bringing up the ""false rape accusation"" objection. Yes, they happen, and it's awful when they do. But every statistic I've ever seen indicates that the number of false accusations is miniscule compared with even the number of reported rapes, let along the number that don't get reported at all (perhaps because the only evidence was ""he said/she said"" that would get brushed off as potentially a false accusation). Treating actual rapes and false accusations as some sort of evenly balanced poles deserving equal consideration is not justified by the statistics.",1362283841

While entropy is a valid measurement of password randomness, it is not a direct measurement of how strong a password is. Take the password ""vvvvvv.vvvvvvvvvv7vvvvvv"" which has terrible entropy yet is very unlikely to be cracked. Why? because a cracker does not know that your password contains only three distinct characters and would still perform a brute force attack based on an assumption of higher entropy.<p>If you are talking about short passwords, entropy is critical in determining the strength of the password, but the true measure of a password's strength is the permutations required to perform a brute force attack. While range of character sets determine permutations, so does the password length. You can make up for one with the other, which is why ""vvvvvv.vvvvvvvvvv7vvvvvv"" is a very secure password.<p>That aside, I did address more of the math of the XKCD comic here: <a href=""http://xato.net/passwords/analyzing-the-xkcd-comic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xato.net/passwords/analyzing-the-xkcd-comic/</a>",1362283705

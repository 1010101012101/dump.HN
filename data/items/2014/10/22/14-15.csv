8492982,comment,8491576,8491854,0,0,orclev,,,"It isn&#x27;t really about efficient, it&#x27;s about making it simpler to reason about. Functional style is a different way of reasoning about state than OO, but they&#x27;re both fundamentally about abstracting state and making it simpler to work with and reason about.<p>OO takes the divide and conquer approach, by dividing state into progressively smaller chunks until each piece is small enough to reason about. The flaw with that is that at some level you need to understand and reason about the entirety of the state, and if you have a bug in some lower level piece it often exhibits as bad behavior in one of the higher level pieces. Figuring out which of the lower level pieces is ultimately responsible is 90%+ of the time spent on debugging in a OO program. Another challenge is that because state is mutable, just finding the starting point to debug the problem is often a chore because you must first get the system into the state necessary to trigger the bug. Even worse is that often the state you initially detect the bug in, is actually significantly further along than where the bug originates so you end up having to attempt to progressively walk backwards through time to arrive at the originating point (which in practice means running a debug session to a point, finding the next piece of state that looks wrong, setting new breakpoints, and then repeating the whole exercise).<p>Functional programming takes a different tack by instead strongly discouraging state altogether. A well written functional program will contain only the absolute bare minimum state necessary to accomplish the task at hand. Further state tends to be divided into two distinct camps, the global state that&#x27;s referenced by name (largely non-existent barring mutable IO refs and such), and the local state that&#x27;s passed explicitly as function arguments (ignoring for the moment the monad abstraction around that). Like with OO you sometimes arrive at a point where behavior isn&#x27;t what you expect it to be and need to go to a debugger to figure out where the state has deviated from the expected. Unlike in OO however you have the call stack to reference and can see exactly where in the history the problem originated. Finding the source of a bug in a large functional program tends to be rather trivial compared to the similar task in a large OO program, due to the more concise and limited state that exists in functional programs.",1413989848

Even though, technically, you can obtain a fully automatic weapon if you so wish. There are just a good deal of hoops you have to jump through to do so.<p>The reason I have no issue with this is because the government also has a duty to protect the common good. If it is determined by elected officials that specific weapons are far too dangerous to a large enough group of citizenry, then there&#x27;s no problem with limiting its availability. It is a difficult balancing act. The government may make it difficult to obtain permission but they cannot outright make it impossible. Which is the basis of many lawsuits against gun control laws.<p>Also, I suppose it depends on how you interpret &quot;arms&quot;. I define it to include weaponry we today call small arms, which range from pistols to rifles to machine guns. Which are available with an increasing level, based on lethality, of vetting before you can legally obtain said weapon. Any weapon beyond that list most likely just does not apply.<p>This is why I think the nuclear weapon example used by gun control people is just outright silly.",1413989543

You save characters, I see that, but I&#x27;m not seeing anything particularly compelling on the examples page [1].<p>The other big problem I see here is maintenance. WordPress is a particularly compelling platform because of its popularity and very large developer community. Build a site in WordPress and it&#x27;s easy to find someone else to improve and maintain it.

Its not that managers don&#x27;t want to think about security, its just that IT security organizations often don&#x27;t present a clear, consistent, <i>efficient</i> (in time and effort) interface to their customers to implement security policy, and management works around that by demanding broader access (in the limit case, public access) than is necessary, because otherwise the basic work can&#x27;t get done.<p>Security organizations very often forget that usability -- both of the secured systems and of the process by which the business owners of systems manage access -- is as important to effective security as technical safeguards.",1413988559

The first thing I developed was the main board of the game and it was definitely the hardest part (at least at the development side) since it needs to detect valid words. If you play around with it, you&#x27;ll notice that you can form combinations of words that are linked together, so you basically have paths of words that might be connected to one of the fixed words through this path, and are thus valid combinations (hard to explain, but I think it makes more sense when you see the gameplay). Getting this logic right involved a couple of weeks of trial and error. On the bright side, it increase my vocabulary skills :).<p>Most of the gameplay was developed locally, without any backend. By the game I was sure I could get the gameplay right, I asked my friend to join me and work on the backend. So for the past 3 months more or less, we&#x27;ve been working on getting all of the endpoints right, and testing, testing, testing and more testing to make sure we could catch as many bugs as possible.<p>In terms of hours, we probably put in about 2 hours per day on weekdays and about an average of 5-10 hours during the weekends.

8492814,comment,8492627,8492627,0,0,dozy,,,"Full disclosure: I&#x27;m biased as I&#x27;m primarily an Android engineer. But, I&#x27;ve led teams and developed extensively for both platforms, so I&#x27;ll tell you a couple things I&#x27;ve observed.<p>1. If you already own an iOS or Android as your primary device, that should play big into your decision. You&#x27;ll have a much easier time maintaining interest in your project as well as being more likely to create a more compelling product if you live on the platform.<p>2. Google&#x27;s Android documentation and guides are on a <i>completely</i> different level than Apple&#x27;s for iOS - Google&#x27;s is just so much more extensive. It&#x27;s really not even close IMHO. If you&#x27;re a beginner I think this will make a very large difference.<p>3. The iOS developer program and provisioning system is a PITA, even for experienced developers. Often times when learning something new, all it takes is a small roadblock to become frustrated and lose interest. With Android, building apps for you and your friend&#x27;s devices is very easy, and submitting to Google Play is <i>much</i> easier, with no review process and again just one guy&#x27;s opinion, but despite a recent (and dearly needed) makeover, iTunes Connect is still inferior w.r.t usability compared to the Android Developer console.<p>4. I used Eclipse + the ADT plugin for years and while it wasn&#x27;t terrible (I was come from J2ME development for BlackBerry so the bar was quite low), I was always jealous of Xcode. Google has now addressed this with Android Studio. It&#x27;s still a bit of a moving target, but I now consider on par or better than Xcode.<p>5. Don&#x27;t let the haters scare you away with the fragmentation arguments. &quot;Fragmentation&quot; is a feature :) Truthfully, if this is just a side project, I would set a minSdk for your app a minimum 14, or even 19 if you want to, and be amazed by how your app works so well on the 100s or 1000s of devices out there that it supports.<p>Couple words on iOS:<p>1. Whereas with the x86 emulator and Genymotion, the Android <i>emulator</i> has dramatically improved, the iOS <i>simulator</i> is still superior with respect to ease of use and pace of development.<p>2. If you go the iOS route, I would strongly suggest to go directly to Swift. It&#x27;s where the puck is going and you&#x27;ve got a chance at this point to be a relative expert among a sea of objective-c developers, who will need to learn it as Apple increasingly shifts the platform.<p>3. This is very subjective and nebulous, but after using both platforms extensively, I&#x27;ve found the iOS APIs are simply better. You&#x27;ll find things <i>just work</i> and you&#x27;ll be continually surprised to find the puzzle pieces just fitting together. (ie &quot;hey I wonder if there&#x27;s a way I do X...oh perfect there&#x27;s just a simple method call for it&quot;)<p>4. As others have noted, if you don&#x27;t have a Mac then the point is moot, Android is your only option.<p>Hope this helps!",1413987822

However, if I am honest with myself, I know what the service probably costs and most of the time, the variations in cost don&#x27;t cross the threshold of my budget. The real reason I am irritated to not see the prices is because I am hoping to see that it is free or extremely cheap. There is no reason for a business to accommodate my desire to get an unsustainable deal.",1413986812

We deal with information flows every day and can imagine ten different systems that could do this without even opening the door to the hospital.<p>The big &#x27;but&#x27; is that there are so many hidden requirements here. Privacy is a huge concern. Data on patients may not leave the hospital. With the devices we have these days, it is almost impossible to create a near offline system. Almost all devices are connected to &quot;the cloud&quot; in some form or another, making them vulnerable.<p>The fact that health insurers are grossly incompetent in this aspect does not mean that hospitals should go down to that level.<p>Another hidden requirement is that this system has to work, always, no matter what happens. Paper notes may not be efficient, or complete. However, you can be pretty sure that while the hospital is still standing, this system works. Making a digital system that is as reliable is a very hard task.<p>All this will make such a system a huge investment, not only the system itself, but also in training.

I think one issue with soccer is that there is a lack of discrete, measurable outcomes in the game.  I read a while back that one of the breakthroughs in basketball analysis came when they started tracking the total point differential during each player&#x27;s time on court.  Because so many points are scored in a game, and because so many games are played in a season, this stat was a fairly reliable and accurate picture of how a player would impact the team&#x27;s performance (which allowed teams to measure the impact of players who may not rank high in the more traditional stats).<p>In soccer, you don&#x27;t have a lot of data points to model against.  The number of goals scored is typically low.  Because of this, there is probably a higher level of uncertainty and variance in the outcomes of soccer games (and the prediction models as well).",1404890137

The equations of motion alone take up lots and again lots of space. (Imagine typing them in! I don&#x27;t even dare to think about adding a fourth degree of freedom) <a href=""http://users.jyu.fi/~samakapa/triplependulum/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://users.jyu.fi/~samakapa/triplependulum/</a><p>My dynamics course teacher actually showed that the double pendulum can be linearized by some approximations (throwing out some negligible terms, small angle approximations etc.), and that way two modes of oscillation could be found: antisymmetric and symmetric oscillation. Just try with small initial angles with OP&#x27;s script and you&#x27;ll see.",1404889202

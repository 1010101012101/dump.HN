2386792,comment,2386235,2386624,2,0,madaxe,,,"We're strange, insofar as we've a foot in the software door, and a foot in the agency door - there's method to our madness, insofar as the agency side of things is effectively our peer-review group. We're highly profitable, but everything, other than bare-bones just-about-covers-the-cost-of-living stays in the business, or goes on staff salaries. Our goals and the market we're in both require vast amounts of dev work. Success, for us, is either absolute or absent - not interested in half measures. We've had two 8 digit cash offers for the business, both of which we've refused, as we don't plan on exiting until the product is fully baked.<p>Ultimately, I guess it depends on what you want out of it - if you're after a lifestyle business, what you describe is just fine. If you're after total global domination, it's back-breaking effort for a number of years (or a huge injection of capital up-front, although that's generally a good way to lose sight of what you're doing).",1301486258

2386769,comment,2385424,2385656,3,0,robeastham,,,"I agree, there is no substitute for working on a real problem together outside of the pressures of an interview room. This'll really give you an insight as to how a candidate is likely to perform within your team.<p>I'd have to disagree that all resumes are nearly useless though. We need some way of screening people and I think we just need to improve the resume format. Perhaps by making a tech resume more structured and uniform across candidates things could be improved. I built MightyCV with the aim of doing this - it's a resume platform with hackers in mind. I'd like to see MightyCV become a service that shepherds candidates towards producing a resume that is actually useful to tech recruiters. A MightyCV allows you to hook into the API's for HN, Github and Stackoverflow. When integration is activated this means recruiters get a useful at-a-glance overview of what people have actually been up to in the community. I'm toying with the idea of using an aggregation of these metrics to produce an overall MightyCV score. I'd then like to create a MightyCV map that resume owners could choose to place themselves on. Candidates electing to be included on the map would only appear if they had attained a certain score. It'd be a little like how down-vote privileges work here on HN, i.e. you have to earn your way on to the MightyCV map. I guess if I set the score threshold high enough then this map could become a good source of resumes within our sector that weren't entirely useless.<p>Also I liked the OP's suggested list of questions too:<p>- What's the last project you worked on at your former employer?
- Tell me about some of your favorite projects.
- What projects are you working on in your spare time?
- What online hacker communities do you participate in?
- Tell me about some (programming/technical) issues that you feel passionately about.<p>I'm going to give some thought to how I could incorporate these questions into MightyCV. I might even consider making them compulsory for all MightyCV owners. What do people think? Is forcing people to include something in their resume a bad idea?<p>Anyway, if you've read this far you might be interested in seeing what a MightyCV looks like. Here's mine: <a href=""http://robeastham.mightycv.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robeastham.mightycv.com</a> (For those paying attention I don't think my theoretical MightyCV score would be high enough to get me on the MightyCV map at the moment. Answering SO questions is on my list of things to do in April).<p>If you like the look of it and want your own MightyCV then sign up for the private beta. There is a beta code and link in the first entry for experience within my resume. There are a couple of bugs I'm ironing out at the moment, mainly associated with the LinkedIn profile importer, but otherwise it's fairly robust. If you try it, I really hope you like it.",1301485844

From what I gather most clojure stuff never actually gain any of the possible multi-core performance boost that is one of promises of the language.<p>Not that I don't like clojure, but part of the hype is that it's supposed to do a lot of the scaling inherently just by the design of the language. But in reality it's never that simple. Switching from map to pmap doesn't do much, actually a whole different way of writing the code is necessary. I'd like to see a version of this that tries to maximise multi core performance, and see what a 12-core mac pro can do with the execution times.",1301485832

Questions would typically start with parts that were largely ""book work"" and move on to parts that required more careful thought. In addition, you could answer as many questions as you like. Therefore, to avoid people getting lots of marks by just answering all the book work, the papers were scored by squaring the scores for each question and then summing those squares.<p>That is: overall_score = sum(q in Questions | score(q)^2)<p>This practice stopped in ~2003 (now you can still answer as many as you like, but the mark for the paper is the sum of your top 3 marks for individual questions, so it's only really worth answering 3 as well as you can).",1301485745

* I've seen many many developers write SQL Injection prone code at least 6 years after this was written.
* Any developer that was around during 2000-2001 would know that this was before the time of CMS's (free or otherwise), libraries, frameworks, SQL abstraction layers etc.
* I'm pretty sure there is some server-side sanitising done too (before we'd heard of the term SQL Injection).

2386657,comment,2386443,2386622,13,0,dhimes,,,"Agreed.  I find karma average of little interest.  Unfortunately it does encourage a certain type of bad behavior in those who do.  I can appreciate what pg is trying to achieve with it, but I don't think it's helped the site, and in fact has perhaps detracted from some conversations that ""could have happened"" except the people came late to the thread.<p>I personally sometimes won't bother commenting on a low comment simply because there is little chance of an interesting coversation happening there.<p>The other thing that's messed up now is duplicate submission.  They should be forbidden again.

2386650,comment,2386584,2386614,26,0,yannickmahe,,,"There will undoubtedly be a crash. Prices are rising for two reason:<p>-Speculative buying (that's the cause of all the empty appartments in places no one wants to buy)<p>-Cultural reasons. When a guy wants to marry a girl, he has to own his own appartment. No when, no ifs, no but. If a girl were to marry a guy with no apartment her whole family would lose face. Because of the sex imbalance in China, there is a large ""demand"" of girls, and little ""supply"", so the ""price"" (quality, location and numbers of appartments) keeps rising. So this means parents of boys are constantly upping the ante, to get more and bigger appartments to try and ensure their son gets married. (my girlfriend is Chinese, so I am very aware of these issues...)<p>While the first reason would seem to indicate that the bubble would burst sooner rather than later, the second one seems to indicate that demand for appartment won't fall anytime soon.",1301483409

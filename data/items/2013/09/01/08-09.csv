6309576,comment,6308895,6309244,4,0,jlgaddis,,,"> If I&#x27;m not mistaken, it basically involves detecting anomalous traffic and telling upstream routers that you don&#x27;t exist for the source IP generating that traffic.<p>You&#x27;re thinking of real-time blackholing (RTBH). &quot;Source-based&quot; blackholing is not an option during most DDoS attacks (spoofed  IP addresses) so destination-based blackholing (what everyone refers to when they&#x27;re talking about RTBH&#x27;ing) is your only option.<p>By employing RTBH&#x27;ing, you effectively DDoS yourself. Say, for example, that you have a 5 Gbps pipe and an attacker is sending 10 Gbps of traffic to your web server with IP address 203.0.113.42. That level of traffic will saturate your network connection completely, making it completely unusable. Your only choice is to blackhole your web servers&#x27; IP address upstream by having your ISP(s) drop traffic destined to 203.0.113.42. At that point, your web server is unreachable by anyone and you&#x27;ve had to DDoS yourself, in effect, in order to be able to use your network connection again.<p>And if they spread their DDoS across all of your IP address space?  You&#x27;ll be able to use your network connection again when the attackers decide to stop. That&#x27;s hardly rolling your own &quot;DDoS protection&quot;.",1378025996

6309543,comment,6308316,6308316,3,0,WA,,,"There&#x27;s clearly one very easy fix that nobody seems to have mentioned so far: Communicate in a better way.<p>I found that the overall performance of a programmer is very hard to judge from the outside, especially from less-technical managers. But managers are there to allocate resources and <i>track progress</i>.<p>Tracking progress is the most single crucial thing for them. They want those tickets closed and they don&#x27;t care about the bug. They don&#x27;t understand that 1 line code might take a week and at other times, you do 500 lines of (easy) code in a few hours.<p>Getting a negative review could mean from the manager&#x27;s perspective: You don&#x27;t <i>appear</i> to make much progress. The solution then is not necessarily to become faster (although that might be an issue as well), but to learn to communicate in a manager-oriented way.<p>This could be a very simple status update email once per day and a summary of progress once a week. Don&#x27;t communicate <i>weakness</i> (&quot;I&#x27;m very slow at this&quot;), but <i>problems</i> and their <i>solutions</i>. E. g. &quot;The multi-threading task was implemented in a very inefficient way before. Occasionally, it leads to errors that are very uncommon and thus hard to trace. I&#x27;m working on it and I have an idea for a good solution that will increase performance as well, but it might take a bit more time.&quot;<p>Or turn the task back to him: &quot;I can&#x27;t reproduce the error in a reliable way. Could you please provide test cases / test data that lead to this error?&quot;<p>These might be some more or less contrived examples, but you get the gist.",1378025037

But it&#x27;s beta status kept me from using it, and even now I wonder if it really is production ready, or just API-stable (which they say they will be as per <a href=""http://semver.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://semver.org/</a>). I also don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really worth the up-front cost of learning and slowing down initial development of a new product, especially while at a startup trying to set an aggressive release date for the product.<p>I&#x27;m also a bit worried about the need for everyone on the team to learn how Ember works and its conventions, when they already know how to figure out whatever mess of ad-hoc jQuery and random objects someone would write instead (as bad as that is for maintainability). And finally, I won&#x27;t have the advantage of green field development, as there is an existing app which will be added to. So there will end up being a chunk of the app with Ember, and a (functionally separate) part of the app not using Ember at all..

6309497,comment,6306795,6306935,3,0,seandougall,,,"> So my question is, how do you solve this?<p>I think I can offer some insight on that, because I&#x27;m Figure 53&#x27;s employee #2 (after Chris). I live near San Francisco, where with some effort I could quite possibly find a job that paid 20% more than I&#x27;m making with Figure 53 if I wanted to. And my first child will be born in the next 3 weeks! Oh, I also bought a house in June, for extra measure. :-)<p>Would a 20% raise be enough to draw me away from Figure 53 to work for one of the many startups around here? Hell no. A 200% raise wouldn&#x27;t be enough. Some of the many reasons why:<p>- I&#x27;m passionate about our products, but even more so about the art that gets made with them. I&#x27;m a musician who learned to code in order to make the tools that I wanted to use, and now I get paid to make those tools, and help other people use them. Whether it&#x27;s a high school play or the Olympics, it&#x27;s really freaking cool to see what your customers create with your work.<p>- Family is important to me, and working from home (and not on a 9-5) means that I&#x27;ll be able to spend time with my daughter even after I come back from paternity leave. Chris is of a similar sensibility, so I never have to do any convincing on that score.<p>- I don&#x27;t have to worry about whether the company&#x27;s going to be around next month, because I know our money is being managed conservatively. We&#x27;re in it for the long haul, which our customers also appreciate.<p>In short, Chris solves the issue of employee retention by making Figure 53 compete in many more important arenas than salary, from the more banal things like job stability to the more intangible things that go into quality of life. That&#x27;s not to say that we aren&#x27;t being compensated appropriately for what we do -- Chris has made it clear he&#x27;s all ears if any of us ever feels we&#x27;re being short-changed. But otherwise, if I went to him and said, &quot;Hey, Schmooblr LLC is offering me 20% more, pay up or I walk&quot;, that would be a sure sign that I was not a great fit for the company in the first place.",1378023031

In Doom 3 BFG, as opposed to the original release, a lot of things were recomputed instead of stored in memory.<p>This begs the question, was it really faster to store that stuff (e.g. skinned meshes, shadow volumes) back in 2004 when Doom3 came out? Has the hardware really changed that much in the 8 or so years between the original and the BFG releases? Or was this another case of premature optimization and doing things the way they were always done before?<p>In addition to memory bandwidth vs. cpu throughput, the number of cores in your average consumer cpu has gone up from 1-2 to 4 (or &quot;8 cores&quot; with hyperthreading). Reading between the lines, this was a motivator for the changes. Sharing memory between the cores is expensive and clearly some of the changes were made in order to reduce sharing between the CPUs.<p>So if any of the Doom 3 coders are reading this, can you give some insight on these changes? :)",1378022452

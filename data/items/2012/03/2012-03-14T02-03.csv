It's called the ""EIR"" program, standing for ""Entrepreneur in Residence.""  Basically, the VC pays for people with a proven track record (Former COOs, CEOs, CTOs, Principal Engineers, etc..), a salary to evaluate startups and business ideas that come their way, and, on occasion, get involved with them - sometimes as managers, or contributors, but also quite often to reboot them under the auspices of the VC.  In general, these EIRs of the ""reboots"" consider themselves closely akin to being ""Founders"" - though their equity stakes are usually somewhat less, but, at the same time, they usually have a guaranteed round of funding from the supporting VC.<p>What YC is doing, (particularly with the guaranteed convertible) is extending this concept to people (presumably) somewhat earlier in their career.",1331693649

Amazing and funny front man in Tim Shafer. A proven studio that has released multiple games of similar small scope in recent years. Plus a pair of guys (Tim + Ron Gilbert) who practically invented the genre in the early 90s. Amazing, awesome, and wonderful that they were so successful but not necessarily a sign of things to come.<p>Wasteland 2 on the other is a different story. A front man with strong pedigree, but most people have never heard of. A game that came out in 1988 and only ever sold 100k units (plus lord knows how many pirated copies).

It's that terrible precision that we hate so much. But because we don't know, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. Yet everything happens a certain number of times, and a very small number, really. How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, some afternoon that's so deeply a part of your being that you can't even conceive of your life without it?

I do think it will create a lot more work for the partners during review and interviews, but presumably they have taken this into consideration.<p>If I had to make a prediction, I'd guess that this will greatly increase the number of people who apply, given that the abbreviated option is ""easier,"" having omitted many of the questions that require the most consideration/ research/ field experience. To a lesser extent, it will probably also increase the number of interviews granted, as there will be some impressive-sounding teams who might otherwise have embarrassed themselves somehow on the ""harder"" application questions.<p>However, I anticipate that a much higher percentage of people will be cut at the interview stage than in previous years, assuming YC is selecting for the same quality. I imagine its hard to judge a teams merit by the application alone, and the no idea application will make it harder still by presenting less data about these applicants. Ive heard a YC alum describe the idea-related questions as an intelligence test, so even if the idea is not itself important, it does serve a role in filtering applicants. So the interview will become even more important than it already is.<p>Overall, though, I think this approach will yield a bigger class than if teams were <i>required</i> to apply with an idea, and I believe thats good for everyone. If this new approach yields even a few hits that might not otherwise have been considered, it will be a big win for YC. The applicants benefit from a bigger network, and although the acceptance rate will probably be much lower, I doubt it will be much harder for a given qualified team to be selected under this new approach. It may even become slightly easier, on average.<p>TL;DR version - wider net --> bigger class despite a lower acceptance rate<p>For reference, below are the specific questions that appear in the ""regular"" form, but are omitted from the ""no idea"" form.

Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?<p>- What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?<p>- Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most?<p>- What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get?<p>- How do or will you make money? How much could you make? (We realize you can't know precisely, but give your best estimate.)<p>- If you've already started working on it, how long have you been working and how many lines of code (if applicable) have you written?<p>- How far along are you? Do you have a beta yet? If not, when will you? Are you launched? If so, how many users do you have? Do you have revenue? If so, how much? If you're launched, what is your monthly growth rate (in users or revenue or both)?<p>- If you have an online demo, what's the url? (Please don't password protect it; just use an obscure url.)<p>- How will you get users? If your idea is the type that faces a chicken-and-egg problem in the sense that it won't be attractive to users till it has a lot of users (e.g. a marketplace, a dating site, an ad network), how will you overcome that?<p>- If you're already incorporated, when were you? Who are the shareholders and what percent does each own? If you've had funding, how much, at what valuation(s)?<p>- If you're not incorporated yet, please list the percent of the company you plan to give each founder, and anyone else you plan to give stock to.

3701473,comment,3699484,3700079,1,0,dalke,,,"The Wikipedia article says ""Whilst adverse selection in theory seems an obvious and inevitable consequence of economic incentives, empirical evidence is mixed."" This paper gives more concrete empirical evidence.<p>The WP article later says: ""On the other hand, ""positive"" test results for adverse selection have been reported in health insurance,[8] long-term care insurance[9] and annuity markets.[10]"". The reference #9 is Finkelstein, A.; McGarry, K. (2006). ""Multiple dimensions of private information: evidence from the long-term care insurance market"". American Economic Review 96 (4): 938958.<p>Then if you go to the actual paper by Nathaniel Hendren, linked to by the Slate article, you'll read:<p>""""""Previous research has found minimal or no evidence of private information using the revealed preference approach in these settings. In life insurance, Cawley and Philipson [1999] find no evidence of adverse selection. He [2009] revisits this with a different sample focusing on new purchasers and does find evidence of small amounts of adverse selection. In long-term care, Finkelstein and McGarry [2006] find direct evidence of private information by showing subjective probabilities are correlated with subsequent nursing home use. However, they find no evidence that this private information leads to adverse selection in the form of a correlation between insurance purchase and subsequent losses in the LTC insurance market.35 To our knowledge, there is no previous study of private information in the non-group disability market.""""""<p>In other words, WP's ""'positive' test results"" isn't as strongly positive as you might think from that short WP summary. The finding from this paper is the development of a more useful model of the problem which can make more concrete statements like: ""For those who would be rejected, private information imposes a barrier to trade equivalent to an implicit tax on insurance premiums of roughly 65-75% in long-term care, 90-130% in disability, and 65-130% in life insurance.""<p>That could not have been done using the information in the Wikipedia article.<p>You complained about two things: that there are no new findings, and that the Slate article could have been writing from the Wikipedia article. I think I've shown that there are definite new findings in the actual report. It was interesting enough, after all, to get the researcher ""offers from economics departments at Harvard, Stanford, and Princeton.""<p>As to the quality of the Slate article - the entire first half is meant for someone who has never heard of ""adverse selection"", and it explains the topic much better than the WP article does. It then covers some of the research methodology, and describes the policy impact and ties to changes in US insurance law and politics. None of the last half is covered in the Wikipedia article.",1331690966

So this is offered in the spirit of addressing a possible issue.  If you haven't thought about it, at least thinking about it may help you avoid it.<p>What I would worry about would be the fact that there is a difference between  being given an idea and turning around a general idea into something new.  If you are already in business, and you are going to be successful, turning around an idea you already have into something different is a familiar process and a necessary skill.  On the other hand, the question becomes what happens with those who don't have an idea?<p>I can't speak for the people who will apply, but I know there is a huge difference between the attention I put into working on my own ideas and working on other people's.  Ok, these categories aren't mutually exclusive.  These aren't really comparable.  Even if forced by circumstance into doing a specific thing for a business, it's different than being essentially hired by investors to implement their ideas.  Again these aren't mutually exclusive categories or anything, but they represent something I would hope you'd be careful about.<p>One way to go about this would be to work with such people to <i>find</i> ideas after accepting them.<p>Being excited about something is important in running a business regardless of its size or scope.<p>Your response suggests you are aware of this.

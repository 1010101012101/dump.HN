Are the innovations just re-applications of existing ideas?<p>Not in every case, but certainly in many. Not to pick on anyone in particular, but let's look at Posterous. It's an email gateway for a blog. It's simple and elegant to use (I use it and love it), and they obviously rock at the biz/dev/marketing aspect of the business --- but is it really that innovative? How much does Posterous further the evolution of the Internet?<p>How about Quora? Again, great site --- but it's a question and answer app. It's been done at least a dozen times before. Does Quora increase the pace at which the Internet evolves?<p>I remember reading something from PG about music startups (paraphrased), that ""the music industry is a just a vacuum to suck your VC dollars."" Hence, he's not super stoked on investing in music startups.<p>He's obviously seen his share of failed music startups and has talked to others in the Valley who also have first hand experience with failed music startups.<p>But, is it possible that the Valley isn't thinking creatively enough about music startups? That maybe the Valley can't think creatively enough because it innovates between the lines?<p>It's also crucial to recognize that most disruptive businesses don't start in the Valley. They move there so their VC can keep an eye on them.<p>I don't know. I'll probably get banned from HN for thinking a little dangerously and questioning the established thinking so openly.",1287597128

1811968,comment,1811279,1811279,0,0,Maro,,,"This sounds pretty interesting.<p>We're currently in the process of hiring our first employee in our startup, so we're pretty amateurs at this. Here's what we did:<p>1. Find some sites to advertise the job. Wrote up a description of the position and made up two problems the interviewee must complete to apply (it's at <a href=""http://scalien.com/pdf/job.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scalien.com/pdf/job.pdf</a> but don't bother unless you're in Hungary =]). I guess if you could automate this part, eg. submission to a bunch of job sites, that'd be a killer feature I'd easily pay $5 for. Also, you could provide templates for the job description, reminders what not to leave out, host the files, etc.<p>2. Went to the local Universities and physically posted printed out ads. Your service could offer that somebody picks up the ads from our office and posts them for us so I don't have to waste my time doing it, I'd pay for that.<p>3. The person submits their CV and solutions per email. There's always a phase where I send the same template messages as an equalizer, I guess that could be automated, although it may be overkill. What could be nice, but only for a company with a lot of hiring, is to channel these emails to/from your service so you have a nice dashboard and history going back, etc. Again, it'd be nice if your service could provide reminders here, eg. did you remember to tell the guy what address to come to (eg. not the HQ but the other office).<p>4. Then the person comes in for the interview. Here we wrote up ~20 questions in a word processor and printed them out, we hold this in our hands and ask the interviewee the questions (""what's a JOIN?""). Your site could store these questions, so we could check them off ""knows""/""doesn't know"" style per interviewee, with an additional comment field. The service has to be really streamlined though, as at this point the guy is sitting across me and waiting for me to ask the next question. Your site could recommend a general flow / template for the interview, and I could maybe time myself on each segment, so as not to spend more time than 60 mins per interview. In our case I noticed that we spend 90 mins per interview, but things are pretty obvious at the 30-45 minute part, so helping me (and my co-founder) save time would easily translate to money.<p>5. ???

But, I'm imagining a world in which it exists, and it's pretty exciting.  What I think would be awesome is if you made a company that screens for only the highest level candidates:  You do all of the technical screening to ensure candidates are of a certain value.  You look at open source contribution, their blog, some source code (which coders could submit to you with an NDA or something), experience, LinkedIn, references, interviews, etc.  And you assign them a score, or maybe just a yes/no.<p>If you could have a screening process that was on par with, say, Google's, and became notorious for such a thing, I think you'd be in a position of extraordinary value.  You'd be offering <i>Google Quality Engineers who are actively seeking jobs</i>.  I think that's huge!  You'd attract business that are willing to pay for the best, and you'd attract talent that wants the best pay.<p>The main goal here is to establish yourself as having a rigorous and ""industry best"" screening process.  You only attract and accept awesome developers.  You do all of the work in the technical screening, and you front your reputation on that.  You only deal directly with candidates, and on the other end, with people in the position to hire.<p>Of course, there is a chicken and egg problem here.  So you'd need a lot of publicity out the gate, a decent pool of acceptable candidates, or a decent set of job availabilities.<p>I'm tired of being asked if I know what a join is, the pros/cons of indexing, the difference between by reference and by value, various OO questions (What's an abstract class do?), design patterns, what memcached does, etc.  And I'm sure places are tired of candidates that <i>don't</i> know these things.

I confess that I like the Nexus One for the reason that the original poster mentions -- I am a geek and a customizer.<p>One thing I've noticed, having spent time with both devices, is that there seems to be much more competition from free or ad supported apps on Android than on the iPhone.  I probably have 20 or so apps installed on my phone, but every single one of them is free.  On the other hand, my wife has 5 or 6 paid apps installed on her phone.  Furthermore, the iPhone seems to be well optimized as an app-delivery platform, whereas Android seems to be more focused on an integrated suite of tools (like Blackberry) -- it ships with a lot of stuff that I would have to grab as an app in iOS.",1287594021

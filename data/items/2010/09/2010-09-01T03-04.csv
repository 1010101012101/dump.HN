It's not just kids looking through YouTube for how-to videos; my parents and my grandparents use it too. The availability of information has changed many aspects of many types of relationships, and this particular observation is really part of a much broader trend which has by no means ended. As technology is evolving, responding, and spreading; I'm enjoying watching the internet become increasingly more pervasive and predictive about the sort of information all people need. The internet is - without a doubt - the world's largest and greatest experiment.",1283313572

But they're smart enough to realize that they can't afford to do that.  What they may want to do, though, is support themselves and possibly live something approaching a middle-class lifestyle.<p>Many students are smart enough to realize, as well, that if you can get a good job and financial security, you can afford to have free time to do things that interest you.  If you're scraping by in a dead-end job, it's a lot tougher to have hobbies or do any other sort of self-improvement.<p>And so they go to college, because they've been told over and over again that college is 'the best investment you can make.'<p>In some cases, that advice is coming in good faith from older people who grew up when a 4-year college degree basically <i>was</i> a Golden Ticket into the comfortable middle class.  In other cases, it's coming from 'admissions counselors' (aka 'recruiters') whose job it is to get signups in order to bring in Federal loan money.  What you don't hear from either group is that a college degree appears to be a declining asset; as more people have them, the benefit of having one (in terms of standing out in the hiring pool) goes down, at the same time the cost on average has outpaced inflation.<p>It's a shitty situation all around, and I'm honestly not sure what the best advice is to give a young person today.  But one thing I am sure of, and it's that the old canard about ""study what you love, the job will follow"" is a lie.  If nobody will pay you to do what you love, don't pay a lot of money for a piece of paper that says you're an expert in it.",1283313179

I think if there is a better article on their research, it may help in explaining better as this article seems shy on explanations.<p>Also, the article cites that the nondrinkers may be more likely to be poor.  This means a) less medical care to have doctors find things early, b) less stress, and c) they are not benefiting from escaping any stress they do have.  Really, this article seems more like, ""Stress kills, alcohol relieves stress temporarily, those who drink often have less responsibilities.""  So an alternative to alcohol: relaxation.<p>It also (as far as the article) does not go into detail about how many were from natural causes, etc.  I'd be interested in whether the nondrinkers were more prone to heart attacks and this caused the discrepancy in deaths.<p>I can see so many holes in the research that I think it is far from conclusive on the matter.",1283313051

1651762,comment,1651527,1651527,0,0,jjcm,,,"Java is a good starting language not because Java is good, but because it covers a wide base of foundational concepts in programming. I personally feel that the first language someone learns should both be strong typed and compiled. The reason is simply because I find the transition between [compiled -> interpreted] and [strong typed -> loosely typed] an easier transition to make than the inverse. In addition, learning a strongly typed language first gets students in the mindset of knowing what data structure their variable is in its current state. Java is strongly typed, a compiled language, and it's fairly easy to learn - all in all a good candidate for an educational language.<p>The important thing to know here is that just because you learned Java doesn't mean you're a Java guy. If your teacher is worth his salt he'll quickly make you realize that the foundations that Java teaches can be ported to every language.",1283312847

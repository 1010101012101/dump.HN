10298162,comment,10296149,10297199,0,0,andolanra,,,"PEGs can sometimes be pretty unintuitive. For example, consider the grammar<p><pre><code>    (&quot;a&quot; / &quot;aa&quot;) &quot;a&quot;\n</code></pre>\nin a traditional BNF setting, this grammar could match the string <i>aa</i> or the string <i>aaa</i>. However, this PEG will only accept the string <i>aa</i>, and <i>cannot</i> match the string <i>aaa</i>.<p>(This is because of how backtracking works in PEGs—or, more precisely, how it doesn&#x27;t work. With the input string <i>aaa</i>, we&#x27;ll first try to match <i>(&quot;a&quot; / &quot;aa&quot;)</i> against the input in a left-biased way, which succeeds because <i>&quot;a&quot;</i> matches. Then we&#x27;ll try to match the second expression—<i>&quot;a&quot;</i>—which also matches. Now we are done with the grammar but still have the last <i>a</i> in the input, so the grammar fails. There were untried alternatives, but they only appeared in earlier parts of the grammar which had already &#x27;succeeded&#x27;, so we never go back and try them.)<p>Additionally, both LR and PEG parsers take linear time to parse a given input, but PEG/packrat parsing has much larger constant factors. On small examples, this might not be a big deal (what&#x27;s 0.2 seconds compared to 0.02 seconds when loading a file?) but when doing large amounts of parsing it can definitely be a minus on the PEG/Packrat side.",1443549537

I dealt with these problems on a MUCH smaller scale (1K machines) but the challenges are the same...<p>Here is what I can derive from this info:<p>So given just 1500 idle Personalization R3.4xlarge instance for a given month -- if they did not use them, they were losing $265,140 per month on these instances (assuming a 36-month RI on these instances...) If they had these as no-upfront RIs -- then they are wasting $475,200 per month on these instances.<p>Obviously Netflix gets significant discounts on their RIs -- as far as I am aware the common customer will only get a discount of up to 5% off RIs after your initial $500K RI buy... im sure netflix has even better...<p>Anyway - as we dont know what the other instance types are that they use, if we were only to assume that the other 12K instances were the same and their utilization was only 50% of the day -- they would be wasting as little as $2MM/mo to as much as $3.8MM per month...<p>Finally - its great to see them mention specifically that the granularity of AWS is only hourly for instances - but their internal granularity is to the minute. The hourly granularity of AWS has been a thorn for some time. I certainly hope that Netflix will open source their spot manager at some point (Recall that AWS employees went out and started ClusterK with their spot manager, the Balancer, and then AWS came along and bought that little company up)....<p>There is <i></i><i>significant</i><i></i> value in being able to manage the spot market (your meta-version, like netflix, and AWS)....<p>What I would REALLY find interesting is if the Netflix Spot Manager were able to split and combine RIs and move them from zone to zone.<p>*Disclaimer: the napkin math above obviously does not take into account that the RIs and instances are in all regions - so the pricing will be much different and by region... but it does illustrate, even by those 1500 RIs how much money can be wasted on under-utilized instances.<p>Netflix could start a service offering batch jobs to other companies to utilize capacity if they wanted. 12K instances unused for even an hour is going to be say, $6,000/hour that could potentially be wasted...",1443548869

You are not charging the presumed owner with a crime, nor accusing that person of a civil offense.  You are literally accusing an inanimate object of being involved in a crime.<p>For instance, you might charge a $20 bill with being used to buy methamphetamine.  So you take the $20 from the person who was holding it.  The identity or presumed innocence of that person is entirely irrelevant.  Then you set the $20 bill down at the defendant&#x27;s table in court and loudly accuse it of being a <i>very, very naughty</i> banknote, who ought to be punished severely, then reformed utterly by being spent for a righteous cause.  The judge then casts a severe gaze down upon the money from the bench, and asks the money if it has anything to say in its own defense.  Andrew Jackson remains mute.<p>Meanwhile, everyone else--those who had not been rendered permanently insane by their forfeiture classes in law school--look on and think to themselves &quot;WTF?  This is nucking futs.&quot;<p>The (former) owner of the $20 then has to prove that they have standing to represent the $20.  Then they have to prove its innocence, because it is not a human, or even a corporate fiction of a person, and therefore does not have the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.<p>Everyone outside the existing system sees it like this: the cops stole $20 from some guy, who was never convicted, or even charged with a crime.  Then they put him through the legal wringer before even giving him the opportunity to get it back.<p>A fine has an accused party, and the accuser has to show evidence that the accused was violating a law, regulation, contract, or some other agreement before that fine can be collected.  The fine would then be collected after the criminal conviction or civil judgment happened.<p>The logical place to use forfeiture is where no owner or presumed owner can be found, and there is clear evidence of criminal activity.  If you find an abandoned car with stolen plates and a missing VIN, and it had 20kg of cocaine and a stolen AR-15 in the trunk, the state would probably forfeit the car.  Anyone coming forward to claim ownership would presumably be charged criminally.  You only resort to <i>in rem</i> when no actual person can be found to take responsibility.<p>That makes some amount of sense.<p>Unfortunately, forfeiture has warped into a legal mechanism for highway robbery.",1443548730

The best-known example of this is the dangling else ambiguity: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_else"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_else</a><p>Sure, PEGs by definition are unambiguous, but only because they arbitrarily decide that the first option always &quot;wins.&quot;  The language itself might still be ambiguous, but you aren&#x27;t aware of it because the parser always chooses the first option.<p>Put another way, with PEGs you never know if:<p><pre><code>    a -> b / c;\n</code></pre>\nis equivalent to:<p><pre><code>    a -> c / b;\n</code></pre>\nYou also don&#x27;t know if there are rules that are entirely unreachable.<p>Besides this, packrat parsing (the PEG parsing algorithm) is significantly more expensive than LR/LR parsing. Packrat parsing takes O(input length) memory -- significantly more than the O(tree depth) space of LL/LR.<p>I talk more about these issues in my blog article: <a href=""http://blog.reverberate.org/2013/09/ll-and-lr-in-context-why-parsing-tools.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.reverberate.org/2013/09/ll-and-lr-in-context-why...</a>",1443548710

Even hacked a bit on G1: <a href=""http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/hotspot-gc-dev/2011-April/002452.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/hotspot-gc-dev/2011-A...</a><p>With a lot of effort by many folks in the community, HBase has mostly tackled the full-GC problem, but still has occasional issues with some workloads.<p>So, GC was definitely one factor - not having GC means we can give 99th percentile numbers in the single-digit milliseconds, which is pretty nice. Our master process actually has shown <1ms 99.99th percentile for tablet location requests on an 80 node cluster. So again, numbers that are super difficult to get on the JVM unless you take an allocation-free approach like the HFT guys do.<p>Another factor was ease of integration of platform-specific code for performance reasons. For example, we make use of SSE prefetch instructions to improve scan speed in our concurrent B-tree by 30% or so. The b-tree itself would be difficult to implement in Java due to lack of control over object layout, etc. While you can eventually get the same performance with enough off-heaping and sun.misc.Unsafe, my feeling is that, by the time you&#x27;ve gone down that road, you might as well be using C++.<p>I&#x27;ll admit that, after many years of not writing native code, I was a bit nervous of diving back in. Segfaults are never fun. But, we soon realized that the native code tooling has improved a _ton_ in the last decade. We run all of our tests precommit using the excellent Sanitizer tools from Google (ThreadSanitizer, AddressSanitizer, LeakSanitizer) and those make it nearly trivial to diagnose a leak or crash. We also have pretty strict guidelines around use of pointers, based on the Google C++ guidelines. Many will complain that this is a neutered form of C++, and they&#x27;re right. But it&#x27;s also a relatively safe form of C++.<p>I could probably write a lengthy blog post on our experiences of C++ vs Java, but hopefully the above gives you a taste. Overall I&#x27;ve been happy with the decision. Slightly more time spent on crashes. Less time spent on chasing hard-to-reproduce performance or memory consumption issues. And the thread checking tools are actually far superior, so I&#x27;d say less time spent chasing races.",1443548691

A monoculture of the same plants quickly strips the soil of essential nutrients and if you cannot identify those nutrients and aggressively resupply them, you will soon find that the trees you wanted to grow and harvest will no longer thrive and somnetimes will no longer survive. A forest can produce healthy trees for generations because of the diversity of plants growing therein. Different plants use different nutrients and some replenish the nutrients used by neighboring plants.<p>Obviously, software tools are not plants. But I have my suspicions that the diversity of code he describes developed in part for reasons like &quot;different engineers happened to be experienced with different languages, tools, etc&quot; but there may be cases in there where it developed that way because it was the best way to handle it. So when you start standardizing things, you may be killing off things that are critical to the health of the codebase and the company.<p>I can see value in having someone dedicated to serving the needs of the engineers so they can be more productive. I can see a need to clean things up. But complexity itself often has inherent value that cannot be replaced or improved upon with a simpler solution. Sometimes, simplifying things amounts to throwing the baby out with the bath water.

First is that when there are no tall tent poles (20 functions take 5% of the time each), people don&#x27;t know what to do, so they don&#x27;t do anything.  Second, and possibly easier to fix, is that people believe the perf analysis tool (the breakdown of where time is spent) is telling them the objective truth.  Often it&#x27;s wrong, which is why we try things, benchmark them, and revert changes if things get worse.<p>When there are no tall tent poles I switch to invocation count, which is the best secondary indicator of hotspots.  There was one method that the perf tool told me was taking 10% of the run time.  But the call count was fishy.  Due to a bad call structure it was being called far more often than necessary.  In the worst spot in the code two sequential calls were calling this function, so I flipped the code around so they could take the answer as an argument (memoization).<p>I reran the benchmarks.  I had removed 50% of calls to a function that took 10% of our time, and the code overall was now 20% (twenty percent!) faster.  Why?<p>Functions allocate memory.  They evict cache lines in the data and instruction caches.  They might even access constrained resources, like disk. And as you said, they change how the JIT decides to optimize things.<p>Sometimes, the symptom is that the code that runs immediately afterward gets blamed for problems they didn&#x27;t create, and the profiler has no way of following the problem back to the root cause, so it assigns blame at the point of contention, not at the start of the contention.<p>The only tools I&#x27;ve found that helps with this are clean coding practices, and figuring out if your invocation counts match your expectations (I will run a call tree 100 times and then compare the call counts of everything to find things that were called 2+ times as often as they strictly should have been called)",1443548241

However, the idea that we should learn math the way we learn languages has a flawed premise.  Human beings have been equipped by evolution with the capacity to acquire language by exposure.  Cognitively normal children aquire language, including the complexities of grammar, through simple exposure to people speaking that language during a particular period in their development.  It&#x27;s unfortunate that this ability doesn&#x27;t persist through life, or apply to more than one language for most people.  But for children, language acquisition is completely effortless.<p>This is not the case for other cognitive skills, such as reading and (to our point) mathematics.  My son cannot learn calculus simply by hanging out in my office.  While our end goal may be the sort of effortless intuition in mathematics that we experience in parsing complicated sentences, the process of acquiring those two skills is of necessity widely divergent.",1443548183

To me it&#x27;s really about building off of what a student already 1) knows conceptually (rules) and 2) has experienced (intuition).<p>What I&#x27;ve learned is that you can&#x27;t teach any type of rule until all it&#x27;s &quot;prerequisite phenomena&quot; has been <i>experienced</i>. Music education has a bias of more &quot;doing&quot; and experiencing and less &quot;talking&quot; about (or it should at least). So it has a keen way of turning ideas and concepts into action rather quickly. I think many other disciplines in school can learn a bit from how music is taught frankly: there is a very quick turnaround from concept to application/experience and therefore to emotional context of some sort, which really is the end goal to all learning. <i>Why do you care about X?</i><p>So if a rule simply is an equation of some sort, or a statement of relationships, then the prerequisite phenomena is making sure every variable is defined within it; so that one can focus solely on the relationships within the objects instead of the undefined variables. This covers many different grounds depending on the style of the learner and the material at hand. Sometimes (rarely) words are enough (if you&#x27;re building familiar rules into new rules and the experiential phenomena is all done in the mind &quot;ah-ha!&quot;) and usually, a student needs to hear the sound of a major scale vs a minor scale and try to describe it with words before telling them what actually makes it sound different theoretically. And even then, there are different ways to explain it. If the student picked up major scales really well (prerequisite phenomena), I will use the modal approach to learning minor scales (it&#x27;s the major scale but starting from a different note), if the student picks up the scale tones and is better with spacial relationships, they usually already talk about the differences between what they just played as a sharp/flat 6th or 7th scale tone. And there you have it, they&#x27;ve just instructed YOU how they think about a concept.<p>Music is a great example of how there is no single correct way to explain the theory. First off, music practice and artistic decisions <i>always</i> came first, the theory came later as people tried to understand and teach it. And it is the bias of educators to find a single correct way to understand it within themselves that leads to them only prescribing one way to do something (memorize this!).

It&#x27;s really not that different than the MPAA or RIAA, especially in that since we don&#x27;t like them, we feel justified in behavior that normally we wouldn&#x27;t take.  Does the RIAA being a shitty organization mean that we should steal (music) from their constituents, or that we should boycott them?

IMO, crime and low education levels are symptoms that feed back into the deeper social breakdown that happened.<p>So to illustrate one facet of the social breakdown: the implosion of local street-level business.<p>I grew up in Los Angeles during what was the worst period of time for its inner cities, around the riots and the aftermath. Lots of street businesses burned, and there was fear that there would be an investment implosion. Perhaps the business community would do what the police department did (yeah, they pulled out at the beginning of the riots). But instead, Los Angeles restored normalcy to its communities, thanks to solid leadership and general empathy. Jobs were still around, businesses continued and expanded even in the toughest parts of town. And that is why LA thrives even with its many more dangerous pockets.<p>Detroit outside of downtown was largely abandoned by its business community and &quot;city fathers&quot; (seems old fashioned to put it this way but it was the 1960s). You need more than a glitzy downtown, pristine museum, and freeways to have a functional society. On the street at the crucial moments of decision, it must have been rational thinking made by store owners to not invest or to move the store elsewhere. Maybe sprinkle some racism in there too. These local business folks must have sensed the direction of the wind.<p>The core &quot;powers that be&quot; were not helping, and clearly could not find a way to halt the white flight. Maybe it was unsolvable, but looking at the history it seems that the city fathers did not pull all stops on keeping Detroit&#x27;s population stable.<p>Add to that the huge loss of industrial jobs. In an economic sense, all that was left was downtown pushing big gov solutions like &quot;convention center&quot; and &quot;people mover&quot; and &quot;casino&quot;. Not to mention the GM plant and jail that destroyed half of what was Polish-town. Highly unsubtle solutions in the Pre-Gilbert era, most of which entirely ignored the importance of small, community-level business.<p>So problems have causes and it feeds back into the problems. Without eyes on the street by shopkeepers, you have crime. Without nearby jobs, families do not have time to help their kids through school.<p>The fix? Complicated.",1443546993

Keep in mind the EFF is a non-profit that caters to a certain audience primarily of non-lawyers.<p>So phrases such as:<p>&quot;The CFAA does not explain what &quot;without authorization&quot; actually means.&quot;<p>and<p>&quot;The amendment would make it much easier to prosecute anyone for trafficking in passwords or similar information through which a computer may be “accessed without authorization.” The amendment changes the mental state required to simply “knowing such conduct to be wrongful”&quot;<p>Sound plenty powerful/logical to the general public who is already inclined to support the EFF, not realizing: 1. As you mention &quot;knowing&quot; and/or &quot;knowledge&quot; is not just a term of art in law but an actual legal standard that has been defined and redefined through case law (same is true of willful, and reckless in a criminal context); and 2. All law as written (in a vacuum) has very little interpretation until a set of facts is applied to the law where a court may interpret the law setting precedent, much like the Nosal case you highlighted.  Just as an analogy, when talking about the 4th Amendment I could say the Founders wanted us to be free from &quot;unreasonable search and seizures&quot; and then tell the public how that is ripe for abuse because there is no definition of &quot;unreasonable&quot; in the Constitution...and I would technically be right, simultaneously ignoring 100+ years of case law which defines unreasonable as applied in 1,000&#x27;s of factual scenarios.",1443546963

Here's my story: take from it what you will.<p>2 years ago, I decided to get started with Lisp. I looked around, and the most ""official"" path seemed to be using ""Lisp Box"", which is Emacs based. I didn't have any experience with Emacs, but I did keep hearing about it, so I decided to jump in and learn it (I was, after all, in a learning mood).<p>Of course, learning Emacs isn't a one-day affair. Sure, I could learn enough to do some Lisp (and I did). But it feels like a waste. So I started to learn a bit more about Emacs. Then more. Eventually, I was spending so much energy learning Emacs, that I didn't have any time left to learn Lisp. To this day, I've never learned Lisp.<p>In contrast, with Python, I spent a day with the IDLE shell that comes packaged as part of Python. Then I moved on to working in files, with IDLE as an editor. Eventually, I moved on to looking for a good Python editor/IDE, a search I spent a lot of time on. But the point is, I didn't <i>need</i> to learn a completely new environment to use Python. Don't forget, a n00b only has so much time/energy to learn, you <i>don't</i> want them wasting it on the editor but on the language. The editor can always come later.",1277724542

When you go to conferences, you hear all the latest stories before they get written anywhere. You are ahead of everyone who didn't show up. Sure, bloggers will cover this or that rumor, but being there and having heard it all gives you an edge. Whether that edge will eventually be valuable depends of course.",1277723625

I can't tell you what ROI you'll get because I can't tell if you're going to sit in the back and read HN comments, or pay attention and take notes. I can't tell if you'll stare at the speakers without working up the nerve to say hello, or if you'll buy them a beer and strike up a conversation. Those things are beyond my control as an organizer.<p>But I can tell you that there is a tremendous amount of POTENTIAL ROI. That's how we designed the conference.<p>EDIT: By the way, do you think the only valuable thing is ""knowledge""? Cuz I bet you know what you have to do, but you're not doing it. That's not ""knowledge"" - all you need for ""knowledge"" is books. But <i>it</i> is something you can get from being around people who are doing exactly what you want to do, and hearing them tell war stories.<p>We have one speaker, who you've never heard of, who runs more than 3 SaaSes you've undoubtedly heard of. We have another who is just starting his SaaS journey now and I picked deliberately for his approachability. (But all others are living off their products.)<p>And then, of course, there's me - veteran procrastinator, one SaaS in the world, another couple in the oven, one ebook, multiple training courses, and a veteran speaker of many conferences and former committee member of OSCON.<p>Trust me - it's not possible that you've put more thought into questioning this type of event than I have.",1277723482

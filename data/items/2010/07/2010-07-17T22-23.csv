Amphetamine is basically the classic stimulant to which all others are compared. It is extremely common in competitive universities in the U.S. where many students use it to cram\finish papers. If you take it everyday, you will be very motivated and feel great for ~1 month, after which you are back to baseline concentration levels when on it until you take a break for a week. Amphetamine depletes magnesium and increases muscle tension. I personally find it only increases my efficiency on very repetitive tasks such as cleaning or doing laundry and hinders creative work by causing too much hyperfocus. I would not recommend it and think there are much better alternatives but your mileage may vary.",1279405745

I suspect a lot of people used an older version of Netbeans but after 6.7 it is probably the most well integrated IDE available for Java as well as an assortment of other languages.<p>Someone said the Javascript support was better in IntelliJ product and I just don't see that, Netbeans has better support for Javascript than ever Aptana Studio as well it supports the syntax of all of the major JS Toolkits from Dojo to jQuery.<p>Netbeans rivals Visual Studio when it comes to an well integrated environment that provides UI's for SQL / DB managment, HTML, CSS, XML, JSON, Server managment and is the first IDE that I did not feel like I was roughing it in since coming back to Java from doing some .NET work for a couple of years.",1279404150

For e.g. client-side applications, Ruby makes deployment painful, since everyone has their own versions of Ruby with different sets and versions of gems. Added to that, a lot of people are not allowed to install the necessary dependencies on work machines. And then, Windows has no such thing at all.<p>This is quite easy to fix on linux. You compile a your required version of ruby beside the application that needs it.<p><pre><code>    /srv/<application>
         src/
         ruby/ <-- install ruby here with the proper flags
         build-ruby.sh <--- custom script to download, build, and install ruby
</code></pre>
I've done this as a matter of principle my own server. It allows me to swap out what ruby version I run my app on without messing with the ruby installed on the system.<p>The bundler project is also trying to the gem problem by bundling gems with your application.",1279404047

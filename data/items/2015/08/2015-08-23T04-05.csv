It offers models that can sync up to your backend easily, and adds much needed structure to handlebar templates and jQuery.<p>If you feel like using React, it looks like it would be quite easy to use Backbone models in the same way Flux implementations are used (basically a data store w/ events).

Not sure it&#x27;s practical lol. Would be nice. One I found true, though, was this:<p>&quot;A less qualified young man, originally included, found our activities beyond his mental grasp and left the group. I mention this explicitly, because at least in Holland, the intellectual level needed for system design is in general grossly underestimated. I am more than ever convinced that this type of work is just difficult and that every effort to do it with other than the best people is doomed to either failure or moderate success at enormous expenses.&quot;<p>It seems especially true. Languages, compilers, OS&#x27;s, verification of the above... the stuff that seems to be the best has taken some bright people to come up with. Old papers on Orange Book A1 systems said they usually got done because they picked geniuses to build them. Google uses the same model to come up with things like MapReduce and F1 DBMS far as I can tell. However, as A1 papers said, geniuses are in short supply. Oh, what to do...?<p>I think the prior work and 80/20 rule give the answer: leverage geniuses to build tools and methods that make it almost trivial for the rest to apply them correctly. Good examples are the capability-secure OS&#x27;s making POLA easy, languages such as Ocaml knocking out tons of issues, parsing systems like LANGSEC, middleware like ZeroMQ, web runtimes like Opa (or Cornell&#x27;s SWIFT), processors like SAFE (crash-safe.org), fault-tolerance like NonStop, and so on. Each is easy enough to learn to use day-to-day while knocking out most of the tough problems users will encounter. And each could be designed, implemented, and verified/validated by elite developers.<p>The success of tools such as Ada, Oberon, Java, Eiffel, and Python in eliminating entire classes of problems shows us the approach works. Just gotta make it even better, put the brightest on it, and absolutely make sure it&#x27;s marketable to the rest. Ada, LISP, and Wirth languages&#x27; adoption showed last part is critical. Plus... (rolls eyes)... probably needs a bullet-proof, usable C/C++ or Java FFI. Can always have geniuses in metaprogramming convert all that shit later. ;)",1440304741

Instead, you&#x27;re forced into using existing structured-flow constructs in very weird ways, or extra state variables and the code to handle them.

I don&#x27;t mind the service, but my first love was SQLite (thanks to Android, and Python), and my second love was JSON (partly why I ended up choosing the database, and switched to the NoSQL database). Some of this is probably slightly off-topic, but since I <i>love</i> the product, I would very happily use SQLite once again if for:<p>1) JSON support, as is being offered as described in the post. I want to do the following in SQLite (look to MongoDB(!) documentation for syntax):
    a) Inserts. You know, regular inserts.
    b) Upserts. The &#x27;hated&#x27; database (Mongo, obvs) has this easily-configurable upsert [&#x27;replacements&#x27;?], that&#x27;s incredibly easy to use.
    c) Bulk upserts, inserts and deletes.<p>2) Cheap-ish online database that you can probably use Amazon S3 for, which I am going to make my institution (University/employer) pay for anyway. Things I care for are: a) you take care of all the deployment details and provide support when I need one and b) don&#x27;t throw me off your service when I cross your limits because I&#x27;ve overused them because I&#x27;m a data-hoarder but I&#x27;ll lose my life&#x27;s worth of work if you throw me off your service.<p>I would also love it if your offered a choice of setting up couple of indexes very easily (using JSON, obvs), and offered a visual explorer of data in the database (relevant because a <i>certain</i> mongo service offers an awesome data explorer).<p>Please understand that a very large majority of your users is <i>NOT</i> doing complex joins or using other advances features of the database. As an engineer, I would <i>love</i> it if my users used the most advanced features and let me code the funnest, cutting-edge algorithms, but that&#x27;s not what I want as a user. All I ask is simple inserts, deletes, upserts, an online service to handle them, and an ability to do this all using JSON. This is not going to make the most exciting days of your work-life, but I would be an extremely happy person if I were able to use these services.<p>Sidenote: Since I may never have chance to an SQLite person again, I&#x27;ll bring this up even though this is likely WAY off-topic. I am a researcher who likes to HOARD data. I like storing data in my Uni&#x27;s server, that has a limit on file size/total size. <i>IF</i> you created the ability to store the same database across several files, I would be most grateful to you.<p>PS: Love your documentation, guys.

In general, asking questions that cannot be falsified/validated experimentally isn&#x27;t useful in science, hence they don&#x27;t really matter to us.<p>A physical (or scientific) theory is such that you get more than you put into it. Newton&#x27;s F=ma and inverse square law didn&#x27;t just explain the motion of Venus, it explained and extremely wide range of phenomena and gave rise to thermodynamics, heat engines and fluid dynamics among many many other things.
That it predicts new testable phenomena. Maxwell equations uncovered the link between magnetism, electricity and light (things that apparently have nothing to do with each other --but they do, and speed of light is related to permittivity and permeability), and eventually gave rise to special relativity. Quantum mechanics predicted --among many many other things-- anti-particles, superfluidity, superconductors. Mayan priests didn&#x27;t have this. Physical theories do. &quot;Spooky action at distance&quot; is also an example of this, and it is something falsifiable, and its existence is experimentally confirmed. Nobody is saying we don&#x27;t understand it or it doesn&#x27;t matter. It is a just part of reality, and (non-relativistic) quantum mechanics.<p>That model you&#x27;re referring to is called quantum mechanics, and it has been refined by quantum field theory.<p>You can&#x27;t prove a scientific theory either way. There are physical laws that work within a certain domain. They just agree with observations. Until we observe something strange that requires a more refined theory, which however reproduces the old theory within the old domain (because it actually worked). For example, when the speed of light is much greater than any speed, you recover Newton&#x27;s laws from special relativity and general relativity. When the action is large in comparison to the Planck constant, quantum mechanics turns into classical mechanics. When the mass density is small, general relativity becomes Newtonian gravity. And so on.<p>General relativity and quantum field theory will eventually be replaced by something that will (hopefully) explain what&#x27;s going on inside a black hole, what is dark matter/energy, and so on.",1440303080

    void run()

&quot;volatile&quot; is the most precise way to prevent the compiler from hoisting the &#x27;interrupted&#x27; access out of the loop. Memory barriers aren&#x27;t necessary, because the code is single threaded. They may effectively defeat the optimization too, but it&#x27;s by confusing the compiler instead of informing it.<p><i>edit</i>: Oh, and std::atomic is a very bad solution to the above. std::atomic may take locks, which can lead to a deadlock if used in a signal handler!",1440302603

Man, I'm amazed at the bitching here... Someone's trying to help foster startups in europe! The horror!  There's no way it can be decent, right?  Jesus.....<p>Its not like the idea of doing early stage funding is that new, nor is the idea of havign an application form new.  Ok, so the questions may not be original-- but that's flattery, its not like the YC form is a trade secret! <p>Getting startups together for a fixed period in a fixed place is relatively new, and seems to be a YC idea.  Ok, so what does it mean when others emulate this?  IT means they think its a good idea!  How does this hurt YC?<p>YC is evangelizing a different approach to early stage funding.  Now others are emulating the idea-- there is no way in hell that this can be a bad thing!<p>This is called success!<p>Do y'all who were rejected by YC hate the fact that there are now other options?<p>Or do you think that these people are going to steal all the ""good"" startups from YC diminishing their pool?",1177241237
15685,comment,15684,15684,0,0,BitGeek,,,"This article highlights an area of confusion, I think.  Of course, any new business is a startup.  So, even your aunts diner that is opening soon is a startup.<p>But when we talk about a ""startup"" here generally we're talking about a technology startup, or mroe specifically, a web oriented technology startup.<p>But we're not necessarily talking about: Funding, organization, theoretical growth rates, etc, for that company.<p>So, I think the term ""lifestyle business"" should be banned or rejected by this community.  Its a derogatory term used to apply to people who are chosing to go a different path, with the implicit assumption that that path is lame (eg: low growth, low chance of getting rich.) <p>There are certainly a lot of choices that founders have to make with regards to whether they are building a real business or not (EG: something sustainable that will make them rich even if a $10B+ company doesn't buy them in 24 months... rather than something that's a feature built to flip to someone with a real product offering.) ... and funding, location, team size, team composition (eg: when to hire marketing or sales people), etc are all independant of whether you're building a business.<p>You could bootstrap a company built to flip, or you could use VC money to do it.  You can use VC money to build a real business, or you can bootstrap a real business.<p>But I believe, strongly, that building a real business is the only way to go-- its the most likely path to getting flipped, and its the way you will end up with something more than an adrenaline hangover after 24 months. <p>I hope this is making sense... <p>In summary, focusing on the business is the path to success... and recognizing all of these choices (including who to take money from) have advantages and disadvantages for the business case.  For instance, one option might make great short term financial sense but be damaging in the long term-- if its a build to flip situation then you don't care about the long term.  But in making that choice, you're risking the flip taking longer than expected....<p>So, build a business.<p>PS-- Justification for this long post: I was recently talking to a startup, and they are totally focused on being acquired within the next 18 months.  Thats their plan.  Their only plan.  Every decision they make is with that assumption, and they are going to be in a world of pain 24 months from now if they aren't acquired in that time period.  Worse, I think that if the followed a the right strategy, between 18 and 48 months from now they'd grow from a $250M business to a $4B business.",1177240213

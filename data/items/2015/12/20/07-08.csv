Because they knew it was backdoored, they replaced the NSA key with their own, which they thought made it &quot;safe.&quot;<p>Now it turns out that a third actor might have somehow replaced the Juniper key with their own key.<p>The point is that by using a CSPRNG with a backdoor, even when they tried to close that backdoor, they still left a backdoor open. Dual_EC is relevant because if the USG had never promoted it there never would have been a backdoor to leave open. Another CSPRNG would have been harder to leave insecure.<p>> If this back door only works by assuming Dual EC is backdoored, is that not incontrovertible proof that the NSA is behind the entire thing, which there is at least some doubt that they are?<p>Not necessarily.

Similarly even if a claim seems superficially similar to the kind of claim made by non-credulous people, that&#x27;s far from conclusive evidence for it being an invalid claim.</i><p>You&#x27;re right, that&#x27;s not a very strong form of argument.

It is not statically typed, but it is internally more unified and consistent. With some exceptions, you only get to see ugly compatibility compromises when you need to interact with Java code.<p>(1) Rust is compatible with C - in fact, it interoperates with other languages that have C FFIs by simply pretending to be C. Nevertheless, outside of specifically designated `unsafe` blocks, which idiomatic Rust only uses sparingly, most code is written in a &quot;modern C++ meets ML&quot; style.<p>> But I&#x27;d take types with class-vs-trait design choices, less-than-ideal match exhaustiveness checks, and type inference incompleteness any day over a language lacking <i>all</i> static typing features.<p>Static typing is a useful feature, but I think it&#x27;s narrow-minded to use it as the only criterion for judging a language&#x27;s merits. For instance, Clojure&#x27;s macros are objectively nicer than Scala&#x27;s, even if both pale in comparison to Racket&#x27;s. Writing multimethods in Clojure is straightforward once you know the syntax, whereas emulating multiparameter type classes in Scala can be confusing unless you know the specifics of how implicit parameters are resolved. (This is, ironically, a direct consequence of Scala&#x27;s richer type system.)",1450595424

It&#x27;s not piece work. Adding more people to a late project only makes it <i>later</i>, as the existing dev team has to work to bring the new hires (even if they&#x27;re experienced developers, they&#x27;re still new to the project) up to speed. Adding more resources to a late project, without accounting for a period of reduced productivity is the absolute worst thing management can do. I have literally seen projects go from, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s borderline, but we can deliver if we work weekends,&quot; to, &quot;There is no way we can do this by the delivery date,&quot; because management decided to add two new developers to the team.<p>The worst thing is, Fred Brooks published a book talking about this phenomenon in the &#x27;70s: <i>The Mythical Man Month</i>.

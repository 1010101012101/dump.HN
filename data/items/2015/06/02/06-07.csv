9644314,comment,9641729,9644016,0,0,fpgaminer,,,"> It&#x27;s actually more comparable to designing a pipelined CPU than it is to assembly language, IMO.<p>In a way, yeah.  But the 6502 was also quite constrained, and early systems further constrained it (e.g. the Atari 2600 only have 128 bytes of RAM).  I think this game does a good job of emulating the amount of creative thinking programmers had to have to deal with the limits of those early machines.  And the game does so while keeping things simple so you aren&#x27;t spending your evening glazing over a 300 page 6502 programmer&#x27;s manual.<p>Regarding level 7, definitely a tough one!  I ended up making what looks like the first solution with 4 nodes and 22 instructions.  It&#x27;s possible to cram the logic into one node, with some misc. decoding in a second and the other two as just transports.<p>Back to your point, this isn&#x27;t exactly like working with older, consumer computers like the Apple II, mostly because of the parallelism.  I think that&#x27;s because of Zachtronics&#x27; other games which involve a lot of data-driven, parallel engineering.  Still fun though; well worth the $7.",1433228179

It assumes no change in production, just that everything stays the same. (It also assumes no recycling.)<p>But in the real world when there is a shortage people find new sources, figure out alternatives, recycle more, and tons of other things. Like I said several times: Humans create resources when they need them.<p>> You started with how we can&#x27;t ever run out of resources, and then you added the proviso<p>I didn&#x27;t add it, energy was explicit from the start. We don&#x27;t have to harness energy from other galaxies, our own home planet has tons, and the sun has far more. The &quot;universe&quot; part is just to say we&#x27;ll never run out even if it goes short on our planet in the distant future, ignore that part if it bothers you, it&#x27;s not necessary.<p>> In the actual world, where we don&#x27;t have this unlimited tappable energy at hand at the moment (and with the limitations of energy production methods) we can very much run out of resources.<p>No. We can not run out. You keep underestimating people. If we need it, we&#x27;ll make it. You don&#x27;t need unlimited energy, just a finite amount.<p>Look at water in Israel - 20 years ago they had a shortage, now, they have an abundance. Why? Because they needed it, so they figured out how to make driking water.<p>If we run short of energy, we&#x27;ll find a new way to make it. All that is required is the the need. There are tons of untapped energy sources, many of them environmentally clean.<p>Why don&#x27;t we tap them now? Because we don&#x27;t need to. That&#x27;s all.",1433227867

9644285,comment,9643054,9643313,0,0,jacquesm,,,"A thorough review of a software production is <i>not</i> an insanely rigorous pile of paperwork. I think I&#x27;m going to have to disagree with you about the kind of caution that we can draw from this incident, in fact I think cases like these should be mandatory study material for anybody that makes or moves into making software for critical applications.<p>I&#x27;ve built some stuff controlling machinery that would amputate your arm in a split second and &#x27;faster release cycles&#x27; would have caused accidents, not better quality.<p>Exhaustive testing, thorough review and extensive documentation of not only the code but also the reasoning behind the code saved my ass more than once from releasing something in production that would have likely caused at a minimum a serious accident.<p>One of my rules for writing machinery controlling software is that <i>I</i> determine when a new piece of software can be taken out of my hands to be passed up the chain. The only time someone violated that rule this happened:<p>It was around 6 pm when we finished working on the control software of a large lathe, a Reiden machine with a 16&#x27; bed and a 2&#x27; chuck. I put the disks with the new version on the edge of my desk for &#x27;air&#x27; (machine otherwise not powered up), &#x27;wood&#x27; and &#x27;aluminum&#x27; testing the next day. In simulation it all looked good but it&#x27;s easy to make mistakes.<p>When I walked back onto the shop floor the next morning it was deadly quiet. My boss was sitting in his office upstairs and I asked him what was up. He&#x27;d taken those disks to do a &#x27;quick demonstration&#x27; for a prospect before I arrived to show them a new feature (thread cutting iirc). A subtle bug caused the machine to start cutting with a feed of 10mm instead of 1mm, the stainless steel he used for the demo got cut up into serrated carving knives spinning out of the machine at very high speed. Amazingly, nobody had gotten wounded or killed, mostly due the power of the Reiden (it never even stalled) and the holding force of the chuck (which had to keep hold of the workpiece during all that violence), the machine had actually completed its cycle and the customer had left &#x27;most impressed&#x27; (and probably a few shades paler than they arrived...). They actually bought the machine on the strength of the demo and some showmanship of my boss, cheeky bastard, for all the same money there would have been a couple of ambulances in front of the building that day.<p>After that nobody ever tried to use any of the binaries until I had signed off on them on as &#x27;safe for production&#x27;.<p>That mistake would have definitely been caught in the &#x27;wood&#x27; testing phase and a &#x27;faster release cycle&#x27; would have missed it entirely since it <i>looked</i> very good right up to the moment where the cutting bit hit the metal.<p>Test protocols exist for a reason, skip them and you&#x27;re playing with fire, faster release cycles are great for non-critical software.",1433227695

9644264,comment,9643204,9643808,0,0,lifekaizen,,,"I worked in new auto development at Toyota (Japan) for four years in mid 2000s, right before this happened. The unintended acceleration problem has also perplexed me, because in my experience any safety issue was always given top priority. But I did experience limited familiarity with software/firmware. Usually that was looked at as part of the component, for example the engine control module in it&#x27;s physical plastic housing. Remember the production auto will have Denso (or similar) delivering that ECU to the factory as an &quot;assembly&quot; and hundreds or thousands of these are assembled into the car and function together. At the end of the assembly line, various tests are run on the system and vehicle, but these appear to be of the &quot;input/output&quot; that someone else described. So why isn&#x27;t software done better?<p>I&#x27;d say one problem is the testing process is not robust enough for software/firmware as it is for mechanicals. The tests revolve around driving the car, and variations on driving, and have evolved over years and decades. Heavy software control is newer, and in my experience was often not fully understood. Chief Engineers tend to come from mechanical. And there are always hundreds of problems to solve and limited time, and the black-box nature of firmware makes it hard to develop tests for.<p>A development review meeting tends include various mechanical departments, like Drivetrain or Engine or Chassis, many times they bring physical prototypes to the meeting and the problems and proposed solutions are comprehensible. The build testing procedures subject the car/parts to various mechanical tests, and long-lead tests are performed which stress parts till breaking. It&#x27;s something you develop experience with an can get your head around.<p>Firmware bugs are not like that -- having just gone through this with my current consumer electronics startup I experienced the black box component first hand. I remember one software based problem we reviewed at Toyota, where something happened like: when the car has been sitting for >3 hours at <50F weather, and the ignition is started when the car is at a 15 degree angle (side of road) and driven on to a flat plane within 15 seconds, the &quot;check engine&quot; light turns on. Even though we had no test for that, we heard about it for customer complaints came through. But the fix is to have the supplier (in this case, but could be the Toyota engineer) fix that problem, with most of the discussion centered on timing and certainty of fix. I don&#x27;t remember any discussions about global variables or lines of code.",1433227417

Let alone a case of runaway acceleration which the driver is unable to stop with the brakes (requiring a simultaneous brake failure). Since the accelerator pedals in these Toyota vehicles have been pressed no fewer than tens of trillions of times in recent years, that&#x27;s not an appalling safety record at all. In fact, stuck pedals (whether due to bad lubricants or rolled-up floor mats) are many orders of magnitude more likely to cause stuck throttle than software failures, while runaway vehicles (ones with brakes not working either) are generally caused by &quot;pedal misapplication&quot;, i.e. stomping on the gas instead of the brakes.<p>The fact that software has an execution pathway leading to something bad does not mean that this pathway can ever be entered, since in a closed realtime system like this, it is not possible to receive every combination of inputs, unlike in a system loading user data from a file.

I picked it up quickly enough to get good grades (at one point was 2nd in my GCSE English class, lol).<p>- at UCAS time (&quot;pick your uni&quot;), my tutor (this being a good school) pressured me into applying to these Oxbridge universities I never heard of. I got something like 7 mock interviews from various teachers so accidentally aced the entrance interview. I was good at maths and my country likes engineers so I did engineering (another sort of random choice).<p>- A prof was looking for someone to work in India for a few months, I applied, got it by virtue of being the only one out of 44 classmates who wanted to go. This gave me a taste for working out of comfort zone.<p>- after graduation, a friend introduced me to a banker in a country I won&#x27;t name with a very strict visa policy, where I might have worked illegaly on starting a bank. He didn&#x27;t manage to start it so back I went at the expiry of my visa.<p>- he sent me a link to the consulting firm&#x27;s JD, I applied more out of automatism than anything, and my perfect English and prestigious university impressed them or something. I actually interviewed in a different office to the one I should have gone to. Anybody working in consulting in Switzerland needs to master both English and either French, Italian or German. Short supply of that + good uni I guess, so I got the job.<p>- I applied to over 200 banks and financial institutions. The crisis made it hard. So many interviews. The trading job was one of the few that went to final stage (another one had a whopping 17 interviews). I was interested in global macro/FX so moved into that space internally mostly because nobody else from my intake was as interested.<p>- some guy called me a cold winter asking me if I wanted to move to Australia, so I said yes, quit my trading job and tried to learn to code.<p>Every step is, technically, random.

They are not on track to retire at 40.<p>I&#x27;ve also noticed that it&#x27;s always people with money who say, &quot;don&#x27;t be motivated only by money&quot;. Easy to say. It&#x27;s called &quot;compensation&quot; because it exists to compensate you for doing something you otherwise wouldn&#x27;t be doing.

And if they doubt your numbers, you give them a 500 page booklet in size 8 font and say &quot;it&#x27;s all here, you&#x27;re welcome to double check!&quot; knowing full well they don&#x27;t have the time.<p>I made several slides with over 300 PowerPoint &quot;objects&quot;. I think it was a set of 20 things which were sliced by 10 metrics each of which had its own little circle with a text box inside and different formatting. Didn&#x27;t know how to make that as a table so they insisted on the circles and text boxes approach. Took me about an hour a slide I think including all the aligns.<p>The audience for the stuff you produce is the client. If it&#x27;s the board of directors, they have an hour a week to check progress and hear recommendations. The more you bury them under noise, the more CYA you provide them to say you had all the data to back your recommendation. The best consultants actually manage to convince you that whatever decision they reach was the sound one.<p>I found much of the same cognitive biases - particularly regarding significance, and saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; - in management later. People simply don&#x27;t care to learn basic stats or think about what they are doing as making a model of the world and then taking decisions based on it.",1433224905

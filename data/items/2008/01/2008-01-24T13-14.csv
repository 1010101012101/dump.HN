Help with the fact that I have friends and family and maybe that special someone?

Not sure about that.<p>I don't know what generation you're in, but I do know that the past 10 years or so have been a breeze compared to what was before.  So, if you don't remember the early 90's, or especially the 70's (they really sucked!), be prepared for a change.<p>I sure hope you have full time work (or a nice business) and come through this OK.

103443,comment,103301,103301,0,0,bootload,,,"I remember my Dad telling me about my grandfather in the depression. He was born about the turn of the century and ran an EE shop, wiring up businesses in the busy manufacturing centre of Aus, Melbourne. He was in his 20/30's when the depression hit. Out on the streets one day, a man happened to come up to him and ask if he could have the <i>""core""</i> of the apple he was eating.<p>His reply? <i>""No. I'm going to eat it all. There will be no core""</i>.<p><i>""... I really don't see the point of that article.  ...""</i><p>When I read this comment, it tells me the reader hasn't registered that the rules have just changed.  Drastically. [0] Just like depression story above where something seemingly as worthless as an apple core could be someone else's only opportunity.<p>The era of cheap finance is over. [1]  Businesses are now in survival mode.  So trying to convince them to part with money has now become a whole lot harder. If you have a job, you can loose it, through no fault of your own. If you don't have a job, getting one that you like might become very difficult indeed.  Especially if the industry you are working in is hit financially hard. Innovative thinking is out. Rationalisation is in.<p>The suits are going to hit back at the <i>""smart-arse""</i> 20yo's who are well paid, wear shorts & t-shirts to work, read their favourite web2.0 websites and get in late... regardless if they do the job well. Because they can! [2]<p>For business, a new mindset is now required to operate. Spruiking to everyone you have lots of users instead of paying customers tells everyone you are most likely bleeding cash and therefore avoid your business. Cash is king. Debt is now un-sexy. [3] The price of doing business should get cheaper.<p>Good news for startups. The point of the article is simple. Remind those who have forgotten and those who have yet to experience a recession, the rules have all changed.<p>Adapt your thinking accordingly.<p>[0] You could argue the basics of business don't really change and any fool can make money in a boom.<p>[1] For the time being. Recessions don't last for ever.<p>[2] Read here for details ~

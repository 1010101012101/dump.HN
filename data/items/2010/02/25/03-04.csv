1149969,comment,1148437,1149470,0,0,yequalsx,,,"Because it means that we end up producing more Ph.D's than can be supported by the job market.  It leads to a glut of Ph.D's.   The lower cost does not mean that taxpayers get more bang for their buck.  The low cost has bad consequences.  Right now, in areas like physics, mathematics, etc. it's simply not worth it to get an advanced degree.  Also, increasing the supply of graduate students leads to a denigration of standards.<p>There are very bad long term consequences when a society is such that getting an advanced degree is not economically worthwhile.  It typically takes 7 years to get a Ph.D. in mathematics.  Pay is low during this time and usually have no benefits.  It takes another 4 - 7 years to get a tenure track position and getting such a position is hard.  A person is economically better off doing something else.<p>It is immoral to make people an indentured servant.  This is the current setup we have in our university system.  This is particularly true for poor people.<p>Our greatest generation was great because they largely had free higher education.  We took a generation of people and paid for them to get degrees if they could get into school and finish.  This was of great benefit to society. We gone from this model to the current model where a person pays for the chance to get a piece of paper in the hopes of getting a nicer paying job.  For many, they end up being slaves to their debt and don't end with the nicer paying job.  It's an immoral system.",1267070388

Well, for instance, if I'm understanding correctly what Friel claims, it's something like this: Lomborg makes lots and lots of citations; their relation to the material they're cited in support of is often unclear; it often turns out that they don't in fact support what he's saying. If that's true, then fact-checking him would be a lot of work because of the many citations, and the vagueness of reference that would require more work per citation, and the (hypothetical) fact that often the citations are no good. (Failed searches usually take longer than successful ones.)<p>Begley doesn't claim to be offering analysis. It's a book review. Do you seriously think it would have been appropriate for the review to be twice as long in order to go into more detail on each claim it mentions?<p>Anyway. You say Lomborg addresses ""each of Friel's claims made in the book review"" (weird way of putting it, btw). OK, let's look at the first one: what's happening to the population of polar bears. Well, er, the word ""bear"" doesn't appear in Lomborg's rebuttal. There's a bit about populations of penguins; nothing about polar bears. Oh. Next: heat deaths and cold deaths. There is certainly some discussion of this in Lomborg's rebuttal, but he doesn't seem to have anything to say about one of the most striking claims Begley says Friel makes: that Lomborg cites a study from 2006 as showing that global warming will save 1.4 million lives that would otherwise be lost to deaths from cold, when in fact the figure claimed in that study is 850k. Next: stuff about the Larsen B ice shelf. No occurrence of ""Larsen"" or ""shelf"" in Lomborg's rebuttal.<p>Your claim that Lomborg addresses every claim of Friel's that's found in the book review appears to be totally false. Did <i>you</i> read Lomborg's rebuttal, or did you just hope I wouldn't?<p>Incidentally #1: Why the quotation marks around ""distasteful""? That word is yours, not Begley's (still less Friel's). Begley used a different term.<p>Incidentally #2: Why the quotation marks around ""analysis""? My best guess is that it's because I used that word. But I used it about Friel's 272-page book, not Begley's 2ish-page review.<p>Incidentally #3: Why ""book review / editorial""? It says ""Book review"" at the top.

Right now, that standard is pretty ugly, and its pretty hard to go from that to something that looks decent. There's no reason someone writing a scientific application, or someone who can't afford a good designer, or doesn't understand the importance of design, should have no other option than something that looks pretty poor. The goal of a good standard is to allow applications to look really good out of the gate, which doesn't prevent you from then customizing it.<p>Look at Mac OS X for desktop and iPhone.

1149886,comment,1149555,1149555,0,0,carbon8,,,"I've been deep in cafe culture for almost 20 years now (hanging out in them since I was just starting high school, and now I've been working from cafes and home for 3 years), mainly in the Chicago area.<p>There was a big transition over the past 10 years when coffee shops went from being smoking establishments mainly catering to young people and people on the fringes to being places where a wide demographic of people meet to talk and, for many people, work on computers. Laptops + wireless breathed new life into independent coffee shops at a time when they were being hit with smoking bans and still licking their wounds from a decade of starbucks expansion.<p>The transition to wireless has created a thriving cafe culture that's more busy than I've ever seen it. The cafes around me are so packed all day every day that I have to time my arrival to make sure I get a seat. 10 years ago they were mostly empty during the day. And it's not just more customers, it's better customers. Schizophrenics who sat with a single cup of coffee for hours while harassing other customers have been replaced by young professionals who buy double lattes.<p>The vast majority of coffee shops that didn't embrace or take seriously the transition to wireless have lost all of their customers and closed. It's been somewhat heartbreaking for me to watch some of my favorite coffee shops sit empty and eventually close down because the owners didn't take the wireless transition seriously and/or because they held on to an imaginary ideal about cafe culture.<p>Turning it off on weekends makes some sense; people aren't working there as much. However, it's a dangerous idea for cafe owners to take the anti-wireless sentiment too far. It reminds me of when I worked in academic libraries during the period they were still holding on to their luddite fantasies about the role of libraries. If you own a cafe and are considering this, you better make damn sure that your cafe has enough of these ideal, laptopless customers. I've seen a lot of cafes gamble on this and lose.<p>All that said, it's interesting that wireless has made coffee shops so popular that people once again value them as social centers.",1267067183
1149884,comment,1148157,1149706,0,0,ecoffey,,,"Here is how I (try) and explain it to my coworkers when they say ""svn branches as well"".<p>You are right.  Svn can branch.  Can.  But branching in svn is always a dangerous proposition.  There are a lot of mechanics involved with branching it right initially, making sure that branch is properly tracking Trunk (you have to constantly merge from Trunk down into the branch to hedge the bets on eventually merging that branch back into Trunk).  Properly merging a big branch into Trunk is also an undertaking, and more importantly, it requires the whole team to know its happening and ""Be careful checking stuff in for I AM MERGING"".<p>Also branches in svn aren't private.  Anyone can see them.  They are private by convention sure.<p>So compare all that workflow with a DVCS.  The branching is free.  It happens <i>all the time</i> and you <i>never notice it</i>.  The merging is smarter, because it has to be, and the history is more complete, because it has to be to enable the merging.<p>When you do consciously branch it's a quicker, more robust operation.  Doing big scary feature branch merges isn't as scary since they're happening privately before you push back to the (culturally defined) central repo.  Yes you still have to merge from ""trunk"" to branch in DVCS but, again, it's a baked in feature since thats how you pull changes from someone else (for example in git you fetch changes from the central repo into remotes/master and then merge them into your master.  Same operation as merging master into feature branch, or branch into master).<p>Yes you can walk to San Francisco from New York.  But you can also Fly.<p>That's the end of my rant.

2133838,comment,2133355,2133610,0,0,dkarl,,,"Here's what the article said:  <i>A student who started a chapter of Global Zero at his university hasn't really thought about whether a world in which great powers have divested themselves of nuclear weapons would be more stable or less so, or whether nuclear deterrence can ever be moral.</i><p>Since when does thought equal equivocation?  Thoughtless action is irresponsible no matter what motivates it.  The author also faulted a student who signed up to kill for the government without wondering whether there was anything worth killing for.<p>The only thing I disagree with in the article is the one-sided concentration on the students who are just eager to do what they're told.  What about the ones who are more thoughtful?  Who are they, where do they come from, and why are they different from their Ritalin-addled robot achiever peers?",1295830707

Most interesting to me is they are going to do like WSJ.com and allow unlimited access for search engine referrals. That makes it easy for savvy readers to read whatever they want, but hard to link to. That's a bad strategy to get links/attention online.",1295830682

2133830,comment,2133189,2133189,0,0,fingerprinter,,,"Background: I started programming Java in 1996 or somewhere around there. I was a huge advocate of Java over things like C/C++ for quite a long time and I believe in early 2000 it was the best choice. I no longer believe Java is the best choice for most projects as there are saner alternatives out there including Scala, Clojure and Jruby (for the JVM) and other languages/VMs altogether if you want out of the JVM.<p>Bottom line: Java seems dated.<p>Now, to my rant.<p>import java.util.*;
interface Sortable<T, U extends Comparable<? super U>>  extends List<T>  {
   void sortBy(Extractor<? super T, ? extends U>  e) default Impl.sortBy;
   static class Impl {
       public static<T, U extends Comparable<? super U>>
                 void sortBy(Sortable<T, U>  sortable, final Extractor<? super T, ? extends U>  e) {
           Collections.sort(sortable, #{T a, T b ->  e.extract(a).compareTo(e.extract(b))});
       }
   }
}<p>I HATE this code. This is an example of when Java went downhill to me and started to get really, really ugly. I always thought Java was verbose, but with generics and others things it started to get ugly. That was enough for me. I knew Python and Ruby and decided to go a different way. Found Erlang and Clojure started to mature on the JVM. Bye bye Java.",1295830529

I am not sure I ever will finish it.  If things pan out, I'm okay with that.  But it is something of an annoyance and I have basically been told it hurts me at work.

First: I'm not referring to you as a naysayer, just trying to clarify the timeline (both expected and perceived). No - your comments were far from the single catalyst for his post, months of comments built up to that comment, so don't worry - none of this, or that, was a personal attack against you.<p>I concur - the <a href=""http://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3</a> page needs to be more prominent. I think the entire download page needs to be junked, and completely rethought out, but I, not anyone else I know have the time or the constitution to do it.<p>So yes, the download page <i>could be better</i> - but I don't know anyone willing to change it.<p>How would <i>you</i> communicate it? Python-dev is public, the plans and designs of Python 3 are open. The lists are open for questions, and I don't know of a single core developer who would not take the time to answer questions. We've made it as public as possible, and reiterated it at every single PyCon, in every blog post we could, etc.<p>I completely disagree that this is a poor time to get started with python. There is no confusion: Use Python 2 unless you can use Python 3. I use python2 every day, and have no intention of switching to 3 in production before Django and several other things port over.<p>The python community (see PEPs, the moratorium, web-sig discussions) moves relatively slowly. We get something that works and then we slowly begin to move towards something else. A lot of discussion, and a lot of thought goes into each step.<p>For example, yes: the general release was necessary - we need an official release for people to even pay attention. We need an official release for OS distributions to even <i>consider</i> picking it up and shipping it <i>alongside</i> existing Python 2 installs.<p>Yes, the fact that a choice has to be made sucks: but we, those of us in ""core"" can do nothing but encourage and help with porting where we can, the PSF can sponsor sprints, and we can bide our time.<p>As for the length of time to get PEP 3333 accepted? Go look at the web-sig archives to find out way. No decision in the community is made without intense and thorough debate.<p>Finally, I can understand your frustration - its frustrating I have to keep repeating myself because this confusion exists. But I can sum my opinion really simply: Use Python 2.7 until more libraries and frameworks port.<p>Everyone is open to how we can improve communication: but we're also short on resources. I do what I can commenting in places like here, and trying to explain to people who don't know.<p>So, I hope that this ""confusion"" isn't hurting adoption: we've tried to explain things time and time again, only time and framework/tool and libraries authors porting can help at this point.",1295829021

Quora might still be good because it hasn't yet reached it.<p>eBay used to be good as well, then one day they got so big that buyers and sellers were practically left to settle their disputes on their own. eBay used to be my #1 stop for anything that I wanted to buy online. After getting burnt 2 or 3 times, I haven't opened a page on the site in over a year and haven't bought anything from it in the last 3.<p>I'm also going to make the bold claim that if Facebook was in its current state 3 or 4 years ago, in terms of quality and community, it would probably not have gotten the success it currently enjoys. Most of us would just consider it another MySpace or HI5 clone.<p>As far as Quora goes, if it is indeed successful, it might also very well be a victim of its own success, but maybe by then it will be financially viable, which is the one thing that matters most to its backers.",1295828801

As for tips, I've found that a good way to stay on top of knowledge broadly is to read edited handbooks and reviews. These sources might not be the newest but they certainly condense a lot of good empirical findings that have been tested over time and highlight the most important branches and directions. It's also kind of interesting to find who the grad students of the most prominent figures are and read their papers, proceedings.

My 7MBit DSL only has 1MBit upstream, which is hardly enough for me to route more than 4 other user's traffic through. That still doesn't solve the issue of privacy and anonymizing the users, since a user of the program, even if he is not actively downloading and uploading a file that he requested, is still liable for distributing a portion of the copyrighted files other users are requesting and distributing.

anything since the underlying fascination is always the real motivation.<p>Most all people sit around being annoyed by their software and hardware
because it is beyond their control, or more accurately, they let it be
beyond their control. You can see their frustration in the endless
drivel of rants on the Internet. The rants fix nothing. The only way to
ever solve the problem is taking control and making the machine do what
you want it to do.<p>Today I finally figured out how to prevent firefox from loading CSS by
default, along with adding key bindings to selectively load parts of CSS
(in page style, same-host style files, 3rd-party style files, ...) when
they are absolutely necessary. Some people thing CSS is a good idea and
should always be forced on by default, but others disagree. Those
opinions don't matter. What matters is I made the machine do what I want
to meet my own needs. It was a fun challenge.<p>Many people would say I wasted my time... --They don't get it.<p>Many people would take offense, yes, seriously. By removing all CSS I
basically just said all the UX/UI ""designer"" weenies are useless. I 
essentially deleted all of their ""hard work"" by making the machine do
what I want rather than letting it do what they want.<p>When one is unable to make a machine do what one wants, the problem is

It&#x27;s barely a blip on their radar. If one container ship were hit and a few of their containers were on board it would not hurt them financially, they have cargo insurance anyway. Storms at sea are a much bigger risk factor, containers fall off of cargo ships in rough seas surprisingly frequently, and voyages often get delayed by a few days due to weather. Water damage due to holes in the shipping containers is also very common. And delays at the port and rail hubs due to congestion. These factors are all much bigger risks to Wal-Mart (or any major importer) than piracy is.<p>It&#x27;s kinda like worrying about carjackings when an accidental collision is probably thousands of times more likely to kill you.",1407621467

8158120,comment,8157921,8157966,9,0,xaa,,,"I work in aging, and I think both avenues -- understanding the genetic bases of longevity, and working on repairing damage or other interventions -- need to be pursued in parallel.<p>Yes, genetics is hot, but also necessary to find the molecular drivers of the aging process. Despite what de Grey and others might have us believe, it is very far from clear what age-associated molecular changes qualify as &quot;damage&quot;. Which changes are causal and which are compensatory? Are the widespread changes in DNA methylation and other epigenomic markers that occur with age &quot;damage&quot;? AFAIK, no one knows.<p>Even when it is clear that a molecular change can probably be considered &quot;damage&quot; (loss of telomeres, DNA damage, protein aggregation), it is still unclear which kinds of damage actually need to be reversed to promote longevity.<p>I think it is silly to see SENS and Calico et al as if they were in competition. We are all working towards the same goal, and anyone who claims to know for certain which avenue will ultimately attain our common goal of achieving increased longevity is selling you a load.<p>EDIT: My personal opinion about the difficulty of funding the SENS program (which I&#x27;ll take your word for; I don&#x27;t know anything about their funding sources or situation), is the extravagant claims that have been made. Reviewers don&#x27;t like those. A lot of scientists have very ambitious and grand goals, but one of the secrets to grant-writing is to frame your goals as ambitious enough to be interesting, but limited enough to be attainable in the 3-5 year scope of a grant. And &quot;unlimited human lifespan&quot; is just a tad too ambitious.",1407621360

You&#x27;re pretty naïve if you think he&#x27;ll let those 100 employees work 20 hours/week now. No, he&#x27;ll fire 50 of them and let the wages of the remaining employees stagnate at best since there&#x27;s more competition for their jobs now.

8158105,comment,8154933,8155142,1,0,substack,,,"> If we really want to move into The Future, we need to start\n> versioning individual modules or functions, instead of\n> whole suites of software. But the cognitive burden of doing\n> this is very high, and the software to do it hasn&#x27;t been\n> written yet.<p>I don&#x27;t think this problem is related to any cognitive burden, but is an artifact of how the package manager works and how easy it is to liberally publish packages. Consider npm, where people publish packages with little to no coordination and everything is mostly fine (whatever the author of the parent article says). Because it&#x27;s so easy to make an npm account (anybody can `npm adduser` and start publishing immediately) and so easy to publish (just pick an unused name, make a package.json, and `npm publish`), people routinely make very granular packages, often just a single function. Importantly, these functions don&#x27;t need to fit into a taxonomy namespace like in haskell which prevents namespace hierarchy turf wars for the lesser price of namespace landgrabs.<p>Better still, you can have multiple different versions of a library in the same application. In your example, libB would just get the version of libA that its constraints satisfy but elsewhere other libraries could depend on a version of libA that do not satisfy the constraints on libA that libB requires because every package gets their own copy of their dependencies, with automatic deduping when the constraints are satisfied to save space.",1407621182

All I&#x27;d claim is that the qualities Chalmers cites aren&#x27;t evidence that consciousness is &quot;unexplainable&quot;.<p>Me: &quot;An intelligent being having internal representations seems very logical - computer programs often build a variety of representation of the things they modeling. &quot; - sure, the brain may be utterly different than a computer program but there isn&#x27;t anything in that difference that implies there couldn&#x27;t be an internal representation. If a computer program <i>can</i> do that, sure something far more intelligent could also.<p>The brain may indeed be well beyond we human&#x27;s ability to explain. But that fact hardly provides evidence for &quot;consciousness&quot; being an element of all reality, akin to space or time. Indeed, the vast physical complexity of the brain is evidence that other parts of reality aren&#x27;t that likely to share it&#x27;s properties, which is the exact opposite of what Chalmers argues - remember he&#x27;s arguing that because consciousness is &quot;unexplainable&quot; we have to attribute conscious to all matter to wind-up with the brain having consciousness (&quot;a photon has a small amount of consciousness&quot;).",1407621144

I get that it makes physics calculations easier and international machining companies need to interface with the world, but measuring the speed of my car in miles per hour and knowing my couch is 7 1/2 feet long are perfectly fine, and there is absolutely no compelling reason to switch to metric for those kinds of things.<p>People don&#x27;t want to switch because it&#x27;s a huge burden to retrain yourself to think in those units. I remember growing up that the US tried to do it—roadsigns in California had both miles and kilometers on them and our speedometers had both readings for a while. But it didn&#x27;t stick because there&#x27;s absolutely no point—it doesn&#x27;t improve anything, it&#x27;s just churn.<p>I&#x27;ve got a very intuitive notion of how long a mile is, and Europeans have a very intuitive grasp on how long a kilometer is.

It&#x27;s by Arthur Luehrmann, a Dartmouth professor who was asked to create a manual from Macintosh Basic. He wrote what I consider one of the best essays about &quot;computing literacy&quot;: &quot;Should the Computer Teach the Student, or Vice-Versa?&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.citejournal.org/vol2/iss3/seminal/seminalarticle1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citejournal.org/vol2/iss3/seminal/seminalarticle1...</a><p>Pasting Prof. Lehurmann&#x27;s comment on MacBasic here for posterity...it has some interesting musings about the importance of personal programming and has a Steve Jobs cameo to boot:<p>> <i>Andy gets this sad tale right. My partner Herb Peckham and I were free-lance writers brought in to create a manual for Macintosh Basic, which we did. More about that later. I first met Donn when we were both serving on the ANSI Basic Standards committee, whose goal was to set up specifications for a modern version of Basic that would contain loop structures, if-then blocks, and procedure calls, so the notorious GO TO statement could go away. Tom Kurtz, co-inventor of Dartmouth Basic, was also active on the ANSI committee. I&#x27;ve known Tom since 1965, when I was teaching physics at Dartmouth, and I knew Tom was keen on implementing a modern, structured version of Basic, and getting beyond the old (and much-criticized) line-number-dependent language that was becoming ubiquitous on micros, thanks to Bill Gates&#x27;s interpreter (which was mostly correct, except if you wrote FOR I = 1 TO 0, the loop would be executed once:no pre-test). I had added graphics primitives to Dartmouth Basic around 1976 and developed an X-Y pen-plotter to carry out graphics commands mixed in with the text being sent to Teletype terminals. My interest on the ANSI committee was to make sure the new Basic had a standard set of graphics statements. It became clear that Donn also wanted Macintosh Basic to be a modern, structured language that would leave Applesoft Basic as a memory. I pressed for Mac Basic to also include the graphics statements we were standardizing on the committee, and Donn ultimately agreed. That was around 1979. By that time I was at the Lawrence Hall of Science at UC Berkeley heading a program to teach kids about computers, both at LHS and remotely via Teletypes in Bay Area schools. We also had Commodore Pets, and we outfitted a van to take wheeled desks with mounted Apple IIs out to schools. Essentially, we taught programing in Basic on all systems. I left the Hall in 1980 and, with Martha Luehrmann and Herb Peckham, started Computer Literacy Press. Our purpose was to serve the needs of all the new computer users that were suddenly appearing, thanks to micros. Our first book project was &quot;Apple Pascal:A Hands-On Approach.&quot; Apple liked it and included a copy with each Pascal software package it sold. (If anyone is interested, I still have a dozen copies of the book.) That brings us to Macintosh Basic.</i><p><i>Apple invited us to create &quot;Macintosh Basic:A Hands-On Approach&quot; and have it ready in time for shipping with the software, which was six or eight months away. Herb and I took up offices at Apple and met with Donn several times a week to review progress. And what a pleasure it was to work with Donn! He was good at explaining details we had questions about, and he was completely open to ideas we had about the graphics elements. The same was true of Marianne Hsiung. So, as the months went by, it looked like Macintosh Basic would be the user-oriented language for the Mac:and it would be great. Our book was finished and in page proof, ready for the press. BUT . . . Steve Jobs invited me into his office one morning. Our office was a few doors away, and we talked from time to time. Steve seemed uncertain about something. Then he handed me a disk and said, &quot;What do you think about this?&quot; I took it to our Mac, loaded the software, and what I saw was Microsoft&#x27;s version of Basic for the Mac. Against Donn&#x27;s and Marianne&#x27;s creation, it looked antique: no structured programming elements, line numbers essential for GO TOs, primitive graphics commands, limited data types:a throwback, in a word. So, the next day I went back to see Steve. He asked, &quot;What do you think?&quot; I said, &quot;Steve, it&#x27;s a piece of shit.&quot; He didn&#x27;t say anything, but looked grim. A week or so later, we learned that Apple&#x27;s Macintosh Basic project had been canceled. Andy Herzfeld explains the situation accurately. The Apple II was the cash cow at that time, and without Applesoft Basic it would be worthless. Gates played hardball, and Apple caved. And so, sitting on a shelf in our basement are the page proofs of our book, &quot;Macintosh Basic:A Hands-On Approach.&quot; It&#x27;s the best of the 20 or 30 books we&#x27;ve done. But the saddest thing to me is that the Mac shipped with no user-level programming language. It was the beginning of the end of ordinary people writing their own programs. Computer buyers became customers of programs (now renamed &quot;applications&quot;) written by experts, not creators of their own, albeit modest, programs. It didn&#x27;t have to be that way.</i>",1407618442

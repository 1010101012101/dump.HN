For example, you could encode 1 TB of data into four shards, each shard containing 500 GB. You distribute these to servers in SF, NYC, Berlin, and Sydney. The key here is that you only need two shards to recover your 1 TB of data, and they can be <i>any</i> two shards. So if lightning strikes Berlin, and the Big One hits SF, your data is still safe. And thanks to erasure-coding, you can achieve this with only 2x redundancy (instead of 4x).",1440032319

Netflix doesn&#x27;t leave a margin for competition to undercut. No-one can compete with Netflix by offering a lower price.<p>And since Netflix has such a huge lead in number of subscribers, they have much more money to spend on quality of service (more content, better technology).<p>Low price works great for Netflix. I don&#x27;t see any new entrants competing with them (other than more content owners like ABC, CBS etc. trying to do what HBO did, but it&#x27;s really not the same thing as Netflix).",1440032303

With the public in a general froth over the whole episode, dropping in a celebrity, politician, preacher, etc would be child&#x27;s play.<p>This is similar to my view on the death penalty.  While most people debate over the morality (Is it right to murder a murderer?  Is it right to out a cheater?), I am more concerned about the &quot;facts&quot; (Was a person wrongfully convicted?  Is the data correct?).<p>In the case of the Ashley Madison data dump, there are at least a few points where it could be manipulated.  It could have been done to the original data dump, copies of said dump floating around (since the average person wouldn&#x27;t know which one is the original), and sites that have popped up allowing searching of email addresses (since really, the average person wouldn&#x27;t know how to download and search the data dump).<p>Even if all those weren&#x27;t manipulated, someone&#x27;s email address could appear because someone else used it.  I randomly searched for case@aol.com and obama@whitehouse.gov on one of the email search sites and both showed as hits.<p>I can easily see someone inserting fake data just for the lulz or for ideological reasons.",1440032208

So far so good. But the only way the status of an item is indicated when it isn&#x27;t active is the text colour of the label.<p>It took me a second or two to realize they were coloured to reflect the status and another few seconds to figure out which one was which and what was coloured or not.<p>Red/green colour deficiencies affect a significant percentage of the XY-male population (thanks to having only one X chromosome). Partial green deficiency alone affects a whopping 6%. In other words, if you pick 20 men at random, you should expect at least one of them to be affected. The problem becomes even more pronounced if your audience contains a disproportionate number of men (as automotive inspectors might be, if the gender gap holds true).<p>It&#x27;s an incredibly bad idea to rely on subtle colour clues alone to convey information. Especially with the thin font rendering in iOS and OSX the text colour is probably the worst choice (larger continuous areas of solid colours can be easier to distinguish but still present problems to individuals with more severe forms of colour deficiencies).<p>I&#x27;m green deficient myself, so I&#x27;m personally affected by this problem. Without the larger toggle as a reference I wouldn&#x27;t be able to determine which text colour is which (i.e. I&#x27;d have to rely on luminosity alone and likely assume the darker of the two colours is red).<p>If you want to design an interface like this, either back the colour clue up with another visual indicator like an icon (checkmark vs cross tends to be easily distinguishable even if the meaning isn&#x27;t necessarily intuitive in all cultures) or make sure the colour is applied to a large surface. Think of it like text size: the bigger the text, the easier the individual letters are to make out even to people suffering from vision deficiencies. Obvious caveat: it won&#x27;t help the (colour) blind, of course. You can&#x27;t improve on zero by multiplying it with a very large number.",1440031943

Frankly, I&#x27;m not entirely sure I would object to literally growing fetus brains so long as we understood what we were scared of.

You need a lot more than AWS + Akamai.  The costs of those are too high for the types of margins a Netflix-like service has.  Also, you need apps everywhere, and those apps have to be <i>good</i>.  Even though it&#x27;s getting a lot easier every day, it&#x27;s still way outside the reach of any individual show, they&#x27;re just not structurally set up to build and manage the tech side.  HBO can do it because they are just barely big enough, but individual shows will never jump that canyon.<p>What&#x27;s going to happen is not that shows replaces channels, but that <i>services</i> become the new channels.  Instead of having a few cable companies monopolizing the last mile, building and running all the distribution tech, and charging an arm and a leg for access, the new model is that there are no gatekeepers on distribution.  But that is not to say distribution is a commodity or easy, in fact doing good distribution ala Netflix that cuts across devices, geography, and a long tail of content will become an essential value-add and it will be more competitive than it&#x27;s ever been.",1440029406

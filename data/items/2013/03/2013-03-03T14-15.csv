5313878,comment,5312750,5313052,11,0,Pkeod,,,"Different Coloring Agents -
Paints and inks have different coloring agents. Paints are made up of tiny bits of colored minerals like clays or talc suspended in a colorless matrix such as polyester or vinyl. A chemical union of tannic acid and iron sulfate dissolved in water or alcohol forms the coloring agent of some inks. Others use such dyes as aniline.<p>Different Coloring Procedures - 
Ink soaks into the surface that it colors, but paints do not soak in -- they cover the surface with a coating. In fact, a primer is usually applied to the surface before painting so that the paint won't soak in. For this reason, paint sometimes chips off the surface that it covers, but this never happens in the case of ink.<p>Surface Protection - 
Paint not only colors a surface, but also provides the surface with a protective covering that will keep it from deteriorating when assailed by such agents as wind and rain. Ink offers no such protection.<p><a href=""http://www.ehow.com/facts_7225030_difference-between-ink-paint.html#ixzz2MUKSBJyN"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ehow.com/facts_7225030_difference-between-ink-pai...</a>",1362321988

Like money inflation, sometimes this is hard to accept :)<p>Of course Rails comes with a whole load of convenience code built in, which is loaded for each process and not always shared, people use gems, which are also loaded, people add apps on top, and people use in-memory caches etc. Those figures I quoted are for real world apps which pull in quite a lot of other code, though they are just taken from top/passenger-memory-stats, so take that with a pinch of salt. People use all that code because it's easier than reinventing the world each time, and developer time costs more than memory over the long term as sites are developed.<p>If you want to cut things right down, hello world in rails is around 40MB. Sinatra (another rack-based Ruby framework) does less and consumes about 20MB per process, so less again. A bare-bones script doing direct db access and some string manipulation (similar to those you were running back in the 90s) would probably take far less again and fit easily on your 32MB server, or of course perl is perfectly adequate too and might take less again (sorry no idea there) if you don't use a framework.<p>I suspect for most frameworks that you might use in perl though you'd see similar resource usage nowadays, simply because the resources are there and there is less cost for memory, and more cost for development time. Would be interesting to see figures for other frameworks/platforms which do similar work to Rails, as many are probably better on this front. Revel in Go for example takes around 5MB for a simple app, but it does far less at present - I suspect it'd remain far better for memory and performance though, even with extras like an ORM.",1362321485

It promotes teaching kids how to use a new tool that can assist them to devise solutions to whatever problems they desire. Most importantly it promotes teaching them a tool that they can use to express and communicate this.""<p>This seems like an even stronger endorsement for learning to code than anything even in the code.org video.<p>I think the real underlying sentiment in this post is to not learn to code for the wrong reasons, but kids don't care about future rewards like ""vats of riches, shiny things and scantily clad women.""

Priorities are not essential and can actually get in the way; I've always found it much simpler and less of a mind burden to categorize tasks by project (""project"" here meaning anything that takes more than one discrete task) and then simply tag the ""Next Action"" for any given project. You can then filter by ""Next Action"" and decide for yourself at any given moment what task will be best to do with the resources available to you (time, tools, location, energy).<p>Some examples of solutions that will do this:<p>- A directory of text files with #hashtags in their contents and grep<p>- Notational Velocity / Simplenote<p>- Any todo list app with real tags (not Wunderlist, for instance)<p>- Outlook<p>- Taskpaper or org-mode<p>I actually used Gmail for this for a while.

I was actually able to get it to work as advertised, and I believe that given 10 hours a day practice for a month, you could detect a sense of depth perception and make out attributes in your environment through your audio cortex enough to walk around slowly without bumping into things.  I had the blind friend test out the best I could do, and although it was a technological marvel, he actually didn't like it because it made people ostracise him even MORE than him being blind.  He can move around slowly without bumping into things much more fashionably with the system he already had, a stick, good hearing, touch, and memory.<p>So a few insights:<p>1.  If you are putting something in front of your eyes, or on your hat brim that looks like a hacked together bunch of cameras and wires and you wear it in public, there is millions of years of evolution causing people to ostracise you.  It's so bad, that a blind person told me: ""The ostracism from wearing it is worse than the ostracism from them realizing your blind.""<p>2.  You think you're confidant and can handle it?  You aren't, inside you are millions of years of evolution to remove what is causing the ostracism.  If you are the kind of person who can choose to remain single and lonely for life when you burn with passion for the opposite sex, then you have the kind of mettle it takes to wear cameras and wires on your head in public.<p>3.  The experience I had with converting visual to audio and using my audio cortex was tremendous.  For example objects that ""popped out"" at me during audio-vision were completely different than normal vision.  Take a brick wall for instance: I could hear the distance between the bricks (cement) was smaller in one spot, and larger in another spot because of an anomalous blip in the audio file.  When looking at it visually, you think ""meh"", it's just a brick wall.  With the audio file, the different brick leaps out at you as an anomaly.  Thus exposing the data structure/algorithmic differences between the visual cortex and audio cortex.<p>Doing visual as audio makes you an infant again, the tiniest changes in things leap out as fascinating.  This experience I had could probably be sold to people bored to tears with life.  A billion dollar idea!  Be an infant again.",1362319312

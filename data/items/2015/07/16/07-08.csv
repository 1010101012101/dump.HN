If\nyou <i>absolutely</i> need official confirmation, then you&#x27;ll need to email\nour fearless HN dev/admin Daniel (hn {at} ycombinator {dot} com) as\nrequested in the site Guidelines.<p>The rule is unwritten for a reason; it may change without notice, and it\nmost likely will change eventually. As HN grows and changes, both the HN\nforum software and people who run HN try to adjust accordingly.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to show the work involved with keeping HN clean, since\nany details posted would just be abused to game the system. By default,\nkilled comments and stories are hidden, so you&#x27;d need to turn on\n&quot;showdead&quot; in your HN profile to even see the junk. Since the junk is\nhidden, it&#x27;s are not indexed by search engines, and hence, it can&#x27;t be\nfound with common search engines. The associated Algolia HN Search\npowering the search box on the bottom of most HN pages also deletes the\njunk, eventually, even though it might initially index and show it for a\nshort time.<p>The &quot;News-To-Me&quot; and related &quot;Nobody-Noticed&quot; problems turn out to be\nhorrendously difficult when you ponder them in depth. Every discussion\nsystem is subject to attempts to game the system. Some attempt to gain\nmagic imaginary Internet points, or improve their reputation, or promote\nof their content and comments.  Others try to suppress and demote bad\nnews, or technologies they don&#x27;t like. There are rings, bots, and\nsimilar user clusters using voting, flagging and submitting in attempts\nto manipulate results.<p>Merging all of the related submission links into the active submission\non a general &quot;story&quot; topic (e.g. all of the recent Pluto related news\nstories) has been mentioned numerous times, but it is far more difficult\nthan it seems at first glance. A blogspam link to a Pluto story should\ndefinitely not be merged with links to stories from NASA, BBC, NYT, and\nother original and reputable sources. Your idea of &quot;merge and share the\nimaginary Internet point rewards&quot; would unfortunately fail. Abusive\npeople would game it immediately. Also, it would be a ton of mostly\nmanual work sifting the good from the crud, and dealing with the usual\ncomplaints.",1437032501

All of these players need to be fast but have vastly different risk profiles and trading style.<p>If you made trading more expensive or slower, traders doing useful things like making quotes or keeping the cash and futures markets in line would be driven out, making the markets less efficient. I&#x27;m less sure about the value that high-speed momentum strategies provide.

In retrospect, though, I am immensely grateful for my dad&#x27;s choice. There being almost no software for the C16, and in particular the complete lack of games, meant that the only thing I could really do with it was to start programming with the built-in BASIC. So, I learnt that... and it did not take long until my dad stopped being the person I could ask about how to do things on a computer...<p>First experiencing a computer as something you program instead of something you use to run programs written by other people was one of the coolest things that could have happened to me at that time.<p>Later, I got a Commodore 128.

7112662,comment,7109345,7112037,3,0,jarrett,,,"> Law enforcement doesn&#x27;t need to be based on secrecy. I never said you have to broadcast that you&#x27;re investigating someone, just that the information about who, how, and why you&#x27;re investigating someone be reasonably public (going through real courts to get warrants and such).<p>There&#x27;s a difference between judicial oversight and public oversight. The court may issue a wiretap authorization, yet that will probably remain secret for as long as it&#x27;s in effect. Otherwise, the wiretap will be largely useless. You can&#x27;t go to your local courthouse and demand a list of currently active wiretaps. It&#x27;s not public record.<p>> The basic idea would be to have redundancy in channel, location, mode, since we&#x27;re talking about a case in which the chain of command&#x27;s top has been ripped off leaving many higher-ranking officers at the top of the new chains. An attacker wouldn&#x27;t be able to take out all (all routes for all modes all over the US) of the communication network simultaneously, especially if we&#x27;re not talking about superbly massive bombings in which case there would/should be detection.<p>What you&#x27;re proposing is <i>maybe</i> practicable today. I doubt it would have been at the time in question. Technology was very primitive then, in comparison to what we have now.<p>> Also, to be credible, you&#x27;re assuming the US is telling other&#x27;s about their system (so that the USSR knows/will think that it can&#x27;t simply take out the president and there won&#x27;t be retaliation). Otherwise it&#x27;s all just based on speculation and in terms of deterrent doesn&#x27;t matter what the actual system is.<p>The assumption is that the enemy has some insight into your system. In which case it really <i>does</i> matter what your system is.<p>> Why must it be external, though. Both you and I are concerned about how the government should operate in a manner that protects the populace; I&#x27;m just saying that from the populace&#x27;s POV, the government is/can be an external threat. Look at Kiev right now.<p>Again, you&#x27;re arguing about a different issue than the one I am. I agree that a government can become an enemy of its public. But while that&#x27;s a plausible scenario, it&#x27;s not the one I was analyzing. Thus my comment that you&#x27;re shifting the meaning of the vocabulary to refer to a different concept.",1390524657

Wage theft is very specifically the act of withholding wages that an employee is entitled to according to the terms of his or her employment agreement.<p>What happened here is not even &#x27;price-fixing&#x27;, it&#x27;s a fairly weak attempt at &#x27;collusion&#x27;. Yes, it seems improper at first blush and the email exchanges are almost comically incriminating, but my guess is that it didn&#x27;t really have a substantial effect on the engineer salaries write large (or even executive salaries). Agreeing not to cold-call employees is not the same thing as refusing to hire them; that latter would have had a major depressing effect on wages (kind of like if all MLB teams had a handshake agreement to never sign another team&#x27;s free agent) but that clearly isn&#x27;t what happened here.<p>It seems to me like the proof is in the pudding.

7112645,comment,7111531,7112367,21,0,josho,,,"There are several reasons why software engineers are underpaid compared to their performance. Keep in mind these are generalizations and therefore you will find exceptions to what I outline below.<p>-Software developers typically aren&#x27;t comfortable negotiating, nor are we well versed at it. Therefore, we accept job offers for less than we know we are worth and accept raises offered rather than negotiate raises based on our actual performance.\n-We have no collective bargaining capability, and anyone can enter the field. In Canada engineers have a professional designation, the software industry is typically not a part of that collective. Lawyers have the bar exam to pass before they can practice. These restrictions restrict the labor supply in those industries to ensure higher wages. In our industry anyone can join, even foreigners, or employers can even outsource the labor to another cheaper country. This has the combined effective of raising the labor supply, and reducing our ability to negotiate as a group.\n-It is difficult to measure the performance from one developer to another. Look at sales as an industry, it is very easy to measure a top performer. If we were better able to demonstrate performance it would be easier for a developer to earn 50% more than his/her peers. Where I live some shops that hire refuse to pay even 10% more for a developer because they are filling head count and treat developers somewhat like a commodity.<p>The above realization has left me a little jaded. I love this field, but realize that I can earn more selling software than building software.",1390524468

I hate going back to my home country and I love the intellectual, rational environment here. But I&#x27;m stuck with my current company until I get a green card which isn&#x27;t bound to happen in the foreseeable future.  I read his book on this and I agree with one of Matloff&#x27;s points that H1-B should be solely for talent and I also agree with the reforms he suggests that there should be laws against exploiting them (ex: don&#x27;t imprison them with the whole green card ruse which could take 6-8 yrs for some countries).<p>However, I disagree with his generalization that H1-Bs are talentless compared to Americans (Just look at Goog). And that somehow they&#x27;re paid lower wages. All big companies (MSFT, FB, GOOG) pay H1-B candidates the same salaries as their American counterparts. And they all go through the same interview process. Personally, I went to a top 20 uni here and paid $100k in tuition alone.  It is true that bringing more <i>talented</i> H1-Bs will drive down wages, but isn&#x27;t that a competitive advantage ?(None of the European companies have this advantage really and I think it&#x27;s one of the main reasons for the valley&#x27;s growth.)<p>What we need to rectify is fraud of H1-Bs. Come up with a white list of companies that can use H1-Bs and make sure there&#x27;s no cheap, talent less labor. Don&#x27;t let body-shopping, consulting and outsourcing companies like Infosys, Wipro be issued H1-Bs. Most people in the operations group running our service for instance are on H1-B and frankly, the work they do can be done by any average American working at a BK/McDonalds. The pie that outsourcing companies are eating into is really a gold mine that should be used to expand the American middle class. But the outsourcing companies themselves seem to have powerful lobbying in place (NASSCOM). So it is a hard problem.",1390524176

There are times when an owner may not be motivated enough to list a property, but would be interested in a transaction if the right offer came through. There had to be a better way than sending letters to everyone though.\nFast-forward a year or so, and I put together a site to enable buyers/renters and owners/landlords in a slightly different way. Potential buyers or renters post their &quot;wanted ad&quot; on a map, and sellers/landlords/agents reach out if they have a property to offer.\nYou can check it out at http://www.howalis.com\nThoughts?

There are an entire range of viewpoints on this; you&#x27;ve just chosen two extremes to work from.<p>Some public people have been trying to clarify that the world won&#x27;t end, it will just be a far more miserable place to live. Fortunately, we have the smog problem in Beijing to point to as a very easy example of what to expect from population centers that don&#x27;t make efforts to control pollution.<p>Further, there aren&#x27;t just the effects of warming to consider, but lots of other environmental concerns too, like overfished oceans and oil spill disasters.<p>Earth won&#x27;t end. Earth will get along just fine without us.<p>> Is the world warming? I think it most certainly is, but I would also note that it appears that the warming trend has halted for the past 10 to 20 years.<p>It hasn&#x27;t. There was a &quot;missing heat&quot; problem, that has since been largely resolved by finding quite a bit of warming in the deep ocean. IIRC that study is still pending further research, but seems solid. If it&#x27;s true, then that&#x27;s a fairly bad sign, since ocean temperature is a lagging indicator -- i.e., it&#x27;ll continue to stay warm long after the atmosphere has begun to cool.<p><a href=""http://phys.org/news/2013-07-decade-unprecedented-deep-ocean.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phys.org/news/2013-07-decade-unprecedented-deep-ocean...</a>, &quot;Past decade saw unprecedented warming in the deep ocean&quot;<p>> Is the warming man-made? To a large degree, I believe that it is. However, there are a lot of things that we don&#x27;t understand about climate (solar cycles, effects of water vapor, ocean CO2 sequestration, etc.)<p>And, of course, the thermodynamics of the increasing numbers of UFOs and spectral spirits.<p>Seriously, though, the problem here is that, first, those factors have been looked at (although I&#x27;ll agree that they could benefit from further study -- but so could everything) and they have been found not to be influential, and second, there&#x27;s no evidence to think in the first place that they should be influential. That is, climate change denialists are running from rebuttal to rebuttal as each one is disproven, despite the overwhelming evidence that scientists <i>do</i> already know what the causes of warming are over the last few centuries.<p>For example: <a href=""http://www.ed.ac.uk/news/2013/sun-221213"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ed.ac.uk/news/2013/sun-221213</a>, &quot;Sun not a key driver of climate change&quot;; <a href=""http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/</a>, &quot;Climate change: How do we know?&quot;; <a href=""http://www.skepticalscience.com/argument.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skepticalscience.com/argument.php</a>, &quot;Global Warming & Climate Change Myths&quot; (answers 174 common climate change denialist myths).<p>> If I had to put a number on it, I would say 50 to 60% man-made.<p>This is a made-up number. It is meaningless.<p>> Can we do anything about it?<p>Absolutely. Lots of people have been doing things about it. For example, U.S. energy consumption has leveled off over the last decade, despite an explosion in personal electronics, thanks to increases in efficiency in everything from cars to energy production to the devices themselves.<p>And every little bit helps.<p>> This is where I begin to separate from the global warming crowd.<p>Er, with all due respect, you separated from the global warming crowd quite a while back in your comment.<p>> Theoretically, we can certainly do something about it, but having worked in government I just don&#x27;t see any practical way that we can reduce greenhouse emissions to such an extent that it&#x27;s going to make a great difference.<p>&quot;I can&#x27;t make a really big difference, so I won&#x27;t make a difference at all.&quot;<p>California added more residential solar in 2013 than in all previous years -- <i>combined</i>. Is that not a difference? Countries around the world have been building out renewable energy. Germany is now 25% renewable in energy production; Sweden has become so efficient at converting trash into energy that they&#x27;re now importing trash from other countries.<p>Certainly, not being able to make some impossibly large positive difference in emissions isn&#x27;t an excuse for continuing to make the problem worse, which is what denialists want.<p>> Further, china and India are ramping up their CO2 emissions, and there&#x27;s nothing that the developed countries can do about it.<p>&quot;My neighbor doesn&#x27;t maintain his yard, so I shouldn&#x27;t bother to maintain mine.&quot;<p>As the rest of the world continues to move forward in improved environmental technology, there will be increased incentives for China and India to do so too. There will be more political pressure, but the technology will also improve and become cheaper, as it has been for decades. At some point, it will simply make economic and political sense for India, China, and other countries to adopt better environmental technologies.<p>> Finally, I have ethical objections to telling developed countries that they have to use less energy which will inevitably result in more lives lost due to starvation or simply just malnutrition and poverty.<p>This is ... a very silly thing to say.<p>Nobody&#x27;s calling for energy or food reductions that will reduce populations. On the contrary, continuing to improve energy technology, as well as agriculture and education and medicine, will <i>increase</i> the life expectancy for a population, and, based on all available metrics so far, as people live longer, better educated, healthier lives, they naturally choose to have fewer babies.<p>What do you think the life expectancy is for the residents of all of the squatters&#x27; villages in the Pacific islands that have been destroyed by hurricanes and other storms?<p>Are you really advocating for continuing the use of old, wasteful technology which, as a side effect, increases the likelihood of devastating storm seasons, because it&#x27;s better for poor people?<p>> Should we do anything about it? I believe this is a cost-benefit analysis. And I haven&#x27;t done the analysis myself, but sometimes I question whether spending the enormous amounts of money today is worth putting off an uncertain disaster tomorrow when we have actual problems today that we could be working on instead.<p>Alright, look, you&#x27;re not questioning anything. You&#x27;re daydreaming. We live in an age of unprecedented access to information. When I was little, we had encyclopedias and public libraries; if I wanted to learn about a subject, I had to put in a lot more effort than is necessary today.<p>You could choose to spend just a few minutes here and there <i>actually</i> questioning all of this, and you could learn something and then you could have all of the benefits of a slightly more informed opinion, rather than just repeating the political talking points you&#x27;ve heard elsewhere.<p>And, by the way, climate is an actual problem that we do have today.<p>> We have millions of people every year dying from malnutrition<p>...and the technology to feed them, were it not for all of the navel-gazers wondering whether or not we <i>should</i>...<p>> ...poor water supplies...<p>...I&#x27;ve personally raised funds to send a hydrologist to Uganda...<p>> ...malaria...<p>...Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation...<p>> ...HIV/AIDS...<p>...tremendous amounts of ongoing research, to the extent that there now exist very low impact, long-term, cost-effective treatments for HIV/AIDS...<p>> ...etc.<p>So why do you believe that any of these things has to stop while we build more solar plants or work on further increasing vehicle efficiencies?<p>> Why not save those actual lives instead of spending the money saving hypothetical lives in 100 years.<p>Are you talking hypothetically, or practically? Is this a choice that you, personally, actually have to make, ever?<p>Why don&#x27;t you visit <a href=""https://watsi.org/fund-treatments"" rel=""nofollow"">https://watsi.org/fund-treatments</a> (a YC non-profit), and make a difference in an actual life there, and then come back and opine a little bit more about whether or not we should entirely abandon environmental R&D?<p>> And indeed, won&#x27;t we be more suited to save those lines in 100 years than we are right now, meaning that the mitigation effort could be a lot cheaper?<p>I fully expect that, 100 years from now, people will be having the exact same conversations, in some form or another, that they&#x27;ve been having for the last thousand years: &quot;really, what use is it to do anything at all, if we have to choose between doing one thing or doing another thing?&quot;",1390522422

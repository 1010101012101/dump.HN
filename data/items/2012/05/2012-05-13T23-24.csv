I got nothin' in terms of practical use cases. It's mainly a research thing. It annoys me that Lisp function calls look exactly the same as macro calls, but in fact behave differently, and making macros first-class fixes things up so that same look == same behavior. That way you can do crazy stuff like<p><pre><code>    (map (fn (a) (apply or a)) '((#t #t)(#t #f)(#f #t)(#f #f)))

Where normally this would produce an error ""or is not a procedure"".<p>My interpreter implements both lambdas and macros as syntactic sugar on top of vau expressions, so if I had a good way of compiling vau expressions, then the first-class runtime macros would be automatic. In the interests of efficiency, I'd like some way of doing static analysis to do as much macro expansion as possible at initialization / compile time, but that's dang tricky figuring out which macros will end up bound to which names before runtime.",1336952597

Detailed studies of life expectancy at advanced age in a variety of countries show that various lifestyle changes and other changes result in a worldwide trend of increasing lifespan, such that ""Very long lives are not the distant privilege of remote future generationsvery long lives are the probable destiny of most people alive now in developed countries.""<p>The top-ranked HN comment as I post my comment here says, ""In essence the FDA only approves medicines for specific, recognized, named diseases.

(I have lived in a developed country other than the United States, and am well aware that many treatments that are not approved in the United States are prescribed by physicians in other countries and researched by researchers in other countries.) The FDA is not shortening lifespans in the United States, despite what some advocacy organizations say to the contrary.<p>I have had multiple ancestors who were born in the 1800s live into their nineties. And my wife's ancestors, born in a poor country then in the undeveloped world, managed to have quite long lifespans. So we are accustomed in our family to thinking about the implications of long lifespans. Oddly, heritability of longevity is actually LOWER than the heritability of most measurable human characteristics.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/31/health/31age.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/31/health/31age.html?_r=1&#38...</a><p>It could be that anyone, even someone without much of a family history of long life span, might meet the prediction of the study linked above that a young person born after the year 2000 in a developed country is as likely as not to live to the age of 100.<p>Thus far we are making incremental progress, all over the world in a variety of human societies, increasing human lifespan and life expectancy at most ages. Meanwhile a number of forms of fundamental biological research are still just in their beginning stages. In particular, the issue of ""missing heritability"" in disease research<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2831613/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2831613/</a><p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3059431/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3059431/</a><p>suggests that we have a long way to go to identify biological pathways in living human beings that make a difference in how long individual human beings live.

It reports, ""There is now a ""groundswell"" of specialists in aging, says Dillin, who are lobbying the world's biggest drug regulator, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, to consider redefining aging as a disease in its own right."" If by ""aging"" those lobbying scientists mean ""all-cause morbidity and mortality,"" that could be a good reality check on outcome studies of treatments for specific diseases. As it is now, people are living longer, year after year after year, and in some places they seem to be living to a healthier old age than ever before.

3968694,comment,3968015,3968015,43,0,chimeracoder,,,"I'm a Columbia student - I'm not in GS, but a large number of my friends are, so I'd like mention two things:<p>First, Columbia's School of General Studies has an unusual (and oft-misunderstood) history.<p>Contrary to popular belief, it did not originate with the GI bill, though that is when the school took its most recent name. It was once (partly) an extension school; the continuing education program has since been separated, so GS students <i>are</i> attending a undergraduate college working towards a bachelor's degree. GS is the only undergraduate college at Columbia that allows students to study part-time, because GS students are considered to be those with 'nontraditional' backgrounds. Officially, this means anybody who's taken more than a year off since completing high school (or who received a GED), so eligibility for GS and Columbia College (the largest undergraduate college) are mutually exclusive. Other than that, though, the requirements are nearly identical - GS students have a slightly more flexible version of the Core, though even that is being brought more in line with the Columbia College requirements[1]. They take the same classes and choose majors in the same departments, so the only difference between the degrees is that the GS degrees are not printed in Latin (which was actually a debate a few years back!)[2]<p>In theory, GS students are students who would be merged into the regular arts & science colleges at any other university, but the fact that we have a college dedicated to reaching out to these students and providing them with administrative support means that we end up with students from a very wide range of backgrounds. In GS, the typical icebreaker is 'What's your story?', because almost everyone has a story of how they ended up at GS. If you've taken two (and often more) years off between high school and college, you didn't end up going back for your degree by accident.<p>This story may be good news material, but it's not even the most touching GS story I've heard.  We have veterans who were discharged under DADT, we have current and former performers and Olympic-level athletes - one of my classmates represented her country in Miss Universe 2008 and has been running her own business since then (she also graduated this afternoon). Another spent her teenage years in the foster care system and took classes at a community college to bring herself up to speed. I was the president of a student group that dealt with criminal justice reform and drug policy, and I can't count the number of students who've told me truly horrific stories of the criminal justice system and the war on drugs. Oftentimes these are stories of their family members, but a few have experienced it firsthand.<p>I wasn't even a GS student, but the single best part of my Columbia education was probably having the opportunity to meet people who come from such varied backgrounds and bring such a wide range of experiences to the table.<p>Second, some people seem to be curious about the free tuition: tuition benefits at Columbia are extensive, though controversial. Every employee, including the food servers and janitors, receive a living wage (not a market wage) and full health benefits. There's been talk of scaling the benefits back, though; this is not a matter of tuition specifically, but benefit cuts across the board.[3]. As it stands, I believe most employees are eligible for one free class per semester (three per year, including the summer). This is most commonly applied towards MA programs, as they're 1 or 2 years - doing the 124 credits required for a BA would take quite a while at this rate!<p>And unrelated, but possibly of interest: John Backus and Isaac Asimov were both GS alumni.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2012/05/02/general-studies-adds-global-core-requirement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2012/05/02/general-studies-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2010/03/09/gs-diplomas-remain-english"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2010/03/09/gs-diplomas-rema...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2011/04/19/report-recommends-scaling-back-fringe-benefits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2011/04/19/report-recommend...</a>",1336950499

If MessagePack does not have a mechanism for dropping down to int32 for integral doubles, then you will actually see a 9:1 difference for this specific case (although if you are often storing integers in your doubles maybe you should be using int32 anyway, in which case 3.1 may have been a better general example than 3.0 ;P).",1336950070

1492531,comment,1489281,1489830,0,0,frio,,,"Living in NZ, we get the regional prices too.  It boils down to publishers attempting to protect brick and mortar stores; if a game is no cheaper on Steam, then the thought goes that more people will go to the store and buy it as they see no advantage.<p>As far as I'm concerned, it's costing them sales.  If I want a physical copy of a game - like a Collector's Edition - I'll pay the extra.  If I don't, then pricing the digital download that's served <i>off the steam cache at the ISP I work for</i> in the same region just costs them a sale.  Case in point right now is Bad Company 2, but the same can be said of Borderlands (nabbed it in the 4-pack preorder for a reasonable price, then at launch it shot to $79.99USD :/) and many other titles.<p>Basically, it's a compromise I imagine Valve had to make to get large publishers signing with and selling their games on Steam.  I'd prefer them to now use some of their critical mass to lean on the next contract they sign and say ""we're a competitor to brick/mortar stores, we're losing sales because of your high pricing, and from now on we're going to compete"".",1278453336

Rights may be granted or withheld, by authority, without appeal. As a schoolteacher I intervene in many personal decisions, issuing a Pass for those I deem legitimate, or initiating a disciplinary confrontation for behavior that threatens my control. My judgments come thick and fast, because individuality is trying constantly to assert itself in my classroom. Individuality is a curse to all systems of classification, a contradiction of class theory.<p>Here are some common ways it shows up: children sneak away for a private moment in the toilet on the pretext of moving their bowels; they trick me out of a private instant in the hallway on the grounds that they need water. Sometimes free will appears right in front of me in children angry, depressed or exhilarated by things outside my ken. Rights in such things cannot exist for schoolteachers; only privileges, which can be withdrawn, exist.<p>The fourth lesson I teach is that only I determine what curriculum you will study. (Rather, I enforce decisions transmitted by the people who pay me). This power lets me separate good kids from bad kids instantly. Good kids do the tasks I appoint with a minimum of conflict and a decent show of enthusiasm. Of the millions of things of value to learn, I decide what few we have time for. The choices are mine. Curiosity has no important place in my work, only conformity.<p>Bad kids fight against this, of course, trying openly or covertly to make decisions for themselves about what they will learn. How can we allow that and survive as schoolteachers? Fortunately there are procedures to break the will of those who resist.<p>This is another way I teach the lesson of dependency. Good people wait for a teacher to tell them what to do. This is the most important lesson of all, that we must wait for other people, better trained than ourselves, to make the meanings of our lives. It is no exaggeration to say that our entire economy depends upon this lesson being learned. Think of what would fall apart if kids weren’t trained in the dependency lesson: The social-service businesses could hardly survive, including the fast-growing counseling industry; commercial entertainment of all sorts, along with television, would wither if people remembered how to make their own fun; the food services, restaurants and prepared-food warehouses would shrink if people returned to making their own meals rather than depending on strangers to cook for them. Much of modern law, medicine, and engineering would go too — the clothing business as well — unless a guaranteed supply of helpless people poured out of our schools each year. We’ve built a way of life that depends on people doing what they are told because they don’t know any other way. For God’s sake, let’s not rock that boat!""",1278453274

I can go create a new account with a fake Real Name quite easily, and that's only to troll on the forums.

By insulating them from adult-like work, adult social relationships, and adult consequences, we have only delayed their development. We have made it harder for them to grow up. Maybe even made it impossible to grow up on time. \nBasically, we long ago decided that teens ought to be in school, not in the labor force. Education was their future. But the structure of schools is endlessly repetitive. “From a Martian’s perspective, high schools look virtually the same as sixth grade,” said Allen. “There’s no recognition, in the structure of school, that these are very different people with different capabilities.” Strapped to desks for 13+ years, school becomes both incredibly montonous, artificial, and cookie-cutter. \nAs Allen writes, “We place kids in schools together with hundreds, sometimes thousands, of other kids typically from similar economic and cultural backgrounds. We group them all within a year or so of one another in age. We equip them with similar gadgets, expose them to the same TV shows, lessons, and sports. We ask them all to take almost the exact same courses and do the exact same work and be graded relative to one another. We give them only a handful of ways in which they can meaningfully demonstrate their competencies. And then we’re surprised they have some difficulty establishing a sense of their own individuality.”",1278452273

1492453,comment,1489867,1492068,0,0,doron,,,"Judith Butler had this to say on the subject...<p>A `Bad Writer' Bites Back<p>BERKELEY, Calif. -- In the last few years, a small, culturally conservative academic journal has gained public attention by showcasing difficult sentences written by intellectuals in the academy. The journal, Philosophy and Literature, has offered itself as the arbiter of good prose and accused some of us of bad writing by awarding us ""prizes."" (I'm still waiting for my check!)\nThe targets, however, have been restricted to scholars on the left whose work focuses on topics like sexuality, race, nationalism and the workings of capitalism -- a point the news media ignored. Still, the whole exercise hints at a serious question about the relation of language and politics: why are some of the most trenchant social criticisms often expressed through difficult and demanding language?<p>No doubt, scholars in the humanities should be able to clarify how their work informs and illuminates everyday life. Equally, however, such scholars are obliged to question common sense, interrogate its tacit presumptions and provoke new ways of looking at a familiar world.<p>Many quite nefarious ideologies pass for common sense. For decades of American history, it was ""common sense"" in some quarters for white people to own slaves and for women not to vote. Common sense, moreover, is not always ""common"" -- the idea that lesbians and gay men should be protected against discrimination and violence strikes some people as common-sensical, but for others it threatens the foundations of ordinary life.<p>If common sense sometimes preserves the social status quo, and that status quo sometimes treats unjust social hierarchies as natural, it makes good sense on such occasions to find ways of challenging common sense. Language that takes up this challenge can help point the way to a more socially just world. The contemporary tradition of critical theory in the academy, derived in part from the Frankfurt School of German anti-fascist philosophers and social critics, has shown how language plays an important role in shaping and altering our common or ""natural"" understanding of social and political realities.<p>The philosopher Theodor W. Adorno, who maintained that nothing radical could come of common sense, wrote sentences that made his readers pause and reflect on the power of language to shape the world. A sentence of his such as ""Man is the ideology of dehumanization"" is hardly transparent in its meaning. Adorno maintained that the way the word ""man"" was used by some of his contemporaries was dehumanizing.<p>Taken out of context, the sentence may seem vainly paradoxical. But it becomes clear when we recognize that in Adorno's time the word ""man"" was used by humanists to regard the individual in isolation from his or her social context. For Adorno, to be deprived of one's social context was precisely to suffer dehumanization. Thus, ""man"" is the ideology of dehumanization.<p>Herbert Marcuse once described the way philosophers who champion common sense scold those who propagate a more radical perspective: ""The intellectual is called on the carpet. . . . Don't you conceal something? You talk a language which is suspect. You don't talk like the rest of us, like the man in the street, but rather like a foreigner who does not belong here. We have to cut you down to size, expose your tricks, purge you.""<p>The accused then responds that ""if what he says could be said in terms of ordinary language he would probably have done so in the first place."" Understanding what the critical intellectual has to say, Marcuse goes on, ""presupposes the collapse and invalidation of precisely that universe of discourse and behavior into which you want to translate it.""<p>Of course, translations are sometimes crucial, especially when scholars teach. A student for whom a word such as ""hegemony"" appears strange might find that it denotes a dominance so entrenched that we take it for granted, and even appear to consent to it -- a power that's strengthened by its invisibility.<p>One may have doubts that ""hegemony"" is needed to describe how power haunts the common-sense world, or one may believe that students have nothing to learn from European social theory in the present academy. But then we are no longer debating the question of good and bad writing, or of whether ""hegemony"" is an unlovely word. Rather, we have an intellectual disagreement about what kind of world we want to live in, and what intellectual resources we must preserve as we make our way toward the politically new.",1278451909

There were other words widely used before the word hacker appeared: 'smart people', 'creative people', 'artists', 'scientists', 'mathematicians', 'engineers', 'polymaths' etc...<p>The word 'hacker' is a feel-good word for us programmers: we feel that we are more than just programmers, we are some kind of 'polymaths'. But the truth is that so are other smart people: noone should think that a very smart mathematicin, phyiscists, other engineers cannot be good in other disciplines. (And engineers especially were always a bit polymaths, because ergonomy, technical difficulties and business considerations always were there paralelly.) As it is with every successful essayists, pg's essays have some feel-good values. As I grow older I no more like the feel-good component of essays. I am not a hcker, I am an engineer, and I was that ever. This does not mean that I have to be totally idiot in every other disciplines, but being good at something requires lots of practice. People are called engineers because they practiced engineering a lot, people are called mathematicians because they practiced mathematics a lot, etc...\nIf somebody could be called a 'hacker' it is the caliber of somebody like von Neumann, but even him we call just a 'mathematician' (and we call Einstein 'just' a physicist).

Even if we were just using ffmpeg + simple scripts, we think there is value to using a service instead of our customers running video encoding on their own. We offer easy integration, automatic scalability, a well-designed API, and customer support. So theoretically Amazon S3 is just a file server, but it's still worth using S3. In other words, even simple technology has some benefits when packaged as a service as opposed to managing the technology yourself.<p>2. Beyond that, we're much more than just ffmpeg. ffmpeg is awesome, and we use ffmpeg as maybe 25%-30% of the work in our encoding chain. But video technology is really messy. There are hundreds of edge cases and non-standard files/formats/settings. The best tools take you 95% of the way there, but the remaining 5% is exceptionally painful, and a few tools plus (simple) scripts don't get you to 99%, let alone 100%. That takes thousands of hours of work, and it really makes sense to let a service handle that, instead of thousands of companies doing that work themselves.<p>Does that make sense?",1290011712

It is unlike most other programming languages in that it's declarative as opposed to procedural, and that can take some getting used to. Our primary motivations for choosing it at the time were that (1) it was a ""rules"" language with which we were already familiar and (2) its license permitted its use in commercial software (unlike Jess, which was another contender).<p>As ScottBurson has already noted elsewhere in this thread, it's not exactly a general purpose programming language. We for example used it as just one component of larger Java-based applications. Its performance, at least for the implementation that we chose, is not great, but there's a performance-flexibility tradeoff: if the alternative is to write-up a bunch of nested if-then statements in Java, and to have to recompile that every time the rules change, I believe that Prolog comes out ahead in terms of development time.",1290010604

The article seems to believe that Hacking =  coding, and thus Hacking Culture = coding culture, which I think is a pretty limited way to look at things.  Hacker culture is all about rejecting restrictive and unnecessary bureaucracy and procedures, and instead focussing on giving people the freedom and tools necessary to perform better and in a more creative way.

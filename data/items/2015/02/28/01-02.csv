9122473,comment,9120960,9120960,0,0,rlpb,,,"The reason git works so well is because it models real life. When you check out a tree to work on it, the moment you change a file in your editor you have forked the tree. Whether you save the changes or not, it&#x27;s a fork, even if a temporary one. More than that, it&#x27;s a <i>distributed</i> fork. What your undo buffer in your editor does, or your local filesystem does, or your VCS does, is merely an implementation detail.<p>It works well to be using a tool where the changes you make in your editor are unified with the more formal changes you&#x27;ll be pushing back upstream. It makes the whole process smoother, and means that all editing involves an identical workflow.<p>Even with Subversion, for example: if you make a local change in a file concurrent to something being changed in the repository, then what you have is a diverging branch. Subversion will try to auto-merge when your commit fails and you update your working tree (IIRC). Just because Subversion neither calls your working tree a branch nor your update a merge doesn&#x27;t stop them being so.<p>My point is that if you&#x27;re changing code that is also being worked on elsewhere, you are using a DVCS whether you like it or not. Even if you aren&#x27;t even using a specific DVCS tool. You have a DVCS the moment two people work on the same code base concurrently. So you might as well use a tool that integrates with the workflow that you already have.",1425088708

9122460,comment,9121482,9121482,0,0,eslaught,,,"I wonder, for people coming from non-systems programming languages (e.g. Python), whether it would help to visualize what is actually happening under the hood in a scripting language and comparing that to Rust. As others have noted, this guide is written as if to C/C++ programmers, while the intention (I had thought) was to also target scripting language folks?<p>My experience, having started in C++, then gone to scripting languages, then come back again, is that it can be quite helpful to consider what actually happens under the hood in a scripting language. Because Python&#x27;s references are more limited, you would never exhibit the same bug that you illustrated in C++, but there are still issues around e.g. aliasing which tend to trip up inexperienced Python programmers, and where you could illustrate interesting things about Rust&#x27;s ownership model. And boxed/unboxed data types plus reference counting (in Python) would give you an excuse to talk about RAII. So I think that you could do this in a way that would actually speak to savvy scripting programmers, while still being definitively systemsy.<p>Just a thought.",1425088294

A lot of epigenetics is common reactions to common circumstances, to the point at which the patterns are very similar between people. Sure everyone&#x27;s a special snowflake, just like every lawnmower rusts in a different way, but we also all age due to exactly the same underlying mechanisms, our metabolisms all operate on the same set of mechanisms, and so forth. Personalized medicine via epigenetics is the sort of thing you focus on when you can&#x27;t outright cure a medical condition by completely repairing the damage that causes it. It is a consequence of inability to intervene comprehensively, to the point at which the research community scrabbles for any handhold that says something about the condition&#x27;s progression, looking for comparison points that are mostly similar but just a little different to try to learn what is really going on.

Not only are there (seemingly) less people using CoffeeScript, but major related projectsâ€”such as CoffeeScriptReduxâ€”are closing up shop (see this comment: <a href=""https://github.com/michaelficarra/CoffeeScriptRedux/issues/336#issuecomment-70210965"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/michaelficarra/CoffeeScriptRedux/issues/3...</a>\n).<p>On the other hand, ES6 (and transpilers like Babel and Tracuer) are very popular right now. Some of that is hype & fad, but a lot of it is legitimate. In particular, I think that changes like the new module syntax are going to dramatically change Javascript development (even if we all transpile, speaking a unified module language is a huge improvement).<p>So, while I think it is totally reasonable to continue using CoffeeScript (and part of me really wants to!), it is hard to ignore/shun the community and momentum being ES6. For a while I was optimistically thinking that someone would eventually release CoffeeScript 2 (or even better, CoffeeScript6) that intentionally broke backwards compatibility to merge with ES6 semantics (classes, modules, etc). But now I&#x27;m thinking that is less and less likely (IMHO, CoffeeScriptRedux seemed like the best chance for that to happen).<p>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m ready to completely give up hope yet, but I think the article misses the point, communityâ€”and the (potential?) lack thereofâ€”is one of, if not the most important thing to consider regarding your choice of language.",1425087438

When I was growing up I was the kid who dressed as Star Trek characters for middle school Halloween parties when everyone else was seemingly obsessed with Star Wars. I never understood it. I attribute that to one character: Spock. With his unshakable discipline and faith (ha!) in logic as the method to explore our problems (&quot;Fascinating!&quot;), I identified with him more than any other character - because he didn&#x27;t fear the unknown. As the series and universe progressed, and Data in TNG seemed to fill that void I couldn&#x27;t help but notice the subtle commentary. Spock, half human, seemed to desperately try to repress his humanity - and therein show us why being human is all the more important - Data, literally a machine, a pure logic system, sought to become more human. \nThere&#x27;s a lesson in there somewhere. Maybe it&#x27;s just a commentary on the cultural zeitgeist of the times of the two series, but for me it&#x27;s simply to not fear the future or what&#x27;s out there, even if there are bumps along the way. Spock is a deep, and lasting character that I&#x27;m sure will remain influential. House of Cards can wait, tonight. Plotting a course for Regula 1.",1425085732

That was waved away with &quot;well, if I were working on power lines, I would just assume they were always live anyway&quot; by people who have never had an outdoors job, and whose entry-level salaries are where linemen top off at the end of a career.<p>Any home inverter that feeds power back to the utility is required by code to island itself when it detects a loss of utility power.<p>Also, I have a close friend who is a lineman, and has worked  in every state between Illinois and New York. He says (over the beer we&#x27;re having right now) that all lineman assume lines to be live, and they routinely perform service on hot lines without removing power.<p>Its not the newest fad we&#x27;re after; we&#x27;re excited by any prospect of the status quo shifting. History shows us technology getting cheaper and better at a constantly faster rate (I won&#x27;t say exponential, but close enough).

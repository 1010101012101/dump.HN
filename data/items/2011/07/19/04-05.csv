(And indeed, some would say this is happening now.)<p>If automation reaches its endpoint, where no human labor is necessary, how does capitalism continue to function? What value can members of the public offer in exchange for all the automatically-produced goods and services?<p>I think if that were to happen, we'd see some kind of major social reorganization.

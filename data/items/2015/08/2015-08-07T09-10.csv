10021659,comment,10015124,10015124,0,0,yariksheptykin,,,"Here in Bremen, Germany, I had been wandering the same thing! I have background in CS, some experience in teaching and experienced immigration myself. Some friends of mine and myself started giving basic german classes to a group of asylum seekers. We have been doing this for a 3 month now and experiencing some of what dorfuss writes about. Especially regarding the commitment to doing homework and attending classes. But also extreme desire of some to learn and learn much. All guys that I met managed to learn more german in 6 Months than I did in 2 years. Many don&#x27;t want to come back. They want to stay, study and work. I believe that having rudimentary CS skills is as important as literacy in Germany nowadays especially for students. So I see a great potential in such projects and would contribute to one.
Adding to the tips which the others mentioned here are some things we learned offering a german class. This list is not backed up by education theory or even best practices. This is just what we learned through trial and error in our own little project.<p>Consider this:<p>- Build/find a team. It is impossible to run such projects on your own. We have 10 people divided in 2 groups. Each group is offering a class every two weeks, i.e. this week Group 1, next week Group 2, week after Group 1, ...
  Having a group helps to offer consistency in the face of unforeseeable events like not feeling well,<p>- Offer classes on a regular basis like every week on Tuesday at 18:00. (otherwise people get confused.)
- Set a location. Always meet at the same location. (otherwise people get confused.)<p>- Remind people every week about the class. Go and pick them up at their place if needed. Many come from cultures where saying &#x27;see you next week&#x27; and &#x27;Terminkalender&#x27; mean nothing.<p>- Prepare yourself mentally to see no interest, don&#x27;t get frustrated. Sometimes we were standing there having only 1 student showed up. We then went to every room again to advertise our class and got 10 guys to join on that day. This does not happen often, but it happens.<p>- Don&quot;t offer incremental courses where every next class builds on top of the previous. This won&quot;t work. The people won&quot;t show up, and will not do their homework. Be ready to explain the &#x27;alphabet&#x27; (like explaining what type is) every time to some but also offer some intermediate material to others. We split every group into basic and intermediate subgroups while teaching German, this seems enough.<p>- Prepare material in form of loosely coupled practical exercises for 2 levels: beginners and intermediate. For ex learning HTML a bunch of beginner exercises would cover each single html element, a bunch of intermediate exercises would cover combinations of elements for producing meaningful layouts. But don&#x27;t plan too much, having 2-3 weeks planning ahead is enough. You will often have to reuse old material.<p>- Offer some fun after a class, but don&#x27;t offer breaks. We figured that 1.5 hours learning + 1 hour playing football, billiard, cards, or board games afterwards works the best for us. Having some entertainment afterwards helps to build personal connection - a very important thing.<p>Regarding the actual content I would suggest using Web technologies as the basis for teaching CS. It is well documented (see <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn</a>, <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp</a>). There are lots of interactive examples. Everybody has experience using web. It&#x27;s everywhere, you don&#x27;t need special software/hardware, one can even use their smartphone to play with HTML/CSS/Javascript.",1438941550

10021624,comment,10014178,10014178,0,0,koffiezet,,,"I never liked the Ruby syntax, so the beauty of Ruby is a bit subjective and the title is clearly pure clickbait, &#x27;dissing&#x27; go, which is a lot more popular and well known - but when clicking on the link there is not a single mention of it.<p>That said, it looks like a really cool project, with many nice language features Go is clearly missing. Attacking Go on performance is a bit silly though, this is purely by the choice of being a frontend for LLVM, not by language design. The choice for LLVM is understandable, and at first I thought Go made a mistake here, LLVM is really nice - but it also clearly has it&#x27;s downsides. On one hand I wish Go had access to the optimization power of LLVM, on the other hand I&#x27;m glad it has no dependency on it and is standalone. Thanks to this, cross compiling is a breeze, and adding support for new platforms is entirely controlled by the Go team and it&#x27;s contributors, although I don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;re going to handle iOS support now that Apple switched to LLVM bytecode for application distribution which they then compile to native code on their servers before delivering to the device. Maybe Go can add an LLVM bytecode target, which would mean it could also benefit from it&#x27;s optimisations.<p>But in most cases, once you&#x27;ve passed a certain treshold, performance is not <i>that</i> important anymore, and once you&#x27;re running reasonably fast native code, that should not be a problem anymore. I&#x27;m already happy with the current trend of going back to native code instead of thinking that CPU&#x27;s are fast enough to interpret everything and that memory is cheap.<p>I also quickly tested compiling a &#x27;hello world&#x27; example with both Go and Crystal, and the binary sizes were quite similar:<p>- Go (1.4.2): 620K<p>- Crystal: 619K<p>- Crystal release: 528K<p>So Crystal is a little bit more compact at first glance, but at first glance not that spectacular. Go is notorious for generating quite big binaries. The thing is however, that Go always produces static binaries - it does everything with it&#x27;s own stdlib, unless it involves DNS resolving. A quick LDD on the crystal binaries revealed it wasn&#x27;t a static binary and depended on libc. So I tried compiling the same hello world staticly in crystal, which gave me some warnings and a whole different picture: a whopping 1.8M binary. So more compact? Not necessarily.<p>Library-wise however, Go is lightyears ahead of Crystal. Go&#x27;s stdlib is amazing, and there are an surprising amount of 3rd party libraries written in native go.
Crystal on the other hand has the advantage of being able to use existing C libraries with ease and little overhead, but this could also be a downside and impact clean library design and consistency in the long run. It not being 100% Ruby compatible and not able to blindly use any Ruby library is a handicap here.<p>All in all, I think both Go and Crystal could learn from each-other. Go is a bit more mature and has clearly been accepted in the server/sysops space, many new projects there being written in it (docker, consul, etcd, heka, kubernetes, prometheus, influxdb, the grafana backend, ...). For crystal to earn it&#x27;s place somewhere, it will need a lot of work.",1438940659

After he read “Deep Neural Networks Are Easily Fooled,” Dileep George, cofounder of the AI research firm Vicarious, was curious to see how a different neural net would respond. On his iPhone, he happened to have a now-discontinued app called Spotter, a neural net that identifies objects. He pointed it at the wavy lines that Clune’s network had called a starfish. “The phone says it’s a starfish,” George says.<p>Spotter was examining a photo that differed from the original in many ways: George’s picture was taken under different lighting conditions and at a different angle, and included some pixels in the surrounding paper that weren’t part of the example itself. Yet the neural net produced the same extraterrestrial-sounding interpretation. “That was pretty interesting,” George says. “It means this finding is pretty robust.”<p>In fact, the researchers involved in the “starfish” and “ostrich” papers made sure their fooling images succeeded with more than one system. “An example generated for one model is often misclassified by other models, even when they have different architectures,” or were using different data sets, wrote Christian Szegedy, of Google, and his colleagues.4 “It means that these neural networks all kind of agree what a school bus looks like,” Clune says. “And what they think a school bus looks like includes many things that no person would say is a school bus.

10021552,comment,10021099,10021367,0,0,repsilat,,,"I think so.<p>I figure C++ has a static type system in most places because it helps the language be fast -- resolving the target of a method call at compile time turns it into a straight function call, and straight function calls can be inlined etc etc. You know how big your objects might be, so you can put them on the stack and you can copy them back and forth.<p>Templates give you a limited kind of polymorphism without sacrificing all of this nice stuff. Compilation of templates is &quot;interpreted&quot;, though -- you don&#x27;t compile a program to quickly instantiate them, you don&#x27;t JIT them, the data structure just keeps data structures in memory along with its ASTs and it iterates over them, doing its type-checking and everything else &quot;the slow way&quot;. I guess C++ compilation looks a lot like Python interpretation, with &quot;No candidate for operator<(const T)&&quot; standing in for AttributeError, and pages of horrible template messages standing in for tracebacks.<p>This analogy raises a question, though -- if Python doesn&#x27;t need type checking to get nice error messages, why do C++ templates? An alternative to &quot;assert hasattr(a, &#x27;__cmp__&#x27;)&quot; is try-catch.<p>Why not do the same with std::sort? Put a big compile-time try-catch around it, catch your template errors and present a nice message to your users.<p>What benefits would this have over type checking? If anyone wrote their concept specifications too strictly, they might stop your valid program from compiling, and this wouldn&#x27;t happen with static try-catch. Maybe they thought you needed a random access iterator when all you needed was a forward iterator.<p>What benefits might concepts provide? Same as regular type checking -- if you <i>know</i> that the provided type has to present a given interface, you probably do something crazy like give your compile-time types vtables for the interface, and dramatically speed up compilation times. I don&#x27;t know that anyone will actually do anything like this, though.",1438939262

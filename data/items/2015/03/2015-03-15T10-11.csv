The company is very hierarchical, but hierarchical on the basis of the way individuals command (and collect) influence and power. One employee described it as &#x27;who&#x27;s got the biggest dick&#x27;.<p>Which means that people who are naturally political end up with all the power, even if they don&#x27;t make good decisions, and they aren&#x27;t held accountable for their management activities, because the fantasy is that they&#x27;re not managing anyone. And introverts or people with alternative ideas (especially ideas that threaten the alphas) tend to be dumped on, badly peer reviewed and fired.<p>Although this company receives praise inside and out for its flat structure (even the CEO is just one of the team, don&#x27;t you know!) All it has done is replace professional management* with management by popularity, from what I can see.<p>[Edit: It has already been mentioned in other comments as an amazing example of wonderful flatness! :D It&#x27;s PR is good, I&#x27;ll say that!]<p>There is more than a little of the high school atmosphere, to be honest.

There must be some.<p>I don&#x27;t actually find this set terribly objectionable, at least when they&#x27;re treated as guidelines rather than rules, but I&#x27;ll have a go anyway.<p>Excessive focus on issues like this is seen as a symptom of a managerialist culture.  While few developers I know would object to the ideas that everyone has something to learn, and that apprentice and journeyman coders should be supported and encouraged, there is -- sometimes justified -- suspicion that the real agenda is to commoditise developers and turn programming from a craft into a factory-floor activity.  Or, to refer to another article that&#x27;s on the front page this morning, to turn antiwork into work.<p>The kind of things that get put in place to &quot;compensate&quot; for ego are rules which value maintenance over re-writes, and third party components (even if they&#x27;re only a tenuous fit for the problem) over in-house development.  While I agree that there are biases to be aware of here, dismissing every proposal for a re-write or new internal development as egotism ends up shutting down discussions about the actual trade-offs.",1426414409

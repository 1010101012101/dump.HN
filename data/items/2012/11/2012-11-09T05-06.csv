Australians begrudge voting (and that we must fully enumerate our preferences).<p>The pragmatic reason for having compulsory voting is to provide a better sample of what the population wants. In effect, to dilute the crazies.<p>Voluntary voting is dominated by the question of <i>motivation</i> and <i>ability</i>. Those who are motivated and easily able to vote set the agenda.<p>Ever wondered why US politics is dominated by so many basically tangential issues?<p>Because whether you are pro or contra, abortion / marijuana / the death penalty / public health etc are classic issues to Get Out The vote.<p>And the consequences continue.<p>Ever wondered why US politics is about soaring rhetoric and heart-crushing negativity?<p>Because the basic strategy is: inspire your own voters so they turn out (""Yes we can!"", ""America is at a crossroads"") and make the other guy's voters disillusioned enough so that, while they won't vote for you, they'll just stay at home.<p>Australian politics is more about transactional than transcendental issues, simply because the great bulk of people are required to vote whether they want to or not.<p>To summarise: it does not greatly improve the quality of <i>voters</i>. It improves the quality of <i>outcomes</i>.",1352440763

Also, just reducing your balance of debt is good for credit. Plus, I don't think there's anything worse you can do for your score or future hopes of loans than declaring bankruptcy.",1352440692

Or, you could think of it as giving an alternative to those who want to work on big explody things, but aren't comfortable with them being used to kill people.<p>* Economic stimulus - those billions of dollars aren't just disappearing. A large amount of the space industry is US based, and that money goes to them and their employees and creates/maintains both skilled and unskilled jobs.<p>* Scientific research - There are plenty of things we don't know that would benefit from modern sensing or analysis capabilities that weren't available in '72.<p>* Human progress - At the rate humanity is expanding, eventually we're probably need to gather resources off-planet, whether it's orbiting solar power satellites or asteroid mining, that tech needs to be developed.

(i)They DO sue over design patents. 
(ii). This particular patent specifically says unbroken (dashed) lines are not included in the patent. So the only thing that is the basis of this patent is the rounded rectangular front shape (which is represented by the unbroken lines, in fact, that's the whole point of the article, which fanboys don't seem to understand).

The only downside of client certificates is that they can be a PITA for developers, especially if you find yourself frequently spinning up new dev and staging environments. Also, on a PaaS this might force you to check-in your certificate alongside your code in order to deploy it. On dotCloud you can avoid this with the rsync upload method (which is now the default in 0.9).",1352438083

Nobody from business has access to the admin panel and nobody from editorial has access to the business contacts.<p>I really couldn't imagine an advertiser asking reddit to remove a post for them.

This results in a non-cash accounting change for the ower and a boon for the lender. Economic activity is boosted if the lender's investment/consumption is more sensible than the donor's - ower does not figure into the algebra. This is likely to be stimulative if the lender's marginal propensity to save excluding risk investing is low.<p>If these are performing loans, on the other hand, the donor is, via OWS, acting as a market maker for the lender, providing them with liquidity/immediacy while granting the ower cash flow. This is like a stimulus payment to the ower (provided they consume the extra cash flow or invest it in risk assets). It's also a bail-out to the lender.<p>This is structurally identical to the Federal Reserve buying banks' assets, e.g. loans, and Washington increasing high-velocity fiscal spending. OWS's plan has the downside of being market distorting (via moral hazard) while the prior is less so (Fed's buying activity can be distorting if not done properly or if amped up to supplement Congressional inaction).<p>I came here expecting to chastise this but, economically speaking, it's a better use of surplus savings than having them sit idly in the money markets. It is, though, worse than building things, funding research, or helping feed starving children. Kudos, still, for beating par (the money markets).",1352437316

Demos are provided that parse makefiles or generate rules by searching the source directory with no user script [2].<p>Relative to the OP&#x27;s concerns, a configure step is required and can search the system, call pkg-config, write config.h, etc. Arbitrary command line options can be added by shared tools and user scripts.

Thanks for the feedback, positive and negative.<p>The idea behind Transpose is the lack of options between something as simple and ubiquitous as note taking apps like Evernote and fully fledged database solutions like FileMaker and Access.<p>What we found out from our research is the a lot of use cases and critical applications should have been built on a database if it was feasible, affordable, cloud based and anyone can build without the need of hiring a software house or even dedicating an enterprise IT department to build something from scratch. People have been tracking orders, leads, assets and even critical project planning on various apps including even Evernote which is not designed for those use cases.<p>With Transpose we are also tackling the growing epidemic of having a dozen of different apps all stitched together somehow duplicating the data across and demanding the team to learn and use each one of them just to visualize information differently; like Trello on boards, spreadsheets in table form, notes just for ease and cross platform functionality. We shooting high aiming to disrupt and fix that as well. If the data is structured and we extract all this extra metadata on top of that automatically so why not utilize your data and get as much value out of it?<p>Here is a quick intro video on Transpose <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfKeTljl5ro"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfKeTljl5ro</a><p>We have all sort of amazing technology working seamlessly behind the scene. Text Analytics, Entity Extraction, Voice Transcription, OCR on images,  Filtering by fields, sorting syncing online and offline with a native iOS app and a new Android app coming out next week. You can see your data in multiple views, plot it on Calendar, see it as an editable spreadsheet, or even on an interactive Kanban board. There are more than 20 patents in many areas technological and UI its all BY DESIGN blends in to be invisible.<p>I do agree though, its really hard to put what we are doing and describe it in one sentence. I love Peter Theil&#x27;s talk at the Launch where he articulated EXACTLY the situation we are in now.. what category shout that FIT in? what is that like? who direct competition do we have?

Awesome Makers create templates to solve every single problem you can think of and then they share that template with their followers to clone a copy and they also invite collaborators (typically co-workers) to work on a shared template data set feeding new data and manipulating it.<p>Would love your feedback and thanks again everyone!

Anyone today has higher odds of having to drive to work, having a roomba and easy surfaces at home, carrying a tablet or just a phone, having no steps in their living area and an elevator at work, not cooking at all by 1980&#x27;s standards, having a private washing machine, being afraid to walk after dusk...<p>Then for the 40 hours they actually spend at work, there are various equipment and practices to no longer lift patients frequently in the ER, etc. Many nurses are spending a lot of time reading things, comparing numbers, following (manual?) push carts and entering pill data. A few ER nurses may be doing more exercise now, but the average could look shockingly low to a travel agent from 1980.<p>I would expect the articles premise if I ran the study. That makes me more suspicious of the outcome; we find what we expect to find when a study can&#x27;t be perfectly controlled. Swapping the 1980s and 2010s environments is a perfect example of poor control.",1443724350

We&#x27;d love for you take a few minutes away from sewing that &quot;ghost in the machine&quot;, and to consider a career with NCC Group!<p>NCC Group is constantly hiring security consultants from ALL backgrounds to join our team. If you’re a tinkerer, a breaker rather than a builder, or someone who wonders “why” and ends up down the rabbit hole 36 hours later with a disassembled air conditioning unit surrounding them... we’d love to hear from you! Our process welcomes those with years of experience, as well as those with little to no direct experience in what we do.<p>The bottom line: if you love security and research, NCC Group just may be a perfect fit for you.<p>What do we do exactly? Penetration testing, security analysis, and cutting-edge research into current technologies and attacks (breaking things). You spend most of your day thinking about security systems and how they can break. You get to be creative and have a lot of freedom to be clever while learning new technologies at a very fast pace. Engagements are usually 2-4 weeks long and in a year you will be exposed to 15-20 products and technology stacks. Your work will typically initiate person-months of security improvements in products millions of people use. You will have access to senior engineers/architects and your findings/ideas will be heard by senior decision makers. You will have enormous impact in making the software people use safer. All of our consultants are also security researchers, with dedicated research time.

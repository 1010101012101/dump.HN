Chicago has one of two 24-hour rapid-transit systems in North America (NYC is the other one), a beautiful lakefront, great deal of ethnic diversity, and is possibly the best American city for skyscrapers (NYC is the only other contender). Atlanta is walkable/bikeable if you live in the city, has the 3rd-largest gay population in the U.S. (after SF and NYC), and is one of the leading centers of Black American culture.<p>Overall imo there are lots of interesting urban places to live, the main issue is just making sure to live in the actual city rather than the suburbs, if you want a city lifestyle.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/documents/dangerous-by-design-2014/dangerous-by-design-2014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/documents/dangerous-by-des...</a>",1438318436

Both.

Social attitudes (the &#x27;ideals&#x27;) change because productivity gains due to technology means that household chores no longer take 40 hours+ per week.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure the data from the 2010&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t take Instacart and other on-demand-everything into account because it has yet to be everywhere, but just think how awesome everything will be in this coming decade!",1438318348

It always feels like I&#x27;m trying to emulate floating-point arithmetic on a CPU without hard float support. It kinda works if you can do a lot of integer operations quickly. But unless the emulator is really good, you&#x27;ll get all sorts of rounding errors.<p>In some ways, I&#x27;ve even gotten a little too good at emulating some types of interactions. I&#x27;m still lousy at realtime verbal communication, but when it comes to written communication, I can catch all sorts of nuances and unstated assumptions that ordinary people often miss. It&#x27;s one of those cases when an emulator or hypervisor outperforms bare metal under some workloads. Since my emulator is so lousy at verbal communication, I&#x27;ve optimized the shit out of it for written communication.<p>At the end of the day, though, all this heavy emulation takes a toll. My brain burns a lot more cycles (calories?) running the emulator all day long and rapidly context-switching in and out of it. It makes me exhausted after a few hours. I wish our society was organized in such a way that I wouldn&#x27;t need to spin up my emulator so often.",1438318194

Humans also behave sub-optimally because they are trapped in systems full of crazy perverse incentives. The world itself is full of paradoxes and chaotic feedback loops; the best intentions rationally and logically executed can and do lead to perverse outcomes that would not and maybe even could not be forseen.<p>Sometimes a rational investigation terminates with a big WTF. People see UFOS or Bigfoot all the time, and they&#x27;re not all nuts. What are they seeing? Not enough information. The universe doesn&#x27;t present you with all the evidence so you can tie a neat bow around it. It presents you with a dirty noisy incomplete data set so you can ponder it forever. (See also: bounded rationality. Bayesianism deals with this problem by defining truth as a float instead of a boolean, which I kind of like. Bigfoot might 0.0137384 exist.)<p>The universe gives us Fermi paradoxes and dark energy and Godel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem.<p>That being said, I do like the aversion to the idiot plot. It&#x27;s a big pet peeve of mine. I also like stories where all the characters have depth. To me that&#x27;s just good characterization, something often lacking in genre fiction. Even if the villain (or the hero) is mad or irrational, there is some depth to it and they have their reasons however twisted these might be. But a lot of that is just good writing.<p>I also like the aversion to the deus ex machina, which is also lazy writing.

I dedicated a section to this fact: <a href=""https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/adv-book/leaking.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/adv-book/leaking.html</a><p>However I <i>will</i> say that Rust makes it a lot harder to accidentally leak resources (it&#x27;s trivial adversarially -- but I don&#x27;t consider that an interesting programming environment YMMV).<p>In e.g. Java you need to remember to `close` a File -- in Rust it will close itself as soon as you stop using it unless you do some wild things. We can&#x27;t formally guarantee anything better than the Java scenario; it&#x27;s equivalent to whoever you pass a file to having to call `close` on it.<p>However the <i>defaults</i> are reversed: In Java you don&#x27;t close a File by default, and have to explicitly do something to close it. In Rust you close a File by default, and have to explicitly do something to <i>not</i> close it (mem::forget or Rc cycle).<p>This is a pretty general theme for the wins Rust provides: it picks the best default so simple things are simple, but gives you all the tools to bypass that default. By default you want to close files. By default you want to free memory. However you <i>can</i> leak these resources when it makes sense.<p>The most interesting case for me is our HashMap: we default to SipHash seeded with some OS entropy to prevent algorithmic complexity attacks. This is an explicit choice to protect our users against a relatively obscure problem. Honestly, it&#x27;s probably <i>not</i> what most users of HashMap need. Determinism and speed is probably nicer. And yet the cost of <i>not</i> having that safety guard when you need it is pretty extreme.<p>However if you know what you&#x27;re doing you can just grab a community crate with a different hasher and plug it into our HashMap.

It&#x27;s basically just arithmetic, comparisons, i/o, and gotos, right? But building systems using assembly results in extremely complex code because it lacks the tools to manage complexity well. You end up with a rats nest of spaghetti code often, for example, unless you use structured programming macros. C++ seems &quot;simple&quot; but it ends up being essentially a &quot;write-your-own-language&quot; language with the way you can use templates, macros, and operator overrides. There&#x27;s no such thing as one C++ language, there are actually hundreds of dialects that are used by different groups of people for different purposes, almost all of them effectively mutually inoperable with one another. This is a complexity nightmare.<p>Rust is a systems language, like C/C++, but designed from the ground up and based on modern techniques. For example, there are ways to use C++ which are particularly advantageous from a memory management aspect, such as RAII, but enforcing such uses comes down to culture/policy. Rust instead is based on different principles, specifically the idea of &quot;borrowing&quot;, to handle memory management instead of relying on either extreme of &quot;do what you want&quot; or &quot;the GC will clean up after you&quot;. There are a ton of other concepts which are baked into the Rust design which result in the ability to create programs that are easier to maintain, more likely to be correct, and more likely to be safe/secure, without sacrificing performance relative to C++ running on bare metal.",1438316588

Part of the problem (in addition to people who like to oppress and/or apply their racism) is that police are expected to force people to comply.

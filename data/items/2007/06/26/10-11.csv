It is not cheap to do a ramp show in Paris or New York, it is not always succusful.I am not suggesting sponsoring visas - I never did.<p>2. I suggested that there is much demonstrated capability, I also suggested you do some research starting from the 1980s. I also highlighted why I think there has been lack of resident Indian success in this arena while non-resident Indians have had a better game.<p>3.I do not think it is difficult to identify good ideas from all over the world - YC already does it in an unorganized format. My contention is that in a virtual platform such as our trade offers us, thinking local is unnecessary and perhaps outdated baggage we carry. There is no need to deploy talent scouts or some such to find the necessary hackers, they will find YCombinator or other such oppurtunities - it just needs to be a more encouraging process than it already is.<p>4. I have no clue what gave you the notion of a YC United Nations save the world thingy?!<p>5. I am certain YC has lots to do, and I put up my thoughts for discussion on this thread that someone else started, pg has since then responded but the discussion on the Indian startup scenario can carry on nonetheless. Your comment about 'whining' is inappropriate. I will not regard it as a personal comment, just a poor choice of words - correct me if I am wrong. :)<p>6.I agree with your advice about hacking away and building something that people want. I hack too, have been doing it for a long while, intend to do it forever, thanks for the advice nonetheless.<p>7.I have some advice too, I suggest you study hosting costs along with hardware costs - there is no way any salary in Banglore(for a techie) is going to take care of your hosting costs and just how long are you planning to host for before you need help. If your startup is anygood, it will need some serious servers, If you need references for good hosting providers and thier price charts, send me an email and i will send you some. keios.titan (at) gmail. Obviously, hardware or hosting requried depends on your application. My startup project has fairly high hosting demands.<p>8.You said: ""Do I think I am somehow entitled to them just because ""I want""? certainly not!""<p>I said: What!?!<p>I would like Paul's advice and YComb's resources too, I do not think they will come to me - I will go to them.<p>9. Well if you suggest the humour is because i cant recall the name, then I don't see the humour. The IIT Chennai startup targets a rural population, I am not a target customer.<p>10. I am not in the least persuading YC to come to India, and certainly I am not betting on that. I am saying ""that they should help hackers who don't know any better through all the other rigmarole involved if they shortlist them.""<p>Its there decision and this is a discussion board you know.<p>Best of luck with your project, do let me know if you come to Delhi sometime :)",1182854308

For example videocasting. Then, there are big markets, that were not so hot, e.g. browsers around 2002-5. Before Firefox anyway.<p>If its hot, you probably have already missed it.",1182852150

Basically, for a lot of BBS software (and usually enabled by default) visitors to your BBS when posting in discussion threads could insert escape characters (like ""%UN"") which at runtime would be replaced with metadata related to the person viewing the post at that time.<p>So, if I were to post ""%UN's mother was a hamster and father smelled of elderberries"" as part of a thread when I viewed it it would say ""gfodor's mother..."" etc. You could have first name, last name, etc, so with some creative thinking you could post fairly convincing posts that would trick people into thinking you were actually legitimately mentioning them.<p>I can remember many posts filled with angry replies from random users who went off the deep end when seeing that some random person on the BBS was trash talking them personally. Oops.<p>Edit: And for the curious, the purpose of these codes was usually for people creating assets for the BBS. For example, when designing your home screen (an ANSI text file, basically), inserting the codes made it so the home screen would reflect information on the logged in user. Usually when enabled the interpolation happened anywhere, not just in user defined assets.

If someone who has been spanked attempts to tell you that they do not believe they were abused, you have declared their motivation to be either rationalization or denial.<p>Further, when someone is debating whether or not spanking is ""violent,"" they are speaking in the connotation of inflicting injury and harm. They do not mean it in the sense that force, such as beating an egg, is inherently violent.<p>I was spanked by my parents and by a grade school teacher. I think it functioned as suitable punishment in my case, and overall I was under-disciplined. Being told that I am inherently unreliable or unable to make the determination that I was abused or not is irritating and disrespectful.<p>I do believe current parenting consensus is that spanking has the <i>risk</i> (and perhaps tendency) of causing harm, and will avoid it as a method of discipline with my children.",1340675511

If you're selling tickets at a flat rate and a sellout happens in a few minutes that means your tickets were too cheap. Shortages in a market are bad and can be solved with higher prices. Acts that leave surplus on the table are mostly benefiting scalpers not the fans, and it is also part of the reason Ticketmaster can tack on their huge fees. In the internet era there is no reason not to setup an auction system and sell the tickets to the highest bidders.<p>What seems to happen is that acts worry about their shows having too many random rich people and not enough ""real fans"". They think without the super-excitement from the ""real fans"" it would ruin the experience of the show. I'm not sure if that is true, anyone willing to pay a lot of money to attend is probably a real fan, rich or not. But if the bands want to they could allocate a smaller portion of tickets at a lower price using some other method, maybe a lottery, but it's going to be hard to keep the scalpers out.<p>With all the problems with the copyright-based business models fans should actually want their favorite acts to raise prices and make as much money as they can from touring, instead of the money going to middlemen.",1340674362

Also ""The Art and Craft of Problem Solving"" by Paul Zeitz and George Polya's ""How to solve it"")<p>Most of the Mathematics in school curriculum is just plug n' chug work at a slightly higher level. Students do not get any insights into how really good problem solvers solve tough problems. Mathematics competitions such as the regional and international olympiads give students an exposure to such type of problem solving, but this experience is limited to a narrow pool of students who through pure serendipity discovered how intellectually rewarding problem solving can be. Perhaps if training materials were more widely available, more students would be able to get a glimpse of Mathematical problem solving at a totally different level.<p>In a previous life, I used to tutor O-level and A-level students in Mathematics in Singapore. The transformation some of them had when exposed to say principles in Polya's ""How to solve it"" was <i>phenomenal</i>.

4159633,comment,4159510,4159556,3,0,ComputerGuru,,,"Actual article text:<p>Orbitz found Mac users on average spend $20 to $30 more a night on hotels than their PC counterparts.\nThe Orbitz effort, which is in its early stages, demonstrates how tracking people's online activities can use even seemingly innocuous informationin this case, the fact that customers are visiting Orbitz.com from a Macto start predicting their tastes and spending habits.\nOrbitz executives confirmed that the company is experimenting with showing different hotel offers to Mac and PC visitors, but said the company isn't showing the same room to different users at different prices. They also pointed out that users can opt to rank results by price.\nJournal Community<p>Orbitz found Mac users on average spend $20 to $30 more a night on hotels than their PC counterparts, a significant margin given the site's average nightly hotel booking is around $100, chief scientist Wai Gen Yee said. Mac users are 40% more likely to book a four- or five-star hotel than PC users, Mr. Yee said, and when Mac and PC users book the same hotel, Mac users tend to stay in more expensive rooms.\n""We had the intuition, and we were able to confirm it based on the data,"" Orbitz Chief Technology Officer Roger Liew said.\nThe sort of targeting undertaken by Orbitz is likely to become more commonplace as online retailers scramble to identify new ways in which people's browsing data can be used to boost online sales. Orbitz lost $37 million in 2011 and its stock has fallen by more than 74% since its 2007 IPO.\nThe effort underscores how retailers are becoming bigger users of so-called predictive analytics, crunching reams of data to guess the future shopping habits of customers. The goal is to tailor offerings to people believed to have the highest ""lifetime value"" to the retailer.\nOrbitz first confirmed Mac users' preferences in October and began working them into the complicated mix of factors that determine its search results. The effect isn't always obvious. In tests performed by The Wall Street Journal, search results for hotels in cities including Las Vegas, Orlando, Philadelphia and Boston were the same for both Macs and PCs. A New York search turned up more expensive hotels for Mac users, but only after the first 20 listed.\nMac vs. PC<p>Top hotels measured by booked-room nights by Mac and non-Mac users in selected cities in May:\nMac users\nLas Vegas -- Excalibur Hotel & Casino\nNew York -- Park Central New York\nLos Angeles -- Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel\nMiami -- Hyatt Regency Miami\nChicago -- Congress Plaza Hotel\nNon-Mac users\nLas Vegas -- Stratosphere\nNew York -- Park Central New York\nLos Angeles -- The Wilshire Hotel\nMiami -- Miami Beach Resort\nChicago -- The Whitehall Hotel\nSource: Orbitz\nOther searches showed more significant differences. A Mac search for a hotel in Miami Beach for two nights in July displayed costlier boutique hotels on the first page of results, such as Sagamore, the Art Hotel and the Boulan South Beach, that weren't displayed on the PC's first page. Among hotels appearing in both searches, some pricier options (such as the $212 Eden Roc Renaissance and the $397 Fontainebleau) were listed higher on the Mac. Overall, hotels on the first page of the Mac search were about 11% more expensive than they were on the PC.\nSimilarly, hotels on the first page of results for Baton Rouge, La., appeared in different order for Mac and PC and were 13% more expensive in aggregate for the Mac search.\nRival travel sites Expedia Inc., EXPE -3.71% Priceline.com Inc. PCLN -2.30% and Travelocity, which is a unit of Sabre Holdings Corp., don't use a person's computer operating system when suggesting hotels, spokesmen said. Apple declined to comment.\nNeil Sazant, president of Sagamore, reacted with a mix of admiration and concern to the algorithm. ""That's incredible, but I wouldn't want to miss out on PC users,"" he said. Mr. Sazant says about 15% of rooms at the 93-room hotel are booked through a mix of online sites like Orbitz and that appearing on the first page of results is important in those searches.\nOrbitz's chief executive, Barney Harford, has made data mining a priority. Shortly after joining the company in 2009, the former Expedia executive opened a small office in Sunnyvale, Calif., and recruited statisticians with backgrounds from eBay Inc. EBAY -2.32% and Google Inc. GOOG -1.89% for a new analytics team.\nDigging into the data, the team found some hotels were far more likely to be booked by Mac users. Nearly half of bookings on Orbitz for the Public Chicagoa high-end Chicago hotel that boasts features such as ""lobby socializing""come from Mac visitors, said Mr. Liew of Orbitz.",1340673243

You're technically right on so much of this but keep coming to Apple-sucks conclusions that I don't feel are warranted.<p>Let's grant this: if malicious code can start executing on OS X as a regular user, it's game over. There are so many ways through the floor it's almost trivial. (the presence of BSD tools being largely irrelevant since there were far easier ways in the door that are guaranteed to be installed)<p>And let's grant this: Apple has been very late in rolling out an explicit malware detection and removal systems.<p>And let's grant this: Microsoft understands what they're up against when it comes to security. Malware damaged the Windows XP install base to the point where it was necessary to stop production on their #1 moneymaker in order to rescue it.<p>I can't support your assertion that Gatekeeper is a power grab. The defaults on 10.8 allow any and all signed software bundles to be installed regardless of where they came from.<p>Mac App Store can at the very least ""prove"" that apps are only able to call public APIs, there's a minor but real financial and logistical barrier to entry, and developers and apps can be revoked. All apps must be sandboxed (for better and for worse) and updates must come through a known source.<p>As for the argument that Apple is doing security by obscurity, I think they've been doing fine. To review the ways I know of to trash a Mac: Drive by web plugin attack, network attack, e-mail attachment attack, tricked into authenticating Installer.app.<p>I think we can all agree that all major OSes are a lot better about controlling ports open by default nowadays.<p>Web: Safari is sandboxed. Flash is sandboxed. Extensions are sandboxed and signed. All out of date flash plugins are purged automatically at system boot. Java has basically been disabled across the entire Mac ecosystem. In-line PDFs are handled by the OS.<p>Disk Mounter refuses to mount known bad .dmgs. Installer.app has a blacklist. Both of these update nightly. System Update will shortly match the default policies and cadence of Windows Update.<p>PDFs are handled by a sandboxed built-in App, short-circuiting the nightmare that is Adobe Acrobat Reader.  There's no AutoRun concept for mounted volumes. ASLR at multiple levels is in use. Signed frameworks are in use. Etc, etc, etc.<p>I'd argue that a Mac out of the box being used by an novice operator is pretty well protected, with more to come. And these novice operators are the ones who do the most damage to software platforms by blindly installing shit. Apple's straightjacket provides better results for them.<p>Finally, iOS: the ivory-est of all ivory towers. Name an app that's done real-world damage, because I haven't heard of one.",1340672701

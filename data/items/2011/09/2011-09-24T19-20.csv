3034188,comment,3033869,3033869,2,0,tzs,,,"> The most expensive apartments per square foot is a 1 bedroom apartment at about $31.50 per square foot (Average: $2,100).  But, the cost of a 4 bedroom apartment is about $25.60 per square foot (Average: $3,200).<p>I am having trouble understanding this. If the average 1 bedroom is $2100 and it is $31.50 per square foot, that would mean the average 1 bedroom apartment is 67 square feet. The average 4 bedroom would be 125 square feet based on his numbers. This sounds way off. Am I misunderstanding him, or did he get the numbers wrong, or what?",1316894084

I list my extra rooms at just under market prices with above market amenities and then select the best people.  They provide me a months deposit and they sign a sublease that clearly states that non-payment of rent for a single month without prior written approval results in automatic cancelation of the lease and eviction (avoiding the long drawn out civil court system).</i><p>This approach works with consulting and picking clients.  If you go for the highest rate you think you can get away with you end up with fewer clients to chose from; sometimes you end up with the one client to chose from.<p>If you price your rates lower you'll (generally) get more potential clients giving you a better choice of who to work with.  Caveat: People are funny, and price sensitivity is funnier still.<p>BTW, it's been years since I had any dealings with NYC housing court, but if it's at all the same then all bets are off even if you have a signed contract regarding eviction.  My recollection is that the courts were <i>very</i> reluctant to evict people, even when they've skipped paying rent for many months.

Also at this public sneer from an editor: Won't developers feel responsible for this?<p>They again, they include javascript files with a copyright from 2007 (<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/rw/sites/twpweb/js/wp_omniture.js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/rw/sites/twpweb/js/wp_omniture...</a>). They source javascript files of 5 lines of length. They forget alt attributes on navigation images. And they wrap their stories in this soup:<p><pre><code>  #wrapperMainCenter, #wrapperInternalCenter, #container, #pagebody, #pagebody-inner, #article, .blog_entry, #c-main-content, #center, .content, .hnews hentry item

That can't be result of a single developer, or even of a single project.<p>There currently is nothing to fix when - to keep advertising and tracking going - you are faced with over 100.000 bytes of third party javascript code (I stopped counting).<p>Next to a complete redesign, a mentality change would be needed. Sure, you can asynchronously load a single compressed and combined core javascript resource just before <body> close.

3034149,comment,3033728,3033728,3,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"Not sure that this really counts as an API, but I'd like a converter between things in my life which require polling and a push sort-of interface.  Here's an example:  I ordered some things from eBay, and I'd like to confirm that they arrived in one piece.  After clicking ""buy it now"", I have to somehow remember to confirm within a couple of weeks that the items arrived.  I used to add a calendar task N days out with a note like, ""ensure delivery of XYZ"".  However, I've fallen off the wagon on this of late.  The fundamental problem is that there is no ebay-originating tickler event which lets me know that it's time to validate delivery.  As an analogy, I think I'd like a way to add cron jobs for my life.  Imagine your phone asking you, ""Hey, did your package arrive?""  If you affirm delivery, nothing more happens. If you say no, a task gets added to your todo list to figure out what went wrong (wife mis-placed package, etc.).  You can also say ""bug me later.""<p>I'm not sure that I've done a good job articulating what I want, in part because I only have a vague notion of what would help me out.  I do know that keeping all sorts of ""polling lists"" in my head (or even in a calendar/todo list) is very stressful.  I'd love to offload the work of remembering this stuff to a trusted assistant.<p>What other things in life are missing async callbacks?<p>- Cancelling X service before it auto-renews next month/year/whatever
- Generally, any task with the word ""confirm"" in it
- Audit-related tasks such as making sure my client writes me a check for the amount I invoiced.<p>One could implement basic ""tickler"" functionality at first without any back-end integrations and then build one-off interfaces for common use cases -- for example, use the eBay API to observe purchases I've made and add ticklers based on the auction's stated delivery dates.  Maybe this service also grabs tracking numbers and digs a level deeper for you.  ""Remember to grab your package from the front porch -- there's a 90% chance of rain tonight!""",1316892935

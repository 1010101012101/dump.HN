Show me anyone (who understands that BI isn&#x27;t lost when someone works) making that claim anywhere.<p>I agree with you that the evidence shows there is not even substantially reduced incentive.  In the case of Mincome in particular, it did show <i>a</i> decrease in hours worked, which is consistent with the claim that you were objecting to - that BI reduces the incentives for work (relative to the same system with no BI).  Asserting that the global disincentive is small and that conditional assistance provides far more disincentive would have been entirely appropriate.  Asserting that there is zero disincentive - without an explanation for why we saw one in Mincome - is not, and your earlier comment was arguing that by asserting <i>remaining</i> incentive was not zero which just doesn&#x27;t make sense as an argument.",1395604780

Once a correct sequence of connection attempts is received, the firewall rules are dynamically modified to allow the host which sent the connection attempts to connect over specific port(s). A variant called Single Packet Authorization exists, where only a single &quot;knock&quot; is needed, consisting of an encrypted packet.[1][2]<p>The primary purpose of port knocking is to prevent an attacker from scanning a system for potentially exploitable services by doing a port scan, because unless the attacker sends the correct knock sequence, the protected ports will appear closed.&quot;<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_knocking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_knocking</a>",1395604778

7454834,comment,7454082,7454593,15,0,acdha,,,"If you read the article again, notice how the fast majority of those millions of dollars have gone to private companies who failed to deliver working systems. Each of those companies passed multiple rounds of competitive bidding, too. The government staff processing things by hand can at least point to a ton of successfully processed requests rather than a complete write-off.<p>Outside of shallow libertarian magical thinking, privatization isn&#x27;t a panacea. Anyone who has worked for or with a large corporation has stories which are at least this bad — the main difference being that you rarely about about the failures unless it leads to a major lawsuit. The usual argument is that you aren&#x27;t required to do business with those companies but … just try to live without insurance, telecommunications, cars, etc. Markets allow you to select the least-bad option but it often takes regulation or changing the problem to make significant improvements. Before someone mentions Google: consider how happy you&#x27;d be if their QA-in-production / no live support mentality was applied to your retirement checks rather than your free email…<p>There are two real problems here: the first is the well-known fact that we&#x27;re still figuring out how to deal with large-scale IT projects, which affects everyone, and the fact that government agencies are significantly blocked from doing things the right way. For the last couple decades, politicians have “shrunk” government by giving jobs to the private sector rather than hiring lazy government workers. What this actually means is that instead of hiring the same person directly they&#x27;re hired at a significant markup – equal or greater pay plus the overhead costs of all of the contracting company&#x27;s staff and profits – and all of the work is pushed into a procurement process which forces you into the worst possible form of waterfall.<p>You&#x27;re not the first person to notice that things aren&#x27;t efficient – and I&#x27;m certain that staff at OPM would agree, given how many of them were quoted saying just that. The solution is easy – allow them to hire good people in house at market rates and give them the needed support / autonomy – but that&#x27;s politically dicey. This and your proposed solution are both likely to fail as long as Congress has a sizable contingent of people who benefit from problems, even those created by their policies, and everyone receives donations from companies which do business with the government. This also won&#x27;t magically go away with privatization, as anyone who has seen large deals go to the company which bought the best lunch can tell you, but at least in the case of the government the details are public knowledge.",1395604755

So taking a full 16 credit load would cost $112 per semester for text books. Regardless of if the course used one, ten, or no books the fee was included. So I paid $7 for text book rental for water polo (1 credit &quot;class&quot; with no books), $21 for an upper level CS course with perhaps 1 book, and $21 for an English class that may have required reading 10 books. We never had to deal with selling the books back since we never bought or owned the books. If after a course, particularly a course in your major, if you wished to keep the book you could by paying for it.<p>EDIT: I have heard that most people would spend $112 on a single course, let alone even a single book. I don&#x27;t think the publishers and text book companies really like(d) my University. Yes, this is in the U.S. too. I think if a school&#x27;s student body comes together and &quot;demands&quot; text book rental they can get it.

Pick a language and _not_ a framework<p>I don&#x27;t need to stress on the 1st point for you. \nRegarding choosing language and not framework, my reason is that too many beginners get caught up in which framework to use debates which basically sidetracks them from the main thing: learning. Also, frameworks do a lot of things for you. For eg, a higher level framework will most probably provide you with login management which would include cookies, sessions etc. While I know it is good to not reinvent the wheel, if you let plugins and framework do most of the heavy lifting, the learning process gets hampered.<p>Without a framework guiding you, you are bound to make mistakes in terms of architecture of your app. But it is fine in the learning process. Knowing what is going on is better than using seemingly magical solutions. Maybe later yes, but for now stick to the basics!<p>I personally started off in PHP. For PHP I&#x27;d suggest Toro microframework. It gives you routing and that&#x27;s it. Whatever language you choose, pick the smallest framework for the maximum learning.

If a country&#x27;s educational mix changes, its position vis-a-vis the world labor market can also change.

Denmark can&#x27;t compete on price, so the idea is to get everyone a high level of education and position the entire country as essentially a high-end consulting/services firm.

This makes people desperate for jobs to the extent that they&#x27;ll generally pay whatever it takes to maximize their job prospects.<p>So, basically you have a situation in which demand for the best possible education is inelastic.  Pretty much everybody wants it and is willing to pay anything they can for it.  If you offer students more money to spend on their education, they naturally will.<p>That means that schools are in the very powerful position of deciding who deserves the privilege of an education.  But, at the same time, they&#x27;re competing with each other for the best students.  If money is no object for the students, you can bet that schools will spend as much as possible to get the &quot;best&quot; students.  Fancy buildings aren&#x27;t just there to impress donors.  They&#x27;re there to impress prospective students.<p>I think MOOCs will help and basic income will help.  High tuition isn&#x27;t a problem if you don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to go to school.

Access to information.\n2. Directed learning.\n3. Time to explore your own interests.\n4. Research facilities.\n5. Qualifications.<p>Access to information is easy enough outside college (books, Internet, etc...). Lack of research facilities is only really a hindrance if you&#x27;re trying to study a hard science or engineering. Time to explore your own interests is easy enough without college, in the worst case you could borrow money, not pay college tuition fees, and study just as long.<p>So that leaves two remaining benefits (and arguably only one benefit to real learning); directed learning and qualifications. The college system directs you towards the ideas in a field that are deemed as key to understanding the subject more fully. Having access to mentors gives the students guidance and reassurance. Qualifications are seen as the reward for the work (not by everyone, it&#x27;s possible to study for the fun of it too, but that just preaching to the choir on a site like HN).<p>The requirement for colleges for certain qualifications would be easy to fix. The main factor that is lacking from non-college learning is the directed learning aspect. It can be fun to learn a little bit of everything, but colleges can bring you up to speed in something quicker because of this guru-led focus. If/when mavens from a field are simple to interact with, efficient learning is unlocked. The &quot;hacker&quot; community is a great example of this, we have all the resources at our disposal, including access to the leading lights, no other group has it quite as good.

7454789,comment,7449728,7452174,5,0,zackmorris,,,"I apologize in advance for how long this got :-/<p>At first I was signed up on freelancer.com as well and did several ~$150 contracts where I could bid/get picked/do the work/get paid practically the same day, which helped my psyche.  I also did a relatively large project on elance.com but unfortunately didn&#x27;t get paid for it due to disputes over milestones (the customer kept adding to the to do list), which is what led me to the escrow on odesk.com.  I did a few fixed rate contracts but found my time management skills were not exactly stellar so switched to hourly for a while and found some peace knowing I was getting paid for my time like a regular job.  Once I got back in the swing of things, I tended to prefer fixed rate again for the freedom it provides.<p>For odesk.com, I put a couple of pics in my portfolio, got a decent score on a skills test, and had some credentials in my education and employment history.  But ya, at first I was not getting any invites and was bidding on several contracts at once without any bites.  On the surface, a lot of the bidders look very experienced and I just couldn’t see how to compete with them.  I guess what changed is that I stumbled onto some contracts where the client was frustrated with the quality of previous work, and I took the plunge and cleaned up their apps for them.  It was an eye opener because I saw the kinds of tradeoffs that are made under low budgets.  It wasn’t that any individual aspect of the code was bad, but more that it was a hodgepodge of different approaches all mashed together, that broke the don’t repeat yourself (DRY) principal, had no separation of logic and interface, was full of memory leaks, just on and on.  The code had been written overseas for a really low rate and so several people had been banging away on it just trying to get it done.  It was kind of remarkable, in a way, but not the kind of code that could be easily reused.  So it hit me that the reason a high hourly rate is worth it is that a client can either choose to pay a team to follow good coding practices (which costs time = money) or pay an experienced developer to do it and avoid the broken telephone game.  There really is no free lunch, and I think that clients understand that before developers do.  So eventually I threw up my hands, realized I couldn’t fight the laws of economics, and “reluctantly” raised my hourly rate.  I tried $30/hr for quite a while because that’s the overtime rate for a typical $20/hr programming job in Idaho and I don’t think a contractor should bid below 1.5 times the salary they desire (due to down time etc).  So your contracting rate will be some multiple of the going hourly rate in your location.  I also stopped being anxious about it, because I knew what the work entailed, so I wrote my bids in a conversational tone, just saying roughly what would be involved and not making any huge promises, and even saying where complications might come up, allowing for contingiences.  That worked pretty well and I started getting more hours in and receiving invites from clients that weren’t looking for bargain basement code.  It was kind of weird though to be charging more but not seeing it in my bank account, and I was having a lot of lean months.  I hadn’t really factored in the hours I spent mulling over the code in my subconscious.  So I came to terms with the fact that I was having trouble getting in more than about 4-6 billable hours per day, even though I felt like I was working all of the time.  So I went ahead and just accepted that I’d average 25 hours per week and raised my rate again to ~$50/hr to account for the research I inevitably did but wasn’t charging for directly.  I found that it alleviated a lot of the dread I was feeling when I thought about getting started working each day.  For me, it was never about the work, but battling my own tendency towards distraction and procrastination.  That was the point where I started getting more interesting contracts that were actually a pleasure to work on.  I had been in fight or flight mode for so long that when the survival instinct died down, coding seemed to feel like a natural thing to do again and it was much easier to get in the zone.  It was like picking up a good book after not reading for a few years.  It had never occurred to me that clients had been going through this exact scenario in reverse thousands of times around the world, had felt frustrated and arrived in a similar place.<p>I really wish someone could have told me all of this, but I probably wouldn’t have heard it anyway.  And in fairness, I made a lot of mistakes, for example after my six month contract last year at a higher rate, I went back down to $30/hr thinking that I had to do that to get seen.  It wasn’t the case at all though, and trying to beat the laws of physics just set me back again.  So I went back to my current rate and things have been good.  At some point I will probably raise my rate again because I’m noticing that the gun.io contracts are priced higher than I’ve been charging (probably due to location) and I need to plan for the future, having a family etc.  Also writing this out now, it sounds a little out there, so I want to emphasize that it’s just the same programming any of us have been doing.  I spend 80% of my time scouring the web for the answers, mostly on stack overflow, and 20% of my time actually typing.  I normally accomplish one item on my todo list per day, maybe two or three if they are small.  And I’ve come to terms with the fact that any estimate I make must be tripled, so that what I think will take two weeks will actually take six.  That’s been a bit of a blessing in disguise though, because I know that to actually finish something in two weeks, it means I can’t write much code.  It puts the emphasis on finding open source projects that do what’s needed, or wiring up the logic in Interface Builder (finding whatever run of the mill solution works with Apple’s human interface guidelines, instead of trying to code around the issue).  Also I keep a large notes file, for example tips like “~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles” contains Xcode’s provisioning profiles, so when I’m using a client’s developer credentials I can trash mine and not spending hours trying to get things working that should already work.  If you can get to a good setup and know that you can deliver, it makes it a lot easier to bid.  So go ahead and try for some smaller/easier contracts at first and if you find you are finishing ahead of schedule, spend the extra time making it top notch for the client.  Someone might hear about it through the grapevine and look you up.  It helped me a lot to stop thinking about competing with other contractors, or even just satisfying the client, but instead imagine the end user and what they will get out of the work.  I think that’s about it, but I wouldn’t want to leave out the fact that having a cool game in my profile and a few lets just say “interesting” blog posts probably helped as much as anything.  Those are somewhat based on luck though and wouldn’t be much to talk about without the fundamentals.  Also follow your nose a bit if you know someone in the business.  I’m a bit isolated out here and I could have saved a lot of time if I lived in more of a tech city.  If you do your homework and also put yourself out there, things will work out.",1395604310

7454754,comment,7454437,7454437,6,0,AaronFriel,,,"The solution though, isn&#x27;t to stop providing money to students for college. If you don&#x27;t have Pell Grants, Stafford loans and the like, lower income bracket individuals would never be able to afford college. There is a simple fact: I could not pay my way through my Midwest university education without these things. I will graduate and be in debt, but I&#x27;ll be better off having done it. Certainly the experience is worthwhile.<p>The solution though, as some people propose, is not to end subsidies for lower income individuals. I see several people putting forth the argument that people are the most efficient at allocating money for themselves. That is not true except in an Ayn Rand novel. If people were so rational, <i>everyone</i> would go to college because the expected value of college still dwarfs the cost of college. Even for those individuals who would graduate with a significant amount of debt, it is far more worth it to have a degree than not.<p>So, how would a society reduce the cost of college education without removing the supports that enable low income individuals to enroll? Instead of giving colleges free money, we need to re-orient our structure of providing support for students that need it so that the college has the right incentives. For example, tying the cost of college to graduate&#x27;s earnings.<p>Right now, a university gets money merely for pursuing higher levels of enrollment. There is no financial incentive for the university to involve students in student organizations, in leadership roles in their community, in politics or in networking. There is a tenuous link between those activities and pursuing alumni programs, but from what I&#x27;ve seen, alumni programs are a post-hoc solution to funding. A university sees an alumnus has done very well, and seeks to share in their wealth.<p>Let&#x27;s simplify: the cost of a college education is 3-5% of aggregate gross income for the rest of your life. People who go on to be tremendously successful will benefit their university, and the university will have an incentive to churn out more tremendously successful people. This tax could be enforced by the IRS, automatically deducted in most cases, and manually reported elsewhere.<p>Now no one has to worry about the stress of student loans, and universities have every incentive to provide the highest quality education possible to maximize the value of their students. No more flooding the rosters of the university with under- and unqualified adjuncts in order to support higher enrollment numbers at lower costs to pad the pockets of administration.

There aren&#x27;t all that many jobs at the top end of the scale and even fewer will be non-managerial spots which means that your sales-pitch for putting up with bureaucracy and political meddling starts with a significant pay cut for high demand professions.

Community colleges are the primary target for this type of fraud, since we have open admissions.<p>The federal government is not okay with this, so they instituted a system of mandatory reporting where we have to keep track of whether or not a student shows up during the first few weeks.

That will give a pretty good gauge on what it will be like.<p>I would also ask why they chose to open up remote positions. Is it a last resort to get people hired or is it because they just care about the quality of the hires. You may or may not get an honest answer here, but I would ask it any way.<p>The other I would ask is what is the primary means of communication in the company. If they say &quot;Campfire&quot;, &quot;Flowdock&quot; or something along those lines - ask how many rooms they have and how active they are. The key here is asynchronous communication, with remote positions come different schedules, removing the need for instantaneous response is nice.<p>Along those lines I would ask about hours that people work, are there core hours or is it 8-5 Pacific time, etc. If there is a rigid schedule, that is a bit of a red flag for me.<p>I would also ask how often the team gets together, this should be a priority and I think once a quarter minimum would be a good time frame.<p>You mentioned a devops role, so this might not be as big of a thing for you, but I like to see them using pull requests (or similar methodology) for feature merging.

Maybe giving people free money for college isn&#x27;t the best idea.<p>There are four ways to spend money:<p>1) You spend your own money on yourself<p>2) You spend someone else&#x27;s money on yourself<p>3) You spend your money on someone else<p>4) You spend someone else&#x27;s money on someone else<p>When you spend your own money on yourself, you are very selective with how that money is spent. Not only do you gain from what you buy, you also lose money you could use to buy other things. The other three situations are ones in which being selective isn&#x27;t as important to the spender.<p>Why does this matter? When people pay for college themselves, we are in situation 1; they have an incentive to choose a college they can afford while still being a great place to learn. When a student gets free money proportional to tuition, they can choose a school that charges ridiculously high rates for tuition. (Student loans are a middle ground. They are still spending money on themselves, but people the age of college students tend to be more frivolous with loans than money they earned, so they are still less interested in the price.)<p>The more students that get free money for college, the higher the cost of college becomes, because the equilibrium price of college gets distorted. If all student aid disappeared tomorrow, then certainly the cost of college would decrease.<p>If colleges get more money, then where does it go? Certainly not directly to education. It goes to fancy buildings to impress donors, and supporting the ultimate cash cow: government research grants. It goes to inflating the administrative staffs and inflating the salaries of the highest ranked members of that staff. If it was possible to pay for college on minimum wage, I wonder why we ever changed the system.",1395602760

To summarize, ECDSA is bad because (in order of gravity):<p>- It requires cryptographic randomness for each individual signature;<p>- As a NIST standard, it is defined over the NIST elliptic curves, which are not particularly implementation-friendly;<p>- The standards give little to no guidance on implementation issues;<p>- It is slower than necessary, requiring inversions during signing.<p>DSA was a step backwards from the Schnorr scheme, which was the superior option at the time. The blog post (but not the ed25519 paper) seems to forget that Schnorr was never practically adopted due to patent issues, similarly to IDEA, OCB, and many other schemes left on the patented algorithm wasteland. Legend goes that the DSA was designed with the express purpose of avoiding Schnorr&#x27;s patent, while still resulting in a similar scheme. Since the patent expired in 2008, this is no longer a concern, and certainly not for a signature scheme designed in 2011.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/ed25519-20110926.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/ed25519-20110926.pdf</a>",1395602699

I work a full time way above minimum wage and two things make it hard for me at school. a) tuition is a beast but at least my job as some reimbursement – though it pays for a semester 6 hours. b) the school barely has any classes geared towards someone who works. I know I could have gone to school at a technical school I did that years ago and I don’t recommend it. I went back over 5 years ago and did community college first. I received my Associates and that allowed me to transfer right into a four year institution as a junior. But every class that I need now about half are never taught until after 10:00 am and before 3:00 pm. Guess what I have to be at work for my job. Now my company supports me going to school but its almost like the school doesn’t support me going to work. They state they have an Adult Ed center where I can get help but guess what it closes at 5:00 pm?!? I don’t understand how you are supposed to have an AE center to help people who work but then you are not open to help them when they need it.<p>I almost feel penalized for not working at night but how can I give up (and really why should I give up) working at a great job. The school states that they have more evening classes for the Grad students but what about us Undergrads don’t we need evening classes? At least back in the 90′s (when I should have been in school), and in CA, I could have taken every Undergrad course at night. It would have taken me 6 – 7 years to earn a BS in Computer Science now I’m on year 8 and I still have a couple years to go at this rate.<p>Why am I being penalized? is the real question…oh and I’m earning straight A’s and I’m on the Chancellor’s/Dean’s list.

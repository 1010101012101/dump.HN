5875130,comment,5873760,5874551,2,0,toyg,,,"The removal of aristocracy and the establishment of a Republic were extremely radical acts. Even in countries like England, where the merchant classes were on a dramatic rise and parliamentary rule was expanding in scope (and for which it was seen as a wildly anarchic state by most continental nobility), aristocracy was still fundamentally dominant in many areas of life -- which is why there was an American revolution in the first place: non-aristocratic colonists were excluded from most political and military appointments in the Kingdom.<p>The fact that the founding fathers didn&#x27;t have a holy call to abolish private property doesn&#x27;t mean they weren&#x27;t &quot;radicals&quot; -- that&#x27;s a revisionist view with modern undertones.<p>(and on the bloodless, I can assure you that the Civil War was as bloody as most revolutions. It was exactly out of horror for the consequences of that event that most English political movements self-moderated themselves since then, trying to maintain their fights mostly inside the boundaries of parliamentary rule.)",1371142744

It would be amazing if some hacker would come along and figure out a cheap way to keep heavy metals from leaching out of industrial sites into water supplies. But in the meantime, maybe we could use some hackers that used their skills to help raise public awareness of the issue, put pressure on governments to stop cutting their environmental disaster cleanup budgets, etc?<p>I agree with jdietrich on this point: hacker skills are an incredibly big lever. The skills that programmers have: being able to decompose problems into constituent parts, apply reasoning to solve those sub-problems, and combine the solutions into a working whole, are skills that can be leveraged in any facet of life. Combine that with the ability to pitch (a skill which hackers turned entrepreneurs must develop), and you have someone that can contribute meaningfully in lots of different domains, even if they don&#x27;t end up making a world-changing invention.",1371142556

Essentially, the former is controlled by individuals too paranoid to allow for any initiative on the part of individuals under their command, while the latter actively encourages initiative on the part of commanders and dog-faces (grunts). One side effect of this is that German soldiers get away with much less deferential behavior. The result are seen both in previous battles between the two, and with the conflict against the Lizards (invaders from another planet with a much more restrictive bent than even the USSR) where the Nazis generally perform much better given their technology.<p>I wonder if a similar level of encouraging initiative exists in technology due to the fact that there&#x27;s a low ceiling on how far you can pass most decisions up before running into nontechnical persons. Looking at it from another side, technical careers might allow for more initiative simply by the ability to enter the market via unconventional means.<p>Unconnected to the above, it seems to me that these sort of leaks are easier to perform versus a lot of political actions especially with the technical skills of leakers. Leaks&#x27; effect per unit of time to follow through surpasses most anything else I can think of. The only real downside is the resultant criminal penalties.

He did not receive any.<p>There is a program that he signed for called the &#x27;X-ray&#x27; program (18X). It affords the enlistee a pipeline directly to Special Forces Assessment and Selection (SFAS). There is no faster way to go to SFAS than the 18X program.<p>The 18X program begins with 16 weeks of Infantry training followed by 3 weeks of Airborne school. This is not Special Forces training, however. It isn&#x27;t even around Special Forces personnel- not even in the same state. Those 19 weeks encapsulate the period of time leading up to his &quot;training accident&quot; that resulted in his separation.<p>Had he completed Infantry OSUT and Airborne, he would have been sent to a 4 week preparation and conditioning course and then given a slot for SFAS (which is another 3 weeks). At that point, he STILL would have had ZERO Special Forces training. He&#x27;s only been assessed for toughness and fitness generally speaking. Were he selected, he would begin the Special Forces Qualification Course (SFQC). During the time he enlisted, had he actually entered the SFQC, he would have begun with a preparation course for Small Unit Tactics (3 weeks). The closest to Special Forces training he&#x27;d have at the conclusion of that course would be land navigation and patrolling. No guerrilla warfare. No survival school.

A language doesn&#x27;t need to be perfect, it just has to be &quot;good enough&quot; AND meet a few other pragmatic criteria:  availability of libraries, documentation, compilation speed, whatever it might be.<p>That said, Java also strikes me as a good choice for things like text mining, machine learning, data mining, etc.  It also fits well where there&#x27;s an emphasis on integrations with other systems, but that is, again, partly down to the availability of libraries.

A lot of plugins like and love very open folder permissions so they can write stuff everywhere. Be very careful with changing permission on core Wordpress stuff! If for instance you give the web-server write permissions to the core, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time. This is made worse by the fact that many people are used to using the wp-admin &#x27;upgrade&#x27; functionality. In my view this is beyond awful. A lot of WP exploits would be made much harder by just not allowing this and manually upgrading the Wordpress core. It&#x27;s very easy anyway.<p>Second: Disable the following PHP functions in php.ini on the server hosting Wordpress<p>disable_functions = exec,passthru,shell_exec,system,proc_open,popen,curl_multi_exec,parse_ini_file,show_source<p>You can just add that line anywhere in the php.ini, restart apache (or php-fpm if you&#x27;re using that) and you&#x27;ve suddenly blocked 99% of the Wordpress and greater PHP attacks against your server. Essentially you&#x27;ll run across some PHP scripts eventually that want one or more of those permissions. If they do, run them on a server separate from Wordpress and also keep the application way up to date (or you&#x27;ll have a bad time).<p>Third: Install and keep this handy <a href=""http://wpscan.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wpscan.org/</a><p>WPScan allows you to do a URL/folder based wordpress scan looking for vulnerable files, wordpress versions and plugins.

I&#x27;m relatively partial to Java, for example, although I despise PHP.<p>That said, there are fair criticisms of both Java and PHP, and hackers can sometimes run towards being obsessive over details and over analytical.  So the extent to which Java is verbose because of the required boilerplate for, say, getters and setters, offends the aesthetic sense a lot of people have.  Likewise, Java is seen as &quot;less powerful&quot; because it lacks some features (multiple inheritance, etc.)<p>My take on Java is this: I don&#x27;t like the <i>language</i> per-se as much as I like, say, C++.  But in pragmatic terms I can get a shit-ton more usable work done in Java, because it had binary compatibility for libraries from day 1, which meant that creating and distributing libraries in Java is dead simple, which led to an ecosystem where Java has libraries for damn near everything.  And the JVM is nearly ubiquitous, running on almost every platform known to man.   And since I learned Java back when it was still fairly new, it just happens that <i>I already know it</i>, it does most everything I need, and has libraries for everything under the sun and then some.  Pragmatically speaking, it&#x27;s a great choice, at least for the kinds of problems I tend to find myself working on.<p>Of course, the great thing is, no one is limited to just one language.  I can fall back to C, C++ or Python if needed... and I actually do most of my coding in Groovy these days - but I consider Groovy to just be &quot;a better Java&quot;.  All of that said, I have an ambition to dive deeper into a number of other languages (Erlang, Haskell, Go, Scala, Clojure, R among others) but just rarely have time to go off and spend time with that stuff.  That&#x27;s the downside to having a dayjob and a startup I guess... time to do purely exploratory, &quot;fun&quot; stuff is a little limited.<p><i>why do hackers seem to hate the most popular languages?</i><p>I&#x27;d argue that most don&#x27;t, and that you&#x27;re hearing from a vocal minority.  The people who find Java, PHP, COBOL, whatever perfectly usable, don&#x27;t have a reason to voice it to the world. They just quietly sit back and do what they&#x27;re doing.

If two founders raise, say, $500k, under most circumstances they&#x27;ll work a lot harder and earn a lot less than just working for Amagoobooksoft as engineers.  (Remember, it doesn&#x27;t magically become <i>their</i> money.  They&#x27;ll be expected to spend it on employee salaries, and employees are much, much more expensive than anyone who doesn&#x27;t have employees thinks they are.)

Broadly speaking: &quot;Make lots of bets, lose lots of bets, but have some money invested in [without loss of generality: Google]&quot; <i>is, in broad strokes, the model</i>.  Note that there is no reward for being original.  Google wasn&#x27;t.  (&quot;Another search engine?  Please.  And their portal is much worse than Yahoo&#x27;s.&quot;)  Facebook wasn&#x27;t.

Graduated from a good school, worked for one of a few firms with known high hiring bars (AmaGooBookSoft, etc), had a high-impact role at a previously successful startup (first hire or first VP engineering at a company which exited or is a shoe-in to do so, etc), etc etc.<p>+ They are clearly capable of shipping great product.  What makes a great product?  Um, investors &quot;know it when they see it&quot;, but suffice it to say that high-caliber design is very big right now.<p>+ Traction.  In brass tacks: $X0,000 of monthly recurring revenue or millions to tens of millions of free users but <i>growing fast</i>.  Less at early seed stage, but you should ideally be able to demonstrate it in micro-scale.  (e.g. If you can show $1,000 of ad spend got you 4 customers and their LTV is probabalistically above $1,000 then you&#x27;re in a <i>much</i> better position than if you can&#x27;t, even if $4,000 doesn&#x27;t really ring any bells for investors.)<p>Now, let&#x27;s contrast this to a hypothetical guy.  Guy has big dreams.  Guy probably has not shipped a product.  If Guy has shipped a product, Guy got 20 people to look at it once, but no one still uses it.  Guy lives in the Midwest.  Guy graduated from a respectable (but not name-brand) school.  Guy worked has worked the last few years as a freelancer.  Guy has not convinced a second guy to join him on his crazy adventure.  Guy has an idea which Guy thinks is awesome but which Guy has not succeeded in actually selling to 10 customers or instantiating on the desktops or home screens of several thousand users.<p>Guy will have a <i>very, very</i> difficult time raising funding.",1371139407

Apple changes the way it thinks (and iOS devs should think) about the UI and the application contents. Content now receives the most prominent position and UI chrome goes into background. Apple also promotes the &quot;depth&quot; (anyone calling iOS redesign &quot;flat&quot; has no idea that they is talking about and is not worth listening).

It means that kids can learn the core skills and values, like leadership, discipline, teamwork, and wilderness survival, and receive recognition for it, even if their parents&#x27; faith, political leanings, or goals aren&#x27;t aligned with the National Council.<p>I hope the Council leaves it up to the individual troops as to whether they admit girls (or boys, for that matter).

10612611,comment,10606852,10611939,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">  It&#x27;s not that basic income discourages work more or less, but that it evens out the marginal tax rate. This might be a good or a bad thing, but your original post contains no argument either way.<p>Because the marginal tax rate is a separate thing. You can raise the money however you like. Tax the rich, tax the poor, tax securities derivatives, print lots of money, it&#x27;s a separate consideration. What a basic income does is dramatically simplify the welfare system so that when you balance the other side of the ledger you can better see what you&#x27;re looking at.<p>It may then also make sense to simplify the tax system and impose a uniform rate on everyone (because the level of redistribution of wealth can now be trivially set by adjusting the amount of the basic income), but there is no inherent reason why any other method of raising the money could not be used instead. Even in that case a basic income is preferable to the existing system of ad hoc means tested welfare programs.<p>> I think the main argument behind the current system is that low income people need the money, and therefore are less affected by the marginal tax rate.<p>There are three points here.<p>First, if these people need the money so badly, is it really good policy to be imposing high marginal tax rates on them, regardless of whether they&#x27;ll bear it because they have to?<p>Second, the people we currently take benefits away from are not the lowest income people (who do qualify for the programs), they&#x27;re the low-middle income people who only just barely don&#x27;t. If the true consideration is to collect from people who will most be forced to work anyway then shouldn&#x27;t we be sticking it to the even poorer people who have even less choice? (Of course this runs right back into the first point.)<p>And finally, if these people need the money so badly then preventing them from earning as much by working legitimate jobs that report their income will cause more to turn to off-the-books income like dealing drugs and stealing in order to make ends meat. Presumably that isn&#x27;t the work we want to maintain an incentive for.",1448247237

My wife led a troop that did all their meetings at a GS camp where they usually cooked over a campfire as part of each meeting.<p>The biggest blow to Girl Scouts is how they&#x27;re organized. They&#x27;re almost always single-age troops, which means there&#x27;s no scout-to-scout mentoring and there are a lot less scouts per unit. It&#x27;s much harder to keep a troop alive as the girls get older and there&#x27;s a lot of consolidation. It&#x27;s hard to grow new leaders when you only have a dozen parents involved in each unit. Then when a troop breaks up or ages out, the leaders almost always leave scouting.<p>I&#x27;ve been told it&#x27;s possible to have a single Girl Scout unit with multiple ages, but I&#x27;ve never seen that. The best I&#x27;ve seen is a couple individual troops that share a common meeting time and place.<p>For example, my daughter&#x27;s been in two Girl Scout troops. One is &quot;huge&quot; especially for high school aged girls and has maybe 15 girls from 13 to 15. That troop has had 3 official leaders in the 8 or so years it&#x27;s been around. Her other troop folded once it dropped to three girls.

Pop science treatments often say the redshifts are due to the Doppler effect, but that&#x27;s sloppy terminology. The redshift doesn&#x27;t really tell you &quot;how fast&quot; a distant galaxy is moving away (although the pop science treatments talk as if it does); what it really tells you is how much the universe has expanded since the galaxy emitted the light you are seeing. So if we&#x27;re seeing light from a quasar at redshift z = 1, the universe has expanded by a factor of 2 (i.e., a factor of 1 + z) since that light was emitted. And the cosmic microwave background has a redshift of about 1000, so the universe has expanded by a factor of about 1000 since it was emitted (for redshifts this large, 1 + z and z are pretty much the same).<p>As far as &quot;strong proof&quot; that the redshifts are in fact due to the expansion of the universe, and not some other cause, see Ned Wright&#x27;s cosmology FAQ for a good discussion:<p><a href=""http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmology_faq.html#QZ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmology_faq.html#QZ</a>",1448247028

It can go either way depending on what is going in your company and market.<p>I would consider a few things before making your choice:<p>* Likelyhood of Pivot while Repurposing Codebase<p>Obviously, people don&#x27;t just go into a startup thinking that they are going to pivot and they aren&#x27;t easy to predict because it means something unexpected is working well. Your architecture should allow for services and components to be broken out, e.g you will suffer massive technical debt if you want to pivot a service that is dependent on a schema based mysql database with a very rigid data model. All of this is set up on docker instances with crazy services and held together with a staple gun.<p>If you want to carve out a small service that is working, it will be impossible as it is inextricably tied to your bloated deathmachine. Death will quickly catch up before your revenue does if you have to port and rewrite your entire application and redeploy it. Make sure you can be sort of agile, in the sense that you at least have a componetized modular structure for services large enough to charge for.<p>* No One Likes Your Product<p>If your product is not great and no one wants it, having an immaculate and eloquent codebase will kill you as well. Something that does a great job performing a task no one will pay for is also negative.<p>my 0.02, tolerate technical debt at the micro level, but never at the macro level. E.g you can do refactoring if you need to, your code is not extremely dry, there are plenty of optimizations available but your code/functions work.<p>DO NOT TOLERATE IT AT THE MACRO LEVEL\nYou used the wrong tool, are trapped on the wrong database structure, your application is extremely unstable because of a major design choice, etc.<p>Lot&#x27;s of small errors are better than a few big ones.",1448246735

I think Chicago&#x27;s is comparable in some ways -- the biggest differences being you have a more mature ecosystem and more funding, and some huge startups which we definitely don&#x27;t have.<p>I&#x27;ve seen management-level people come in without background experience that handle the managerial parts of their job well.  I&#x27;ve seen some people get promoted from head of whatever to their first management position and become not good at both.  However, managers with prior management experience at a startup seem to be the best bet.

No matter how it&#x27;s delivered if it walks and quacks like a duck it&#x27;s a duck.<p>This is a bullet straight at Netflix and all other OTT services and the following Comcast rep to consumer conversation will go as followed....<p>Customer service rep, &quot;Sure you can use Netflix and enjoy through any Internet device, but your going to have to be concerned about going over your monthly cap, which can get costly.&quot;  &quot;Though with our Stream TV you don&#x27;t have to worry about that, you can stream all you want to your personal devices and it will never cost you more per month.&quot;<p>Awful.. anti-competitive ... needs to be shot down now!",1448244150

You can&#x27;t calculate micrograms if the blotter dosage is unknown, lab testing is needed for that.<p>> if it&#x27;s in liquid form, I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s already in some volumetric dosing<p>Yes, just take a smaller dose then.<p>> Lab tested you say... not convenient as in I can&#x27;t just go to a lab and tell them &quot;hey I need to be trippin so can you check these blotters&quot;?<p>Here in my country I can... this kind of services are available for free in some European countries.<p>Energy Control in Spain provides this to foreigners for a relatively small fee.

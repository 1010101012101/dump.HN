Groupon, despite all it's criticisms does that. It gives people a deal on local goods and services. Mint helps them get a better overview of their finances.

In fact, I think some of these tools serve people in places like these better and, at least in the case of Groupon, may do more for a merchant in a small town than a big city.

2637416,comment,2635572,2637232,3,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"""the study of algorithms""<p>Well, can do what Knuth did in TACP.  There he did a lot with combinatorial formulas.  To make much more progress, will have to get serious about math.  E.g., the leading question in algorithms is just P versus NP, and that is now darned serious math.  Don't attack that or even parts of it without a good background in math.<p>Other new and challenging questions in algorithms promise to need math for progress.<p>As I look at algorithms in 'advanced computer science', commonly they want to treat optimization.  Tilt!  Optimization is a huge field from applied math, operations research, and electrical engineering.  There is deterministic and stochastic optimal control, Kalman filtering, integer linear programming, and much more.  It's darned good applied math, and the math background I outlined is needed.<p>""numerical analysis""<p>That's a field of applied math.  E.g., quickly get into advanced parts of matrix theory.  E.g., consider R. Horn's books.  E.g., quasi Newton quickly becomes an exercise in matrix norm theory.  Long one of the more important tools in numerical analysis has been functional analysis.  Likely the leading reason to pursue numerical analysis is just to get solutions to partial differential equations, and don't go there without a good background in math and likely the corresponding mathematical physics.<p>""compilers, computational reasoning, automated proofs""<p>For the last two, they are just fields of applied math.<p>""Data mining and AI""<p>The way computer science pursues these two, they are nonsense fields.  The first should be just mathematical statistics, and for that the background I gave in probability is crucial.  E.g., will want to know sufficient statistics, and that is based on the Radon-Nikodym theorem, and that is graduate pure math.<p>For AI, if someone can write a computer program that really has 'intelligence', fine.  If all they use are intuitive ideas, good for them.  But so far, the field of AI is very far from this goal in spite of decades of DARPA funding.<p>For now, if want a system that solves a problem well enough to look 'intelligent', then just engineer the system with the usual role for applied math.  I gave a paper at an AAAI IAAI conference with the ""25 best applications of AI in the world"", and the best applications, really, were just good engineering.<p>""Systems, especially performance testing.  Needs some statistics, but it's not hardcore math.  No more than psychology or economics.""<p>For some simple applications, yes, can just borrow statistics from the social sciences.<p>But for progress, it's back to ""hardcore math"":  E.g., I published a paper on 'performance monitoring', that is, zero day anomaly detection in server farms and networks, and the math was based on some of the more advanced parts of the texts I listed.  Basically I found a collection of multivariate, distribution free hypothesis tests.  The social sciences have been using univariate distribution free hypothesis tests for over 60 years; my work was apparently the first good progress to multivariate distribution free tests.  Multivariate tests are just crucial for analyzing performance data.  I used a finite group (from abstract algebra) of measure preserving transformations something like in ergodic theory.  My work was similar to some of what Diaconis at Stanford has done with exchangeability in distribution free statistics.  This material needs all the background I outlined and more.<p>""Systems architecture""<p>For the future, before we build a large system, we will want the 'architecture' to have some known properties.  We do this for bridges, buildings, dams, ships, airplanes, etc.  So, we will want to do it for systems.  We will want to know about reliability and security, at least.  And we may want to 'optimize', that is, get what we need at minimum price.<p>E.g., consider part of the core of the Internet:  Suppose we are given nodes and flows at the nodes.  Then our mission, should we decide to accept it, is to connect the nodes at minimum cost to provide desired capacity, performance, and reliability.<p>Dean of Engineering at MIT T. Magnanti gave a Goldman lecture at Johns Hopkins on this problem; first-cut it's a super tough problem in integer linear programming.  Actually, it was such problems in network design, and integer linear programming, that got Bell Labs going on the work that resulted in<p>Michael R. Garey and David S. Johnson, 'Computers and Intractability:  A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness', ISBN 0-7167-1045-5, W. H. Freeman, San Francisco, 1979.<p>which is one of the key books early in the problem P versus NP.<p>It is common now to throw together a system, have various intuitive approaches to parallelism and redundancy, and then get a problem and see the whole server farm go south.  Recall that this is just what happened at Amazon a few weeks ago.<p>Maybe some people, say, in national security, finance, or air traffic control would like such things not to happen?<p>A common situation is parallelism that is not more reliable but worse:  E.g., there was a parallel transaction processing system.  The load balancing sent the next transaction to the least busy computer.  Then one day, one of the computers got a little sick, started throwing all its work into the bit bucket, was not very busy, was getting nearly all the transactions, and, thus, killed the whole 'cluster'.  Bummer.<p>Something similar happened with Google's e-mail servers.<p>Instead, we need some theory with some theorems and proofs that provide some guarantees that we are getting the performance and reliability we need.  That work will be mathematical; without a good background in math, don't try.  And, yes, likely the work will need probability such as I discussed.<p>""Best practices.  Software engineering.  Not really mathy.  Not really science either.""<p>Not really computer science research either.<p>""OOP.  Theology?""<p>There have been some connections with category theory, but I'm reluctant to take those seriously.<p>Mostly OOP in practice is simple and works well for some simple things.  Otherwise OOP is not well thought out.  And long OOP was a 'theology'.<p>My old view of programming languages is that they should be designed so that they 'admit' some source code transformations that have some useful properties.  E.g., suppose we have such a language with such properties and have two pieces of code.  Can we use the transformations to check if the two pieces of code are equivalent?  So, right, we will have 'equivalence classes' of code.  Some of these will do better on processor time, main memory usage, exploitation of multiple cores, etc. than others.  So, with some code and these transformations, we have an optimization problem:  Transform the code to equivalent code with the 'resource' properties we need.  Sounds like math to me.<p>""But there are things to study that aren't just math, even in the field of computer science.""<p>The problems are from computer science.  But the good solutions are necessarily applied math because our civilization knows no other way to proceed.  This situation is much that same as in all fields that have been 'mathematized', especially theoretical physics.",1307632906

Unforeseeable bit-copying errors caused by cosmic rays and similar circumstances, which do exist, probably account for less than a one out of every billion actual bugs/crashes experienced out there. When a bit is toggled by a cosmic ray in memory, if it hits program memory, it will with a significant frequency crash your program.<p>Most bugs you experience daily (Word or your favorite game/appp crashing, etc...) are caused by actual software errors in overly complex systems with many dependencies. Multithreaded-coding errors can often account for many of those, but not only, complex system with many layers and complex dependencies can often hide obscure behaviors that can cause crashes in a given machine if, for example, you have a weird combination of disk drivers, file system code, and an antivirus hooking and acting on every filesystem read or write.<p>When, for example, a Word plug-in makes a call to Word's object model, this goes through easily 10 software layers until it reaches its target, some of these layers being configured via the flaky Windows registry, others going through jumps from VM-based to native code using weird ""marshalling"" techniques, etc... in these cases, you may encounter buggy behavior in any one of the 10 layers, or in a combination of two of them, even if it seems like you are just incrementing a simple counter.<p>Most of the time, though, bugs are caused by the app's own code (your own code): careless code, dangerous practices, lack of solid control-flow design, etc... if you write really good code, it's unlikely you will have many support issues. Only if you are working in some problem-prone area: plug-ins to other complex, often poorly-designed products, code pushing graphics drivers to the max, etc... where you get into ""complex system"" behavior.<p>Even if you use multithreading, if you control all the code, you can write very solid code. If your multithreaded code is perfect, it won't crash. Although it can uncover bugs in third-party libraries, etc... which is why I tend to write only ""worker threads"" with no third-party dependency if multithreading is required.<p>And I think it's very dangerous to warn novice programmers to think that the bug is probably somewhere else.",1307632559

If you do want to wrestle with some kind of crazy-ass music management system, the way that seems to work best to make it so that we can all use whatever we want is to have an underlying interface based on files.<p>Beyond interoperability, tech that's too specific to 'what people actually use their computers for' tends to make it harder to do things that the developers didn't think of; go far enough down that road and computers become about as interesting as TVs.",1307632515

To try and stand out a little bit I created a resume that is pretty non-traditional for a developer, though many graphic artists do similar things. I am just looking for some advice from people who have done the same, or who have a hand in hiring for such places. Is a resume like this a good idea or should I scrap it and stick with a more traditional resume? The design is intended to be printed with no margins, and I believe it will be nice to hand out at seminars/events as well as mail in a nice envelope, though I am worried about the fact that the digital version is not quickly searchable/selectable like a normal doc or PDF.
ANY advice would be greatly appreciated!

Subsequent names wouldn't have good locality, but second and third links to a file are much less common.  If you want other links to the file to have good locality, then simply make a copy, doubling your space requirements.<p>Hard links are useful, and you don't necessarily need to sacrifice locality in the common case, and in the uncommon case you can still choose between good locality, or good use of space and the sometimes useful semantics of two names by which to read or write a file.",1307632149

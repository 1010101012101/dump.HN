One thing I forgot to mention is that this becomes a self-perpetuating cycle by turning those holding the opposing viewpoint into enemies: if you're <i>against</i> torture, you are putting my children in harms way, if you are <i>for</i> gay marriage, you are destroying my family and community, etc.",1336863567

If our level of sexism and sexist behavior is the same as the rest of society, then social skills are irrelevant. If lower social skills magnify existing sexism, then either our level of bad behavior should be much higher or our level of sexism would have to be lower.<p>I think the reason it comes up here is that it's a field that attracts smart, idealistic people who are unlikely to be consciously sexist (but still have a lot of bad behaviors and unconscious attitudes). Another factor is that the low ratio of women makes it easier for sexist and misogynistic subcultures and workplaces to exist.",1336863533

3965439,comment,3964166,3964166,7,0,gfodor,,,"This is an insightful post. I think a stellar example of what you get when you run with this concept and try to use it as a tool to influence others is seen in the right wing propaganda machine in the U.S.<p>Often one has to sit back and wonder how reasonable, decent people can support horrible policies such as banning gay marriage, torture, and so on. At least part of the reason for this is because those in power who want to enact these policies have mastered the art of making them portable outside their own extremist spheres. They do this by ""attaching"" these ideas to more innocent, pure, and (generally) positive beliefs that are universally held by many conservatives, if not all Americans: love of country, love of God, the fear of harm to your children, belief in fairness, belief that hard work begets success, belief in the benefits of family and community, and so on.<p>The magic that makes it possible for decent, loving, hard working people to support things like torture is by making the idea of torture ""portable"" into their worldview, by hanging it onto one or more of these core beliefs. If you don't support torture, you're not protecting your children. If you support gay marriage, you're laying the groundwork for families to unravel. It's all bullshit, of course, but these are the root things people are being convinced of: not that torture is good, or that gay marriage is evil (though it often morphs into that), but that these things are natural conclusions based upon beliefs you already have. It takes the work of an evil genius to figure out how to connect these two things together and make them portable towards groups of people who have otherwise innocent and positive beliefs, but we see it happening every day.",1336863295

In my circle, users have moved distributions to mint and debian, changed to using twm, dwm and xmonad. The despair at unity was caused by the bugs, and the fact that the ubuntu android distro required a proper screen to be utilised properly. It was not caused by the concept, but the implementation. If the user unfriendliness caused by unity was intended to support smartphones and smaller screen devices, why does the mobile unity require an external screen? Baffling!

Investors give little meaning to how much of a founder's own money has been spent on a project, so why burn down your savings?<p>- Learning Python and front-end coding is a great idea. Even if you dont become a great developer, it will increase your understanding of developers and increase your cred with them.<p>- Read lecture 9 in Peter Thiel's Stanford course, and the excellent article posted here on being a ""Growth Hacker"".<p>- Be courageous, fail fast, break things, and enjoy.

It's plausible that Dell outsourced the entertainment to a local Danish agency of some sort, and that to Dell it just looked like ""Mads something, some Danish comedian"". Although Mads Christensen is vaguely notorious in Denmark (for multiple things), afaict this is the first incident that actually made the English-language media, so you'd have to read Danish (or ask someone) to know who he was previously. Though whoever in Denmark recommended/booked him certainly knew who they were booking. Possibly Dell should've exercised a bit more control over the program. Definitely should've reacted more emphatically, though it's not too late to say something now.",1336860474

3965299,comment,3964837,3964837,1,0,gavanwoolery,,,"I would say become an angel investor.  A small amount of money can make a big difference to some people.  Most Y-combinator companies start with under $20k.  If you need help evaluating what companies to invest in, get a multitude of opinions (I will give you an opinion for free, just shoot me an email: gavanw@gmail.com -- I enjoy criticizing companies!).<p>I would recommend investing in companies that most VCs won't fund - namely, game companies (naturally I am biased here).  Games are the ""easiest"" products to monetize and get traction for, assuming you have a capable team that is making something interesting (i.e. not a clone).  Think of it this way: how many users look forward to a particular game coming out?  Now how many users look forward to a given Web 2.0 product?  Kickstarter is hard proof that users are more interested in games than other types of products.  There is a lot of room for innovation in games -- whereas it is very hard to think of good ideas for typical startups.<p>The time it will take you to learn to code well enough to create a decent startup (read: nontrivial) is at least 1 year (and even that is a stretch), and that will cost you maybe 50k depending on the salary you give yourself.  On the other hand, you could buy an experienced software engineer (with 50k + good equity).<p>On the other hand, you can start a business outside of software.  Some of the most obvious businesses make buttloads of money: cleaning services, car washes (I know a guy who runs a carwash and makes over 3 million a year).<p>I am obviously not the leading expert on any given matter, these are just my humble opinions. :)",1336860264

Link anyone? Of course this example further shows that they are indeed quite similar to us in basic psychology.",1204707314
129573,comment,129463,129560,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""Burnout hurts. A lot.""<p>I think this is worth repeating every few days until it is thoroughly internalized.  I burn out every once in a while...and when it happens, my productivity is shot...sometimes for weeks.  I have to be careful to keep exercising every day, spend a reasonable amount of time watching movies or playing music or games and interacting with other people, or a weird sort of do-nothing depression kicks in.  I don't even realize it while I'm working, until it's too late.  I can even be enjoying what I'm doing, and having some satisfaction about results, but if I overdo it, something clicks and the next time I run into anything slightly frustrating/boring/repetitive it's all over and the burnout kicks in.",1204707012

129570,comment,129463,129507,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've never worked more than four days a week for any employer other than myself (usually three, with four and five day weeks popping up occasionally during big projects).  I've always made less money because of it, of course, but from my very first real job, I've always been officially a ""part time"" employee.  All of them occasionally asked if I wanted to go full-time...and I always refused, though sometimes the offers were quite attractive.<p>I've missed a couple of jobs because of this insistence of mine of not working five day weeks, but I don't think any of them would have been a particularly good fit for me, anyway, so no big loss.  If the employer isn't a really good one, other employees could be bothered by one person only working three days a week, though, so I can understand employers being hesitant to hire someone with that requirement.  And, when I begin hiring, I suppose I'll have to think about these kinds of issues more seriously.",1204706652

Eg, the more friends you have on myspace, the better you can advertise your band; the more popular your youtube video, the better you can use it to promote something; same goes for blogs.<p>Of course, the way it's being used here works off of a skill that nearly all of his users are known to have, unlike the youtube example.",1204706594
129568,comment,129316,129316,0,0,TheTarquin,,,"Interesting article.  I went on a real animal intelligence kick a few years ago when I read Eugene Linden's <i>The Octopus and the Orangutan</i>.  The books full of fascinating stories of animal emotion, intelligence, and tool use.  (My personal favorite was the Orangutan who learned how to pick the lock on his cage and kept the improvised pick he used secreted behind his bottom lip, thus allowing him to escape several times before handlers got wise to what he was doing.)<p>On a separate note, Wikipedia may have its flaws, but it certainly excels at giving accessible, digested information on pretty much every conceivable topic.  This is a perfect example of that: a complex topic adequately summed up in a few digital pages.",1204706521

To say anything negative about it, or anything positive about Socialism, is blasphemy and apostasy.  I know there's a rich history behind why this is, but it still surprises me -- no shocks me -- that otherwise intelligent individuals will lose their minds over such issues, much like religious fanatics.  This article above is a good example, and reads like a fundamentalist tract.  Unfortunately, I feel America has become a failed experiment of what happens when Capitalism is not tempered enough.",1204705798

This includes your parent's opinions.<p>I recommend doing something you love even if you make just enough to keep you from starving instead of doing something you hate just because it pays well. But make sure you really love it first. Chances are you'll enjoy it less than you imagine (but maybe still enjoy it enough to justify leaving your job).<p>The guys on the stage look like they're having a lot of fun, but maybe they only do so because it's their job to look like they're having fun. After a while a job is a job and it can start to suck simply because you HAVE to do it.<p>Maybe you can try out your artistic side in your spare time for a while and see how you really feel about it.",1204705797

However, where the help link is now, this causes me to be sent to the Help page each time. This is a minor thing, but I think Hacker News should model usability and move the help link to after the submit button (or set the tab index on the submit button).",1204704006

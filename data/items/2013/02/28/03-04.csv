If Bitcoin just keeps becoming more valuable, serving a role but not circulating as much as other currencies (be they traditional or digital-of-a-post-Bitcoin-design), is that a 'downfall', or just a peculiar kind of success?<p>Bitcoin is like a new form of monetary/economic matter... some lessons from traditional domains may apply, but others not at all.

I graduated from high school only a year and a half ago in Washington, so I would agree that my perception of schools is skewed towards wealthier districts.<p>You don't agree that any student should be allowed to program on computers in the library? It seems like a security issue, whereas in a classroom students would be supervised by a computer science instructor. I'm not saying students need to be hand held, but schools really just don't know enough about programming to open it up. Web development, Flash, and Photoshop could be installed on library computers - they were on a few where I went. Otherwise I totally understand why school district IT would not allow it or fight against it.",1362023934

A fraction of this volume is from people just moving BTC between their different wallets. It is impossible to estimate how large this fraction is. But the reasonable assumption that <i>people are not artificially trying to game this chart by moving coins around</i> leads to the reasonable conclusion that the volume of real transactions is increasing as well.<p>You can look at the USD volume traded on the top Bitcoin exchanges which went, over 1 year, from $200-300k to $1.0-2.5M per day: <a href=""http://blockchain.info/charts/trade-volume"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blockchain.info/charts/trade-volume</a><p>You can look at Silk Road, who went, over 2 years, from zero to $2 million/month of Bitcoin revenues: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/study-estimates-2-million-a-month-in-bitcoin-drug-sales/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/study-estimates-2...</a><p>A Bitcoin casino went, over 6 months, from zero to $0.5 million profits (in bitcoins): <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/01/bitcoin-based-casino-rakes-in-over-500000-profit-in-six-months/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/01/bitcoin-based-casino...</a><p>Bottom line, all the indicators point to increased Bitcoin spending.",1362023895

5296824,comment,5291843,5295903,3,0,Eliezer,,,"Hi!  This is awesome from a technical perspective and was initially fun to play.  Being reset when I died was a major problem, especially when joining for the first time in the middle of a round and playing against players who already had lots of stuff (at which point one tends to die quickly... and then have to start over).<p>I'm not an expert in game design (just psychology) but from a hedonic perspective I <i>strongly</i> suspect that you should not be stripping players of assets when they die.<p>In general, the case for ""punishing"" a player is weak (why cause the user pain?) and punishing them in a way that makes it hard for them to catch up in a highly competitive game is worse.  The ""Death"" counter going up and losing your current position is sufficient incentive not to get killed, or there could be loss of points, or you could <i>maybe</i> strip off a single distance unit from the bombs.<p>In the long run you might want some sort of way for early players to catch up quickly, like drops near a player becoming more frequent when they're less advanced compared to other players.  Meanwhile, ceasing to strip assets when a player dies, or stripping off only a single unit of distance (not number of bombs, having only a single bomb slows down gameplay a lot) will greatly increase game playability.<p>Especially don't strip the ability to kick bombs.  This makes it far too easy for freshly respawned players to be killed.",1362022624

If a site customizes Bootstrap and it looks nice nobody credits it as a 'Bootstrap Looking' site, so as a result it is only when the defaults are used that people really pick up on it.<p>Second, the alternative to a site built with Bootstrap is typically not a beautiful custom designed front end, but a pretty rough looking unstyled, inconsistent mess.<p>Bootstrap is the new baseline for what a website should look like, it should be customized, it can be improved but there is now zero excuse for it looking worse.<p>1 - <a href=""http://www.bootstraphero.com/the-big-badass-list-of-twitter-bootstrap-resources"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bootstraphero.com/the-big-badass-list-of-twitter-...</a>",1362022516

A certain model HP laptop is a small exception, but it's not 100% perfect.<p>From my own personal experience running a Hackintosh on a desktop PC I built myself (using community recommended and tested compatible components), I can say that a desktop Hackintosh can be very stable.<p>However, with a laptop you will be making compromises. The exact compromises vary from laptop to laptop. Usually these will include Wifi, battery life and general power management stuff (hibernate, sleep, etc) and possibly more. For a Thinkpad specifically, I do know that you'll end up needing to use a separate Wifi adapter as the built in one will not work with OS X.<p>To be honest, since you seem dead-set on a Thinkpad (and I don't blame you, I love them myself) I don't know what to suggest, aside from ""don't bother"" which you probably won't find too helpful. I would just caution you, don't set your expectations too high, regardless of what you may read on tonymacx86 or wherever else.

5296730,comment,5296413,5296413,79,0,thejerz,,,"I knew Taylor Swift growing up.<p>Like Ang Lee, for around 6 to 8 years Taylor acted in musicals, sang at festivals, entered competitions, and recorded demos. She was bad at first (sorry Taylor!), but she kept working at it. Every day, she was writing another lyric, or taking another guitar lesson, or auditioning for another play, or switching voice teachers. The reason I knew her was that I went to school with her (she was maybe in third grade when I was in 7th), I acted in plays with her, and I ran sound and make background tracks for her when she was 10 or so. I knew her mom and dad and brother too. I got to see her bildungsroman firsthand.<p>Then came her ""overnight"" success. And the press talked about her like she appeared on planet earth overnight. She was a sensation. All at once, you couldn't walk outside your front door without hearing about Taylor Swift. It was surreal, having know the awkward girl from a few years earlier.<p>But what no one talked about was the years she forewent hanging out with other girls in middle school, watching TV and doing her hair with girlfriends in high school... all of the stuff that normal kids do. Playing sports, going on dates with boys... all of this was sacrificed. For Taylor, and Ang Lee, great sacrifice was made.<p>Success requires an obsession of sorts. You have to say, ""I am going to accomplish this, come hell or high water."" Failure is not an option... it's not even a word in the dictionary. There is only success. The buck has to stop with you; there's no room for blaming other people, making excuses, or avoiding harsh realities. Whatever it takes to be successful, whether that's hiring a speech coach, taking more classes at the university, learning etiquette, doing odd projects, finding a tutor, seeing a therapist, waking up at 6am to exercise... there is no limit. And that's just the point -- there is NO limit on what you have to be willing to undertake to achieve the goal.<p>I've grappled with what I'm going to say for years, but I now acknowledge it as a truism: If you stick with it, you'll be successful. It doesn't matter where you come from, who your parents are, what you know, who you know, or how you look. All that is required is a choice -- a commitment to excellence.<p>Therefore, there's only one rule in making it to the top: don't quit.",1362020911

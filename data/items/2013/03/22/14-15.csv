They're doing things right but they cannot really compete with Chrome on a equal footing because Chrome gets bundled with almost every Java and Flash update and those are installed on 99%+ of PCs. Not to mention being pushed on high traffic sites like Youtube and Gmail and being bundled with some PCs by paying the OEMs.<p>I remember switching a lot of non-techie friends/family to Firefox but I see them using Chrome now. When I ask about Firefox the answer almost invariably is that they didn't know how Chrome got on their PC.<p>Site owners get as much as $1 per Chrome download that they're able to push their visitors to. I don't think Firefox has these kinds of resources against Google trying to minimize how much they pay Firefox by cutting down the middle man and building a moat around their search engine and ad profits. The next good search engine to come by will certainly not be the default on a large percentage of browsers.",1363964367

5423292,comment,5408735,5422092,2,0,sergiosgc,,,"A touch and flee commentary roughly touching many important aspects of identity management, with lots of assumptions with which I disagree. It'd take me a while to deconstruct all of them correctly, so I'll try to aim just for the most important points.<p>Your central point is that, for a given identity, there is a set of emails that map to that identity (N-1 relationship). Moreover, this set is itself volatile, as people add and remove emails to the set that maps to their identity.<p>There is no relation of one person to one email (it is one to many). This was approached during the discussion, and I believe you agree that this is not an issue.<p>There are cases where the relation of email to person is one email to many people. This was approached during the discussion, and it just invalidates the usage of group emails as identity identifiers (stuff like info@example.com). It does not preclude the concept of email as identity identifier. I believe you agree.<p>Where you have a specific point against the usage of email as an identifier is on the fact that the email is volatile. Volatility is a flaw, which must be worked around, but it's not a showstopper. Further, there's absolutely no evidence that a pure identity provider, such as OpenID, wouldn't be as volatile as email. It does not have the scale needed to prove non-volatility yet.<p>I think we agreed on the point about natural/surrogate keys.<p>We then briefly touched the question of identity provider (up to here the discussion was about the identity identifier). I think we agree that the provider must be distributed, hence your reference to OpenID (albeit the reference to FB, which I think was related to the point about natural/surrogate keys).<p>Briefly, in summary:<p>- The identity identifier must map one identifier to one identity. (ok for emails, ok for OpenID, ok for most auth providers such as Google or FB)<p>- The identity provider must be distributed. (ok for email and OpenID, ko for Google, FB and other social networks). Social networks are not acceptable because they are not distributed enough. Were there as many social network providers as there are email providers, on a on open ecosystem, where users could run their own social network on their own domain, social networks would be acceptable.<p>- Identity identifiers must be memorizable by users.<p>And here, on this last point, is the crux of our disagreement. You are of the opinion that, since emails are volatile, users will forget their previous email, or discontinue its service, and will be locked out of access to their indentity on services tied to the email. I am of the opinion that users will never remember (or include in their daily routine) yet another identity identifier (the OpenID URL, or any other identity specific service).<p>The fact of the matter is that space in consumer minds is limited (heck, marketing is a whole field of study on grabbing a share of consumer mind). Being limited, you have two options:<p>a. Aim for the ideal scenario, go for OpenID or other pure identity provider, aim for theoretical perfection, and risk no adoption because users can't be bothered to use it; or<p>b. Use the one identity that already exists, that users already remember, that almost fits the bill, and work around volatility, the only big hurdle, by having the ability for users to change/add/remove emails (identity identifiers) associated with each account. This is the approach of Amazon or Linkedin, for example.<p>Aiming for a), while theoretically optimal, introduces the failure scenario of users going for the other identity that already exists in their daily routine: Facebook/google accounts. This is a catastrophic scenario.<p>Optimum is often the enemy of good.<p>Look: You brought a smile to my face with the reference to a tens millions of users site. It's a vain appeal to authority. I also manage a tens of millions of users site, with both federated and native authentication.",1363964354

5423279,comment,5420094,5422854,1,0,dalke,,,"You might not have observed them because the companies you were associated with were following the law and because you've not researched the topic.<p>I listed several standards which are illegal. It is illegal to prohibit someone to wear a cross necklace while at work (unless it directly interferes with the job). It is illegal to have mandatory maternity leave rules. It is illegal to say that only woman can be cashiers and men can be stock the shelves. These have all gone to court, and been found to be discriminatory and illegal workplace standards.<p>In your view of reality, have you read any of the court cases involving Title VII violations? I listed several for you to review. Is your view of reality influenced by documents like the EEOC compliance manual?<p>""Public discussion of sexual discrimination is not what this woman did""<p>Even if this wasn't a ""public discussion of sexual discrimination"", it can still be a protected action. As I pointed out, the 2nd Circuit affirms that people may ""write critical letters to customers."" That's a protected action even if it isn't 'public discussion', so insisting on both ""public"" and ""discussion"" is too restrictive.<p>So you can't argue that since this didn't fall under your definition of public discussion, therefore it isn't protected. You have to show how what occurred wasn't a protected action under Title VII.<p>""Unless you think that these men were sexually discriminating against Adria when they were talking about the male speakers dongle.""<p>The law doesn't require that the discriminatory behavior be directed towards the person making the complaint. Nor does the law exclude women from complaining about sexist jokes directed towards men. Your objections do not appear to valid exclusions under the law.<p>You say ""This has nothing to do with sexual discrimination or harassment"". The law doesn't require that the claims of sexual discrimination or harassment actually be true. Only that the person who made the claim was well-intentioned and that at least one reasonable person would make the same claim. If there a reasonable person can make the same claim, then the complaint is protected under Title VII - even if it was found to be non-discriminatory.<p>You can say that it's against some unspecified company policy, but the EEOC points out that that reasoning can't be used as pretext. Quoting from <a href=""http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/retal.html#IIpartB"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/retal.html#IIpartB</a> :<p>> Even if the respondent produces evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action, a violation will still be found if this explanation is a pretext designed to hide the true retaliatory motive.  Typically, pretext is proved through evidence that the respondent treated the complainant differently from similarly situated employees or that the respondent's explanation for the adverse action is not believable.  Pretext can also be shown if the respondent subjected the charging party's work performance to heightened scrutiny after she engaged in protected activity\52.<p>Do you really think she would have been fired had there not been ""heightened scrutiny""?",1363964224

Then let me brief you  it basically increases the visibility as well as usability of your business. Having an attractive website is not the only criteria to be successful in your business. You really need your ranking to be high on ranking to the top search engines like Google, Yahoo and Bing. \nYour website is like a mirror of your business and it advertise your services so it is very important that it should be visible to maximum number of people. To make your business achieve higher goals you need to hire a company with amazing reputation in the SEO industry. This field is so popular that so many people have jumped into it, but you cant expect quality from everyone. Still perfection is not delivered by everyone. So you need to be careful while choosing an SEO firm. \nThere are so many Seo firms providing affordable (seo) search engine optimization services. Dont forget to check their work and if you are assured of the quality then you can move a step ahead. There are so many tasks that need to be done in SEO, so you really need few experts to handle all those tasks. What they basically do? They will help you in increasing your targeted traffic; this is the best thing that will happen to your business after you hire reliable Seo firm. Then they also improve the edge of competition. All this will help you in increasing the number of your clients. Its really amazing the way you cut your competition. It will also provide you larger customer base. Millions of searches are conducted every day and just think how beneficial it will be if youll be there on the top of search engines. Very rare people search for their required data on 2nd page. So now you can imagine how important it is.",1363964014

The end-result will be exactly the same as if you did the request 1 or 100 times, including any counters that are part of the entry itself (because those counters would be part of that PUT request body, see below).<p>Also, a PUT request is usually made on a specific, unique resource unless you want to overwrite a complete set.

Harassment shouldn't be defined by a list of taboo subjects or stupid rules. Harassment should mean intentional actions that make someone feel uncomfortable or afraid. That means there needs to be some reasonable leeway made for situations where you don't know you're making someone uncomfortable. It makes sense that we should be careful about the kind of jokes we make directly to people but we shouldn't by default have to assume that someone with absolutely zero sense of humour is listening in.<p>People should be free to make jokes and flirt and do whatever they like at the work place, as long as no-one minds. We have to spend half our life at work, what's the fucking point of having to be a robot the whole time?\nSexual jokes aren't necessarily sexist, nor are they necessarily harassing. Neither is flirting, or kissing or flat out having sex, for that matter. (Might be inappropriate for a work environment, but doesn't have to be sexual harassment, does it?) On the other hand, if you do it in an inappropriate way, looking at someone could be genuinely terrifying harassment. I bet if you were careful and sadistic enough, you could turn any innocuous interaction into something that, over time, makes someone feel deeply uncomfortable.<p>Imagine if we work together. Imagine I am perfectly normal with everyone else, but when I put my reports on your desk, I slide them on gently, looking you in the eye, then I just hold them there, palm flat on the desk and I smile. I let the smile last just a second too long, then I go off and carry on being relatively normal with everyone else. I do that every single day, and each time you look less and less comfortable, and each time I either don't react or seem to enjoy your discomfort. How long would it take before that became very unpleasant for you? What kind of possible rule structure could be in place that could conceivable prevent me from doing this without requiring some communication from you? What would you ban? Looking someone in the eye and smiling for too long? How many seconds is too long? How would you time it?\nMoreover, how the fuck would this rule structure be able to distinguish intentional harassment from the situation where it turns out I am slightly autistic and I happen to really enjoy looking over your shoulder at your screensaver when I drop my reports on your desk?<p>We have to set the rules at a place of compromise and rely on explicit communication to sort everything else out.

If you're the sysadmin for a remote server that you suddenly discover you can't login to with your account and that people are complaining that it's sending spam, and you smash the stack on a vulnerable application running on the server in order to regain control and shut it down, I should hope that wouldn't be ""unauthorized access"" and subject to criminal penalties.<p>And then there's the fact that ""exploit"" is a fuzzy and undefined thing. Is changing ""userid=4833"" to ""userid=4834"" to get another user's account not an ""exploit"" but changing ""userid=4833"" to ""userid=0"" to get root access is? What if the maximum userid is 65535 and if you use ""userid=65536"" then it rolls back around and gives you root because it's equivalent to ""userid=0"" but doesn't get rejected like ""userid=0"" would? This is no way for a criminal law to operate.<p>>For the data Weev encountered was there any possible way to get a 401 response for the URLs?<p>Sure there was.

At the time iOS came out and dominated, typing on iOS seemed like the natural way to do it, so it's not a terrible implementation by any means.<p>But its autocorrect feature is absolutely abysmal. I tend to use the possessive ""its"" a lot. However, iOS will by default assume that I mean ""it's"" <i>no matter the context of the sentence</i>...which means that every time I want to use ""its"", I have to stop typing, look up at the text box, take my hands off the keyboard, and look for that stupid bubble and the tiny 'x' to prevent the autocorrection.<p>Android, by comparison, is practically <i>magic</i>. Perhaps it's because of the physical screen size that makes this possible, but how Android puts the autocorrect choices (three of them, not just one) right next to the keyboard is just pure logical genius. And I don't know what machine learning/natural language algorithm is used to guess the proper autocorrect choices but when typing at full blast, I have to <i>deliberately</i> make a typo for a typo to actually occur. iOS, by comparison, will inexplicably create nonsensical sentences with words I've never seen or used if I don't watch the textbox while typing. Maybe typing is old-fashioned and Apple wants to put more focus on swiping (Android's swipe keyboard is also pretty amazing, FWIW), but Jesus they've really let the keyboard go.<p>And of course, it's hard to imagine them ever catching up to Google in voice-input.",1363961330

And maybe we will be free to perform other activities that are much more relevant to our existence. But the brain is a well-oiled machine, and the less you use it the rusty it gets. If the glasses tell you exactly where to go all the time, we will lose spacial orientation perhaps. If the glass makes all the math for us, we will lose our computation abilities.<p>Furthermore, this will make you highly dependent on a device that could ran out of battery or connection. How will you perform computation that you need for decision making then? Let's take it further, why go to universities when Google Glass tells me what I need to know?",1363961104

There are actions that victims take that increase or decrease their chances of being victimized.<p>> it's no different then telling women not to wear provocative clothing if they don't want to be raped (And before people suggest it, I'm not equating rape to anything here).<p>What about if it is telling women to go out with their friends and look after each other when they are at bars?

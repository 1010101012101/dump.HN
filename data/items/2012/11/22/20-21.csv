I apologise.<p>I don't doubt the integrity, diligence and efforts the Rails project is putting into security as a whole.<p>Secure defaults are very important. Crypto is important, but not all security is crypto.<p>In this particular case, and I don't claim that it applies everywhere, this transparency has a potential cost.<p>I agree that it should be as transparent as possible, and also prefer convention over configuration. But some time the convention means some added risk, and particularly an <i>unknown</i> risk (because by following the convention I don't even have to <i>think</i> about this risk). In such a case, I think configuration might be preferable. Conversely, for any built-in security to be <i>transparent</i>, it really needs to be watertight and fit 100% of the users. Otherwise it puts some users at a risk they are completely <i>unaware</i> of.",1353617853

Other protocols for file-sharing are usually no better.<p>What if a technologically ignorant user can find, download, and play a work of video or music in just a few mouse clicks? I think this would have huge ramifications. Simply exposing file-sharing to a wider audience will increase political support and help counter the content industry's anti-filesharing propaganda.<p>I really like the analogy of 4 currencies when thinking about filesharing:\n<a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/LarsDoucet/20120222/91144/Piracy_and_the_four_currencies.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/LarsDoucet/20120222/91144/Pir...</a><p>Improving the user experience of file-sharing will not only reduce the first three costs to near zero, but after file-sharing becomes easy and accessible to everyone, it will become more normalized in society. In turn, this will gradually decrease the last cost, integrity, to zero.<p>The endgame is increased tolerance and political support of file-sharing, and disrupting the revenue of the content industry.<p>So how can we achieve this vision? I am thinking of a high quality package manager application similar to iTunes or Steam. The biggest usability improvement would be the concept of a repository, in that there is a curated database of files rather than whatever users want to upload, which is the standard right now for most forms of file-sharing.<p>As a consequence, there will be a canonical version of a title, removing the choice of picking between 10 different torrents and looking at seeders/trackers. Because there is now one destination when searching for a specific title, we can leverage existing and user-generated content to include things like graphics, videos, reviews, etc. on the landing page.<p>There are definitely huge technical challenges involved. For example, an application like this probably can't rely on a central server. So without a reliable server, how can we maintain a repository and support an easy one-click one-download feature? Moreover, we want to protect our users and implement some sort of private information retrieval.<p>This is an idea I've been thinking about for quite a while, and when I have time (not enough these days it seems), I have been tinkering around and trying to implement solutions to some of  the technical problems involved.",1353617036

What are they?<p>It seems like very obvious advice, but it is interesting to sit down and make a concentrated effort to think of what the shifts may be occurring in your industry. Sometimes they are easy to miss in that they are so obvious. (As in ""fish were the last ones to discover water..."").<p>Another way to think of it came to me from one of Tim O'Reilly's essays where he describes some key marketing advice he was given, which was to ""find a parade and get out in front of it."" (He attributes the success of O'Reilly media to getting behind the web and open source in its early days - <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20121002122119-16553-it-s-not-about-you-the-truth-about-social-media-marketing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20121002122119-16...</a>)  From that perspective, I like to think of what ""parades"" are happening in my industry, (energy), such as conservationism and environmental responsibility.  What happens if/when 75% of the cars on the road are electric vehicles, (and are driverless)?    Maybe my car is charged via solar panels or a whisper gen, and drives itself to the store where someone loads it with the groceries I ordered online? What products/services will be needed to support that?  What do things look like when homes are net-zero energy, as they are meant to be in California in 2020?<p>It can be an interesting exercise.<p>Edit: Typos",1353616855

Objects (commonly used as Maps) can have only String keys.<p>In contrast, desiring a way to `get` a nested String value is easily emulated in terms of current JavaScript semantics.

On top of that, it is possible to implement semantics for nested objects and ""computed properties"".<p>The Ember team has already been exploring how to incorporate Object.observe into Ember's observer system when it is more broadly available.

You can claim you don't know what the packet that you routed contained, because you can't know that. You can't be held liable for routing traffic per se, much like ISPs aren't liable for routing traffic per se.<p>Why Tor and I2P don't want to use one-hop connections is that someone with government-level access could deduce the participants by looking at the traffic timing patterns. But MAFIAA at least not yet isn't actively hooked to the major ISPs of the world and can't apply such a traffic analysis. A simple one-layer indirection would hide who's downloading and uploading what. All you see is routing nodes.<p>If you're MAFIAA and seeding your fake movies and music to this torrent network, you can only see a user's IP address uploading a block to your fake clients. But since everyone is acting on behalf of others and merely routing packets, you don't know who sent the packet and you can't possibly prove that the one who did the last route was guilty. Otherwise merely connecting to the network would mean the user is guilty. The network would of course transfer legitimate files as well, and while downloading a Ubuntu 13.04 image users would also handle these one-hop routing requests of other peers who are downloading/seeding other files.<p>Interestingly, you would only need to transfer a certain percentage of connections over the one-hop tunnel. You could use zero-hop for the rest. The MAFIAA can't recognize those so it still looks the same as if you acted as the router and fetched a block for another peer.<p>This could also be implemented as a global free-to-connect IPv6 VPN network. If the IP addresses uploading MAFIAA movies are virtual, nobody knows where they are and who operates them.",1353616483

Frameworks like Rails should expose the highest level cryptographic features possible and enable them by default. Secure-by-default is just another flavor of convention over configuration.<p>Rails doesn't exactly have the greatest track record when it comes to crypto or security but especially since Rails 3 they've done a great job addressing the problems, IMO.",1353614817
4819841,comment,4818611,4819801,5,0,evan_,,,"We're talking about Javascript the language, not individual implementations of javascript in browsers. Any browser could implement screengrab API today, they just haven't. Same for multithreaded javascript. Audio/video/canvas are all things that browsers have implemented, they are not innate features of Javascript.<p>Also despite what you say you CAN trigger an event (or whatever) inside a loop, it just won't do anything until you're out of the loop. This is because your browser implements javascript in a single thread. There are two easy solutions: Don't use a loop that's going to last for a long time, or use a Web Worker. This is, again, something that browsers have implemented, not a part of javascript. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_worker"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_worker</a>",1353614816

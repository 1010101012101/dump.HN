And, while entirely possible, it doesn't necessarily seem to be borne out by available evidence.<p><i>""Great writers don't expose their minds they shape the readers mind...""</i><p>This is a false dichotomy. ""Exposing"" one's mind, and influencing someone else's, are not mutually exclusive activities. Furthermore, shaping a reader's mind is not the sole province of the ""great"" writer. Terrible writers are often capable of influencing people. While I would agree that stronger writers are probably more capable of influence, influence itself is an after-effect of writing and an observational artifact. It is not intrinsic to the written product.<p>My point is that, since writing is necessarily an act of expression, the strength of one's expression reveals something about the strength of what one is trying to express. It's hard to cleanly separate the two.<p>Now, I'll readily concede that intelligence is probably not the most important variable in the quality of one's writing. Things like training, education, practice, exposure to other writing (via reading), etc., are far more important. But intelligence is in the equation.

In other words, only real people, who've physically been to a given restaurant, are able to review it. While you'd still suffer from selection-bias problems with this model, at least the self-selectors would be people with a propensity to try a lot of restaurants and review them -- not population-representative, perhaps, but at least dedicated to the task.<p>Of course, there are plenty of ways to game such a system. (You don't <i>actually</i> have to be at a restaurant to check into it, but you do need to be within a certain geographic radius -- so this would cut down on bogus or fraudulent reviews from people nowhere near the location). But those methods are harder to pull off, and they necessarily apply to a much smaller subset of potential gamers -- thereby making gaming a smaller-scale proposition.<p>Collaborative filtering would lend itself well to this model, too.

Or should I ask myself: ""Where is the money?""<p>The money, they do not have to pay Google anymore for the use of maps, while not crediting all these people, who supported OSM with their time and data-collecting.",1331215363

Target 200k of which 185k is used for the application for a gTLD and the remaining 15k is for setting up an INC or LLP such that all those who have contributed can register as many domains as they want for ""cost"" (whatever that works out to be).<p>Obviously the exact gTLD we chose is subject to a bit of democracy, voting etc etc but I'm sure with a bit of an open forum then they'll be an interesting debate.",1331215299

(After the launch I have no doubt there are some people vigorously complaining about this too.)<p>It would be really nice if they now link to some good quality electronic engineering page to explain what ""magnetics"" are, and how they work, and why they're used in network connectors.  Teaching people about computing is great.  Teaching people about electronic engineering would also be great.",1331215242

As a result, roundabout traffic typically moves slower, and they're MUCH safer.",1331215224

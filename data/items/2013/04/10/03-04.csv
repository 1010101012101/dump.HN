My guess is that tried to download something else and it as bundled, or clicked on an advert when using Google. That might explain a large part of success. Chrome is pretty good, but then so is Firefox and (even) IE10.<p><i>One thing that Google does better than anyone else (period) is build networks.</i><p>Even if I assume that as true (surely many will contest it) somehow I suspect that that's not why we don't have 100mbs or GB service countrywide",1365566316

For some people, and maybe kids are NOT this group (but the group exists), the initial syntax barrier for the complete novice is much more intimidating in Java than it is in Python (or Ruby).

I just called a friend(before writing this comment) and he confirms that he is not facing this issue on Idea+iPhone5(he faced the issue on Nexus S with Airtel and then Idea too).<p>I had asked a friend with a Lumia and on Airtel and he said he doesn't have to do this.<p>>><i>carrier sends usage alert when you ""turn off"" data + bad connection that keeps..</i><p>No, it sends whenever there's 3G transaction and the usage period ends. I've observed that when I am using browser, I usually get the alert after I close the browser.<p>Airtel technical team(I was told they were the tech team) also confirmed that it is based upon usage and usually many apps/features rely for background syncing/net-access solely upon 3G/data so that is what makes the number of pop-ups too much. They also confirmed that it happens even when the phone is continuously on WiFi(I concur).<p>>><i>There are a few apps that convert USSD</i><p>Tried.

I think it's more basic than that: he is totally overestimating the demand.<p>Yes, there are entry-level developer positions that pay $40,000, and more. However I think you'll find it difficult to locate many that require just six months of participation in a high school vocational training program. And you'll find even fewer in the economically depressed regions where this program may be most appealing.<p>Thanks to the current tech boom there <i>is</i> higher demand for more senior development positions, but those positions require a lot more experience and skill. Hard-to-find intangibles, not programming ability, often make these harder to fill.<p>It's funny that Ryan mentioned Facebook. As big a name as it is, the company only employs a few thousand people and from what I have seen, most of the developers there, even in the entry-level positions, have college degrees. At many of the big tech companies where you will be most likely to find six-figure salaries post-boom, college degrees, including those from particular institutions, are favored if not required.",1365563382

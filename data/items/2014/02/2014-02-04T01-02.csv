7175000,comment,7173702,7174919,1,0,redthrowaway,,,"Just as ID is a pseudoscientific attempt to cast doubt on evolution, motivated by ideology but dressed up as science, so too is denial of AGW an attempt to discredit climate science, motivated by ideology (or profit) and dressed up as science.<p>Climate models are tough and it&#x27;s very difficult for us to forecast what the results of global warming will be, especially at local scales.  That doesn&#x27;t change the fact, well supported by science and not seriously doubted by any meaningful number of climate scientists, that the Earth is getting warmer and it&#x27;s almost certainly due to our burning of fossil fuels.<p>There are two groups who try to make AGW seem less certain than it is: energy companies who have a financial interest in not seeing government action against carbon emissions, and libertarians who feel threatened by the reality of AGW as it would seem to mandate large-scale, international government regulations.  That would call into question deeply held libertarian beliefs about the ability of the free market to achieve societal goods and avoid evils.  Just as religious people (rightly) view evolution as a threat to their beliefs and respond by attacking evolution, so too do libertarians view AGW as a threat to theirs and respond in the same fashion.",1391479046

7174994,comment,7170142,7172771,3,0,gpcz,,,"There are two major competitors to the Von Neumann architecture, and then a few speculative ones.  The most popular one is Harvard architecture, where code and data are in separate memories (improves security and performance, but makes loading code difficult).  Most modern processors operate like a Harvard architecture machine when they are running directly from cache, but they act like Von Neumann machines when they have access to RAM.  This means that they get some of the performance benefits, but you need hacky things like W^X to get (partially) the security benefits.<p>The other one is dataflow architecture, which involves representing programs as a digraph where nodes represent instructions.  Data flows through edges from one instruction to the next non-deterministically.  This was popular research material in the late 70s and early 80s, but there were efficiency concerns.<p>IBM (and Von Neumann) also dabbled with making computers that resembled neural networks, but VN passed away before he could dedicate a lot of time to it.  AFAIK IBM&#x27;s neural computer is still in research phase.<p>I&#x27;d say Von Neumann machines &quot;won&quot; for a few reasons.  First, Von Neumann consulted for IBM in the department that developed their first commercially-sold computers, so he got a lot of creative control.  Second, as Hennessey and Patterson wrote in Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach, advocates of Von Neumann computers regarded HA machines as reactionary, implying there was even some religion back then.  Third, Von Neumann architecture machines are significantly easier to load programs into.  My guess is that a combination of business/political concerns on IBM&#x27;s part in the 50s and 60s combined with momentum and switching costs is the main reason VN machines continue to win.",1391478888

7174980,comment,7170663,7174606,2,0,Mikera,,,"IMHO Clojure&#x27;s omission of reader macros is sensible: it prevents proliferation of custom <i>syntax</i>, which makes it harder for a human to read code and reason about reader behaviour. The Clojure reader also already has its own literal syntax for vectors and maps [] and {} (which eliminates the most common use cases for reader macros).<p>If you believe that standards are helpful, then surely one standard reader behaviour is a good thing?<p>Regular macros are a different issue: they allow creation of custom control structures that aren&#x27;t possible with normal functions. That&#x27;s a powerful and useful feature, as many Lisps have proved over the years.<p>So Clojure rejects the former (unnecessary syntax sugar, potential for confusion, dubious value of reader proliferation) and accepts the latter (additional semantic power, proven utility). I personally think that&#x27;s a good trade-off. YMMV of course.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s nothing stopping you from implementing a custom reader in Clojure if you really want reader macros. So far, nobody (to my knowledge) seems to have cared enough to do this.<p>NOTE: I&#x27;m <i>not</i> bashing Common Lisp: just pointing out that language design has real trade-offs. For me, Clojure gets the majority of these design decisions right. For others, maybe reader macros are an essential feature and Clojure therefore doesn&#x27;t work.

A simulation also found that 1.8 degree Fahrenheit in projected mean temperature was found to decrease wheat yields by 10.64 bushels per acre or nearly 21%.<p>Yes, humans will adapt.

7174972,comment,7172971,7174542,1,0,saurik,,,"The argument for lexers has nothing to do with machine instructions: it has to do with algorithmic performance. Grammars tend to have time complexity that is greater than linear with a moderate constant (and a parser combinator library, which is really just a lightweight programming abstraction making it easier to develop by-hand recursive descent parsers, normally doesn&#x27;t try to help with this problem), whereas a good lexer tends to have linear time complexity with a nearly zero constant. If you can separate your compilation phase into &quot;first run a lexer, then run a grammar&quot;, you can parse much longer files (not just constantly longer, but asymptotically longer) in the same amount of time. There is no fundamental reason to separate these phases, however, and it has minimal effect on the resulting compiler: numerous compilers, even numerous compiler generators, have these phases combined into a single grammar step, with the tokens now being effectively characters. (There are also engines that try to slide between the two levels, using an algorithm more similar to a lexer at the base of your grammar, but still letting you define these psuedo-tokens in the unified grammar as rules.)",1391478491

Under the Seventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which governs civil (non-criminal) cases, a jury&#x27;s findings of fact cannot be overturned unless the judge (or an appellate court) finds that <i>no</i> reasonable jury could have made those findings on the basis of the evidence of record.<p>I imagine there are more than a few plaintiffs&#x27; lawyers with suitable expertise who would be thrilled to take 53&#x27;s case on a contingent-fee basis -- not least because they&#x27;d get a lot of publicity for doing so.<p>One not-unlikely outcome:  53 changes its product name, and Facebook pays 53 a significant amount of money, perhaps as an investment.",1391478241

But numerous narratives make clear that slaves were often not fed and clothed sufficiently, not to mention that their health and hygiene was neglected. The idea that they were provided for adequately is a foolish and unwarranted assumption. They were treated, often times, worse than animals.<p>Not to mention the routine sexual assaults that women and men endured--that&#x27;s in some of the narratives as well. And not merely an assault only from the slave owner, but from his siblings, sons, overseers who worked for him, and the like. A particularly noteworthy account observed that slave owners would interrupt the meals of enslaved families and require the daughters or wives to leave with them to be sexually assaulted and then return the women after they were finished. These would be severe horrors to anyone who had to endure them and can&#x27;t be ignored because someone doesn&#x27;t like to hear about them--or thinks something else is more interesting.<p>These enslaved people were human beings. There is no reason to minimize the suffering portion of the narrative, especially since they lived with those horrors daily and accounted for a significant part of their experiences while enslaved. Again, if you&#x27;ve read some of these narratives, you would know that there are lengthy discussions of their lives after becoming free--everything isn&#x27;t about their suffering.<p>There are certainly other perspectives from which we can look at American slavery. The corrupting influence was (and remains) staggering.<p>Of course people like stories that challenge the narrative of the sufferings of African enslaved people. It is more pleasant not to discuss or even acknowledge the horrors that existed, for a variety of reasons.

Darcs was the first VCS I used and it was very well designed from a command line point of view. It&#x27;s so simple and easy and it just made sense. The interface for adding hunks was just great and like nothing else that came before it.<p>But—we (my partner on a project) recently just switched one of our earliest projects from Darcs to Git. It started in 2005 and we&#x27;ve been very happy with Darcs. But we&#x27;d been using Git a lot in the past few years and Darcs started seeming a little simplistic. We were <i>really</i> hesitant because it had been working so well for the past years and why change something that isn&#x27;t obviously broken?<p>We decided to just do the Git switch and it because clear after just a couple days of working with Git that it was a <i>much</i> better experience overall. Having easy easy feature branches and &quot;git stash&quot; and &quot;git rebase&quot; made our lives so much better and our moods so much happier that we cursed ourselves for not switching years ago.<p>Git even copied the Darcs hunk interface with their &quot;add -p&quot; and &quot;checkout -p&quot; options, which I use constantly.<p>Since I became proficient at Git, <i>nothing</i> else looks good any more (even the VCSes I used to love).",1391477132

What you are saying is you can only program in way X if your language forces you to, which is obviously wrong?<p>If you have a library that expects mutable data structures, that&#x27;s going to be incompatible with a library that uses immutable data structures. The type signatures of the functions are going to be fundamentally different.<p>It&#x27;s certainly possible to have a language without a consistent set of core data structures, but I&#x27;d argue that&#x27;s considerably less useful. Enforcing a particular paradigm means you can interface between libraries without worrying about compatibility of data structures.<p>> Then they made that up. ClojureScript is not the same as Clojure. They did a pretty horrible job at seperating their language from their platform.<p>That&#x27;s not quite what I meant. A particular implementation of Clojure is typically tied closely to the platform its hosted on. That&#x27;s why Clojure and ClojureScript have marked differences, especially around concurrency.<p>What Clojure lacks, and deliberately so, is a platform of its own. There isn&#x27;t an equivalent of the JVM in Clojure; there&#x27;s no intermediate layer that sits between Clojure and the JVM, or ClojureScript and Javascript. The idea is that the language should adapt to its host, instead of trying to shoehorn everything through a universal interface that can&#x27;t cope with every situation.",1391476409

The author is simplifying things greatly but he&#x27;s essentially correct - the naive version with less operations ends up slower because there is a long chain of dependencies.<p>With out-of-order execution this isn&#x27;t really a <i>stall</i>, because non-dependent instructions can still execute/retire with renamed registers alongside it, but it still effectively delays progress of the dependent chain the same way an in-order pipeline would operate. You might say: its progress is stalled.",1391475764

7174760,comment,7173702,7173978,1,0,brc,,,"What you are saying is that the observed climate sensitivity to co2 has been much lower than the modeled climate sensitivity to co2. And that the earlier, alarming models showing large temperature rises are most likely to be incorrect for a variety of reasons.<p>And on that basis the case for punitive taxation no longer makes sense, and attention should be focused on the development of alternative, efficient and productive energy sources.  This should be regarded as a technology challenge, rather than a public policy crisis whereby the blunt instruments of taxation and regulation should force the use of inefficient and costly energy sources.<p>And you&#x27;d be correct.  You shouldn&#x27;t be so shy about stating your position.  I understand that stating a realist position has become unfashionable, but in the spirit of the PG essay &#x27;What you can&#x27;t say&#x27; [1] - I always make a point of saying the unfashionable thing.  And that is that early models or climate sensitivity were wrong, and the public policy positions generated from those are counter-productive and ineffective.<p>[1] <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/say.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/say.html</a>",1391475722

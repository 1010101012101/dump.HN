I don't think that changes much but just thought I would put it out there in case it does change anything.  Thus far I have been very selective about the startups I have chosen to interview with.

214468,comment,214398,214398,0,0,rewind,,,"I think if you give someone the option to downvote, there are always going to be people who do whatever they want with it. Telling someone not to downvote if they disgree with a well-presented argument is like telling someone not to post crap in the first place (or not to upvote crap, for that matter). Most will abide by the guidelines, but there's nothing you can do to stop the minority from misusing abusing it. Unfortunately, the wrong minority is enough to ruin the feature (or even the community, although I don't think that has happened here).",1213143935

But here's a suggestion for handling it.  Can't tell if it's pie-in-the-sky, so input's encouraged...<p>Most of us make it a habit to abide by the news.YC ""guidelines,"" such as not changing the text of submitted headlines unless it's needed for clarification, and not adding comment signatures.  And it's an easy thing to police because there's accountability.  Case in point, I've only seen a signature once, and another user had pointed to the users' misstep by the time I noticed it.<p>But there's no accountability for downmodding.  There really can't be, else you injure the chance for honest opinions from people afraid of the kickback.  But what if there was a single line of text you needed to include with a downmod?  Something short, like 25-40 characters, that explained your reason.  The community would recognize anonymous feedback like ""Trolling"" and ""Unnecessary personal attack"" as reasonable motives for downmodding, and ""Bad point"" or ""Stupid idea"" as unreasonable.<p>It wouldn't eliminate the problem -- I don't think anything anonymous could -- but it might create some mechanism for policing indiscriminate downmods and encouraging fair use.<p>Of course where you'd display that information is another issue entirely...",1213143709

Even if that violated expectation counted for nothing, I'd estimate that 30% of the dental site's users wouldn't think to use the browser's find button.  I would fire this man in an instant.<p>Even if we didn't have to contend with the habits and training that users have, I doubt this would be better.  Is he arguing that a navbar with links to the appropriate sections is not worth the space it takes? If not, is he arguing that the benefits of everything being on one page (more useful browser find, I guess) outweighs the downsides (seo, users wading through mountains of text, scrolling required to access navbar, etc)?<p>On the other hand, check out songza.com for some smart one-page web antics.",1213143162

Perl 6 maintainers are not the same people as Perl 5 Porters -- both will be maintained for the foreseeable future.<p>Second, Perl 6 is a significant change to Perl, with far more features and somewhat different syntax.  People will want to change for the features.  Running Perl 5 code from inside Perl 6 works by calling out to libperl, which runs a real version of Perl 5.  Perl 5 will still be popular due to ubiquity, access to CPAN modules, and things like CPAN Testers.<p>So it&#x27;s a choice for the developer, to develop in a new language that just happens to be Perl-flavored, or to go with any other language.

As we stood in line, 10 or so people back, my eyes stayed on them. I’ve always gone out of my way to avoid generalizations. I imagined that perhaps these two cops were good people, but I couldn’t stop thinking about what the Santa Monica police had done to me.

We decided against just using crypto_secretbox from NaCl because it doesn&#x27;t have a way for us to simply pause and resume to keep from blocking our UI thread on big files. We thought about trying to bolt ways into seeking into the stream output of crypto_stream, but that wasn&#x27;t performing well. We went as far as trying to use crypto_secretbox in an Asm.js-ified WebWorker, but the performance hit was just too big, so we knew we had to find a way to &quot;schedule&quot; our encryption, otherwise our React.js app would crawl. The reason I passed on AES is far less justifiable, but important to me for aesthetic reasons: Using Skein just seemed like way more fun.

Yes, keeping people safe is clearly in the national interest, but many other things are too, hence the fact that GCHQ has spied on climate change talks, trade deals, attempted to influence online discussions, the NSA has hacked oil companies, etc. They are in no way limited to a mission of &#x27;keeping people safe&#x27;.<p>This is one reason I tend to think intelligence agencies should be disbanded and their best people merged into police forces. The police have a clear and (relatively) focused mission: fight crime. Most of those criminal investigations are about keeping people safe in one form or another.

You&#x27;ll need to convert both strings to the same case, and then compare those. In the majority of cases, you can do:<p>return string_a.lower() == string_b.lower()<p>But sometimes that won&#x27;t work, because converting case isn&#x27;t always easy. And that&#x27;s a unicode issue, not a python issue. It&#x27;s not even completely a unicode issue, just a &quot;writing can be very weird&quot; issue.<p>For example, &quot;ß&quot; (U+00DF) is a character that doesn&#x27;t/shouldn&#x27;t have an uppercase form. Unicode does support it as U+1E9E, but all the examples I know of will convert it to &quot;SS&quot; ([U+0053, U+0053]) instead.<p>Try this in a javascript console, for example.<p><pre><code>  > &quot;ß&quot;.toUpperCase().toLowerCase() === &quot;ß&quot;.toLowerCase()\n  false\n  > &quot;ß&quot;.toUpperCase() === &quot;SS&quot;.toUpperCase()\n  true\n  > &quot;ß&quot;.toLowerCase() === &quot;SS&quot;.toLowerCase()\n  false\n  > &quot;ß&quot;.length\n  1\n  > &quot;ß&quot;.toLowerCase().length\n  1\n  > &quot;ß&quot;.toUpperCase().length\n  2\n  > &quot;ß&quot;.toUpperCase().toLowerCase()\n  &quot;ss&quot;\n</code></pre>\nAlso, try ctrl+f&#x27;ing for &quot;ss&quot; on the Wiki page for ß [0] and see what it matches.

10591148,comment,10589398,10590251,0,0,dxbydt,,,"I interview a lot of developers for ML positions at our company. The first red flag is always a lack of math. Candidates who come in with API-level competence ie. can implement an ML algo using this,that or the other API, without any understanding of some basic math behind it, always fare poorly. Atleast in ML, not having an understanding of math is pretty much like claiming expertise in riding a bicycle by watching 100s of bicycle videos on youtube without ever riding a bicycle yourself. This isn&#x27;t the case with say, front-end web dev, where nobody really cares whether what&#x27;s under the hood is php or jquery or elegantly handcrafted elm as long as the webpage looks good and functions as advertised. You can get a lot of mileage by hiring someone who can &quot;make webpages&quot; without knowing what tools they use to make that webpage. Once you get traction etc. you&#x27;ll probably rewrite all of the cruft :) With ML, if you hire somebody who can &quot;create decision tree in python mllib&quot; without knowing the first thing about what entropy is & how to compute entropy ( a real candidate, unfortunately ), you are simply inflicting a lot of pain on yourself and your customers. Suppose such a person is deciding whether or not to give you a loan, and he decides to construct a decision tree. He&#x27;ll happily throw in your zip code and credit card number into the mix, not realizing that those two features have super high entropy but the tree will have serious overfitting issues ie. the tree will simply not generalize to unseen data. He won&#x27;t realize these things because he won&#x27;t know what entropy is in the first place, since he only thinks of decision trees in terms of some black box that comes out of some ML api.",1447884667

I&#x27;d never comment on an ex-employee beyond confirming that he worked on the given dates.<p>> This is cheaper than having directors and executives try to plan around all sorts of interview stages.<p>From my experience, in the first 3-6 month you invest a whole lot in the new employee. He or she is very far from 100% productive and you also need to assign someone for mentoring which also takes company resources. Bad hires are really expensive.<p>In my previous company I was involved a lot in hiring. After CV screening we normally did a 1-2 hour interview (both technical and non-technical) which was (in a positive case) follow by an offer to spend one day working with us. Finally, a permanent contract with 6 month probation time (standard practice in Germany). We had very high success rate. No bad hires on my memory, low fluctuation, very high employee loyality. The company has stellar employee feedback on kununu.com.<p>The downside was that many applicants were really discouraged by our hiring process. Some people were outraged by the fact that they had to actually write code on the interview. Some thought we the purpose of the probation day was to make the work for free. But that&#x27;s OK, we&#x27;ve found a lot of great people anyway.<p>Now I&#x27;m working for a huge corporation. I&#x27;m normally not involved in interviews for permanent positions but I&#x27;m always interviewing when staffing external developers my projects. (We staff developers mainly externally.)

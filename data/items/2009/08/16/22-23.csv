In exurban and rural areas, there's not really going to be a lot of news within the (geographic) area people care about.  It's too fragmented.<p>For instance, the fight between the mayor two-towns-over and the county government isn't really of interest to the rest of the county most of the time.  I don't care about a murder that happened 30 miles away.  News generation is probably a function of population density - in less dense areas, there's not a lot going on that needs to be reported on, so to fill even 4-6 newspaper pages, you've got to cover hundreds of square miles, and so each article isn't ""local"" for a large percentage of the population.",1250460089

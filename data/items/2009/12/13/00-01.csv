How are those and neuron growth different, and how does the synapse learning fit into the paint model? Or am I misunderstanding how synapses work?<p>Exactly.<p>The thing that is growing by pruning is the <i>ability</i> to learn. NOT the learning itself.<p>A babies brain is disorganized, and doesn't have thought like an adult brain. Over time it learns how to learn, it learns about cause and effect. It learns there is an external world, and that it can effect that world.<p>It learns that it can reason about that world - if I do this, this happens - and I thought of it.<p>It's like having raw hardware, without software. A baby creates the software on the fly.<p>Later in life it fills the memory of the program with information, but the program itself is learned early.<p>And by program, a better term might be firmware, since a person can learn new way to think later in life. It's the machinery of thinking itself that a baby creates.<p>That's why the environment during infancy and childhood has such a massive effect later in life. It's why babies in almost any situation will adapt and mange.",1260665213

One of the problems of using regression on time series is the model is much better at modeling a grand mean than getting the variation right.  So if you take an recent upward trend of something you are measuring and then use regression to get data for past points you don't know- you are likely to predict a fairly flat past, almost no matter what the nature of the original data.  You need to (at the very least) cross validate by holding out a large contiguous interval of the past where you know the temperature and the proxies to see if the model tracks.",1260664011

992161,comment,990523,991866,0,0,k0n2ad,,,"No doubt, there are plenty of cases when medication is the right option. However, there are many more cases where it's not.<p>How we do psychology? We take a bunch of symptoms that seem to coincide with a group of individuals and we label it as a disorder : <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhd#DSM-IV_criteria"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhd#DSM-IV_criteria</a><p>The fact that these symptoms exist and cause problems for many individuals is of no question - that's why we have a ""disorder"" label associated with it. There is no dispute that medication is effective in treating these symptoms, either.<p>However, the claim that medication ""even more effective"" is flimsy, if not flat out wrong. The problem is that there are many more studies devoted to the ""effects of ritalin on ADHD"" than there are to the ""effects of exercise and ADHD."" Or meditation, or biofeedback, or eating 7 lbs of celery a day, or whatever. To make the claim that ""drugs are more effective"" is easier because studies of this nature are more prevalent - but it doesn't make it right. That would be a total confirmation bias.<p>A difficulty in comparing medication to other methods is that medication = instant gratification and instant results. You eat a pill. A half hour later, you are focused, less scattered and more attentive. In the similar way to how coffee wakes you up if you are tired. It's easy to make an experiment out of such results. Exercise, in contrast, isn't instant. Exercise increases levels of nor-epinephrine and dopamine... but not nearly as rapidly (or with as little work) as an amphetamine compound. Steady and healthy levels of serotonin (which is now being studied as another player in the ADHD game) don't begin to rise until weeks of daily exercising. It may be slower, but our bodies are capable of changing, and for quantities of any given chemical being pumped out to increase, you need to keep doing things that keep causing it to be released. You need to form habits that make your body more effective at producing it's own chemical cocktails. Take a basic course in human physiology or neuroscience if you don't believe how amazing and capable our bodies and brains are at adapting and improving.<p>Furthermore, a disorder label can easily be misconstrued by a young individual with ADHD. They might think to themselves, ""Wow, finally, a word to describe all the problems I'm having. It's not my fault after all, I'm sick, and I need medicine."" It sucks because instead of really trying to go beyond the condition by using their will, they may give up and go the route of altering their minds externally - just to keep up with their peers. Is that a bad thing? Well, I'll leave that up to the reader.<p>It is my personal opinion that that overcoming challenges of ADHD is not only possible through other, healthier methods (exercise, meditation and learning/coping strategies), but is more rewarding as well (speaking from personal experience).<p>However, no one can do this by themselves - and it sucks that some people do not have the support, and that schools don't have a 15 minute exercise break every 3 hours, and that they don't let you eat snacks in class, and that we are constantly exposed to electronic stimulation from a very young age, that some of us don't learn how to control our intake of these things. Television, video games and other forms of electronic stimulation have been proven to release dopamine (Jeez, what doesn't?). A person with ADHD can easily focus to a show on TV with quickly changing camera angles, loud sounds, constant dialogue and continuous novelty. We grew up with this. But, when we are in class, we fidget, and daydream and blurt things out because this stimulation is not present, so our bodies are attempting to mitigate the dopamine withdrawal through the constant production of activity, of both the mind and the body.<p>Finally, Ritalin hasn't been studied for 70 years. It's been about 40. It didn't start being used for ADHD until The late 60s, and wasn't in widespread use until the 90s - which is when the more serious studies began to come out.<p>There's much more to say, but I'm getting tired :)<p>Sources:\n<a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-03-26-adhd-treatment_x.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-03-26-adhd-treatmen...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/12/041220013546.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/12/041220013546.ht...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/565830"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/565830</a>",1260663565

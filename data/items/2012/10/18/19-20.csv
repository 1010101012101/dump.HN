The earliest it would possibly break would be in the next major OS upgrade.</i><p>That's not true at all. Twitter could revoke their API access or something that could break it tomorrow. Yes the actual app may still be on my device but nothing says it will actually still be able to work. That is all in Twitter's hands.<p>> <i>The idea that a measly $20 is too much to pay for months of engineering and design work up to now, let alone going forward, is utterly absurd.</i><p>That is their decision to make this bet. If I were to spend years and years making the perfect toaster and I charge $1,000 for it (to pay for the engineering and design work), you're saying it's <i>absurd</i> NOT to buy it? It's actually the opposite. It's absurd to assume that just because someone puts engineering and design into a product, that it automatically makes the product worth <i>X</i> price.",1350590350

I am surprised to bump into this view again.<p>A CSS layout is better than a table-based layout, due to:<p>- Maintenance: Maintaining or redesigning a table-based layout is very cumbersome, especially with nested tables, because:<p>- Seperation of content and design: The content has to be changed, to change the design, and that is not a nice workflow.<p>- Accessibility: CSS designs allow much better for a user-specified stylesheet. Resize the browserwindow and tables keep sticking out, where with CSS you can change the order (put columns under each other). Screenreaders behave in a specific way for tables, they try to read the ""summary"", or they assume the table holds tabular data, reading it row by row. A table lay-out can therefor confuse.<p>- SEO: CSS designs make content stacking possible, tables only allow to put the content in the order of the table cells. Webmaster guidelines ask you to check for correct use of HTML, which tables for lay-out isn't:<p>- Semantics/standards: Use tables for tabular data. Provide a summary and table header if relevant and possible. Using tables for lay-out semantically turns your entire page into tabular data.<p>- Pagespeed: CSS allows for faster, progressive rendering. HTML tables take their width from the resulting table-cell: Content will jump around while rendering or some browsers even show a blank table before all content is loaded.<p>A CSS framework like this is far from hacky. Using tables for layout, because CSS is deemed too complex, now that is hacky.<p>Also, don't forget support for ""display: table"" is in near all modern browsers. If you really want to design lay-out like you are using tables, it is possible with CSS too.<p>For responsive designs, much more is possible with CSS than a 100% width table.

If you view a webpage as vaguely structured data, then using a table for layout is akin to using a String to represent an enumerated value. Sure, you can do it and it will work, but you're diminishing our ability to reason about your data and access it with our tools.<p>If I'm working in a codebase and wanted to see where we're presenting tabular data to the user and we're using tables for layout, I now cannot know which kind of table I'm looking at: presentational or structured.<p>If a user is using a screenreader to access a site, the screenreader will see the table and read it line-by-line. In a presentational case, that means <tr> by <tr>. This is meaningless to a non-sighted person and lowers the usability of the site.<p>Tables don't respond to CSS as well as other block elements. Try setting the width or height of an individual cell in relation to the container. You'll likely end up using spanning columns or spanning rows or setting the width using table attributes.

Maybe ""destitute"" could serve this purpose?<p>In any case, if you're poor, your time is cheap. This doesn't jibe with the claim that the poor lack enough time to, say, cook healthy meals for themselves. Poor people 100 years ago were poorer than most poor people today, and yet they largely cooked for themselvesand they were much thinner.<p>What accounts for this change? My suspicion is that it's <i>dependence</i> without <i>responsibility</i>. A hundred years ago, private charities (which are accountable to their donors) were in a position to hold recipients of their largesse responsible for their actions. But such charities have now largely been displaced by government agencies. These agencies have been captured by special interest groups, and charity has mutated into entitlements. As a result of receiving benefits without accountability, the poor have lost much of the knowledge needed to be self-sufficient, which motivates further intervention. It's the law of unintended consequences followed by iatrogenic escalation.<p>These interest groups are not the poor themselves, but rather those who speak for the poor. I think it's no coincidence that the former tend to vote for the latter. Political patronage is one of the oldest plays in the book.<p>I'd guess you'll find the above narrative unconvincing, but I like how you think, so I thought it was worth a shot.",1350589052

The value for Apple is that a team that works together well is more than the sum of the parts, but only if they keep the people who would fit well within Apple.<p>The people who stay usually receive a retention package which could be a mix of restricted stock units and cash, vests over  three or four years, and is determined by:<p>- the experience and seniority of each person.<p>- the perceived value of each person to Apple.<p>Apple tries to gauge what it would take for the core of the team to stay long enough. Someone may need 500k over four years in addition to salary, someone else may need 2M. It's impossible to say what is being offered to each developer unless you're an insider.<p>For that reason nobody can know what the deal really costs to Apple, but it's definitely more than what investors get.

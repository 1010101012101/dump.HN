Humans decreased biodiversity.<p>But if rewilding is meant in the pre-Columbian sense, then the hypothetical would be to compare the ecology in the year 1400 had humans in the Americans died out in, say, the year 900.<p>We simply don&#x27;t know the answer to that, that I know of in my limited understanding.<p>We do know that human fire practices change the landscape. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Yellowstone_Ecosystem#Ecosystem_management_by_species"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Yellowstone_Ecosystem#...</a> mentions the decline of quaking aspen, and how one of the factors may be fire-return intervals. Humans have long used fire to clear out underbrush, but I really know so little of archaeology or related fields.<p>So in that case? Humans may have help prevent biodiversity reduction.<p>I can point towards Australia as an example of a longer-term ecosystem adaptation for human fire practices. The general belief is that &quot;Burn-offs or small, cool fires were thought to be used by Aboriginal people both for hunting and for the prevention of larger fires&quot; and &quot;most Australian plants wouldn&#x27;t be distributed around the country the way that they are now if people hadn&#x27;t burned-off the land through history.&quot; - <a href=""http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2010/12/aboriginal-burn-off-theory-hosed-down/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2010/12/aborigin...</a><p>That&#x27;s not saying there was more or less biodiversity, only that there are different ecosystem patterns with and without human. But I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s possible to compare biodiversity when there&#x27;s been 10,000+ or 50,000+ years of ecosystem adaption.<p>Is there less biodiversity in North and South America because of the Great American Interchange? Should pre-Panamanian land bridge be our goal once we&#x27;ve restored the Pleistocene era ecology? There had to be a goal besides &quot;improved biodiversity.&quot; My goal, btw, is to point out that humans are part of the ecology.",1446231582

Because the benchmarks game generally prohibits calling out to C, it means that many &quot;tricks&quot; employed by low-level languages are unavailable to the higher-level languages. Whether or not this is a desirable property is up to the reader&#x27;s interpretation.<p><pre><code>  > Seems like &quot;cheat&quot; needs to be in scare quotes.\n</code></pre>\nIndeed, because it&#x27;s essentially impossible to enforce anything like &quot;idiomatic&quot; code in any of the benchmarks game languages, and so whether a program is &quot;cheating&quot; is up to the reader&#x27;s interpretation. That said, the fact that it is up to the reader&#x27;s interpretation means that it is valid for some readers to conclude that some programs are &quot;cheating&quot;, while other programmers may differ.

Leaving that out of consideration is...not smart...highly biased...as in, how many readers of The Economist would consider sending their kid to become a diesel mechanic?<p>From the research I&#x27;ve absorbed over the years, students that can afford to go to prestige universities often come from well-to-do, college educated families - these are high indicators of future success. For a much larger swath of the population that is trying to advance their stake in life, they are first-generation students, and often not well-served by taking on debt and attending a large University environment. Thus, many Universities are, practically speaking, very bad at ROI for a large contingent of students who simply want to make more money - vocational training? An excellent prospect.<p>What remains to be seen is how much more earning potential there is in professions that require vocational training to be licensed or successful (i.e. welding, machining, air traffic control, plumbing, electrical contracting) as the generation currently working retires / dies from the workforce, thereby spiking demand, and in fields where a &quot;traditional&quot; University degree are, well, useless.",1446230845

Even by their own intent (i.e., best added value based on salary), their methodology is nonsensical.<p>For example: Why should CalTech get hurt for being near L.A.? They&#x27;re basically arguing that you&#x27;re better off going to a school in the middle of nowhere because &quot;hey, for being in such a crappy location, you did pretty well!&quot;. In an <i>absolute</i> sense you are better off going to CalTech, it&#x27;s just that they might not leverage their advantage as well as some other schools.<p>Not that they even show the last point -- it seems unlikely that the true model is linear (I&#x27;m guessing they used linear regression). For example, if the true model is closer to a sigmoid, then schools at the high end suddenly get unfairly penalized and schools near the low end get unfairly boosted.<p>Finally, the statistical indicators are equally misleading. I can obtain an R^2 of 1.0 just by including indicators I[is COLLEGE_NAME] for each college. While that might not give you significance, the point is that getting good prediction is meaningless.<p>I think what they really want is to restrict to predictors about the students. So, given that you&#x27;re a straight A student with a 2400 SAT score, what would you expect to make coming out of each school? This at least tells me something about the added value to <i>me</i> of going to a certain school. (This approach is still prone to bias, but in the opposite direction -- there&#x27;s a chance that the straight A student with a 2400 SAT score going to community college may have been smart but unmotivated, which might correlate with lower salary.)<p>Edit: Here&#x27;s another concern. They&#x27;re claiming to have a model for &quot;expected&quot; earnings:<p>earnings = A * (college covariates) + b + error<p>but they can&#x27;t distinguish between <i>model error</i> (i.e., error because their model is misspecified) vs. the school variation that they are trying to capture.",1446230752

In your first 30 minute session, it&#x27;s likely you&#x27;ll only spend a maximum of a minute or two on your feet practicing.<p>This makes the ratio very low, so you have to spend tons of elapsed time to learn.<p>The same applies to wake boarding (wait for the boat to come get you), kite surfing (untangle the kite) and a few others.",1446229945

In practice, things are never so simple.<p>When you use Big-Oh notation, O(f(n)), you claim that there exist one function F(n) that accurately characterizes the running time of an algorithm based on the size of the input, and that f(n) is the higher order component of that function. I looks something like this:<p><pre><code>   F(n) = A*f(n) + B*g(n) + C*h(n) + ... + K  \n      where A,B,C,..K are constants and f,g,h,... are functions.\n</code></pre>\nYou approximate F(n) ~= Af(n) because for n big enough, this component will dominate the <i>growth</i> of such function. But A is different for different algorithms... so, in the case of sorting, you have several options - quicksort, mergesort, heapsort - that are in paper all &quot;the same&quot; but each has a different constant, and there are real advantages of using the one with the smallest constant.<p>Furthermore, if you are not trying to sort infinitely big data (most real world cases) you must consider that other components of the actual F(n) function, such as g and h, may dominate the performance of the algorithm in the range of data sizes that you are more likely to encounter. There are other measures of algorithmic complexity that deal with this (I recall there is one Small-Oh notation, among others), but they don&#x27;t teach you that at school unless you are a posgraduate student doing highly relevant work in complexity theory. I suspect most guys, like myself, find out by not taking Knuth as holy gospel and reading further material.<p>And then there are the degenerate cases, where your data can get sorted in quasi-linear time if you apply one of the slow dumb O(n^2) dinosaurs.",1446229527

See Caltech for an example of a STEM-focused school that does badly by this measure: from its SAT scores, demographics, and heavy concentration of STEM majors, the regression analysis predicts that it should produce graduates with a median salary of $82k. But the actual median is $74k, so its value-add is taken to be -$8k.<p>Some of the schools that do well are in areas with poor salaries, but score highly because they do better than you&#x27;d expect (or than the model would expect, anyway) for that area and student demographics.

Yes, it is far more limited in many ways as you can&#x27;t build a system a hospital can integrate but there is still a lot that can be done.<p>20-30 years ago, if you had a problem, you went to a doctor and that was about it. Now, people are more likely to choose to (or forced to by cost) seek alternative practitioners or at least partially take matters into their own hands (independent research, dietary and lifestyle changes, etc). These will usually be people who are not really getting helped by the system and are probably facing issues where lifestyle is a big factor (autoimmune issues, diabetes, obesity, etc). If you can successfully help that group of people where the system has failed to, then you may start to see some real changes as most people ultimately will (eventually) gravitate to what actually works (yes, I am an optimist).<p>Of course, as another commenter mentioned, we tend to be terrible at doing things now to benefit our future selves, but I still believe technology could play a big role in helping with that and the current options, like wearing a fitbit, are barely scratching the surface, mainly in that they aren&#x27;t yet doing much to prove their benefit to the consumer or obviously help them day-to-day.

The problem comes down to the usual case of entrenched vendors working to protect and expand their turf. EHR vendors are notorious for being terrible for interop—some are better than others, but they all see integrations as competing with their own offerings. Non-trendy methods of exposing data—SOAP, custom MUMPS code, direct SQL access—are the norm. That&#x27;s not a problem, except that documentation is often incorrect or nonexistent (while being restricted to direct customers, of course), and the vendors really don&#x27;t care about APIs. They see interop as a necessary bullet point on a sales sheet, but they&#x27;d rather not have those APIs be used in place of their (usually crappy) complementary apps that they&#x27;re trying to upsell.<p>Interop is a HUGE win for patients. Without it, we lose one of the main advantages of EHRs—the ability to access our own information when we need it, and allowing the information to be fluidly shared between providers.

However, it is not illegal for providers to negotiate standard rates for specific payers. Combine this with the fact that providers lose money on their publicly-insured patients[1], and it becomes clear that they have to overcharge the rest in order to end up in the black.<p>So what they do is set absurdly high sticker prices, knowing that the private insurers will negotiate those down (usually this is done in multiples of what Medicare pays - e.g., Aetna will say, &#x27;We&#x27;ll pay you 150% of the Medicare price for billing code 99481 this year&#x27;.<p>Uninsured patients are stuck with huge bills as a result, though this is basically an unintentional side-effect of the fact that hospitals <i>can&#x27;t</i> give them lower bills initially. It&#x27;s also the reason that hospitals are almost always willing to negotiate  with uninsured patients. If they know to ask, they can almost <i>always</i> get that down to 10% of the original rate. That bill isn&#x27;t meant for individuals, they don&#x27;t really expect individuals to pay, and they&#x27;d much rather negotiate a discount and have it paid in full immediately than have a patient default, which has negative repercussions for their bad debt ratio.<p>Privately insured patients end up having higher premiums as a result, because their insurers are paying higher rates to subsidize other patients who are not paying any premiums at all (publicly insured patients)[2].<p>[0] There&#x27;s a little nuance to this, but that&#x27;s the general idea.<p>[1] Medicare reimburses less than the actual costs of services provided per-patient, before accounting for any overhead<p>[2] This subsidy happens at the claims level, so it counts towards the insurer&#x27;s requisite MLR.",1446228058

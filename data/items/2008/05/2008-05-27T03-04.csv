200664,comment,200420,200420,0,0,rplevy,,,"I could be wrong about this, but I think the mesh capabilities depend on some of the intricacies of Sugar/Bitfrost and you lose that when running Ubuntu.  Admittedly meshing is not a practical need (I mostly use it for reading books, but also some mobile programming and web browsing) but it's neat to be able to see all the other XO users in my neighborhood (actually it seems to extend pretty far past my immediate neighborhood).  I actually like Sugar… (plus I think the Matchbox WM/ single app on screen is alright), though I really dislike Journal. I run Emacs in sugar when I work in the shell so I can split the screen that way, but for the most part Matchbox doesn’t seem annoying. I also use the real evince instead of the not as good evince-derrived “read” activity.  I have closed source flash instead of gnash, and opera just because it's quicker to launch and find something that way than to fumble with the browser activity.  Those things combined make the XO a very useful device, and I get to keep my mesh capabilities and the creatively designed Python Sugar UI environment.",1211860755

If, looking at a single application, one could take away from the browser all the things that a particular application does not need, what would that application's size be?

We've just put up a beta and would love to get your honest feedback (even the brutal stuff.)<p>http://kinverge.com/<p>Registration is required, but it's just an email and password. (The site lets you upload photos and other content, and lets you invite others to your group, so it's easier to check it out within your own user account rather than using a single generic test account.)<p>Really interested to hear your input and advice.  The idea for the site grew out of our frustration with not being able to keep track of family information -- photos, birthdays, giftlists, announcements, etc. -- all in one place.  We also wanted to make that place so easy to use that even our non-tech-savvy family members can participate.<p>What do you think?  What's working for you, and what should we be doing better/differently in your opinion?",1211859856

200647,comment,200230,200344,0,0,gnaritas,,,"Do you remember before Google?  Do you remember how bad search engines sucked and how irrelevant the results were?  Google was smart enough to see that when lot's of pages link to a site, that site must be considered relevant by a lot of people.<p>Ranking results by inbound links was the breakthrough that made search actually work.  Paid links are bad, they allow people with money to game the system and make irrelevant content show up in the search results.  Unless you're a spammer or an SEO, Google is doing the right thing for the user.  It is the user after all, they're trying to serve, not middle men trying to arbitrage the system.  Ideally, they figure out a way to make spamming and SEO completely irrelevant, that industry needs to die.<p>You act as if you have some <i>right</i> to show up in their search results, guess what, YOU DON'T.  It is Google's search engine, they have every right to do with it as they please, including exclude anyone they wish.<p>Google's logic isn't flawed, yours is.  Google's search results are not a free market, they have every right to game their own system to make them money and there's nothing unfair about it.

I didn't even have to read the whole article.<p>We found this to be true today...a couple of independent folks talked about our product in a thread on Slashdot, and we had our best sales day ever.  All tiny sales...but a whole heckuva lot of them.  And, they'll probably be the kind of customer that keeps coming back, assuming we keep them happy.  And in all cases, we're finding that folks are saying, effectively, ""All of these things suck, but this one over here sucks a lot less...and they fixed it when I told them X was sucky.""  And all along, we've been trying to remove the stupid features and add in new functionality without adding new complexity to the UI (as best we can).  I think the battle against increasing complexity is a battle worth fighting, and I become more convinced of it every day.",1211858382

200639,comment,200451,200564,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Unless you have a partner that will take care of the marketing and sales side of things, that's probably a mistake.<p>There are several things that making the effort to new customers will give you:<p>1. Money.  If you have more paying customers, you have more revenue.  More revenue means you can pay to make problems go away.  Taxes, accounting, web design (if that's not your forte), and even the sales process itself (though it's almost certain that no one can sell your product better than you can early on).<p>2. More feedback.  You might be going the wrong way.  Early adopters have a very different set of requirements from the average user (generally).  So, the more mainstream your sales process becomes the more likely you are to find out that you're on the wrong path.  It's very easy to keep going further and further into a niche--and if that niche is too small, you're gonna be in big trouble before you even realize it.  It's entirely possible to featurize yourself out of the big markets by focusing on the tiny niches that your early adopters live in.  For example, our early adopters tend to push for scalability solutions for single websites--but our mainstream customers just want to fit more customers onto the same box.  If we spend all of our time building scalability solutions, we'll find ourselves only being able to serve 2% of the market extremely.<p>3. More users who can help you help other users, via forums or mailing lists or wikis, and can help you make more sales.  It is a reinforcing cycle.  We had an amazingly great sales day today, because we got mentioned by people we don't even know on Slashdot.  Because we reach out to our community regularly, we support the sites and communities that would use our software, and we (or I, rather...Jamie is full-time on coding, always) try to close a deal with a new hosting provider (even small ones) every week or two.<p>Building a better mouse trap isn't going to make you rich.  You have to ""ring the cash register"" sometime, or you not only won't get rich, you also won't be serving your customer as well as you should be.<p>But, I do think the blog post in question spends a bit too much time on checklists and making elaborate plans.",1211857926

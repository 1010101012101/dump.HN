If they're considered MA residents, as individuals they're going to have to get health insurance or pay a monthly fine.  That maybe wouldn't a big deal financially, but it'd be yet another procedural pain to deal with.",1189036643

Take them or leave them, but I will say from experience, it is good advice!!!",1189036072
50766,comment,50710,50722,0,0,dood,,,"Yes, problem isn't quite the right word. I originally used 'dilemma', but changed it to be in line with the blog post, I should have left it.<p>The dilemma, as I see it, is choosing the appropriate abstractions, and choosing when to abstract yourself. For example, SQLA can be used as an SQL kit + a little personal ORM, or using their ORM, or their ORM with Elixir, or their ORM with your own thing, or some combination of the above. Or if you're the blogger, write your own declarative layer.<p>Not that its a particular problem in the Python world (indeed afaict Python is ahead of the game in this regard), but it is a significant issue for much Python development, worthy of exploration.",1189035644
50765,comment,50509,50509,0,0,uuilly,,,"Almost everyone here is a young healthy male.  Pretty much the only thing we really need health insurance for is car accidents.  If you ramp up your deductable > $1000 health insurance will cost less than your cell phone bill.  Your company could give everyone high deductable insurance and agree to pay their entire deductable if they get in an accident.  Barring a freakish number of accidents you'll probably save a bundle of money.  Of course this doesn't account for people with chronic health problems.  But they're not likely candidates for startups anyways. ",1189035600

For me at least, it's much easier to parse the page if there's some kind of visual cue to help me keep track of where I am on a page.<p>Also, I've been on the web long enough to have learned to scan over and ignore ads (image and text ads), and a list/block of text without bullets or numbers screams ""avert your eyes... ads!!"" For example, the main content of the page looks very similar to the Google ads on the right column (with the exception of underlines), while the RSS feeds with the bright orange icons screams ""look at me on this page of monotony!!""<p>I hope this helps. Keep up the great work!",1189035318

50755,comment,50436,50645,0,0,gwenhwyfaer,,,"Sounds like someone who's watched way too much House, frankly. It's laziness, just as much as lying because you don't want to hurt someone's feelings is laziness; it's a different path of least resistance, that's all. There are ways to tell people the truth that aren't brutal; tact and empathy are hard, sure, but that doesn't make them useless or optional.<p>Nonetheless, there's a difference between caring about people and caring about people's feelings. The latter is really all about oneself; if you lie to avoid hurting people's feelings, you're really trying to avoid them being pissed off at you. If you don't think someone is able to process the truth, better to say nothing at all.",1189033958

50753,comment,50456,50681,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Google is a total slut for a high GPA, make no mistake about that.<p>Google also has a list of schools that are considered top-tier, and if you're not from one of those, you're unlikely to be hired.  I don't believe Google has always been this way--and I think the pressure to raise the hiring bar in so many artificial ways comes not from any elitism, but from the fact that Google is hiring way too fast, and the folks at the top know it.  By ruling out everyone below a quite high academic threshold, they've cut down the number of applicants under consideration.<p>I suspect, but don't know for sure, that if you have a long track record of producing good results, you can still get hired by Google.  I received a recruitment letter from them, but never followed up by going through the hiring process to find out if someone with a couple of two year community college degrees (and no computer science classes at all aside from AP high school classes--I tested out of all of the computer-related classes for my degrees) could get hired there, based on the strength of accomplishments, alone.  The letter came two days after I accepted funding from YC, and a few months after we started making money with Virtualmin, so it wasn't really of interest at all.   But now that I think about it, it would have been an interesting experiment.",1189033498

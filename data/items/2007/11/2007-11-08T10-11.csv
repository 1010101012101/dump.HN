Sounds like one of those PR gimmicks where they manage to publish bogus numbers and then use those numbers to sign on new customers. ...""</i> <p>Could be right. Have you followed this thread where I posted an NYT article that turned out to be just such a sub. [0] <p>I would have thought the blogging section as an editorial of sorts (not cash for comment) was immune from this. Maybe not?  Certainly if you want to push the Journalist on this point they might cough up the real motivation for the story. <p>The articles cited source is here ~ <a href=""http://www.barracudanetworks.com/ns/news_and_events/index.php?nid=222"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.barracudanetworks.com/ns/news_and_events/index.ph...</a> and like you point out, hardly an unbiased view. I'm beginning to think the viewpoint of a lot of <i>""New York TImes""</i> articles are compromised and not worth posting.<p>[0] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=70836"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=70836</a> and here ~ <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/bootload/1685662827/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flickr.com/photos/bootload/1685662827/</a>",1194516162

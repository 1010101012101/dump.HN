You're not always going to hook up with the best person and if you find a new person move on to them. Looks aren't everything. As Ben Franklin observed about having sex with older women ""All cats are gray in the dark""<p>I've been in relationships with girls who had multiple partners who thought this way. They were sluts. (same goes for guys on the other side of the deal). I've also been with girls who had multiple partners who were extremely loyal.<p>Yes -- people who are uninhibited, risk-takers, and have poor judgment skills are not the kind for long-term relationships. But that set of people does not include everybody who has had multiple sex partners, even though all of those people are probably promiscuous. You're being silly.<p>It's much wiser to spend your time creating boundaries about how you deserve to be treated, not about what somebody's past is. Get out. Meet people. Date. Have sex if that is what comes natural to you. If you don't feel like it, don't have sex. But don't go berserko over past sex partners.

As a web developer at Yahoo, I've seen this argument many times over the last 3 years.  Here's the cliff notes:<p><i>Hacks Proponent</i> With star-property and _property, you can serve a single css file, reducing the number of requests.<p><i>CC</i> So, serve ie.css and standards.css.  IE doesn't get standards.css.<p><i>Hacks</i> But, then you have to maintain two copies of the css.  That sucks.<p><i>CC</i> Nuh uh!  You have a script that concatenates them.  You still write ie-hacks.css separately, but your build process tacks it onto the end of ie-production.css.<p><i>Hacks</i> With the IE-targeting star-property and _property hacks, you can keep the hacked code close to the ""real"" code.  Even if you concatenate in production, you still have to have two separate files.  If something changes, you have to remember to change it in two places.<p><i>CC</i> So, have your build script pull out the star-property and _property rules from your single CSS file, and only serve them to IE with conditional comments.<p><i>Hacks</i> But, then you're doing exactly the same thing as having these hacks, but <i>also</i> maintaining a script to do what the browser gives you for free.  More complexity in your build process = more room for bugs.<p>And that, generally, is the end of the discussion.  Occasionally, you get this:<p><i>CC</i> But those hacks can't target a specific version!<p><i>Hacks</i> But IE<6 is not supported anyhow.  How specific do you really need to be in your CSS? Have you ever actually targeted a browser version other than ""ie lte 6"" or ""ie lte 7""?<p><i>CC</i> That's not the point!<p>These are the reasons that, as a matter of corporate policy, Yahoo generally prefers _property and star-property to conditional comments.",1238366181

That generation and their children will generally have good qualities. But if a few generations are fairly well off they will start getting bad qualities – people start to think that they are entitled to everything and do not have to work for it.</i><p>I don't know how strongly it correlates to being wealthy. There are poor people who feel entitled (consider the subprime debacle and the massively inflated house prices in much of the country ca. 2007) and rich people who don't take anything for granted. It has more to do with culture than wealth.<p><i>In a few years you get the situation that kids drive to school in their cars, watch Paris Hilton programs and start to have sex at 14.</i><p>The car thing is just the status quo in the US; almost everyone has a car, because so many places lack public transportation. I drove to school in a car, but a used one.<p><i>As for feminism – it is a good idea, but the pendulum swung too far to the one side.</i><p>I think the nasty elements of ""feminism"" actually have nothing to do with feminism. For example, <i>Sex and the City</i> is <i>not</i> feminist in the least. Women should be allowed to have careers, should make pay equal to that of men, and shouldn't be looked down upon if they decide not to marry. However, glamorizing a rather crass lifestyle that most normal people would find unfulfilling does nothing for the feminist cause.",1238364923

It used to be fantastic - there wasn't much spam in them early days so people were quite receptive to the emails and we would make lots of money from them. Hey - they were free to send and they make you lots of money - what can go wrong with that?<p>Well, unfortunately that formula is a bit addictive and it gets to the point where if sales are low, the top management start demanding to know how many thousands of emails we have sent that week. What they don't realise is that the days of just email marketing your way to success is over - email marketing is now spamming and people hate it.<p>Nevertheless, send 10,000 emails and we might make one sale which is still worth a few thousand so how can we resist?!<p>What isn't appreciated is that this strategy is overall damaging the company. People now associate us with ""those people that send spam"". It was only relatively recently that we moved to a proper email marketing service with an opt-out option and as a result I managed to get us removed from a significant email filter black list (which, ironically, we subscribe to).<p>Anyway, do I have any useful advice? Check the legality re: data retention etc. I'm not actually 100% on the rules but I do think they differ between the US and Europe for example, which I think might depend on where you are based, rather than where you are sending to.<p>Email marketing /should/ be opt-in, not opt-out. However, I guess giving your business card must be considered opting in as I always seem to start getting more marketing emails after a conference. It's ok though as they all do it properly and have an opt-out link in the email...<p>Just sending marketing is a bit of a fail imho. Nobody thinks to themselves ""ooh I can sign up here to receive marketing material!"" Have an interesting newsletter talking about your industry, or publish white papers and thought leadership articles. Be subtle and demonstrate your expertise.

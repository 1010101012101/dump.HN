It's google for business, but I believe it's free (or relatively cheap) for education institutions. Theoretically all those users would be using Google and perhaps Google+ with enough encouragement.<p>Many other schools choose MS Live and those students would not necessarily have any reason to use Google+. Interestingly, at least at UMass Boston, the primary justification for MS Live was because MS claims it can identify the physical machines your data is housed on, whereas Google does not make such promises.

Same may apply to handbags as well.  Although you may perceive women handbags to be very different from each other, there are categories of handbags where it's harder to create extremely different designs due to constraints, for example many evening clutches are similar because they are all required to be small.  Should cloning be allowed if constraints prevent designs to be significantly different from each other?<p>It would be an uphill battle to try and prevent all those fashion companies from filing design patents for products limited by constraints.

Please, do not mistake this as a commentary on patent infringement, but rather the sheer inanity of some of these jurors' statements:<p>""There are other ways to design a phone. What was happening was that the appearance [of Samsung's phone] was their downfall. You copied the appearance.... Nokia is still selling phones. BlackBerry is selling phones. Those phones aren't infringing. There are alternatives out there.""<p>Nokia and BlackBerry are hemorrhaging money. They are dying. They are proof that alternatives are <i>not</i> out there. I am not claiming this allows patent infringement (nor am I saying whether infringement occurred) but that was a simply ridiculous statement.<p>Additionally, the fact that ""One of the jurors, believed to be Peter Catherwood, is a project manager with AT&T"" presents a huge issue to me. The carriers are incredibly staked in mobile phones, and AT&T is a greatly invested in iPhone's success--their Android selection is poor. How can no one who reviewed this jury have said ""maybe we shouldn't have a manager from AT&T""?<p>Finally: ""Hogan was jury foreman. He had experience. He owned patents himself...so he took us through his experience. After that it was easier.""<p>I've already seen a number of people criticize the foreman's leadership, but I'll add.

However I feel that a design patent on a tablet form factor is not the best idea. Perhaps it works for fashion designers, and I am not denying that there is creativity in designing hardware devices.<p>However, as I look at all the various LCD monitors that are around the office right now, I can't help but think about what would happen if there was originally a design patent on the form factor of a monitor. They all seem to have relatively similar:<p>- border widths
 - button placements
 - rounding of corners
 - status lights and their positions<p>The same could be said for keyboards, computer towers, even many laptops. There is probably a finite number of practical design available when building a touch screen tablet. If all of them were to be patented, then nobody could build a reasonable tablet.<p>In response to your second point about the scrolling: It may well be true that the scrolling implementation was non-obvious. Based on your comments, I would agree that this particular aspect is perhaps non-obvious.<p>I'm just worried about the number of patents being asserted, and that it is highly unlikely that all of them are non-obvious, especially based on the coverage I have read. It seems more likely that Apple hit the big one with the iPhone by building incrementally on existing technologies and techniques, then adding some nice, non-obvious features, rather than building a device so chock full of non-obvious ideas that nobody else would have developed <i>something</i> which was <i>somewhat similar</i> to what we now think of as a smart phone using similar technology.<p>I don't think the few non-obvious ideas, nor the fact that they brought together existing technologies should be the basis for court fights and attempts to block importation of competitors products.

A program that implements a new technique which forms an important part of a research project. Maybe a program that <i>is</i> the research project, which will be described in a paper.<p>No doubt this code should be included with the publication, no matter how ""ugly"" it is. Some journals, e.g. Bioinformatics, already require that an article about software must include the software itself. This is the stuff the Bioinformatics Testing Consortium would run a smoke test on, because amazingly, a lot of programs that have been written up as journal articles just don't compile or work at all on somebody else's machine; many articles don't include the source code, and some don't even say how to get a redistributable binary. That's wrong, and we can fix it.<p>2. The mountain of single-use scripts and shell commands that are used in a research project that's not really about software at all, only a small fraction of which produce some output that the scientist follows up on.<p>Key points: (1) this code is very unlikely to work on anyone else's machine as-is; (2) crucial parts of these pipelines are lost in the Bash history, or were executed on a 3rd-party web server, or depend on a data set on loan from a collaborator who is not ready to release the data yet; (3) almost all of the code is dead; (4) whatever comments or notes exist are usually misleading or completely wrong.<p>As an example of what can go wrong when this code is released as-is, remember when the East Anglia Climate Research Unit ""hide the decline"" stuff hit the fan? It wasn't clear which code was dead, the comments made no sense, and people freaked because they couldn't be sure how the published results came out of that godawful mess. The eventual solution, way too late, was to make a proper open-source, openly developed software project out of the important bits. That, in a nutshell, is why scientists won't release ALL the code -- even the hard drive itself is not the whole story; the scientist still needs to be available to explain it and navigate over the red herrings.

4437080,comment,4435389,4436893,9,0,nivla,,,"> most of the things you list appeared originally on the Mac<p>Since you seem like a fanboy who loves to make up facts without any basis. Let's iterate over the list one by one in more detail:<p>1. Finder Sidebar: Windows Navigation pane -> Appeared in Mac = Mac OS X 10.3 Panther = Two years after the Navigation pane appeared in Windows XP.<p>2. The Mac Path bar: Windows Address bar -> Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard added an optional Path bar at the bottom of folder windows to display the path of any selected file or folder. Double-clicking a folder in the path opens that folder. This feature first appeared as the Address bar in Windows Vista, which began appearing nearly a year before Leopard shipped.<p>3. Back and Forward navigation buttons in folder windows -> Microsoft first put the Forward and Back buttons of Web browsers into its folder windows with Windows 2000. Oddly, Apple first included only a Back button in the original Mac OS X. It wasn't until version 10.2 Jaguar that a Forward button appeared.<p>4. Minimizing to document windows into app icon -> Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard adds an option for minimizing, which is turned off by default. Instead of creating a new icon in the Dock, you can have a document window minimize into the application icon it belongs to, as Windows has been doing with taskbar.<p>5. Screen Sharing: Remote Desktop Connection ->  Appeared in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard which was already implemented in Windows XP.<p>6. Time Machine: Backup and Restore -> Really? Do I really need to prove that System Restore and Backup n Restore appeared before Time Machine??<p>7. System Preferences: Control Panel -> Before Mac OS X, Mac system settings were found in a set of separate files. Microsoft  put all the settings in one convenient place. For Mac OS X 10.0 Cheetah, Apple stole Microsoft's idea and called it System Preferences.<p>8. ActiveSync and Exchange 2007 support -> Macs have long been second-class citizens to Windows when it comes to Exchange Server. Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard added native support of Exchange Server's 2007's group scheduling, contact, and mail services.<p>9. Command-Tab: Alt-Tab -> Well you agreed to that.<p>10. Terminal: Command Prompt -> Windows has had the command prompt integrated since the very first version. Apple finally added Terminal finally after the 9th version.<p>Love your products and be loyal to your manufacturers, that is one thing but please don't turn off the logic side of your brain!!

4437078,comment,4436063,4436464,2,0,PakG1,,,"I had a co-worker once who used his debit card at an ATM at a coffee shop nearby our office.  Somehow, some genius had installed a mechanism in the ATM to read the stripe and the PIN.  So they were able to take that info and create a fake debit card that replicated my co-worker's debit card.  The next week, his bank account got cleaned out.  He was absolutely broke and went through a few weeks of hell trying to get it all sorted out.  Fortunately, the bank was able to help him out.  I don't know what happened with the police investigation, but basically none of us used cards at that coffee shop again.  The coffee shop was still operational, and I think the police were somehow able to determine that it wasn't the coffee shop at fault (maybe only a single employee or an ATM maintenance guy, not sure).<p>I think this is why a lot of debit cards have chips nowadays.  The chips are harder to counterfeit (I think).  But I think we still have to grandfather all the old debit cards without chips.  :(",1346032849

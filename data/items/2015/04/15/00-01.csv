This is a convenient regulation for politicians because it appeases certain people and attacks an easy scapegoat, but it will have a minimal effect on the quality and quantity of housing available, and on the price of rent.",1429059587

9378251,comment,9374842,9376760,0,0,schoen,,,"Just to put the issue in an extreme perspective, suppose that the best mathematically possible attacks against AES-256 in some setting only reduce the attacker&#x27;s work by the same factor as the best mathematically possible attacks against AES-128.  (There&#x27;s no proof of this now, but it&#x27;s conceivable that it&#x27;s true.)  In that case, the decision to use AES-256 in a particular application instead of AES-128 improves security against cryptanalysis of AES by a factor of 2¹²⁸ steps for the attacker.  (Maybe cryptanalysis of AES isn&#x27;t actually the weak point anyway, but let&#x27;s set that aside because that&#x27;s what inventing new ciphers tries to address.)<p>If this hypothesis is true, the work that Daemen and Rijmen did to invent AES-256 and the work that a particular implementer did to implement it will produce an almost inconceivably vast security benefit against this particular threat.<p>The reason this is important is the kind of disproportionality between the effort of Daemen and Rijmen and the AES reviewers and implementers, and the magnitude of the resulting security benefit.  They might have spent a total of 500 person-years on making AES-256 work well, and received a security improvement of 340 trillion trillion trillion trillion-fold <i>relative to whatever the security of AES-128 is</i>.  Whereas a homegrown cipher that isn&#x27;t very mathematically sound might be developed with 1 person-year of effort and end up make an attacker do, let&#x27;s say, 100 trillion operations.  In my hypothesis, Daemen and Rijmen and other folks then got somewhere between a trillion trillion trillion and a trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion times better security return on their effort.<p>Now you might reasonably point out that if you use a standard, known cipher, the attacker&#x27;s costs for a direct brute force attack are purely computational and don&#x27;t involve research and development, or attempting to suborn or hack your correspondents or colleagues to discover the principles of operation or your system.  Whereas if you do have a homegrown mechanism in play, an attacker incurs these other <i>kinds</i> of novel and sort of one-off costs, notably including making other human beings think about stuff more.<p>The point that I&#x27;ve taken from a lot of the security experts who&#x27;ve talked about this, though, is that the scaling benefits are the important factor here, again especially if you want to make a system that many people could use for a long time.  When the limiting factor is computer time, which is really only likely to be true for systems created, refined, and reviewed by experts, you can sometimes get the really absurd security ratios that are hard to even think about, and require your adversary to spend more money than exists in the world, build more computers than can be made from all the silicon on Earth, consume more energy than the Sun outputs, etc., etc.  When the limiting factor is human reasoning, you might say &quot;but that would require human cryptographers to think about my system for 1 year!&quot;.  But if that&#x27;s so, that may actually happen, and in any case you can&#x27;t easily get the order of magnitude of the costs and resources required up to &quot;inhuman&quot; levels.<p>The point I&#x27;d take from your idea is that it could be valuable to try to make adversaries incur <i>diverse</i> costs in attacking your system, especially if you don&#x27;t know what capabilities and resources your adversaries do and don&#x27;t have.  This is kind of akin to what&#x27;s happened with key derivation, where people have proposed KDFs that are very CPU-intensive and also KDFs that are very memory-intensive, and if there are other sorts of resources that you could make an attacker burn, there are probably people trying to invent KDFs that burn those, too.  It&#x27;s not clear to me that there&#x27;s a genuinely scalable way to require human analytical effort as one of those resources, but if there is, that could be a useful property for communications systems to have for defense in depth.  But making up a new cipher by hand for every system is probably not going to provide that property very reliably, or be a very effective use of resources, again when other uses of resources can improve security to a staggering extent.",1429058586

If I was designing a compiler frontend and optimizer/backend in concert I would definitely use it unless some other constraint prevented it. In addition to not having to generate a non-SSA program and then immediately throw it away, it allows you to do basic optimizations during SSA construction that you would probably do immediately after constructing SSA anyways.<p>The two major downsides would be extra complexity in the frontend and the impossibility of using the algorithm for SSA repair after IR modifications. The extra complexity in the frontend can hopefully be hidden behind an abstraction, and a lot of serious compilers end up using a separate implementation of SSA construction for repair anyways, so I don&#x27;t know how big of a deal these drawbacks really are.<p>I am one of the authors of the &quot;highly-optimized implementation of Cytron et al.&#x27;s algorithm&quot; that is used in LLVM. That is a bit of a misattribution; I changed LLVM to use the DJ graph algorithm by Sreedhar and Gao before they took their measurements for the paper.

D-Link, Linksys, and crew don&#x27;t usually roll their own SoCs, but just seem to throw off the shelf stuff in there. These chips tend to be SoCs, and while I can&#x27;t be totally sure that there isn&#x27;t a weirdo NSA backdoor on it (probably just as likely as any other router, residential or commercial), most of the meat lives in the chip, and with good open source firmware (DD-WRT et al.) it&#x27;s probably just about as reasonable as anything else coming and going. I certainly have far more faith in a regular off-the-shelf SoC + open source firmware tuned to my own needs (and believe or not thisn&#x27;t hard at all) than anything with propriety firmware, including (and especially, to me) Apple. Maybe the next best thing to do is to build your own WiFi router from totally off the shelf parts (not so hard to get into a small form factor any more).<p>As to inspecting the SoC itself, that would be certainly interesting.

Redesigns of apps may be absolutely amazing and objectively better but that doesn&#x27;t mean they will see a lot of adoption.  People don&#x27;t automatically adopt things that are better.  People flock to apps or interfaces like birds.  That behavior doesn&#x27;t tell you   which things are better.<p>Of course, you can do a good UX design and good graphic design (both together, but they are two different aspects) and then use psychology and network effects to your advantage.  Or just switch interfaces on a certain part of the users and then the rest may be jealous.  Or other tricks.<p>Marketers want you to believe something fancy and trendy and expensive is better and so people want that status.  That isn&#x27;t the same as being actually better.",1429056240

But it is really strange to read that on Quora of all places, the site that had to resort to hiding answers just to force people to sign up, whose purpose and business model seems completely unclear (&quot;the startup that missed the chance to be bought&quot;), and which is not really a leader in design as well (though I don&#x27;t think its core is badly done), apart in using tricks to stimulate initial participation.<p>That is not even off-topic, he mentions it in the article and links to an answer (<a href=""https://www.quora.com/Why-should-or-shouldnt-you-migrate-your-blog-to-Quora/answer/Mills-Baker"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quora.com/Why-should-or-shouldnt-you-migrate-you...</a>) on why people should move content from Blogs to Quora, as a counter example to Medium.

The tl;dr is that you get lots of nice properties for free, and that it makes writing analysis algorithms much simpler with fewer edge cases.<p>For context, I was involved for a bit in writing this book, and I was at the conference that spawned it, and I wrote chapter 25. That said, it&#x27;s been a few years and my memory is poor, so I may have some details below wrong. I&#x27;m basing some of this on a fun paper I wrote (<a href=""http://paulbiggar.com/research/fit-2009.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulbiggar.com/research/fit-2009.pdf</a>) and stealing directly from my PhD thesis (<a href=""http://paulbiggar.com/research/#phd-dissertation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulbiggar.com/research/#phd-dissertation</a>, section 3.3)<p>Factored use-def chain: With a def-use chain, dataflow results may be propagated\ndirectly from the assignment of a variable to all of its uses. However, a def-use\nchain requires an edge from each definition to each use, which may be expensive\nwhen a program has many definitions and uses of the same variable. In practice,\nthis occurs in the presence of switch-statements. SSA factors the def-use chain\nover a φ-node, avoiding this pathological case.<p>OK, english version: in program analysis, you want to know the value of a variable, so you create a &quot;def-use chain&quot; which connects a definition of a variable to all of its uses. In some cases, you might have very many uses and definitions, esp of the same variable. This esp happens with switch-statements. In SSA form, each variable is only defined once, so you dont get pathological cases here.<p>Flow-sensitivity: A flow-insensitive algorithm performed on an SSA form is much\nmore precise than if SSA form were not used. The flow-insensitive problem\nof multiple definitions to the same variable is solved by the single assignment\nproperty. The allows a flow-insensitive algorithm to approach the precision of a\nflow-sensitive algorithm.<p>English version: if you put something in SSA form, you can connect the use of a value directly to its definition (since it&#x27;s only defined once, with one value). Without SSA, you might have more definitions of that variable, and so not know it&#x27;s exact value, type, etc, when you go to use it. Without SSA form, to get that data you&#x27;d have to analyse the flow of the program (look at loops and if statements, etc). With SSA form, you can ignore those and get a similar level of precision.<p>Memory usage: Without SSA form, an analysis must store information for every\nvariable at every program point. SSA form allows a sparse analysis, where an\nanalysis must store information only for every assignment in the program. With\na unique version per assignment, the memory usage of storing the results of an\nanalysis can be considerably lower than using bit-vector or set-based approaches.<p>In English: When storing the results of your analysis, you can save them much more cheaply in SSA form, from a CPU and memory perspective. Without SSA, you need a hashtable of variables, with a list of values each. In SSA form, you only need on value, not a list of values, for each variable. You can also number single-assignment variables by number, rather than by name, and so use simple arrays rather than hashtables to store the results.",1429056129

1392051,comment,1391566,1391566,0,0,modeless,,,"The biggest problem with online advertising is what happens <i>after</i> you click.  Every time an extremely specific ad dumps you into a generic landing page or (worse) search results, that tells you ""clicking on ads is a waste of my time"".  Every time an ad makes false promises of any kind (""PS3 for $21.97"", ""You won a prize"", etc), it reduces the effectiveness of <i>all</i> online advertising because it conditions people to mistrust ads.<p>I think the only way to combat this is to have ""branded"" ads with guaranteed quality.  Google AdSense was the first example of branded ads online (that I know of); they had a unique style that indicated ""these ads are different"".  Unfortunately the style was quickly copied.  The only solution to the copying problem is to brand ads with a trademark, e.g. ""ads by Google"".<p>The quality of AdSense ads has deteriorated over time, so ""ads by Google"" isn't a real indicator of quality any more, but I think the concept is good and there's room for a new ""ad brand"" that only accepts real quality ads.  Ads that are honest, funny, pretty, respectful, and most of all take you somewhere good when you click.  Perhaps iAd could be it.",1275292061

It's fine that you haven't heard of all of MS's other billion dollar businesses, but perhaps that should leave you feeling unqualified to make sweeping commentary?<p>Here are some products off the top of my head that you've clearly never heard of:<p><pre><code>  * Business Productivity Online Suite (BPOS)
  * Exchange
  * SharePoint
  * Office Communications Server (OCS)
  * Dynamics CRM
  * SQL Server
</code></pre>
Exchange's market share is comparable to that of Google's market share of search (~70%), so I'm assuming that meets your definition of success based on market share.<p>BPOS has 40 million <i>paying</i> customers compared to Google Apps' 25 million <i>total</i> customers (which presumably only a tiny fraction of which are paying).<p>SharePoint is part of the Office division but is an entirely new product driving billions of dollars of revenue.<p>Etc...<p>There's no reason for you to have heard of any of this.  I only know all about MS because I work for MS.   But there's also no reason for you to talk about how MS reminds you of the ""starving artist dilemma.""",1275291124
1392035,comment,1391026,1391026,0,0,wanderr,,,"My favorite coffee shop actually charges less for iced coffee than hot, but:
-They brew hot coffee one cup at a time with very high quality coffee
-They use an admittedly lower quality coffee for iced so that it tastes stronger. It's still good, but their cost of supply is lower.
-They brew iced coffee in batches, so the labor involved in making 40 cups of iced coffee is significantly lower than 40 cups of hot coffee.<p>Side tangent: It annoys the crap out of me that Starbucks makes it /cheaper/ to get a large iced americano with 4 shots compared to a medium with 4 shots. Obviously a large americano costs them slightly more (bigger cup, more ice), but they should at least be the same price. Absolutely ridiculous that I have to pay more to get it in a smaller cup and have it be less diluted.",1275291106

1392018,comment,1391309,1391393,0,0,chipsy,,,"I think the problems with popular notions of dieting - and this is going to get OT, but my mind's on it at the moment - are intermingled with problems of praise and self-esteem in society. You can see, on almost any occasion, a women's magazine at the grocery store which will say ""lose 10 pounds!"" next to a picture of a giant chocolate cake slice. Anyone who has successfully dieted knows that it involves lifestyle changes, thought and research into making better decisions, and a gradual build of accomplishments and confidence over months/years, not a quick-fix recipe, and if you succeed, the chocolate cake will essentially leave the dinner table and your mind.<p>But the mindset of a fragile ego is to want an immediate resolution and insignificant changes to habits - whether it's through badgering others for acceptance(""there is no problem with me, right?""), falling for snake-oil pitches, using drugs, buying expensive medical procedures, etc. We don't educate people towards building real self-esteem, so we end up with a massive segment of our population perpetually sitting on the verge of severe emotional distress.<p>This is especially unfortunate because, at least how I understand it and was raised, self-esteem is cheap to create. It's formed by focusing the dialogue on real accomplishments and immediate consequences and avoiding attribute-based judgments(which have an unbounded magnitude and finality that make them impossible to frame in a positive way). You can find this theme running through books ranging from the classic ""Between Parent and Child"" (which my parents used), to a variety of books on business and networking, to Cesar Millan's dog training method.<p>Going back to dieting, the consequence of our corrupted dialogue is a glut of poor advice, guilt trips, and fad-following. Now that I've tried actually ""playing"" with diet, I've discovered that it can be a lot of fun; you just have to get away from good food/bad food/ideal numbers dogmatism and take a more from-the-ground-up, intuitive approach.",1275290467

2290460,comment,2289114,2290039,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"I hear you regarding Python.<p>Re: const inferrence - I have been thinking about it on and off for a while now and I think C++ has it backwards to what it should be. Consider the case when I am implementing some function and need to call <i>foo()</i> passing it variable <i>bar</i>, but don't want <i>foo</i> to modify it.<p>The way C++ offers to solve this problem is by having me first code a version of <i>foo</i> that swears that it does not touch its argument. So effectively I need to code <i>foo</i> in a way that anticipates const usage, i.e. make it forward compatible with const expectations of external code. Expectations that may or may not materialize, but yet I still need to be mindful of them. This seems excessive.<p>The way I would rather do it is to state that I expect foo() not to modify my variable when I'm <i>issuing a foo call</i> -<p><pre><code>  foo( const bar );  // note the spacious padding :)
</code></pre>
and then let the compiler decide if this restriction can be satisfied. Note that this example assumes that <i>bar</i> is a local variable. Another common case is when <i>bar</i> is a given and already a const, and then I can do just this -<p><pre><code>  foo( bar );
</code></pre>
In other words, const-ness should be a property of just variables. In a vast majority of cases deducing if a <i>function</i> is const can be done automatically -- and this is what I want from my compiler.<p>Am I missing something? This is a complex subject, so probably I am.",1299286483

(This should be printed and kept in your car, purse, and wallet. Good information to have with you.)<p>There are a few things that can be done in times of grave emergencies.
Your mobile phone can actually be a life saver or an emergency tool for survival.<p>Check out the things that you can do with it:<p>FIRST (Emergency)
The Emergency Number worldwide for Mobile is 112. If you find yourself out of the coverage area of your mobile network and there is an Emergency, dial 112 and the mobile will search any existing network to establish the emergency number for you, and interestingly, this number 112 can be dialed even if the keypad is locked. Try it out.<p>SECOND (Locked Keys in Car)
Have you locked your keys in the car? Does your car have remote keyless entry? This may come in handy someday. Good reason to own a cell phone:<p>If you lock your keys In the car and the spare keys are at home, call someone at home on their cell phone from your cell phone. Hold your cell phone about a foot from your car door and have the person at your home press the unlock button, holding it near the mobile phone on their end. Your car will unlock. Saves someone from having to drive your keys to you. Distance is no object. You could be hundreds of miles away, and if you can reach someone who has the other 'remote' for your car, you can unlock the doors (or the trunk).
Editor's Note: It works fine! We tried it out and it unlocked our car over a cell phone!'<p>THIRD (Hidden Battery Power)
Imagine your cell battery is very low. To activate, press the keys <i>3370#. Your cell phone will restart with this reserve and the instrument will show a 50% increase in battery. This reserve will get charged when you charge your cell phone next time.<p>FOURTH (How to disable a STOLEN mobile phone?)
To check your Mobile phone's serial number, key in the following Digits on your phone:      
                  </i>#06# .
A 15-digit code will appear on the screen. This number is unique to your handset. Write it down and keep it somewhere safe.
If your phone is stolen, you can phone your service provider and give them this code. They will then be able to block your handset so even if the thief changes the SIM card, your phone will be totally useless. You probably won't get your phone back, but at least you know that whoever stole it can't use/sell it either. If everybody does this, there would be no point in people stealing mobile phones.<p>And Finally....
FIFTH (Free Directory Service for Cells)
Cell phone companies are charging us $1.00 to $1.75 or more for 411 information calls when they don't have to. Most of us do not carry a telephone directory in our vehicle, which makes this situation even more of a problem. When you need to use the 411 information option, simply dial:
                (800) FREE411  or   (800) 373-3411
without incurring any charge at all.  Program this into your cell phone now.

2290421,comment,2290180,2290180,0,0,SpikeGronim,,,"I'll share my experience, which may differ from other people's. The largest system that I've worked on was Amazon S3. At the time that I worked there we were doing 100,000+ requests per second (peak), storing 100+ billion objects (aka files), and growing our stored object count by more than double every year. The most important skills for that job were distributed system theory, managing complexity, and operations. I can't explain all of these skills in depth, but I will try to give you enough pointers to learn on your own.<p>For distributed systems there are two main things to learn from: good papers and good deployed systems. A researcher named Leslie Lamport invented a number of key ideas such as Lamport timestamps and Byzantine failure models. Some other basic ideas include quorums for replicated data storage and the linearizability consistency model. Google has published some good papers about their systems like MapReduce, BigTable, Dapper, and Percolator. Amazon's Dynamo paper was very influential. The Facebook engineering ""notes"" blog also has good content. Netflix has been blogging about their move to AWS.<p>Every software engineer needs to manage complexity, but there are some kinds of complexity that only show up in big systems. First, your system's modules wil be running on many different machines. The most important advice I can give is to have your modules separated by very simple APIs. Joshua Bloch has written a great presentation on how to do that. Think about what happens when you do a rolling upgrade of a 1,000 node system. It might take days to complete. All the systems have to interoperate correctly during the upgrade. The fewer, simpler interactions between components the better.<p>The best advice I know of about operating a big distributed system is this paper[1] by James Hamilton. I won't repeat its contents, but I can tell you that every time that we didn't follow its guidelines we ended up regretting it. The other important thing is to get really good with the Unix command line. You'll need to run ad-hoc commands on many machines, slice and dice log files, etc.<p>How did I learn these skills? The usual mix of how people learn anything - independent study, school, and building both experimental and production systems.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.usenix.org/event/lisa07/tech/full_papers/hamilton/hamilton_html/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usenix.org/event/lisa07/tech/full_papers/hamilton...</a>",1299285644

Additionally, this desire to 'win souls' quickly wears off, and some never go through it at all.<p>----<p>Now, if you were making a sporting analogy and said that the mere existence of people who like Apple somehow causes the supporters of 'the other teams' to get more energetic in support of their team, that would make sense to me.  Sports fans need the existence of other sports fans to hate and whip them into a frenzy.<p>But (sadly) that isn't what you're doing here.  You are painting the Apple fans as the bad guys by making all these assertions about their behaviour and character.  Essentially, you are saying that they bring it on themselves because of their bad behaviour, and I don't believe that.  It doesn't match my observations at all.<p>-----<p>Let us examine your claims:<p>the only news you hear is either ""Apple did this""<p>I dispute this as factually inaccurate.  Right now, as I flick to the tab holding the front page, I see the following tally:<p>msft		2
startup	7
rampant rails fanboyism	1
digital rights	5
linux		1.5
apple	0.5
pop psych		2
world news	1
us news		2
fitness		1
history of the world	1
intel		1<p>(there was a story title for android and iphone, so I gave them each partial credit).<p>That's it.  2% of the news.  1/4 of what Microsoft is getting.<p>Now, when you say ""Apple did this"" I'm going to assume you mean people bitching about how evil Apple is.  E.g. the recent 30% debate.  Because all I remember recently about Apple is a bunch of bashing and sledging.<p>Essentially, you are saying that because you see people bashing Apple so often in the news, that makes you sick of Apple and want to bash them.  I cannot say that I see that as a reasonable justification.<p>Then you say the other side of the news, the pro-Apple side<p>""I WANT APPLES BABIES""<p>Now look.  I don't know if you've ever seen any Apple ads, but they never do that.  They are never garish and over the top.  Oh wait, the iPod ads.  Well, okay, I'll give you that one.<p>Now I like understated ads.  I liked the Microsoft ads with Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Gates, I thought they should have continued them.  I like the ad where the guy is texting while peeing at the urinal, and then drops the phone and goes to retrieve it and the guy turns to him and says ""really?"", and the kid throws the ball at his Dad's head because he's texting instead of playing.  But here Microsoft is taking a leaf out of Apple's playbook (sic).<p>For every loud garish Apple ad, I'll see you <i>ten</i> Microsoft party to install Vista ads.  You want annoying?  There's your culprit right there.<p>Moreover, I think you got the emphasis wrong, it is more like the two sides of the Apple news coin are like this:<p>""I WANT APPLE TO DIE IN A FIRE"" and ""Hey, Apple just put out new MacBook pros""<p>""you will start to form an overly critical view""<p>Not critical enough by a large margin.  Like I said in the first post, Apple is singled out for unequal treatment.  If your view actually was properly critical you'd view each company with equal suspicion.<p>""because the news seems to always tend towards hype""<p>But the hysteria end of the hype scale is filled with Apple haters.  Where Apple fits on the hype scale is in the 'large corporate announcing a new product' part of the scale.  But even there I give Apple better marks than most IT companies, since Apple actually delivers the products they are hyping (except the white iPhone).  Most other IT companies make all sorts of breathless announcements and then half the time  the product that is going to lead us into the promised land of milk and honey never arrives.<p>... but they never get called to task for it, or if they do, with only a minuscule fraction of the rage and bile that is directed at Apple.<p>""And then some people (with the same fanboyish mindset as the fanboys) will start to take it too far, still as a backlash""<p>Backlash against what though?  You've failed to establish the existence of raving Apple fanboys, and my experience completely disagrees with your assertion that the Apple fanboys are just as bad as the Apple bashers.<p>""You only get raging haters by either spectacular failure of delivery""<p>If someone says they hate Apple because they had a $mac and one day after the warranty expired it blew up and then Apple screwed them over, that would be fair enough in my book.  By all means, bring Apple to task for their <i>real</i> sins, but unless Apple has injured you, do not bash them for <i>imaginary</i> sins, unless you also bash other companies equally.  That is all I'm asking.<p>""OR by having raging fans. People seek to balance by becoming unbalanced.""<p>I just don't see the raging fans.  Apple is far too mainstream these days.  Maybe back in the 90s with Guy Kawasaki whipping the faithful into a frenzy of religious ecstasy, but that was <i>TWO DECADES AGO</i>.   For every Apple raging fanboy you show me, I will give you 100 Apple bashers.<p>Let's have a look at the comments in the MSFT threads.  In the first one, there are only three overt mentions of Apple.  One is apparently an IE 8 fanboy bashing n IE 6 fanboy (the mind boggles), and the reference to Apple is an extremely minor point by way of an argument by analogy.<p>The second is a response to someone who was bashing Apple, and suggesting that because they are taking 30% of subscriptions, they are unfit to serve as a replacement for Microsoft.  (In response to someone saying that we should just throw out Microsoft entirely (and not just IE 6)).  The overt mention of Apple is someone saying that leaving Microsoft is not the same as going to Apple, because there are other choices.<p>The third reference is someone disputing that, saying that there are no Linux devices for sale, and that for non-technical people it is just a choice of Microsoft or Apple.  (There is a response to that by a Linux fanboy, I know he's a fanboy because he misses the obvious logical retort that most Netbooks run Linux).<p>Anyway, by my tally in these mentions of Apple there are 3 Microsoft fanboys, 1 Linux fanboy and 0 Apple fanboys.<p>Hmmmm.... not looking so good for your theory.  Perhaps the other thread will prove more fruitful?<p>There are two overt mentions:  I'll quote the first since I can't identify its fanboy classification:<p>""Microsoft producing new software for Windows XP is like Apple doing the same for OS9.""<p>It is a little fanboyish, since it is kind of inaccurate (a better comparison would be Windows ME vs OS 9 in my view, since Microsoft introduced XP in August 2001 and (according to Wikipedia), Apple introduced OS 9 in 1999 and discontinued development on it in 2002), but never mind that nitpick.  So far as I can tell, this is not Apple fanboyism, this is just someone arguing by analogy, like the first example from the first article.<p>The second quote:<p>""Anyway, they supported it till IE8 and MS has one of the best track records for backward compatibility(if not the best) in the industry. Just see Apple to see how quickly things are deprecated.""<p>Okay, so here Apple is being shown in a bad light.  Microsoft is better than just about everyone at maintaining backwards compatibility.  And the person could have said that, but no, they had to slide in a little negative dig at Apple in the process.<p>Would you call that an example of rampant Apple fanboyism??<p>I hope not!<p>You see, this is how things are.  Apple fanboys as a general rule stick to their own 'turf' and don't engage in needless nerd-rages across the internet.  I'll admit there is probably a low level of baiting and trolling that is going on, but not at a higher level than the last guys snide side remark about Apple.<p><i>In fact, this quick survey shows enormously more Linux fanboy trolling than Apple fanboyism.</i><p>If anything, it also shows that people are out there actively trying to bait the Apple fanboys, but they aren't biting.<p>Of course, this is a limited sample, highly inaccurate, blah blah blah, but I think it goes to cast suspicion on your claims of bad behaviour by Apple fanboys.<p>""People don't like being told that someone else is better then they are""<p>Apple fanboys don't do this.<p>""Geeks, therefore, do not like being told that they are a poorer person for making different technology choices.""<p>Apple fanboys don't do this.<p>I'd happily accuse someone of making a poor technology choice if they go 'all in' with Microsoft technologies, but I wouldn't tell them they are a ""poorer person""<p>""As fanboyism can be quite judgmental""<p>Apple fanboys don't do this.<p>""this gets on people's nerves, and they become defensive, lashing out at the ""Cause"" (being Apple)""<p>So, despite a complete and total absence of Apple 'fanboys' attacking, it is okay to go on the defensive, and the best defense is a good offense?<p>Even in trigger happy USA you're still supposed to wait until you're attacked before retaliating with superior force.<p>""The fanboys feel that their identity is being attacked, and they fight back with equal fervor.""<p>But there aren't any attacks.  Oh, I'm not saying that if you go into a thread about Apple you won't see people arguing in Apple's favour, but there it is entirely in appropriate and in context.  The very thing you claim, the moral high ground of not lashing out except in defense, is <i>exactly</i> what the Apple fanboys do.  The very superiority you claim for Apple bashers is instead the high ground that the Apple fanboys are firmly encamped upon.<p>It is the Apple bashers who are the clear aggressors, who attack without provocation.",1299285462

Then what is your point? Not to be rude, but <i>why say anything at all?</i><p>How does anyone know it’s “best to keep them on their [old] software”? If no one used IE8, would not Microsoft also be free to use newer web standards to create better, faster-loading web apps with less development time? What <i>benefit</i> to Microsoft is there having IE8 users?<p><i>Edit:</i> Your reply <i>still</i> doesn’t show how you figure it’s better for Microsoft to have people on IE8 than on (say) Chrome, despite my possible counter-argument.

Success, but not what I'd call overnight. In between, we have...<p><pre><code>   - ""Burning the midnight oil...""

   - ""...I got turned down again and again and again.""

   - ""After 18 months of me beating down the doors of the HR department...""

   - ""Another 9 months and I got a call.""

   - ""...apply for *every* programming job in the last 2 1/2 years""

and so it goes for a little more.<p>I have to say, I leaned a little more in Max' direction when I first read it, but give it a little thought, and the real message is, don't give up hope! Getting and running your own company isn't going to be easy. You'd be crazy to think it is! BUT, if you're willing to work your ass off for it, you <i>can</i> get there.<p>Even if it takes five years.<p>Hell, it could take <i>ten</i>, or even longer, but if that's enough to stop you, it'll probably take <i>forever</i>, so why worry?<p>As for the talentless hack, you might want to look a little closer at his story, too. He might not be so talentless, himself. The guy you describe apparently knows enough to:<p><pre><code>   - Program (even if it IS VB6)

   - Reimplement existing software(?)
       (Not so easy to do without the source, and if he *had* it, then he could...)

   - Read other people's code (which could be even harder?!)

   - Talk someone in the right position at a big company into investing in it
       (and as if that weren't hard enough...)

   - Talk said someone into investing *a lot* of money in it!
</code></pre>
On top of all that, if a kid that talented spent most of his teen years reading science fiction and watching movies, I'd be <i>very</i> disappointed to learn he didn't at least try writing a little of either. You practically <i>have</i> to try, when you've got that kind of initiative.<p>So, yeah, you <i>can</i> do it. You'll have to work your ass off. You'll have to keep your eyes open, <i>and</i> you'll probably need a boatload of patience.<p>But don't let that stop you.<p>[edited for formatting]",1299283837

On a desktop, screen resolution and space allows you to position windows side-by-side or overlapping.  On iOS you have to double-tap, and select an app from the bottom dock to switch to.  Android has the same problem- you press the home button, and choose an app to switch to.  Both forces the user to focus on managing apps, instead of focusing on the desired ""task"".",1299283693

The single skill I picked up that served me best was being able to rationalize about what complex , highly concurrent code was doing and the performance implications of it.

All I'm saying is this: I punched in directions to Lao Sze Chuan in Chinatown last night, driving from Oak Park. I threw my phone on the passenger seat and drove. The sensible route it plotted for me was unworkable due to traffic, so I detoured through UIC campus. The moment I diverged from its route, without me doing anything, it replotted a new route, and then a series of new routes as I ignored those directions, until I got to Roosevelt and followed its directions the rest of the way there --- which were much better than the route I would have taken.<p>Obviously, I fall into a specific class of Maps user:<p>* Using directions primarily when I'm driving<p>* In a major city<p>But that's a big class of users and, so far, Maps is better for that use case.

4549444,comment,4547855,4548335,4,0,dchest,,,"Today I was writing a Skein hash function implementation in Go. Skein can be configured for different purposes (e.g. MAC, KDF, stream cipher, etc.), and it can accept >5 optional arguments. I wanted to expose all these configuration option to users, in addition to providing a simple version that will create hash without configuration. Here's how I solved it (there's prior art in some standard libraries).<p>I exported this struct:<p><pre><code>  type Args struct {
    Key       []byte // secret key for MAC, KDF, or stream cipher
    Person    []byte // personalization string
    PublicKey []byte // public key for signature hashing
    KeyId     []byte // key identifier for KDF
    Nonce     []byte // nonce for stream cipher or randomized hashing
  }
</code></pre>
and then provided a function:<p><pre><code>   func New(outLen uint64, args *Args) *Hash
</code></pre>
Users can easily call it like this:<p><pre><code>   h := skein.New(64, &skein.Args{ Key: someKey, Nonce : someNonce })
</code></pre>
I like this design a lot.<p>Plus, with structs as arguments you can easily provide more than one default configurations. For example, if you want to personalize hash for different usages:<p><pre><code>   var FileHashConfig = &skein.Args{ Person: []byte(""file hash for MyApp"") }
   var MessageHashConfig = &skein.Args{ Person: []byte(""message hash for MyApp sync"") }
</code></pre>
and use them:<p><pre><code>   h := skein.New(64, FileHashConfig)
</code></pre>
(Note: Args is a bad name for general usage -- I called it like this only because Skein authors call these ""arguments"", and ""configuration"" is reserved for something else.)<p>There are a few specified usages for Skein with arguments, so to avoid making users of my library read the Skein paper, I wrote ""constructors"" for them:<p><pre><code>  // NewMAC returns hash.Hash calculating Skein Message Authentication Code of the
  // given length in bytes. A MAC is a cryptographic hash that uses a key to
  // authenticate a message. The receiver verifies the hash by recomputing it
  // using the same key.
  func NewMAC(outLen uint64, key []byte) hash.Hash {
  	return hash.Hash(New(outLen, &Args{Key: key}))
  }
  
  // NewStream returns a cipher.Stream for encrypting a message with the given key
  // and nonce. The same key-nonce combination must not be used to encrypt more
  // than one message. There are no limits on the length of key or nonce.
  func NewStream(key []byte, nonce []byte) cipher.Stream {
  	const streamOutLen = (1<<64 - 1) / 8 // 2^64 - 1 bits
  	h := New(streamOutLen, &Args{Key: key, Nonce: nonce})
  	return newOutputReader(h)
  }

</code></pre>

Lapel mics give you better sound quality, but shotguns are good for impromptu situations where you don't have time to wire your subject.<p>Wireless is good for the obvious reasons.  Wired mics are really good only for sit-down interviews unless you can also put a recorder on your subject (which is possible -- iPod nanos make dandy audio recorders).  Don't worry too much about quality if all you're recording is people talking.  I'd avoid mics that are selling for $1.99 on eBay, but you can find excellent lapel mics for low 10s of dollars.  (Shotguns cost more.)<p>Yes, you can just plug a mic into the jack on your laptop.  You'll even get decent quality.  But 1) your laptop is probably much bigger and more power hungry than a dedicated recorder and 2) it probably only has one mic jack and you'll almost certainly want at least two no matter what you're doing.<p>If you're using an audio recorder that's separate from your camera, don't forget to put an audio marker on each clip so you can synchronize the sound later in post.  You don't need a slate.  You can just clap your hands (make sure you're in front of the camera and in range of all the mics).  It looks goofy, but it works.",1348159515

Tom Tom's data (they acquired Teleatlas) is one of the two best resources (the other being Navteq) for map data. How you use the map data is the problem and Apple haven't got it right this time, I would guess most of the testing was completed in the USA, so I would expect most major cities to be fairly fine. It's once you go internationally it gets bad.<p>I used to work on these types of issue half a decade ago (2007), and one way of testing the accuracy is to stream GPS data in  and test that it worked ok. We did this by - 
a)Test programme that could load and play GPS commutes. Connect to the phone as a bluetooth GPS device. PLay the commute (from multiple countries. 
b) on the phone - intercept the screen signal, using another programme, check the screen automatically to make sure the map was on the road (reading for road names and POI for more robust testing) We could run mapping/navi tests around the world without having to leave our desks.

Neverthelesss I had to assert something about the Go language designer's ability in order to refute the top post about mediocrity. Now you are back to talking about ability and credentials. We could go back and forth all day. The point is that Go is the first mainstream systems language to focus on leaving stuff out. Think about lisp, its beautiful because its really just one thing but you can do everything with that one thing. Go is not the same but the aesthetic is similar. It's a question of taste. Do you like a powerful tool with loads of abstractions? Or do you like to strip everything down to the metal and see what is the minimum you can run with and still retain most of the fire? Some of those things that you leave out may turn out to be those things that have come out of ""modern language design"".<p>Scala has many modern language features yet Martin Odersky said, of Go ""I like a lot of the design decisions they made in the language. Basically, I like all of them."" He can appreciate it because there is also an aesthetic in Scala that focuses on a minimal, simple, consistent core. But Scala has a shell with a bigger surface area. Depending on the context and the kind of person you are you might want one or the other but there is no point in criticising Go by saying ""Its missing feature X"". That's like criticising a race car because it doesn't have a sat nav. It still does 80% of what a normal car does but it does the core things that a car does really well and its not just that you have less weight its also that you can focus on driving it because there is less to distract you. (Where driving == building cool stuff faster because I'm not constantly getting distracted by thinking about how to make the code more clever ('Hmm maybe I could metaprogram that and save another three lines')). In general the simpler car is also easier to fix and easier to understand (these attributes are more important in programming languages than in cars, no matter what the ability of the programmers (cognitive load)). Of course there is an argument for having a sat nav in other contexts.",1348158779

You can divide the world up into squares and store different squares on different servers, but long roads cross many squares, big objects like country borders belong in many squares, and when you're zoomed out your view covers many squares.<p>The server also has to be clever; I don't actually want every road in New York or the data would take forever to load. I only want the major roads when I'm zoomed out.<p>All these problems are solvable - spatial databases like PostGIS have been able to perform bounding box queries for years - but I don't know of anyone using PostGIS to support the millions of users Google have. It's well known that for regular data Google has things like BigTable, fancy NoSQL stuff that's supposed to scale well; I assume they have a geospatial database along similar lines. It's possible Apple decided to develop something similar.<p>My guess as to how [1] came about is that the user started zoomed out, so they only got sent major roads, then when they zoomed in some hiccup prevented loading the minor roads. This could have been as simple as the user's wifi going down, or it could that Apple's database servers are overloaded or have bugs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/63010000/jpg/_63010615_f786cb79-0711-4a44-9d2f-a4dab5f290cb.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/63010000/jpg/_63010615...</a>",1348158621

My dad wanted science/math, I wanted letters, the whole thing was resolved when we went back to the US.<p>In college, I spent a year at trinity (in Ireland), and I found that ""majors"" focused almost exclusively on one subject.  Medicine and Law were done at the undergrad level, starting at age 18 or so (though they lasted longer than a typical bachelor's degree in the US).  Math students studied math almost exclusively - to the extent that they branched out, it might be physics or CS.  The ""general undergraduate requirements"" were far more considerable in the US.<p>Lastly, as a grad student here in the US (at UC Berkeley in Industrial Engineering), I definitely noticed that much of the initial coursework appeared to be review for the international students.  This may partly be due to strong math education overseas, but I also think that the earlier specialization had a lot to do with it - when you only focus on math as an undergrad, you can do a lot more of it.  I actually think this may turn out to be a big problem for students who came up through the US - I see some merit to our more generalized system (I <i>think</i> Paul Graham referred to it as a ""late binding"" educational approach in an essay).  But in grad programs with high attrition rates, the US educated students may be at a disadvantage the first couple of years even if they are very talented.<p>EDIT - It occurred to me what you might be saying here... students may specialize in a subject earlier overseas, but the curriculum for that subject is much more standardized than it would be in the US.

As I've watched my kids' schools deal with crap like No Student Left Behind, I'm completely convinced we are not optimizing for learning or creativity in any way.<p>When you look at how well kids can learn when they are interested and curious and how little our schools use that curiosity, there is no question that things can be better. Just because we've done it for 100 years doesn't make it the right or best way (especially when schools became factory training grounds in the late 19th/early 20th centuries). Test scores are a horrible way to measure success in education because it fails to show anything about creativity and ability to continue learning, which are the things a knowledge-based economy need more than anything.<p>There are a lot of really good teachers out there who are completely hobbled by the structure of the system. It's a complex problem, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to come up with better solutions.<p>FWIW, I think we should start smaller. I would like to see students move through their education not with an age-based cohort, but rather a capability-based cohort, and they can get pushed back to a lower cohort if they aren't achieving (my understanding is this is how China's system works; if I'm wrong here, <i>please</i> correct my knowledge). That would remove the ""bored smart kids"" that cause problems in class and who fail out as soon as they hit something hard (that almost happened to me in college) and it would remove the ""frustrated dumb kids"" who give up on being ""able"" to learn from the equation. Both of these groups would just be challenged at their level, and the teacher would be able to focus the lesson plan around it.",1348157375

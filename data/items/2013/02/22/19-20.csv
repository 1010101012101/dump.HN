5266392,comment,5264767,5266211,3,0,VeejayRampay,,,"Let me clarify then:<p>I think that a consensus was built in the mid-90s that Java was a pain in the ass and not an improvement over what was available in that particular field at the time (not as easy as other higher-level languages and not as good or fast as C or C++).<p>I have a feeling that people over time consolidated that consensus through some form of confirmation bias even though the Java/JVM ecosystem had made strides towards a brighter future. And I say that as someone that doesn't even like Java in the first place (or at least doesn't see himself enjoying coding with it).<p>But it's hard in 2013 to look at what Java and the JVM brought to the table with disdain. \nJava is nowadays a very fast language that deals with memory management extremely well (not a good feature in some fields of course, embedded or real-time systems come to mind), that offers a rather sane Java-flavoured OOP paradigm, tons of tools (from IDEs to debuggers to servers) and an extremely well-crafted documentation.<p>The JVM also enabled Scala, Clojure, JRuby, Rhino, Vert.x, etc.<p>Now I totally understand and agree that the picture of Java nowadays is still far from perfect but I was more pointing at the slight disconnect between the actual capacities of the language and its perception by the programming world at large. Overall Java and the JVM are pretty damn good tools to use and meet the needs of lots of different niches.",1361563166

Search? Google, Microsoft Bing, and any number of other search providers could do that at the fraction of the cost. Peer review? No, that is performed by independent scientists, who are either not paid, or paid a negligible fee. Editing? Nope. Scientific journals are not edited for content or even proofread; I know a few professors who found that out the hard way after discovering typos in their own articles. Typesetting? OK. I'll give them that one. So, for the cost of thousands of dollars to the original researchers, on top of the outrageously high licensing fees paid by people who wish to read the articles, we get papers that have been typeset.

Reasons:<p>- Availability of good IDEs.<p>- Good dependency management and build infrastructure via Maven.<p>- Quick and easy deployment via servlet containers.<p>I am not a big Java fan, but having written quite much code, feature-wise there are not that many advantages of Go over Java. Package management in Go is nice for an early system, but will become a mess eventually, since there is no version management at all. Goroutines and Gochannels are nice for concurrency, but not all that great for parallelization.

All you had to do was say:<p><pre><code>    RenderGameFrameForEveryPossiblePoint();\n\n    ... // Who knows how much time\n\n    viewerPosition = QuicklyGetViewerPosition();\n\n    TellTheGPUToShowWorldAccordingTo(viewerPosition);\n</code></pre>\nWell then, you could postpone calling those last two functions until the absolute last minute.  This way you have very little or no movement of the viewer's head between when you read their position and when you show the view for that position.<p>But naturally, RenderGameFrameForEveryPossiblePoint() is <i>slightly</i> out of bounds of current technology.  A lot of what Carmack was discussing, as I understood it, was simulating this effect as closely as possible.  The way to do that, it seems, is:<p><pre><code>   StartRenderingGameFrameAccordingTo(lastViewerPosition);\n   \n   ... // Stuff\n\n   viewerPosition = QuicklyGetViewerPosition();\n\n   viewMatrix = ComputeViewMatrixDelta(lastViewerPosition, viewerPosition);\n\n   FinalizeGPUFrameRenderWithNewViewMatrix(viewMatrix);\n</code></pre>\nThat final bit is just a perspective transformation of a bunch of rendering that was already computed and given to the GPU.  But if the viewer moves too quickly, you can easily move somewhere in the world that wasn't actually rendered, or your perspective could shift such that and object that was once occluded is now visible, or vice versa.  It seems a lot of the complexity is there.<p>The last thing he talked about, time warping, seems to be a similar thing only it's scanline by scanline.  So in effect you're saying ""hey, video card and display, I know you're going to force me to draw a whole frame at once, so I'm going to give you a frame where each scanline gets rendered a little bit into the future according to where the player is moving.""<p>The effect on a monitor would probably look like a forward shear, but on an HMD (if done correctly), it would correct for the natural shear caused by having to ""freeze frame"" the viewer's perspective for one entire frame instead of just a scanline.<p>Some of this may be woefully incorrect, but it was how I explained it to myself.

Once you understand economics (Economics in one lesson by henry hazlitt is a very readable place to start, but Austrian business cycle theory is the real deal) you can see how things are going to go pretty clearly.  Which is why in 2001 when the mises institute was predicting a housing bubble (long before even Krugman advocated creating a housing bubble) ABCT let me know that it would eventually pop.  I put this theory into practice with a variety of financial instruments and profited from it.<p>The thing about real science is it lets you make predictions.  Oil is very critical and this guy is onto some really good stuff... but economics in a broader sense and monetary theory in specific, is also hugely relevant.<p>The biggest tragedy of this kind of knowledge, though, is watching people make bad decisions (like buying houses they couldn't afford) based on nonsense they were told (essentially propaganda).  Even someone who knows you a long time and thinks your a genius will believe CNN, politicians and their own desire to buy a house and ""get in on the action"" over wise counsel.<p>Which ultimately left me with this conclusion: People get the world they create, and they are complicit in its creation.   How many people who hate the PATRIOT ACT and NDAA voted for Obama?  How many should have known?  How many people who wanted prudent financial management voted for Bush? How many should have known they would get deficit spending?   How many were tricked into voting for one of these guys with the idea that the alternative was so much worse...when in retrospect they aren't that bad (Bush, for instance, never cracked down on abortion like we were told to fear in 2000, and he was in office 8 years.)<p>What if everybody actually demanded their government was honest, prudent, and abided by the constitution?<p>So, yes, use everything you can to understand geopolitics, because we're in a time of great upheaval- or close to it.

Most of the things people do in modern IDEs were done in Smalltalk (albeit, with uglier interfaces and some manual steps) over a decade back. One of the differences, though, is that these things were mostly highly responsive, because they were bloat-free. (Can't speak for IBM VisualAge. Also, one could rightly complain that they were feature-poor in their stock configurations.) This is in stark contrast to other IDEs and app server frameworks, which would take <i>forever</i> to start up, or <i>forever</i> to restart, or <i>forever</i> to complete an operation. One example, Extract Method, was always instantaneous. It's still lugubrious even in modern IDEs like XCode4.5.<p>The same rules that apply to Web Apps also apply to programmer's tools. Delays are yuck. Responsiveness is yum!<p>I'm also a musician, and from what I've seen playing around in Audacity, 5 milliseconds is definitely inaudible, even to some of the most talented, golden-eared musicians I know. I suspect that 20 milliseconds is going to start to bug some people, though they won't be able to say why.<p>Also, awareness of subtle modulations of very small variations in rhythm and how they affect the feel of music seems to be an indicator of intelligence and aesthetic awareness.

The remaining hurdle is sufficient density. They think they can do it but we'll see.<p>I was not claiming that a complete working design exists, which obviously is not the case since they haven't yet achieved net-positive fusion in the lab. Nobody has managed that yet, but focus fusion's ratio of neutron count to input power compares pretty favorably with other approaches so far.<p>I don't think it's silly to make an informed speculation about what a power plant would look like, if the basic idea turned out to work. NIF for example has been doing a lot of that with their LIFE design, to the point of sourcing specific components.<p>In the case of focus fusion, most of the power is released as a pulsed beam of charged particles. You can get energy from that by aiming it through a coil, no heat engine required.

The chief problem is that without eye tracking, it's incredibly UNFUN to use your head for movements that your eyes could otherwise have done for you. Mind you when the HMDs were much heavier back then it sucked a lot more, but it's still pretty shitty not being able to glance aside.

This lead to policy that the 3D effect could not be used for anything related to actual gameplay mechanics, reducing it entirely to an optional gimmick.<p>Simulation sickness affects even more people than the 3D issue.

Permission requires consent, which is something you give separately from the actual card number.<p>A minor point, but I think it changes the tone of that statement.<p>> possession of credit card data amounts to the capability to charge any arbitrary amount to it<p>I'm not sure anyone is ignorant of this fact though, and yet everyone seems OK with it.<p>> Not only should future payment systems be based on cryptography, but they should also require an affirmative step on the part of the payer to initiate a given transaction of a given amount. In other words, it shouldn't be a matter of handing over your card number, or even a one-use cryptographic token, and letting the merchant fill in the details. You should have to explicitly send an amount of money that you specify. Then, of course, a smart merchant would verify that the amount is correct before fulfilling her end of the bargain.<p>Ugh, no thanks. The system you describe is more like cash. I have to actively dole out the necessary amount, and then receive change that is counted at each transition. I abhor these types of transactions.<p>Convenience is a significant motivator in the adoption of credit cards. Any competing system will have to compete on simplicity. The fact that consumers and merchants haven't fled from credit card use as fraud rates (and costs) have increased is evidence that the market is willing to bear them.<p>The legislative changes that allow merchants to charge a CC-use surcharge will resolve the significant matter of ignorance. I do agree that consumers are largely ignorant of the hidden costs of fraud associated with the current CC model. The question is whether they'll pay these costs once they're brought to light. I believe they will continue to pay them in exchange for convenience.",1361561595

Its only lately where various things have come together to get close. I have followed the 'head mounted display' technology closely since its early inception in the mid-90's as a means of providing military pilots with situational awareness.<p>The first problem with head mounted displays was resolution. Both in color space and in pixel space. Early displays were monochrome (either green or red based on LED display drivers) and had a roughly 256 x 256 dot pitch. It was ok for targeting reticules and basic instrumentation display (like an artificial horizon). Early work also wanted transparency (look through) displays because there wasn't a way to display what you were looking at in enough fidelity to do both the visual field and the indicator field.<p>Later a company called Colorado Micro Displays (CMD) came to market and started offering color, but 320 x 200 was the best resolution they could do. Higher resolution displays cost tens of thousands of dollars and were essentially hand crafted out of unobtainum. Direct retinal illumination displays attempted to get past strict display resolution issues (a friend of mine worked on one of the x-y positioning device for doing this, it had 500 angstrom repeatability! And was, as expected, insanely expensive)<p>It really hasn't been until recently when DLP type systems at sufficient resolution to eliminate the x-y type beam director have come to market. Combined with better LED phosphors to bring the cost of an RGB display with better than VGA (640 x 480) resolution into something practical.<p>The incessant push to higher resolution phone screens has created the capability to make opaque but high resolution screens which can enable something like the Oculus Rift type displays. That requirement stems from how far away from the eyes you have to put the screen and thus the torque moment that is applied to your head. There was a great system at NASA which used 10"" displays but the 'head mounted' part was more like sticking your head into some weird steadycam kind of device.<p>Finally there is the challenge of both high fidelity and high frequency head orientation technologies. Prior to about 2005 the best you could do was a laser gyro for motion and an accelerometer for inertial reference. Doing that at the necessary frequency (typically 1000 updates per second) didn't become cost effective until about 2009.<p>Now however, many of the technologies have finally matured to the point where OR can be done in small quantities for perhaps $2K/unit.<p>A 'game console' is struggles if it costs more then $300. So as a 'controller' option, and even as the 'whole console' option, these sorts of glasses are still about 3 - 5 years from hitting a price point that makes them the 'killer' peripheral. And of course because they aren't here yet, they can't really have 'missed' :-)",1361561476

Also includes 715 respondents for \n2011 who indicated definite plans for ""other full-time degree program.""<p>That 715 is 1.5% total, or 25% of the 6% difference between 2006 and 2011.<p>I spent nearly all my time between 2006 and 2009 around grad students (mostly physics, but bio and engineering too). There was a fundamental shift in thinking in 2008, both for grad students and professors. Professors could keep grad students working after their PhD was conferred, in a position somewhere described as between a postdoc and student for a year or two, a longer holding pattern - because people were having a hard time finding jobs. This goes double for international students.<p>According to this ( <a href=""https://chronicle.com/article/From-Graduate-School-to/131795/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chronicle.com/article/From-Graduate-School-to/131795...</a> ), 23000 more doctoral students are receiving some sort of financial aid from the government than in 2007. Even if those numbers are increasing, the total percentage of people with a masters or higher is only 1.5% of the apparent population.<p>According to BLS, there's ~3.2 million people with a PhD. That means there was an increase of people, from ~.3% to ~1% of total people applying for aid. (I'm probably off by a little bit because I'm using numbers from different years and estimating, but not by a factor of 2)<p>So, we had an increase of 20,000 people applying for some sort of aid between 2007 and 2011 with a PhD. Cumulatively, if we were assuming that increase was purely from new grads and accurately portrayed the unemployment of a new grad, that would mean an increase of 5k year over year, or 11% of new graduates. But to say that was all new graduates would be doing quite a disservice: There has been major cuts in research at national labs, universities, and all sorts of other publicly funded institutions.<p>I'll admit, finding the right job is probably harder and takes longer today than in 2006/2007.  I agree that we have much more foreign students who have a harder time figuring out what they will do after graduation, because of problems with visas and money. But at 2.5% unemployment and a median salary 50% higher than a bachelors degree, ( <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm</a> ), I think it's hard to argue there's PhD bust.<p>If I had more time I'd delve into this deeper, but I got to get back to science...",1361561411

5266098,comment,5264312,5264312,3,0,geebee,,,"One of my career goals is to get a programming job without having to show that I can add a leaf to a binary tree through recursion (again).<p>I don't mean this as flippantly as it might sound.  I used to think it was kind of fun and exciting to be at the whiteboard, thinking on my feat, dealing with various curveball data structures and algorithms questions.  I certainly always read up on this stuff prior to interviews, and from what I've heard, I'd be advised to do it again if I get an interview at google or something.<p>But the last time I did this left me depressed.  I realized that I've done so much of my work in obscurity that people are still asking me about binary trees.   I want to be very clear that <i>I don't blame them</i>!  I also started to realize  that I have a lot more to offer than my ability to traverse various tree structures, and that the interviewers seem unaware of this.  But it's up to me to show them, not on them to just take me at my word.<p>The last time I went through a massive, all day technical interview, I didn't get the job, partly because I didn't review my data structures and algorithms book (again), but probably also because I came off as cranky and irritated.  I was busy that week, probably should have put it off.<p>Just earlier that week, I had taken several clients from pharma and semiconductor companies through some beta testing of our software, refining the model, getting feedback on use, optimizing the code base so it could give answers more quickly.  The company I was interviewing for created supply planning, forecasting, and inventory management software for various large businesses.  As a math major with an MS in Industrial Engineering and a background writing software, it was right up my alley.<p>My interviewers showed no interest in anything other than my ability to code or a couple branches of math.  In fact, some of them seemed so inexperienced that I'm not sure they were aware that this kind of experience even exists to be asked about (Oh, you work with clients? Our project managers do that).  At lunch, one guy asked me how to swap two integers without creating a third integer.  This is after a full morning of technical grilling on math and programming, with a lengthy afternoon to follow.<p>Fortunately, I'm now in a job where I am encouraged, not just allowed, to contribute to open source, do presentations at conferences, try to build communities, and so forth.  I would not consider any job that did not have this element (and now that I have a job like this, I'm not looking anyway).  But if I were to look around, I would vastly prefer to be hired for my known and widely used code base than for my ability to detect cycles in linked lists, implement a hashing function, or print out all possible permutations of a string (with no duplicates!).<p>I'm not there yet, but that's my career goal.",1361560614

Usually I'll start with a symptom that an end-user might see and then allow the candidate to ask me for any additional information (as either the end user or a system admin giving them log files and other things) to help them narrow down what the problem might be.<p>It is a little tricky to make it possible for them to make progress without knowing anything about the hypothetical code base, but I like it because I think troubleshooting problems is a decent indicator of someone's skill and knowledge: Do they have a good approach to narrowing down where the problem is? Do they know what kind of information to ask for (for Java devs, I like to ask questions that lead them towards asking for thread dumps or heap dumps), which shows mastery of a language/platform? Do they ask good questions in general?<p>I've also seen people use printed stack traces and ask the candidate walk through what the stack trace is telling them and what the possible root causes might be - this is more useful when you want to test someone's knowledge of a specific framework.<p>Handing someone an application in a broken state and watching them work through the process of debugging it would seem like it would be interesting, but I've never had the time to prepare this for an interview.",1361560597

This issue, however, has been coming up recently (3-4 major articles in the last 45 days or so) and there is a growing ""let's get rid of it"" sentiment, but without proposals for an alternative. If you take a peek at my conclusion again, you'll see that this is what I'm asking for. An alternative.<p>>If you consider the statistics, a 3% citizenship rate is indicative that the H1B program is not really a immigration program at all -- it is actually a guest worker program.<p>Read again please, I agree with this exact point in the second section of my comment. I made the point that it's not the worker's choice, it's BigCo's choice. The system is set up to serve temp-workers to BigCo. I've supported this exact idea in the 5 bullet points I've made above that. What I disagree with was the implication in the original article that guest workers didn't <i>want</i> to naturalize. ""less than 3 percent of them applied to become permanent residents"" makes it sound that way. They can't apply themselves!<p>I don't need lecturing about how guest workers have limited freedoms. I know firsthand! I'm not too keen on servitude myself! It's not that I don't think rocking the boat is a good idea, but I'm wary and scared. Do you know how many alternative visa program / immigration reform bills have been proposed so far? And how many have been passed?

This is where you're creating the table<p>> Is there a test database somewhere?<p>Yes. It's set up by default at the beginning.<p>> Why do I have to call run() when there's a button saying ""Run this query"" do you sometimes not run() things?<p>Because you can type multiple queries in the text box. Every time you end a query with `.run()`, that's when it goes to the server and gets executed there. We've been talking about not having people type `.run` for a single query, but it's a bit difficult to solve.<p>> What happened to r.db('test') that I needed to use? Is r now that database?<p>If you omit r.db() at the beginning of the query, it picks a default one (which is 'test'). It's the same as you'd do in MySQL.<p>> Why didn't I just do r.tableCreate('tv_shows') before?<p>We thought allowing tableCreate in a default database allows people to make mistakes too easily, so we disallowed it.

RethinkDB supports multiple databases. You can specify which one to use on a per connection basis or for each query.<p>The 'test' database is a default database (in principle it's similar to MySQL's test database). Being the default also means that you don't need to use `.db('test')` in each query.<p>`run`: ReQL allows chaining multiple functions together. Basically creating a query is a bit like using a builder pattern. These chained ops are all sent to the server and executed on the database. There is a single roundtrip. Basically `run` tells the query builder: ""now it's your time to do something for me"".<p>As side comments<p>1. initially we added much more details about each query, but we ended up with quite a bit of text compared to short queries. We thought it would be more intuitive the reduce the description part and provide links to the API. It looks like that wasn't the best solution.<p>2. we chose to have the query pre-typed instead of having it part of the description only as we assumed mostly everyone would just copy paste it. Assumption proved incorrect!<p>Thanks a lot!<p>alex @ rethinkdb",1361559607

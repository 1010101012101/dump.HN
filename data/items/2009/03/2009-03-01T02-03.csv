498719,comment,498581,498713,0,0,amix,,,"At Plurk.com we use both LightCloud and memcached. They complement each other. I.e. memcached is used for caching stuff - to reduce the load to MySQL. LightCloud is used to store persistent data - such as how many times a plurk has been read.<p>You could also store this in MySQL, but generally, storing key-value data is not the force of a relational database such as MySQL and LightCloud (and other key-value databases) are optimized for this kind of storage.",1235875904
498718,comment,498431,498431,0,0,sanjayparekh,,,"I probably shouldn't chime in but since my name was brought up a couple of times I feel compelled.<p>Yeah, I'm Indian.  Yeah I'm American too (born and raised in Kentucky).<p>Is there prejudice in the world?  Yeah, sure.<p>Have I experienced prejudice/racism?  Of course - and not just in Georgia or Kentucky but all over the world.<p>Does it matter one bit (at least to me)?  Nope.<p>Anyone that shows prejudice (based on race or otherwise) is someone I don't need to be friends with, do business with, or interact with.  I've never felt like a customer wouldn't buy because of some racial prejudice or an investor wouldn't invest because of the same.  If they did, would I even want to do business with someone so small minded?  No, I wouldn't.<p>Starting a company is hard.  It doesn't matter if you don't have one hurdle or another - there are a lot of obstacles to a successful liquidity event.  Entrepreneurship isn't a path where success is guaranteed.  If it were, everyone would do it.<p>So my point is this - sure, prejudice may exist and you may think it will hinder you from succeeding.  So what?  No one said this was going to be easy.  On the contrary, the large potential rewards upon success all but determine that it will be very, very difficult to achieve (go read an economics book if you don't get the reasoning as to why).<p>So just get to work, start your company, and be successful. This stuff is all noise and if it derails you - you need to become a better entrepreneur/leader rather than complain that someone kept you from succeeding.",1235875902

498715,comment,498238,498603,0,0,anamax,,,"IANAL, but this sounds like a class action lawsuit or an argument that MS has stolen something from you.  (You paid good money for that license as evidence by the sticker.  You have something that purports to be the program that you paid money for, but the two don't work together because of affirmative measures by MS.)<p>In many/most US states, they can't get around the implied warrantee of fitness (the thing that you bought does what they said it would do when they sold it to you), which at the very least for an OS includes ""installs"".",1235875755
498714,comment,497951,498077,0,0,jleyank,,,"I did a quick skim, but I didn't see any mention of the laws of the state for things like IP, employee mobility, etc.  As I recall, MA is rather restrictive and so things like non-compete clauses have some meaning there.  CA, on the other hand, ignores such things.  I would think that the ""business environment"" is critical - too pro-management and the workers won't go and take their risks in that environment.<p>The comment re: NC/RTP is spot on.  The natives are content, slow-going folks.  The imports are more active, but the slow-n-easy environment probably slows them down eventually. The triangle's a bubble in the midst of a lot of farmers...",1235875738

I scanned the AM channels for 30 minutes trying to find a traffic report to figure out what was going on. Then it hit me, search twitter for ""tahoe traffic"" and sure enough the first tweet was a report that CHP had stopped traffic due to icy conditions. I got off the highway and took a different way home.<p>Thanks Twitter.",1235874867

In my experience all the host does (worked for a managed hosting company) is set up the servers and keep them running, their help really can't help you with tweaking queries or tuning the db. I can't speak for on engine yard specifically. But I wouldn't bank on your host knowing anything beyond the basics of databases.",1235874338

Renting in Silicon Valley is not that expensive.<p>It's a very involved question why Silicon Valley has pulled ahead of Boston.  People write whole books about it.  I think the elaborate theories are probably mistaken, and that it's mostly due to a combination of historical accidents (Shockley Semiconductor specifically) and the quality of life in the Bay Area.",1235873867

4056707,comment,4052719,4054134,2,0,einhverfr,,,"While I agree that terrorism is given disproportionate attention (add car-collision fatalities in <i>September 2001</i> as 3300 and it becomes even more useful comparison-wise), I also think it misses the point.<p>The sorts of terrorism we are afraid of tends to hype fear over risk.  Take anthrax for example.  Anthrax has been floated as a biological weapon because it's unlikely to spread back and contaminate one's own area, but experiments with weaponized anthrax shows an abysmally low rate of contracting the disease (between 0.1% and 1%) and so it's nearly exclusively a weapon of fear.  The very things that make it attractive as a biological weapon also make it ineffective (no person-person transmission for example).<p>Similarly when we look at nerve gas attacks and the problems and sole case in history, it's clear these are relatively ineffective terrorism-wise.  VX may be more effective than Sarin given high-tech dispersal systems but it's also very sensitive to things like droplet size and it's not volatile.  Sarin, OTOH, is volatile meaning you can expect it to dissolve in the air and spread that way.  Despite that, Aum Shinrikyo would have been more successful using plain old high explosives than nerve gas, and only one of their two nerve gas attacks (the one under entirely ideal circumstances) resulted in any fatalities whatsoever.<p>Nuclear terrorism could be significant but I suspect you'd have to blow up a small nuke in a major city every ten years to have an effect similar to car crashes nationally.  I am sorry but I just don't see that happening so as long as I don't worry about getting behind the wheel I don't give that a second thought either.<p>All the above being said, cyberwar by non-state actors is <i>different.</i>  Traditional terrorist attacks seek to cripple a society or socially disrupt it by killing people and making them afraid.  I don't know that this necessarily has to be the intermediate goal of what people call cyber-terrorism (which is why I don't call it that).  Instead it can disrupt society and hold it hostage by, well, disrupting it directly.<p>Imagine if power blackouts and communications infrastructure was disrupted repeatedly.  Imagine if we suddenly the power grid were taken down repeatedly.  What would be disrupted?  How well could we recover?  What if telecomunications infrastructure was attacked as well?<p>People would die but that's not really the goal.  Just as in conventional terrorism deaths are a means to an end, sufficiently successful attackers could hold a society hostage by holding the infrastructure hostage.",1338602330

Ill go further: its been the goal all along but doesnt have traction.<p>SQL was designed as a business language, for end users (what we now call information workers). Didnt happen. There have been many promises of visual languages, just drag and drop components and you have an app.<p>The issue is not tools, but the fact that programming is a logical business. The best programmers are logicians  they have a robust mental model of a problem to be solved. The coding (and the tools) help, but they aint the thing.<p>Basically, being capable of manipulating Illustrator does not an artist make.<p>In fact, programming has been moving in the other direction: more people I know use Ruby on a command line than Visual Studios design surfaces.<p>The frontier is in end-user UI.

     Personally, I believe [data] is one of the best 
     ways for citizens to keep track of their government

     their owners want them to do. Raw data means 
     everyone has an opportunity to check each others

APIs are great, but are not the key to open government, for two reasons:<p><i>1. They don't provide simple and easy access for non technical individuals into raw information.</i><p>APIs shouldn't exist for querying historical datasets if the dataset is not already available in a static format. Release the data, then build an API if there is demand (or the private sector doesn't do it, better, for you).<p><i>2. Historical data access is poorly served by APIs.</i><p>There is no such thing as a good 'general use' API[1]. API's are appropriate for specific service based transactions that involve some level of processing. Examples:<p><pre><code>    * VAT/GST number validation
    * Road closure notifications
    * Identity services
</code></pre>
<i>3. Bonus reason: government agencies suck at building APIs.</i><p>They're not good at determining what is genuinely high value to end users, they tend to prefer visible projects that can justify budget increases, over genuinely useful, but less easily communicated ones (cf. the US national highway system and pork barrel politics), and there is an entire industry of enterprise companies heavily invested in keeping it this way.<p><i>TL;DR Release the data, let users build the APIs.

Apple has repeatedly stated that custom entitlements can and will be granted for apps that need access not granted by existing sandbox entitlements. Certainly not all exception requests will be granted, but for some of the ones he listed Growl, file read access for Omnifocus those are perfectly legitimate exception requests.<p>Apple is working hard to provide a secure and still fully functional system. Some things will break, undoubtedly. Some apps will be abandoned, either because of legitimate technical limitations Apple refuses to address, or because of political stances taken by the apps' developer. Things aren't perfect right now, and Apple still needs to continue refining and enhancing the OS X sandbox.<p>Is it as clear-cut as Rentzsch makes it out to be, though? Absolutely not. In fact, I think he takes a very biased stance in this article. For the vast majority of users, sandboxing is an enormous step forward for the safety and security of their data and system. For that reason alone, I encourage everyone to purchase apps via the App Store. It's a safe and trusted distribution vector that is now helping improve OS X's platform security.

Some agencies' data might be far better suited to publication in a CSV and posted on a web page, for example.<p>And for those cases, the agency can still justify why the CSV is better. There are always ways to get around the rules, see Section 508 rules for handicapped users.<p>>If a president could have a meaningful impact on this sort of thing, it would be in setting a high bar for the quality of information released by agencies. Any sort of requirement of this kind is completely absent from the announcement.<p>This is a step in the right direction, once the data is more accessible, the ""users"" (developers) can request for better data. The /DigitalStrategy page requirement is really good in my opinion and will make things simpler instead of the mishmash of sites buried in menus and behind authentication walls.<p>>So rather than being about transparency as it's being touted, the announcement is a celebration of high tech obfuscation. Soon the same sort of insulting, opaque, useless information spouted by officials in press conferences will be available via HTTP. This is at best a neutral day for democracy.<p>Whoever said this was about transparency in government? It's not about transparency per se.This is more about making information easier to access and find. In many cases agencies already have APIs, Webservices, data dumps, but they're really buried.

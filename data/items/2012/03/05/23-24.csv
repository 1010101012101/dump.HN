So you end up with some weird (but not faithful) representation of the sound which is a snapshot of the microphone's characteristics and directionality of the ultrasonic tones.  It's not reasonable to assume any microphone will behave exactly like a human ear.  Even if you could, you're going to have to mimic the tiny random movements a normal person would make listening to a sound, movements which would definitely impact the perception of the sound, because microphones are much more stationary than any human would be.<p>The ""different sounding"" argument two posts above is silly, because sound is almost never that monochromatic, and if it is, it's usually boring.  Also I don't understand how missing out on an odd order harmonic would be a bad thing :)  The reality is none of these arguments are based in a reality of what people would hear, and because of that, the arguments aren't practical.<p>In reality, 20 bits at 48kHz (or 64kHz) would be more than acceptable for even the most discerning of ears and probably the most practical in terms of space and fidelity, but it'd be a weird format to distribute in.",1330991434

As an experiment I once used 12 bands of parametric EQ to adjust the speakers in a cheap, old LCD monitor.  Sure, you're not going to get any better bass response than before, but stereo imaging (nonexistent before EQ, perfect phantom localization after), spectral balance, clarity, distortion (due to not exciting resonances in the monitor), etc. were significantly improved.  Most people could have added an EQ'd subwoofer to those tinny LCD speakers and been completely satisfied.<p>One of the many things EQ can't fix, of course, is room reflections, which can be helped by room treatments and speakers with a directivity better suited to the room.",1330991239

3668975,comment,3668454,3668679,18,0,aiscott,,,"As an integrated circuit designer I can say that a lot of hardware is somewhat less complex than the software world.  At the chip level anyway.<p>In the hardware world at the chip level, the environment is fairly rigid.  A designer has a pretty good idea of what the environment is going to be for their chip.  Linux is designed to operate in all sorts of environments: multiple cpu architectures, multiple versions of those architectures, the myriad peripherals, and all the other software that is going to run on linux.<p>That's not really the case with hardware at the chip level.  We know what chip we are going to be talking to, or what family of chips.  And most of those are designed in house, so there can be a lot of give-and-take going on.<p>It's just not a lot of combinations (compared to software, in my opinion.)<p>An exception would be memory, which is usually made by a third party.  And it's also where you find incompatibilities... some manufacturer's ram doesn't work in macbook pros, etc.  That's a bug.<p>And because the hardware can take a long time to iterate through design->implementation->verification->fabrication->prototype verification, there is a strong force driving designs toward being the simplest possible implementation that accomplishes the goals.<p>So you have these very well defined blocks of functionality that get pieced together and form a chip. The interfaces between blocks are very rigidly defined, and the amount of functionality in a given block is usually pretty limited.<p>At the level I work at, design is done in VHDL or Verilog (and now SystemVerilog is becoming a viable option).  So that's a limited space.  That could possibly be the biggest contributor to ""less bugs"" in hardware (if that is a true supposition).  I get flustered with all the different software programming languages.<p>A big disadvantage of hardware design is that testing is first done in event based simulation.  The tools available for this are pretty awesome, but it's still extremely slow.  My last design would take about 100 hours to simulate about 300 ms of hardware time.  That's a large part of why the iteration times are so long.<p>Now, with AMD and Intel, and designing these ridiculously highspeed CPUs, it's a whole different ball of wax.  I expect a lot of their design is transistor level, full custom.  Maybe they prototype in a higher level language, but you aren't going to 3GHz doing standard cell designs in VHDL.",1330990520

It does not refer to the audible sound spectrum.<p>20 kHz in speakers refers to the cycles per second of the audible waveform. Normal human hearing rage is 20 hz - 20 kHz. For most people, it's less than that.<p>A speaker can certainly play back music sampled 192,000 times per second.

There was a study done with a particular piece of classical music, with and without a particular inaudible component to it. The presence of the inaudible component drastically changed the listeners perception of the music. They described it as more dark or creepy (perhaps not the actual words used, but it matches the sentiment). The point is that there may be value in reproducing frequencies that we can't ""hear"", as inaudible notes can alter the experience of the music.<p>*not the study I was referring to but its along the same lines: <a href=""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=5291285"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=5291...</a>",1330988661

For example, the signal must be bandwidth-limited (and no finite-time signal can be).<p>But this is a minor concern, as there are many elements in the analog domain of the recording and playback chains that serve as low-pass filters - starting with the mics. So bandwidth-limiting is effectively achieved.<p>For a similar reason, the discussion of the ""harmful"" effect of high-frequencies to playback electronics and loudspeakers to be a bit overdone IMO. Peruse the excellent lab results of modern audio gear on Stereophile's web site. You'll find that bandwidths exceeding 30kHz are rare.<p>One last thing. When doing subjective ""testing,"" keep in mind that what some folks are hearing may be limitations of their gear. For example, most DACs derive their clocks for higher sampling rates (88/96/176/192) by clock-multiplier circuits. IOW, 44kHz and 48kHz are the only ones clocked directly by a crystal. These multiplier circuits are often noisy, contributing to jitter. The audible effect of this jitter is hard to predict.<p>Bob<p>PS As an avid audiophile, I find the clash of subjectivists and objectivists on this normally-buttoned-down forum to be a bit of a trip.",1330988445

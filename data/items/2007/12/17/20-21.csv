90437,comment,90387,90399,0,0,wastedbrains,,,"Jey I agree, I highly recommend Norvig and Russell's book. I had a one semester course back in college that used this. I actually just recently have been programming some of the exercises up in Ruby just to stay sharp with some different kind of coding than the standard webapp stuff. It has some great problems, and has source code available in many languages (not ruby unfortunately, but I guess makes it more of a challenge).<p>Norvig also has some great essays and example AI code on his site, <a href=""http://norvig.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/</a>",1197924479

90432,comment,90387,90402,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"In addition to this book, you're probably going to want a good book covering the history and development of the field.  <p>Keep in mind that AI is a broad field.  As such you might find it more helpful to identify which computer intelligence problem(s) you want to solve, then start accessing the AI writings that discuss how to solve your problem.  This won't give you a general overview, but it at least would reduce what you'd need to learn about to produce something useful.",1197924034

That is true, but the risks they take are calculated ones. The switch from IBM PowerPC to Intel x86 chips was a big risk at the time -- given the possibility of alienating Apple's customer base. The risks to branch out their product line from the Macintosh to the iPod, iPhone, and AppleTV were big changes. But even though these were game-changers, they still fit within Apple's core competencies. So, while Apple takes some big risks in some areas it is also conservative in others.",1197923894

90427,story,,,22,17,edw519,"Ask YC: Suggestions for Loved One's Dementia/Alzheimer's",,"This is slightly off topic, but not really, because it's still science.  This is one of the smartest groups I know, so maybe I can get help with a personal issue.  I am specifically NOT addressing this to a board that specializes on this topic, because I seek ""out of the box"" hacker-like thinking.<p>My mother is suffering from extreme dementia with a probable cause of Alzheimer's (her physician's words).  She has reached the point where she can no longer care for herself, so she is now in a skilled nursing facility.  She has stabilized and is receiving excellent personal and medical care.<p>She is 77 years old, ambulatory and active, lucid about 80% of the time, recognizes everyone, and interacts fairly well.  She has a lot of trouble verbalizing and gets confused quite often.  We are also starting to see classic memory loss.<p>My brothers and sisters and I intend to take full advantage of the expertise of her physicians whose specialty is ""geriatric care"".<p>Here is my concern.  Just like the blind men and the elephant, medical practitioners only have solutions to the problems they see all the time.  Like many other types of problems, in health care, sometimes you have to go ""outside the box"" to address things more effectively.  I know many people who have helped loved ones with many different health challenges by going outside the system.  But we know nothing about this condition.<p>In 2009, I don't want to say, ""Gee, I wish I would have done something back in 2007.""<p>Is there anything we should be aware of that our doctors don't know about (or won't tell us)?  I plan to email this link to my  brothers and sisters, so any comments, suggestions, or referrals would be greatly appreciated.",1197922872
90426,comment,90325,90362,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"The Vista DRM complaints are ridiculous. For one, it's ironic that everyone I know who bitches about it owns an iPod, which is basically the reason we're in this DRM quagmire to begin with. Nobody ever complains about Apple's DRM policies, and if anyone, they're the ones who should be telling the studios ""we won't sell your products until you ditch DRM"". They have game-changing power there, MS does not, as they're still an also-ran in the media sales industry.<p>For another, I've never had a problem with any DRM on Vista  because I just don't have DRM'ed files, and like 99.9% of America, don't have an HD-DVD or Bluray drive. It's certainly not box-breaking by any sane definition.<p>And lastly, but most importantly, Microsoft (and any other consumer OS maker) has no choice. See <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/articles/paedia/hardware/hdcp-vista.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/articles/paedia/hardware/hdcp-vista.a...</a> for details. We may all hate DRM, but it isn't Microsoft who is at fault.  Not that any of that is at all relevant to the NYT article.",1197922829

90424,comment,90325,90356,0,0,wmf,,,"The point is that more processor speed expands your possibilities <i>only if you are smart enough to actually use it</i>. Lazy (dare I say ""blub"") programmers <i>are</i> being left in the dust.<p>(Of course, this isn't the first time some programmers have resisted change. I remember a great rant about how if you program in assembly and never hit in the cache, the Pentium 4 was no faster than the Pentium III and thus useless. That guy probably quit programming entirely when multicore arrived.)",1197922388

How many software companies are cited in that article?  How many technologies are mentioned and/or explored?  In short it says ""Multi-core processors have potential, and [only] Microsoft has the best minds trying to exploit that potential.""<p>Parellelism has been available in less local forms for decades.  Supercomputers, clusters, more recently grid computing.  These aren't new problems for computer science, they are only new problems for desktop software developers that have always assumed a simpler processor architecture.<p>So imagine a program that could identify parallelizable sequences of instructions in other programs, and split the program accordingly.  Such a program may be able to exist, but it appears to be a very hard problem (it's even a hard problem for humans).  Vista is definitely NOT this program.",1197922039

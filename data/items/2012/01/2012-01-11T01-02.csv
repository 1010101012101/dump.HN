I've experimented with more and less and have settled on 13 minutes, which works well for me, and I'm sure it varies among everyone. If I'm really sleepy (usually from lack of sleep), even a 5 minute nap clears almost everything out the mind.<p>I think that the key to going right into the nap, nearly as soon as your head hits the pillow, is to have a routine of using a timer, and get up quickly as soon as the time is up. Then, you won't lie there worrying that you'll oversleep or thinking you should be doing something else more important.  Your mind is given permission to fall off, knowing it will come right back with the timer beeping.<p>I've found it helps to cover my head with another pillow, blocking out some light and noise. The head sandwich feeling is also relaxing and may contribute to my falling right out of consciousness in 10 seconds or less.",1326246843

3450113,comment,3449743,3449921,4,0,jeremysalwen,,,"I'm curious as to how it would look if you used some other measure of entropy besides local symbol frequency.  Probably a general purpose compression algorithm should give you a good idea, like gzipping the blocks.<p>Hmm, I'm not sure if this could work, but perhaps if you use a stream based compression algorithm you could relatively precisely see how much compressed data it takes to represent up to a certain point in the file, with only a single pass (rather than having to compress a huge number of local windows).  Of course this is probably going to weight earlier parts of the file heavier, simply because the compression won't be calibrated yet to efficiently encode.  So you could also run it on a byte-reversed version of the file, and a ""rotated"" version of the file (i.e. file[n/2:n]+file[0:n/2]), and a rotated-byte reversed version, and combine all those metrics together in some way (maybe min(entropy1,entropy2,entropy3,entropy4)).<p>That way you could get an entropy measure which compensates for the sort of alphabet runs that fooled shannon entropy.",1326246803

3450097,comment,3447048,3450030,0,0,surferbayarea,,,"Well! Google is a search engine. So if I search for my name, why should the google plus profile show up first, above the facebook or linkedin profile which probably has a way higher relevance score. Just because you decide to add a widget to detect a name and show the google plus profile as the first result, that to me is hacking the search ranking. From the blog-post, say if you search for music, it might bring up the gplus profile of a famous musician(not even in your circle or friends). Why should it bring the gplus page rather than the myspace page for that musician(which might have a way higher relevance)? That page is public, why don't you show that as the representative page for that piece of information rather than the self-promoted gplus page. It's ok to promote one's own product, all it means is that google search ranking now has a big if-then-else. If google-product, show at top, else push down :p",1326246451

They're just trying to make themselves a viable alternative to Win/Mac for everyday users and I think they're doing well. I myself prefer xfce and OpenBox over Unity, GNOME, and KDE too so I just choose to run xfce instead while leaving everyone else to use whatever desktop they like. It's better for certain distros to use the shitty interfaces by default so that normal folks are included while the rest of us use our skill to run an alternative. Also, there's too much of this idea floating around that doing everything from the terminal is a badge of honor. It's cool that you can but it doesn't mean you should. GUI apps are great and there's no shame in using them. Bad programmers can use the terminal for everything just the same as good ones can use mostly GUI tools. I think there's a small minority of programmers who just learned how to get around in the terminal and start bashing all other OSes because they're optimized for the mouse. That's just silly. The best choice is the one that you can most easily set up a dev environment in, supports the tools your workflow demands, and offers the features your personal preference dictates.

And it's not as easy as you'd think. Most of the imperial powers spent a <i>lot</i> of money on things like shipping people across oceans, maintaining vast military forces to guard their empires, building massive amounts of infrastructure in their empires, trying to convert the natives to Christianity or at least stop them from immolating themselves on their husbands' funeral pyres, teaching the natives to govern themselves, getting into wars with your colonists when they want to be an independent country, and getting into wars with the natives when they want to be an independent country. Adding insult to injury, having huge empires means a war with the neighboring European country turns into a huge world war between your colonies and the enemy's colonies. It gets so expensive that eventually you have to abandon your colonies--and it's not like India or Africa just ran out of natural resources. Quite the opposite, really.<p>So instead of messing around with all of that, China's expenses are limited to building infrastructure in China, maintaining vast military forces to guard China and occasionally menace Taiwan, and converting the Chinese to some vaguely secular state-approved worldview. And they have the benefit of modern technology and the entire developed world to crib notes from. They don't have to figure this shit out the first time. A factory anywhere in the West in the 19th century was a best guess--a Chinese factory today benefits from 200 years of experience and empirical research into how to run a factory, robots, computers, a huge foreign population of people buying stuff, and thousands of Western-educated professionals.

6648450,comment,6646195,6647500,8,0,markkanof,,,"I recently decided to stop talking about teaching kids to code, and actually do it. I don&#x27;t plan to quite my job as a developer to become a full time teacher, so instead I started an after school program. This was made a lot easier because my wife is a high school teacher. We started a technology club at her high school with the dual goals of showing kids really interesting things that can be done with technology as well as actually teaching them some coding skills.<p>We&#x27;ve only been running for a few weeks but we&#x27;ve got about ten kids showing up every week. So far I&#x27;ve shown them some demos of things like using Google maps in your own software, making your own maps with TileMill, browser based games with Crafty, and phone call and SMS stuff with Twilio. They seemed to respond positively to all the demos but were very excited about the Twilio demo. I&#x27;m not surprised, because I also thought the ability to type something into a text area in the browser and then receive a phone call with that text read to me, is pretty sweet!<p>Most recently we started doing some basic HTML. Pages, images, links, etc.  The kids were simultaneously making jokes about how simplistic it was (&quot;oh wow, text on a page&quot;) and super excited to be creating something (&quot;look I made it say something different&quot;, &quot;cool, let me try!&quot;).<p>So basically what I&#x27;m saying is that if you have the opportunity, stop just &quot;spreading the word about programming&quot; and actually work with some kids to teach them something. It&#x27;s only been a few weeks, but already it feels like very fulfilling work, and hopefully it will make a difference to expose these kids to the what&#x27;s possible for them to do earlier than they might otherwise encounter it.",1383242326

6648443,comment,6647761,6647761,43,0,peterjmag,,,"I successfully applied for a work visa here in Berlin, and I was blown away by how quick the process was, especially in contrast to the stories I hear about the same process in the US. From submitting all the paperwork to getting word that my application was approved, it took a grand total of <i>7 days</i>. I was expecting to wait at least a few weeks, but it seems that the new Blue Card legislation has really streamlined things.<p>For anyone considering working in Germany, I would definitely recommend looking into the Blue Card, which offers some advantages over the normal work permit:<p>- It&#x27;s initially valid for 4 years. For limited contracts, it&#x27;s valid for the length of the contract plus 3 months.<p>- After 36 months with a Blue Card, you can apply for permanent residency (as opposed to 5 years with the normal work permit). This is lowered to only 21 months if you can prove B1-level German proficiency.<p>- You can leave the EU for up to 12 months without losing your visa status (versus 6 months with the normal work permit).<p>- After 18 months, you&#x27;re free to live and work in any other EU country.<p>Further details:

As much as people might complain about immigrants coming in and then going on welfare, it just doesn&#x27;t happen with any frequency. Instead, we get immigrants who come here and start companies at twice the rate of natural born citizens.<p>Our labor laws also select for people who really want to work - at least compared to our European counterparts. I don&#x27;t mean to say that people who emigrate to Europe don&#x27;t want to work, but the perception that you have to work longer hours in the US certainly does weed out the people who are overly concerned about working too much.<p>As long as we continue to have people who want to come to the US, I can&#x27;t see why we&#x27;d want to make the process easier unless we can continue to keep these filters in place.",1383242224

Most of life is just showing up and having a positive attitude -- far more than what kinds of boots you&#x27;re wearing or how much you spent on your coat. Yes, like most people I&#x27;ll happily make spot judgments within about 5 seconds of seeing you. But those judgments are not based on fashion. They&#x27;re based on hygiene, facial expression (are you happy? That makes me happy), demeanor, and body language.<p>A much better social signal is elimination of dialect, as the author mentions. Every culture has a &quot;high&quot; language and several medium or low languages. So get rid of that deep southern dialect if you want to make a good impression. Costs nothing. Instead of spending a lot on an expensive suit, pick up something wearable at the local Goodwill store. Practice entering a room, walking, sitting down, and chatting in front of a video camera.<p>Social signalling is just the way we&#x27;re made. But it doesn&#x27;t have a damned thing to do with being poor. Or rather the signal in this case is easily gamed in very cheap ways. At least for purposes of getting out of poverty. Obviously, if you&#x27;re selling stocks, the game is played at a different level. But even then, there are lots of tactics that don&#x27;t involve writing big checks.<p>In short, don&#x27;t be a putz. Instead, cultivate inside of yourself something of real value, and make sure that the things that you have and do allow that to shine through.",1383241848

6648362,comment,6647809,6647809,23,0,ahelwer,,,"When debating social justice issues, it is wise to bear in mind that deconstructing one particular thesis in a vacuum offers little more than intellectual showboating; much of the social justice narrative describes small and seemingly-trivial barriers cumulatively forming concrete obstacles. For a better metaphor, Marilyn Frye writes in <i>The Politics of Reality</i>:<p>&quot;Cages. Consider a birdcage. If you look very closely at just one wire in the cage, you cannot see the other wires. If your conception of what is before you is determined by this myopic focus, you could look at that one wire, up and down the length of it, and be unable to see why a bird would not just fly around the wire any time it wanted to go somewhere. Furthermore, even if, one day at a time, you myopically inspected each wire, you still could not see why a bird would have trouble going past the wires to get anywhere. There is no physical property of any one wire, nothing that the closest scrutiny could discover, that will reveal how a bird could be inhibited or harmed by it except in the most accidental way. It is only when you step back, stop looking at the wires one by one, microscopically, and take a macroscopic view of the whole cage, that you can see why the bird does not go anywhere; and then you will see it in a moment. It will require no great subtlety of mental powers. It is perfectly obvious that the bird is surrounded by a network of systematically related barriers, no one of which would be the least hindrance to its flight, but which, by their relations to each other, are as confining as the solid walls of a dungeon.&quot;<p>This myopic focus seems to be more common on technology forums than elsewhere. I am interested as to why this is the case. Probably, a technical education lends itself well to analyzing the validity of individual details but not reasoning at a structural level.",1383241605

I don&#x27;t agree with the article, but I&#x27;m just sharing a story that seems on subject.<p>She had about $300 in her bank account, told me she was broke, and began selling off a few extras around the house. She ran her business from home and the holidays were coming up. I continued to work as usual, and ask what she&#x27;s up to. Well, she was closing up shop for 2 weeks, because hey, it&#x27;s the holidays, that means no work. I thought that was a little strange, you&#x27;re struggling to pay bills, and not paying your one or two employees on time, but refuse to pickup the phone to make a few sales during the break. Anyway, we decide to make dinner for the holidays, so we go shopping. She wants an elaborate dinner, so we spend $300 on groceries and alcohol for the two of us. This seems outrageous, but I figure we&#x27;ll have leftovers for a week, and I&#x27;m not broke, so I&#x27;ll toss in my half. Anyway, great dinner.

Well, that we contribute to the society that we&#x27;ve created... and that means spending money and buying into capitalism and this system of government we&#x27;re brainwashed into calling democracy - democrazy is more like it.<p>The thing that keeps capitalist economies functioning is spending money, when everyone stops spending money, it all falls to pieces. The entire U.S. economy depends on perpetual debt. If they teach money management to people in school, you run the risk that people stop living this lifestyle of perpetual debt and the economy would fail.<p>So it&#x27;s unlikely they&#x27;ll ever start teaching money management or lifestyle management, or anything that flies in the face of the status quo - at least, not in state subsidized schools, because they wouldn&#x27;t contribute to the continual cycle of craziness that is mandated by society.<p>The real world is that the rich rule the world and everyone else is groomed to fit into a society that will continue to maintain that status quo.

At the time I was struggling and would eventually end up temporarily homeless, and I didn&#x27;t have the clothes required to work at the store. The manager insisted I at least have 1 clean, all black outfit that was brand new. I went to H&M and did exactly what the author here describes, I skipped meals to afford it. I paid my share of the rent late, but I got the outfit and I started the job.<p>Given the opportunity, I started to excel and as we were paid commission, my financial outlook started to improve, but I was still in serious debt and couldn&#x27;t get enough hours to get over what seemed like an endlessly far away threshold of financial stability. Right before Christmas we had a regional manager come in and watch us work for a few days, as he was leaving he gave me ~$200 of &quot;KC Cash&quot; which was used to reward talented employees. I could use it, with my discount, to buy things we sold. I was so excited because it meant I&#x27;d be able to buy Christmas presents for my family.<p>Instead, my manager insisted I buy clothes and accessories for myself so I would be more presentable in the store. I went along with his demand and bought myself a couple outfits and a nice leather portfolio messenger bag, and gave my family nothing for the holidays, which they all understood.<p>In January, commissioned sales on moderately high end clothing drops off dramatically, as did my hours. Suddenly the threshold of stability vanished into the distance again and I needed to make a change. I wanted 40 hours, I had been without health insurance for a couple of years, and I wanted the chance to pay down my debts and move forward with my life. I started asking around and applying to office jobs for which I had no experience and no degree.<p>I landed an interview at a data processing company and I wore my Kenneth Cole clothes, I had a copy of my resume that a friend put together on their computer tucked into my KC Messenger bag. And when I was hired for a job I knew nothing about and had no prior experience with, it was from a pool of applicants who weren&#x27;t signaling their status as strongly as I was. I remember how confident I felt, sitting in their lobby with a dozen other people around me, none dressed as well, and the few who tried not having items of the same quality.<p>As I&#x27;ve developed more marketable skills (graphic design, web dev, etc.) I&#x27;ve been able to signal less, but the article struck a chord with me.

Similarly, as the old adage goes, there are lies, damn lies, and statistics. People will take advantage of the misperception of &quot;average&quot; and report a mean as &quot;the average&quot;, even though it hides the truth. For instance, around here people refer to the &quot;average&quot; income, some number like 50-60k, when the <i>median</i> income is actually around 40k.

This decision was made because it has been shown that in spite of guidelines endorsing prospective trial registration, trials are often not registered for many months after the initiation of participant enrollment. In some of these cases, the registration of the trial is performed in preparation for publication and after the decision is made to publish the results. To the extent that this occurs, the inclusion of trials with delayed registration would bias our results. We limited this source of bias by focusing on trials for which registration was not delayed.&quot;</i><p>I worry that the article is still examining a biased group. As it stands, over two thirds of the large trials (3710 out of 5427) were eliminated for registering after enrollment. It stands to reason, then, that this is standard industry practice. The remaining 10% that was studied is clearly bucking the common practice and I&#x27;d therefore suggest it&#x27;s not a representative sample.<p>That said, I commend them for the study and can&#x27;t suggest  a better way to mitigate bias.

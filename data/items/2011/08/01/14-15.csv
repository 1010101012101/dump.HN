We are actively looking for programmers, and I know many other companies in the area that are too. The ones I've talked to recently are looking for Ruby, Objective-C, and PHP, but I'm sure there are many, many more.<p>West Michigan is actually a fantastic place to be a programmer right now. We have dirt-cheap cost of living, beautiful scenery and a number of top-notch software companies working for major companies. (We count Fortune 100 & 500 Companies in our active client list.)<p>How do you get a job here?<p>1.) You could have emailed me. My email is on our website, and so are the heads of companies at our competitors. I have interviewed a number of people over the years even when we weren't hiring. I talk with our competitors frequently, so I know who's hiring and will gladly recommend people we can't hire.<p>Software companies are hiring. Ad agencies are hiring. Manufacturing & Medical companies are hiring. Nobody needs to leave Michigan to get a great job.<p>2.) Go to meetups.<p>Grand Rapids has a large number of great meetups and user groups for Ruby (<a href=""http://www.meetup.com/mi-ruby/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meetup.com/mi-ruby/</a>), Python (<a href=""http://www.meetup.com/grpython/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meetup.com/grpython/</a>), Linux (<a href=""http://grlug.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grlug.org/</a>), .NET (<a href=""http://wmdotnet.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wmdotnet.org/</a>) a new and huge Web Dev group (<a href=""http://grwebdev.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grwebdev.org/</a>), Software Craftsmanship (<a href=""http://softwaregr.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://softwaregr.org/</a>), and many more (<a href=""http://conga-wm.org/group-list/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://conga-wm.org/group-list/</a>). The annual BarCamp is in a few weeks (<a href=""http://barcampgr.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://barcampgr.org/</a>) and we even have Y-Combinator style seed accelerator, <a href=""http://momentum-mi.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://momentum-mi.com/</a>.<p>Go to any of these. Talk to people. You don't need to know ""contacts in the industry"" you need to meet people. They'll tell you who to talk to, where to apply, and how to brush up your skills.<p>3.) Write some code.<p>In the age of GitHub and SourceForge (who has coders in Grand Rapids and is often hiring <a href=""http://geek.net/about/careers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geek.net/about/careers/</a>) there's no excuse for not having code that you've written. Find some small project and make it better, or contribute documentation. Don't get discouraged if you can't find a project to hack on right away, you will. Blog about it. Talk about it.<p>Michigan, and especially West Michigan has some amazing programming shops, some of the best coders I've met anywhere, and everyone is hiring. I know many people have moved away, but there is no reason to anymore. This is a great state, a bit underrated, with an under-the-radar software scene that is ready to explode.<p>Anyone know Ruby and want to work for a Michigan company in a lakeshore town? Talk to me.",1312210593

Unlike the author, I am not fortunate enough to have Oracle, and am instead using MSSQL for our database with 500+ stored procedures. Here's my experience:<p>Even the first ""myth"" that was ""busted"" had me cringing, putting all the stored procedures into individual files and using a source control system to manage those. The person I replaced had done the same thing with 500+ stored procedures and still had never bothered to actually update the files. He just updated the stored procedures on the development server. Partly because he was a massive fuckup, but also because it was ""out of band"" management.<p>I ended up moving the code out of SourceAnywhere (an all around terrible version control system and company) and placing the code into Github, and cleaning up the database so that it could actually be dumped to an SQL file and then loaded from that file as an NUnit test, run by the CI server that I set up.<p>Even with these huge strides forward, it has taken me months to clean up and fix these problems, while still adding new features to the existing code and database. The experience has left me feeling that the low quality of code that crap coders can get away with in stored procedures, and the lack of testability still leads me to strongly avoid stored procedures because I ended up having to fix them with sweat, tears, and blood.",1312210159

In regard to entertainment, it'd be interesting to see a nomalized total $/hr comparison of various activities. For example, compare a standard movie in a theater to playing Dragon Age. That'd be roughly $15/hr (adding popcorn) vs. (120 hrs game play / ~60$ for the game) ~$.50/hr.

The startup that I was building was going all right business-wise, but constant, relentless pressure from the financier was ruining my life (I programmed, he paid and did sales).<p>I had a nervous breakdown and left the business. To pay the bills, I told everyone that I know that I was freelancing back in the world that I came from - building digital advertising sites. I was embarrassed, broken and burned out.<p>It was the best move that I ever made. I ended up only working for small startup web production companies. One of those companies loved my work and we got along famously. They ended up offering me an equity position in their company. I brought sales contacts into the business that were too big to work on my own. The result is a booming business. We're doing just awesome work that I never thought I would be doing.<p>While it sucked (and still sometimes sucks) to do project work, we're paying down some debt and planning to pivot our services company and potentially add a product to the mix.<p>I don't know if you can do exactly what I did but my point is that you need to chill, do awesome stuff for small companies and have faith that you're doing the right thing.

Languages have trends, there are ones that are currently the hottest ones that are starting to wain and others that are out of vogue. Take for example Java, at one time Java was the language to be seen developing in. Java developers where the rock stars, Java on top actually lasted for a long time, when compared to other languages but it's sun has set now, it is now in the none of the hip kids are doing it camp. Now onto Python, it was one of the first crop of languages to try to supplant Java from the cool kid spot. That crop had limited success and the only place that python saw wide adoption was coupled with Dijango for web. The thing is PHP and Drupal also achieved success in this era which split the, we are the new cool kid market. A second crop of new languages came up this time Ruby, Scala et. al. They where more focused on the problem domain they targeted and incorporated newer development constructs, they became the new cool kids. Now Python had become the OK kid but it's shine had worn off, Then came along the shift from server to clients for the UI and everyone started building out rich UI's with Javascript, then Javascript became the darling and server side JavaScript run-times where built, Java was now decidedly uncool and Python is now out of mind and Ruby's shine has worn off. In the end with Python it did not achieve the success of Java or COBAL to provide for lots of jobs even when it is no longer the cool kid and the unfortunate reality of languages that burn their star quick is that the cool kids move on, so there are very few stuck in the middle. Ruby may have enough to support them as their popularity wains, PHP definitely will, Python has some dedicated fans and the market may reach an equilibrium but as for now, you are seeing the product of a lot of developers trained in the last gen, while the projects have moved on to the next trend.",1312208383

For example, I might be able to increase convergence by changing the button text to ""buy now"" <i>and</i> changing the background color to black, but not each one independently. Conversely, changing the button text to ""buy now"" might <i>hurt</i> convergence if the background color is black, but improve convergence if the background color is white.<p>Essentially that means that if I make N changes at the same time and convergence changes, it's not possible to tell which combination of the changes affected convergence, and how (at least not without a new series of hypothesis tests to establish controls). Perhaps only one change made the difference and the rest were irrelevant, perhaps multiple changes made the difference, etc.<p>The bandit problem is much simpler because it guarantees that none of the variables depend on each other.

I wouldn't be shocked to learn that most Americans don't know anything about the man, Geronimo.<p>EDIT: Also, on Biden's comment about attending mass: that's just Biden being a good Catholic.

The policy of killing bin Laden is supported by many people who don't belong to a religion.  Bin Laden's attacks killed all sorts of different people.

Bold in that you will have to be brave enough to try something new:  You haven't been a Product Manager officially before, but your startup experience counts for a lot.   Humble in that you can't say that you know exactly how to do Product Management, but it is such a multi-disciplinary role that is different for each team that you might work with that it is a place where you can go, and learn more and more for the next 10 years in your career.<p>Of course, that said, I'm talking about Silicon Valley.

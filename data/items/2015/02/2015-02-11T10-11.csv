You need to start really early to be finished in time for late eaters to be able to fill the same table.<p>And much of the time in restaurants is actually spent waiting for the next course.

9032253,comment,9028866,9031344,0,0,lmm,,,"> Our feeling isn&#x27;t that Java is bad it&#x27;s that it shouldn&#x27;t be the only option for big data processing. There are a lot of people that want to do this type of computing and a lot of them hate Java.<p>JVM != Java. It runs a wide variety of languages, and this is not just theory - you can do Spark in Python right now. &quot;Every language I care about&quot; was perhaps overly flippant, but between Groovy, Clojure and Scala there&#x27;s something to suit most programming tastes.<p>Meanwhile I hate Linux, and Docker doesn&#x27;t have a good answer for that; the suggestions I&#x27;ve seen for developing with Docker on other platforms boil down to &quot;run Linux in a VM&quot;.<p>> Could you give an example of what could go wrong here? Docker prevents you from talking to the outside world so you can&#x27;t call out to an outside service in the middle of a job or anything like that.<p>I&#x27;m more worried about forward compatibility, standardization - and partly attack surface I guess. I can run jars from 15 years ago, on today&#x27;s JVM - and not because it bundles an old version; I can link today&#x27;s programs against 15-year-old libraries and they&#x27;ll just work. If a library I built against has disappeared from the internet, that&#x27;s fine.<p>Meanwhile I can&#x27;t run linux binaries from 15 years ago (I did try with some of the loki games - maybe it&#x27;s possible but it&#x27;s decidedly nontrivial). Even if I found the right .sos, if I wanted to use a library with the ABI of ten years ago in my program, I&#x27;d have to rebuild the whole world. I guess I&#x27;m meant to rebuild my docker image, but that doesn&#x27;t work if the library source is no longer available, and I&#x27;m not at all confident that the tooling does fully reproducible builds to the same extent as e.g. maven (from what I can see plenty of dockerfiles use unpinned versions).<p>Finally, the spec for the JVM is in one place, and it&#x27;s published; apache harmony shows that a ground-up reimplementation is possible (that the TCK isn&#x27;t open is very unfortunate, but the patents will expire sooner or later). I have a reasonable level of confidence that we&#x27;ll always be able to run the jars we&#x27;re producing today, without having to emulate x86s or what have you. Linux doesn&#x27;t have a spec like that (yes the C code is available), and I don&#x27;t think a ground-up reimplementation would be feasible.<p>> In Pachyderm job scheduling happens outside the user submitted containers. The job scheduler is what actually spins up the containers and pushes data through them. I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t understand what it would even mean for one of those containers to then do job scheduling itself.<p>Job scheduling was a poor example; I guess I&#x27;m thinking more things like e.g. running your own database on the cluster nodes, instead of talking to one outside the cluster via a proper interface. (Admittedly that&#x27;s possible on hadoop with derby or h2).<p>Thinking about it more I guess it&#x27;s less the service part and more the interface part that I&#x27;m worried about. A docker image could implement critical functionality with shell scripts. I bet they will. I&#x27;ve already spent too much of my life trying to get people to move away from shell scripts into something safer and more maintainable.",1423651923

9032248,comment,9029722,9030220,0,0,vidarh,,,"In a declining business, either you want to extract as much as possible before the market disappears, or you want to invest in turning the decline into growth.<p>Either can be valid answers. Consider a business that is in decline because the market it is serving is disappearing. In that case this guideline tells you that if you try to invest money into getting it back into growth, and you fail, then you should instead focus on minimizing cost and maximizing price to extract as much value as possible (to e.g. reinvest in another business).<p>Alternatively if you find investing more leads the growth rates to increase accordingly to keep matching this guideline, it indicates that you have untapped market potential that is worth exploiting in order to put you in a position to extract far higher earnings (in absolute terms) down the road.<p>You can reformulate it pretty much as: Invest in growth when growth is cheap, and extract profit when it is not.",1423651765

An indicative example is of course two persons, citizens A and B. Citizen A goes to work in manual labor after primary education. Citizen B goes to high school and then gets a university education. 
Citizen A may well be earning much more in his early 20&#x27;s than citizen B.<p>Depending on how long the studies take, citizen B has earned little money by the time he/she is 25, while citizen A who went straight to work, say in construction, has been accumulating earnings for many years.

9032212,comment,9031419,9031865,0,0,nly,,,"Theoretically if you had a kernel written in Rust, I suppose you could implement the system call interface such that all pointers passed to the kernel from user space would be considered &quot;borrowed&quot; under the Rust type system, and then have all your &quot;return to user space&quot; mechanisms recognised by the compiler as terminating their lifetime.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s enough though, considering that, in general, the kernel can&#x27;t assume anything passed to it by reference via a system call isn&#x27;t mutated by another userland thread. Furthermore, even if everything were written in Rust, the kernel can&#x27;t just <i>trust</i> that a userland process was actually compiled in a way that faithfully employed Rusts compile-time safety guarantees... so I think any notion of shared garbage collection is tricky without a program loader that did code verification.<p>Microsoft have done some work in this area with their Singularity and Midori projects[0]. Singularity in particular eliminates hardware isolation between processes.<p>I think the simple answer here is that the kernel should be <i>copying</i> anything passed to it by reference if it intends to do anything beyond a single atomic read operation. This is why, on Linux for instance, send() can&#x27;t return to user space until the data has been copied in to kernel controlled memory, and why we have nice things like splice() and sendfile() to deal with the performance hit of doing so for common cases.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midori_%28operating_system%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midori_%28operating_system%29</a>",1423650487

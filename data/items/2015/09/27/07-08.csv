And you have a much smaller engineering team, much faster growth, twice as many active users, and far fewer fail whales.<p>Regardless of the comparisons, 2,000 engineers seems excessive in proportion to Twitter&#x27;s product, which suggests engineering inefficiency.",1443340687

The main visible difference is that with a RSS feed you can retrieve older entries when you subscribe; it&#x27;s funny how people associate RSS with news when one of its key features is to let you fetch old news. TinyLetter, btw, appears to offer this feature by letting the author resend old letters to new subscribers.<p>An other difference is that one can reply to an email but not to a RSS feed. Reading the comments here it seems to me it is a key point relevant to TinyLetter versus Twittbook.<p>TinyLetter is a one-way communication channel. Like a blog with comments disabled. This is to me a major feature for two reasons that are actually one: spam. With comments gone you don&#x27;t have to deal with spam, trolls, etc. The second reason is &quot;social interaction spam&quot;: when feedback is enabled, people may think they have to reply, support, &quot;like&quot;, &quot;retweet&quot; etc. Often the reply is void of content.<p>TinyLetter&#x27;s key feature is that you are sending a &quot;newsletter&quot;, making it clear that <i>no feedback is required</i>, which eliminates the <i>social spam</i> that pervades social networks.",1443340541

The many rejections of real-time patches into the Linux kernel tree have shown that the kernel devs favor performance to precision, so it would be a fool&#x27;s errand to try once again to push a real-time patch just to get it patched. At which point, you&#x27;ll end up having to do a lot of your own OS development anyways to backport kernel features you need. There are quite a few situations where Linux will delay interrupts for milliseconds, and quite a few situations where milliseconds can mean millions of dollars.<p>For your last question, 20 years of support will certainly not Linux developers. While MS offers extended support for Windows XP, neither earth nor the heavens will make Red Hat provide extended support for RHEL 3.

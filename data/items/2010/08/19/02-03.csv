Some startups genuinely do provide a valuable service that people can't or won't pay for.

At $5EPM (that's probably high) for 20mm (low according to quantcast) that's $100k a month.  Remember that the ""awesome images from other sites"" is also an ad.  He also fires pixels to ad networks, like scorecardresearch.com and crowdscience.com to add a little extra ""ad-less"" earnings to the bottom line.<p>On his stats page he says bandwidth used in the past month was 165TB, which on S3 would cost $16,500 plus more for storage used, however I bet he's getting a good deal from Voxel.<p>Update: those may not be ad networks after all -- I'm not sure.

Do you really think that a horse is more efficient for labour than machinery?<p>In the past people used these inefficient methods because that was the best technology they had available.

STM has been shown to greatly benefit the <i>correctness</i> of concurrent programs, you're managing that less by hand. The only thing that seems to be unproven is whether the performance tradeoff is worth it. It'd be nice to see some numbers that show what you lose in X% of the performance vs removing X% the amount of locking code.<p><i>> [Java interop] And frankly it can get ugly.

But Wheeler seems to state it pretty plainly in this summary:<p>>  In the DDC technique, source code is compiled twice: once with a second (trusted) compiler (using the source code of the compiler’s parent), and then the compiler source code is compiled using the result of the first compilation. If the result is bit-for-bit identical with the untrusted executable, then the source code accurately represents the executable.<p>I&#x27;d speculate that you need at least one of the compilers to be trusted otherwise they could both be subverted to produce X, Y that would produce matching V, W binaries with the attack still in place on both.",1442494650

10233051,comment,10232483,10232483,0,0,oneJob,,,"Suggesting that a site agree to have either one or no ads seems a bit to comand-and-control for the Internet.<p>I agree with the other commenter that it seems reasonable for asightto a sight to block content if their ads are blocked, but do not see this as a sustainable solution. How can one know abead of time whether a site will or will not behave this way. The only time you&#x27;d know is if re-visiting. In that case, you&#x27;re not likely to revisit. Seems like a lose-lose.<p>To me, the obvious answer is the option to opt out and either immediately paying a metered amount cash exchange, paying an end of month pro-rata subscription amount, or paying via a block exchange.<p>I think the end of month subscription, divied pro-rata, is the best option (anonymized of course). Its transaction cost is the middle of the two. It requires no direct relationship with the site prior to your visit. But most importantly, it allows for Spotify style consumer pricing. The consumer pays a flat fee for opting out of adverts. Then the content creators are encouraged to produce content that you will actually spend time with, not click-bait. This leaves the option on the table for each site to sell other content and material behind pay walls.<p>One last comment. Advertising is designed to influence and change behavior and opinions. In my opinion it is disingenuous to insist that a site visitor agrees to third party influence brokering to keep your lights on. It is my screen, my hardware, and my mind. I have every right to run adblocker. Similarly you have every right to decide bow to keep the lights on at your business. But I think there as been enough of this argument that consumers have unwittingly entered into some sort of relationship /agreement and should somehow wake-up and see that it&#x27;s our proper responsibility to be good advert targets so the servers stay on.",1442494628

10233045,comment,10231967,10232831,0,0,jwdunne,,,"I think that is quite a negative response to a benign comment. Your response sums up why I don&#x27;t share it often - I simply do not wish to preach.<p>I also think you have assumed a bit too much about me and how I treat other people. I said I don&#x27;t share it. That does not mean I have tried and failed. I have shared my experiences with close family members. I have never preached and never will.<p>The emotional connection and understanding connected to these ideas are exactly what makes them important. To dismiss emotional insights as unimportant is to make emotion a second-class citizen in a world that is actually driven in a big way by emotion.<p>For example, the phrase &quot;the dog is running across the main road&quot; is a trivial fact when you see a dog run across a main road. If you&#x27;re the owner, the emotions are what differentiate it from mere triviality. For the owner, the panic of their dog running across a road off leash is not emotionally trivial.<p>Back to my comment, I merely stated that the emotional value of these ideas is hard to convey without such experiences.<p>I&#x27;d beg to differ about the abilities enabled by my experiences. For one, I can relate to them ok an emotional level, which I cannot have done before. Second, it is clear to me that this particular journey has encouraged exploration and insight into my thoughts and emotions on a deep level. Before hand, I would not have bothered.<p>Could I have achieved this with a different set of experiences? It&#x27;s probably. Does that discount the emotional value of those experiences to me? No.<p>What you are doing is trying to discount the emotional value I place on my own experiences, which is all I have talked about plus the difficulty of discussing the emotional insights from my experiences with those who haven&#x27;t had them. There isn&#x27;t really anything to object there.",1442494564

10233027,comment,10232483,10232483,0,0,neya,,,"Back in the early internet era, the best content was available for free of charge. If anything, that&#x27;s still the case even today. Try to google on some technical topics like Ohm&#x27;s law or something and you&#x27;ll find very old websites built with good ole&#x27; HTML tables providing the information you need crisp and clear.<p>Actually, I disagree. This is 2015. If I want to start a website on a certain topic, say about cars or electronics, I can find some really good free hosts who will support me without any sneazy catches. As a real example, I go to blogger.com, setup a new blog with my own custom theme, (with all the attribution to blogger removed if I want to) and start producing content. Not cool with blogspot? Then, how about Github pages? Not so technical? How about using a free shared web host (there are plenty, Google them)?<p>If your objective is to spread information and knowledge, you will do that no matter what. It is when your objective is guised as spreading information when you really want to make money and scale up doing so, then you run into a problem. The problem with this kind of appeal against ad-blocking is the same old argument of &quot;How much is too much?&quot;<p>&quot;We need money to support our website to keep it up and running&quot;. But, never do these authors disclose how much they really need as long as they&#x27;re making a killer profit.<p>The problem with mixing ads with content is that introduces a conflict of interest - Are you writing that content because you like writing, or are you writing that content to get more eyeballs to serve your advertisers? And it&#x27;s very hard to convince your readers that you don&#x27;t intend to make money from them although you have ads on your site.<p>For your reference, I do own a blog myself without any ads whatsoever and I think this is the future we&#x27;re heading towards. I am a proud user of adblock software and I refused to be shamed for that. As would any user, I am concerned about the content first, which is the logical reason why I go to a site. But, if the site tries hard to ruin my experience to make it difficult for me to consume that content, then of course, I&#x27;ll find a way to circumvent it. But, that doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t support the authors of the site, just that as everyone else, I have my own way of supporting them. Just like how I&#x27;ve been donating to Wikipedia all these years.<p>There have been too many sites abusing the slogan of &quot;We need to place ads so we can support ads&quot; to buy back our lost trust. Sure, there will be a lot of content weeded out because they can&#x27;t support themselves, but I am confident that the ones whose objectives are to spread information will do so no matter what.<p>We built the internet ourselves when no one gave us ads to support our efforts back then. And we&#x27;ll find a way to do it again. Just takes time and patience.",1442494236

I just want to add this:<p>I&#x27;ve travelled to this country (GDP per capita ~$1500) and stayed with this <i>huge</i> family. In the city I stayed in, there was one suburb where every house was part of the same family with the same last name. There must have been 500 to 1000 members, who knows. Inside one family there were policemen, shopkeepers, maids, factory owners, factory workers, businessmen, and family members with connections to mobsters (I couldn&#x27;t pin down the mobsters and politicians among them exactly). In this country family <i>is</i> life. All members of the family <i>generally</i> love and respect everyone else in the same family. Their family ties are a lot strong than ties they make at their &quot;work&quot;. The first thing we did when I arrived to stay with the family was to meet the mobster of the city so as to protect me from everyone else. One of the mobster&#x27;s primary function was to act as a middleman for paying &quot;fees&quot; to the right politician to get bureaucratic matters resolved efficiently. (e.g. getting a visa in a few days instead of a month or two without &quot;fee&quot;. In a way, they are lobbyists the common people can afford). The family ties cut across economic, social, and political boundaries. The fact that mobsters thrive there means they are part of the stable equilibrium. It wouldn&#x27;t be possible to say &quot;Let&#x27;s get rid of the mobsters&quot; - that&#x27;s like saying &quot;Let&#x27;s get rid of the lobbyists from the US.&quot;.

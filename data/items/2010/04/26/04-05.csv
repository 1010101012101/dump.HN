1294145,comment,1293918,1293918,0,0,elblanco,,,"Early on in my career, I learned a lesson from a retiring colleague -- a former Army Colonel, ""never be loyal to a company because the company won't be loyal to you."" You can be loyal to individuals, and people can be loyal to you. But the company? Nah. Lots of people get burnt really early in their careers thinking that showing intense loyalty to an organization will be rewarded when no such thing happens -- an ""organization"" doesn't care. At best, your boss might give you a bump if you are loyal to him/her, and that kind of thing pays off in the long run, in terms of keeping well built bridges (it's amazing how often you meet the same people in a given industry no matter how big).<p>The reason I'm commenting about this?<p>> They’re not in the office? You wait a few days until they are. They new job can’t way? Bullshit. Or, if true, it’s a good sign that it’s an organization you don’t want to work for because they don’t care about you.<p>This is the kind of idealistic naiveté, that while nice in principle, doesn't really matter in reality. Show up, do a good job, when the time is right, move on. If you boss isn't there, call them. If they aren't making themselves available to the employees, then I suppose they fall into the category of ""places that don't care about you"" anyways.<p>Organizations, by definition never care about you and you shouldn't care about them. Care about your work and doing a good job -- that builds self-respect and your reputation. Ask for what you want when you want it and be patient until you get it, don't be a baby or an asshole, be flexible when better ideas than yours come along, that builds respect. Business isn't about feelings, it's about <i>production</i> and making more money than you lay out. If you want feelings, wait 'till quitting time and the after-work meetup at the local happy hour where everybody can commiserate all they want over $3 beers.<p>Think your company cares about you because of the free t-shirts, catered food and free drinks? Are you kidding me? They just know they can squeeze and extra 2-3 hours a day out of your sorry ass at pretty much no extra pay and about $10-15/day.<p>Other than that, the post is pretty spot on.",1272257809

But that has nothing to do with whether oil is fungible.<p>Fungibility means that it makes no difference if Saudi Arabia decides they won't sell to us and instead sells the 100B barrels/day that they would have sold to us (made up number) to China, and because of that, China buys 100B fewer barrels/day from Canada, who sells that 100B to us instead.",1272256738

If you were making the ideal / online faxing startup, what would you do?<p>2. A different business model?\n-The standard model is users pay a monthly X dollars for Y faxes, usually around $10 for 400 faxes.  But, these players lose out on lower volume customers who don't want to pay monthly rates\n-Skype-style pre-charge with the option of a monthly rate for those who want a unique fax number.  20 cents a page. But, if a user spends $10 in one month, we give him/her a few hundred free pages for that month.\n-What do you think?<p>3. What features would it take to get you or people you know to use it? \n-We're thinking about different ""killer features"" we could use to pull people in.<p>If you want to test hellofax, it comes with 3 pages automatically. But, ping me at joseph@hellofax.com and I'll give you more credit.<p>I really, really appreciate feedback.  Thanks for reading.",1272254962

You have to make sure that the magic becomes a permanent asset, or you are going to get knocked back to the starting line when mr wizard leaves or when it's time to grow the team.<p>How to do this depends on the particular kind of work being done, but generally speaking you want maintainable code with lots of tests, and records of the valuable knowledge gained in the process.<p>It's not easy to get this out of most developers, particularly if you are not a developer yourself.

That way they are demonstrating their knowledge rather than claiming it.<p>Like if you wanted to find out if people know that bacon flavour crisps are vegetarian you'd ask something like ""do any crisps contain meat or animal products?"" and be prepared with follow on questions. So if the response is ""no"" you go back with ""not even BBQ beef or bacon flavour?"". If they answer ""yes"" you ask ""out of these, which are suitable for vegetarians: ..."" or somesuch.",1272254635

My current solution is to just get off EC2 and run the crawler locally.<p>I have a DHT-layer ping utility, and observed that the failing node could not ping some peers that the successful node (crawling the other network) could, so I hypothesize that either EC2 or the file-sharing network was doing some rate limiting. The puzzling thing is that the local scanner has been running for hours without showing any signs of failure.",1272254600

Stealing a page from dropbox and similar services, Apple should just make a basic MobileMe account free and let you buy additional services as needed.  The service is already integrated into the desktop OS, it is partially integrated into the iPhone OS, and if they just added some polish and back-end resources they would have a decent start towards cutting off Google encroachment into their platform.",1272254429

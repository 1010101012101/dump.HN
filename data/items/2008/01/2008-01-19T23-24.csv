I remember the post you are talking about though. Supposedly he used a Bayesian filter on real time Google searches to predict two gas station bombings in Baghdad. It's a shame that story didn't get front paged, it was kind of interesting even if it was made up.<p>It's really weird though going back and reading my conversations with him on K5. I'm sure a lot of people here probably knew him though; it would be almost impossible not to have had a conversation with him if you were a regular social news user circa 2000. The guy posted constantly on Slashdot, K5, Joel on Software, Usenet, etc.",1200783790

The mpeg vs ogg kerfuffle is irrefutable proof that consumers are hurt when a patent is the basis of a standard. In domains where a standard is necessary, no patents should be granted. The economic incentive to innovate is still there because the common parts all people to be part of a larger ecosystem of devices, which is essentially a market to profit from.",1342893521

They're expecting improvements in cash flow in other, non-competing products, which they can realize but which the original product will never see.  Big players will ""overpay"" for something of strategic importance.<p>So if the hope is that buying small products will free you from the big players, yeah, that was always dubious, at least in the  corners interesting to those players.<p>On the other hand, Sparrow got built, didn't it?  And whatever you liked about it just got a big fat Market Stamp Of Approval.  It wouldn't be surprising for similar features to start appearing in other mail clients, some of them open source.  Maybe someone will build Sparrow The Sequel (""Google didn't get every egg in the nest . . ."").  VCs just got more interested in pitches for email software.<p>How much this matters depend on what you want.  If you want freedom from ""you are the product"", the complaint makes more sense to me.  But if what you want is more innovation, well, Sparrow's DNA just demonstrated its ability to generate returns.  And returns on innovation more generally have been validated.  So it isn't clear to me that buying Sparrow ""failed"" to push innovation forward.",1342893473

BUT many cameras of the day were not motor or spring driven, but run by a hand crank.  The cameraman would hum a popular tune at the right tempo and try to turn the crank in time with the beats of the music.  This meant that there are subtle faster and slower moments.  Also, I noticed a couple of tiny jump cuts where a frame or two may have been lost in the original, also munching with the motion.

Yes, getting organized and focusing on a problem is a good start but the article is talking about a way to get creative ideas when facing hard problems.  Specifically, the idea is <i>not</i> to focus on a problem directly.  It is sort of a lateral thinking strategy where instead of attacking the problem by banging down the front door, you instead try to find a side entrance.  Last week, I was working on a very tough puzzle and trying to attack it directly with just pure concentration wasn't working.  I just kept getting into a loop and couldn't make any further progress.  The solution didn't come until the next day after I had stopped thinking about the problem and involved a very different strategy.

4275179,comment,4275154,4275154,11,0,_delirium,,,"I'd argue this is already to <i>some</i> extent culturally accepted, but mostly only in an ""arts"" context, and not generally in any formal discussion like medicine. But in general culture, people often do seem to view, e.g., the alcoholism of the absinthe-cafes era, or the drugs of the Beatniks, or the LSD of the 60s-70s, as a type of personality and lifestyle that may, in some cases, be at least worth respecting if not imitating. Mostly relates to the arts, although there are a handful of other examples, such as Paul Erds's well-known amphetamines usage.<p>It seems like it does need a ""why this helps me be productive"" hook to convince people it has an upside. Either you need to be an artist and go for a ""helps my creativity"" angle, or else you need to be in some kind of focus-needing occupation and use drugs you argue improve your focus (amphetamines, off-label usage of Ritalin, etc.). Although, oddly, steroids for athletes don't get the same cultural free pass there.<p>I think people probably will find any concept along these lines more threatening than neurodiversity (possibly for good reason). People ""wired differently"" often grew up that way, so there's a sense in which you accept that's who the person is, and both they and others have gotten used to them being that person (in some cases). Most such groups are also a smallish percentage of the population, and you can't really ""opt into"" it on purpose, so it's a fairly fixed set. Parents aren't worried that their non-autistic teenager will one day decide to ""experiment with autism"", so there's less need to stigmatize it as an option. But nearly anybody can choose to become addicted to heroin, and a significant percentage of people who do, might decide it was a mistake, yet find it hard to get back out of the addiction. So it's a more ""dangerous"" concept in a sense, because anybody can opt into it, but possibly not opt back out.",1342890141

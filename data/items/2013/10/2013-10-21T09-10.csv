What the for command does in Python is essentially running two communicating coroutines, passing control between them. Yield-using generators actually make it very explicit, by creating special resumable stack frames. The only difference is that in Go, you&#x27;re not limited to a single stack frame in the producer, nor do you have to use a loop or the new PEP-380 &quot;yield from&quot; syntax (for example, if you&#x27;re iterating over a tree). The blocking channel takes care of the execution sequencing. (Also, in Go, the channel makes it possible for the consumer to use multiple stack frames, if you&#x27;re re-building another data structure instead with the data you receive from the producer, but that seems to be a rarer case. It&#x27;s a nice symmetry, though.)",1382348489

Of course nearly every Google App will break if you disable it, since every Google App is proprietary and Google&#x27;s Play Services is their common framework.<p>The question is - do third-party apps break if you disable Google Play Services? And the answer is that it depends. If the app needs Google&#x27;s services then it will stop working. However, making Play Services open-source, at least for the functionality provided right now, wouldn&#x27;t do any good. Because those services rely on Google&#x27;s server-side infrastructure, so you&#x27;re still at their mercy.<p>The only thing that bothers me is the Wifi-based location tracking. Google collects info about nearby Wifi networks and so the phone is able to give a pretty good estimate of latitude/longitude coordinates, even without turning the GPS on. Turning Google Play Services off means that Wifi-based location tracking stops working. And this is a pain, given that many apps these days (Facebook, Twitter) want to get your current city and so Facebook for example is accessing my GPS every time I open the app, with no way to turn this functionality off and it&#x27;s consuming my battery and the GPS status notifier is annoying.

You&#x27;re warned!!!!<p>Very sadly, he is completely wrong.<p>This is the beginning:<p>&quot;How Much Surveillance Can Democracy Withstand?<p>The current level of general surveillance in society is incompatible with human rights. To recover our freedom and restore democracy, we must reduce surveillance to the point where it is possible for whistleblowers of all kinds to talk with journalists without being spotted. To do this reliably, we must reduce the surveillance capacity of the systems we use.&quot;<p>Not true. Not even slightly true. Its so tragic.<p>In principle, I could not agree with him more, but that does not appear to be a reality the vast majority can be bothered with.<p>Why? The vast majority simply do not care. Worse still a huge chunk of society, on a daily basis, give up more personal information than any government can possibly hope to ask for. We in the UK groan when the census comes up, every 10 years. But the average facebook profile contains more personal information than any census has ever asked for. And many many people up date FB <i>daily</i>. Imagine a government asked us to document our lives daily? I could go on, but that&#x27;s the general thrust.<p>So, how much surveillance can society withstand? Loads more.<p>Is it incompatible with human rights? Well, humans don&#x27;t seem over bothered, in fact they offer up more information that the government could ever ask for. Hence the NSA/GCHQ slurping.<p>Because the government will only ever use the data in a small targeted way, it will never ever negatively effect the vast majority of people. So they will never be inconvenienced by it. Only &quot;those&quot; people will be effected, and &quot;they&quot; are guilty evil doers. So, there will never be an uprising or revolt, because most people are unaffected.<p>See, even people most out raged by this agree that its good if they can round up terrorists, pedophiles or who ever the current bogyman is. Well, while we accept that, we accept the method, and there for that &quot;evil&quot; must exist. When it exists, it can be easily and silently abused. The expectations are the gaps through which evil seeps. This is why we are or try to be absolute about torture, chemical or biological weapons, racism, and so on. We know if we allow it in any way, mission creep will happen.<p>Of course, the real hypocrisy of people is that when something bad happens, we blame government for not having enough control over circumstances. We immediately say, &quot;why didn&#x27;t they do this that or the other. They failed.&quot;  What if all this slurping of data could have prevented 9/11?<p>But in the end, from what I have seen, society can easily with stand a hell of a lot more surveillance. We allow it, government moderates it&#x27;s use such that most never see the down side, government loves control, and we expect government to have that control.<p>Truth is, really, people want more surveillance so that they can live nice risk free lives. Frankly, I&#x27;m not sure people really want real freedom at all. They want a freedom, or their freedom, one that suits their daily lives. But are only too happy to deny freedom to others as long as their freedoms are preserved.<p>If this slurping is really that evil and unacceptable, incompatibly with human rights, why haven&#x27;t millions of people descended on Washington and London, rioting in the streets, bringing down our respective governments?<p>Or are all these out raged people trusting democracy and the ballot box will sort it out?<p>Or, is it that really they don&#x27;t care?",1382346674

6584272,comment,6584045,6584045,3,0,jzet,,,"I did my masters degree in Stockholm and one thing I think is very important to know is that it is very difficult to find a job without speaking proper Swedish, so if you go to Sweden and at some point decide to change jobs, it might be difficult if you didn&#x27;t learn Swedish yet. 
I was in a CS masters program with about 30 other international students and none of us even got a IT related side job (not even at the international companies like IBM, ...) although Kista as part of Stockholm likes to be called &quot;the IT capital of europe ...&quot;.<p>Besides that, I really wouldn&#x27;t worry about crime etc. 
Swedes definitely have a different perception to crime and danger in general compared to the rest of the world I&#x27;d say, simply because Sweden is so peaceful.<p>I lived in Husby, which is considered &quot;ghetto&quot; by Swedes and the riots this year happened pretty much in front of my door. I didn&#x27;t even notice anything and was never scared to walk home at night, but every Swede I talked to reacted pretty shocked when I told them where I lived. 
So I really wouldn&#x27;t worry about that, especially if you got along in Moscow.",1382346293

6584264,comment,6583395,6583395,4,0,cokernel_hacker,,,"Neat. My reading of these changes imply that they finally made the L2ARC&#x27;s info survive a reboot.<p>For some background:<p>ZFS, a modern WAFL clone [1], has a replacement algorithm called ARC [2] which can concisely be described as a hybridized MRU/MFU (Most Recently Used/Most Frequently Used) replacement algorithm to decide which pages make the most sense for keeping in memory.  There is considerable literature surrounding replacement algorithm design, I have little to say about ARC other than it is patented [3] and can be outperformed by newer algorithms.<p>Note that this is quite different from the traditional approach of FS/buffer-cache design.  One usually expects the OS kernel to manage the buffer-cache for you (OS X has it&#x27;s Unified Buffer Cache (UBC), NT has it&#x27;s Cache Manager (Cc), etc.).  However ZFS includes it&#x27;s own incredibly complex caching subsystem around.  I do not know why they didn&#x27;t want to improve or modify the Solaris kernel&#x27;s segmap subsystem but there are consequences to this design. Notably, ZFS&#x27;s memory usage is quite a bit higher because of ARC.<p>The idea of performing read-caching in memory with ARC seemed like such a good idea to the ZFS designers that they allow for a second level of ARC to take place: L2ARC.  L2ARC essentially runs the ARC algorithm between SSDs and HDDs to, hopefully, speed up the performance of random reads in a ZFS storage pool.<p>Now to steer back towards what this code dump seems to be about. If you recall from before, ZFS&#x27;s ARC is a replacement algorithm based on <i>usage</i> and it needs to know which things to put where. This so-called persistent L2ARC remembers where things were on a L2ARC device so that the storage pool can take advantage of the fact that data is on the SSD on, say, a reboot.<p>Huh? Why did this require extra code? Remember, ARC was about caching: it didn&#x27;t need to remember anything. When coming back online, complicated things happen: transactions get replayed, metadata integrity needs to be rechecked, etc.  Implementing a persistent cache that is crash safe is incredibly difficult but not uncommon: auto-tiering [4] solutions like Fusion Drive [5] have to provide this kind of safety.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_Anywhere_File_Layout"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_Anywhere_File_Layout</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_replacement_cache"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_replacement_cache</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=6996676"" rel=""nofollow"">http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=6996...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Tiered_Storage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Tiered_Storage</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_Drive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_Drive</a>",1382346167

In the chapter on RMS, he mentioned that RMS didn&#x27;t use passwords and didn&#x27;t believe in security.<p>I found the dialup number to the MIT media lab, and tried logging in as &#x27;RMS&#x27; and viola, no password, and I had my first shell account on an internet-connected Unix machine, although I was only a teenager, and didn&#x27;t attend MIT.<p>RMS&#x27;s act of charity benefited me greatly, I was relatively poor growing up in inner city Baltimore, and his account was a life line to a new world of the internet and away from the crackhouse infested streets.<p>I find it interesting that he has changed his standpoint from one of radical transparency to techno-privacy.<p>Remember, RMS is the guy who hacked LCS&#x27;s computer lab password file, decrypted all the passwords, and emailed everyone suggesting they change their password to empty string. Now, I get that what he really wanted was to allow anyone to have access to LCS resources, and that would have been better served by just allowing anyone to create an account. But some early GNU accounts nevertheless did not have passwords, and I could read their email, shell histories, etc.<p>I think there is an interesting question is to the extremes of privacy and transparency in a democracy. If for example, it was not possible to discriminate against people, and if the government could not abuse any information gained on someone, then it might be the case that society would better off if there was very little privacy, because private distributed abuse amongst non-state actors would then be the biggest danger. If on the other hand, the state is far more abusive, then the fraud and violence perpetrated by small actors uncaught by surveillance is dwarfed by the damage done by the state having this information.<p>The question is, is it black and white, or is there some level of justifiable dragnet surveillance?

As unfortunate situation as it is with high school being a big popularity contest, if you acknowledge it and work hard on social skills, you can succeed. Just have to spend time on sports and socializing, and not 100% behind the computer.

Yee Lee appears to be just another employee and the executives alluded to were at least in large part, fairly recent hires; and none of them were founders or early employees - any of those who were eligible would almost certainly have cashed out in 2005 when eBay bought the company (and potentially cashed out again when Silverlake purchased from eBay).<p>[<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2693496"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2693496</a>]<p>[<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2672786"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2672786</a>]<p>I would suspect that most employees who stick it out through the acquisition are looking forward to the differences of workplace environment which will come with the transition from a private equity culture to Microsoft's corporate culture.<p>This story seems to have traction on two fronts, both as a Microsoft bashing peace and as a cautionary startup tale neither of which is accurate: it is unreasonable to imply that they could (let alone should) have made Skype's existing employee stock purchase agreements a point of negotiation. Likewise, Skype is not a startup. It's the Jeep of the digital age - Skype has been little more than an asset within a portfolio since 2005's purchase by eBay.",1309020384

2695995,comment,2695684,2695684,13,0,magicseth,,,"Recently, in the tech and geek community, I've noticed a backlash towards magic. I understand it in the contexts of the rejection of blind faith and superstition, but I think it fails to recognize the larger scope of the word magic.<p>I did a cross-cultural developmental psychology experiment on the way children think about magic. In brief, children in the USA showed an inverse correlation between their ability to understand something and their attribution of magic (i.e. if they didn't know how something worked, it was magic, and vice versa).  In Mexico, I found that the correlation was not so mutually exclusive, children were willing to attribute things to magic, even if they knew how it worked.<p>Understanding magic not as something distinct from science, but as something that is the realm of things which you can explore to understand better is, in my opinion, a better way to frame the debate.  Telling someone to stop believing in magic because no such thing exists is unlikely to change their belief system.  Encouraging them to explore magic, and seek to understand it and find the magic in everything around them, has a greater chance of spurring them into a more inquisitive frame of mind.<p>The theory of Wonder I developed for my masters thesis posits that wonder is an emotional trigger that positively rewards us for finding things that we can't explain.  The evolutionary basis for this is that the more things you find that break your world view, the more likely you will learn something to new that will positively effect your ability to survive.  This could explain people's fascination with magic: we have an innate drive to find the things that baffle us, an internal reward system for experiencing wonder.<p>I could go on about this for days, so I'll just stop now.",1309020344

Compared to skype, the experience is horrible. The audio and video quality is sensibly worse, the number of random disconnections and video freezes is pretty high. After a few minutes there is a noticeable lag in the voice connection, which gets higher with time. The general audio quality is worse then I remember having with ""Speak Freely"" back in the 90s, while I used a dial up modem. The Firefox plugin randomly refuses to work, and returns also random numeric error codes. Skype had, in my experience, none of these issues. Everything ""just worked"". Google is far, far away from that.

There was a Fortune 100 company I was consulting at and they had more ""important"" LOB apps than they had employees.  And this was a big company.  The sheer amount of code they had internally would dwarf the amount of code that MS ships.<p>They build this code against a given browser (although a lot of it isn't browser based, but for the sake of this discussion).  They can't just take a new browser and break half (or even 10%) of their apps.  At the same time, it will take a year or two to get their apps all working.<p>And these transitions do happen, but they're multiyear affairs.

2695970,comment,2694635,2695673,3,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"The answer is dirty:  First, computing is relatively new.  So, the 'old power structure' was surprised when people in computing started getting paid well enough to buy a house and more than some not very well paid low level managers.<p>But the start of this was not computing but math, physical science, and engineering during the sudden high demands in such fields in the 1960s due to both the Cold War and the Space Race.  There, too, the old power structure was surprised and angry.  Technical people were called 'The New Mandarins'.  The old power structure, say, Ivy League history majors, were torqued.<p>Part of the situation is somewhat general:  The 'suits' still want to be like in a Ford plant, say, 80 years ago when the suits knew more and the subordinates were there just to add labor, muscle, and sweat to the work of the suits.  Then in the technical fields, suddenly the subordinates knew more than the suits, e.g., about Maxwell's equations for battlefield or satellite communications, about the fast Fourier transform and digital filtering, about orbit determination for navigation satellites, and about computers.<p>Yes, people in law and medicine also know more, but they are in recognized professions set apart from the hierarchy of an old Ford plant, but computing was not, was, say, in the CFO's group or the manufacturing group.  Bummer.<p>So, some suit had a bright idea, ""To keep people from wasting so much time learning higher level languages, we will use only assembler and, thus, save lots of money."".  Right!  ""Also, programmers get paid much more than typists.  So, we will hire typists for the typing and won't let programmers type."".  With the ROFL, soon the suits saw that they were in deep, fuming, smelly, sticky stuff.<p>So, how can a suit survive?  Sure:  For each technical job, hire about three technical people.  Then none of the technical people can have 'leverage' over the suit.  Of course, for this, need MANY more technical people.<p>Second, the US DoD actually believed that for national security, the US should increase the supply of labor in technical fields and got Congress to agree.  Then the NSF started throwing money around to this end and with considerable success.<p>By the 1970s, US citizens began to see that there was no pot of gold at the end of the picture of a rainbow drawn by the NSF and heavily quit going for those technical fields.<p>Third, but the NSF kept trying.  Their next semi-bright idea was to write into academic research grant contracts that students must be supported.  When US citizens wouldn't come, the universities got the students from other countries, at first, heavily Taiwan and India.<p>Fourth, when the computer industry caught wind of all this, they pushed for the H1-B visa program and got a big supply of essentially 'indentured labor' they could, and did, exploit.<p>Net, fields such as law, medicine, pharmacy, roofing, carpentry, pizza making, machine tool making, auto repair, accounting, etc. don't get the attention from all of the DoD, big employers, Congress, the NSF, and the universities.<p>So, net, computing is heavily 'targeted' by all of the DoD, ..., the universities.<p>E.g,, the targeting pushes for more in, say, electronic engineering.  Thus, often there is a better career as an electrician than with a Ph.D. in electronic engineering:<p>At least in some states, the electrician needs a license and, likely, has liability, and the Ph.D. nearly never has either.  So, the electrician is closer to having a 'profession'.<p>As an employee in industry, the Ph.D. will likely discover that before 40 he has to move into management or get fired.  Yes, Virginia, they fire Ph.D. EEs.  So, by age 40, only about 1 in 100 is in management.<p>Fired, the Ph.D. will discover that the electrician of the same age can have a nice business, several employees, a nice house, and take off Friday-Sunday, even if he doesn't bother to have his name in the Yellow Pages, really can't be fired, and isn't vulneable to age discrimination, office politics, industry M&A, Toshiba beating GE, etc.<p>Really, more generally, with 'globalization', the US citizens who get rich are okay but most of the others need a geographical barrier to entry.  E.g., an electrician is not in competition with anyone more than, say, 100 miles away.  So, if he does okay in a radius of 100 miles, then he can do okay.<p>In business, the Ph.D. hss only a very narrow list of candidate employers, heavily the US 'military-industrial complex', while the electrician has a huge range of candidate clients and can do okay as long as the whole economy is not in the tank.  E.g., if there is new construction, then he does that.  If not, then he does renovations.<p>Seeing such things, many US citizens are avoiding the fields targeted by the Federal government and, also, fields vulnerable to globalization.  Net, at present, for nearly everyone in high school now, they better plan on a career as a Main Street sole proprietor.<p>Thank you NSF for 'targeting' technical fields and driving out US citizens and Foggy Bottom for 'globalization' as a source economic carrots to try to make nasty foreign countries 'behave' -- e.g,, give away much of the US bath towel market to Pukistan to make them 'behave'.  How well are they 'behaving'?<p>Mo big gumment, Ma!<p>The less big gumment does, the fewer really big mistakes they make.<p>But the flip side of this disaster is an historic opportunity and right in the center of HN:  Be an entrepreneur much as for a Main Street business but also technical.  Maybe get venture funding and maybe not, but in any event be a technical CEO.  Then can beat the pants off any competitors run by non-technical suits.",1309019457

Basically, the social hierarchy at a school promotes the social status of people that (a) are older or part of the educational bureaucracy, (b) demonstrate superficial interest in manufactured culture, (c) belong to mainstream cliques with lowest common denominator values, and most of all (d) are non-disruptive and therefore willing to follow the rules and authorities of the institution. This is as opposed to later life where in a less rigid social structure freethinkers move ahead from others depending on their ability to be (e) disruptive and on their human merit: (f) intellectual and (g) social.<p>It should be quite clear that, while a school may attempt to educate pupils which it often achieves to a high degree of success, the actual social structure is counter to the abilities eventually self-learned by a freethinker [e, f, g].<p>When a person that does not feel part of an institution and does not socialise as readily with it, they are not as easily influenced by the institution they: (h) criticise it and (i) differentiate themselves from it  often this means the band geek buries themselves in music and the nerd starts to read science text books in their spare time. While later on they are not handed the opportunities that would have arisen from a high social status at school they are: (j) less impeded by new hierarchies that they join, (k) now promoted based on the merits that they fostered while on the fringes of the educational institution.<p>On the contrary, the person that felt one with the institution and was celebrated for conforming to the values of its social structure has now learned behaviour that: (l) either brings no benefit to their existence in the new hierarchies or (m) actually counts against them. Worst of all, since they never learnt how to exist apart from a hierarchy (n) they prefer the security of groups over the risk of trying to do things their own way, (o) are likely to lack technical skills, (p) and might still be friends with the people they grew up with in school which would create stickyness.<p>As a closing point, of course there are exceptions, for instance: there are those with (q) leadership qualities and (r) high emotional intelligence that were successul at school while also able to control their school experience to their own long-term advantage. There are also many unsuccessful geeks and nerds whom only gain (s) intellectual skills, (t) simply belonged to a much worse-off social clique with the same problems, and most importantly (u) never learn to socialise and take risks.",1309017791

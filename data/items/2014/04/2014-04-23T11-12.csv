7633385,comment,7633254,7633254,7,0,adrianoconnor,,,"I dislike mocks. I&#x27;ve never seen the point in testing code against an entirely fictional representation of the most complicated and slow part of the system, just because it happens to be more convenient. Of course it&#x27;s more convenient. The only compelling reason I can see for mocks is when you&#x27;ve got code that hits external live-APIs that don&#x27;t give you any real option for automated testing (E.G., reading from and posting to the Twitter API).<p>If an app is worth writing, and worth writing tests for, do it justice and test the whole shooting match. Yeah it&#x27;s hard, but that just makes it all the more worth doing. Automate your tests so that they cover everything that is important, from DOM elements on a dynamically built webpage to your model (and therefore the data that gets written to your SQL database), but don&#x27;t pretend that stubs are substitutes for this. If your model relies on a database, let it rely on the database during the tests too, otherwise what exactly are you testing?",1398254328

Have you noticed that many stock applications which are free on Linux require payment on the IPhone and IPad? Don’t want to re-implement Linux software on IOS ? QMole is a new desktop system allowing the free operation of software ported from the world of Linux on the IPad. The technology enables retaining a touch screen operation of stock GTK Linux applications without requiring their redesign or reimplementation. Unlike remote desktop solutions that require a network connection, QMole requires none. All “Linux” applications execute locally on iPad, just like native IOS applications.<p>QMole features a tiling window manager, transparency, virtual desktop support and an initial desktop application bundle combined with support for developing in Lisp, C, C++, Java, Clojure, Lua, Scheme, OCaml, Python, Perl and more.<p>Are you interested in collaborating on this effort?

If only he can get the right person at the other end of the line, then everything will certainly be sorted out! The Castle is there to serve the developer, so of course there is someone at the Castle who cares: it must be that he just hasn&#x27;t got the word yet...<p><i>&quot;My dear Land Surveyor,&quot; replied the Superintendent, &quot;how on earth should I know all the sons of all the under-castellans?&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;Right,&quot; said K., &quot;then you&#x27;ll just have to take my word that he is one. I had a sharp encounter with this Schwarzer on the very day of my arrival. Afterwards he made a telephone inquiry of an under-castellan called Fritz and received the information that I was engaged as Land Surveyor. How do you explain that, Superintendent?&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;Very simply,&quot; replied the Superintendent. &quot;You haven&#x27;t once up till now come into real contact with our authorities. All those contacts of yours have been illusory, but owing to your ignorance of the circumstances you take them to be real. And as for the telephone. As you see, in my place, though I&#x27;ve certainly enough to do with the authorities, there&#x27;s no telephone. In inns and suchlike places it may be of real use, as much use say as a penny in-the-slot musical instrument, but it&#x27;s nothing more than that. Have you ever telephoned here? Yes? Well, then perhaps you&#x27;ll understand what I say. In the Castle the telephone works beautifully of course, I&#x27;ve been told it&#x27;s going there all the time, that naturally speeds up the work a great deal. We can hear this continual telephoning in our telephones down here as a humming and singing, you must have heard it too. Now this humming and singing transmitted by our telephones is the only real and reliable thing you&#x27;ll hear, everything else is deceptive. There&#x27;s no fixed connexion with the Castle, no central exchange transmits our calls further. When anybody calls up the Castle from here the instruments in all the subordinate departments ring, or rather they would all ring if practically all the departments -1 know it for a certainty - didn&#x27;t leave their receivers off. Now and then, however, a fatigued official may feel the need of a little distraction, especially in the evenings and at night and may hang the receiver on. Then we get an answer, but an answer of course that&#x27;s merely a practical joke. And that&#x27;s very understandable too. For who would take the responsibility of interrupting, in the middle of the night, the extremely important work up there that goes on furiously the whole time, with a message about his own little private troubles? I can&#x27;t comprehend how even a stranger can imagine that when he calls up Sordini, for example, it&#x27;s really Sordini that answers. Far more probably it&#x27;s a little copying clerk from an entirely different department. On the other hand, it may certainly happen once in a blue moon that when one calls up the little copying clerk Sordini will answer himself. Then finally the best thing is to fly from the telephone before the first sound comes through.&quot;</i>",1398253575

I am still gob-smacked to think of that much lead spinning a 2km/sec. I don&#x27;t have the knowledge of supersonic fluid flows to be able to evaluate that. The paper itself points out various difficulties, including delamination, decavitation, jet formation with speeds up to 6km/sec, and:<p>>  practically generating shocks mechanically at Mach numbers greater than 1.5 without destroying the machine that creates them (as is the focus of this work) seems challenging. For example, a steel piston impacting liquid lead to produce an approximately Mach 1.1 shock would see a compressive stress of approximately 2 GPa, well above the yield stress of most steels.<p>The paper talks about pressures up to 400 GPa. Another back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests 20 GPa of centrifugal force at the equator, which of course means the pumps need all the more force. This is well beyond a regime where I can make any mechanical estimates.<p>At this point I suggest that the biggest problem is the engineering to bring the lead up to speed, keeping the sphere in shape with that much force on it, generating a plasma collapse through all of that, and connecting everything to the heat exchanger.

A machine that only answers to other machines in the same organization should be assigned an address in the 10.0.0.0/8 range. If the organization is not large, even 192.168.0.0/16 would do. In fact, many people would argue that assigning public IP addresses to intranet resources is very bad for security.<p>Of course, some of these machines actually might have valid justification for squatting on a public IPv4 address. Perhaps their firewalls are configured to drop all packets except those from a handful of &quot;trusted&quot; IP addresses, so a random scanner on the Internet gets no response.<p>But I doubt that such cases account for the majority of &quot;seemingly unused&quot; IPv4 blocks. What&#x27;s more likely is that some large organization was assigned a massive block of IPs 20-30 years ago and never found much use for them. IBM owns 9/8. Xerox owns 13/8. HP owns 15/8. Apple owns 17/8. Ford owns 19/8. Several pharmaceutical and chemical companies also own an /8 each, as do some universities. Do they really need 16.7 million public IPv4 addresses? Of course not.

Look, I work for a credit card company, and we have a great deal of experience with evaluating customers and predicting risk of default. A customer choosing to reschedule a loan does not necessarily mean that they WILL go in default, but it is almost certainly an indicator that increases the probability that they will. I am not suggesting you should consider them in arrears (they aren&#x27;t!) but that you should take payment rescheduling into account as a leading predictor of future default rates on cohorts of loans that have not yet reached default.<p>> we aim to improve our Statistics page to use a single metric to encompass both ended and current loans...<p>Depending on how well that metric is designed, that might actually LOSE information.<p>> ...and allow users to filter the data by date disbursed.<p>That will definitely be useful. In my experience, graphing key indicators (like default rate, repayment rate, loan profit, number of loans made, and leading indicators of default) by cohort (grouping by start date) is a really good way to view your data to determine whether changes in lending policy are having the intended effects. Since your policies have changed recently, this sort of view may prove very useful.",1398252241

7633229,comment,7632094,7632094,4,0,roymurdock,,,"&quot;In Steppenwolf&#x27;s case, the fact is that, like all hybrid creatures, he lived with the feeling of being sometimes a wolf, sometimes a human being. However, as a wolf he was forever conscious of his human side lying in wait, observing, judging and condemning him; just as the wolf did when he was a human being. For example, whenever Harry in his capacity as a human being had some lovely idea, experience some fine and noble sentiment, or did a so-called good deed, the wolf in him would bare its teeth and laugh him utterly to scorn, indicating how ludicrously out of character all this fine play-acting was in a wild animal of the steppes, a wolf who at heart knew perfectly well that his real pleasure lay in stalking alone across the plains, occasionally blood or pursuing a she-wolf. Seen thus from the wolf&#x27;s point of view, every human action became frighteningly comic and self-conscious, vain and inane. But it was exactly the same when Harry felt and behaved like a wolf, when he showed other people his teeth or became murderously hostile to humankind as a whole, hating all its hypocritical and degenerate manners and customs. For then it was the human side of him that lay in wait, observing the wolf, calling him a brute and a beast, spoiling and souring all the pleasure he was taking in the straightforward life of a healthy untamed wolf...<p>His position was a lonely one; it was uncanny the way the world left him to his own devices. Other people were longer of concern to him; he wasn&#x27;t even concerned about himself. The air around him was getting thinner and thinner the more solitary he became, severing all contact with others, and he was slowly suffocating as a result. For the situation now was different. No longer his desire and goal, solitude and independence were a fate he was condemned to. He had made his magic wish and there was no going back on it. However strongly he yearned to re-establish contact with others, however willing he was to hold out his arms to embrace them, it was of no avail: they now left him alone. Yet there was no indication that people hated him or found him repugnant. On the contrary; he had lots of friends. Lots of people liked him. But friendliness and sympathy were the only reactions he ever encountered. People would invite him to their homes, give him presents, write him nice letters, but nobody was able or willing to share his life. He was no breathing the air that the lonely breathe, living in an atmosphere that was still, adrift from the world around him. No amount of yearning or goodwill had any effect on his inability to form relationships.&quot;<p>Steppenwolf - Hermann Hesse",1398251783

7633223,comment,7632094,7632094,3,0,youRallMad,,,"Do men suck at friendships? the answer is yes but because most of us never try,<p>Personal Ramble<p>It all starts when we are children. Look at how young boys and girls play. Boys will do things together, play football, play video games talk about things they do (notice the DO, guys like to DO things). Girls will play games around social events, and developing their social hierarchy. Girls learn from a young age how to operate in social groups. boys do not tend to learn these skills until teenage years, until then they will entertain themselves<p>To make the point, say 2 boys have an argument, they are more likely to come to blows, fight and then drop the issue, dealing with the issue. Girls on the other hand will use talking/and social to punish those that they are fighting with. Social exclusion is the general form of punishment for girls that do not follow the established social hierarchy of a school system. This is simply to highlight the differences between boys and girls as children (aka less time for social manipulation in to pre-defined roles)<p>The above i feel is a biological difference in the way that men and women operate even at young ages. This is still in us as adults. (there are a number of studies about this point, boys raised as girls and so on, personally i KNOW that boys and girls are biologically different and in turn you can not just tell someone to be a girl or boy, it is hard coded (trying to highlight that I do not believe that the role of girls and boys are interchangeable as some people imply; I believe trans and other gender identity issues are based on biological triggers))<p>So moving on, i might be getting to a point<p>In my part of the world men are taught from a young age to be &#x27;strong&#x27;, &#x27;leaders&#x27;, &#x27;money earners&#x27;, &#x27;head of the family&#x27;. Men have been exploited throughout history because of this mentality (think men front line of wars, its the mans role to defend his country and not complain (if you ran you got shot), protect our women, and supply our family with money. We are taught to ignore our emotions and to endure (work 8hrs/5days a week for 60 years). This is 1000s of years old, men are the work horses, well minus the very few at the top who pull the strings and certain people use to proclaim that men rule the world.<p>I also believe that we put too much focus on SO to &#x27;complete&#x27; our lives (an extension of the idea that a man should support a family). So many people have said that their SO is their best friend and i think this is great. However as a 30 year old male  I have one group of friends that have all got engaged at the same time, they all getting married within the same few years and they will be having kids at the same time i am sure. My honest option on this is that out of the 5 guys in that group, 4 of them have been pushed in to it by the girls of the group, and the first couple that started it off, well the guy was told he either asked her to marry him or she would ask him that leap year (last year) Basically what happened was one girl wanted to get married and then using that as a president the other girls banded together and got the rest of the guys to ask them.<p>This might sound like  harsh but men need to stop thinking that their lives are about supporting other people, we need to learn that our lives are our own, we are not here to pay bills, support children (if you want to then amazing) but it is not our default roles. Sadly there is such a lack of male roles today that the 9-5 with 2-4 children is now the default. I feel sorry for men, we have been used and abused as wage earners and human targets, we work to support our families all the time self sacrificing our own social well being.<p>i am 30 and spent the last 9 years working on my friendship (balanced between girls and boys these days) and being close with my family. I was one of the most socially difficult people you will never know when young but thanks to lots of practice i can start a conversion with anyone anywhere. I can go to clubs by myself, dancing as an example or the pictures, it is not an issue. I guess i should put in that I have only had few relationships and i have spent more time living on my own that I ever have in relationships but on the flip side, I have a lot of friends (Sounds bad, but i have always feared some girl loading me up with kids and then me spending the rest of my life slaving to support them while they all resent me for never being at home because i am working). One thing i will say is that single guys do tend to socialize together, a lot of my single male friends are all interlinked, and most of my friends in couples are friends with couples. There is very little over lap between these groups. Single guys have different social requirements to men with SOs, and I guess it is a preference to what social groups you prefer.<p>So to all of you what is your priority? to become the default wage earner for a family and then complain that you have no friends? or start making your own path in life, focus on your friends rather than chasing the next SO. Find out who you are, and what you like, and you will have no issues making friends.<p>Be true to yourself, not true to someone else s view of you<p>I guess a summery is... Men and women socialize differently from a young age, i think its hard coded to a large degree. Men have lost their roles in every day life, and (personally) too many men spend their lives supporting family&#x27;s because they believe it is what is expected off them. I say it&#x27;s time for a male revolution, a time when men can band together (pack style) and we can entertain ourself and get out of this rat race that is a life of working to raise a family. There are too many people in the world anyway, do you really want to bring someone in to it? where the hell do you think we will be in 10 years given what has happened over the last 10 years.<p>It is time for Males to start redefining their roles in the world and this will start with you.",1398251643

I just want to write code and I hate the idea of marketing even though I know it&#x27;s an essential part of the process.<p>The obvious thing to do is to submit it to as many review sites as possible, but I&#x27;ve read many articles that say it&#x27;s a waste of time to even try contacting the popular review sites.  Maybe I am hesitant because part of me is a bit reluctant to have it criticized too much? Hmm, not sure about that.<p>I think the main problem is that the game is a &quot;Snake clone&quot;.  IMO it has enough original features to stand up as its own game. But I think many people just see Snake, think &quot;toy project&quot; and walk away.<p>I would really appreciate some feedback on what the HN community thinks.  Should I continue trying to push the game?  Or should I not waste any more time on it and just accept it&#x27;s time to move on?<p>One more point: if I do move on, I won&#x27;t feel like this has been a failure personally.  I am very proud of Foobit - it&#x27;s my first Android game and I can&#x27;t stop playing it!  Also my Son (aged 10) loves it, so it&#x27;s definitely been a worthwhile learning project for me. I&#x27;m just in two minds as to whether I should commit to marketing it or not, that&#x27;s all.<p>Download link for anyone who wants to try it (it&#x27;s free to play): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=iode.foobit",1398251322

There is so much wonderful time to spend outdoors and with friends, especially in summer hours.<p>I think it is a tech thing. When I lived in SF, I used to get out of home at 8 AM. The streets would be empty but for the blue collar workers going to their jobs (showing how much white collar is tech). In NYC, 8 AM is packed. Yet, at work there is an odd split with the tech folks wandering in at 10 AM or what have you and the others at 9 AM sharp. (Approximately of course.)",1398251277

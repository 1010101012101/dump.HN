I have attended concerts by some of the big names--LSO, LA Phil, San Francisco Symphony, Berliner Philharmoniker--as well as by many lesser-known ensembles.

However this just made people curious as to who was crushing them, so they input a number of random friends' emails haphazardly. Those friends did the same. This system promoted curiosity, which demoted sincerity and eventually the sites just ended up with a big email list.<p>Since facebook will give people a good idea of who's using the app, we're hoping that this medium will be adequate, without the use of anonymous emails.",1284417130

You discounted performance because it never matters in web development.  Fine.  Here are 5 more issues that do come up in web development.  Not using native threads makes it easy for a poorly coded C extension (for instance a database driver) to block all threads.  Common classes of errors (eg typos in variable names) can only be caught at run-time.  Some widely used libraries use monkey patching, and with dependencies it is very easy to pull one in without realizing it, only to get burned later in what should be an unrelated library.  By default gem does not run unit tests at installation, which makes it less likely that developers will get prompt feedback about issues like platform-specific code or unspecified dependencies.  While mix-ins are convenient, they provide opportunities for conflicts and make it harder to track down the source of a method when you're trying to debug something.<p>I don't even use Ruby very much.  If I did, I could easily come up with a much larger list.  (My primary language is Perl.  You should see the list of complaints I have about it!  Yet I still like it.  And for the record I like Ruby as well.)<p><i>Edit:</i> I only included 4 issues initially, so I just added another.",1284417041

Cabs advertise could computing instead of strip clubs.<p>2. It was tough to find cabs in the Mission district.<p>3. The city never seemed like much of a walking city. The neighborhoods are far apart and everyone has cars.<p>4. There are lots of cafes and on average they serve better coffee than nyc.<p>5. The food is a little bit cheaper than nyc.<p>6. The architecture seems much for uniform and nicer than nyc buildings. Sure nyc has its brownstones, but there are not that many of them.<p>7. Some of the highest yelp rated bars in the Union Square area were closed on Sunday nights. This would never happen in nyc.<p>8. I couldn't imagine how people go out to bars if they have to drive.<p>9. The weather gets a little too cold in the evenings/nights.<p>10. Restaurants serve more generous portions of wine and the average restaurant has a pretty good wine list.<p>11. I heard the tenderloin area was sketchy, but at least in the area just around Union Square, I never saw anything like that.",1284415541

This won't add to the existing problem in any significant manner.<p>The <i>real</i> problem is that we don't need enough orchestras to actually sustain orchestras as an industry anymore, and the attempts to get around this fact are based in emotion, not fact or economics. I do not celebrate this, in fact I have the same emotional reaction many people do, but nevertheless I see it clearly: Classical music is not economically viable. We might as well record what we can while the orchestras still exist; at least the recordings will sound as good in 100 years as they do today.",1284415417

I have lived in DC for a few years, and I suspect that the OP was not keyed into such activities in the DC area.  There is a very large population of highly educated individuals in the DC area across a wide range of professions, industries, etc.  There is a thriving private sector in the DC area, and it is not just government-oriented.  Hilton and Marriott, for instance, are based in the DC area.  The DC area has one of the highest, if not the highest, proportions of knowledge workers in the country, including a very large IT community and a healthy startup community.  Also, the OP must have been too far out in the 'burbs.  The DC Metro system is one of the best in the country, and it extends out into the suburbs.  In many areas of DC and closer-in suburbs, you could easily get by without having a car if you live near a Metro station.  Zipcar also has a very large presence in DC.  Overall, the DC area offers a very high quality of life professionally, culturally, and educationally and in terms of opportunities for a range of outdoor activities and professional athletics.",1284415405

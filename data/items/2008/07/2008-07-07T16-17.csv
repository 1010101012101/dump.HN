238770,comment,238544,238654,0,0,gruseom,,,"You can. In a way, writing tests first is all about exploring. You're only specifying what you're trying to achieve in the next little while. The test is a device to tell you when you've achieved it. Then you move to the next step. What you're trying to do overall still evolves.<p>There is a tradeoff. You end up with a longer program that does the same thing - that's bad. On the other hand it works better, and you're likelier to know if you break something - that's good. People argue about whether the bad exceeds the good or vice versa, but surely that can't be answered all one way or the other.<p>My experience is that this style of programming is well suited for the OO environments that it emerged from. OO object graphs get complex very quickly and you need a device for managing side effects (i.e. unexpected breakage). Unit tests, specifically TDD, are the best currently known device for that. But to me a better approach is to program functionally in a way that eschews (most) side effects and to test one's code by evaluating expressions in a REPL. That gives most of the benefits of unit testing in a much lighter-weight form. I still write the occasional unit test, but only in targeted places where the code has to do something tricky and I want to keep a record of good examples. All I do in that case is put the expressions I've been playing with in the REPL into a function somewhere.",1215448167

That's a pretty big deal if you didn't know about it (as one person who /was/ on my wedding vacation - and now must stay at home - found out to their dismay).<p>It's unlikely anything relating to some marijuana use will destroy your life or impede you significantly, but even not being able to travel freely between countries /could/ be an impediment, especially if such travel is necessary for your job, etc.<p>This is the least of it, of course.

Can anyone improve on my stats here?<p>So, while I originally hoped to show you were wrong, I have to conclude it is a significant risk and getting riskier.

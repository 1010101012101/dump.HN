Some women are into that. I feel like you are unnecessarily close-minded about the idea that women might like a range of experiences. I also agree with other commenters on their ideas that naming porn conventions do not actually indicate suffering, pain, and degradation.<p>3) True. Porn is not meant as educational material; be safe.<p>4) It does create unrealistic expectations, but almost nobody expects porn to be like real life.<p>Female porn stars do get to choose what kind of sex they have. I hate victim blame just as much as the next woman, but saying that porn stars can choose what to do is not victim blame. Porn stars live in a world where they get paid for what they decide to do. The skin industry does have some people who are not there by choice but necessity...but the vast majority are there because they chose to follow that route. Though I think concern for the performers is admirable, most performers are ok with where they are. It's actually a little bit ridiculous that men get up in arms about women when they choose to go into the industry; it's a mostly free choice. Men act like the performers can't like what they do, which is wrong. <a href=""http://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/its-a-lap-dance-accept-it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/its-a-lap-dance-a...</a>",1360993425

5230537,comment,5226792,5228302,2,0,dredmorbius,,,"My impression of the Chelyabinsk meteor was that it fragmented significantly about 14-15s after first appearance.  This would have greatly increased its surface area, and likely wasted a significant portion of its kinetic energy at that point.  So the power delivery curve wouldn't be completely smooth or continuous.<p>That said, a nuclear device delivers virtually all of its energy as ionizing radiation (5%), thermal pulse (30-50%), blast (40-50%), and residual radiation (5-10%).  The actual nuclear reaction takes less than 0.5 milliseconds, the thermal radiation pulse generally lasts several seconds, more for exceptionally large weapons (e.g.: Tsar Bomba, 50 MT).<p>The distinction between total energy delivery, and rate of delivery, is key.   Gunpowder and TNT are actually significantly <i>less</i> energy dense than kerosene, but release that energy much more quickly.  The destruction of the WTC towers in 9/11 was the result of aviation-fuel driven fires burning in a structure for many minutes, rather than a single explosive pulse.<p>The mode of energy delivery also matters.  For a meteor, the principle delivery is heat, light, and shock.  With nukes you've got both ionizing radiation and fallout to be concerned with (generally 10-20% of total energy).<p>This is also a point I raised regarding financial market collapses, when a professor tried to point out that the stock market had survived 25% declines before the 1987 crash.  Sure, but over time. Would you prefer going from 60 MPH to zero in 4 seconds or 0.06 seconds (about the time it takes your seat front to find the front bumper in a static-barrier impact)?",1360993257

In notabug he says child porn should be legalized and he supports the overthrow of the US Government - are you also saying then that he is a child porn user and terrorist since he advocates for both?<p>I myself share many of his views and more. What does that mean for me though? Here are some examples. I believe US patent law is very dysfunctional, and that copyright privilege has been extended far past the length that they best serve the public good. I agree with Aaron's statement that child porn laws are used to torment people who don't actually harm children. I also find that drug laws are used as a tool of persecution against minority communities, the US engages in terrorist actions against innocent people using drone strikes and targeted assassinations, that there is extensive corruption in the judicial system. I agree that everyone does have the right to republish both papers out of copyright, and those explicitly in the public domain. I agree that it is absurd that the academic journal system is dysfunctional and often takes publicly funded work, for which it has paid the author and researcher nothing, and seizes copyright and places it behind a paywall, which is an abomination.<p>I am not the only one with these beliefs either, each of them is common enough among the public as to be a normal and reasonable position held by many.<p>Despite all these beliefs, I have never uploaded copyrighted material to bittorrent other than works I personally own the copyright to. I have never engaged in terrorist action against the government. I have never done illegal drugs. I have never looked at, possessed or transmitted child porn. My positions that certain things that have been criminalized which should not be, and that the law is not working well in some areas, is not evidence whatsoever that I have engaged in any of these acts. You however make the claim that because Swartz advocated ""to take stuff that's out of copyright and add it to the archive."" and because he actually did take public domain legal documents and legally place them in public archives, that this means his analysis of the JSTOR archive was not analysis at all but was to steal the copyrighted material there.<p>That is an absurd accusation. You might as well accuse him of distributing child porn and being a terrorist, because decriminalizing child porn and overthrowing the government were also things he advocated in his writings. Making the claim that people who see the injustice in US drug laws and call for drug law reform are obviously drug users themselves is a non sequitor argument.",1360992874

I can see that being stochastically effective.<p>Personally no, but you easily could.<p>> It really depends on what your cost/benefit tradeoffs are.<p>Well, realistically, to facilitate automated deployment and testing of multi-machine systems you <i>really do need</i> to be operating at this level of abstraction. (ie. to declare your desired state). Once you reach this point, a configuration file for some version of a package within some node is really a distraction rather than a help; it should have been abstracted to some known-good state and taken out of the equation if you are to have any hope of staying sane. Many people use entire system images coupled with service monitoring as the de-facto segregation point for management purposes.<p>> Do you just kill and relaunch periodically? I can see that being stochastically effective.<p>While that's entirely possible and probably a reasonable approach in some cases, the corosync/pacemaker de-facto/spiritual approach is to detect issues with a given resource (roughly: 'service instance'), automatically destroy it and fail over to another instance thereof, and then potentially start another instance to replace it automatically on the same, or some other cluster node. To facilitate rapid failover, the master/slave paradigm allows you to have live backup nodes running and promote them as masters easily.  Any type of hardware or software can be scripted as a managed resource. The type and frequency of  resource health monitoring checks can be custom defined.",1360991827

For Hiroshima, most blast damage was confined to a radius of 1.6 km from ground zero, roughly correlating to an overpressure of 5 psi.

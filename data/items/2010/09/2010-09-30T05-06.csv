Which is the only order which makes much sense anyway - if the backbones can't route your packet, what's the point in speaking that language?<p>ISP-level NATs don't make sense, except in connecting external-IPv6 to internal-IPv4, in which case: so?  Only serve up the IPv4 connections which currently exist, creating no new ones and dynamically mapping no ports, and pass through all IPv6.  And if I recall correctly, IPv4 addresses are reserved in a range of IPv6 addresses already, so translating is a non-issue if the in-between is all IPv6.  Any attempt to access IPv6-only addresses from IPv4 get fake IPv4 addresses, probably as some hashed value so repeat connections yield the same result.<p>External-IPv4 to internal-IPv6: yeah, <i>full</i> of issues.

Much of my family is Irish Catholic, and I wouldn't broach the subject with them.<p>As for the good works the Church does, that really is inconsequential.  Hamas runs schools, and Pablo Escobar was a pillar of the community.  The good works one does do not absolve one of one's sins.  My biggest problem with the Church and its apologists is the rather offhanded manner in which these issues are shrugged off.  ""Yes, we raped thousands of children, and provided the rapists with access to further children, but we're better now.""  ""Yes, we told millions of uneducated people in AIDS-ridden sub-Saharan Africa that condoms increase their chances of getting AIDS, but the jury's still out on that.""<p>I would have no problem forgiving the church if they offered a genuine mea culpa, turned in every child-raping priest to the authorities, and reversed their policy on condoms in AIDS-ridden and over-populated areas of the world.  Far from that, however, Mr. Ratzinger has only further exacerbated these issues.  I don't believe that mere membership provides material support to these activities, but every dollar you put in the donation plate does.<p>As for the ""child abuse"" issue:  My dad was raised in a Catholic neighbourhood, and attended a Catholic school.  The nuns would smack him with a ruler if he answered a question wrong.  <i>That's</i> child abuse.  Putting your penis inside a child is child <i>rape</i>.  There is a huge difference between the two, and suggesting that the latter is equivalent to the former smacks of equivocation.<p>I understand that you are not your church, just as I understand that Israelis are not Israel.  Like that example, however, the support that you provide the church, be it direct or otherwise, is at least partially responsible for its actions.  Just as Israelis are responsible for the atrocities carried out against Palestinians, just as Americans are responsible for the atrocities inflicted on Iraqis, Hell, just as we Canadians are responsible for the actions of our government, so too are you responsible for the actions of your church.",1285824123

If it's empty, zero, otherwise one (for the head) plus however long the rest is.""",1285823261

Their site went down for a few minutes a little bit later, which briefly caused some problems, but other than that I'm excited to see what results come from using their service.

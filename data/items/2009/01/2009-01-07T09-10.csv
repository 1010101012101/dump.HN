423240,comment,422813,422813,0,0,earl,,,"The power of R (speaking as a very heavy user who has deployed it in multiple production environments and been using it for 5 years) is that it makes it very fast, easy, and natural to do statistics.  It also has the nicest data structure I've ever seen for manipulating table data, called a data frame -- I'll elaborate, if anybody cares.  In addition, it encourages people to create packages to extend the functionality.  There are extant packages to do almost every analysis you can think of -- time series, kmeans, other clustering techniques, cox-box style analyses, regular maximum likelihood style GLM, hierarchical regression, HB, etc.  Further, the amount of knowledge and the open source nature of the language, base, and packages encourage additional development and widespread adoption.

^ is task views.  Explore it -- it's well worth your time.<p>The downsides are, well, it's slow for large data sets and debugging can be difficult.  But as a desktop / rapid development platform for statistics it is without peer, IMO.<p>ps -- unlike Matlab, which often costs thousands of dollars, and the Statistics Toolbox, more thousands, R is free.  This is pretty important on its own -- instead of $5k per server and workstation and home pc, install it on any linux, Mac, or windows box you have and get to work for $0.00.",1231321469

It is more about banding together in the local community for a common cause which is to empower the community, provide support for each other, and those far away.<p>I could write pages, but will leave one example for each.<p>Empower the Community<p>The church I attend has 50 people who volunteer at least once a week in one of three different local grade schools that are low performing schools.  These schools do not have many (to none) parent volunteers.  Members also have donated 3 new books for each child in the schools, along with providing items that the school needs but are not budgeted by the State.<p>Support for each other:<p>About 8 years ago when I was between jobs we did not have enough money to buy any presents for our children that Christmas.  Someone found out and the church we attend came through with 3x what we would have spent if we did have the money.  The kids would have been happy enough with a few things from the dollar store but they were much happier with an amazing Christmas.<p>Those far away<p>Last year our Son (age 12) was able to help put together a large play structure for an orphanage in Mexico.  It wasn't some cheap Chinese plastic play structure but one that was solidly hand-built to last and handle the use by 30 orphans.  This was a good experience for our Son as well to go out and see first hand that there is a lot of need out in the world that is unaddressed.",1231321016

However, running through the list of GUI kits the poster has assessed, Shoes differs significantly in that it incorporates web-style widgets on the desktop.  It is much more suited to graphical applications and games than native desktop software.<p>Two thumbs down for wxWidgets.  I used the wxPython port to prototype a not-too-complex desktop application, and found it tediously cumbersome (not to mention ugly).  I would've been better off coding it natively in Obj-C and then porting it down the track.",1231319242

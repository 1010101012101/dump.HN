Things have been going well so far, but Finder seems a little non-structural and limited, and I'm not alone - it seems there's about 20 or so different file manager apps for OS X. Is HN able to provide me with some pointers? Is there a Textmate of file managers?<p>Here's what I'm missing from Finder:<p>- Proper collapsible/expandable tree view<p>- Ability to see and create symlinks<p>- See file access, create, modify times<p>- Preview of SVG files<p>- SFTP/SCP support<p>- ACL / old style mode changes<p>- Nautilus style icon or text navigation pane (so I can \npaste a file path)<p>- General single window operation - I shouldn't ever need to open another window to move or copy files",1240052340

568253,comment,568079,568245,0,0,davidw,,,"I keep hauling out the 'Information Rules' book because it's so good... I just picked it up and looked, and they do cover price discrimination some.  There are plenty of examples where it's not really unfair, mostly where people self-select.<p>For instance, coupons are a way of getting people to buy something they may not have otherwise bought, with the thinking that those who have time to sit around clipping them out are a group of people with less money than those who simply don't care and go to the store and buy stuff without looking at the price much.<p>Student and senior discounts are another one that doesn't strike most people as 'unfair'.",1240051848

568243,comment,567807,568239,0,0,davidw,,,"Exactly - I should clarify the ""helped me a lot"" in my previous post was more in terms of meeting lots of people  and having fun than going home every night with some girl (although the owner of our favorite place once impressed us by showing up, spotting some girl, dancing a few songs and then heading out the door together).  It eventually worked out pretty well because the woman I ended up marrying liked going dancing a lot when we first met:-)",1240050797

I did it not so long ago (still am) and it's a brilliant confidence boost; everyone's there for the same reason, so it's not like just going to some club and hoping someone there will talk to you! You've got something in common, something to have a laugh about with every person there.<p>Go into it with the right attitude and you will have fun. Don't fall into the trap that some men do and think ""ooh, such-and-such a magazine says salsa classes will get me laid"", cause on their own they won't. Girls there can spot the guys who go there with one intention from miles off and <i>won't</i> dance with them. Go there with the intention to have a bit of a giggle, meet a few new people, make a bit of a tit of yourself on occasion (something we ALL need!) and learn some sexy moves while you're at it and the world is your oyster.<p>(Sorry for the disjointed response, I'm rushing out of the door!

It'll likely go to 10k/s or more... probably until the bandwidth is saturated.<p>Writing an HTTP server is easy. But making one that handles long lived connections (10s of thousands), and scales well, doesn't eat memory, doesn't eat CPU, etc etc is harder.<p>Having said that, it's easy enough that I think it's often worth doing if the webserver is integral to your success (It is with Mibbit).",1240049936
568236,comment,567807,568209,0,0,adrianwaj,,,"Also, the alpha and dark males probably get the bigger rejections, and that's what the nice guys are seeking to avoid. So that's another factor for the struggling males, being able to pursue but then being able to pick yourself up after a rejection.<p>There's another factor at work to, 'consent.' A nice guy wants the interaction to be consensual, and it should be, but in a way she doesn't because as you say there's a stigma to it, but then again if she never gives consent, she'll not only end up attracting the aholes and be quietly looking for them to satiate her 'guilty pleasures', but also on the downside she'll lock herself out of the nice guys because giving consent will be too painful, and when she does, he may be ultimately turned off.<p>In the end, she'll marry a somewhat inexperienced nice bloke to raise the kids after being used and abused by the aholes, and she may cheat on him if her issues are unresolved.",1240049926

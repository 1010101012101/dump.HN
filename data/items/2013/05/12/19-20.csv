I really liked the device.<p>My problem was the fucked up regional annoyances. If you are not in USA, good luck! No full size skydrive photo uploads for you! No Xbox online.. No album covers in music app. A lot of missing apps in store. No this, no that. Well, I have no such problems with iPhone and Android.<p>BTW: After I switched, I sold my Lumia to a friend and used factory reset before handing the phone. Guess what? There is a known bug in factory reset that bricks the phone and it was apparently not fixed in 2 firmware upgrades that I got during that time :)",1368388758

Software deevelopment is analogous to making the protoype, not the copies. A replica of the prototype should be able to pass the same tests the prototype can - that's why manufacturers can get away with only testing a sample of them. You can be sure that the protoype has gone through rigorous specifications testing.<p>I think that you can look at part specifications as writing a test. The component we're aiming for has to meet x, y, and z standards. Then you design the component, then you make sure it meets those standards. If not, iterate. Pretty analogous, I'd say.",1368388664

There you will see just what\nyou are asking for except mostly the\nbusinesses are not in information technology,\nWeb 2.0, mobile apps, etc.  Instead the\nbusinesses are dentists, pizza shops,\nChinese carryout, franchised fast food,\nauto repair, auto body repair, lawn services,\nplant nurseries, boutique retailing, \nkitchen and bath remodeling, roofing,\ndriveway installation, other construction \ntrades, CPAs, general practice lawyers,\nauto dealers, bakeries -- get the pattern?<p>Can look at an information technology startup\nessentially the same way.  A great example\nis the Canadian matchmaking site Plenty of\nFish -- long just one person, two old Dell\nservers, ads just from Google, and $10 \nmillion a year in revenue.<p>There are some advantages to an information\ntechnology startup:  First, if connect \na server to the Internet and keep it busy\nsending Web pages with ads, then at common\nad rates will get the five figures a month\nin revenue.  E.g., send two Web pages a\nsecond, send an average of four ads per page,\nget the charge per 1000 ads displayed (CPM)\naverage of $2.125 in the KPCB Meeker report,\nand then get monthly revenue of<p><pre><code>  2.125 * 4 * 2 * 3600 * 24 * 30 / 1000 = 44,064\n</code></pre>\ndollars.  So, the advantage?  Sure:  The server\nstands to be something can plug together in\nan afternoon from parts that cost less than\n$2000 in total.  So, $2000 in capital equipment\nand $44 K a month in revenue.  Darned near a \nlicense to print money and totally blows away\neverything else, legal or not, on Main Street.<p>If the usage keeps growing, fine:  Get more servers.\nElse, the $44 K a month will do fine for \nproviding for a family.<p>Moreover, most of the work is just learning\nthe coding skills, e.g., in the Microsoft\nworld, .NET, ASP.NET, ADO.NET, IIS, system\nmanagement and administration.  Then if the\nfirst Web 2.0 site flops, use the skills\nto bring up another one.<p>But, it might grow, especially if it was\ncarefully planned to from the beginning\nto grow.

What Zuckerberg did for Instagram was self-serving charity: he essentially used a billion dollars worth of capital to perpetuate the startup bubble (think of how many MBAs are going to flock to California now hoping to become the next Instagram), which only helps Facebook in the long run (once the bubble pops, no one's going to be buying ads from them anymore).<p>Any reasonable businessperson would see a company like Instagram for what it is: a server with some data on it.

Historically, postsecondary education might have been limited to the disciplines of academia and focused solely on liberal arts. However, at this point, a four-year degree is an effective prerequisite to 90% of white-collar job. (Irrespective of the actual value of a degree in performing jobs, of course. Obviously, the overwhelming majority of professions don't require four years of institutional training or education to perform. Indeed, I'd wager that most careers don't require academic knowledge beyond that of a seventh grader.)<p>So, college has been perverted by the labor market into a corollary of the K-12, ""career-preparatory"" apparatus, and few students enter college in pursuit of actual intelectual stimulation. Most are simply going through the motions to get an entry level job. In effect, college has simply become a funnel from high school to the labor market. We can debate about whether or not this is good, but the fact remains that, given the current post-secondary education landscape, colleges exist to get people jobs and should be measured by that standard.<p>As for only K-12 being government-funded and thus career-oriented, many if not most students take federal aid of some sort, implicating public funding even for private colleges.

5695482,comment,5693871,5693871,1,0,graycat,,,"The article throws out the baby with the bathwater.\nLet's focus on the consumer market for US grades\n7-12 and vocational education, especially computing.<p>For fine arts such as singing, piano, violin, other\ninstruments in a symphony orchestra, guitar, dance,\npainting, sculpture, photography, etc. it appears\nthat overwhelmingly the way children make progress\nis (A) their family has some expertise and\nencourages their children and (B) the education is\navailable in the home, in the church (e.g., for\nchoir), or from private tutors, e.g., a local piano\nor violin teacher.  E.g., for violin, consider Ms.\nCaroline Goulding as at<p><pre><code>     http://www.carolinegoulding.com/\n</code></pre>\nOr consider Ms. Alina Ibragimova playing the Bach\n'Chaconne' as at<p><pre><code>     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tezau3hlRxs\n</code></pre>\nShe's good; the last part of the first D-minor\nsection is world class work.  Tough to believe that\nshe learned how to do that in a standard school!<p>For the consumer market for grades 7-12, before a\nconsumer will devote much time or energy to\neducation, they need to know that there will be a\n'payoff' from official education 'certification'\nwhich mostly means better grades in grades 9-12 or\nhigher scores on tests of the College Entrance\nExamination Board (CEEB), e.g., as at<p><pre><code>     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Board\n</code></pre>\nOf course good scores on CEEB tests are useful for\ngetting into college and getting college\nscholarships.<p>So, really such consumer education has to aim at\nexisting graded courses in grades 9-12 and/or\nsubjects tested by the CEEB.<p>Now we face a hard lesson:  Doing well on these aims\nis ""not a spectator sport"", more work than just\nwatching TV, and a lot of hard work.<p>For such learning, the first source is the student's\nusual school.  For more, the student may want some\ntutoring.  A few students want to do better than\nwhat is available in the school.<p>For tutoring, here's an approach:  Find what are the\nmore popular textbooks and develop some videos tied\nclosely to those main books.  Then a student who\nneeds tutoring, or just to get ready for a test on\nMonday, could use the videos for just the place they\nare in their textbook.<p>For going beyond what is available in the school, a\nstudent could use some guidance and then the\nlearning materials.  For going beyond, we are really\naiming just at some CEEB tests, in particular, the\ntests of the College Level Examination Program\n(CLEP) as at<p><pre><code>     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Level_Examination_Program\n</code></pre>\nFor the course content, just get some of the best\navailable textbooks and then maybe have some\ncorresponding supplementary videos.  Some on-line\ntests so that a student could 'check their progress'\nwould be helpful.<p>E.g., maybe a student wants to do well in calculus.\nSo, get a book on calculus aimed at the CLEP test in\ncalculus.<p>For still more, that is, for an ambitious student in\ngrades 9-12, just aim at the subject matter tests of\nthe GRE.<p>For vocational, the audience of Hacker News the\nunique, world class cream of such education.  Why?\nBecause in the US, nearly all education in practical\ncomputing is from self teaching from books, on-line\nfora, practicing at a computer, on-line\ndocumentation, e.g., the Microsoft MSDN Web pages,\netc.<p>Improving such vocational education?  Not easy\nbecause it would involve at least writing better\nbooks than the best ones already available from\nO'Reilly, Microsoft Press, and many other publishers\nand better Web sites, fora, etc.  For one company in\neducation to improve on all those sources is\nhopelessly difficult.<p>So, where do I see a significant startup opportunity\nin education for grades 9-12 and vocational\neducation?  I don't.  Really, that's good news:  The\nCEEB seems to have the needed means of\n'certification', their tests.  Otherwise, get some\ngood learning materials, commonly just textbooks\nalthough maybe PDFs downloaded from the Internet.<p>The bottleneck is the work -- no spectator sport and\nno royal road.  Instead hard work.  E.g., look at\nthe left hand finger tips of Ms. Ibragimova; they\nare bent backwards.  So were those of Jascha\nHeifetz.  Why?  Thousands of hours of intense\npractice.  Hard work.<p>I did some such things:  (1) I'm no good at violin,\nhave too little talent and never practiced nearly\nenough, but I did make it through the D-major\nsection of 'Chaconne' and parts of the rest mostly\nvia being self-taught. (2) I never took freshman\ncalculus.  The college where I did my freshman year\nwas not so good and pushed everyone into a 'college\nalgebra' class a bit beneath what I'd already done\nin high school (in the same city as the college but\nthe best high school in the city -- Dad carefully\nselected where he bought his house).  So, I showed\nup for the tests only and otherwise got a good\ncalculus book and dug in.  For my sophomore year, I\nwent to a much better college and one that happened\nto have a quite good math department and just\nstarted on their sophomore calculus from Johnson and\nKiokemeister, then also used at Harvard.  It's a\ngood calculus book.  Did fine:  Made As in that\ncalculus, got Honors in Math, and 800 on the math\nsubject matter test of the GRE. (3) I continued with\na lot of largely independent study much like I'd\nused for freshman calculus, and that background was\ncrucial for my Ph.D. in Engineering -- really some\napplied math.  (4) My career has been in applied\nmath and computing.  I've taught computing in two\nwell-known universities, but I never really took a\ncourse in it and, instead, was essentially\nself-taught, as is nearly standard on HN.<p>One little victory:  One Christmas at the farm of my\nwife's family, I was upstairs practicing violin.  A\nbright daughter, about 9, of one of my wife's\nsisters came up and watched.  So I put my violin bow\nin her right hand, showing her how to position her\nfingers to hold it (the more natural Russian way\nHeifetz used and not the less natural German way!),\nput the violin under her left chin, and let her make\nsounds.  Her mother had been trying without success\nfor years to get that girl interested in music, but\nthe next day her father asked me ""Now, how much is a\nviolin going to cost me?"".  She was a bright girl:\nShe was at a large, very competitive high school,\nthe pride of the community, and in her senior year\nher parents were surprised to discover that she was\nby a wide margin the head of her class.  She got\nValedictorian.  In college the retraced the steps of\nmy wife and got PBK.  She got her LLB at Harvard and\nstarted at Cravath, Swaine & Moore.  Bright girl.<p>So, net, really, just do the darned work, and no\ngreat educational startup opportunity.<p>For a reader who got this far and heard of the Bach\n'Chaconne' here for the first time, here's what it\nis:  At one point, Bach wrote six pieces for\nunaccompanied violin (he did the same for cello).\nThree of the pieces he called called 'Sonatas' and\nthe other three, 'Partitas'.  These pieces are\nsecular, unlike his other ecclesiastical music.\nWhile Bach was mostly a keyboard player, especially\nfor organ, his violin and cello pieces show amazing\nknowledge of violin and cello, even if heavily he\ntried to have them play chords more appropriate for\nkeyboards.<p>The crown jewel of the unaccompanied pieces is the\nlast part of the Partita #2 called the 'Chaconne'\nwhich was a old dance form.<p>A lot of the music is trying to play on 3-4 strings\nat once.  Those efforts can view as chords sometimes\nand just more than one melodic line at other times.\nBach was good at doing such things.<p>The piece is in three sections, D-minor, D-major,\nand D-minor again and is a 'theme and variations'.\nThe variations have great variety, slow to fast,\ncalm to agitated, low pitches to high.<p>The D-major section starts off calm.  Soon it is\nplaying some nice arpeggios with some triplets.  The\ntriplets get to be more and more intense, say,\n'insistent'.  The end of the section is essentially\nthe climax of the piece and is the most difficult\nsection to play.  Depending on how it is played and\nheard, the last bars can sound like chords or\nseveral melodic lines, each heard before.  How to\nplay the last few notes is up to the violinist, but\nHeifetz makes a big climax there and then quickly\nmoves to the start of the last D-minor section which\ncan view as some 'cathartic' relief from the\nintensity of the climax at the end of the D-major\nsection.<p>Due to the use of the chords and the relatively\nnon-melodic main theme, for a listener the piece\ntakes some effort to follow well enough to 'like'.<p>What it all 'means' is for the listener to decide.\nBut it does appear that something intense and\ndetermined is going on underneath there somewhere.\nPlaying it is great fun -- parts of it are a great\nway to scream out to the heavens the spirit of\nhumanity or some such.<p>There is an old joke:  At times the piece is played\non guitar.  So, at a concert a guitarist in the\naudience sat waiting for the concert to begin.  With\nnothing else to do, he mentioned to the person next\nto him ""The Bach 'Chaconne' sure is difficult to\nplay.""<p>The next person was composer Castelnuovo-Tedesco,\nknown to be a man of few words, who said nothing\nuntil the concert was over at which time he turned\nto the guitarist and said, ""The Bach 'Chaconne' is\nthe greatest piece of music ever written.""  It's my\nfavorite.<p>Again, the bottleneck in education is the need for\nthe students to do hard work.  Given that, there's\nlots of great music, good violins and pianos,\ntextbooks, CEEB tests, colleges, universities,\nguidance, YouTube videos, etc.  With the hard work,\nwe can soar to the heavens.  Without the hard work,\nwe're stuck in the mud.",1368386510

I would like to see more information about this too.<p>I had an argument with a co-worker about this. The spec is a bit ambiguous about GET requests with bodies.<p>Section 4.3 of RFC 2616 [1] says:<p><pre><code>   A message-body MUST NOT be included in\n   a request if the specification of the request method (section 5.1.1)\n   does not allow sending an entity-body in requests. A server SHOULD\n   read and forward a message-body on any request; if the request method\n   does not include defined semantics for an entity-body, then the\n   message-body SHOULD be ignored when handling the request.\n</code></pre>\nSection 9.3 [2] is the section about GET requests and it never mentions request bodies (they call them entities in section 9) at all.<p>Section 9.8 [3], ""TRACE"" says:<p><pre><code>   A TRACE request MUST NOT include an entity.\n</code></pre>\nSo, 4.3 can be interpreted as: the spec does not disallow it, so it's allowed. But it can also be interpreted as: it isn't explicitly allowed in the GET section, so it isn't allowed. I think the wording is bad enough that it can be interpreted either way, especially because some methods explicitly allow request bodies (PUT, POST) and some explicitly disallow them (TRACE).<p>My personal opinion is that if they meant to disallow bodies in GETs then they would have said ""...does not <i>explicitly</i> allow sending..."" in section 4.3.<p>[1] <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-4.3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-4.3</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-9.3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-9.3</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-9.8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-9.8</a>",1368386462

(Whether you want to use ""good"" or ""bad"" here is up to you)""</i><p>Your reasoning here doesn't make any sense to me, are you claiming that if a student takes out loans in order to pay for an education in basket weaving. Then fails to earn enough money by applying their acquired expertise in basket weaving to repay that loan. That they educational institution was at fault here?<p>There are many colleges which will train you in skills that will pay off the entire cost it takes to attend them in under 5 years. In California alone there are 23 campuses of the California State University system, with a median four year tuition of $25,000 for state residents which will train you in a STEM degree which is less than you would pay for a new car. There are community colleges which will do an Associates degree for even less.<p>But you are absolutely right there is a problem here, it just isn't with the colleges (although there may be grounds for accusing them of collusion).<p>Come at this from a different angle, how would you like to be able to conscript hundreds, thousands, maybe even a million people into a program where some fraction of everything they earn goes right into your pocket? Sell them a government guaranteed loan that they can't afford to pay back. It was a great scam in the Mortgage business for a while, the banks made billions on it, the tax payers took it in the shorts when the bottom fell out. And why did the bottom fall out? Because those damn suckers could declare bankruptcy and get out of paying the loan! Can you imagine. Well the banks have fixed <i>that</i> loop hole, you can't declare bankruptcy and get out of a student loan, no way no how, you're mine <i>for life</i>.<p>And guess what, the same people who were fleecing stupid people with bad mortgages are now fleecing people with student loans. In some cases literally, like when I heard from the same Wells Fargo loan officer who used to do mortgages and now wanted to talk to me about getting loans for my college age kids.<p>Its a problem *for schools"" if they are over priced since they need students to survive. Guess what, if they can't justify their costs they go out of business or they get more efficient. As long as there are people willing to provide the same degree for less money, the system will continue to work and anyone who wants to be a doctor, or an engineer, or a lawyer, or a geologist or whatever can get their degree.<p>I implore you not to let the red herring story of 'students drowning in debt' convince you that college is broken, its not, student lending is broken and students are not be properly informed with respect to what ""a degree"" means versus what an ""employable degree"" means. Once we educate them and they start spreading out to the more affordable schools the private schools will have to fight harder for the top talent and will do so with scholarships so that their 'total cost' is the same as if they went to a state school but got their 'marquee' name.<p>Make students more discerning shoppers and the ""problems"" you decry go away.",1368386199

Even though @jstanley is correct about the latter quote, I do agree that most start-up stories are dominated by these fantastical circumstances and ridiculous buyouts. I think there are primarily two reasons for this:<p>1. Retention (or lack thereof) in the start-up world<p>2. The success bar<p>As far as (1) is concerned, I think why we don't hear about people that try, try, and try some more for many years is that once you reach a certain age or once you have kids, you can no longer afford to live on Ramen noodles and Ritz crackers. If you fail once, twice, or three times, it really is  very very difficult to try again. Even tough you've (hopefully) gained some valuable lessons by failing, you've lost (a perhaps disproportionate amount of) resilience. Thus, you're much less likely to try again.<p>(2) is moreso culture-dominated than rooted in the real world. As far as I'm concerned, I'd consider myself ""successful"" if I launched a 1-person start-up and sold it for mid-to-high 5-figures. That's not even close to ""Facebook successful"" and maybe my success bar has been lowered since I've failed a bunch of times, but most of these books/interviews/talks are written/given by people that have had outstanding exits. No one wants to talk to the tiny 2-man studio that built a company and sold it for $300k (even though I would argue that's a successful exit).",1368385423

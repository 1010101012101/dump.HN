Why shouldn't you pay for a sample at a rate that is not the rate you will be buying the full product.<p>Maybe my specific examples are for a different market (always hard to say where people are writing from: is it the bay area, or a smaller city) but depending on what the developer and company are looking for and their stage of financing, etc, this can enable fits that otherwise just can't happen.  Both of them take a risk (the shop that is non-technical and can't tell who is the right one, the developer who doesn't really want to work for 4 or 8 hours for 160 or 320 dollars) but if they do, it can pay off.  When there is trust I just don't see why this is so bad.  Loads of long relationships form this way (paid at normal market rates or higher - higher, explicitly due to the fact that the client is not in a position to shop around, can't do technical interviews, etc.  Wouldn't you want a client like this?  Where if you prove your ability above their other candidates, they can't find a replacement for you and are going to pay you approaching the ""monopoly price"" - what the business case makes your services worth to them?)",1336391882

In one corner, there's the print staff, in another the web staff. They work in separate systems, follow different workflows and are treated like different P&L centers. Couple that with the very conservative organizations that print papers are and you have a recipe for infighting and 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy'-like power games.<p>There's currently a major push in the industry towards what's generally called the 'convergent newsroom', bringing print and web together under one roof, so you have a 'Sports' department that's in charge of sports regardless of channel. The tablet has in many ways acted as an accelerator in this process, in a roundabout way. When the tablet arrived, as the author noted, the print people relished the opportunity to find a digital way to go back to olden times. On the other hand, the web people saw it as a natural extension to the website. So massive infighting will have occurred at most newsdesks around the world. Since the print people have the most clout in most newsrooms around the globe, they generally won the initial round, which pushed the print people closer to digital. With the failure of early tablet papers (distributing massive, perfectly kerned pdf's to devices), the web people have gotten a shot at it, thus pushing the organizations closer to each other.<p>At the same time, the systems vendors, harrowed by the competition from open source sees the convergent newsroom as the strategy to win; None of Wordpress, Drupal etc can easily produce a website and a printed paper. The tablet has in many ways been a spearhead in getting newspapers to look at buying new systems and redesigning their organization around them, producing tablet, mobile, web and print in one system. So every enterprise sales force in the industry is out there pushing tablet systems like it's the second coming.<p>Newspapers aren't stupid, they're just (1) stuck in old organizational structures, (2) using software that treats different channels as silos, and (3) fraught with unionized contracts that make any change insanely difficult (some contracts stipulate that the editors can only work in specific versions of InDesign, for example). At the same time, they're very clearly on the losing end of the digital disruption as the ad buy withers away from them with nothing to replace it.

3938536,comment,3937871,3937871,1,0,b1daly,,,"A lot of good points, just a couple I thought of:
Software is written to control hardware. In the end that's all a user can use. Computers are a new category of machine, they are super complex, easily reconfigurable general purpose machines. So writing softare doesn't really compare with other trades. In some sense it's like a design, but since the machine is already constructed the building of the particular machine that is the app in practice is trivial (usually, click install). If you compare to building a house,let's say the program is like the complete design. One could design a house that was reused over and over. In some degree this happens (prefab houses). But since the construction costs are high relative to the design, there is usually some room and incentive to customize, just a bit.<p>For a software app, if it's well written, the end product builds itself. The cost of this last step is virtually nothing. Since the design can be used repeatedly, the software development costs can be spread over a lot of end users. For example, take Excel. A ""spreadsheet machine"" is pretty useful, it's complicated. You could compare ""spreadsheet machine"" to a house (or maybe something like a tractor). Aside from tweaking, the software is done, the actual machine (a PC) is a commodity. It's a done deal, anyone who wants a ""spreadsheet machine"" can get one relatively cheaply. But now, since the machines are out there, along with a huge amount of cheaply distributed software (the OS,languages, compilers) everyone is tempted to make something new. How about a multimedia playback machine? Brand  new things that haven't even been made before. Even though there are a bunch of general purpose tools available, it is the ""newness"" of the app that makes it hard to predict how long it will take to code. New problems don't have existing solutions, so no one can predict how long it will take to find them.<p>Also, since the actual machine is super complex, which is necessary for such a general purpose device, there is looseness in the designs, leading to many different ways of doing the same thing and inevitable bugs. There are bugs in the OS, so you are going to have bugs in your app. Think about how much more complex a PC Playing back a DVD is compared to a DVD player.",1336390082

Even the curious visitor speaks of serious things, with hushed voice, and as each whisper reverberates through the vaulted nave, the returning echo seems to bear a message of mystery. The labor of generations of architects and artisans has been forgotten, the scaffolding erected for their toil has long since been removed, their mistakes have been erased, or have
become hidden by the dust of centuries. Seeing only the perfection of the completed whole, we are impressed as by some superhuman agency. But sometimes we enter such an edifice that is still partly under construction; then the sound of hammers, the reek of tobacco, the trivial jests bandied from workman to workman, enable us to realize that these great structures are but the result of giving to ordinary human effort a direction and purpose. Science has its cathedrals, built by the efforts of a few architects and of many workers.""

The cash itself would weigh over 200 pounds. Strictly speaking, it's impossible for someone to walk up to you on the street and simply ""hand"" you <i>a</i> briefcase full of $10M. They would have to wheel them to you on a cart, which would undoubtedly attract far more attention than is safe for this sort of transaction.<p>Incidentally, it's amusing to note that $100 bills are actually more valuable than gold relative to their weight. The obvious next question would be, what's an even denser store of value. For one amusing example, Cristiano Ronaldo has a transfer value in excess of $130 million by last valuation, and weighs less than 200 pounds, making him more than ten times as valuable as $100 bills per unit weight, let alone gold. Judging from the transfer market, it would seem that many top-flight athletes are literally worth their weight in gold.",1336388595

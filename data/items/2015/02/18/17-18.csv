Unless your adversaries are state actors BitLocker on Windows works just fine for both the internal and any removable drives.<p>Yes it&#x27;s not perfect and if you use it and let your devices to go to sleep rather than power off you are vulnerable to various memory access and coldboot attacks.<p>However with TPM/USB Storage for the keys, with secure boot enabled Bitlocker offers one of the better data encryption capabilities out there.<p>Yes MSFT might have backdoored it, TPM is an oxymoron and all that might be true. However if the only thing you are worried about is what happens to your data if your device gets lost or stolen you are probably more than fine with using this setup.<p>If you are worried about the NSA having your files well then probably there isn&#x27;t much you can do about it if they want them they&#x27;ll get them. Whether its by backdooring your OS, internet connection, or by sending intelligence support activity assets to your home to tap into it while you sleep :)",1424282363

Otherwise I typically listen to the same songs on repeat until they have turned into a drone like noise for me to block out the rest of the noise in the world. Sometimes I do appreciate variation in music, and I have spent a lot of time devoted to studying classical music. But still, a particularly well known sonata might as well be a recursively constructed formalism of white noise to me, because that is how I remember the piece. It is beautiful in that regard, but I just do not consider myself educated enough in music to understand anything about it otherwise.<p>I find code and mathematics to be much more delicate, intricate, fundamental; to my own personal comprehension. I remember playing the piano a couple of times to think about how a computer might experience the progression of it&#x27;s thoughts. The thing with creativity is it has no walls.",1424282180

9069804,comment,9066762,9068766,0,0,cookiecaper,,,">@cookiecaper, you&#x27;ve basically ignored the argument.<p>There is no argument. There is only the dogmatic belief that there is some cosmic moral code that states persons must be fired in person. As I&#x27;ve said probably four times now, I accept whole-heartedly there are times when that is the best course of action, and I&#x27;ve acted accordingly and fired these people face-to-face. But I <i>don&#x27;t</i> believe there is a cosmic moral law violated by considering or performing the firing via alternate, asynchronous means. I believe that circumstances can make this a better option sometimes.<p>>Oh, but you can&#x27;t call that a fact, because it fails the verifiability test. I mean, firing is a decision made by management, the same management that placed the company in this position in the first place.<p>This is nitpicking at semantics. I understand that firing is usually a subjective judgment call, obviously. I guess better phrasing would&#x27;ve been &quot;whoever did or didn&#x27;t do things... the decision has been made and needs to be executed&quot;.<p>>Truth be told, I would get pretty mad about such things, but fortunately such companies are usually ran by incompetents and so most of them either go out of business or become completely irrelevant and for me that&#x27;s justice enough.<p>As I alluded elsewhere, I think it is silly to state that the C-levels at all of these big companies are &quot;incompetents&quot; because they don&#x27;t meet with every employee individually to fire them. It&#x27;s a routine way to do mass layoffs and it&#x27;s easy for employees to say &quot;That guy couldn&#x27;t look me in the eye&quot;, but it&#x27;s also easy for employees to find all kinds of other things to complain about. Since your employees are going to be unhappy when they&#x27;re fired anyway, I believe it should be done in the most objectively logical and considerate way, even if it leaves room for petty complaints about the venue, because people who want to complain are going to <i>find something</i> to complain about even if you fire them in the most stately of palaces and most well-pressed of designer suits, with braces that keep your eyelids open so that there is no doubt that you were willing to &quot;look them in the eye&quot; when you fired them.<p>Sometimes there is no good alternative; like others are saying in this thread, it&#x27;s often impossible to concoct a graceful firing experience. Saying that people are incompetent for remote firings is ascribing far too much value to what is ultimately a subjective presentation, and ignoring the serious and real logistical issues sometimes involved with a &quot;look-me-in-the-eye&quot; firing.",1424281345

Like my interpretation of the meaning of &quot;government->state->property&quot; as being a hint at the libertarian leanings of many subreddits, or the connection of &quot;women->reasoning->evidence&quot; as being a hint of many redditors belief that women are illogical liars (which is the impression many of my female friends have of reddit, in general, particularly when topics like date rape or the &quot;friend zone&quot; come up).

We’re making games. We should allow them to go crazy sometimes.<p>This is something I notice as a GM in tabletop games as well, and I think it&#x27;s the same phenomenon. There is a tension between creators and consumers in that the former wants to provide a specific experience but the latter cannot help but to experience things their own way.<p>Every experienced GM knows that players lay to waste the best plans.  They miss clues and items that they needed to progress, while finding unexpected workarounds to problems that should have been more challenging.  They have too little power sometimes, but then find a few good treasures or spells and suddenly have far too much power.<p>Dealing with this tension usually drives towards one of two solutions: either control the experience so tightly that deviation is impossible (railroading) or try desperately to roll with the changes and keep things interesting.  Video games seem to largely take the former solution, probably because it&#x27;s the easiest way.<p>But talk to gamers, and while they&#x27;ll fondly remember a good story or a good game they played, it is the moments of accident where the whole thing derailed that really gets people excited and talking. Gamers like being a little too powerful, going places they weren&#x27;t supposed to be.  Sadly, game designers have gotten very good at conducting their railroads, but have done very little to master the improvisational artform of letting players do what they want, of feeling free and powerful but still keeping a gentle hand on the steering wheel.",1424280197

It&#x27;s only if they survive into high levels that they become demigods. Most of the spells I mentioned aren&#x27;t available till the very end of the game.<p>This makes sense, as mastery of the Weave grants powers that are physically impossible to perform within the world&#x27;s natural laws.<p>Magic by definition is bending/breaking the rules of the universe, and as such it should feel like it if you spend the countless hours needed to master it and persevere to the end. It took me dozens of hours of reading the spell descriptions from scrolls to just understand how spells interacted and worked together. It would have been far easier to say &quot;screw it&quot; and go with a fighter or paladin that focuses on disrupting enemy magic users. But I stuck with it, and am glad I did because using the magic system in BG2 is immensely satisfying. It requires an absurd amount of knowledge and expertise. It rewards future time orientation, patience and planning over impulsive &quot;give me whats best right now&quot;.<p>Fighter and wizard wouldn&#x27;t be very different if they were equally as effective from level 1 to level cap. They&#x27;d just be the same class with different variations of the same skills...which is exactly what happened in WoW.<p>Furthermore, unless you&#x27;re soloing BG2, you have a party of six consisting of a variety of classes. Therefore, you&#x27;d never have to re-roll as a mage, because there would be a mage in your party ready to make up for any magical shortcomings you may have as a fighter. Your role then becomes keeping him safe and taking care of the less magically inclined enemies.<p>The MMOification I mentioned also has this issue of only allowing you the control of one character. This means all characters must be jack-of-all-trades, because otherwise someone will have to be stuck doing the less sexy roles such as tanking, healing or buffing/debuffing. Or in the case of the BG2 wizard, being completely useless for half the game.<p>Multiplayer game design has a long way to go before it reaches the wonders achieved in the past decade in single player games.<p>EDIT: I forgot to mention that enemy wizards also turn all of your strengths against you, because the player does not have any particularly special powers that enemies are denied. In fact, the player is at a far lower level for most of the game than enemies encountered and must rely on wits alone to survive most fights. There&#x27;s a mod (Sword Coast Stratagems) that enhances enemy AI, and it is universally acclaimed as making BG2 into one of the most difficult games in existence. Every fight becomes a high stakes chess match...one small mistake leads to instant death. Aside from Dark/Demon Souls, I don&#x27;t know of any games that come close to this level of tactical difficulty. I find these experiences to be immensely rewarding, and have a hard time playing mainstream games because they seriously lack this element.",1424280009

That audit was completed professionally and efficiently. No smoking gun problems were found (several nits were, but nothing that would make it any easier to decide whether to trust the package).<p>That iSEC audit was the headline achievement for the project, so the fact that it was finished should reassure people worrying about whether the project did anything.<p>After the code audit, the project was supposed to move on to review the cryptography in TC. Which is where I come in.<p>Because the project was considering commissioning services from professional appsec firms, I recused myself from the project (at the time, I worked for a very large appsec firm). My feeling is that a better use of the TC project resources would be to set up some kind of crowdsourced audit slash bug bounty. When the code audit was completed, and after I had left Matasano, I volunteered to coordinate a crowdsourced crypto audit.<p>Unfortunately, I was also in the midst of starting a new company and recruiting cofounders and then the holidays hit and long story short things went off the rails.<p>There are two big paths forward for the TC project that I am aware of:<p>1. They can rekindle the crowdsourced crypto audit (I&#x27;d be happy to remain involved, or to talk to any other subject matter expert that wanted to do that job --- n.b., I was going to do the work <i>gratis</i>). If any kind of formal review of TC&#x27;s cryptography is to be done, this is the way to do it; the project can&#x27;t afford what it costs to retain professional cryptography engineers to review the code (real crypto security consulting costs a multiple of what appsec consulting does).<p>2. They can devote all the remaining funds to a public bug bounty for Truecrypt.<p>There may be options 3 or 4 that I&#x27;m not aware of. I have a decent relationship with Kenn and Matthew, but I have not been trying to keep myself in the loop on the project.<p>There you go: more than you wanted to know about the TC audit project!<p>None of it has much of anything to do with that weird announcement from last year.",1424279861

The transaction between a developer and an app platform is considered a business-to-business transaction and is subject to the existing VAT rules.<p>If an app offers in-app purchases, a developer must consider whether allowing a platform to handle the micro-transactions (thus sacrificing the 30% revenue share) outweighs the time and costs necessary to collect and store sales information (including location) and VAT payments.

9069626,comment,9067377,9068867,0,0,kaoD,,,"As a wannabe musician and beginner jazz player, I feel music is explained all wrong. Unfortunately there&#x27;s a lot of baggage from older eras where music wasn&#x27;t well understood and was mostly a collection of heuristics. The fact that harmony understanding is usually explained in a chronological fashion probably doesn&#x27;t help.<p>The problem (and I guess you know this already) is that although music is analyzable with math, how we experience music isn&#x27;t entirely formalizable.<p>Music <i>isn&#x27;t</i> math, just like physics <i>isn&#x27;t</i> math. Math is just the tool we use to formalize and study them.<p>> Music notation is mostly wrong to me, it doesn&#x27;t explain a lot.<p>Just like words don&#x27;t explain a lot by themselves: their relationships with each other, the whole text, and your tacit knowledge and reasoning do explain far more.<p>Take this chord chart (excerpt from a jazz tune):<p><pre><code>    C6 | F7 F#º7 | C6/G F9 | Em7 A7\n</code></pre>\nIt doesn&#x27;t explain anything itself, but with a bit of analysis (and tacit knowledge) you can see patterns. E.g., there&#x27;s a voice which goes in chromatic ascension and then is held (hinted by the C6 with a G bass and the explicit 9th in F9):<p><pre><code>    C-[E]-G-A                   |\n    [F]-A#-C-Eb  [F#]-A#-C-Eb   |\n    C-E-[G]-A    F-A#-C-Eb-[G]  |\n    E-[G]-B-D    A-C-E-[G]\n</code></pre>\nOr only the ascending voice:<p><pre><code>    E | F F# | G G | G G\n</code></pre>\nBut it can also be seen (and interpreted) as a purely ascending voice (though not chromatic):<p><pre><code>    E | F F# | G A# | B C  (though I&#x27;m not convinced with that G to A# gap)\n</code></pre>\nThat line is found in the chord chart too (check it yourself). Which one is correct? None. And both. And there are many more hidden.<p>It isn&#x27;t obvious, but those relationships are there, and they&#x27;re important, and you&#x27;re supposed to be able to see them with your tacit knowledge (and highlight any of them in your playing <i>if you want to</i>!).<p>Of course it could be explicitly remarked and it sometimes is, specially in classical music or when the composer wants to highlight it himself. But then you lose a lot of what&#x27;s jazz, like how different people view the same standard and express the subtleties as <i>their</i> music.<p>Also, there are so many hidden subtleties that the small chord chart would explode into a huge collection of remarks and explanations (imagine explaining what each word in a story means!) and those would probably differ depending on who did the analysis (like what exactly metaphors and allegories mean in text).<p>And that&#x27;s why you&#x27;ve never found the correct formula: there isn&#x27;t. If Einstein would&#x27;ve sworn by classical mechanics formulas, we would&#x27;ve never had relativity. Knowing those formulas is good though: each of them strengthen your understanding little by little. Einstein wouldn&#x27;t have come up with relativity without classical mechanics.<p>The beauty here is that those relationships work because notes are just multiples of each other. Why do C and C# sound &quot;awful&quot; (unless you intend them to sound like that) played together while C and E (a major 3rd) sound beautiful? Because of their interference pattern:<p>C+C#: <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28sin%28261.63*x%29+%2B+sin%28277.18*x%29%29+from+x%3D0+to+0.5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28sin%28261.63*x%29+%2...</a><p>C+E:  <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28sin%28261.63*x%29+%2B+sin%28329.63*x%29%29+from+x%3D0+to+0.5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28sin%28261.63*x%29+%2...</a><p>Is this math? Yes. Is your brain doing the math? Nope. But the math explains why your brain likes C+E more: their interference pattern is less chaotic (i.e. more harmonic) in the short term. Also, C+C# generates a weird long-term beat frequency[1]. Of course this doesn&#x27;t explain the cognitive part (why does my brain like harmonic interferences?) but you get my point.<p>Do players/composers think about these interference patterns? Nope, because they use music notation, which highlights their properties without the burden of interpreting the sound wave frequencies. I can instantly recognize a major 3rd in C+E, not so much in sin(261.63 * t) + sin(329.63 * t).<p>The musical staff seems weird but it is comfortable too: chords formed with stacked thirds (the classic way of making chords) will always have their notes either on lines or spaces but not both, regardless of whether the thirds are major or minor. The oddball (like a chord with a 9th) really stands out. It also makes it easy to see if a chord is major or minor: three consecutive stacked thirds with a D bass and a # on the second third will be D major (D is minor in the key of C, thus why its second third has to be raised).<p>Sorry for the rambling :P This is what happens to my brain on music.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_%28acoustics%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_%28acoustics%29</a><p>----<p>Did you study jazz theory?

Labour <i>is</i> special because human beings have a special place in any political economy, simply because there wouldn&#x27;t be one without us. But the &quot;binary opposition&quot; he sees as being unique to labour is nonsense, and this would be obvious if the role of &quot;binary oppositions&quot; in his theory didn&#x27;t serve as a major distraction to analysis.<p>Consider for a moment the &quot;binary opposition&quot; between electricity&#x27;s value-creating potential that can never be quantified in advance, and electricity as a quantity that can be sold for a price. A kWhr that goes into a supercomputer to calculate the optimal shape of a machine part creates value of a kind and in amounts that is utterly unlike a kWhr that goes into driving a washing machine at a laundromat.<p>This is precisely the &quot;binary opposition&quot; that Varoufakis touts as being unique to labour. It is nothing of the kind. It was nothing of the kind in the days when a lump of coal could be used to heat a pauper&#x27;s hut or fire a steel mill. All economic inputs have both an unquantifiable-in-advance value-creating capacity and a market value.<p>Humans are fascinated by conflict. Present us with a conflict and it will grab our limited attention, leaving very little over to ask, &quot;Hey, all this sound and fury is kind of signifying nothing.&quot;<p>This is the most important role of &quot;binary oppositions&quot; in Marxism (and its bastard step-child, post-modernist literary analysis.) It uses this simple flaw in our attentional structure to allow people to smuggle claims that would otherwise be obviously false right under our noses.<p>Do capital and labour have somewhat different interests? Sure. Do they have many interests that are also shared, based on their common nature of human beings? Absolutely. This is not a binary opposition. This is an argument for a democratic clearing house where differences are aired and decisions made. There needs to be eternal vigilance that one side or the other (mostly the other) doesn&#x27;t gain undue influence in such a place, but the false belief that the world is dominated by black-and-white &quot;binary oppositions&quot; is completely unhelpful in this enterprise. It sheds no light on our legitimate differences, and trying to fix things up later on by talking about &quot;intersectionality&quot; is a poor patch on a broken analysis.<p>We are not a set of 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s in binary opposition to each other, some with the bit flipped to &quot;labour&quot;, some to &quot;capital&quot;. We are human beings, full of contradictions far more complex and diverse than this ridiculous scientistic reductionism can possibly encompass.",1424279545

It also functions as a proxy server so that I can run Apache+PHP (for phpBB) on the same port 80.

Modern Windows/Linux/BSD are infinitely more complex than MS-DOS was, too. I was just pointing out that the OP&#x27;s elation was misguided.

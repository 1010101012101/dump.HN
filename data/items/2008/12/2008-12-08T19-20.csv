Think about work-place verbal abuses disguised as jest, or parental ""funny"" put-downs spoken to adult children, or when an adult jokes about his/her spouses' performance in intimate situations or lack of financial prowess, or that he/she's ""still chasing that making it big dream"". It could still hurt, even when the subject of teasing realizes that it is meant to be funny.<p>The only thing that changes with age is our ability to laugh at ourselves along with them, or to laugh back, or the ability to distance ourselves from the abuser. The author has taken the acquiring of fight/flight defense mechanisms which comes with age for granted.<p>My other comment on this thread: the luxury of being able to fight is what distinguishes good teasing from bad teasing. Those of us who have ever been teased will know what I mean.",1228766318

390296,comment,389977,390233,0,0,noonespecial,,,"I guess I'm just a watered-down kind of guy.<p>As for a little background. I lived 50 miles outside of DC. On a good day, from there, you could practically see the capital. No broadband. I was informed by the local county government that the cable operator given the franchise contract was technically required to serve my area but opted instead of doing so to pay a small fine each year in order to skip us. The franchise contract renegotiation was only done every 15 years. This likely meant no broadband for us until 2015.<p>The frustrating part was that we could <i>see</i> the places that were served easily from our house. I could just about throw a rock and reach it.<p>Finally we rented <i>another</i> building nearby to use as an office and set up a radio link between the two to bring the broadband in. (About 9 miles)<p>Now I'm sure there are plenty of high minded, well thought out arguments on both sides of the net neutrality issue, and the studies on broadband penetration in the US are surely more than enlightening; But I had to crawl onto my roof in the freezing cold with a yagi and a telescope to get broadband just 50 miles from the nations capital.<p>Does this seem right to you?",1228766200
390295,comment,389401,389617,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"Absolutely!  For Javascript at least, putting the { on the same line as the thing that caused it is pretty much the only rational policy.<p>The weird thing is just how the interpreter handles this:<p><pre><code>    return;
    {
    a: ""foo"";
    }
</code></pre>
That's a null return, a block (not that JS supports block-level scope, so blocks are pointless), a labeled line (line-labels aren't actually used for anything, since there's no GOTO), and on that labeled line, there's a string expression that does nothing.<p>So, this is really like 4 different warts working together, but semicolon insertion is by far the most insidious.<p>Also, liberal use of parens can help prevent semicolon insertion bugs.",1228766171

After becoming fluent in irony and sarcasm, you won't 'experience' that asshole beating you up at recess as 'damaging'?<p>I find it much more likely that the social punishment for being a bully greatly increases as the social structure builds, and it hits critical mass by the time children are 11-12 years old. The bullies then must become more subtle about their actions.<p>I agree that teasing definitely has its benefits, but this author's portrait of teasing as an innocent victim just has me confused.<p>Teasing is an extremely subjective social concept, and the same actions can be either teasing or bullying depending on the situation. If one of my friends comes up behind me and tackles me playfully (I'm a rugby player, so this isn't an uncommon occurrence), that's just an everyday part of life--but if a stranger took me to the ground while I was walking down the street, I wouldn't be so forgiving.<p>It's up to the teasee when teasing becomes bullying, and I think it's a great idea for schools to have policies against bullies.<p>If you enjoy it, it's not stalking, but if it is, you need to be able to get a restraining order.",1228765909

390260,comment,389474,390103,0,0,halo,,,"I was trying to contrast your point-of-view, that you prefer OS X, in contrast to the fact that there's little empirical evidence that OS X is an outright better model or that there's little evidence that lots of people are going out of their way to imitate it. Sorry if that didn't come across very well.<p>My personal opinion is that for every advantage that OS X has via its menubar and dock layout it has an equal disadvantage, so both styles are equal.<p>For example, for the menus at the top gives you the advantage of Fitts' law but makes accessing menus while multitasking and switching between applications and using menus more difficult. Moving from looking at the top of the screen to the window is a further distance, which may make viewing slower. You do get the advantage of a more intuitive MDI applications though.<p>The dock is better for frequently used applications, but it uses more screen space, the locations of applications in the dock shift as you use it and it uses dramatically more space than the quick-launch bar. It also stylistically makes maximisation look rather 'off'.<p>If you solely rely on keyboard navigation, Windows-style is probably better - you can easily load an application without the mouse (especially in Vista), plus you primarily use alt+tab/cmd+tab which means that the menu is largely wasted space. If you use many applications, the Start Menu is likely quicker than using Finder, especially on Vista with its built-in search. Of course, there's Quicksilver and their ilk but that's not standard and similar applications are available cross-platform.<p>Finally, if you believe they're approximately equal, if you're developing a new OS from scratch with no existing users and you have to choose between the two it's probably better to lean to lean towards a Windows-style layout as more people are familiar with it to narrow the learning curve, which would make choosing Windows-style windows as the default a reasonable decision.<p>I'm certainly not saying this was the thought process at all - let's not forget Mac OS X was years from release when the GNOME and KDE projects were started and they were building on top of the paradigms of existing X applications - but it certainly shows that if you were making the decision today choosing the Windows model would still be a reasonable one, and that's excluding the factors involved in changing like alienating the current user-base.",1228765622

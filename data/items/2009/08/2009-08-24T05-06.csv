My solution is for everyone to copy the vote of whichever one of their friends seems like the best voter (most intelligent, unaffiliated, conscientious, etc.)  If someone thinks they are a better voter than all of their friends then they decide who to vote for themselves.  The advantages of this system are twofold:<p>1. On average, better politicians get elected because the voting decisions of society's best-equipped voters are being amplified.<p>2. Only a small part of the population has to bother themselves with following political news.  Since they're such great voters they'll probably do it in much greater depth (reading actual bills and scientific papers; carefully scouring campaign websites instead of believing rumors they hear on TV.)",1251093579

They are in many ways counter to each other.<p>If what we do doesn't have any meaning (i.e. if no one is watching) then we might as well do anything we want.

7521673,comment,7519827,7521558,2,0,pavelrub,,,"Maybe. Formally this is inaccurate as the successor function is not the addition function, and one has to <i>prove</i> that S(S(0))=S(0)+S(0).<p>Edit: it should also be noted that this equality shouldn&#x27;t seem &quot;obvious&quot;: the name &quot;successor&quot; here is misleading, as it automatically links to our everyday understanding of a successor as being &quot;the next number&quot;, in which case it is indeed obvious. But formally it&#x27;s just a meaningless symbol that can be changed to other meaningless symbols by certain meaningless rules. Our everyday life association of (apple) -> S(0), (apple,apple)->S(S(0)) is then a kind of a model for those meaningless things, but from within the formal system - they have no meaning.<p>In general I also do not like the invocation of formal arguments here, I think it misses the point. The bigger issue is that for us humans there is an obvious difference in kind between 1+1=2 and 0^0=1 - this should be obvious. Trying to hide this difference by appealing to different kinds of language trickery and formalism is an indication of doing something wrong, not of discovering anything new. The difference is still there, and we should understand why it&#x27;s there, not force it to disappear (compare to the claim that every human act is egoistic in nature - what information does it really give us about the human nature?).",1396515445

From what I already know:<p>> Not having to constantly keep adding types all over,<p>TypeScript is gradually typed (which means it&#x27;s happy with as little or as much type declarations as you want to give to it) and uses type inference, which reduces amount of needless type declarations even more. Actually, coming from C and later C++ to Python and JavaScript I thought the same as you, that type systems are a complete PITA. I then learned OCaml and I changed my mind: <i>bad, archaic</i> type systems <i>are</i> PITA, but modern and powerful ones are a huge help and incur little cost.<p>> and retains purity of JavaScript<p>That&#x27;s like saying that you&#x27;re not using any Scheme library which implements convenient exception handling and you use bare call/cc instead.<p>Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript is strictly more powerful than most of the class based systems, but it <i>is</i> less convenient to express some common idioms using just what&#x27;s built-in. This is why you&#x27;re going to implement some kind of object and meta-object protocols on top of prototypes sooner or later. It makes sense to agree on a standard way to do it, otherwise you&#x27;re just going to add <i>yet another</i> slightly incompatible object system. I agree that there are many cases where prototypal inheritance is enough, though, and you shouldn&#x27;t use classes by default in JavaScript.<p>> adding types all over and maintaining them over the evolution of code is actually higher<p>I have vastly different experience here. Types tend to make refactoring rather easier than harder. It&#x27;s because when you change a return value or expected argument of some function you don&#x27;t need to grep for all its calls in the codebase - the compiler will tell you. With sufficiently good type system, the compiler will tell you if the new type is compatible with the old one, which makes writing adapters easier. And it all happens on compile time, which means you don&#x27;t need to run your app to test it. I read that TypeScript compilation is slow - that may be, but I bet it&#x27;s comparable to running all the unit tests for a project, for example.<p>> It would have been really great if they had produced cool algorithms that could have inferred types as much as possible and added it as static analysis tool instead of JS extension.<p>Yeah, I agree, I&#x27;d like it too. I remember there being a very cool project from some distinguished JS developer which did just that; it was an editor and a supporting library for checking and validating JS code. I can&#x27;t remember what it was, exactly, though... Help, anyone?<p>> Just because JS doesn&#x27;t have type checking<p>As I said, it&#x27;s not either-or situation. Gradual typing is one thing, contracts are the other. You <i>can</i> have the best of both worlds. After a few years I&#x27;m still amazed with Racket and Typed Racket combo - it&#x27;s exactly the right mixture of compile-time and run-time support for ensuring program correctness and I would like to have something very similar in JS one day. In the meantime, TypeScript is a step in the right direction. I only hope it will continue to evolve after 1.0 release.",1396514439

7521618,comment,7519827,7520575,1,0,doetoe,,,"I agree that your definition is a very natural one, but I think your conclusion is mistaken. Defining a function in the same, set-theoretical terms (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation_of_mathematics_in_set_theory#Functions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation_of_mathematics_i...</a>), a function is a subset of the cartesian product, and the Cartesian product of the empty set with itself is empty.<p>EDIT: I realize that you are right. The Cartesian product of the empty set with itself is empty, but it does have a subset, namely the empty set, which happens to be a function.<p>I&#x27;m not so sure this settles anything though. There is exactly one function 0 -> a for every non-empty set a and there is no function b -> 0 for any non-empty set b. Now you have to decide how to define a function to treat the case 0 -> 0. I&#x27;m no expert in set theory, but I would think this can be defined to be either without getting into any kind of trouble.",1396514329

I need to be sure my mental model of the design is accurate.<p>Also, how are messages routed to the individual microservices?  The author says that each microservice receives a note, and if the note tells it to do something it&#x27;s capable of doing, it returns a result.  So my first instinct is to assume that every message is multicasted to every microservice, and as long as you&#x27;re careful that no two microservices respond to the same type of message, you&#x27;ll always get exactly one result.  (By &quot;multicast&quot; I just mean &quot;every microservice sees every message and has the opportunity to respond to it,&quot; not literal UDP multicasting.  This could be accomplished e.g. by sticking each message into a Redis list, which every microservice reads in its entirety. That would also give you a nice deterministic replay log for debugging purposes.)<p>I&#x27;m also guessing that when a microservice generates a result, it returns that result by e.g. stuffing it into a central Redis server, which is being polled by some other part of the architecture which is waiting for the result.<p>EDIT:  Sorry, I meant, does the above design sound reasonable?  What are some hidden gotchas?  I just came up with it off the top of my head, so it probably isn&#x27;t great.",1396514286

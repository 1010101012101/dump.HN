It'll be interesting to see how it shakes out, but I've got to hope that Google will come out of this in good shape for the sake of Java.  It's unfortunate that Oracle is interpreting Google's implementation of Dalvik and a Java-based system as a direct infringement upon their patents.<p>Android aside, it raises some fairly serious questions around Java's future development as a platform vis a vis the uncertainty recently resolved between Microsoft and the Mono project.  While Microsoft extended their ""Community Promise"" to Mono implementors and users, Oracle seems to be taking the opposite approach to companies developing alternate JVMs and Java-based devices.

If nobody crunched the numbers to find out what the characteristics of the distribution's tail are, then the methodology is sloppy.  If a correction factor was applied but not explicitly mentioned where the value is reported, then the reporting is sloppy.

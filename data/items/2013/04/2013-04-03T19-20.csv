5488643,comment,5487316,5488218,1,0,josh2600,,,"I don't understand how the system behaves more intelligently when the edge routers increase. The core routers random behavior gets worse with the larger load, and increasing the number of intelligent routers doesn't help to solve that problem in any meaningful way.<p>Sorry, correct me if I missed something, but I believe that as the overall volume of system transactions increases (thus necessitating more ""intelligent"" nodes) the volume of random dispersal from the core routers increases as well, which can create situations like what we saw with RapGenius where some requests are 100ms and others are 6500ms (the reason being that random routing is not intelligent and can assign jobs to a node that's completely saturated). Adding more and more intelligent nodes doesn't solve the crux of the issue, which is the random assignment of jobs in the core routers to the ""intelligent"" routers/nodes.<p>This whole situation boils down to this: ""Intelligent routing is hard, so fuck it"" and that's why everyone is pissed off. Heroku could've said ""hey Intelligent routing is hard so we're not doing that anymore"" but instead they just silently deprecated the service. It's a textbook example of how to be a bad service provider.",1365019188

Maybe you can find someone else willing to go over the basics of wealth with you.)<p>If you were to just abandon your land, there is no reason to expect it to belong to you when you come back 100 years later.<p>Instead, say you set up a corporation and hire people to use the money made renting it out to pay for taxes and management on it.  You might still own the land in 100 years.  Or not, if the people you left in charge of it couldn't manage it well enough. But people got to use the land in the meantime, so there was economic activity being assisted by your asset.<p>This would not, of course, give you any claim on any new land that is made, like new landfill in Boston.<p>Bitcoins sitting out on the chain while you are sleep do not provide any benefit to growing the economy. They have not bought any factory equipment. They have not trained any workers. They have not invented any new technology.<p>Any system in which people can end up with the same portion of an economy after sitting both their labor and their capital out on the sidelines for 100 years is fundamentally broken.

There were hundreds upon hundreds of games for NES/Gameboy/DOS/PS that absolutely stunk. The vast majority were rotten, rotten games that were plain unfun from the title screen through to the end credits. I'd happily contend that the opposite is true: that if you go into a GAME store today, the vast majority of games will be at least /ok/. Whilst I don't think it's yet true that the majority of titles are AAA (check the reviews section of your nearest games mag, only a few releases per month are evidently AAA), a declining market for medium-budget games is possibly more of an issue.<p>And what happened to the $5 games? Since 2007 the industry has seen a huge, massive surge in (successful) indie game development, primarily on PC but also distributed digitally on PSN and 360. It's definitely there, alive, strong and very visible. (Sure, they might take more than 2 weeks to make, but not many games can be made in two weeks to contend well on quality).",1365018015

Thus, for cocaine possession, you must (a) intend to possess the substance at issue, and (b) you must know the substance at issue is cocaine.  If intent is not met for both of those factors (aka sub-elements), then intent has not been proven.<p>For SR, it's different.  You must have intended to commit the sexual acts at issue.  However, intent is not required as your knowledge of the age of the other party.  In that sense, SR is strict liability.   But note--many legal scholars and judges are of the opinion that SR as a strict liability crime is unconstitutional.  For CP, the issue, as discussed in another comment, is similar--the intent to possess is a required element, but not knowledge that the possessed content is CP (though some states require intent as to both).",1365017154

However, that's almost beside the point - many customers paid for the product that was advertised/documented and received something completely different. Whether or not it was intentional, it should be remediated rather than painted over.<p>Let's completely <i>ignore</i> the random vs. intelligent routing question for the moment and <i>just</i> talk about the New Relic analytics add-on. Heroku customers were paying ~$40 per month PER DYNO for this service. One of the most compelling things about New Relic is that it not only tracks average request time, but also breaks down this data into its components so developers can see which systems are slowing down their requests. Not only did it fail to report the queueing component, it failed to account for it in the total request time, meaning both values were wrong and basically useless.<p>I don't understand how Heroku can admit that the tools for which their customers paid obscene amounts of money were completely broken for <i>two years straight</i> and yet do nothing about it besides apologize. The fact that most customers did not realize it was broken does not mean it didn't cause real, tangible harm to their businesses.<p>It's hard to draw an analogy here since it's rare to use a product for so long without noticing it's not what you paid for, but I'll try - imagine you lease a car for two years. You can pay $500/month for the standard model with n tons of CO2 emissions/mile, or $800/month for a hybrid model with n/5 tons of emissions. You opt for the more expensive hybrid, but after driving the car around happily for two years, you pop the hood only to find that the company gave you the standard model. After complaining to the company, they apologize and give you the standard model. Wouldn't you expect them to <i>also</i> retroactively refund you $300/month for every month you paid for a product that you didn't receive? Does the fact that this was a genuine mistake, rather than an attempt to defraud, change your expectation for receiving a refund? It certainly wouldn't for me.",1365016538

For C++, someone would say to use some set of abstractions or static analysis tools that confers additional safety that isn't available in the out-of-the-box language.<p>Language level support tends to encourage more consistent usage of something than just depending on vigilance.<p>My metapoint though, is that large code bases are hard to displace, especially if the enduser benefits can be achieved through iteration. Rewriting Gecko from scratch in Rust is a tall order, considering how long it took Gecko and WebKit to get to where they are now. It seems much more likely that WebKit/Gecko can be refactored to get most of the benefits in a much shorter period of time than a rewrite.",1365016499

5488343,comment,5487316,5487872,6,0,jules,,,"Random routing vs fully centralized request routing is a false dichtonomy. Suppose you have 100 nodes, and you have a router that routes randomly to one of those 100 nodes. This works very poorly. Now suppose you have 100 nodes, and you have a router that routes intelligently too one of those 100 nodes, e.g. to the one with the smallest request queue. From a theoretical perspective this works really well but it may be impossible to implement efficiently.<p>The solution is to combine the two approaches. You split the 100 nodes into 10 groups of 10, you route randomly to one of the groups, and then within a group you route intelligently. This works really well. The probability of one of the request queues filling up is astronomically small, because for a request queue to fill up, all 10 request queues in a group have to fill up simultaneously (and as we know from math, the chance that an event with probability p occurs at n places simultaneously is exponentially small in n). Even if you route randomly to 50 groups of 2, that works a lot better than routing randomly to 100 groups of 1 (though obviously not as well as 10 groups of 10). There is a paper about this: <a href=""http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/handbook2001.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/handbook20...</a><p>This is essentially what they are suggesting: run multiple concurrent processes on one dyno. Then the requests are routed randomly to a dyno, but within a dyno the requests are routed intelligently to the concurrent processes running on that dyno. There are two problems with this: (1) dynos have ridiculously low memory so you may not be able to run many (if any) concurrent processes on a single dyno (2) if you have contention for a shared resource on a dyno (e.g. the hard disk) you're back to the old situation. They are partially addressing point (1) by providing dynos with 2x the memory of a normal dyno, which given a Rails app's memory requirements is still very low (you probably have to look hard to find a dedicated server that doesn't have at least 20x as much memory).<p>They could be providing intelligent routing within groups of dynos (say groups of 10) and random routing to each group, but apparently they have decided that this is not worth the effort. Another thing is that apparently their routing is centralized for all their customers. Rapgenius did have what, 150 requests per second? Surely that can even be handled by a single intelligent router if they had a dedicated router per customer that's above a certain size (of course you still have to go to the groups of dynos model once a single customer grows beyond the size that a single intelligent router can handle).",1365016233

Yes, if you're buying a single gumball, the price might be a little high today. But you let me know when gumball machines start taking bitcoins. For anything else, a resolution of +-18 cents is perfectly acceptable.... over any reasonable number of transactions, the round ups and round downs will come out to the same value anyway.",1365015774

The daughter's mom, like me, majored in foreign languages in college, so I'm sending along her question to this community to ask how a high-school-age student might study (self study?) multivariable calculus. What are some possible online resources for studying multivariable calculus? What are some good books on the subject that might allow self-study of multivariable calculus? How could the daughter verify her knowledge and skill for future college placement or other purposes?",1365015733

In less than 20 hours (probably) I'm going to release a gigantic blog post (the 2nd-to-last in my Gervais/MacLeod series; I'm finishing that up because I have technical projects I want to start and will probably be starting a new job soon) that gets into the economics of it.<p>Essentially, convexity pertains to work that's hard and where the maximal possible performance isn't well-defined. Now, Sharpe Ratio (ratio of yield to risk) is an affine exponential that decays as the work gets harder. In other words, it's exponentially favorable for easiness on concave work, but for convex work (no matter how difficult) the yield/risk curve is almost constant.<p>Old, industrial work: favor concavity because the limiting factor is how much capital you have to put at risk. Though convex work has more yield, it's yield-per-risk is unfavorable.<p>If work is concave, we can define ""perfect completion"" (it's a commodity) and machines can be programmed to do it. So they're pushing us out of that. The convex work is all that's left for humans. It won't all be <i>technical</i>; there is convex service work.<p>Financial risk (not smart people with good ideas) <i>was</i> the limiting factor for old-style industrial processes, but all that concave work is being given over to machines by the convex labor of programming them. With convex work in the <i>technological</i> era, the Sharpe Ratio is constant and irrelevant. Your limiting factor, instead, is the time and attention of the highly talented people capable of doing (usually specialized) convex work.<p>Check my blog in about 6-18 hours and there'll be more on this topic than you'd ever want to see.",1365015728

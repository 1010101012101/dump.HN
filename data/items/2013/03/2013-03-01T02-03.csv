Never the less, linux hasplenty of industry standard security measures like IOMMU support, DEP, ASLR, containers, RBAC, seccomp and so on.<p>You can't expect the average user to know what technical countermeasures they need anymore than you can expect them to know what garbage collection or interrupt coalescence strategy suits them best. It's important for folks with domain knowledge and pull requests to look out for them. The only problem in this case is the politicization rooted in hatred of  a version of microsoft that differs considerably from the one that exists today.<p><i>Running as a user and protecting root without running unnecessary services is your first step, after that it's all kind of iffy.</i><p>That's advice from a different era. On the desktop (any flavor) the attack vectors are almost entirely malicious attachements, plugin exploits, browser and supporting library exploits, other random outbound clients and social engineering.<p>While linux isn't a popular target, it is at least as vulnerable to these attacks as the others. And due to design issues in X windows, once you can run client native code it is trivial to sniff credentials from the next elevation event.<p>While it's not infallibile, requiring the rootkit or bootkit to be signed by a CA raises the bar dramatically.",1362106791

You're basically saying as I said before, that the best case scenario is if everyone was some great intellectual. No one disputes that, it's not controversial. But it's not interesting as something that could be made to happen in reality. As well, why is programming so special in this sense?<p>For this cab driver, knowing a little bit of Javascript to be able make SPA blog engine is not enough to do route optimization, fuel efficiency and all this other stuff. You're talking about a renaissance cabbie that knows operations research, physics, and queuing theory and so on.<p>It's not really serious how programming is the special snowflake in this sense.

Sure, if you wish, even let all this public campaigning and incentives be there. I'm fine with it. I will help this hypothetical guy personally if he comes my way. Nothing wrong here.<p>But... You (you, with the coding = literacy idea) are seriously overestimating the masses. I'm not sure why, might be due to some bubble effect. I don't live in SV or anything that resembles it. And my view is that even if you decide to go with the coding = literacy analogy, you will run into trouble because most people are not even literate beyond the absolute basics they can get away with. I'm speaking about professionals, and even a certain ""majority"" of college graduates. I'm speaking about a randomly sampled manager from a medium sized enterprise. Ask this guy to write a single page essay about something he knows about. I'm talking about writing, the kind of literacy we're talking about in the coding = literacy analogy. If you are really in a bubble, you might be surprised that only a minority of people living in the first world can write coherently beyond the length of a twitter update or an SMS. So, I would suggest to find another analogy for your public campaigning if you mean learning coding as in learning to code beyond hello world or fizzbuzz.<p>Another problem: where are those magical people that want to increase productivity? Most professionals I know don't even work most of the time! And they want to get away with the absolute minimum that can still achieve the maximum possible return. This is basic human behaviour. I don't endorse it, and I don't say this is everyone's standart behaviour, so no need to take offense, but I don't think anyone would argue against that what I posit here holds for the majority. Now, you want these people to learn coding to increase their productivity? Good luck. I'm sincerely all for it, and I will even help in ways that I can, excuse my cynicism.",1362105099

We are constantly taking advantage of that, in different ways, when we delegate to the database.<p>And even though we are supposed to have all these business layers and whatnot, I think centralizing logic in a DB is a pretty common practice.<p>So I have been asking myself, is there a significant functional difference between the db doing a callback to the program, versus other methods of interacting with that built-in scheduling engine?<p>My supposition is that in the absence of such a capability, one could always get mostly (or fully) equivalent behavior by some combination of<p>(A) having the app fire queries (and consume their results) asynchronously<p>(B) giving queries some other means of initiating a response, e.g. writing to a table that acts as a message queue.<p>To me it seems like such a transformation wouldn't even change the balance of code between app vs DB all that much, it would just change the calling mechanism, and maybe you need these couple of extra modules to manage your query submissions and asynchronously dequeue stuff.<p>So I admit this qualifies as more than syntactic sugar, but not sure goes much beyond that.  Of course, many prized language features don't go beyond that at all; and calling/concurrency idioms are important.<p>I like the idea of centralizing logic in the DB and I can see how your approach allows this in a much more elegant and straightforward manner.  So I think I get it.  Whether it's a totally new architecture, I dunno...<p>I come out of this thinking if there was a way to improve your article it would perhaps be to avoid the claim that this is allowing us to take advantage of database to ""schedule and run"" whatever business logic is implemented in the db via the highly optimized query processing facilities.  All programs effectively do that in their use of the database, which is why the scheduling capabilities exist in advance of your approach.<p>The core thread of what you are doing/advocating, as I understand it, is something like this.
(a) Centralize business logic in the DB.
(b) Stop being ashamed of it.
(c) Support calling conventions that make it easier.<p>If you made the argument that way, I would have seen it as a slam dunk.

Plus has a much better system where you use a different base email address plus the sub-address rather than your regular address.<p>For example, if my account is ""somebody@gmail.com"" then you use somebody+dropbox@gmail.com. But with yahoo, you pick an alternate, e.g. ""huggybear"", and use that instead (huggybear-dropbox@yahoo.com). That way if a spammer seems the sub-addressed account, they can't send email to huggybear@yahoo.com unless they want to end up on Yahoo's blacklist.<p>I've had a great deal more success with Yahoo's sub-addressing than Google's.",1362103266

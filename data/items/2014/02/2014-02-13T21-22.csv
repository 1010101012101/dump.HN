7234728,comment,7233719,7234397,3,0,sabbatic13,,,"I&#x27;m afraid your knowledge of history is almost completely inaccurate.<p>The &quot;Goths&quot; were just a few dozens Germanic tribes who moved West and conquered territory which was already occupied by Germanic tribes. Now, before the latter Germans started pushing West so hard, ca. 500 BCE, there were Celts in a lot of these regions, but 1) current Celtic populations don&#x27;t show any evidence of &quot;Aboriginal Bread&quot;; 2) Celts are very closely related genetically, culturally, and linguistically to both the Italic and Germanic peoples; 3)the Baltic peoples are Indo-European too. They aren&#x27;t &quot;aborigines,&quot; and certainly not culturally distinct and exemplary of some multi-millenial cultural continuity distinct from the Germans or Celts or Italians or Greeks or Albanians or Iranian or Indo-Aryans...etc. The non-Indo-European and non-Finno-Ugric Neolithic peoples of Europe disappeared under waves of IE and Finno-Ugric immigration everywhere (except possibly for the Basque).<p>The only non-immigrants are people who stayed very near the North shore of the Black Sea, but it&#x27;s nonsense to claim that because they didn&#x27;t move much in 5.5K years, they remembered how to make their ancestral bread, while no one else did. That area itself saw waves of immigrants (both IE and non-IE) and was basically part of the East-West highway, so the opposite scenario is much more likely.<p>Moreover, while the Romans enslaved people from various conquered populations, they did not enslave whole regions or tribes or clans or what have you. Prisoners were taken here and there, but large populations and their cultures were not lost to slavery. In addition, all those Germanic tribes and other conquered peoples _were_ most of the Roman Empire eventually. They didn&#x27;t get enslaved or absorbed, nor did they conform much. They just took over.<p>One might also point out that the Northern and Western European diets never conformed to the Mediterranean.",1392328737

7234726,comment,7234010,7234010,8,0,npcc,,,"Okay, I&#x27;m going to go out on a branch and throw up a strange hypothesis. I don&#x27;t have any stake in the Bitcoin or drug dealing games, apart from generalized anarchistic tendancy:<p>Silk Road 2 was a project set-up by some government agency or gangsters.\nThe overall plan is to eliminate competition and sow uncertainty around both Bitcoin and Silk Road type unregulated markets with anonymous owners.\nThe &quot;transaction malleability&quot; issue is totally unrelated to this event - it&#x27;s not an exploit that can be used to &#x27;steal&#x27; Bitcoins, only to corrupt the blockchain and/or mess with transactions (eg. cause them to fail or end up in limbo).<p>&quot;We were planning on re-launching the new auto-finalize and Dispute Center this past weekend, and our projections of order finalization volume indicated that we would need the community’s full balance in hot storage.&quot; - a silly excuse for such an obvious mistake. No imaginable system would require the <i>entire</i> balance of the community to be stored in such a way, no reasonable systems architect would do this.<p>&quot;The details we have on the hacker are below. Stop at nothing to bring this person to your own definition of justice.\nWe normally do not doxx anyone, and hold user information sacred. But this is an extreme situation affecting our entire community, and all three users who have exploited this vulnerability are very much at risk until they approach us directly to assist with any information.\nDo not reveal any details of the attack. This will jeopardize your reward. Contact us directly.\nIf anyone has purchased or sold to these usernames, expect generous bounties for any information you can contribute which leads to identification.&quot; - hold on, where&#x27;s the evidence? What is he going to do with any information provided by his internet personal army? Why should others do his work for him in tracking these supposed hackers down?<p>&quot;Few hours before the announcement we at DeepDotWeb received a mail saying: &#x27;SilkRoad hacked, 150 BTC stolen, you heard it first from me&#x27; this was sent to us by a reddit user who claimed since yesterday he was going to hack SR and steal the sites money&quot; - Wouldn&#x27;t that just be the perfect cover? Get some small-timers to grab a little and point the finger at them while he makes off with the much larger remainder. Besides, didn&#x27;t this guy just say that he needs help tracking the attackers down? How does he then know enough to attach addresses to particular handles and countries? I admit some unfamiliarity with both Bitcoin and Silk Road/2 here so I hope somebody else can fill me in on this.<p>&quot;It takes the integrity of all of us to push this movement forward. Whoever you are, you still have a chance to act in the interest of helping this community. Keep a percentage, return the rest. Don’t walk away with your fellow freedom fighters’ coins.&quot; - An attempt to insinuate that the &#x27;thief&#x27; is a member of the Bitcoin in-group, alongside the author. An appeal to those already attached to the in-group to &#x27;join&#x27; the author in &#x27;solidarity&#x27; and painting this event as an battle to defend Bitcoin itself. One that was already &#x27;lost&#x27;, I note.<p>&quot;Multi-signature transactions are the only way this community will be protected long-term.&quot; - oh yes, if ditching anonymity by tying identities and transactions together in an easily auditable fashion is &#x27;protection&#x27; in this business.<p>&quot;I should have taken MtGox and Bitstamp’s lead and disabled withdrawals as soon as the malleability issue was reported. I was slow to respond and too skeptical of the possible issue at hand.&quot; - I believe this to be a stretch of the truth, weren&#x27;t the MtGox and Bitstamp shutdowns totally unrelated to this &#x27;exploit&#x27;?<p>&quot;If this financial hardship places you at risk of physical harm, contact me directly and I will do my best to help you with my remaining personal funds.&quot; - Give us all your information and I promise I&#x27;ll send you some money!<p>&quot;Hindsight is already suggesting dozens of ways this could have been prevented, but we must march onward.&quot; - Translation: I just lost a lot of your money, trust me so I can do it again or lose faith in Bitcoin entirely.<p>&quot;In retrospect this was incredibly foolish, and I take full responsibility for this decision. I have failed you as a leader, and am completely devastated by today’s discoveries.&quot; - Awesome, an anonymous guy with nothing to lose takes full responsibility.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear some thoughts on these comments and if anybody is thinking along the same lines?

7234723,comment,7233730,7234592,55,0,morganvachon,,,"This kind of crap is why I left law enforcement after 14 years in it. I was a jailer for a while, and ended up hating myself for witnessing but not being able to stop things like the article author went through. I went from jailer to dispatcher, then terminal operator. Even there, detached as I was from the violence and corruption, I still knew I was supporting it as well. I&#x27;m finally out of that career, working as the sole IT staff for a private company.<p>While I know that there are a lot more good cops than bad cops, there are also, among the good cops, way too many bullies who seemingly don&#x27;t even realize what they are doing. They are generally good, family oriented, helpful people, but they are trained in the POST (Peace Officer Standards and Training) classes to never, ever trust the citizen. That mistrust bleeds over into their personality and they sometimes don&#x27;t even realize they have become jerks and bullies. I&#x27;m not defending them; it&#x27;s just been my observation that while the job does attract a certain bad element (low to average intelligence combined with laziness and a lust for authority), it also attracts those who want to do good but end up warped into becoming oppressors despite their good intentions.<p>And there are a few truly good cops who would prevent something like what we read escalating like it did. They do exist, but they generally don&#x27;t last very long in that line of work, because they can&#x27;t take the constant pressure to be part of the team and cover up the bullshit.",1392328697

Walking up to strangers and demanding that they say what they &quot;are&quot; is not one of them.<p>But note that in both of your forks, you&#x27;re trying to place somebody in a box in your head. In the first, bewilderment, you are uncomfortable because somebody fails to conform to your existing boxes. You may have a much more interesting and nuanced set of boxes than the average person. You may be much more polite than the boneheads I&#x27;m describing. You also surely understand that those boxes are a pretty artificial construct, and that it&#x27;s not the job of people on the street to help you improve your set of boxes.

They are two completely different areas of science ...<p>First, mental health professionals disagree with you -- the DSM is the standard guide for all mental health diagnosis in the U.S. and to some extent elsewhere, in both psychiatry and psychology.<p>Second, neither psychiatry nor psychology are scientific enterprises, <i>as you have just proven</i>.<p>What do I mean? Let&#x27;s look at a real science -- physics. Within physics there are any number of specialties -- let&#x27;s look at two: cosmology and particle physics. Cosmologists study nature at the largest scale -- the entire universe. Particle physicists study nature at the smallest scale -- below the size of atoms.<p>But, notwithstanding this apparent difference in focus, cosmologists and particle physicists recognize their respective fields as both grounded in physics, and they productively attend each other&#x27;s conferences. These two specialties are united by (a) science, and (b) a common desire to understand nature.<p>Psychiatrists and psychologists, although apparently specialties in the same field (human psychology), insist (as you now insist) that they&#x27;re not related. And they&#x27;re right -- the reason they&#x27;re not related is because human psychology offers no central corpus of scientific theory to join them together, in the way that the standard model joins cosmology and particle physics, and in the way that the theories of evolution, natural selection and cell biology unite biology and medicine.<p>If human psychology were a science, psychiatrists and psychologists would endeavor to explain what they are satisfied to describe, these fields would be joined by reliable scientific results and theories, and the DSM would not be rejected by thinking people everywhere, including the director of the NIMH, who recently ruled that the DSM may no longer be accepted as the basis of scientific research proposals, for the simple reason that it has no scientific content.<p>> I know a tremendous amount about this topic ...<p>All except the single most important thing to know -- psychiatry and psychology are not sciences -- they&#x27;re primarily steered by anecdote and belief.<p>> Psychiatry, however, IMO, is for the most part, useless.<p>How typical. Need I tell you that psychiatrists say the same thing about psychologists?<p>> Another big problem is that &quot;depression&quot; is such a fuzzy label ...<p>This is why the world is moving on from psychiatry and psychology, toward neuroscience, where (among other things) deep brain stimulation is showing very promising results where psychological treatments have failed.",1392328339

In that case, the library cannot give free software any particular advantage, so it is better to use the Lesser GPL for that library.<p>>This is why we used the Lesser GPL for the GNU C library. After all, there are plenty of other C libraries; using the GPL for ours would have driven proprietary software developers to use another—no problem for them, only for us.<p>>However, when a library provides a significant unique capability, like GNU Readline, that&#x27;s a horse of a different color. The Readline library implements input editing and history for interactive programs, and that&#x27;s a facility not generally available elsewhere. Releasing it under the GPL and limiting its use to free programs gives our community a real boost. At least one application program is free software today specifically because that was necessary for using Readline.",1392327809

And not all mainstream financial transactions are reversible - short term bank to bank loans, which can run in the tens of millions of dollars over periods of mere minutes, are not reversible within the transaction process itself (set up another transaction to balance the books if necessary). Of course, this is hardly a realm for consumers! Only a rarified few that have passed stringent regulatory requirements can participate in high-end mechanisms, and they can be booted out easily in case of fraud or failure.<p>Irreversible, unregulated, software-driven money at the consumer level is a thief&#x27;s wet dream. It&#x27;s even more appealing than cash. Money can be stolen from halfway across the globe, anonymously. Digital currencies face security challenges that go far beyond those of the fiat currency so many people despise.<p>Besides the theft problem, there&#x27;s the crime problem. Digital currency is extremely convenient for high-dollar criminals like international drug and arms dealers. They&#x27;re the first big customers, while mainstream businesses lag far, far behind in their own cautious way. This makes governments even more hostile, and civilians as well. And a currency that isn&#x27;t accepted by the vast majority of legitimate businesses is not terribly useful.<p>But to your other point... yeah, banking software is not necessarily a paragon of security, any more than any other big enterprise software. But consumer-facing parts are generally fairly limited in scope (worst breach I know of is the recent Target breach), and the really big-money parts are hidden well away from the world and buried under many layers of process as well as software security.",1392327322

7234425,comment,7233544,7234138,8,0,rayiner,,,"The chipping away at state sovereignty happened because states kept using that sovereignty to oppress black people. The post-Civil War amendments were a huge smack down, because they set the stage for binding the states to the Bill of Rights, which had previously only applied to the federal government. That had a big impact not because states couldn&#x27;t say violate the freedom of speech anymore. States already had similar clauses in their own Constitutions. No, the real significance of that was it elevated the federal courts to a position of supervising state compliance with federal rights.<p>From there, Supreme Court precedent told the states they couldn&#x27;t keep blacks from voting, couldn&#x27;t segregate them, couldn&#x27;t ban interracial marriage, etc. Every time the states tried to oppress this or that group, they put their sovereignty on the line and the Supreme Court took some of it away. Consider when the governor of Alabama, George Wallace, took a stand against federal court ordered desegregation of the University of Alabama. President LBJ sent federal troops down to Alabama to enforce integration. From a state autonomy standpoint, it was a huge blow, as the federal government asserted its supremacy. The governor of Alabama was forced to step aside on the property of a state university as National Guardsmen escorted black students inside against his will and that of Alabama voters: <a href=""http://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/race/061263race-ra.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/race/061263race...</a>. This continued through the 1960&#x27;s and 1970&#x27;s. The state courts were put in their place when the federal courts started aggressively supervising their procedures, to deal with their tendency to fail to give fair trials to black defendants.<p>Federalism is dead because the states pissed away all of their political capital trying to oppress people.",1392326270

He did well in several of the caucuses.<p>Watching Ron run for president opened my eyes to the vote corruption that takes place in our country. Especially in the caucasus.<p>One example I recall is how Ron was clearly going to win a caucus and so the majority of the other republicans decided to group together so that votes could vote for a coalition instead of letting Ron win. That was strange. (This was in 2008, I forget the state).<p>Then, in Nevada, where Paul won the majority of the delegates, Romney supporters formed their own state party, called “Team Nevada”. The RNC then bypassed the official state party in order to organize for Romney and send all funds to Team Nevada.<p>In Maine, they cancelled the vote due to a snowstorm, when only 84% of the votes were counted and Romney was leading by 200 votes. Of course, they never counted Washington county, which was Paul&#x27;s strongest in 2008.<p>The point is, the corruption is never ending. For that reason, you really have no idea how many people support Ron Paul (and the ideas of the constitution) if you are guessing from votes and media reports.<p>In fact, perhaps spending a lot of time around Paul, Romney conceeds several times that Ron Paul is actually popular.\n<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1JWMr5cVk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1JWMr5cVk</a>",1392325347

The way I have been treated socially is a big part of why I am often suicidal. I have cystic fibrosis, as does my oldest son. We have figured out how to get well when everyone claims it cannot be done. The world would like us to politely die so doctors and others can feel like they know what they are talking about. I am currently deeply in debt and homeless. I can get almost no one to take me seriously. I feel a bit like Galileo, a prisoner and shunned for speaking the truth about an important discovery. It is the kind of thing other people get Nobel prizes for. But I am an outcast and the world is very content with condemning me to death and putting up obstacles at every turn. So, that is a big part of why I often feel like &quot;what is the point?&quot;<p>I perhaps made a mistake in returning to HN. I really do not feel welcome here. Plenty of wealthy, influential people here have attacked me or otherwise behaved in a malicious fashion towards me. In the past, it has been okay for people to pillory me here. The community did not care if I got the crap kicked out of me. The rules about &quot;respecting&quot; others and not engaging in personal attacks apparently do not apply so as to protect me. This is hardly unique to HN. It is pretty normal in most online settings.<p>I am clear that part of the reason for that is that people who are very ill or who have loved ones who are very ill are deeply hurt by the idea that I am getting well when they are not. Trying to share information with them is routinely interpreted as making them look stupid and shaming them, even in cases where the ill person still lives and could yet be helped.<p>So I have spent a lot of years wrestling with how to diplomatically talk about hard subjects, my health being just one of them. And long experience informs me that speaking of this issue in a manner which could make the OP feel somehow at fault for his brother&#x27;s death cannot bring his brother back but can do all kinds of harm to him and others involved in the situation.<p>I am unwilling to suggest that the OP could or should have done x, y, or z differently and then his brother &quot;would&quot; still be alive. We do not know the particulars of this case and that is the worst kind of Monday night quarterbacking imaginable.<p>I hope the OP&#x27;s intent to have his brother&#x27;s death not be in vain serves to get people talking and helps others. It is too late to help his brother. It is not too late to do serious damage to him and others by how we talk about this.<p>Anyway, I have a headache.

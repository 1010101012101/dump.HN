At grocery stores you basically have to use a club card to get the same prices you could have gotten if the store didn't have a club card. If you're an early adopter you can get good deals for a while, but as the number of customers in the program approaches critical mass, the benefit to each customer from having volunteered their information diminishes, and by then the Nash equilibrium is for everybody to be in the program. There's probably a name for this situation but I've forgotten it.

The sleep-when-you-die drive it magnified only got stronger.<p>Compared to what we're building now with our new team, the current buggy beta is more of a tech demo, but I would love to know what you all think of it.<p>I live in a Noisebridge hackerspace-adjacent hacker house full of team members and cofounders of mine and from other startups YC and otherwise.<p>We're compared to Code Academy, which is similar to a feature we were close to releasing at the same time. I was bothered at first by a competitor. I liked their design. But it was crystal clear: Code Hero is not just a web app. We do something that has never been done before for a gamer audience that is 98% of young people. Code Hero turns gamers into coders. Games started 86% of my hacker friends on the coding path. Our metric is programmerization.<p>Code is the new literacy. We work on the same team promoting that. Anybody who encourages code and science literacy is an ally. Code Hero has a built-in web browser for WYSIWYG editing and API referencing that could feature web-based educational tools in an upcoming version.<p>I'd love to hear from Code Academy's founders and others in this space who want to talk about our shared cause and the many possible approaches to it.<p>Most of all I'd like to hear from you what you think of Code Hero as a game. We're aware of 0.192's flaws given that it is still just a prototype compared to what the team is building next, but you can play it and see from our plans on the Kickstarter where we're going with this: Portal-style puzzle learning, Minecraft-style sandbox creativity and Code Hero-style things that have never been done before.<p>Alex Peake

I especially welcome any thoughts in areas where Windows is perceived stronger as a server-side operating system, because I can't think of any. Are there any startups here building on Windows Server? I know this shouldn't be a big deal, but I can't shake off the feeling that it is.<p><pre><code>    Flexibility (Unix +1)
        Unix can be installed on more types of computers
        In future, this could be something as
                small as a watch
                large as a supercomputer
                sophisticated as a robot
                innovative as a new CPU
    
    Scalability (Unix +1)
        Managing 100 servers would be
            easy using Unix
                Can SSH into systems quickly via terminal
                    Could even automate this process
                        As it's completely text-driven
            kludgy using Windows
                would require using remote desktop
                    is automating from outside even possible?
    
    Aims (Unix +1)
        Linux
            Benefits everyone involved
        Windows
            To increase shareholder value for Microsoft
    
    Accessibility (Unix +1)
        Windows is closed system
            Have to fit solution around OS
        Linux is an open system
            Can fit OS around solution
    
    People (Unix +1)
        Most people working on
            Windows Server do it primarily for the money
                Windows people can usually not comfortable with Unix
                    Use Windows because they have to/told to
            Unix do it primarily because they want to
                Unix people can usually comfortable with either
                    And choose to use Unix
    
    Notebook/Desktop Hardware (Unix +1)
        Windows
            Decent hardware (ThinkPad/Dell) and client OS experience (Windows 7)
                Can target .NET or JVM with this
                Ideal for targetting Windows Server
                Not ideal for Unix (no native terminal)
                    This is not acceptable (restricts freedom to target other systems)
                    Can use cygwin but this is a 2nd class option
    
        Unix
            Best designed hardware and client OS experience (Apple)
                In my experience better designed than any Windows options
                Can target JVM with this
                Ideal for targetting Unix (tabbed terminal/shell built-in)
                Cannot target Windows
                    This is acceptable (does not restrict freedom to target other systems)
                
    Dependency (Unix +1)
        If Microsoft goes down
            Entire server stack will be left unsupported and frozen
                Expensive migration to Unix or other platform
                All invested time goes to waste
        If Unix ecosystem goes down
            Impossible situation
                There will always be a Unix ecosystem
                    Has already exist around 50 years
    
    Timelessness (Unix +1)
        Skills learned 20 years on Unix are still relevant today
           Not the case for Windows!
        10 years from now
            Windows will likely require learning of many new things
                Windows 2008 is very different from Windows NT
            Unix will operate with knowledge of most of the same things
                Linux of 2012 command line identical to Linux 2002 one
    
    Philosophy (Unix +1)
        Unix design's openness lends itself to socratic method
            Every decision can be defended/attacked
                Encourages thinking about what is going on
                    Strengthens understanding
        Windows design's closedness lends to closed thinking
            Design decisions unknown/private mostly
                Discourages thinking about what is going on
                    Weakens understanding</code></pre>",1329440581

An autogenerated reply that I should ""simply"" visit their web page seems to imply that they consider their time more valuable than mine. Is this another case where they've done the math and concluded that it would be too labor intensive for them to do the right thing, or are people in corporate marketing departments genuinely unaware of the impression they're making? I'd be grateful to anyone on HN in a position to satisfy my curiosity about this question.",1329440490

I'm fine with it, and I don't see it going in a direction that makes me uncomfortable.<p>I knew Target and other stores were tracking me with my credit card, I noticed it specifically with Target too. At one retail chain I made my first purchase there with a debit card, almost immediately I started getting discount cards in the mail. I can't say for sure how they correlated me to my physical address, but I can guess. They were part of a larger company with other chains, one of which I purchased something from online, using the same debit card.<p>People seem spooked out by Target using credit cards to track people, what about not using credit cards? Safeway uses Club Cards, and they to it totally in the open by giving people ""Just for U"" coupons on things they buy (I used two of them yesterday). I'm not at all bothered that Safeway gives me a coupon on the exact laundry detergent I always buy, I think it's pretty nice of them.",1329440436

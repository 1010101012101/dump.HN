I want to make that easier for you.<p>Nearly all of the Meteor code is broken out into various packages.  They implement components like publish/subscribe, client-side data caching and snapshotting, reliable remote method invocation, live page updates, and hot code push.  They're the building blocks for a rich client application.<p>Now, we have some work to do on better separating those components so that you can pick and choose the parts you want, like using livedata (publish/subscribe) with Angular, or using Spark (our reactive page update engine) with a legacy REST endpoint instead of livedata.  Those combinations are technically possible today, but not particularly accessible.  They should be.<p>(That is one of the two front-burner project we have going today.  The other is scaling.)",1357340312

Safes wouldn't be secure at all without the vigilance of bank employees, etc.<p>With a Firewire device to DMA the password, all you need is to hook up the device long enough to copy all of active memory. Certainly something that could happen at a hackerspace or at a conference.

My impression is that more games are released first on iOS and then later Android (or not at all).<p>Others have complained that the average quality of apps on iOS seem to be higher than the average on Android. That's changing but it was certainly true a year ago. It's less true now.<p>The UX on iOS is still superior IMO to Android. I guess that's far more subjective. Some people like the back button on Android. I hate it since it's impossible to know where it's going to go.<p><a href=""http://www.androidpolice.com/2012/09/18/ux-things-i-hate-about-android/#i-never-have-any-idea-what-the-back-button-will-do"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.androidpolice.com/2012/09/18/ux-things-i-hate-abo...</a><p>Apparently they've been working on fixing that<p><a href=""http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/navigation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/navigation.html</a><p>but they require apps to do the right thing (insert fake history so pressing back in one screen always takes you to the same screen). That means there will always be apps that don't follow the rules. iOS doesn't have this issue because it doesn't have a back button.<p>That's just one example. There's more on that page. The Android team says they are 1/3rd the way there. Not sure how many versions until they are all the way there but I'm definitely looking forward to it.<p>There's a few issues I'm not sure will ever get fixed. The virtual (home/back/task) buttons really get in the way on games. Playing a game, at least an action game, my fingers slide all over the place. With the current iPhone design it's very unlikely to press the home button by accident but not so on Android (or at least not so for me). I'm sure some players have no problems.<p>There's a huge accessory market for iOS. Battery cases, Camera cases (lenses), stereos, 20x the case styles. I really wish Google would define some kind of standard for Android docks. iPhone5 broke all of this but I'm sure the market is catching up quick. Of course this is a fragmentation issue for Android but I'm sure someone creative could come up with a solution.<p>I'm sure there's a few others but that's the few that popped into my head.",1357340043

5010436,comment,5010260,5010260,17,0,nirvana,,,"There's a tendency in the ""tech"" press to focus on a very narrow idea of ""share"".  When they say ""market share"" they are almost always talking about new unit sales.  This is because it's a lot cheaper to just take reports from companies that issue them (as press releases) and then write up a story from that... and these companies are analyzing only the most recent sales (for the most party.)<p>Actual market share is something quite different, as it includes all of the previously sold, but still operating devices.<p>The share relevant to developers is still another matter, as it must take into account the operating system the developer is targetting and how many devices still in use are using that operating system.<p>So, if you're a developer for high end mobile games, you might require Android Jelly Bean and iOS 6.  Thus the question of where to direct your resources would best be answered by ""What is the addressable market size for these two operating systems?""<p>I don't know the answer to that, but too often the torrent of shallow media news talking about ""Share"" that only talks about the current sales is taken as some sort of relevant long term value.<p>It's like saying Las Vegas is cold because you took the temperature one day in January.

But then we got sued by IBM for violating the ""RISC patent"" - a patent that essentially said ""if you make something simpler, it'll go faster"". Seemed like a blindingly obvious notion that shouldn't have been patentable, but we got sued, and lost. The penalty was huge. Nearly put us out of business. We survived, but to help protect us from future suits we went on a patenting binge. Even though we had a basic distaste for patents, the game is what it is, and patents are essential in modern corporations, if only as a defensive measure.

As far as I'm concerned, Meteor is a big ""Screw everything that exist, it sucks. We're better and we've got the time and money to re-build all the life from scratch"".<p>So, in a way, that's <i>great</i>! An mental orgasm for any nerds out there. But in the real life when shit needs to get done, I'm still using <i>everything else that sucks</i>.<p>Now, before people start saying I don't know what I'm talking about, here are a few examples:
 - It does NOT use npm (!) -> Basically, you can't use anything without first converting it to Meteor. 
 - It does NOT use Express (Or connect) as its base -> Basically, the standard in the Node community. That means I can't just plug-in the 20 or so awesome plugins built explicitly to be used by any kinds of node application that support connect.js
 - The current Asynchronous (following node's philosophy) wasn't good enough for them; so the re-created a whole new Mongo version acting synchronously.<p>But most importantly, it's just extremely annoying to hack with it. It's like a big black box.. you're not very sure what it does and you hope it works. But when it's not working, you can't just hack it your way or read the source. It's a little bit like Django or Rails (but in worst) as you <i>can</i> use SQLAlchemy in Django, or you <i>can</i> use different template engines, but then no project from the django community will work with your app.<p>The good news is, the meteor team is working hard. Maybe in a couple years it will be stable enough and iterated fast enough to provide a platform where it will be fun hacking and building web apps. But for now, I sadly prefer to stay in the ""Everything else sucks"" world and hack my way in the node jungle.<p>(For those interested, I have also tried Derby. As said in the article, it's not yet fully stable and the documentation is really Meh. <i>But</i> I think it's going to be big really soon and I'll be more than happy to give it another fair try.

It also makes it very easy to swap functionality in and out without affecting other parts of the app.<p>- two-way data-binding: most of the pain of being a javascript developer comes from managing and manipulating the DOM. After using angular, there is no way I will ever use a framework that doesn't automate this tedium by providing two-way live data-binding (knockout, meteor, and ember all do this). The best part about having less DOM manipulation code is that it makes writing automated tests easier and makes those test much less brittle.<p>- extending HTML: this is often a main complaint of angular. People say that directives ""pollute the DOM"" which I find to be a strange complaint, given that HTML is a declarative (sometimes) semantic language to begin with. HTML5 added a ton of new attributes and features yet nobody complained that these new tags were ""polluting HTML"". Angular simply allows you to extend HTML's functionality even further, and in doing so it makes it very easy to understand what an HTML template is trying to do without having to dig through any JS code.<p>- testing: the angular team made testability a priority, which I was something I always really appreciated about the Rails team. If you're not writing tests for your javascript code, you need to start. Having full test coverage in both end-to-end tests and unit tests has been a major source of stability for me and my team.",1357337546

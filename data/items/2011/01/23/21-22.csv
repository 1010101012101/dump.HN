For e.g., you could split the lines of access-log file into IP addresses and size of requests and fork off separate processing threads: one for obtaining unique set of IP addresses and another for summing up.<p>It seems like all that is needed for describing a pipeline is:<p><pre><code>  (a) a queue for input\n  (b) a processing program that's connected to the queue\n  (c) (possibly multiple) queues for output\n  (d) a topology connecting the processing programs\n  (e) a job scheduler.\n</code></pre>\nAt the face of it, it looks similar to Apple's Automator and Matt Welsh's PhD thesis on SEDA:<p><pre><code>  * http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~mdw/proj/seda/\n  * Paper: http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~mdw/papers/seda-sosp01.pdf\n</code></pre>\nEDIT: Formatting",1295819951

Florian joined Monty of MySQL in opposing the sale, citing as one of the reasons that because MySQL was under GPLv2 only Oracle would be able to fund MySQL development by selling proprietary licenses (MySQL's business model). The theory is that to make a viable fork of MySQL should Oracle turn out to be bad, you needed to be able to sell proprietary licenses to fund development. (RMS criticized the proposed sale on similar grounds).<p>Groklaw decided that this was FUD against GPL (and hand waved away RMS's similar view), and then brought up the Munich Linux migration to show Florian is an evil anti-FOSS person. For those who don't remember that, Florian and other anti-software patent activists, along with the Green Party, wrote a letter to Munich officials raising the issue of potential software patent problems in free software. Their aim was for this to slightly disrupt the project enough for the press to take notice and write about the dangers of software patents.<p>It in fact did disrupt the project. The Munich Linux migration was put on hold for a week while patents were discussed, and the press picked up on it. Some people decided that since Microsoft would obviously like Munich to stick with Windows, Florian must have been working for Microsoft, and the anti-Florian FUD has been flowing ever since.<p>The next thing Florian did that ticked off Groklaw is criticize IBM. Groklaw seems to have a soft spot in its heart for IBM, so criticizing them is not welcome there.<p>PS: The Munich Linux migration is a top contender for worst-managed software migration of all time. That one week delay Florian caused in order to get publicity for the dangers of software patents is a drop in the bucket compared to the massive schedule slips that followed.

We've made the API self-documenting to an extent and that's good. But there's no substitute for actual documentation, of course. And an API is not its documentation. Functionally, it's the same interface, but with ""comments"" of a sort.<p>If we're enabling a client to follow those links then what we're actually doing is forcing the client to make two requests on every operation: one to look up which URI to use, and then another to make the actual request. Also, the client has to be smart enough to figure out which URI it wants to use for the actual request, which takes extra work for the client developer (gotta parse that XML for the <link> with rel=""/linkrels/entry/newcomment""). And, ideally, smart enough to expose any new <link>s which have become available.

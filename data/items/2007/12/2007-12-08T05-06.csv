And I really think it will be something a lot of people will find very useful, so I'm excited about finishing it (it's about 1/3 done).<p>I'm wondering though, how do I legally and officially create a company to back my startup? What steps should I take after creating my company, to make sure everything goes well? Also, does anyone have any tips for this kind of thing?<p>Thanks to everyone who helps me out.",1197091360

""They're babes in the woods. I think I can help turn Alvy and Ed into businessmen.""
-- On Pixar co-founders Alvy Ray Smith and Ed Catmull, in Time, Sept. 1, 1986<p>Well, he certainly succeeded at that. I really think Ed Catmull is one of the world's best examples of pure hacker/nerds becoming great businessmen because of their technical expertise. Organizations and software are very similar, it's no coincidence that the most successful tech companies are run by technologists.

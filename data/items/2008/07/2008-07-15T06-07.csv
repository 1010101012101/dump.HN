You know, just sayin'.<p>I guess it would be useful if you don't have a printer, but then shipping, etc. would make it kind of pointless, with the obvious exception of books (or other documents) on Scribd that have a certain production specificity.",1216104945

The various blogs hosted on the ffmpeg website (multimedia.cx) are great examples of this.  Though I do find that in periods of time when I actually have a lot of work, I don't have time to post much in terms of updates--or at least I justify it that way.",1216102501

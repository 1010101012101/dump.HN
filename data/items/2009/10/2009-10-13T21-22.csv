880186,comment,880186,873176,0,0,dfragnito,,,"Let me clarify my initial comment. The author critiques the notion that the God of the Bible created  a ""natural world"" in which there are mutations and other observed travesties. One would expect, as the author points out, that a world created by God would be perfect. The creation account does in fact describe a creation that was perfect and in complete harmony, physicality and spiritually. When an imperfection (SIN) was introduced into a perfect world everything changed. One could argue if it (the natural world) was perfect how could an imperfection be introduced. This leads into the topic of free will. Could there be a perfect world where there exist no free will? As the account goes free will was part of creation so the imperfection was allowed to be introduced and the rest is history.<p>I am not attempting to  arguing that the creation account is accurate, I am pointing out that the author is not describing the Creation account accurately.<p>It seems to be an effect strategy when trying to win an argument to tell a half truth about the apposing idea or position then attack that idea or position based on the half truth. By truth I mean the ""true"" creation account not the accuracy of the  creation account.<p>I was away for a few days so I could not respond in a more timely manner.<p>On a completely different subject regarding down voting. Does it mean that one does not agree with the content, that the content has no insight, or that the content adds no value? The third is the area that I/We are trying to solve in a web application solution soon to be deployed.<p>Using my initial comment as an example had I not posted that comment what ""value adding""  content would have never been created. If my content resulted in ""value adding"" content is it not then ""value adding"" content? Is a good proxy of ""value adding"" content, content which produces  or causes other content creation?",1255471071

I think the problem with the old guard is the notion that they can make money simply by virtue of their connections.<p>This is something that is embedded in new york finance and business culture. You make connections and get rich by introducing people to one another and taking a cut for the privilege. Thus, investment banks are not really banks in the traditional sense of the word but are more like brokers that connect investors with people that need capital.<p>With the internet, this model will change and is changing. It is not that hard for people to connect and one does not need to pay hefty fees to do it. So the old cliché about the internet cutting out the middleman is actually slowly happening in the world of finance after it happened in the worlds of computer sales, book sales, automobile parts, music sales, etc.<p>I think intermediaries will still be important but they will have to bring more to the table than merely having a fat rolodex.

a) every ""no"" gets you closer to your next ""yes""

c) Expect low conversion rates, e.g. of 100 calls you make less than 10 may accept a short meeting.<p>To make it better, 
a) prepare an elevator pitch to get you started 
b) make sure you have quality leads - e.g. if your customer is the marketing manager, don't pitch to HR or the secretary - make sure you have the right telephone numbers

I'd take a day or two to determine if you can secure warm introductions from friends, acquaintances, advisors, etc into any of these target companies (LinkedIn is a stelar resource for finding these types of intros).  If you can, then you should have a more receptive target which should help you gain some confidence in your own abilities prior to jumping right into the ""cold calls"".<p>Another technique that I've used with some success is to determine the target individual is within a company and try to find their preferred communication channel.  For example, I've gotten some really great contacts by connecting with people first through Twitter or their blogs.  I think this can sometimes cut through the noise of the 100 unsolicited calls they get in a day.<p>You may also want to try sorting your target list by those you think have the most strategic importance.  Then, start calling from the bottom of that list (i.e. the folks who you believe have the least strategic importance) and work your way up.  This will give you the opportunity to work out your pitch/confidence with some lower priority targets.  I've seen some startups try to pitch their most important potential partners right out of the gate and have a bad experience because they haven't had a chance to refine their pitch yet.<p>As far as the message, being straight forward about what you want out of a meeting is definitely the way to go.  Make sure that you also figure out what the benefit is for the potential target.  For example, can you offer them some discount or free trial of your product in exchange for some feedback at this early stage. The actual benefit you can provide to them will obviously vary greatly depending on the type of product you are selling and the type of company you are selling to.<p>Hope this is helpful- good luck!",1255468104

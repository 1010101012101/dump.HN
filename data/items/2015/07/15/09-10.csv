He came to give a seminar to the research center where I was working, and gave a fantastic talk on Perl 6.<p>Late in the evening, I ran into him and his wife on the bus when getting home from work - and started talking to them.  Apparently, nobody from the department had arranged to take them out for dinner, so we ended up going out for dinner together, where we had a fantastic discussion covering religion, tolerance, and lots of other topics.  I am a staunch materialist and atheist, while both the Walls are serious committed Christians, but we had a really pleasant discussion on religion and the nature of evidence.<p>I ended up giving his wife a copy of Hume&#x27;s Dialogue on Natural Religion, and they were kind enough to sign a copy of the Camel book for a friend who is a huge Perl fan.<p>A lot of people know Larry by reputation - but his wife Gloria is just as smart and kind.

So if a user types a space, it does not register and it does not affect the number format.<p>They failed, at the most important part of the form. The correct, i.e. the most user friendly solution is, obviously, to allow spaces (and optionally other characters, like &quot;-,._&quot;) but ignore them when submitting the form.

Using spaces to group digits makes it much easier to check the number after you&#x27;ve entered it (not that it&#x27;s necessary, but I still often do it).<p>Edit: they seem to stick to this failure mode with other inputs as well, e.g. with the postal code input. In almost all circumstances, it&#x27;s better to allow users to enter anything, and give feedback on whether it&#x27;s correct or not (either when the focus moves to the next input, or better yet in realtime when the user is entering information, as long as you make sure that partially entered, potentially correct information is not labelled an error).

On the benchmarking machine used by the PCG author, you would get a ~2.5x speedup over that implementation, which would put Chacha20 roughly at (amortized) 5 cycles per 32-bit word. If you go Chacha8, which is still cryptographically secure, that becomes 2-3 amortized cycles per word. The flagship PCG generator from the paper, &#x27;PCG XSL RR RR 128&#x27;, runs at 1.81 nanoseconds per word on the same machine. This converts to ~6 cycles per word.

9890399,comment,9889152,9890175,0,0,nkoren,,,"Argh, I was just preparing to write a rant about this. No, it is absolutely <i>not</i> true-color -- although this is something which NASA insists on claiming, to its detriment. It annoyed me when they used the same technique to show a &quot;true color&quot; view of the surface of Titan[1], and it&#x27;s annoying me again now.<p>What this image shows is the <i>average</i> color Pluto. The colour information comes from a much lower-resolution image, which was unable to resolve color differences between regions. In truth, Pluto could be wildly multi-colored -- but these kind of images, tagged with the &quot;true color&quot; label, lead you to think that that Pluto (and Titan) are a boring uniform sepia.<p>To understand just how wrong it is to label these images as &quot;true color&quot;, try the following experiment:<p>1: Find a nice colorful picture of, say, a rose garden.<p>2: On a satellite image, find the color-value of that rose garden at, say, a spatial resolution of 50km per pixel.<p>3: Take the color-value of that pixel -- which, on earth, will range from a muddy greyish-brown to a muddy greyish-blue -- and apply that hue to the entire image. You will now have a very sorry-looking rose-garden.<p>4: Release the image accompanied by a press release claiming that this is a &quot;true-color&quot; view of said rose-garden.<p>See the problem with this?<p>Honestly, the folks at NASA are geniuses, but they really need to stop doing this kind of thing. One thing they <i>don&#x27;t</i> understand very well is human perception and psychology. If you show people a greyscale image, they will assume that it represents something which is actually more colorful, and their imagination can take it from there. On the other hand, if you show people an image which is colorised with a uniform color, they will assume that is the actual color -- <i>especially</i> if you&#x27;ve then gone on to <i>tell</i> them that it&#x27;s a true-color image. In truth, it&#x27;s no more &quot;true-color&quot; than the final image in the rose-garden experiment above. This, unfortunately, convinces people that they&#x27;re looking at something far more drab than they actually are.<p>Tl;dr: Where NASA lacks actual color imagery, they really shouldn&#x27;t colorise pictures with a uniform hue and then call them &quot;true color&quot;. It&#x27;s bordering on false to do so, and results in images which are much more drab than a simple black-and-white image would be, and possible <i>much</i> more drab than reality.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon)#/media/File:Huygens_surface_color.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon)#/media/File:Huyge...</a>",1436951956

I know a lot of people who use onenote and office on their devices. Being ubiquitous is the key, not having some technically sophisticated devices that get no consumer uptake.<p>It&#x27;s easy to critique, but <i>tangibly</i> what you suggest as a proactive alternative for them?",1436950902

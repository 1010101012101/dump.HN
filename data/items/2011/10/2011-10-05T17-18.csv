My guess is that your initial pitch didn't make it past the filter. The second time did, but not because you had a ton of offline traction with press and investors, but because you had a referrer who's known to the community - Joshua Baer. Yes, that's a bit of social proof (knowing an entrepreneur who's respected in the community) but not a particularly high bar.

3076712,comment,3076217,3076217,4,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"'Web apps' have had a fantastically valuable feature nearly never mentioned.  If we make big changes in how a Web browser client interacts with a Web server, then we risk getting rid of this fantastically valuable feature and seriously hurting our Web apps and the growth of the Web.<p>I believe that if we don't recognize the fantastically valuable feature, then the rush for 'richer' 'user interfaces' (UIs) and 'better' 'user experiences' (UXs) will get rid of this fantastically valuable feature.<p>Yes, UI/UX are IMPORTANT.  Okay, I accept that.<p>BUT here's the fantastically valuable feature we just MUST retain:  I explain the feature with two examples.<p>First Example -- Microsoft Word<p>While I can't speak for anyone else, I work hard to avoid using Microsoft Word.  Several times I've used it, learned its UI well enough to get my work done, and rushed to f'get about Word and its UI.<p>Instead, for my high quality word whacking, I use D. Knuth's TeX that I find MUCH easier to use.  Why easier?  The documentation is rock solid, a jewel of software documentation.  The software has a 'conceptual model' well explained in the documentation; with this conceptual model, it is fairly easy to understand what is going on.  What TeX does is actually quite reliable and predictable and as explained in the documentation.  Word is DIFFERENT.<p>I hate the Word UI/UX.  For me, for each significant new usage, the UX is sometimes yelling and screaming in frustration.  When I want to do something new to me, there's no solid documentation and no good 'conceptual model' for how Word works.  So, I don't really know how it works.  So, when I want to do something, I go around on the screen and left click, right click, double left click, double right click on everything in sight and see what happens.  Commonly I type in something, get it as I want it, and then for no reason Word just throws away what I did.  After a dozen times of such efforts throwing my work against the wall of Word to see what will stick, I start screaming.  I HATE Word and all of its intended UI/UX.<p>Maybe if I got and read the documentation for how to write macros for Word it would make more sense, but as far as I know I would have to pay for that documentation.  Besides, did I mention, I HATE, deeply, profoundly, bitterly hate and despise, Word?<p>My view is that it takes at least two weeks of full time work for someone to get good facility with Word.<p>Second Example -- 100 Million Web Sites and One Billion Users<p>As we all now know very well, there are something over 100 million Web sites on the Internet and about 1 billion users.  And, nearly any user can use nearly any Web site in their language right away.<p>So, somehow Web apps save the two weeks of full time effort for each of 1 billion users for each of some hundreds of Web sites they might visit.<p>That is, HTML is SIMPLE, DIRT simple.  Nearly all Web apps built with just dirt simple HTML have a fantastically valuable feature:<p><i>Nearly any one of 1 billion users can use the Web app right away.</i><p>The Web app UI/UX has this feature, and Word does not.<p>Why do Web apps have this feature?  Because HTML is DIRT simple.  Yes, commonly there is a round trip to the server for each little step in the user's work.  Right.  So, there's a minimum of subtle, dynamic, pop ups, pull-downs, roll-overs, drag and drops, hidden 'side effects', and big changes in the state of the user's work from small actions.  Not much is hidden or mysterious.  There is minimal need for documentation.  The UI/UX is NOT 'rich' -- thankfully.<p>To layout a page, mostly use just tables and/or divisions and nothing more complicated.  So, the screen presented to the user is relatively simple, easy to understand, and much the same from one Web site to another.  E.g., the designers of Word may have spent some thousands of person-hours designing each little part of each screen.  The resulting complexity is forbidding -- huge BUMMER.  With just simple HTML, it's just not practical to implement such complexity -- THANKFULLY.<p>With just simple HTML, for what we could let a user do, about all we got was (1) to follow a link, click on an image, (2) click on a button, (3) click on some radio buttons, (4) type into a text box, (4) move text to/from the system clipboard, (6) use the key TAB to move the cursor to the next text box, (7) hit the key ENTER in a text box.  SIMPLE.  Over 100 million Web sites have the 'controls' links, buttons, text boxes, etc.; all of these controls work very much the same on all the sites -- TERRIFIC.  When a user clicked on some button, say, ""Submit"" or hit the key ENTER, the data the user entered was sent to the server, and the server responded.  SIMPLE.  Any user with any browser can use nearly any Web app right away.  FANTASTIC.<p>Now, if we work at it, say, with much more powerful client side programming tools, then we will be able to build Web apps with a 'rich' UI/UX.  We can have dynamic this, subtle that, automatic these other things, asynchronous who knows what, guess and anticipate what the user wants and do it for them as a 'favor', drag and drop, overlays, full motion, and on and on.<p>We can have rivers of functionality that are subtle, bug ridden, undocumented, not obvious, and, at each site, unique on all of the Web.  BUMMER.  E.g., I'm still screaming bloody murder at the whole theme of 'icons' because those little images are not English or any natural language, can't be spelled, pronounced, or looked up in a dictionary, and are documented usually at best poorly.  Sickening.  I HATE 'icons'.<p>Then, sorry guys, in practice, nearly all Web apps will (1) be much more expensive to develop, (2) will have many more security problems, (3) will be much less compatible with all the common browsers, (4) will usually become a total pain in the neck to learn to use, and (5) will lose the fantastically valuable feature of ease of use, right away, for any of one billion users.<p>Here's the truth:  The UI should be simple, stay simple, dirt simple.  The work on the server side might be fantastically complicated, but for the user the concepts of what they want, what data they enter, and what data they get back should remain SIMPLE.<p>As it is, HTML is so simple it's tough to mess up the UI.  With much more powerful client side software tools, it will be tough NOT to mess up the UI.<p>Be careful about what you wish for because you might get it.<p>At least be very aware and careful with the fantastically valuable feature of Web apps built with simple HTML.",1317837031

Well, it might just about be coming back to respectability now, but frankly that's after 20 years where for much of that time it was a borderline irrelevant platform.<p>Apple's business, if you look at where they now get their revenues from, is all about phones. How's that sustainable? Short answer, it isn't really. They might have the fashion devices but they only have one of them and it's on a fairly slow refresh cycle. If any of HTC, Samsung, LG or any other of the Android vendors come up with the Next Big Thing in technology fashion, Apple don't have another card to play and the idea that one company in such a competitive market can lead both fashion and technology in perpetuity simply isn't credible. Yet with Apple the only player in their ecosystem, if they stumble the whole ecosystem stalls. If one Android vendor stumbles, another takes their place, the ecosystem keeps going and the vendor has the opportunity to catch up at their next release.<p>Apple might currently have the biggest selection of apps, but with Android fast closing in market share (indeed, looking likely to overtake) and some vendors deciding Apple's policies are too restrictive and switching away from the iOS platform, how long will that stay the case? Once iOS is no longer the dominant platform for app vendors, their more restrictive policies will start seeing the market fall behind its competitors and, just like MacOS, iOS slowly becomes a ghetto with limited software availability.<p>So what are the alternatives? True low-end iPhones? (I can't see a 2+ year old design doing well for very long against newer models in such a fashion-conscious sector.) Not great for Apple; more design and manufacturing expense, more complex supply chains, lower margins and the first-mover profits that Apple are currently enjoying are gone. Quite simply I don't think there's any precedent to suggest it's possible for Apple's current profitability from the iPhone to be maintained, and very little reason to believe its market position is sustainable.",1317835436

I've been waiting until today's Apple event before getting anything. I was ready to be pleasantly surprised.<p>Turns out Apple has just enough market share and momentum to waive their hands around for renewed sales. Why break ground when you can still make great profits off the old stuff?<p>Nano is a software update. Touch has a new color (wowsy!). Phone has speaking app installed, a slightly faster chip. It is new technology at the slowest drip possible. Give me a small ipod with tons of storage. Easy enough, right? Look at the cost of memory these days. You can buy a 32GB SD card for $40. But Apple won't do that. The whole iCloud business looms. The iCloud is just a way to capture and sell you data. So they provide iTunes, integration with everything, then reel in the fishes. They haven't updated the capacity of any of their devices for four years. The ipod nano no longer has a camera, no longer shows videos, has a smaller screen than ever before, and the maximum capacity remains 16GB. But they come in a dazzling array of colors; come and get them while they last!!!<p>Should I wait another 6 months? 12 months?<p>I've thought about getting one of the old nanos, but I'm learning something about the mac I use for work. The computer itself is awesome, even though it is about 7 years old. It is actually faster and more stable than the 64-bit PC I got a few months ago. The thing is, fewer and fewer programs work on it. Google Earth was automatically updated and no longer works. A bunch of other programs are the same. This old architecture (PowerPC) doesn't support any new Adobe products or really any thing else that is new. Even browsers are starting to act weird. But it isn't the hardware, its great. It is that new software doesn't communicate with it anymore.<p>So, I suspect the same will be true with these mac devices. Software will be designed specifically for new devices. So on older devices, either you won't be able to get the newest software or software will be automatically updated and cease to work. For instance, the click wheel now only exists on the ipod classic. Once the classic is discontinued, you can bet that any ipod with a click wheel will start having problems with any new OS. And they update the OS at least once a year. So you can't go back, even if the device remains superior.<p>Welcome to Apple's vision of the future, the - phase it out, throw it away, buy it new - society.",1317834688

If you&#x27;ve studied the music industry then you know that artist compensation - whether a physical sale or digital sale - are equivalent from a practical standpoint. Of a $.99 sale on iTunes, Apple takes the first $.30 for their role, and the rest is at the mercy of label and artist agreements. Whether it was a CD or a digital sale, an artist was only entitled to a certain defined compensation.<p>It&#x27;s kind of funny you mention Craigslist, because you&#x27;re citing it as a reason that the predominant distributors - PRINT DISTRIBUTORS - should not have to compete with a technological innovation with less overhead. It&#x27;s a middle man of the highest order. And you assert they should be propped up because why?<p>Craigslist exploited a loophole of eliminating the friction between seller and buyer without skimming a bunch of revenue in the process. Why are you trying to argue that systems which benefit sellers and buyers should compensate legacy entities which refused to adapt and change? In a digital realm where rights management matters, the only people who argue for additional payout layers are people I don&#x27;t trust.

It could have better battery life, and it would be nice if it didn&#x27;t use lossy compression on the RAWs.  That said, I&#x27;ve never run out of battery or noticed the compression artifacts.  It takes super-sharp pictures of any scene I can throw at it, landscapes, people, the night sky, etc.<p>The AF is not great, I always notice myself wanting a bit more sharpness from shots where I wasn&#x27;t thinking and let the AF do whatever.  If I care I manually focus, and then things are sharp even when looking at 3:1 magnification.  I&#x27;ve tried a friend&#x27;s Nikon D750 and was blown away at how fast the AF was compared to Sony&#x27;s, but I don&#x27;t know how accurate it was.<p>The Zeiss-branded Sony lenses are amazing, though there is a limited selection compared to Nikon and Canon, who also make great lenses.  Thanks to the missing mirror, you can easily adapt any lens you want onto the Sony body.  I use a (manual-focus, of course) Nikon 28mm lens.  As I understand it you can adapt Canon lenses to the body and still get EXIF, camera-control of the aperture, and AF, but I haven&#x27;t tried it.<p>Software for DSLRs is never good, and Sony is no exception.  I don&#x27;t have a flash attached to my camera, but if I try to turn the flash off (it&#x27;s currently in &quot;W&quot; mode), the camera says &quot;setting not available in aperture priority mode&quot;.  The functions you can map to buttons is stupid (no one-button focus magnification, the only option is a two-step operation).  Their auto-ISO algorithm also makes stupid decisions when you give it other variables control.  Set the lens to f5.6.  Point at something bright.  It decides ISO 1600 at 1/8000 shutter speed.  WHY.<p>That said, you can basically point the camera at something vaguely interesting and the photographs are great, so I won&#x27;t complain.  I took up medium format photography recently and my list of mistakes is impressive.  I have an entire roll of film showing detailed views of my lens cap, for example.  I have some other pictures with perfect composition and exposure ... that I forgot to focus.  This modern technology is quite useful, even if annoying when you&#x27;re looking through the EXIF information and thinking &quot;I wish the camera chose ISO 100 here...&quot;.<p>So in the end I like the Sony.  And it&#x27;s sure small and easy to carry around compared to a &quot;real&quot; DSLR, though still more imposing on your subject than a Leica.",1445129537

For example, a nation without arable land inevitably will have a small population and everything that follows from that: A small economy, a weak military, etc. Some real-world examples: Probably the biggest factor in Britain&#x27;s survival in WWII was that they had a body of water between them and the German army; if they had switched geographies with the French, the results would have been much different. The U.S.&#x27;s WWII success and eventual post-war primacy was mostly because oceans separated the country from its enemies, providing an unmolested homeland, economy and manufacturing of war goods. The geography of Ukraine is easily traversed by large armies, leading to Russia being invaded through Ukraine many times over history (Napoleon and the Nazis come to mind); that is a big reason they want to control Ukraine. Russia&#x27;s lack of access to the Mediterranean and Atlantic has greatly limited their naval power and thus their influence in Europe; that&#x27;s why they care so much about Crimea and Syria, where they have naval bases with access to the Mediterranean. China&#x27;s land borders are the Himalayas, other mountains and deserts, and poor areas such as Central Asia and Siberia; thus their trade is highly dependent on sea routes, resulting in their current actions to control the South China Sea. Overall, the regions of influence China tries to claim now is the same as when the Qing dynasty was ascendant in the 17th and 18th centuries - everything else changes, but geography stays the same.<p>Wrote one historian: <i>If time is the locomotion of history, place could be the gradient against which it is pitted. Dynamic, the one hurtles forward; inert, the other holds it back.</i>[1]<p>How these issues play out is another matter. China could resolve it&#x27;s South China Sea concerns via multilateral agreements, or through military aggression. Also, there are other theories, including realism and constructivism.<p>----<p>[1] John Keay, in India: A History. Keay is not a credentialed academic historian but has written respected surveys of history; I don&#x27;t know how well his theory ultimately holds water, but it&#x27;s the best expression of the issue I&#x27;ve seen.",1445128629

Worse, none of these quite matches the PL-theory meaning. So none of them wound up with the word.<p>One easy way to state a type is to state it as the range of a function.  The function accepts all values, and produces some subset of all values; ideally, all values in its range are fixpoints, f(x) == f(f(x)).  This is kind of nice because you&#x27;ve defined both a constraint and a validation function.  We often want to validate untyped data and make it typed.<p>On the other hand, this range (Urbit&#x27;s &quot;span&quot;) is not the same concept as the function itself (Urbit&#x27;s &quot;mold&quot;).  Moreover, when you send data over the network, you don&#x27;t want to send the range or even the function; you want to send the <i>name</i> of the function, which hopefully is bound to something compatible on the other side.<p>This namespace becomes a third level of type (Urbit&#x27;s &quot;mark&quot;): like a MIME type, if a MIME type was an executable specification.  One of the problems with most PL type systems is that they predate ubiquitous networking; so they&#x27;re not designed to address the problem of describing external data, eg with MIME types, XML DTDs, protobuf schemas or whatever.",1445127388

That&#x27;s besides the point. You claim is that Babylon 5 is not part of science fiction. You think that the allusion to what other people think about Star Wars is relevant to your claim. But as you must well know, that question of &quot;is Star Wars really science fiction&quot; is old and well-worn (eg. <a href=""http://pop-verse.com/2014/12/10/is-star-wars-science-fiction-or-fantasy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pop-verse.com/2014/12/10/is-star-wars-science-fiction...</a> ).<p>It is therefore a poor tool to use to answer the question of &#x27;is Babylon 5 science fiction?&#x27;. My objection was to this use, not that others believe it to be fantasy.<p>This concept of &quot;speculative fiction&quot; as an encompassing term is a perfectly reasonable one to have. However, it does not address the question &#x27;is Babylon 5 science fiction?&#x27;.<p>You can place Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide into &quot;Comic Science Fiction&quot;, but note that &quot;Science Fiction&quot; is in the name. Granted, astronomers say that a dwarf planet isn&#x27;t a planet, but a dwarf star is a star, so it&#x27;s not always possible to infer an is-a relationship in a name, but so far it looks like Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide is part of science fiction.<p>You give what you say is the &quot;classical definition&quot; of &#x27;a work of fiction that uses science as a story telling device to explore ideas&#x27;.<p>As you must surely know, there is no such classical definition, and &quot;its exact definition remains a contested question among both scholars and devotees.&quot; (Quoting <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science_fiction"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science_fiction</a> and reflective of my understanding.)

(A gatekeeper who is used to shutting people down for using the wrong terms is often one who does not want to stick a neck out for worry that it will in turn be cut down.)<p>Do note that the &quot;science fantasy&quot; link you give says the term &quot;has never been clearly defined&quot;. The Heinlein example of &#x27;Magic, Inc.&#x27; has many of the tropes of outright fantasy. I would consider &quot;Glory Road&quot; a better example for this category, with mixed fantasy and science elements. Indeed, if you look in the talk you&#x27;ll see a raging discussion on just that point. In any case, &#x27;Tunnel in the Sky&#x27; has no fantasy elements, so cannot fit into this category.",1445127329

The issue at hand is that people disagree on what &quot;free&quot; means. This can be resolved in a mutually agreeable way by first clarifying the different possible aspects of freeness and clearly separating them out (in your example, one might state them as: BSD allows you to do more things than GPL with source code you receive under the respective license; GPL makes it likelier for you to receive more source code in the future, hence leading to a larger total number of potential actions you can do with source code over time (a point which requires a sub-tree of arguments)).<p>Then you further need to relate those back to the original statement by clarifying how different <i>subjective</i> target functions will have you come to a different final conclusion. (Not to mention that the &quot;GPL is freer than BSD&quot; or vice versa discussion is itself merely a sub-part of the larger &quot;GPL is better than BSD (for my purpose)&quot; or vice versa discussion.)<p>So my point is that it <i>is</i> possible in principle to provide a fully qualified link to a <i>non-subjective</i> presentation of arguments on that particular issue (and any other issue).

Inbound email comes through procmail and is mainly read in emacs (mh-e), which is kind of old fashioned.  I have a small script that makes a new email address within my domain for each new use.  I sign up for a lot of mailing lists and groups, and my /etc/aliases is more than 5300 lines.  I can track if domainA&#x27;s address starts coming from domainB and disable that address, but that doesn&#x27;t happen very often, which is a pleasant surprise.<p>I also have a small script that puts a new sender on my whitelist of sender email addresses.  My whitelist is 12000+ lines right now, collected over many years.  Procmail sorts to mailing lists and vendor folders, and finally puts things that are not on the whitelist into a &quot;possible spam&quot; folder.  From the five or ten items a day, it is easy to spot legitimate emails and I add those to the whitelist.  The majority of spam is blocked by the combination of greylisting and DNSBL lists, as the delay of greylisting (ten minutes for me) is enough for them to make the blackhole list, if they happen to ever attempt delivery again.<p>I was thinking recently that I should be collecting statistics on the use of a lot of those aliases and whitelisted emails, and maybe start garbage collecting my lists.<p>There are various reputation reports and services that can tell you how your mail is doing in the major ISPs, but a lot of those require higher traffic than a personal or small business generates.  There is one service, DMARC[1], that is free and can give you some visibility into how email from your domain is being processed.  I put the txt record in my DNS, and Google, Facebook, Comcast, Yahoo, Fastmail, and a few others send me reports about email they have processed from my domain.  It&#x27;s not that interesting at the moment because things are working, but it might help to debug issues if your email was being rejected.  At least I see a few spammers are trying to use my domain from their servers.<p>[1] <a href=""https://dmarc.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dmarc.org/</a>",1445126890

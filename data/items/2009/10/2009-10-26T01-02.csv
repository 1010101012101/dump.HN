902491,comment,902151,902371,0,0,URSpider94,,,"From my experience, there are a few things that can make your start-up take over your life: customers, investors, competition and personal drive.<p>Depending on your market segment, customers can be very demanding.  If your web site goes down at midnight on Friday, you can't very well let it wait until Monday at 9:00 to put right, can you?<p>Investors have fronted you money on the expectation of explosive growth.  If you don't deliver that growth, they might not be around the next time that you need cash.<p>In web-based businesses, speed is a major asset to keep you ahead of the competition.  Hopefully, you've got a head start on the copy-cats, but there are more of them, and some of them might even be as smart as you.<p>Finally, there's personal drive -- as I think you've identified, start-ups do attract a certain personality type who aren't the kind to leave a job half-done and call it a day.<p>In closing, I would ask you a question -- you run a small business, but is it a start-up?  PG has been pretty clear in many of his other essays that these two are not interchangeable.  After all, the start-ups that are being discussed here are hoping not to be small businesses for long!",1256522013

So the work you put in to learning it will be well rewarded in productivity gains and sheer number of things that can be done in it that most other editors couldn't even dream of doing.<p>And once you learn it, vim is actually quite fun to use; and you might find that going back to using more traditional editors is painful, because of their inefficiency and lack of features compared to vim.",1256521836

On average (assuming you don't know what the other person will choose) you get more money (1.0 if you steal versus 0.5 if you split) and you can never be betrayed.<p>More than that: each player decides whether the other player takes any money or not. However since the players decisions are independent it doesn't make sense to say 'split'.",1256521524

Colin's online storage for technically astute paranoids is probably somewhere in the middle.<p>So it really doesn't matter what you do if you're not targeting your market correctly.

If you have been through the first few chapters of the book, you should be able to do some cool stuff with nearest neighbors or linear classifiers.

The problem wasn't that the talks were horrible in and of themselves. But it appears that he totally underestimated some of the audience's abilities. I couldn't have been the only person there that's used ASP.NET MVC, Python, jQuery, and Ruby. For us, the talks weren't insightful because they were all introductory.<p>That said, I chatted with some attendees who thought the talks were great because they only program in ASP.NET (old style) and have never been exposed to these sort of languages. I guess they're the developers that ask the questions on StackOverflow and people like us are the ones answering the questions? :-) Or maybe I was just unlucky enough to know about the languages they decided to focus on.

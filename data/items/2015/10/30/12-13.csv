It takes special effort to consciously stop noticing it.<p>Malthus premised his hypothesis on an assertion that there were obvious limits to growth.  Both the premise of obvious limits to growth and the conclusion of catastrophic resource scarcity due to population growth were wrong.<p>Our food supply is an obvious limit to population growth like an unlocked door is an obvious limit to leaving a room.  Yes, if you do nothing, then you will be limited.  That should not instill hand-wringing, existential dread.<p>> Malthus sounds much more probable than your &quot;don&#x27;t worry, future generations will somehow fix it&quot;.<p>History has proven Malthus and his modern incarnation Ehrlich to be wrong time and time again, which doesn&#x27;t bode well for that probability of yours.<p>Again, &quot;don&#x27;t worry, future generations will somehow fix it&quot; is a strawman.  Pithy, but vapid.  Firstly, I said <i>we</i> will engineer ways to overcome limitations.  Our current generation is, and will continue to, engineer ways to feed ourselves, generate potable water, control our climate, clean our air, thrive, and grow our population.<p>Do I have proof that the engineers of future generations won&#x27;t all squander their life and do nothing more than optimize sales funnels and click-through-rates?  No.  But I think it is much more probable that our society will continue to produce some engineers that have not only the talent but the focus we need to break through our current brittle limitations to population growth -- just like their parents, grandparents, and every generation before them did.",1446209664

It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after three years, we’re moving data for a third of all K-12 students in America (20M kids), and 46,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of 85 (36 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Python and Coffeescript.

What you might not realise is that by removing predators you will also have to change each and every other animal or organism that is currently alive in the world. You are talking about re-engineering almost all living creatures on our planet.<p>Let me explain by way of an example that is close to home for me. In my country of birth we have many areas which normally used to have free roaming wildlife including predators like lions and leopards. These areas where subsequently taken over as farm land and the big cats removed. This allowed the pray, usually antelope and other herbivores, to breed out of control causing immeasurable damage to the vegetation and if left unchecked would cause these animals to die of starvation in the end. It might sound far fetched but these ever increasing herds do cause damage to the vegetation if their numbers become too big. Given this situation farmers and conservationists either have to organise regular culls of these animals or capture and relocate them. Unfortunately there is only so many place you can relocate them to before the natural environment cannot accommodate them anymore and starvation due to destroyed vegetation sets in.<p>Predators in these natural eco-systems serve a very necessary function.<p>I am not talking about Human predators here so please dont confuse the above example with justifying why some human beings prey on others. Human predators need to be removed from our society. We are not animals and have the ability to reason which sets a different standard for us.<p>What I am trying to illustrate is the logical conclusion of your very well intended desire to reduce suffering.

It&#x27;s a bit early to tell, but treating the writing as my only goal, rather than as a supplement to coding work, is doing things to my perspective...there&#x27;s definitely a need for the humanities in technical environments. A really great piece of writing can do more than instruct clearly, it can motivate creative uses, put the techniques into perspective and lead people away from dangerous ideas. As well, in-depth writing about technology is a great way to review its real utility and add discipline to development that has gone astray.<p>And there is so much technology that would benefit from doing this better. I think it might be the proper antidote to cargo culting.",1446206822

There&#x27;s almost no coverage of the Draft Communications Bill or DRIP because the average UK citizen doesn&#x27;t find some legislation that might be debated which might compel ISPs to hold the same sort of data they already hold for a bit longer to be particularly intelligible, never mind interesting when compared with tax credit cuts, migrants, people being blown up in Syria and the latest celebrity gossip. Or as Charlie Brooker, hardly the most technophobic or pro-government of commentators put it, it&#x27;s the &quot;the most tedious outrage ever&quot;. There was rather more noise made (on both sides of the debate) about the more emotive issue of Cameron&#x27;s attempt to censor internet porn. It&#x27;s not as if the media is seeking to hide the fact that private messages people have sent, websites they&#x27;ve visited or triangulated locations from mobile phones are regularly used in prosecutions and have been long before this legislation hit the drafting table. Or indeed as if proposed legislative measures are not being discussed at all: here&#x27;s the far-from-supportive angle of the newspaper closest to being the informal mouthpiece of the Conservative government: <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11964655/Police-to-be-granted-powers-to-view-your-internet-history.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11964655/Police...</a><p>As for Snowden, even on this website where people actually understand the potential of surveillance techniques it&#x27;s the stories about his personal situation and options, as widely run in all UK newspapers from all angles, that seem to have captured the imagination more than the details of what was revealed.

Anecdotal.<p>From your earlier post:<p><i>""Funny anecdote: a recent olympic swimming team failed to ride to the stadium in Beijing because most of them couldn't ride bikes.""</i><p>I'm skeptical about this. I've been in Beijing traffic.   Also consider the indignity: Olympic swimmers riding bicycles (not their sport) to the stadium, heads bowed over and the risk of falling on their face before thousands of people and getting injured. In contrast compare walking  proudly upright, waving with both hands to the crowd. Claiming that one is not able to ride a bicycle seems like an excellent face-saving excuse for all parties involved.<p><i>""where you get your info from about ""tall"" people are stronger""</i><p>I got it in first grade on the playground.

Not counting reply upvotes does prevent long, mutual karma-generating exchanges,\nbut if it's trying to disguise that reality from users it isn't very effectively disguised.\nI'm not 100% convinced it's deliberate, but it could be, like that idea of making trolls invisible, but not letting them know they are invisible (not sure how that's applicable here, maybe so people don't explore trickier ways of getting karma)<p>I agree that ORMs are good for the basic impedance mismatch, but are hard to optimize for more complex queries.

So you disagree with those agile ideas of ""you ain't gonna need it"" and ""release early, release often"". You're describing something like the waterfall model. I'm actually not against the waterfall model, it's just that you need to have done a few similar projects to have the requisite level of judgment, like a carpenter building his 10th kitchen. Most practitioners aren't at this level of expertise - they'll still learning what the <i>problem</i> is. If they try to do what you suggest without your level of experience, they'll <i>really</i> make a mess. It's a matter of a novice knowing that they don't know.<p>I agree that working with experienced folk would help, but such folk are in short supply (though possibly many people are reluctant to find them, and would rather be the ""experts"" themselves - maybe this is what you find objectionable).<p>I guess he could have gained much more experience in 5 years, if he had done several database projects over that period, instead of improving just the one.",1259156818

961085,comment,960400,960400,0,0,dkersten,,,"I'm not saying this to undermine the article or suggest that I'm in any way more experienced or knowledgeable (I'm probably not) - nor am I disagreeing (at least, not with all of it) and certainly not saying this as advice to others, but heres my, personal, responses to these points:<p><i>Not using a proper ORM</i><p>I solved this one by switching to a NoSQL database. Fancy ORM? Bleh, too complex, brittle, hassle, whatever - schema free databases let me store my objects however I like and give me other (potential) benefits too, like MongoDBs sharding, replication, nicely parallel map/reduce etc. I also free myself from having to come up with <i>future proof</i> schemas (or emulating a schema free database with complex tables).<p><i>Not learning generics soon enough</i><p>While I agree with this, I think it misses another issue: over-reliance on the OO paradigm. By only using OO when it actually makes sense and using other abstractions when it doesn't (streams, trees, lists, tables, relationships, immutable state, whatever), I've achieved even more generic software components and reusable code than generics would give me and also (potentially) gained other advantages too (better abstractions for reasoning about my solution, clearer code, better concurrency...)<p><i>Reinvent the wheel</i><p>If you're reasonably new to programming (or even just a single language or paradigm or domain), the only excuse to reinvent the wheel is as a learning experience. At this stage, you don't have enough experience to write your own production ready version. No excuses. Later, though, I think there are times when its appropriate to reinvent the wheel and at this point you should have enough experience to recognize them, but even then, I imagine its rare.<p><i>Too much documentation</i><p>Unfortunately hes right.. which is problematic, because not documenting isn't the answer either. Having self-documenting code is important, but ultimately won't help user-of-your-api (who may never get a chance to review the code to figure out what it does) as much as some <i>real</i> documentation.. Anyone whos ever had to code with only some standards committees spec knows how fun this is... Same goes for having only an API reference available - great if you already know how everything works together and need.. a reference.. useless if you have no idea how anything works yet.<p><i>No automated build</i><p>I totally agree with this. I often don't use automated builds for my own projects, but once they get in any way complex, I write at least a shell script to make this easier.<p><i>Rely on visual inspection and debugging too much</i><p>You can never do enough to ensure your code is as good as it can be.. unfortunately costs mean you have to draw the line somewhere and leave it be. Debugging and visual inspection aren't proactive enough to ensure quality and theres a large amount of things that can be done to try and minimize error, but at the end of the day, its likely not quite enough and you'll end up debugging anyway.. :-(<p><i>No unit test</i><p>I agree here too. One of the techniques to help above. Also helps protect when refactoring and helps minimize wasted effort.",1259156772

I looked for an appropriate marker in one case that would at least suggest that the article as a whole did not represent a neutral point of view or was completely unsupported by any factual evidence, but after a few minutes trying to navigate Wikipedia's absurdly overcomplicated self-documentation and finding nothing but reasons I wasn't allowed to fix anything or contribute, I gave up and found something else to do with my time.<p>I wonder whether the neutral point of view principle isn't a significant part of the problem. Many of the pages I find most misleading are deadlocked, because no-one can agree on what a neutral point of view is.<p>Under those circumstances, perhaps it would be more helpful to do what civilised discussion has done since forever: present two articles (or sections in an article) that, by construction and intent, take opposing viewpoints. Let the reader see both sides of the debate, making the best case they can and with the best sources they can find to support their point of view, and let the reader decide. As long as it is very clear when there is a single article trying to present a subject neutrally and when the adversarial system is in use, I don't see why this would cause a problem, and it would break a lot of the deadlocks I've seen and get constructive editing going again.",1259154756

This is a PITA since a lot of anonymous classes are using just that by boxing those vars in final arrays ... which is the kind of  boilerplate I could do without, but I guess readability of code is not a priority (oh, the irony).<p>The second problem ... the proposal is not final, but from what I've seen the ""Function type"" has to deal with primitives, and they are going to do that through code-specialization ... and if that's the case, it would be yet another case where they are introducing exceptions in the language (like it's the case for arrays or for operator overloading). I'm not even going to mention the ""special"" syntax introduced for collections.<p>The third problem ... since we are talking about fork/join, it would be best to leave the constructing of the query to the designer of the framework, therefore returning the syntax tree of a closure (instead of the method refence) would be really useful. The proposal doesn't include such ""futurist"" notions though (LISP's quote is very cutting-edge after all).<p>The fourth problem ... it would be best to deprecate Java in favor of something else running on the JVM. But what chances would a language have that isn't totally different (in which case it would diverge from the type system, therefore slow or with interoperability problems) or that doesn't have feature-bloat to differentiate itself from Java (like Scala, which IMHO it's an abomination). The point being that adding features to Java makes life harder for everyone (including people using/developing other languages). Why not concentrate on advancing the JVM instead? Still no tail-calls, still no stack-allocated objects (with escape-analysis not delivering on its promise), and invoke-dynamic is one whole year away from being released.<p>And closures are a language feature that happened long before Java appeared, and it's been talked about it ever since the start. See this article about ""Microsoft's delegates"" ... <a href=""http://java.sun.com/docs/white/delegates.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://java.sun.com/docs/white/delegates.html</a><p>Now they want to add closures because that's the only sane way to work with fork/join frameworks? No shit. It saddens me because it took a really loooooong time for them to realize this ... design by committee  at its best.",1259154681

According to the docs, ""Two Random objects created within the same millisecond will have the same sequence of random numbers"" which really really isn't likely to be what you want.<p>To get sensible results, you need instead to keep a single Random object around and use it every time you need another bit.

A simple Maybe Monad would fix it (of course, because of previously mentioned syntax problems - I need the language implementors to add syntactic sugar since library-based Maybe Monads are too ugly.<p>-Generics and autoboxing were a good start at fixing the terrible type/primitive system, but Sun has proved unwilling to break backwards bytecode compatibility, which leaves us with ugly hacks like type erasure.<p>The JVM is undeniably impressive (and even more so once we get invokedynamic and tailcall bytecodes) and I think that is going to be the true legacy of Java.

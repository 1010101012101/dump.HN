Maybe, due to certain structural differences. There were pensions, which tied employees to the long term futures of their companies. There was investment in training new recruits. There was promotion from within. Today, by and large none of those things exist. Companies, even ones who have the resources and should no better, are more interested in finding someone already trained (and griping about how they can't find them) than investing in training new people (and of course they fail to realize the correlation between the two phenomenon).

""What it it goes down?"" is one question. But you also should be asking yourself about what will happen if it gets hacked. There are also user privacy issues, which get completely overlooked in the chase for shaving off several milliseconds off request time.<p>A much better architecture would be to serve JavaScript from your server by default, but allow for distributed content-based caching. For example, your script tag could look like this<p><script src=""some.js"" hash=""ha3ee938h8eh38a9h49ha094h"" /><p>The hash would be calculated based on the content of the file. The browser then could fetch it from whatever source it wants. Users could cache stuff locally (across websites), without needing to dial into a CDN every time. You could even use a torrent-like network for distributed delivery of popular script libraries.",1367419867

We have over 650,000 users and are on a $1.3m+ annual revenue run rate. There are some super interesting challenges ahead, as we are looking to pass a million users in 2013. We are expecting even faster growth in the coming months through our mobile efforts.<p>We need help on 2 areas right now:<p>1. Android:<p><pre><code>    - Android is our second highest source of signups for Buffer, only
      trailing behind Web which was our original platform.
    - our users love the app, which has a 4.3 rating on Google Play.
    - the app has 100k+ total downloads and 3k daily active users.
    - we work with Google Play, Kindle and Blackberry stores.
</code></pre>
2. Full stack:<p><pre><code>    - we get 1,500-2,000 signups per day on the web
    - we have 160,000 weekly active users for our Chrome extension
    - 4,500 API clients. Most popular: Feedly, IFTTT, Pocket, Instapaper
    - we ship to production multiple times a day
    - we have a data-driven process, with Einstein, our custom
      built a/b testing framework
    - ideally, experience in: PHP (Codeigniter)/Python, MongoDB,
      Backbone.js Javascript, CSS, HTML

</code></pre>
We're a small team of driven hackers and happiness heroes (our support people). Just like you, we're excited and passionate about engineering challenges and have some interesting architecture and scaling problems we work on.<p>If you're interested in coming on board, you will:<p><pre><code>    - work closely myself on Product and Sunil on technical
      architecture
    - ship to thousands of users and iterate quickly
    - work with our metrics team to make smart changes
    - be friendly and comfortable talking directly to customers
      on issues and features
    - be a happy, positive-minded and kind person who has a great
      approach in dealing with others
    - be a Buffer user (would be awesome, its cool if not)
    - be anywhere in the world, and if you'd like, you have help and
      support from us to move to where you want to be
    - have experience working with another startup before (would
      be awesome, its cool if not)
</code></pre>
Some aspects of Buffer culture that makes us a little different:<p><pre><code>    - we are totally transparent. We raised $450k, we currently
      have 650k users and generate $110k/mo. Ask me anything else!
    - within the company, all salaries and equity are open and we
      have a formula for the distribution.
    - we're all very focused on self improvement - we have daily
      standups where we discuss our current improvements. This
      could be waking up earlier, starting public speaking, blogging,
      exercise, learning a language, etc.
    - culture deck: http://www.slideshare.net/joelg2/buffer-culture-01-16707113

Salary: 88k-110k depending on location (living costs) and experience.<p>Equity: 0.5-1%<p>If this sounds fun, let's chat.

People gripe about ""bureaucracy"", but when bureaucracy works, it's actually quite fair and effective.<p>In 2013, we face a world where management (rarely with competent training in anything other than not getting the company sued) blatantly plays favorites, ""teams"" sometimes turn on their strongest members, investment in junior peoples' careers is almost nonexistent, and firing is more likely to involve one of those humiliating, dishonest, and impossible ""performance improvement plans"" than a decent severance check. Imagine what high school would be like if the popular kids graded exams. That's what corporate work is like for most people.<p>If someone transfers through 5 colleges in 8 years before finally getting a degree, it's pretty clear that something unusual happened. That's a red flag. Colleges make a lot of effort not to be dysfunctional and to make evaluation fair, so it's a real warning sign if someone passes through 3 or 4 and can't succeed. Companies don't. They'd rather sacrifice fairness, decency, and protocol under the belief (perhaps mistaken?) that it makes them more efficient at delivering on projects. That volatile culture would be fine, if they weren't so stuck up about ""job hoppers"" in the hiring process.<p>We're not disloyal. We're just honest. Instead of sticking around and sabotaging a company that betrays us (out of fear of a job-hopper stigma, like what our parents faced) we leave. That's better for us and the companies.",1367419718

I don't actively seek out opportunities to get up in front of people and be the center of attention.  Over the past year I've spoken a lot publicly for moderately lengthy periods -- maybe 45 mins at a time -- and I agree with the sentiment that you just get better/more comfortable with experience.  If you feel nervous before you speak you are the norm and not the exception.  To quote Jerry Seinfeld: ""According to most studies, people's number one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. Death is number two. Does that sound right? This means to the average person, if you go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.<p>I prescribe to Malcolm Gladwell's method of preparation [1] in that I write out every single word of my talks beforehand and more-or-less memorize them.  It's not my explicit goal to memorize every word, but I go over the words enough that that's essentially what happens. I actually end up memorizing key sentences and phrases more than words. Even moments that I seemingly ""ad-lib"" to the audience -- jokes, side comments, ""random"" anecdotes -- are written out beforehand.  That way when I'm in the moment I can focus on delivery and not content.<p>I think the biggest driver to my anxiety of public speaking was the possibility of sounding stupid, but as long as I have the confidence that I've written out a good argument beforehand then that goes out the window.  I stick to the script because I know the script will work.<p>As far as mentality goes, there is no better feeling than looking out into an audience of people and see them staring back at you, listening to every word.  No smartphones out and no sleeping, just attention.  While I still get a little nervous, it's nowhere near what it once was, and I actually look forward to connecting with those whom I've been invited to speak with.  My excitement for that connection has started to trump my nerves.<p>Clearly I'm not in the camp of ""don't prepare and just go wing it, it'll be more natural"" because it really opens up the door for panic-induced disaster. And I really hate sitting in a talk that the speaker is clearly unprepared for.  It's unprofessional and disrespectful.  If people are going to give you the respect of their undivided attention, give them the respect of real preparation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.thepowerofintroverts.com/2011/01/26/public-speaking-for-introverts-tip-1-courtesy-of-malcolm-gladwell/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thepowerofintroverts.com/2011/01/26/public-speaki...</a>",1367417137

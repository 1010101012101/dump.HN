I lean more to the latter, I am usually happy to  seed, as you put it, other startups I find useful, but not necessarily meeting my needs.<p>I think posting your startup on news.yc allows it to be given a closer look since the community here is much tighter than most sites. I'm much more willing to graze past the usual .5 second judgment of any site posted here.",1178587565

(That may differ from what they are getting paid right now, but they can always change jobs.) <p>It might help for you to understand that ""worth"" is defined as what people will pay for something. It's subjective. There's no absolute value that someone should be paid in exchange for labour. It depends on what employers think they are worth,<p>""However, I would also note that since what people get paid depends on the existance of Unions""<p>False. Most people aren't in Unions, and the average wage has risen faster than the wage demands from unions. People get paid based on their worth to employers. (Productivity etc) <p>""So in any case I am in favor of trying to increase the worth of people.""<p>The only way to increase the worth of people is to make them more productive. (Skills, investing in machinery etc.) If you force employers to pay them more you will just cause anyone not worth that amount to become unemployed.<p>""Not that this is really relevant, but most people who lead companies actually do not need their workers""<p>So why do these money grabbing capitalists employ them then? Wouldn't they make even more money by getting rid of them?<p>And you still haven't shown me how employing someone exploits them.",1178587358
20375,comment,20249,20313,0,0,greendestiny,,,"Well at least unions have become cartels. I don't see a problem with voluntary bodies representing workers, advocating for them as a body and so forth. In fact I think remove special protections for unions would make them more accountable to their members, making them better at doing what they are suppose to do; look after their members.",1178586721

20368,comment,20249,20363,0,0,lupin_sansei,,,"But you could say also that the employer needs a worker, and also isn't really freely entering into the contract. Utter nonsense! Both parties freely enter into the agreement. You might not have the freedom not to have a job, but you do have the freedom to choose which job to take. That freedom means that nobody can pay you less then you are worth, else you'll leave. Therefore nobody employer can exploit you. (That is pay you less then you're worth.)",1178586005

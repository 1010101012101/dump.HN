The information I need is Year, Mileage and Price of the car for sale.  I would also like to store a link to the competitors web page for that car so my users could get more information.<p>Of course, my competitors aren't going to be happy and would like to stop me producing a website based on their data.  I know that in Europe there is a 'database right' which would prevent me from using their data.  But could I do this in the US?  What about Australia?  Are there any court cases which have settled the issue?<p>Thanks",1296723474

back from the debacle and try to see it from the user perspective.<p>The real company motto of Google is simply, ""Be Creepy."" Even your CEO
Eric Schmidt has said as much. Google will track people and invade
privacy in every way it believes it can get away with. That is just the
Faustian bargain every person makes when using Google.<p>Microsoft simply implemented another way to be creepy, invade privacy
and track users that Google didn't think they could get away with or
Google would have implemented the same. Sadly, Microsoft is actually
getting away with it.<p>Both Google and Microsoft are creepy. Both companies spy on people for
numerous reasons including for the sake of improving search results.<p>Now here is the tough question; Why do you believe Google has some sort
of moral high-ground in this dispute when Google would do the same if
they could get away with it?<p>The difficult part about posting this pointed question is I'm actually a
big fan of all the hard and important work you do removing scam and spam
sites from the Google search results. Though I may be critical of some
of the practices of your company, you personally have my respect for the good stuff you do.",1296722625

2174087,comment,2171963,2174058,0,0,gojomo,,,"Interesting, thanks, but doesn't address my question. To be clear, I'm wondering: are clicktrails from Google Toolbar, Google Analytics, Ad programs, or other sources (beyond just Google Search outclicks) ever used to help calculate search rankings?<p>Robots.txt-sensitive crawling is irrelevant to this question, and whether their toolbar tracks clicks from other search engine result pages is only tangentially relevant, as one small example of the general idea.<p>And I'm not asking if they've ever done exactly the click inference Bing has done. Rather, I wonder if they're doing vaguely analogous indirect mining of revealed web user preferences via clicktrails. For example, noticing which sites were visited together or in certain order even without crawler-visible links between them. Or noticing which pages were viewed for the longest/shortest times. Or which pages seemed to 'end' a purposeful session. Or other deep-science stuff I can't even imagine.<p>I don't want them to reveal any proprietary secrets – just whether they have ever used (or would consider it legitimate to use) all the clicktrail data from all their many non-search tools to help with search quality.<p>Because I've long assumed that they do, and would be surprised if they didn't.",1296720738

And then went on to further say that it probably would not happen at all (even with the user's permission). The last sentence was further limiting the scope of what Google will do, not expanding it.<p>That totally depends on how you read that entire (2 short paragraph) response -- you can take it with an optimists viewpoint and say he really is saying they have no intention of ever abusing that information.  But I'm sorry, if that truly was his intent he chose his words <i>very</i> poorly.  ""And we probably, in many cases, won't do it forever."" can easily be taken to be applied to his entire  comment, and that doesn't inspire confidence in me that I can take his comments for what I perceive he <i>wants</i> me to take them to mean.<p>Yeah, I'd like to live in a world where I can take the word of business executives at face value, and never be concerned that what they appear to be saying may not be what they are actually saying.  However, life experience has shown that the world I live in is not such a world.<p>> > He sounds to me like someone who is saying exactly what he thinks people want him to say<p>> He is talking to investors, not privacy advocates. He is saying the opposite of what investors want to hear. Investors would want him to say ""we are sitting on a high-value treasure trove of marketing information, and of course we will use it to enhance the value of our ads products whenever we can."" Instead he is saying exactly the opposite of what would increase Google's perceived value.<p>Regardless of the audience that was immediately before him, Schmidt knows his words will be out in public view.  I was not arguing that he was telling investors what they wanted to hear, I was arguing that he could be telling users of Google's search engine what they want to hear.  If you are trying to project the message that Google won't abuse data they've collected about you regarding your browsing habits, as a Google executive, you will try to make it sound like that is true no matter what forum you are in -- if there is significant chance that the public will hear about it.  I still say there is a decent chance of Schmidt wanting to have it both ways here -- wanting the public to believe Google won't abuse the data, but still leaving the possibility that they can change their policy in the future (while, of course, intending the public to believe that that will never ever happen).<p>> > Yes, perhaps Schmidt was only trying to cover the company's collective rear end for when federal laws require them to disclose information, but if so, He has done an extremely poor job of convincing me (and obviously many others in the world) that such was his intention.<p>> What about the fact that his very next sentence was: ""If you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines -- including Google -- do retain this information for some time and it's important, for example, that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act and it is possible that all that information could be made available to the authorities.""<p>I think you misunderstood what I was trying to say here.  I wasn't arguing that Schmidt was not trying to cover Google's legal responsibilities (in fact, I totally agree that he <i>was</i> trying to do that).  I was arguing that he has not convinced me that covering said responsibilities was the <i>only</i> thing he was trying to do (I put the ""only"" in the first part of the first sentence, I should have also said ""only intention"" at the end of the second sentence).  Bottom line is I am not convinced that Schmidt has zero intentions of allowing Google to exploit data gathered about individual's use of Google's search engine (and anything they can tie that use to) for financial gain.",1296720651

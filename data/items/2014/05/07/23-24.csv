However, even the humble Riemann integral would be able to find the area under the graph of a bounded function on a compact interval which is continuous on a set of full Lebesgue measure.  Any other function only has a &quot;well-defined area&quot; for some seriously stunted notion of area; you can integrate more functions with a different integral, but what one calls a &quot;well-defined area&quot; pretty much depends on what kind of integral you&#x27;re using at that point.",1399507117

7713259,comment,7708437,7708437,1,0,kator,,,"I just finished reading:<p><pre><code>   On Death and Dying\n   by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross\n</code></pre>\nBecause my ex-wife of 21 years and the mother of my 3 children is quickly being taken away by cancer.  I am a man of science and I recognized much of what was going down, and she wanted to know it all, every detail, she doesn&#x27;t want us to hide a thing.  It&#x27;s horrifying to share such things with a woman I have loved for 30 years.  But she trusts me not to lie to her, she wants to know so she can prepare.  One of her sisters works in a breast cancer clinic and knows how this goes all too well.  We&#x27;ve all tried hard to help her but the reality is that at some point it&#x27;s just too late.  I feel for the caretakers who deal with this on daily basis, I can barely handle one case I can’t imagine dealing with it daily and thousands of cases.<p>I have dealt with death in many forms, from instant &quot;Oh by the way this person passed today&quot; and over time.  They all suck, but if you&#x27;re lucky dealing with death over time can be a bittersweet gift for everyone involved.  You have time to share and say goodbye and talk about things we all forget to say to each other each day.  My children are devastated but again, none of us know when we&#x27;ll go, a taxi driver could hit me while I’m walking to work tomorrow.  The challenge is the balance, we each want and need to believe we live a life that includes tomorrow and these patients are told the number of tomorrows are much smaller then each of us assumes when we get up in the morning.  It&#x27;s the dichotomy of life, without death life means nothing, but with death comes so much grief, pain and sorrow.<p>This story touches me because I too understand what&#x27;s ahead and as it has unfolded I want to hate myself for being right.  There is the science of what is happening and the real human tragedy of it all.<p>This seems like a very strange article to run across on Hacker News and to be 100% honest I was here trying hard to avoid thinking about what is unfolding in my family’s life.  All I can say is thank you to the poster for pointing this article out.  I think there is an interesting juxtaposition between the knowledge every Hacker wants to know and how you can’t unlearn once you have learned something.  Imagine the horror of understanding all the technical details of what’s happening to your loved one while being totally helpless to do anything about it.  Some say that ignorance is bliss, and maybe it is for some people.  I think the big question is do you want to know?  Or do you choose ignorance?  For me, knowing and understanding has always been a blessing with a certain weight that I am willing to carry, even if it means understanding how someone I’ve loved for 30 years is slowly dying.  At least when she’s gone I will not have to guess what happened…",1399506742

7713214,comment,7712328,7712328,4,0,btilly,,,"On my random forays into C++, I saw different things.  Here were my three most important optimizations.<p>1. Replace strings with integers wherever possible.  Create a mapping table, use the indexes.<p>2. Layout related objects close in memory.  Even if it requires special data structures to do.  Suppose that if I need A I am likely to need B soon.  If B is physically close to A, then I am likely to find it in cache, which is about 10x as fast.  So, for instance, don&#x27;t store a tree as a bunch of random pointers.  Store it as offsets inside of a fixed container of memory.<p>3. Process data according to how it is laid out in memory.  For instance walk through a vector, don&#x27;t do random access into it.  Again this is all about trying to make sure that stuff is in cache as often as possible.<p>For the second and third points I found it was a case of do it perfectly or don&#x27;t worry about it.  For example if I am missing cache regularly in three places, fixing one only mades my code 50% faster.  Fixing the second one almost doubled my speed.

7713189,comment,7712710,7713011,2,0,_delirium,,,"<i>There&#x27;s a lot of talk about about Tesla being a startup or a tech company. In reality, they&#x27;re a car company (albeit one that&#x27;s doing a few things better/differently), and need to be looked at in that context.</i><p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about this a bit lately, more generally. My impression is that what counts as a &quot;tech startup&quot; in the past few years is more of a <i>cultural</i> question than a business, technological, or economic question. Now whether that&#x27;s a good or bad thing is another question. There is something to the cultural resemblance, though I worry that it&#x27;s papering over pretty significant differences, which might in some cases be more important than the cultural similarities.<p>Tech startups are, to some extent, just those new companies that culturally use the language of, and interact with, the social milieu of the startup scene. One has to have a <i>general</i> interest in technology, but it can range from deep to very superficial. Tech startups can be wholly based on developing novel technology; or their level of technology might not extend much further than &quot;has an Android app&quot;. They could be bootstrapped capital-light companies, or capital-intensive companies in traditional industries. What seems to matter to the classification is more of a style or culture or attitude.<p>They aren&#x27;t really distinguished by <i>using technology</i>, because everyone does that now. They aren&#x27;t even distinguished by technology being their &quot;thing&quot;, because many companies seen as tech startups culturally are actually pretty light on the technology— e.g. AirBnB doesn&#x27;t really use technology more than any other travel-industry player does... they&#x27;re mostly a new-business-model play, which happens to deploy the business model through a website, because nearly <i>everything</i> in travel has gone through a website for 10+ years now.<p>My guess is that we&#x27;ll start to differentiate again a bit more in the coming years, based on more structural and less cultural factors.",1399505570

For example, I&#x27;m using docker for a build/test system; we spin up a container from an image, run some stuff in it for a few seconds, and then shut it down. 90% of the time, the images are &#x27;unreferenced&#x27;.<p>The other suggestion, put forward by a docker dev in another comment, is to have a clean command for unnamed/untagged images. Our build system has &#x27;buildbot&#x27; (python package compilation) and &#x27;software&#x27; (test environment) images, so this sort of automated cleaning would get rid of all of that extra crap that we have lying around.<p>The big issue for me is stacks of changes.

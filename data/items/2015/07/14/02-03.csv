Nowhere does this become more apparent than in the real estate industry. Its natural inclination is toward Bernie Madoff-like pyramid, where consolidation and cartel-like cooperation among &quot;a few&quot; (the Brokers and Agents) hurts &quot;the many&quot;.  Agents are forced into paying brokers for the &quot;privilege&quot; of association and access to the MLS... agents pass those costs on to clients by forcing those clients to sign on the dotted lines (&quot;closing the deal&quot;). Clients end up paying inflated commissions, as each person (or entity) up the chain takes their cut in larger and larger portions.<p>42Floors was trying to be the Redfin of commercial real estate?  Well of course that doesn&#x27;t solve the problems created by the existence of brokerages, especially when we&#x27;re talking about <i>renting</i> or <i>leasing</i> a space, where ROI is already ridiculously negative from the get-go.  Where commissions are just unnecessary garbage expenses.  Why would it ever have been a good idea to involve brokerages at all?<p><i>We’re going to step decisively away from that model now and focus only on providing a great search experience. We’ll leave the deal closing to the professionals.<p>Over time, we’ll develop our new business model, which will be based around premium listing opportunities for those that want greater exposure to tenants</i><p>So the idea is to package the potential client list from a &quot;better search engine&quot; and sell it to those poor, struggling brokerages like it&#x27;s insider information?

9882555,comment,9881696,9881696,0,0,nikhilkalegregg,,,"You are young.  Becoming a coder is very doable at that age.  I started self-teaching myself how to code a little less than a year ago just before I was 24 with no prior experience besides believing myself to be raw at math just like yourself.  \nIf you understand math, it should not be too difficult.  Everything is abstractions, and you get to create the abstractions. If you think about coding in terms of just organizing tables, it makes it really easy.  Some of the fancier stuff might take some time (or some copying and pasting), but most of the syntax that is probably going to intimidate you is not necessarily useful in practice.   Think of it as writing an argument in a philosophy class.  What are the system’s conditionality’s?  What is the end goal of the program? Sound, clean and uncluttered logic with a distinct argument and point is what you are going for.  \nPersonally, I found that I learned very fast using PHP, MySQL, HTML5, jQuery, JavaScript, and the LAMP stack. It gave me the foundation to do AJAX (asynchronous calling) and learn a lot of the intimidatingly sounding frameworks which are not altogether that useful, necessarily (I only know as far as my opinion).  But I would recommend checking out that stack. They work together nicely and are not syntactically challenging. Another thing I&#x27;d recommend is replacing your recreational gaming like crossword puzzles, sudoku, etc with Project Euler.  Its an enjoyable way to learn while using competitive fuel/energy rather than draining any oil of finishing a task for a task’s sake.\nHowever, for me, 100%, the single most important thing was setting myself projects, and committing myself to them despite my subconscious knowing they had no chance at success.  The project I chose was a music new-era napster/iTunes in the cloud website.  I would recommend something similar because it is relatively enjoyable to learn/code and there are a million different ways you can improve any base product you have, (offline playing, sharing at the blink of an eye, efficient uploading, and you can get rid of Spotify, Pandora, etc. You can also make it illegal as shit and feel like a cowboy and just see how great you can make it.  Chances are, it will be really illegal but better than anything else you can currently get right now.  Use that as motivation, enjoy the fruits of your labor, save money, and inspire yourself to keep going.<p>Once you&#x27;ve exhausted the features you can add to a music app, you can execute any idea that you come up with that utilizes the Internet, sharing, etc.  You won&#x27;t necessarily become a master of 4D printing, but any theory you have about anything you can test and create a physical representation of on the Internet.\nDon&#x27;t rush building it for the sake of finishing.  Learn and understand what you are doing and your next project will have the potential of promis. I spent 3-4 months working on a website that I knew had no chance of becoming anything.  However, I just kept smashing my head against the wall and making it better while slowly but surely improving my skillset to the point where new things now come easily, because I understand the philosophy.\nNow that I have moved on from that initial music website I can now pursue much more innovative and intellecutually stimulating projects (which I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to do had I not spent so much time on a project that I knew had no chance of success).  \nGive yourself a throw away project, commit yourself to it, and use it as training for the next one.  If you truly commit yourself, you should be able to build pretty much anything you see on the Internet 1 year from now.  That is not a guarantee!  But you have plenty of time and there no reason not to believe  that you cannot.",1436841744

The interior will wear out long before the engine. If the car manufacturers built the drivetrain to last 400,000 miles, they would just be wasting money.<p>If the car is running 24/7 at 30 mph, you would top 250k miles per year. I imagine they will design the cars to last more than a year, potentially a few, so 750,000 miles is not off the table.<p>Also in the world where a car is an autonomous income producing asset, initial cost matters a lot less and total lifetime cost matters a lot more. Businesses will do the math and buy vehicles that minimize their cost. Automotive engineers will put more effort into reliability because fleet owners will have data to measure.<p>It&#x27;s a different world.

It can easily take a year or two to develop a product or internal tool.  Would you sign off on a big new performance-critical project in Java, knowing that you might not be able to get the performance you want when these low-level APIs are removed?<p>Java has had a bunch of security problems in the last few years, but most of them have not been related to Unsafe at all.  For example CVE-2013-0422 related to Java webapps, CVE-2013-4444 related to Tomcat, and so on.  There were a bunch of bugs for POODLE and other SSL issues, similar to many other programming languages.  Perhaps you could argue that CVE-2013-0422 was related to Unsafe, but since in this case it was an internal standard library class, presumably Oracle would continue to give itself permission to use whatever unsafe-equivalent they come up with.<p>If new APIs are needed are needed to replace uses of Unsafe, Oracle could simply add them gradually over time.

When a company gets large enough and depends on it enough, they will hire developers to actually fix and contribute to FOSS.  With almost all major projects, this is the case.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s really depressing to hear things like this and I feel I&#x27;m doing a disservice to the FOSS community for working at shitty companies like this even though I depend on the job to pay my bills.&quot;<p>How is it &#x27;shitty&#x27;?  FOSS is free.  Which means the freedom to use it and not contribute back.  It&#x27;s pretty shitty to put the blame on them for not giving back to the community.<p>Also, they are paying you to work there.",1436839678

9882424,comment,9880694,9881874,0,0,geofft,,,"Is there a risk of the untrusted host injecting things into the shell output without permission? It looks like there&#x27;s no authentication, so if I SSH somewhere untrusted that can output raw characters to my shell (which, I believe, includes git pushing over SSH, etc.), it can output the right escape sequence and insert false things into my shell history. With further cleverness, it could almost certainly inject things that <i>look</i> like commands I would have run but actually run evil things.<p>I don&#x27;t have a great solution to suggest for this. One option is to add some sort of per-user static password to the escape sequence, and insert it in the file that&#x27;s copied to each (trusted) host, but that just seems questionable. A better one might be to make the communication use a socket instead of an escape sequence, and forward the socket (recent OpenSSH can forward UNIX domain sockets) to trusted hosts, but that&#x27;s its own mess.<p>This is such a useful feature, though, especially with remote hosts. It&#x27;d be a pity if it can&#x27;t be done securely. :/<p>(While we&#x27;re on the subject of security, there&#x27;s an obscure attack involving interrupting the download of a `curl | sh` script -- which a MITM can do, even over SSH -- and relying on the shell to execute a partial command line. I learned about this from the Sandstorm folks, who have a workaround in <a href=""https://install.sandstorm.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://install.sandstorm.io/</a> involving the sh equivalent of an IIFE.)",1436839594

Hearing him talk about how there was no budget for raises while seeing his $100k car outside was definitely a bit of cognitive dissonance&quot;<p>Maybe.  But most employees don&#x27;t seem to care that:<p>1) the boss may have gotten the money to buy the car before owning the current company.  Most people in business have had multiple businesses throughout their lives.  Even if it&#x27;s not, they risked everything to create the company that now employs you.<p>2) The boss probably lost much more than the employees.  When an employee loses a job, it sucks.  But they can often times get unemployment and find another job (I&#x27;ve worked for plenty of companies that went under over the years).<p>The boss loses: money (if they are a co-owner, they probably invested money), reputation, and credit is possibly damaged.",1436839503

For instance, when I was at a large financial company, it needed to be something that was well established, with solid documentation and with professional support options (so, often this was something along the lines of professional open source). When I was with a consulting company, I was much more open to new frameworks as I might encounter clients using them or they might be suitable for some project.<p>When I am compiling my weekly update, it ends up being something that appears to have at least some decent documentation and the description sounds both useful and makes sense (you won&#x27;t believe how many libraries/frameworks I come across that I simply have no idea what they actually do or how they are different).<p>Anyway, all that is to say, I don&#x27;t know that there is one set of criteria that works for everyone and it is subjective anyway.

Use code.google.com/p/go.tools/go/types to process the AST and you&#x27;ll get basically the same information that the compiler sees. With that you can generate the code pretty easily. For comparison, our JSON code generator implementation is just ~350 lines and supports having different JSON representations for the same type, which vary depending on the container type.<p>Also, if you want to make the serialization faster you need to understand exactly what makes encoding/json slow (hint: is not only reflect) and remove all reasonable bottlenecks. You state that megajson does not support the MarshallJSON interface like that&#x27;s a bad thing, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s deliberate because it&#x27;s indeed a feature. When encoding/json encounters a type which implements MarshalJSON it does the following:<p>1 - Call MarshallJSON to obtain its JSON representation as []byte\n2 - Validate the produced JSON using a slower-than-the-bad&#x27;s-guy-horse function based state machine which processes each character individually\n3 - Copy the []byte returned by MarshallJSON to its own buffer<p>Unsurprisingly (after reading encoding/json&#x27;s code, of course) having a MarshalJSON method is way slower than letting encoding/json use reflection if the JSON you&#x27;re generating is anything but trivial and without almost any nesting, because it avoids extra allocations, copies and the validation step.",1396285056

But it&#x27;s something that goes from almost self-evident, to badly in need of being established.<p>On the other hand, the idea that a small handful of people have concentrated such vast wealth that they&#x27;ve disenfranchised the rest of us, a handful that is a great deal less than &quot;the 1%&quot;, is actually a wildly more potent political story. Even this here libertarian type might be open to some significant actions taken to ensure that such concentrations of wealth are ameliorated, as a key part of my personal libertarianism is that monopoly busting is a key useful function of government, and I&#x27;d consider this to fit in, if it is true. It&#x27;s still something that needs establishing, though, not mere assertion.<p>One has a hard time not imagining the .001% cackling with glee as the press focuses on &quot;the 1%&quot;; it still leaves them lost in crowd of millions, hardly singling them out for any treatment, while the 1% itself is peopled with a significant number of people who apparently worked their way up the ladder, however briefly that may have been. That doesn&#x27;t sound like a good set of people to target, if there&#x27;s no actual &quot;institution&quot; there.<p>And now, let me reiterate my first sentence; this is because of the political rhetoric being used. If it wasn&#x27;t for that, this would be a relatively uninteresting question. But if it&#x27;s going to become essentially part of the platform of one of the major parties, it&#x27;s worth examining for truth value.",1396284770

Quit trying to make the business a rousing success for a month or two, and just work 8-2 or 9-3 or whatever schedule works for you and keep the lights on. From 3 on, do the stuff you like to do. Seriously, hold yourself to it. Put it in a box and punch out at 2 or 3 pm or whenever.

That&#x27;s what makes healthcare very very different. It isn&#x27;t simply a &quot;product,&quot; it is a lifesaving measure.<p>>Don&#x27;t confuse &quot;health insurance&quot; (which ACA enforces purchase of) with &quot;health care&quot; (which, oddly, ACA doesn&#x27;t).<p>Of course I am not confusing the two, but if you don&#x27;t purchase health insurance, you can still get healthcare in some respect. If you cannot pay for it, then <i>someone</i> has to foot the bill.<p>If you are living, there is a good chance you will, at some time in your life, require healthcare past your ability to pay. Withholding care in the ER based on ability to pay or insurance status is already illegal (not to mention immoral). Requiring one to buy insurance to protect you, and everyone else, in that position isn&#x27;t in the same realm of most things.<p>Note: I don&#x27;t actually support the ACA because it is a very poor bandaid on a gushing wound with a lot of inefficiencies attached.<p>Note: most (if not all) States require car insurance as a requirement of owning and operating a motor vehicle. This is because operating a motor vehicle is dangerous and can potentially cause damage. There&#x27;s a chance you&#x27;ll cause damage beyond your ability to pay. Required insurance is to protect you and others, because a significant number of people will forgo insurance on their own.<p>However there is an arguably better chance of you getting sick or injured <i>sometime in your life</i> beyond your ability to pay than there is causing damage in a motor vehicle beyond your ability to pay.",1396284246

7502518,comment,7501570,7502254,13,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>What&#x27;s so horrible about JavaScript? Could you give a few examples?</i><p>I don&#x27;t want to bore everyone with some huge post, but among other things:<p>1. It&#x27;s full of awkward edge cases. (See the &#x27;Wat?&#x27; talk for numerous examples.) This is bad generally, and terrible if you want to use the language as a least common denominator foundation on which other languages and tools might be built.<p>2. It has little if any meaningful support for things like modularity, composition, separation of interface from implementation, and other basic software development good practices.<p>3. It is highly dynamic. This is good for prototyping and small, quick enhancements to web pages, which is what we used to use JS for. However, it is not good for building stable, robust, secure, large-scale systems that will be built and maintained by lots of people over extended periods, which is what we (reportedly) want to do with the Web now.<p>4. It doesn&#x27;t work like any other major programming language. Hardly anyone seems to use prototype-based inheritance well, and most of those who do are probably experts working on libraries rather than everyday web developers. It seems more common for people to try and use class-style OO with JS, first resulting in a lot of ugly hacks, and I gather soon resulting in various syntactic sugar being built into a future version of the language, making this area not just esoteric but also more complicated. Don&#x27;t even get me started on function-based scoping rules, whose primary functions in JavaScript appear to be being abused to make up for the lack of any sane module system and causing frustration to JS beginners whose loops don&#x27;t do what they &quot;obviously&quot; should (and would in just about any other mainstream language).<p><i>With custom elements, we can extend that simple language to our liking. There are no bounds anymore.</i><p>Not really. You can add new vocabulary, but you can&#x27;t change the grammar. In particular, you&#x27;re still essentially assuming that the application is built around one big hierarchy of elements in a DOM. Except that then we get to Shadow DOM to try and work around that. And now we&#x27;re back to trying to do modularity, but making what should be a trivial and widely used concept absurdly overcomplicated. Again.<p><i>Problem? We write in Sass/Less/Stylus/etc. which are capable languages that are continuously improved.</i><p>Sure, and so do I. But no matter which preprocessing tools we use, CSS is still woefully underpowered for designing even moderately complicated web pages, never mind full-on user interfaces, and while SASS and the like are great for things like shorthand notations/macros, they ultimately still get turned into CSS and rely on its limited/broken models.<p>At least these days we can use box-sizing to fix one of the long-standing headaches, but we still rely on abuses like combining floats and negative margins to set up layouts. You still can&#x27;t specify even very simple dynamic layouts that adapt to the actual size of content; a lot of Web developers still think a concept as simple Responsive Design is clever, because in Web world it is, but UI designers building native applications have been working around similar problems for several decades.<p>For that matter, a bunch of awkward dependencies still exist between CSS and the order of elements you give in HTML, so you <i>can&#x27;t</i> fully separate content from presentation and keep your layout away from the content you put in it. Consider the impact of order of mark-up on how floats are rendered, for example, or the need for extra wrapper elements so you can set position:fubar on things to get your latest layout hack to work. Web Components offer various tools for hiding some of this, but the same junk is still happening under the hood, and it&#x27;s still creating complexity for both those who develop the components and those who write the browsers.<p><i>What do you mean? You can separate [content, presentation and behaviour] just fine.</i><p>No, you can&#x27;t. You might think you can, but every now and then you run into the kinds of examples I mentioned above, which you can&#x27;t fix because the underlying HTML and CSS models were designed for a different purpose and are broken for what you want to do with them. Then you have to resort to JS to work around the problem, which is time-consuming and gives up the whole idea of specifying a layout and then putting the content into it in the way we&#x27;re usually trying to.<p><i>npm is full of tools for this. You can have modularity in your source code and rely on tasks to package it for production.</i><p>But npm doesn&#x27;t run in browsers, so now everything is complicated by yet another up-front build tool, which seems to be the modern web developer&#x27;s answer to everything. And sure, it works, as long as someone is wasting huge amounts of time writing and maintaining all those tools, and as long as the tools always work properly, and as long as everyone knows how to use them, and as long as everyone agrees on which &quot;them&quot; to use, and a whole bunch of other overheads that are a systemic drain on the efficiency of the entire development process.<p>The thing is, I shouldn&#x27;t have to rely on a bunch of infrastructure to do something as simple as writing modular code for a large-scale application. It should be a completely stable, simple, universally applicable feature in any serious programming language, and doing things like making code available as a module with a clearly defined interface or accessing code from somewhere else via that interface should be one-liners. JavaScript, and the numerous related tools from npm to RequireJS via who even knows how many others now, aren&#x27;t even in operating the same universe as I&#x27;m describing.<p>Also, please note that I wasn&#x27;t just talking about JavaScript there. Both HTML and CSS have related problems, and again, while there are some changes in the works to help work around these issues, the basic models are fundamentally broken. Why should any serious, large-scale application start from the idea that a single page of mark-up/single DOM should be the foundation on which everything else, including any code and stylesheets and other HTML/DOM data for different parts of the system, should be found? The entire premise is kind of absurd, if you stop and think about it, but because the Web offers us no real alternative today, the average Web designer/developer doesn&#x27;t get that far or just resigns themselves to dealing with it anyway...<p>Edit: I see the parent post has grown some more questions while I wrote this, but this post is way too long already so I don&#x27;t think I should extend it any more.",1396284068

There&#x27;s an excellent free book available here: <a href=""http://book.seaside.st/book"" rel=""nofollow"">http://book.seaside.st/book</a><p>While it&#x27;s not explicitly an OO tutorial it was really helpful for me, coming from a web development background, to better understand how ideas like inheritance play out in a real application. Seaside is a component-based framework, so ideas like instances and subclassing objects with different features were very concrete. On top of that, when viewing the site in your browser in dev mode you can click on any component and explore its state.<p>Of course one also has to pick up Smalltalk for this to work out, so it does require a particular commitment! But Smalltalk itself is a great way to learn OO, as it&#x27;s based entirely around objects and messages, using a very simple syntax. Even if other OO languages don&#x27;t fully adhere to this idea, it&#x27;s still helpful when moving on to other ones. A great way to learn Smalltalk is Pharo by Example. <a href=""http://pharobyexample.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pharobyexample.org/</a>  Actually, one could just use this on its own to learn OO.

Generated code is faster but less convenient, because it adds steps to your compile.  And you pay this compile-time overhead for every message type you want to manipulate.  The pain of this generated code was one of Kenton Varda&#x27;s motivations for creating Cap&#x27;n Proto after working on Protocol Buffers for years.  Unlike Protocol Buffers, Cap&#x27;n Proto doesn&#x27;t need to generate parsing/serialization code because its serialization format also works as an in-memory format.<p>I have taken a somewhat different approach to the problem, with my Protocol Buffer / JSON / etc. serialization framework upb (<a href=""https://github.com/haberman/upb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/haberman/upb</a>).  Instead of using static code generation, I use a JIT approach where I generate specialized code on-the-fly.

And if the performance is IO-bound (e.g. communicating with their server), there might be a negligible difference anyway. Also, being high-level can give a big advantage in development time and bug prevention which is more likely than response time to be where things get difficult.",1396281837

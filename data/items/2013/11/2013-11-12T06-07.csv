6716252,comment,6715864,6715864,16,0,dakrisht,,,"Great little read. Uniquely portrays the cultural differences between the two schools but more importantly, shows just how different the West vs. East Coast mentality is when it comes to technology startups, products, innovations, etc.<p>Not saying there isn&#x27;t much &quot;pure technology&quot; coming out of Stanford (there most certainly is) but you get the feeling that Boston-area startups are wired to find, as Peter Thiel would say, the 0 to 1 markets vs. the 1 to n markets of globalization (the West Coast).<p>In Boston, there appears to be a bigger emphasis on hi-tech vs. the latest subscription service or cloud provider coming from SV. But the SV culture encourages that, VC&#x27;s cut checks for products with &quot;traction&quot; and more often than not, skip pure technology (be it medical devices, therapeutics, chemicals, hardware, and hard/expensive/timely ventures).<p>This is rather unfortunate since we are in need of better startup companies and technologies, and they are in need of funding. There are many reasons for this (one being the &quot;easy way out biz model replication&quot; phenomenon used in the ammonia subscription model example in the post). And another is the lack of talent, particularly great talent going to well-funded SnapChat #4 and other similar, non-groundbreaking companies.<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see the face of venture capital changing much with regards to funding innovative and risky technologies. They of course are wired to big returns on 1/100 social company exits (most at least) and &quot;technology&quot; doesn&#x27;t really matter (again, to most).<p>Can you imagine SV putting money into Fairchild Semiconductor or Intel today? Won&#x27;t happen.<p>Don&#x27;t let the excuses of &quot;we infested in Barracuda and Cisco&quot; fool you - the focus is on &quot;how many users do you have for the latest hype driven app on the App Store.&quot;<p>I think the major problem is the lack of risk being taken on great technology vs. the easy way out. AKA, some VCs should grow some balls and invest in the future vs. the very-near future. Being an MBA out of a top-10 school and having check writing power to fund &quot;startups&quot; is also a negative since a lot of these guys know the spreadsheets - NOT the silicon.<p>But I digress.<p>Both schools are unique in their culture but share similarities in brilliance. The best outcome is too see great business as marketing intersect with powerful technology. Then we can have real great companies on the horizon again. As a West Coast founder myself, it&#x27;s actually an honor and a humbling experience to be working with people from both schools and it&#x27;s clear as day just how different the mindset is.",1384238615

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8nXRQQ0bjA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8nXRQQ0bjA</a><p>Mostly Django user attempting to ask from outside the Node/server-side js community for an explanation of why we&#x27;re invoking &quot;isomorphic&quot; here:
As far as what&#x27;s going on, are we just saying that the js for rendering the page is equally capable of talking to the API and doing the DOM work while running on the server as it is when downloaded, interpreted, JIT&#x27;d etc before fetching the actual request content?  Does this mostly eliminate an extra RTT to the API if the js/web application server experience relatively zero RTT due to network/physical proximity to the API server?  Does this incidentally make SEO possible while having fat clients and server-side initialization all in one setting and with mostly one code base?<p>Assuming I&#x27;m on track, working backwards towards understanding the implementation as it relates to &quot;isomorphic&quot;, if a program&#x27;s output state is a valid input state to initialize the program (we&#x27;re talking fat, stateful MVC clients after all) state, then all that&#x27;s needed to re-create the entire execution state of the current program is to copy itself into the output in such a way that it will be run upon receipt (we link js files in the page).  I&#x27;m going to take a wild guess that the output state of the client doesn&#x27;t have the necessary template tags etc used when a cold page is rendered, server or client-side, so the server has to serialize some of the state and pump it into the copy of the program to make it as if the client we&#x27;re sending is the client that rendered the page, keeping the client&#x27;s internal representation consistent with the state of the page.<p>If this is true, we&#x27;re taking a program that cannot be initialized from it&#x27;s own output and modifying it to be a program that achieves the same effect.  JS is modifying JS, and is therefore said to be &quot;isomorphic?&quot;  It still sounds like a glorified way to describe a serialized execution state, one that happens to involve a program in a language outputting a valid program in the same language, but the purpose is to achieve the effect, as far as the developer is concerned, that the output is a valid input, albeit with an intermediate technique to make the abstraction hold water.<p>If I&#x27;m on track, then I have to say it&#x27;s rather as if we have a fat client, output of one render, serialized client state (because the DOM is not sufficient to re-create the program state or else our client js has to initialize from one format that&#x27;s programmer friendly and one that&#x27;s program-friendly), and necessarily a third-leg responsible for injecting the client js and serialized state as js into the output.<p>Standing to see the mauve dusk of my life against the impending rain of spears and arrows, I must ask if we can not simply call the js necessary to achieve the equivalent state of running everything client side a &quot;continuation&quot; and call the entire technique &quot;client continuation programming?&quot; with it implicitly understood that creating the continuation involves a third piece of program?  I&#x27;m prepared to die.  I just want to know.",1384237701

And you must demonstrate you could not make the point you were making without using that specific work as source material, usually because your commentary was about that work. In my non-attorney opinion this is closest to Rap Genius&#x27;s scenario, but if you try for this and lose, your work can be considered derivative work and is wholly owned by the original copyright holder.<p>4) In general, it makes you less sympathetic when you mount a fair use defense while profiting from republishing the work, although that isn&#x27;t a strict identifier.<p>5) As mentioned elsewhere on this thread, Rap Genius and other lyrics sites aren&#x27;t publishing the lyrics to just one song, the lyrics are the core content of the site.

They may have some price advantage, but price is generally less important in Japan than it is in other countries, and is often rather obscured in phone contracts.  Samsung coming in 4th is actually a vote of confidence.<p>To the degree there&#x27;s a bias in Japan against non-Japanese products, I think it&#x27;s in most cases less a case of xenophobia, and more simply a higher degree of trust in Japanese products.  This isn&#x27;t entirely illogical either, as Japan does have a very good record of building high-quality products.  Japanese can be very, very, picky, about both quality and style.  [This is one reason Apple does very well in Japan.]",1384236504

7792438,comment,7791900,7792313,13,0,TheHydroImpulse,,,"Error handling in Rust is actually pretty awesome. There&#x27;s a standard `Result<T, E>` type. One can write a potentially fail-able function like:<p><pre><code>    fn can_fail(arg: bool) -> Result<(), StrBuf> {\n        if arg {\n            Ok(())\n        } else {\n            Err(StrBuf::from_str(&quot;Oops! Something went wrong.&quot;))\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nHere, there&#x27;s no value when the function succeeds `()`. When it fails (I don&#x27;t mean fail as in a `fail!()` or a panic or anything), you get a string back.<p>You can pattern match the return value:<p><pre><code>    match can_fail(true) {\n        Ok(_) => {},\n        Err(err) => {}\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis can get quite cumbersome, however. That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s a `try!` macro that adds composability. The idea is that if you have a function returning a `Result`, wherever that function is being called could also return a `Result`.<p><pre><code>     fn higher_up() -> Result<(), StrBuf> {\n         try!(can_fail(true));\n     }\n</code></pre>\n`try!` is simply:<p><pre><code>    match $e { Ok(e) => e, Err(e) => return Err(e) }\n</code></pre>\nThis allows error to propagate up the chain.<p>When you&#x27;re working in big-ish projects, it&#x27;d be best to have something better than a simple `StrBuf` for an error. You&#x27;d probably want a struct:<p><pre><code>    pub struct LibError {\n        message: StrBuf,\n        error: Error\n    }\n\n    pub enum Error {\n        One,\n        Two,\n        Three\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWhere `Lib` is the library/project name.<p>You can then create a new result type based on your new error type:<p><pre><code>    type LibResult<T> = Result<T, LibError>;\n</code></pre>\nThen you can use `LibResult<T>` everywhere in your app.<p>You can view this example done in a few of my own libraries (<a href=""https://github.com/TheHydroImpulse/gossip.rs/blob/master/src/gossip/util.rs#L14"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/TheHydroImpulse/gossip.rs/blob/master/src...</a>) and cargo (<a href=""https://github.com/carlhuda/cargo/blob/master/src/cargo/util/result.rs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/carlhuda/cargo/blob/master/src/cargo/util...</a>).<p>That&#x27;s a simple overview of it. Error handling is super simple, not verbose (thanks to try!) and in your control. Because of Rust&#x27;s type system, things like `Result<T, E>` is available and are so much better than simple return values (like integers: -1 vs 0 uhhh)",1400899177

7792433,comment,7791900,7792128,5,0,kibwen,,,"Tuple structs aren&#x27;t used often, but the whole point of them is to force you to name a type. The idea is to <i>restrict</i> the types that you can call a function with; it turns a given tuple from a structural type to a nominal type.<p>For example, say you have two functions, where each function takes a single tuple of two floating point numbers:<p><pre><code>  // Converts a Cartesian coordinate to a polar coordinate\n  fn to_polar(coord: (f64, f64)) -> (f64, f64) { ... }\n\n  // Calculates the area of a rectangle\n  fn area(rect: (f64, f64)) -> f64 { ... }\n</code></pre>\nNow, if you have a tuple that represents a coordinate, perhaps you don&#x27;t want to feed it to the `area` function. Likewise for feeding a rectangle to the `to_polar` function. But because tuples are just structural types, something like `area(to_polar((2.5, 3.7))` is completely legal.<p>If you <i>didn&#x27;t</i> want to allow this, or even if you just wanted to have greater control over all these anonymous tuples floating around, you&#x27;d use tuple structs to give them names:<p><pre><code>  struct CarteCoord(f64, f64);\n  struct PolarCoord(f64, f64);\n  struct Rectangle(f64, f64);\n  struct Area(f64);  // bonus round!\n\n  fn to_polar(coord: CarteCoord) -> PolarCoord { ... }\n  fn area(rect: Rectangle) -> Area { ... }\n</code></pre>\nTaking the above steps makes `area(to_polar(CarteCoord(2.5, 3.7)))` a compile-time error. It&#x27;s all about how strict you want to be with your types.",1400899039

Aaron Swartz is proof. What the AO, FBI, Secret Service and DOJ did to him is the icky part, not this lawsuit.<p>PlainSite makes use of RECAP and archive.org&#x27;s infrastructure, and I&#x27;m working with them on a new project as well.

If that doesn&#x27;t show the content, then I go back --- there&#x27;s plenty of other sites out there, if you don&#x27;t make it easy to read your content I&#x27;ll just go somewhere else where I can find the same thing.<p>At least with Google Groups it seems some of it is readable without JS now -- e.g. try this link with JS off: <a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/forum/comp.lang.python"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/d/forum/comp.lang.python</a>",1400896966

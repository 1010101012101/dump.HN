Twitter has gotten some incredible publicity lately, so much so that my <i>mom</i> asked me what Twitter was.<p>So perhaps that is why the Times asked Evan Williams write a sort of autobiography.  But nothing was really all that meaningful.<p>He could have talked about why he believed giving investors their money back was the right decision. He could have talked about why Twitter was worth investing more time in.  He could have even talked about what he learned from his previous failures.<p>Evan Williams doesn't sound like that interesting of a person, but props to him for developing one of the next big things in online communication.",1236468810

Blogger he already sold. Twitter he may.<p>Another way to look at it is, Twitter may have been already acquired by Google had not Evan Williams already had one company bought by Google. This may have stopped it from getting to the point it is now judging by some companies success after that event.<p>One major success is probably lucky, TWO is probably skill, or else a complete craziness by consumers.  But what it is looking like is Evan Williams has created 2 successful companies in one bubble and coming out the end of the bubble it appears twitter might have some of the best value built in.",1236468594

I had already failed at a half-startup.  I was doing consulting for another startup called Siteadvisor.  Etc.<p>Yet YC was the catalyst for dropping out of grad school.<p>Paul certainly gets a unique view into startup creation.  I just wonder what the second and third order terms are of this equation.",1236468251

Whenever I need to get my 150MB files, I'll go to your site!<p>In seriousness, I don't know what the price for amazon ec2 works out to be.  However, during the development phase, it is too expensive.  I believe it will cost you $72 to run an instance for a month, base price.  I would suggest something like slicehost if all you need is a low power server instance for development, and then look at ec2.",1236467251

4648408,comment,4642810,4642810,1,0,anujkk,,,"If you don't have contacts then make contacts. If you don't have anything to show, then make something to show.<p>If you are a developer/designer, here are some suggestions:<p>1. Don't leave your existing job unless you have enough money in bank to sustain for a year or two.<p>2. If you don't have projects to show in your portfolio, then do some projects. There are endless possibilities. You can make and sell themes(wordpress/shopify/etc), html templates, plugins, mobile apps, etc. You can also offer free development/design services to some startups in need[1]. You can take some existing popular website and redesign it for better UX.<p>3. Get your own website. Put your Projects/CV/Blog on it. Write blog posts related to your area of expertise. e.g., on UX design, how to do <something> with <xyz> language, etc.<p>4. Answer questions on sites like stackoverflow, quora, HN, reddit. Build your online reputation and contacts. Don't hesitate in sending mails and communicating with people you meet online. Ofcourse, don't spam.<p>5. Attend meetups. Not only technology meetups but any meetup that you can attend and possibly find clients.<p>6. Share your business card with people you meet. Tell them about what you do(freelancing). Ask them what they do. Think what you can do to make their life a bit easier.<p>7. Still if you don't have any projects, if possible, make small SAAS or Open Source products that can be of any use to someone.<p>It may take time. You need to toil hard. So have patience and keep working. :)<p>-------------------------------------------------------<p>[1] Here are some examples :<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1842768"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1842768</a> and its follow up : <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1860130"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1860130</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1838273"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1838273</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1838033"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1838033</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1836998"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1836998</a>",1350129392

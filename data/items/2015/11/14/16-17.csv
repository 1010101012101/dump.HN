It&#x27;s a messy abstraction, but there&#x27;s some meaning behind it, because things can at least be relatively sorted by how external or internally based they are. For example, you may see a spider which 99.99% of sighted individuals would also see and agree there was a spider there, or you can hallucinate one, where only you would agree about a spider being present. Clearly the first is MORE externally based than the latter.",1447520397

I&#x27;m going to over 75% cash right now.  If the market drops 20% then I&#x27;m going to slowly start dollar cash averaging in to see if it trends back up.  If it doesn&#x27;t I&#x27;m just going to stay cash heavy.<p>If I had been smart enough to buy Google, Facebook, or Amazon a few years ago I would be taking some or maybe all profits there.  If Apple goes below 100 I will start buying again and possibly selling covered calls on it.<p>My IRA&#x27;s have a really long time horizon so although I&#x27;m still putting cash in them every month I&#x27;m not buying anything.

What we&#x27;re hearing is the positions that were prepared prior to the attacks themselves.<p>It&#x27;s possible that the perpetrators evaded surveillance with encryption. It&#x27;s also possible that the perpetrators did have their phones tapped, but investigators dropped the ball. It&#x27;s possible that they avoided phones and did all their planning in person. It&#x27;s even possible that someone made an executive decision to not intervene and stop them, for political reasons.<p>As far as I know, none of Snowden&#x27;s criticisms have been addressed at French organizations.

I think a better parallel is the Dan Egerstad case.<p>Here&#x27;s why it&#x27;s worse: they inserted a plaintext encoding into the response from the onion-address lookup relay, and so anybody observing the user (e.g. the ISP) could detect what onion address the user was connecting to. This applies after the fact to recorded traffic as well.  Thus the researchers had no control over who got deanonymized, to whom they were deanonymized, and when they were deanonymized.<p>> I do wish both sides would acknowledge this is a tricky issue. On the one hand, if I run a tor exit node or relay, it is my node and it seems like I&#x27;m allowed to do with it as I please.<p>You actually are not allowed to do with your relay as you please. At least in the US, the legal theory protecting relay operators (i.e. safe harbor) also makes it illegal to observe user traffic content except in certain cases (e.g. to improve network performance).<p>> One other thing to keep in mind here is that SEI is a DoD funded center.<p>This doesn&#x27;t seem very relevant. All researchers have an obligation to consider and mitigate possible harms that occur during their research (source: I work in a military research laboratory). These researchers clearly did not fulfill that obligation, and I&#x27;m sure their institution is reviewing or has reviewed their procedures to make sure it doesn&#x27;t happen again.",1447519504

First, the fencepost error. While SF and NYC have two timezones in between, neither city is on the furthest edge of its timezone. With better knowledge, an estimate of 3.5 is more correct, giving (24/3.5)<i>3000/(2 pi) = 3274 miles.<p>Second, 3,000 miles is the driving distance, not the great circle distance, which is only 2,500 miles.

Still, I think 3,000 miles is good for the ballpark estimate you made, and it&#x27;s certainly not a fact I have at hand.<p>Third, those two cities lie at about 40 N latitude, so you computed the length of that latitude, not the length of the equator. You need to divide by cos(40 degrees). cos(45 degrees) is sqrt(2)/2 = 0.707, so I&#x27;ll use 0.75. (24/3.5)*2500/(2 pi)/0.75 = 3637.",1447519387

Harsh regimes all — but far less draconian than our Saudi allies, and other tyrannies around the world. What has been the result of these interventions? A hell on earth, one that grows wider and more virulent year after year.<p>Without the American crime of aggressive war against Iraq — which, by the measurements used by Western governments themselves, left more than a million innocent people dead — there would be no ISIS, no “Al Qaeda in Iraq.” Without the Saudi and Western funding and arming of an amalgam of extremist Sunni groups across the Middle East, used as proxies to strike at Iran and its allies, there would be no ISIS. Let’s go back further. Without the direct, extensive and deliberate creation by the United States and its Saudi ally of a world-wide movement of armed Sunni extremists during the Carter and Reagan administrations, there would have been no “War on Terror” — and no terrorist attacks in Paris tonight.<p>Again, let’s be as clear as possible: the hellish world we live in today is the result of deliberate policies and actions undertaken by the United States and its allies over the past decades. It was Washington that led and/or supported the quashing of secular political resistance across the Middle East, in order to bring recalcitrant leaders like Nasser to heel and to back corrupt and brutal dictators who would advance the US agenda of political domination and resource exploitation.<p>The open history of the last half-century is very clear in this regard. Going all the way back to the overthrow of the democratic government of Iran in 1953, the United States has deliberately and consciously pushed the most extreme sectarian groups in order to undermine a broader-based secular resistance to its domination agenda.<p>Why bring up this “ancient history” when fresh blood is running in the streets of Paris?

10566161,comment,10554479,10554479,0,0,SimplyUseless,,,"Summary of key discussions:<p>==========================<p>If you&#x27;re just an average user concerned about your privacy<p>1) Use Tor when browsing.You don&#x27;t have to use Tor all the time (it does slow things down considerably and some sites will also block Tor traffic). But if you are looking at or for something that you feel is sensitive, then either set up your browser to work with Tor or use the Tor browser.<p>2) Use an ad-blocker. Says Snowden: &quot;As long as service providers are serving ads with active content that require the use of Javascript to display, that have some kind of active content like Flash embedded in it, anything that can be a vector for attack in your web browser – you should be actively trying to block these.&quot;<p>3) Use a password manager. It doesn&#x27;t matter how many surveys and reports come out that tell people to use different passwords and complex passwords, a huge percentage of us maintain borderline idiotic approaches. The simple answer is: get a password manager. It will protect you.<p>4) Use two-factor authentication. Many services such as Gmail, Twitter, Dropbox, Hotmail, and Facebook offer this now for no charge. So even if your password does get exposed, you still have a backup such as a text message to your phone to secure your information.<p>5) Use apps that protect your information. Snowden suggests the smartphone app Signal, which encrypts both your phone calls and texts. It&#x27;s free and easy to use. Although of course, following a high-profile argument with the FBI, it would appear that Apple&#x27;s messaging service is also pretty secure (although Snowden would probably have doubts).<p>6) Use the HTTPS Everywhere browser plug-in. This comes from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and will try to force all browser communication to be encrypted.<p>7) Encrypt your hard drive. This is comparatively easy these days but you have to be careful to do two things: one, have a longish phrase to make it worthwhile; and two, make damn sure you remember that phrase. There will be a slowdown in performance but nothing too bad if you have a modern machine.<p>8) Be smart with your security questions. Stop using your mother&#x27;s maiden name for everything. Likewise your first school. The key is to mix things up as much as possible so if someone does get into one of your accounts, they can&#x27;t use the same information to get in everywhere else.",1447518520

And perhaps in a broader sense targeting people in particular socio-economic groups might also be useful (jobless, young, low education,etc.).<p>The way I see it, targeted surveillance of these at-risk groups should be possible, and specifically in relation to terrorism or extremism in general it might even be effective. There are volumes of studies on how radicalization occurs, or how cults work, and what problems are caused by jobless young men disconnected from society around them (both by upbringing and through various forms of racism/classism, hidden or otherwise). The process is not exactly mysterious.<p>That said, I get the impression that there&#x27;s a huge gap between what researchers know about these processes, and how this is used by police, &#x27;neighborhood watchers&#x27;, and schools, and possibly even intelligence agencies.<p>I&#x27;ll also add that regardless of how effective targeted surveillance might be, on a &#x27;gut&#x27; level I feel uncomfortable with this scenario and would not be in favor of it. I can&#x27;t quite articulate why at this point, but personally I&#x27;d still prefer not significantly changing our way of life over the, so far, infrequent terrorist attacks. Perhaps the best answer is to simply not let it phase us and continue with life. Most other solutions feel like (partly) playing into the hands of terrorists. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a realistic option, sadly, and perhaps it&#x27;s easy for me to say these things without having felt the effects of such terrorist attacks personally.",1447517068

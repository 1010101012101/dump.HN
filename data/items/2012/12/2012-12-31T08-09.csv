 - attempt to linearly reduce the number of tests within each subset<p>However this doesn't seem to be sufficient when dealing with more difficult problems. And there isn't a step-by-step guide to solving any type of problem...

There exists no such popular and lively platform for web app discovery, review, and sales.<p>- <i>Browser and OS Dependency.</i> Mobile browsers don't all allow access to the camera, easy installation to the home screen, and all the access to APIs a full-featured app should have.<p>So let us be constructive from now on, and focus on fixing these issues, instead of giving up and locking ourselves into reliance on yet another company (Flash, iOS, Android, etc).",1356943193

Things you can buy easily (games, apps, content) is all cheap and single serve (< $10 per purchase)<p>It's not a coincidence that most mobile purchases were made from iPads this holiday season. Plenty of other tablets still offer a substandard browsing experience and the more obstacles you hit, the more likely you are to abandon purchasing on your mobile device and switch to a desktop.<p>It also helps that most online retailers factor in how their site performs on an iPad at this point. You can't just sweep how iOS based devices continue to trounce Android based devices in terms of showing up in weblogs under the rug. Even on a more modern device like a Galaxy S III running up-to-date Chrome, it's a noticeably worse experience.<p>It's a vicious cycle. They don't show up in logs frequently enough, so the experience doesn't improve (in fact in many cases it gets worse), which in turn results in less attempts which continues to validate the company not offering good support, and so on.

Well, you have to ask ""What are they REALLY hiring the consultants for for?""<p>Probably a third of the jobs I was hired for, inside large companies (and particularly corporate-y startups), were clearly (to me) about CYA. ""Hey, we're doing something, look at all the money we're spending on consultants!"" When you go in, as I did, trying to actually do a great job, this becomes incredibly disheartening. One more reason I came to loathe consulting. However, in that case, given the actual (unstated) goal, I was able to be very ""effective"" for the client, despite the fact that no matter what I did, they wasted endless hours of my & my partner's time at $500+/hr total. $2k on a meeting? Sure, why not? Changing ""project managers"" every week? Hey, why not? Putting a glorified secretary in charge of signing off on user interface designs? Sounds grrreat!<p>And yet for their purpose I was a tool they used effectively. Bummer.<p>Wasn't just me, either. Do you remember that ""shocking"" post a while back by an anonymous ex-McKinsey consultant? He detailed how McK hires kids out of college with no experience and gives them jobs pumping out Powerpoints to client specifications. That doesn't sound so bad, put that way, but he meant that he was told what outcome the client wanted to see, and that he should make the data (and the presentation) come to that conclusion. Given my experience consulting, I wasn't at all surprised (although it's a different type of consulting and I was never dishonest to a client).<p>We assume clients are rational actors, but they're not. They're people. And people often do things for all the wrong reasons. They will pay somebody to tell them what they want to hear; they'll pay somebody to look good; they'll pay somebody to listen to them, to have somebody have to obey them and their wishes on topics they know nothing about, because nobody listens to them usually.<p>As notable consultant Jerry Weinberg wrote, ""No matter how it looks at first, it's always a people problem.""

Art costs for mobile games, including many of the top earners, are not particularly high. Compared to marketing and programming costs art won't cost a fortune for nearly any mobile game.</i><p>It depends on what sort of game you're looking for. If you're looking to build a <i>simple</i> mobile game, sure, art costs are pretty low. It doesn't take much to build a physics game for casuals or a Skinner box like <i>Tiny Tower</i>, for sure. It takes a lot more if you want to build something for anything even remotely approaching the ""core"" audience--the people who play games as games, who normally don't play many games on mobile because the games by and large aren't very good and aren't very engrossing. And it's not because these games are for shallow people (though many could be accused of that), but rather because if you aren't making a game with ten elements and a bunch of generic reusable pieces, it's just gonna cost money.<p>Like, I'm working on a 2D RPG in my spare time. I've sketched it out with an aim toward 25-30 hours of content (something almost unheard-of in mobile games, though I'm also aiming towards Windows as well so I'm cheating a bit). I've looked extensively, I've scrimped where I could, and the inescapable rolling boulder of <i>needing stuff</i> means I'm still looking at $20K or so in terms of asset creation. That's not expensive for the game mills like Gameloft, but it's pretty brutal for a one-guy show, and unless I can do something to alleviate it[1] is going to result in a worse game that doesn't reach what I'm aiming for. (If I was making this to make money I'd be a lot more worried about it. I'm making it because I love games. It will break even, eventually, if I port it to enough platforms--but it may never finance a second, even with my day job soaking my personal expenses. I'm okay with that, but it constrains what I can do.)<p>But, yeah, if you want to roll with people making games for gamers, you are <i>going</i> to be spending a large chunk of cash. He's not wrong here, you're just assuming he's looking at the ""top earners"" and not, y'know--stuff that people normally called ""gamers"" want to play.<p>[1] - There are some great games out there that rely on ""space savers"" like procedural generation--Nethack, Dwarf Fortress, Minecraft--but there are itches they can't scratch. People jonesing for a Narrativist game, if I can slightly misuse a term from the Big Model, are going to want a game where they can see what they're doing and are not going to want to look at the same five wall textures and ten palette-swapped enemies everywhere they go. It's just the way it is.<p>.<p><i>> On the other end of the power spectrum, OUYA was a mega-success in terms of people voting with their wallets.</i><p>The other I wanted to poke at: OUYA has succeeded in getting a lot of people to buy an undergunned Android set-top box for something at or very near cost. It has not succeeded in getting them to re-buy a bunch of games that they probably already have on another platform, especially given their super dodgy practice of polling for games people want to see and then ""which do you <i>really</i> want?"" with a list of AAA games[2]--it's not an illegal practice or anything by any stretch, but the way they've played this has explicitly tried to set expectations that have little to do with the actual machine or the games it's going to get.<p>I personally can't see this ending well, and I say that with an eye towards developing for it--because I can't see it making a dime for me because I'm not hawking <i>Mass Effect</i> or <i>Skyrim</i>.<p>[2] - <a href=""https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/ouyatop20"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/ouyatop20</a>",1356941241

(I've... actually done it quite recently, but that was a combination of me making an extraordinarily unwise choice (Oh, I can get by with a used chassis/backplane, even though it's a brand I don't normally use, and a design I'm probably not qualified to re-qualify, no problem!)  and me being an idiot when it came time to force-reassemble the RAID (I still don't have good docs on this, but one of my people now understands the problem of what data is on what drive, and what order to list drives during the force very well.   I just need to get them to document.  Or, really, I should sit down with them, really understand it, simulate a similar failure, and then document it myself.  For now we've instituted a policy that two people need to sign off before using force with any mdadm command.)<p>I mean, if you are using conventional RAID, you need to keep spares.   heck, you could run a 36 bay raid, and just designate, say, 4 spares, and 90% of the time, you'd want to replace the whole chassis before you ran out of spares.  But now we're paying what, another 10% for disks?  (the disks completely dominate the cost of cheap storage arrays;  really nice 36 bay chassis[1] with room for a motherboard cost well under $1500.  for a few bones more, you can get a similar chassis with 45 disks and no slot for a motherboard...  And, of course, you can go way cheaper than that if you are willing to resort to disks that can't be swapped... but my point is that the cost of the chassis, even those nice supermicro chassis where all disks can be swapped without de-racking the thing, is already way below the cost of the disks you are throwing in it, so buying more disks in exchange for getting a cheaper chassis is likely a false economy.<p>I mean, you do have a point when it comes to labour... it is a big deal to get someone to swap a drive (and if you don't have a spare, the swap needs to happen right quick)<p>and yeah, swapping drives isn't without danger.<p>Now, the economics of this changes if you have some CEPH like system where you can fail an arbitrary number of drives in one chassis and still have the good drives function.   But those systems are all relatively new, and have quite a lot of complexity overhead.  I mean, in theory, if you have an array half full of good disks, with such a system you could migrate that data to a new array completely full of good disks, then remove and refurb the array that is half bad, but want to talk about complexity and chances to screw it up?  yeah.<p>Also note, most drives I buy come with a warranty, meaning a bad disk is a token that is good for one completely free disk.  'enterprise' disks don't fall in price nearly as fast as consumer grade disks (yeah, go find me a 500gb 'enterprise' 3.5"" 7200rpm disk for under $70 that isn't used or refurbished.   Yeah, that's what I thought.)   And often, if you warranty a really obsolete drive, you get back one that is fairly newish.  I've warrantied a bunch of WD re3 drives and gotten back re4 kit (difference is that re4 has larger cache and fewer platters, meaning fewer/lighter r/w heads, meaning better seeks and, of course, fewer platters means less spinning weight and thus less power consumption.)<p>Of course, that's not a factor if you buy your drives without warranty.  I don't know any way to extract even the shipping cost out of bad drives that have no warranty.  (If you do, lemme know;  I'm giving 'em away right now.  Hell, half of 'em could be resold by unscrupulous folks;  I discard drives once they start showing uncorrectable read errors, even if there is enough space to remap the bad sector, while some people don't replace the drive until they run out of space to see bad sectors (e.g. you will then start seeing /consistent/ bad sectors across badblocks runs.)<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.supermicro.com/products/chassis/4U/847/SC847A-R1400LP.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.supermicro.com/products/chassis/4U/847/SC847A-R14...</a>",1356941191

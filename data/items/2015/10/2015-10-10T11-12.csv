They might get away with it in case they really, really did their due diligence and were unable to be aware of any wrongdoing, but that&#x27;s going to be hard to prove.<p>For example, if a publisher decides to make money using some shady ad network, and that ad network distributes malware / violates privacy rules / whatever, the publisher is the one that&#x27;s going to hang for it, not the ad network. This will mean that publishers are naturally incentived to get really good guarantees that the ad network (or, more relevant to this point, the hosting company) isn&#x27;t violating any laws.

Surprised people downvoted this.<p>There are rumors that a joint statement will be released at 5PM Pacific Time...<p><i>Joint Statement Regarding CoinBase<p>Apr 1st, 2014<p>The purpose of this document is to summarize a joint statement to the Bitcoin community regarding CoinBase.<p>This tragic violation of the trust of users of CoinBase was the result of one company’s actions and does not reflect the resilience or value of bitcoin and the digital currency industry. There are hundreds of trustworthy and responsible companies involved in bitcoin. These companies will continue to build the future of money by making bitcoin more secure and easy to use for consumers and merchants.  As with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we are seeing today.  CoinBase has confirmed its issues in private discussions with other members of the bitcoin community<p>We are confident, however, that strong Bitcoin companies, led by highly competent teams and backed by credible investors, will continue to thrive, and to fulfill the promise that bitcoin offers as the future of payment in the Internet age.<p>In order to re-establish the trust squandered by the failings of CoinBase, responsible bitcoin exchanges are working together and are committed to the future of bitcoin and the security of all customer funds. As part of the effort to re-assure customers, the following services will be coordinating efforts over the coming days to publicly reassure customers and the general public that all funds continue to be held in a safe and secure manner: Kraken, BitStamp, Circle, and BTC China.<p>We strongly believe in transparent, thoughtful, and comprehensive consumer protection measures. We pledge to lead the way.<p>Bitcoin operators, whether they be exchanges, wallet services or payment providers, play a critical custodial role over the bitcoin they hold as assets for their customers.  Acting as a custodian should require a high-bar, including appropriate security safeguards that are independently audited and tested on a regular basis, adequate balance sheets and reserves as commercial entities, transparent and accountable customer disclosures, and clear policies to not use customer assets for proprietary trading or for margin loans in leveraged trading.<p>The following industry leaders stand by this statement:<p>Jesse Powell — CEO of Kraken<p>Nejc Kodrič — CEO of Bitstamp.net<p>Bobby Lee — CEO of BTC China<p>Nicolas Cary — CEO of Blockchain.info<p>Jeremy Allaire — CEO of Circle\n</i><p>p.s.

They ignored the initial reports and marked the bug as won&#x27;t fix.<p>Someone used this vulnerability to pull a bunch of example addresses and their response is &quot;so what, nothing&#x27;s wrong, probably wasn&#x27;t us&quot;.<p>But these are three serious issues.<p>1) Why should anyone be able to figure this out without being a registered application? This is especially true given #3. And the lack of rate limiting is just irresponsible.<p>2) Why should anyone be able to ask Coinbase what my name is? Even if they allowed that, why can you do it without being a registered user of their API? Again, the lack of rate limiting is also irresponsible.<p>3) I understand it&#x27;s purposeful that they&#x27;ll treat anyone as having an account for the purposes of on boarding, that make sense. But the ability to send emails to anyone on the internet without risking my reputation is asking for trouble. Again, this should be heavily rate limited unless you&#x27;ve registered with them. Anyone can sign up for an Amazon SES account, but you have to go through a few hoops before you can start sending out 500 messages a second.<p>These statements read like Baghdad Bob to me. We don&#x27;t agree, nothing is wrong, go about your business as if nothing had happened.<p>If their initial response was &quot;that&#x27;s all correct, we&#x27;re looking into rate limiting and maybe requiring you to register to make API calls&quot; that would have been the end of it.<p>If I want to send money to someone, I should call Coinbase and they should send the request. The response to me should be &quot;sent&quot; or &quot;error&quot;. Imagine if whenever I paid a bill with my credit card the return was not just &quot;success&quot; or &quot;failure&quot; but &quot;success&quot;, &quot;current balance&quot;, and &quot;mother&#x27;s maiden name&quot;.

If variance of a distribution is finite then the central limit theorem applies, and given a sufficient number of trials, the distribution will begin to approach a normal distribution. However some data sets have infinite variance and may (under some conditions) begin to approach a power law distribution; or, they have finite but extremely large variance, in which case the number of trials it will take to begin to look like a normal distribution is very, very large.<p>For your second point – there are legitimate uses for other summary statistics (mode, median), but they can still be very misleading. For example, you mention using the mode of the distribution as a predictor of what the next customer will pay – this definitely wouldn&#x27;t work for a company with a metered pricing plan, for example.

7511921,comment,7507280,7509477,5,0,patio11,,,"The universal understanding of salary numbers among employees in the United States is that it is gross cash pay before deductions.  We typically quote them annually for professional positions, and they&#x27;re typically paid out in approximately equal bi-weekly installments, with a bit of variation for cash bonuses (which are common in some industries/locales and not in others).<p>The biweekly paycheck for someone with a $100k salary would thus be approximately $4,000 gross.  It would list a deduction for payroll taxes, a deduction for anticipated federal and state income tax, a deduction for the employee&#x27;s portion of health insurance, and perhaps some miscellaneous deductions for unemployment insurance premiums, automatic contribution to their retirement account, and what have you.  This leaves them with net pay (probably in the $2,700 region or so but it&#x27;s heavily sensitive to their family situation because that makes a huge difference in how much anticipated income tax is withheld) which is actually transferred to their account.<p>So all of that is included &quot;within&quot; the $100k yearly salary.  What isn&#x27;t, such that business owners have to model it separately?<p>1)  Payroll taxes are typically divided half between employees and half between employers.  For example, there&#x27;s a ~14% levy on the first ~$100k in salary, for Social Security (primarily a form of compulsory retirement savings which the vast majority of working Americans are legally required to contribute to).  ~7% is deducted from each paycheck for this (so ~$280 out of $4,000).  An equivalent sum is contributed by the employer, without ever appearing on a paycheck.  So the employee&#x27;s <i>real</i> salary is actually about $107,000 but $7,000 disappears to taxes prior to the point where they&#x27;re told the salary that they are going to be taxed on.<p>2)  For historical reasons, the United States does not tax many forms of health insurance if provided as a perk to employees.  The United States also historically did not have a national health insurance scheme.  (We&#x27;ve got Obamacare these days but it doesn&#x27;t meaningfully interact with the math for Valley engineers.)  The combination of these two facts means that virtually all white collar employees expect to have employers fund fairly generous health insurance plans as an employment perk.  The pricing for these gets a little weird, but you&#x27;re in the right ballpark at about $10k to $20k per employee per year.<p>3)  In addition to our national retirement savings program, we have &quot;individual&quot; retirement savings.  These programs have substantial tax advantages.  These are not compulsory, and can be funded by either an employee, an employer, or both.  It is the common practice of most employers of engineers to fund these retirement accounts on a matching basis.  The offer is at the company&#x27;s discretion (up to a legal cap).  A common offer is &quot;We will match $2 of your contributions with $1 of our own money, up to a maximum match of 3% of your salary.&quot;<p>4)  American engineers are commonly offered perks.  Many are comparatively inexpensive when bought at company size -- free gym memberships for all employees, for example.  Some are not exactly inexpensive -- free lunches and dinners on the company&#x27;s premises daily, prepared by gourmet chefs, for example.  Americans do not customarily include the implicit cost of perks in salary figures.<p>5)  There&#x27;s a bunch of business overhead that I haven&#x27;t accounted for above (desks, prorated rent, computers, etc), but they&#x27;re substantially the same as in Israel, so I won&#x27;t belabor the point.<p>Anyhow: health care, taxes, and perks is what gets you to 50 to 100%.",1396388427

The client is _not_ the party canceling the connection; it&#x27;s failing to send a necessary signature verification message to the server during handshaking, which causes well-behaved _servers_ to send a fatal alert to the _client_.  On the SecureTransport side, the library then downgrades the SSL version and tries to connect again.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not suggesting the root bug is &quot;implement ECC&quot;; the root bug is the fact that NSURLCredential and/or NSURLConnection accept identities with invalid keys.

It gives an explanation on why this is even an intelligent question to answer and why the answer we commonly accept is that gravity moves at the speed of light. I will never have better words than him so I won&#x27;t add anything to what he said.<p>What I would like to point out, is that this essay is not talking about whether or not theoretically would be possible to have a speed of gravity faster than the speed of light. General relativity and special relativity have been tested on several aspects, and they pretty much are in agreement with all experimental constraint. There is no other theory that can explain everything we see (some theories tend to explain a few things, but not all of them, or they are too vague).<p>A theory in which the speed of gravity is faster than the speed of light isn&#x27;t unconceivable per se, but no one has been able to write a completely consistent one yet, mostly because it would have large consequences on what special and general relativity imply for cosmology and particle physics (and causality). If gravity moved faster than the speed of light then we&#x27;d have to &#x27;fix&#x27; a lot of problems coming down to paradoxes and stuff like that.<p>So take this essay as a way to appreciate how elegant and fine some experimental questions on gravity (and physics) are.",1396387231

My only real worry is that he will not be proactive about <i>improving</i> conditions or about supporting relevant community initiatives, but the same could be said of a CEO that has no opinion whatsoever on gay marriage.<p>In any case, OKCupid has taken public actions (e.g. their message to Firefox users) that indicate that, as a company, they come down in favor of gay marriage. The individual beliefs and actions of their rank & file employees should not matter in the slightest.",1396387020

If you then invested that at 5% until you reached retirement age, you could have earned right around $1,000,000 over your career above your regular income going forward. As such, your ROI should really be calculated on what you are able to earn in your career above that.<p>As you said, the actual cost depends on a lot of variables.  However, that is an unrealistic starting point, at least for the period 1998 - 2002 when I was an undergrad.  As a trade apprentice, which is probably the best job I could get with only high school, I would be looking at about $20,000/year, or $80,000.  Plus, your starting point neglects living costs and taxes, which are going to consume a significant portion of that amount and which my scholarships covered.  It further neglects working during school; I made $3,000/year - $5,000/year doing landscaping, maintenance, tutoring, and other odd jobs.  That amount is about what a part-time (20 hours/week), minimum wage job would pay at that time.  That cuts the opportunity cost down to $20,000 - $40,000 for the entire period, which is not much of a head start on a career that is going to pay me more than that in my first year after graduation.",1396386852

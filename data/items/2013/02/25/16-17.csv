I have made no such claim, and I have, in fact not even touched upon such arguments.<p>My whole argument is based around the fact that you are trying to equate things that are in fact very distinctly different. The whole point is that the history of Weimar Germany is everything <i>but</i> an internal fight, unlike both historical events you mentioned.<p>The German Left and the German Right leading up to 1933 are very distinct groups, with specific affiliated cultures, outlets, forerunners etc. Equating the events leading up to fascist rule in Germany with the in-group fighting you mention is a) misleading and b) void of any historical precedent. The two distinct blocs have <i>never</i> been a coherent group that then splits into two factions. They have never been united and have always been very easy to tell apart. Bismarck's Sozialistengesetze are just one of the many examples of the clear and effective divide between the Left and the Right, both in the Kaiserreich and subsequently during the Weimar Republic.<p>I know you are trying to make an overly generalised point equating left and right, however, this does not make your view any more substantiated. Historical evidence, recent (and not-so-recent) scholarship, as well as cultural history suggest that the equation you make is a crass reduction -- and thus oversimplification -- of the actual, very complex historical process for the sake of the popular argument that left and right are <i>the same</i>, and that any conflict between them is an <i>internal</i> conflict.",1361811292

It's not for everyone, and yes, some people don't get an ROI on what they do. But that's not social media's fault -- that is the advertiser's.<p>My wife works in online marketing for women's retail. Every time they spend a dollar on Facebook or Twitter, they make two, or sometimes four, or more. An ad click or promoted post results in a measurable real sale.<p>Social media advertising is not that different from the kind of Google Adsense ads you see on blogs, at the end of the day. Sure, they convert less than Adwords and are less profitable since there's less intent, but these things are still a quantum leap beyond what was possible before the Internet.<p>New channels spring up and they turn out to be valuable and help businesses make a lot of money and build real brands. My wife worked at Modcloth and now at Bebe. Modcloth is probably going to go public in the next few years, and all with an online-only, email and social media-based marketing machine. They're a profitable real business built on a new channel.<p>Bebe was started in 1976 and also piggybacked on a new form of advertising medium that was unexploited. In 1976, it was bus terminals and bus shelter ads - they were cheaper than any other method (magazine, etc) and got their brand everywhere.

I can not recommend it highly enough for actually understanding Haskell. I will try to answer your queries, but I think you may understand it better if you just flick through the chapter on Higher Order Functions.<p>> Would be great if you offered an example where the argument and return type differed. As is, I don't know which order the Haskell declaration uses.<p>In Haskell, the last (rightmost) type is the return type. eg. countLetters :: String -> Int means it takes an argument of type String and returns an argument of type Int. Also, types are chained together so for example, foobar :: String -> Int -> Bool is a function that takes two arguments, the first being a String, the second an Int and it returns a Bool and foobarbaz :: String -> Int -> Bool -> Char is a function that takes three arguments, the first a String, the second an Int, the third a Bool and it returns a Char. This syntax makes a lot of sense when exploiting ""higher-order functions"" and ""currying"". I mention this only to provide keywords for your personal search.<p>> If this is essential at this point, it should be fleshed out more. Otherwise it feels like a distracting aside and out of place in a short introduction.<p>In my view this is an aside.<p>> Not clear why the left side is (.). Is this because it's non-alpha? Because it's infix? Something else? Order to read right hand side still unclear. Also don't know if reuse of a, b, and c as variables is significant.<p>To write a function whose name starts with a punctuation character, Haskell syntax demands that it is wrapped by brackets and I think its automatically infix. You can use any function infix by wrapping it in ` eg. x `f` y is the same as f x y which means (f x) y which means apply the function f to the argument x, and then to the argument y.<p>'a', 'b' and 'c' are type variables, similar to type variables in Java and C# when dealing with generics. They can stand for any type. So, 'a' could be String or Char or Bool or any other type. As could 'b' and 'c'. So 'a' may or may not be the same type as 'b' or 'c'.<p>I'm not sure I can make it any clearer but note the signature of (.) has two arguments and a single return type. The first argument is (b -> c) which means it is a function that takes a single argument 'b' and returns a value of type 'c'. So the first argument of (.) is a function. The second argument is (a -> b) which is also a function. Its return type is also a function.<p>Personally I think (.) is a very hard function to grok and certainly far too complex for the first higher order function you see, exponentially so if you're still trying to understand Haskell syntax.<p>> Would help to define a ""cons cell"". Is Cons a data type or a function here? Is there a standard for capitalization? Not clear to me how the 'a' on the left side relates to the two on the right. Is 'data' a keyword, a type, or something else?<p>data is a keyword. Its how you define a data structure in Haskell. In this case, its defining a data structure called List which will wrap elements of type 'a'. In other words, 'List Int' is a type, 'List Bool' is a type, 'List Char' is a type. List is broadly the same as generic in Java or C# where List<String> is a type and List<Bool> is a different type. Cons is a data constructor (and yes, its standard to capitalise data contructors), which you can think of as being a function Cons :: a -> List a -> List a. It takes two arguments, an 'a' and a 'List a' and returns a 'List a'. Here the type variable 'a' does something as Haskell ensures that if the first argument is an Int, then the second must be a List Int and will return a List Int. If the first argument is a String however, then the second must be a List String and will return a List String.<p>> I think a gloss of what 'e' actually means would help<p>e means ""create an anonymous function that takes an argument called e with any type"". And (e -> e + 1) is an anonymous function that adds one to every element passed to it.<p>Seriously, check out Learn You a Haskell.",1361810688

Garrett is a core guy, and Linus knows him well and respects his work.  He chose that language to make a broader point, not merely to ""explode"".  This isn't about emotions, it's about content.<p>Which is sort of the point here: the ""shim signed by Microsoft"" trick isn't the ""Wrong Thing"", really.  The hardware companies absolutely need a top-level cert authority if secure boot is going to have any utility at all, and Microsoft is the only entity that has stepped up to the plate.  What else are we going to do?  Dell and Lenovo and Acer aren't about to add a key to their database (and test it) just because the Linux Foundation asked nicely.  They're shipping windows hardware. That's not going to happen.  So the Shim idea is as good as we're going to get, and as Red Hat (and SUSE, and Canonical) has to ship a product that runs on real hardware, it's the choice they had to make.<p>That said, I think there's a strong argument that baking this authority into the kernel is a bad idea.  Linus clearly agrees (and frankly mjg probably does too, but you can't just write a feature and not try to upstream it).  And he's made that point as forcefully and publicly as he can.",1361810539

Sugar and other high glycemic index foods (eg white bread) causes an insulin spike and puts your body into an anabolic, ""building"" state in which it will assimilate whatever it has lying around. Usually, if you're eating something with high amounts of sugar, it will also have high amounts of fat (ice cream, cookies, etc). Thus you will have a large amount of fatty acids lying around which your body will go ahead and form into droplets to be stored in adipose tissue. That's how you build fat.<p>However, if you are in a state of muscular stress, such as after weight lifting, and you eat a ton of glucose - notice I said glucose, not sugar, which contains fructose - and you combine this with a moderate amount of protein and little to no fat, you'll have a bunch of amino acids floating around and this insulin spike will cause your muscles to soak up all that protein and become bigger/stronger/both depending on the type of weightlifting you did with no spillover into adipose fat tissue.<p>It's this very simple metabolic process that people don't get. Everyone gets all worked up on pointing the finger at fat or sugar or whatever, but this is the ""secret"".<p>Btw, for anyone looking to lose weight or put on muscle in a healthy way, check out intermittent fasting, specifically the leangains plan.<p>Source: I'm a biochem major with a six pack",1361809461

He knows what's right, and he's dressing down people who also knew what was right but did the wrong thing anyway.   People act as if Jobs was a tyrant badmouthing random innocent people. He wasn't. He was actually pretty genial most of the time. What would set him off was not when someone made an error, but when someone did the wrong thing and they knew it was wrong at the time, but did it anyway.<p>Jobs was the keeper of the flame of ""do the right thing"" (my phrase for it) which always involved the right thing for the customer (which is why Apple doesn't follow trends, and rather than make netbooks made the iPad, a superior customer experience.)<p>Linus is doing the same thing here.  For Torvalds the customer is a different customer, both linux users but a lot of developers and the open source community at large.  But he's keeping the flame as he sees it, and history indicates he's pretty accurate.<p>As to another commentators wondering if this would happened if the submitter was female, it really shouldn't matter.  I'd like to think that Linus reacted to the error, not the person.  It's true that taking it down a notch or two and being more diplomatic is appropriate, almost all the time. It's clear that Torvalds is this way almost all the time, which is why he has such a lovable teddy-bear image, for the most part.  The power of blowing up on someone is not when you're doing it, but in the knowledge that there is shit up with you will not put.  That's the power.<p>Also, there's nothing really that gender specific in what he said.  Both men and women could engage in hypothetical ""dick sucking contests"".<p>Frankly, the average female engineer I've known is tougher than the average male engineer I've known (who tend to be a bit on the wimpy side, while the women tend to be a bit less wimpy than average for people.)  But that's just my experience, and consequently anecdotal.  The point being that I don't really believe that female engineers are desperate for people to protect them, and that most of the ""software development is <i>So Sexist</i>!"" people are non-engineers looking for an excuse to be outraged.  Some evidence: all the hate towards ""brogrammer"" stuff, which it is painfully obvious to everyone inside the industry is an inside joke lampooning male programmers by contrasting those pasty nerds with the tanned jock stereotype that beat them up in high school.  To act like ""brogrammers"" are perpetuating a male sexist culture is to, in the most profound way possible, not get the joke!<p>However, there is sexism... and the reaction from the sexists would be <i>much</i> different if he had been addressing a female.  But that's not sexism on Linus's part- in this hypothetical he was saying the same thing in both cases.  But if he'd said it to a female, the knee jerk sexists who want to see sexism everywhere (except in themselves) would have reacted quite differently.",1361809234

But Tarn makes a living off of DF despite that, because he's trying to procedurally generate interesting stories. That's a really big challenge, and it's something very, very few other games try and do. If you check out his devlog (<a href=""http://bay12games.com/dwarves/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bay12games.com/dwarves/index.html</a>) and his planned feature list (<a href=""http://bay12games.com/dwarves/dev.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bay12games.com/dwarves/dev.html</a>) you can see the scope is... staggering in complexity.

As people noted below, UI is not really Tarn's focus and probably won't be any time soon. The code is not open and Tarn is pretty straightforward about not wanting to share it with anyone, because he doesn't want to introduce more complexity with non-canonical versions and churn as he continues to replace older subsystems with new ones (At least, this is my recollection of the topic, but I've been out of the loop for a while). So no, it's not going to get fixed any time soon.<p>Regardless, I really love this game. But I think the wiki's quick-start guide is not sufficient to get up and running with the game.

I don't really have a face and as far as the company is concerned I exist as my deliverables... so they better be up to par. The other reason is that working this way requires projects to be organized ON PAPER. Those who have worked at any corporation will understand why that is important. So many managers bullshit their way around doing things like clearly documenting requirements or tracking deliverables. This simply won't work in a telecommute environment.<p>I really do believe that if I were to hire a team to complete a project I'd do so on a telecommute basis. It's simply cheaper and faster if done correctly and thus gives any company that does so an advantage.<p>One last point: I don't believe any manager who is not him/herself an engineer is suited to manage such a team.",1361809135

Simply, it works for me.<p>The general ""vibe"" I get from this is that that new management has arrived and is concerned about productivity. I assume that if new management has arrived, they would or should know what productivity levels should be and that yahoo remote staff are lacking. If so, then from a management POV, it does seem quickest and simplest to notionally get everyone back to base and kind of hit a reset switch.<p>If yahoo is now a low ranked place to work, then I can well imagine that in general its employees are a bit low ranked too, and perhaps some of the more lazy ones looking for a lax easy life. Presumably the quality people will have left. In which case, remote working cant work well at all.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not blaming the employees, this can only happen or go wrong if management lets it.  But, I think one should support a new regime that is presumably trying to sort it out. Presumably, and if it were me, they will assess the situation and bit by bit allow people out of the office again, but with new procedures, guidelines or what ever.<p>So, to be honest, I think I can see what yahoo is doing.

The Haskell equivalent is merely a type restriction.  Here it says ""dear compiler, whatever you may think about that 'foo' thing, I'm telling you this is a function from integers to floating points.<p>Oh, and type names are capitalized in Haskell. ""list"" was a typo.<p>Now,<p><pre><code>  (.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)\n</code></pre>\nreads in a similar way.  On the left side of '::', we have an identifier (which here happens to be an infix operator, hence the surrounding parentheses).  On the right side of '::', we have the type we wish to declare (which here is a bit complicated).<p><pre><code>  g . f = x -> g (f x)\n</code></pre>\nI'm just defining a new value here.  The left side of '=' tells us we define the dot operator (which is a function with two arguments), and the right hand side is just the body of the function.<p><pre><code>  x -> blah_blah\n</code></pre>\nis a functional value. '' and '->' are the syntax constructs. 'x' is the parameter, and 'blah_blah is the body.  This code reads ""the function which produces 'blah_blah' from 'x'"".

So,<p><pre><code>  foo :: a -> b -> c\n</code></pre>\nis the same as<p><pre><code>  foo :: a -> (b -> c)\n</code></pre>\nYou can think of it as a functions with two arguments, or as a function with one arguments, which returns a function with the remaining argument.<p><pre><code>  map (a -> b) -> List a -> list b\n</code></pre>\nLacks the '::' because I forgot to write it.

5279586,comment,5278133,5278822,1,0,DrDreams,,,"Speaking as an embedded developer, I see a number of other embedded devs hobbying around with FPGAs.  However, I very rarely see convincing use cases for FGPAs.  This article seems to lean toward the belief many of my colleagues have, that FPGAs are right around the corner in terms of general usefulness.  However, I disagree strongly.  I find that they are highly-specialized devices.<p>Before reading the rest of my writing, consider that at this time, brilliant hardware designers are putting similar amounts of work into both general purpose CPUs and into FPGAs.  However, CPUS are comprised of dense blocks of special-purpose silicon for common purposes, such as floating-point math.  FPGAs always have to match that dense silicon through configurable silicon, which is less dense.  Furthermore, the routing in CPUs is a known entity at manufacturing time.  On FPGAs, the routing is highly variable and must be re-negotiated at nearly every compile cycle.  That's a huge time sink, both in terms of build time and in predicting performance.  Especially since those short routes that you get at the beginning of a project, typically end up being longer by the end of it.  Nowadays, we are seeing more FPGAs with dedicated, pre-made hardware blocks inside of them, such as FPUs and even CPU cores.  These have more of a chance of catching on for general purpose computing.  Notice however, that on these devices, it's the general-purpose CPU dominating, leaving the FPGA as a configurable peripheral, subordinate to the dense, pre-designed silicon.<p>Although one may be able to match GPU performance with an FPGA, it's usually just not worth it.  It will take dozens of hours of FPGA coding and simulation.  Compiling and fitting and the rest of the FPGA dev chain is very time-consuming and resource-intensive, compared to the speed and elegance of gcc.  Speaking of standard development practices, FPGA code is not nearly as portable as C.  It often has special optimizations done for the sake of the device implemented.  <a href=""http://opencores.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opencores.org</a> has a number of more generic modules available, but still, FPGA code does not scale as well as C code.  There are add-on packages that help write FPGA synthesis code - code synthesizers, but they make matters especially complicated.  The syntax of Verilog and VHDL is not well-designed for scaling.  Speaking of these languages, if you are used to languages written to be parsed easily, such as lisp, python, or even C and Java to some extent, you will be very appalled at the structure of Verilog and VHDL.  There are many redundant entities, lots of excess verbiage and all kinds of special cases.  It really has evolved very little since the days of the Programmed Array of Logic (PAL).<p>Another problem with FPGAs is the additional hardware on board needed to configure them.  It's one more component or interface that is not needed when using CPUs.  It's an additional software image to maintain, revision, store in source control, etc.  FPGAs also often require more power supplies and better power supply conditioning than a regular CPU and often a separate clock crystal.  They are high-maintenance.<p>FPGAs do shine though in a few specific instances:  1. When there is a particular, uncommon high-speed bus protocol you need to communicate with and can not buy pre-designed silicon for.  This does not mean, e.g. USB.  It means something like a non-standard digital camera interface or embedded graphic display.  2. Software Radio.  3. Obscure, but computationally-intensive algorithms like Bitcoin.<p>I hope my words have convinced some people to cool their lust for FPGAs, because I feel they're a bit of a dead-end or distraction for many who are attracted to the idea of ""executing their algorithm extremely fast"" or ""becoming a chip designer.""  I have seen many students and professionals burn up hours and hours of their time getting something to run on an FPGA which could just as easily have been CPU-based.  For example, one student implemented a large number of PWM oscillators on an FPGA where it would have been much simpler to use the debugged, verified, PWM peripherals on microcontrollers.  Another guy I work with is intent on running CPU cores on FPGAs.  This is an especially perverse use of the FPGA.  Unless you've got some subset of the CPU which adds incredible value to the process, you're exchanging the the density of the VLSI/ASIC version of the chip for the flexible, less dense version on FPGA.  This may be useful in rare situations, such as adding an out-of-order address generator to an existing core for speeding up an FFT, but it suffers an incredible performance and developer time hit to get to this point.",1361808375

It prices out patients paying out of pocket. The doctor realized that he himself gets about $700 from it. So the doctor reached out to another facility who agreed to do it for $1,800 instead of $6,000 for the exact same procedure. You can imagine how happy the doctor's patients are, particularly ones paying out of pocket.<p>Example 2: A patient got upset a doctor's office wanted him to pay copay. The patient got the bill and felt the doctor already got paid $1,500. When the office informed the patient that out of the $1,500 the doctor only got about $300, the patient was shocked.<p>Really what we need is a doctor compensation to everything else index. When we get that, we will realize the sham most of the efforts to reduce healthcare cost is. Most healthcare cost efforts focus on paying the doctor a little less, say $300 instead of $400. Problem is, bulk of the cost is not the doctor's fees. It is the cost of the bed, breakfast, Tylenol etc. We need regulation on those fees.",1361808373

In this case, that would take 1 clock tick - after which the probability that the output pattern represents XOR is almost 1 (there is a neglible chance of failure).<p>The point is: we cannot predict such circuits precisely enough when the output really is directly connected to the input (that would be a resonating feedback loop, after all - and we only know the input voltage to within some tolerance, not to mention quantummechanical effects), so there's always some gating and that means some intermediate storage.

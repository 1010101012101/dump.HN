Will write bad checks and do chargebacks on their credit card to get free PCs and free repairs. Then we get forced to cash only, and then they go to the Big Box stores that are open Sundays and take in store credit cards.<p>I got a lot of friends and family members running an old Pentium 4 with XP and some upgraded to Windows 7 somehow.  From time to time I fix their systems for free or a low cost.<p>PC Repair Shop had a deal, we&#x27;d install Linux for free but tech support was extra. A few took us up on the offer and had a good time using FOSS alternatives. We even set up Linux with SAMBA on Windows PC networks to share files and printers. But there was no money in it because 99% of the people and businesses wanted Windows.<p>Geeksquad refuses to support old Windows versions, so I get people with Windows 98 etc from time to time. You&#x27;d be amazed at the number of people out there still running old Windows and Office versions. Some even use old versions of Wordperfect. My wife volunteers and sometimes someone emails her a Wordperfect file and I use Libreoffice to open them.<p>I found in doing charity work, that a lot of charities still use old hardware and software that is no longer supported.

9828541,comment,9824884,9824884,0,0,nemanja,,,"This smells like a shill piece by a Google developer advocate [1] with a horse in the race [2].<p>The key benefit of React is an extremely low cognitive load.  There are only three simple concepts to grok (props, state and lifecycle) to get productive.  The code is very easy to reason about (components are essentially pure functions of props and state) and debugging is much simpler than with vanilla JS or jQuery on a project of any meaningful size.<p>With respect to performance, React shines when it comes to DOM mutations (e.g. removing a div from DOM, creating a new div, inserting new div into the DOM) which is what you generally encounter with the real-world load. Here is a demo illustrating such load [3]. Benchmark offered by OP is amazingly contrived (actually it feels designed to show React in a bad light and lack of full source code is very telling). I struggle to think of a real-world scenario of append-only page with 1000+ images in the DOM, there is simply no valid reason to do that. React in turn makes it really easy and fast to implement infinite scrolling (similar to UITableView) and there are a couple of good open source components that address that.<p>[1] See the bottom of <a href=""https://aerotwist.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://aerotwist.com/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://aerotwist.com/blog/polymer-for-the-performance-obsessed/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://aerotwist.com/blog/polymer-for-the-performance-obses...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OeXsL5mr4g"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OeXsL5mr4g</a>",1435967738

I sometimes get most creative when thinking about myself as the customer, particularly because I personally do not like buying things.<p>It takes time to generate attention on social media without controversy or craziness.  Hang in there.<p>You have a great logo (hooray for spaceships!).  Your website is also clean (not too overwhelming) and easy to navigate.  I would recommend first selecting a few small businesses that you would like to have as clients. Can they understand your website - your message? I ask this because there are some areas where the wording can be rephrased. Especially with small businesses, you won&#x27;t just be selling to technical people, but you will be selling to busy people.<p>Examples are powerful. These don&#x27;t needed to be displayed publicly, but have something ready (and interesting!) to show potential clients what you can do. I don&#x27;t see a problem with your two interests: security and usability auditing.

You want to make it as easy as possible for people to find you online; it doesn&#x27;t take much for a website to get lost.<p>Ultimately, to get your first clients, I&#x27;d recommend treating each one with a lot of personal attention, and showing them that you truly care about them and their businesses. When you initiate contact with them (try to get a meeting, invite them to lunch or coffee, offer a contest, etc.), present your services as accessible, valuable, and profitable - a direct way to help their bottom line (with metrics to back you up). Even without client history, you can do this by doing old-school research and by being as prepared as possible for misinterpretations and specific concerns. Good luck!",1435967374

The other two theories mentioned by the article (anti-relocation, anti-commercialization) aren&#x27;t consistent with such an abrupt and poorly handled firing.<p>Now why would Reddit fire Victoria over the AMA?  There are many _possible_ reasons.  Here are some speculations.<p>One, no company wants to be the target of Reverend Jackson or his supporters complaining that they treated him in a disrespectful or racist fashion.  Look at how some of the various tech diversity controversies have played out, and how quickly.  Reddit may well have worried that _not_ firing Victoria could have put them in a &quot;Reddit is racist&quot; cross-hairs that could quickly have spun out of control.  Especially given how much of exactly that sort of material is floating around on various subreddits.  Given how those controversies can roll, reasoning like this may even have been in some sense correct.  Lose the whole company in a Twitter storm?  Or fire a popular employee and irritate a bunch of mods?<p>Two, CEO Pao is on record talking about the importance of diversity at Reddit.  It may very well be that she felt the AMA was cross-wise her own values, and those she wants to promote at Reddit.<p>Three, CEO Pao may also regard the Reverend and his supporters as important allies for purposes of her own, apart from her role as Reddit&#x27;s CEO.  She&#x27;s certainly out there as interested in diversity issues, and admired by many for that.  It isn&#x27;t hard to imagine that she would be concerned about that image.<p>Four, others at Reddit may have felt the AMA didn&#x27;t represent their values.  Silicon Valley is notoriously progressive, and when dealing with political questions people often don&#x27;t think straight.  The conflict between &quot;AMAs can be rough&quot; and &quot;Reverend Jackson deserves more respect than that&quot; creates cognitive dissonance.  That makes decision-making very hard.  Add in some pressure from Jackson or his people -- whom many in Silicon Valley _want_ to perceive as reasonable and intelligent folks, and exposed to a lot of unreasonable criticism -- and good choices start to get difficult.<p>We don&#x27;t _know_ anything, of course.  The basic point is, the Jackson AMA created a _political_ situation for Reddit.  Political decision-making is already hard, and the thinking about it easily confused.  Reddit may have made a political choice driven by business concerns.  Or it may have made political choices based on its employees personal agendas or outlooks.<p>Or, the timing of the firing and the AMA were completely coincidental.",1435967267

How exactly was freedom of the press attacked?  Did the US or German governments stop Der Spiegel from publishing something?  Were they blackmailed into suppressing a story (but for some reason not so for this one)?  As far as the story indicates, the only action that was taken was to move the person accused of leaking from one department to another.  But, hey, &quot;An Attack on Press Freedom&quot; gets more people to view those 9 ad banners scattered throughout the article...<p>2) I just read this article twice over, and I can&#x27;t actually see any evidence that US intelligence services were targeting Der Spiegel.  Somehow the CIA station chief finds out that someone in the German Department Six is passing information to Der Spiegel, and informs the head of Department Six.  They don&#x27;t actually give any indication as to how the CIA got that information, but just state that it was most likely the NSA spying on Der Spiegel as if it were a foregone conclusion.  How do they know this?  I can think of a number of other situations where the CIA may have received this information...<p><pre><code>  - The CIA had a source inside Der Spiegel
  - The CIA was spying on their source (not Der Spiegel)
  - The NSA was spying on their source
  - The CIA/NSA was spying on a third party that knew of the leaks
  - The source was drunk at a bar and bragged about it to or within earshot of a CIA agent
  - One of the journalists was drunk at a bar and bragged about it.
  - The CIA/NSA was spying on Russian intelligence (or any other country in the region) and that foreign intelligence service was doing any of the above
  - etc. ...
</code></pre>
I accept that they don&#x27;t want to reveal their source, but there&#x27;s no mention of an anonymous source, or documents acquired by Der Spiegel, or anything else substantiate the US targeting the news outlet.  As far as I can tell, this is the extent of their attribution:<p><i>Research conducted by SPIEGEL has determined the existence of CIA and NSA files filled with a large number of memos pertaining to the work of the German newsmagazine.</i><p>Really? That&#x27;s it? They somehow know that documents exist which somehow make reference to a global news outlet known for breaking headlines concerning the work of these intelligence agencies?  What kind of research was conducted, and what do these documents actually say?  For god&#x27;s sake - Der Spiegel is one of the few news agencies that has the whole Snowden trove and regularly releases documents from it, but they can&#x27;t show anything from there proving their claim?<p>Not too long ago, the Sunday Times in England ran a story claiming that documents stolen by Edward Snowden were in the hands of Chinese and Russian intelligence services, relying solely on anonymous sources in the British government.  They were rightly lambasted for it in a number of other media outlets.  Der Spiegel is now doing almost the exact same thing.",1435966878

However, many programmers assume that if the source string points to a higher memory location than the destination string, then it is ok (i.e., they want to shift a string of X bytes to the left by some amount).  And they&#x27;ve gotten away with it for many years, because most strcpy() functions are implemented very simply (they copy one byte at a time).  The problem is when 15 year old code is run on a newer platform that has an SSE4 optimized implementation of strcpy -- then they find out what is meant by &quot;undefined behavior&quot;.",1435966753

If you support multiple OSes, they are all very different at the very bottom level and sometimes socket states and their transitions are just plainly weird (and undocumented).

Transaction processing is also yummy, 2PC obviously can&#x27;t be recovered in all possible failure cases, 3PC is sensitive to network partitioning, checkpointing might run into local storage problem etc. We had our own distributed testing suite as well as standard conformance tests, yet these were badly insufficient and were more like firing off a shotgun and hoping it would help.",1435966391

Whose votes do I trust?<p>Distributing reddit is a hard problem, but making it anonymous is even harder. It&#x27;ll be easier to start with cryptographic identities and add anonymity later. In the meantime, users can generate new identities for every action. They will be ignored by other users, since reputation is the easiest way to separate signal from noise.<p>Building this system will be much easier if you investigate the toolkits for building distributed systems that have been built since Aether started. Ethereum has three building blocks for distributed systems: a blockchain for storing data that requires consensus, like the identities of the creators and moderators of a community; Whisper, a messaging system for sending data that doesn&#x27;t require consensus, like broadcasting the existence of a sub-forum; and Swarm, a distributed data store for things like discussion archives and the HTML, CSS and Javascript that such a discussion system could be built from to run on every device that every user owns. (For an example of an application with this sort of architecture, see Augur. <a href=""http://augur.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://augur.net</a>)<p>Besides the development speed gained from using these tools, your system will gain benevolent forkability. You want developers with ideas about decentralized communities to write forks that effectively don&#x27;t steal users since everyone&#x27;s using the same data sources to read from and write to. But using a homegrown distributed system makes that less likely. If it were built on Ethereum&#x27;s toolkit, even if a developer disagrees with most of what you&#x27;ve done, it&#x27;s in their interest to use the same data source even if they rewrite everything. The userbase of benevolently forkable distributed systems never needs to be split, which is a powerful characteristic for growth.<p>Aether is fantastic, and it&#x27;s where the web is heading.

I humbly disagree, I&#x27;ve definitely seen a few startups get nowhere because they ended up open sourcing their entire product, meaning nobody needed to pay them for anything.<p>There needs to be a strategy for open sourcing your code...for example if dropbox open sourced their client, they&#x27;d still own the relationship to their storage back-end and act as the broker for that data. Their client isn&#x27;t really worth anything anyways...so it doesn&#x27;t really matter.<p>But let&#x27;s say Microsoft open sourced Office and Windows. Okay, now where do they make their money? They&#x27;re pretty much just left with services work, and services and support often only exist if the software has problems. Anybody else can then come along and code away their services business by fixing bugs, making better interfaces etc.<p>Open sourcing needs to have a valid business strategy and it can&#x27;t just be putting your company&#x27;s investment up on github because that feels good.",1435965298

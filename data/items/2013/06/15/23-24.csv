I bet, OS X still uses them, not magic pixie dust, to work with hardware. So, if you use hardware except for pre-configured one (i.e. one having drivers pre-bundled with OS), you have to figure out what drivers are and where to get them (if they exist).",1371340359

5886706,comment,5886344,5886344,17,0,hooande,,,"This story needs some historical context. This is pointed out in the blog post, but the main reason for wiretapping King wasn&#x27;t his civil rights advocacy, but his communist leanings. This in no way excuses or apologizes for the dirty tricks used by the federal government against a non-violent protestor. But this should make sense to students of US history.<p>Communism was the absolute defining political issue of the 20th century in America. Today communism seems like a failed political ideology, a cute thing that hippies like along with pot and drum circles. But in the 50s and 60s communism was the most evil thing imaginable, like aids spreading terrorists who block cell phone signals. Hoover in particular had spent his entire life fighting communism and saw it as the greatest threat our country had ever faced. Many of our parents or grandparents had nuclear bomb drills in elementary school, ducking and covering under their desks to protect themselves from the communist threat. Growing up like that, you can imagine the fear and rabid hatred that people had for the ideology.<p>This isn&#x27;t a story of &quot;Evil US government subverts wiretapping power to go after peaceful protestor&quot;. This is a case of the government executing the will of the people at the time. Hindsight is 20/20 and looking back their actions seem evil, but in historical context the FBI was doing exactly what they were supposed to be doing: fighting communism with everything they had. It may sound silly to us, but back then that was the only fight that mattered. The FBI and the public didn&#x27;t see it as wiretapping a private citizen, but as a part of a decades long political struggle.<p>Recently on HN people have been acting like the government can dominate the world through wiretapping. As if the NSA can find out a few secrets and people will bow their heads and be silent. Government wiretapping found a true dirty secret involving MLK and threatened to reveal it if he didn&#x27;t change what he was saying. Did he stop? <i>No</i>. Did he slow down for a single second? <i>Fuck no</i>. True political reformers aren&#x27;t cowed by blackmail and intimidation. As long as we have leaders like Martin Luther King, democracy will live forever.",1371340227

5886589,comment,5885798,5885798,7,0,angusgr,,,"Rather than &quot;open sourced&quot; all I see is &quot;a bit open specced&quot;. Yes, the &quot;hacker guide&quot; has details of what chips are on the board, and how they are connected:\n<a href=""http://developer.sonymobile.com/services/open-smartwatch-project/smartwatch-hacker-guide/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.sonymobile.com/services/open-smartwatch-pro...</a>\n... and there&#x27;s a separate page with a guide to putting it in DFU mode to upload a firmware.<p>Which is cool, but the chip names could have been found by the people who&#x27;d already done teardowns and the pinouts could be found by buzzing one out (possibly sacrificially by removing chips.)<p>The chip datasheets they link were all all already publically available, the Cypress touch sensor one is even a link to alldatasheet.com(!)<p>Probably the biggest letdown is the Bluetooth/FM chip made by Sony, arguably the most useful and most complex device aside from the MCU. That link is to Sony&#x27;s marketing specs page with a block diagram and not much technical info that I can see. I can&#x27;t find any information about the chip made available to the public by Sony.<p>Ironically enough there is a longer 6 page Sony datasheet leaked on datasheet sites, but even this doesn&#x27;t have pinouts or begin to explain how the SPI interface to Bluetooth/FM functionality actually works.<p>I think it&#x27;s good that a major company like Sony released even this small amount of information, although it&#x27;s worth noting that reverse engineers have found more information on similar products acting entirely by themselves (take for instance the PS3 Move controller: <a href=""http://eissq.com/ps3_move/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eissq.com/ps3_move/</a> )<p>On the other hand I think it&#x27;s very bad that most people will glance at this and see Sony &quot;open sourcing&quot; something when they appear to be open sourcing nearly nothing. The RTOS they used is probably proprietary property of a third party so they can&#x27;t open source that, but they could release their application source code for the smartwatch - allowing people to see how they communicate with the Bluetooth/FM chip, for instance. That kind of source could be ported to an open source RTOS.<p>The optimist in me hopes that detailed technical information will be forthcoming over time, but the pessimist in me thinks this is the feel-good last gasp of an end-of-life product. :/",1371337277

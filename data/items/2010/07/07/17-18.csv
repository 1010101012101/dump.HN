1494862,comment,1494747,1494791,0,0,mahmud,,,"Let me add that language design != language implementation.<p>Try to prototype your language design in a very high-level language, preferably one with macros. So you can iron out the kinks rapidly without being bogged down by machine limitations. Also, try to use a homoiconic syntax for easy parsing, so you're not stressing over lexical analysis and other string manipulation crap.<p>Once you have the high-level semantics ironed out, you can choose a suitable intermediate representation, one that can handle several phases of optimization. Register or graph based IR, like SSA, will allow you to capture code and data flow, and it presents an underlying ""machine"" architecture with abundant resources (cheap infinite registers for starters.)<p>Stack-based IRs are compact and excellent for virtual interpretation, they also capture lexical scope and procedure call very well, but you will have to expend a bit more effort should you want to compile them for a native processor.<p>The easiest language to implement would probably be a block-structured Algol dialect (say, Oberon or Pascal) but without runtime heap allocation. That way you're not messing with garbage collection. You can allocate your application memory at startup or compile time and it will sit and stay in there. See Chapter 10 of this:<p><a href=""http://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/pascal/book/pascalimplementation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/pascal/book/pascalimplementa...</a><p>If you want first-class environments and closures you will need GC and a heap. You will also need a heap if you want first class objects or dynamic exception handling.<p>The language design stuff is boring, and you can be inspired by various designs out there. It's the runtime implementation that's funny, but very exciting.<p>Good luck.",1278525236

1494781,comment,1494277,1494684,0,0,barrkel,,,"The kitchen sink comes from the conflict between the C ideology C++ inherited, and the requirement for OO language features. RTTI and exceptions are fine when you can rely on them, but C++ users don't always want to pay for those features, so you end up with some libraries that require them, others that forbid them, and some in between which reinvented their own exceptions and RTTI mechanisms. Trying to glue all these disparate things together where there's so little accepted as being in common is a pain.<p>Languages built around platforms, like Java and C#, on the other hand, can assume that java.lang.Object / System.Object is the root of the inheritance hierarchy, that exceptions are used throughout for error handling, that reflection is available throughout (modulo security concerns), etc. The fact that you can rely on the base library, and that you can communicate between modules using containers / common interfaces in the box makes the job of integrating modules far easier.<p>C++ included some of these features, but didn't make them mandatory. So you end up with a strange mix across the board.<p>The other issue is that C++'s features aren't well thought out in an orthogonal sense. One example: the idea of exception safety doesn't mesh well with C++'s copy constructors, to the degree that you can't write a generic stack type whose pop method returns the value popped, because you can't get exception safety right on the mutation to the stack if the copy constructor on the returned value threw an exception.",1278523458

That's the opposite of countercyclical spending, which along with some welfare state components made up the new deal.  Maybe he was on board with the welfare state and the idea of people having high wages (who isn't?), but the government doesn't cut the majority of paychecks in the country, and those it does cut, he was, well, cutting.  In regards to the Depression,  he was pretty diametrically opposed to what the New Deal became.<p>You might have a book that says otherwise, but I've read several books that disagree with you.

Do you not feel that the expression of this desire will make you happier? Did you adopt your child? If not, then how is the creating of a human life in order for you to fulfill your desire to give what you have to offer to a child anything but selfish? Certainly there were kids that existed before that could have benefitted from your gifts. I don't mean to say you should not have had kids for this reason.

It seemed like the language was growing like a weed and was becoming totally unmanageable. The release of C# 3 basically led me to say ""what the hell, Microsoft?""<p>But one major counterpoint to all of this is the features added to C# 3 may seem like huge bloat at first, but when you realize they all exist to support LINQ, you end up seeing them as a pretty cohesive package. C# 3 was by far the biggest growth spurt the language has seen to date. Implicitly typed local variables, extension methods, lambdas, expression trees, etc, all exist solely to make LINQ possible. The fact that they are usable outside of LINQ is just an artifact. And honestly I think it's a good artifact, I feel all of these features have benefited the language. The more I use the new features (whether in the context of LINQ or not) the more I noticed my code becoming cleaner, more succinct and much easier to read.<p>C# 4 doesn't quite have the same major killer feature that 3 had to warrant its additions. But at the same time, most C# 4 features are meant for special cases (dynamic primarily makes COM interop much simpler, for example) and don't leak into day to day programming that much. Abusing these features is just a judgment call a programmer is going to have to make.<p>I do think MS treads a very fine line here. It would be easy for C# to fall over the edge and become ""the kitchen sink"", but as a very avid user, I honestly think they (so far) tread that line very carefully and quite well.

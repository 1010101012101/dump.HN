The spread between buy and sell rates is how traders make profits.  If there was no spread, or the spread was small, traders would need to take a proportion of the conversion as a fee.  Some banks and third parties do this - they offer a really wide spread, and then take a proportion over and above that.

However, I did not write that you as an onlooker would be 100% convinced that all of the things she claims were true. The article actually only names some accusations she makes, and I referred to these in my original question. Therefore, the things she posts may in parts be correct in my thought experiment, and the onlooker knows about that, while other parts of her posts may still be incorrect (""smear"").<p>Note that even with the actual article, i.e., without any knowledge about what actually happened other than what is written in the article, we are <i>all</i> ""random onlookers"". And we're all forming opinions one way or the other when we read something like this.<p>I am interested to know how these opinions would perhaps be influenced if we had additional knowledge that isn't explicitly mentioned in the article.

5667577,comment,5667466,5667466,22,0,corporalagumbo,,,"U-turn? I don't think so. A company like Microsoft doesn't change its logo and completely redevelop its <i>entire web presence</i> so that for the first time ever its entire product line-up is consistent unless it has really, really carefully thought through its plans, and is pretty damn committed to them. And, even if Windows 8 wasn't a rave success, it would be incredibly weak (not to mention idiotic) to cave to pressure from short-sighted consumers and pundits and return to the old desktop. Besides, I doubt anyone at Microsoft is that upset about Windows 8's reception - it was a truly foundational release, with so much work done in so many areas, and so obviously a work in progress, that even modest success was probably a good result.<p>Windows 8 was just the start of a massive transition process for Microsoft. Inevitably there were a lot of rough areas, room to improve, etc. Microsoft will have gained a huge amount of feedback, done a huge amount of work thinking about how to build on 8. I expect to continually up the polish, improve the features, smooth the split between both the new UI and the desktop, as well as improve the transition between different form factors, handle integration for users with multiple devices and so on better - but I don't see any significant reversal of direction. The old desktop is simply too antiquated and if Microsoft were to remain fused to it for any longer it would put them in an extremely dangerous position, given the quantum leaps in UI happening at the moment. The big question mark is how Microsoft is going to handle legacy app support while unifying the overall experience and setting sensible guidelines for what new apps (both Metro and Desktop) should look like. There is a lot of inertia in the Windows ecosystem and it will take a while to shift, but the results will definitely be worth it I think.",1367927249

5667503,comment,5660633,5664615,1,0,terhechte,,,"Yes, and no. I was referring to your criticism that people still use it. See, people do not use it because it is vim, the editor, but because it is vim, the text manipulation language. Really. There's nothing great about the editor itself, it is rather clunky, lacks solid UI abstractions, blocks the UI while it is busy doing something, has an awful scripting language (vim script), and more. If you take away the text manipulation language, nobody would use it.<p>Another point validating that is that people write vim-layers for all kinds of editors and IDEs. They don't port the editor (i.e. the weird UI blocking, or the text mode, or the other things or even vim script), they port the text manipulation language.<p>Coming back to what I originally said: You seem to not get vim, and how it allows to easily modify text with a manipulation language (not a programming language!). Say I'm at the beginning of a line:
#[exampleObject: obj displayTitle: @""this is the title""];
[delegateDoSomethingWith: @""this is the title""];
Say I want to take the 'this is the title', and change the contents to 'new title. In the vim-language, that's the following code (cursor pos is the #):
/@""<CR>2lci""new title<ESC>n2l.
or
Vj:s/this is the title/new title/<CR>
This is a simple example, but for moving around text and manipulating it (i.e. everything <i>after</i> you wrote the initial code / function class / whatever) it is beyond fantastic.<p>What's not so good, as outlined above, is vim the editor, simply because it is old and doesn't have a more modern UI, etc. There're many projects that tried to address this, but everyone, so far, failed to implement the text manipulation language as deeply as in the reference implementation vim.

Just holding off posting for a bit longer because I want to have a bit of a buffer (3-4 complete parts) before I get peoples hope of regular posts up again...<p>What is there uses vtable's exclusively - I effective punted on the slow path (and so on adding methods at runtime) completely, but keep track of how much of the vtable allocations is wasted space. If/when I get there, the goal is to use various mechanisms like this to determine when to fall back on a slow path, and couple both with polymorphic inline caching when suitable.<p>EDIT:<p>I don't see MRI as very interesting to work on, largely because interpreters aren't much fun, and ironically given the amount of time I spend using Ruby, I prefer compilers to be as static as possible. I also prefer my compilers to be bootstrapped in their target language. Hence my ""ideal"" Ruby compiler would be written in pure Ruby, do a ton of static analysis, with minimal fallback to JIT when users user features that are too dynamic to analyse fully ahead of time<p>E.g. there's a ton of annoying uses of eval() in Ruby code where a more complete meta-programming API would make it trivial for a compiler to do full ahead of time static analysis, so one big thing an AOT Ruby compiler really need to do is to provide a library of compiler specific meta-programming facilities with a fallback that uses eval() as needed, and either convince people to use it, or provide monkey-patches for a number of popular projects. Some of these uses don't even need eval() in the first places, but uses it just as a quick shortcut because it's simpler...<p>Just to make clear, I'm not sure when or even <i>if</i> my compiler project will ever get to a state where it's even remotely <i>useable</i> to compile Ruby. I started it out without even having decided to compiler Ruby, mostly to write about various parts of the process of writing a compiler that I find interesting.  I find compiling Ruby as incredibly fascinating from a theoretical point of view because of the complexity involved, but unfortunately working on it takes a lot more time and effort than thinking about the problems.",1367925482

Some even pride in doing so. The best case I've seen among these guys is paying some thing like paying 5% of the taxes they are supposed to pay.

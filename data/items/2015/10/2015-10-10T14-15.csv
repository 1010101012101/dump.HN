This is a country that is spying on economic allies all over the world and callaborates by horse trading secrets to corporate interests. I understand that they can&#x27;t talk about the length of the list, who is on it or the crimes they comitted, but just knowing they they have a list feels like justice to me, and these hackers will face retribution.<p>China has to realize that it is hurting the financial position of the entire country and it&#x27;s own credibility, by funneling secrets to private companies. If the reverse were true in the US, companies funneling secrets to the governement, it would be treason. America has the advantage of complete isolation of the government and corporations, which just isn&#x27;t possible in a communist nation, so only in the most <i>extreme</i> cases do the two share finances or data.<p>China approves state sanctioned hacking against their allies and citizens in private companies and it gives them an unfair advantage. If private companies had that sort of clout in the US, you would see laws structured favourably for corporations and they would yield a lot more political influence. China is the kind of country that would commit industrial espionage against private companies it is allied with economically and politically. If it were possible for them to configure Danish and Malaysian servers via network and physical intrusion, they would be able to tactically engineer a super virus that would affect >50% of a whole country, not to mention collatoral damage. It would hurt the companies reputation, jeopardize it&#x27;s secrets and causing them millions in damages as well as the hundreds of thousands affectd.<p>The article says:<p>&quot;Chinese prosecution would entail the United States sharing evidence linking the cyberintrusions to the individuals. And to do so could compromise sensitive information on how the U.S. government tracked the suspects.&quot;<p>THESE ARE HACKERS. We shouldn&#x27;t be afraid to get a win once in a while. We have to do something and a good first step would be to go to China, and tell them how we caught them breaking into private companies in the US and abroad, and we were able to document these records. They need to know that if they hit a multinational, a data center, resedential citizens, etc. that we are there, we will catch you and we will bring you to justice.<p>Im glad the US is taking a stand against this. I look forward to watching these hackers face trial, but ultimately, their government and citizens should be ashamed of themselves. It&#x27;s a shame the Cyber Security bill failed to pass the senate a few months ago, that way organizations would monitor for cyber threat indicators and they would be forced to protect us from these hackers.

10365537,comment,10361766,10361766,0,0,perlgeek,,,"Most of the software I write is based on business processes, which surely won&#x27;t even last 20 years (more likely 2 to 5 years), and/or technology (I work at an ISP and data center provider, so we manage stuff like IPs, VLANs, Hardware, Racks) which likely also won&#x27;t last 200 years.<p>The example from the article about accounting software is another good example: legal requirements change, which means that the software must also change; book keeping software from 30 years ago is utterly useless today, not because it wasn&#x27;t done well, but because too much changed.<p>Another example from the article: parking tickets. There were no parking tickets 100 years ago (80 years ago according to <a href=""http://theexpiredmeter.com/2009/08/first-parking-ticket-issued-in-1935/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theexpiredmeter.com/2009/08/first-parking-ticket-issu...</a>), and I doubt that however traffic looks in another 100 years, it will have not much in common with our current structure.<p>My takeaway is that we shouldn&#x27;t worry too much about longevity of the software; the more important aspect is the data formats. They should be open and well-documented, so that folks in the future have less trouble dealing with our data footprint. Maybe our data will still be of value in 200 years; at least some of it, and at least a bit. But I doubt our software will be, regardless of how we write it. I do agree with his points about the need for better review processes and oversight.<p>Update: Forgot one important point: Input method and user input devices change a lot. Who wants to use software today that assumed a max screen resolution of 600x400 or even lower? And no mouse, no touch screen, no audio or image or video input, even it would be highly desirable for the problem domain?",1444485688

It seems minor, but when you actually &quot;get&quot; vim, you&#x27;ll actually see speed improvements.  It sounds silly, the half second saved here and there, but once you&#x27;ve done it long enough, you get into a flow that you just can&#x27;t get moving your hands to the arrows or mouse.",1444485630
10365535,comment,10362855,10363820,0,0,ufo,,,"Yes, the alternative to GADTs is to just let the compiler give you warnings. For example, if you have a pattern matching over a list that you know is never empty you will write something like<p><pre><code>    -- gives error at runtime if list is empty
    case mylist of
      (x:xs) -> dostuff
      []     -> error &quot;impossible&quot;
</code></pre>
or<p><pre><code>    -- missing case in pattern match gives 
    -- error at runtime and a compiler warning
    case mylist of
      (x:xs) -> dostuff
</code></pre>
What GADTs let you do is enrich your types with extra information so you can write incomplete pattern matches and prove that they will never fail so the compiler won&#x27;t show you any spurious warnings.<p>Its the old tradeoff between static and dynamic typing - more static guarantees vs more simplicity and flexibility.",1444485623

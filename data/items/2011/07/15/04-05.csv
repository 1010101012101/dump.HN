2766294,comment,2765844,2765926,3,0,Kliment,,,"Here is how I understand the problem.<p>At the moment, each commit stores a reference to the parent tree. By parsing that tree and reading the entire history you can obtain a hierarchy of commits. Because you need to order commits in many situations, reading the entire history is extremely inefficient, so git uses timestamps to determine the ordering of commits. This of course fails if the system clock on a given machine is off. With a generation number, you can get an ordering locally from the latest commits, without having to rely on timestamps or read the entire tree.<p>When you have a commit with generation n, any later commits that include it wound have generation >n, so to tell the relation between commits, you only need look as far back as n, and you can immediately get the order of any intermediate commits. It has nothing to do with ""easy to remember"". It's about making git more efficient and robust.",1310704613

I'm wondering what happens when your site suddenly starts getting traffic from Israel, and all your new users are using Google Translate to turn it into Hebrew.

When you have to design a poster that's going to get sent to a printer and plastered over bus stops, everyone waiting all over town is going to see the same poster.  When you design a web page, everyone who sees it gets a separate stream of bytes and a separate display to see it on.

It is particularly annoying when you think options should be available and they're not (or they're not where you think they should be).<p>Honeycomb cleans this up with the action bar. The action bar is on top of the screen and contains whatever actions are currently available. If there are more actions available than what can be fit in the bar, then they get put in a visible overflow menu. The key improvement here is that the action bar is (almost) always visible, so you can quickly glance at it to see what actions are possible (rather than the more complex menu-button flow).",1310702428

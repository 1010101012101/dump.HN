Each hash that gets submitted to the live network &quot;takes a percentage&quot; of the output of the mining pool and of the overall network output.  BFL (the maker, and their upstream vendors for that matter) have privileged access to the newest hardware on the planet at the time when it&#x27;s going to be most valuable.<p>Customers whose orders have been fulfilled have an expectation that BFL (I&#x27;ll grant even, only because they promised so) is not actively working with the money provided by new customers to devalue the good provided to their old customers by the hardware that is their existing sunk cost.  The community rallied behind them, in part because they promised to leave that job to the new customers.<p>You may see it as a waste, but I don&#x27;t think the FTC will agree with you.

8384532,comment,8383422,8384378,1,0,Jtsummers,,,"> Teachers are highly valued in our culture (or at least, valued much more than they are in our economy).<p>Teachers are primarily public servants in the US (before college, and probably even the majority of college professors though I won&#x27;t make a wager on that). Their pay is directly determined by our culture as reflected by who we elect and how we vote on referendums. Clearly, our culture does not value teachers if me choose to pay them poorly with respect to their scope of responsibilities and the time required to perform their jobs. Along with 6-8 hours of instruction and student interaction each day, their primary time for prep and grading is outside of those school hours. Pair that with having to sponsor clubs or coach athletics to earn a little more money to make ends meet (especially if they&#x27;re the primary or sole earner or have children) they have to commit to 12-16 hour workdays throughout the school year. And then we require them to maintain certifications and professional education (not bad things on their own) that require spending losing many evenings and weekends to satisfy (and sometimes money spent from their own pocket just to be allowed to stay in their job).",1412017007

The important difference between the two prolog implementations is that the &quot;longer&quot; version is implemented by (recursive) iteration over a list of [peak] values (and comparing it to a reference list), whereas in the shorter one, the reference values are specified as separate conditions in the prolog rule, combined with logical AND.<p>The separate conditions enables &quot;shortcut&quot; of the match-testing, in a way that the recursive list-parsing did not: As soon as one of the conditions is not met, the current spectrum will be rejected and the backtracking will go on with the next item, while with the recursive list-parsing version each item of the list of values will be compared to the reference [value-]list regardless of whether the current spectra has already been rejected or not.<p>The &quot;shorter&quot; prolog version, with separate conditions, thus enables to order the conditions according so that statistically rare peak values come first (thus, &quot;heuristically&quot;), so that a spectrum can be rejected as soon as possible.<p>Being a heuristic solution, the performance would of course depend on the prior knowledge of the values in the data.<p>But as can be seen from figure 15, both prolog versions beat Jena and Pellet by a large margin, though the &quot;shorter&quot; version did so well that it is even hard to notice an increase of the running time linear to the number of triples in the triplestore, in the diagram.<p>Hope that made it a tad clearer!",1412016733

It was certainly less common for students in my high school (a private college-prep school) to randomly pick up AP CS to look good on their transcripts.

Both of these types of students possess the ability to operate from a place of creativity, but some have yet to develop gut intuition, and feel safer and more confident starting from a place of concreteness, and from there, launching into a more nebulous space.<p>I applaud the author for innovating the CS (and AP CS) curricula and teaching methodology.

8384251,comment,8353006,8354814,0,0,JdeBP,,,"> If someone could come up with a systemd replacement which manages to keep the systemd features while using a design philosophy more in line with that of Daemontools, that would be ...<p>... in the indicative rather than in the subjunctive, and in fact already mentioned here once. <a href=""http://homepage.ntlworld.com./jonathan.deboynepollard/Softwares/nosh.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homepage.ntlworld.com./jonathan.deboynepollard/Softwa...</a><p>> The process manager gets killed. How do you recover?<p>In nosh terminology, this is the <i>service manager</i>.  If it gets killed, the thing that spawned it starts another copy.  This could be systemd, if one were running the service manager under systemd.  It could be the nosh <i>system</i> manager.  Of course, recovery is imperfect.  If one designs a system like the nosh package, one makes an engineering tradeoff in the design; the same as one does when one designs a package like systemd.  The system manager and the service manager are separate, but the underlying operating system kernel will re-parent orphaned service daemon processes if the service manager dies.  One trades the risk of that for the greater separation of the twain, and greater simplicity of the twain.  The program that one runs as process #1 is a lot simpler, being concerned only with <i>system</i> state, but there&#x27;s no recovery in a <i>very</i> rare failure mode.  Indeed, the simplicity makes that rarity even greater, if anything.  systemd makes the tradeoff differently: there&#x27;s recovery in a very rare failure mode (which I&#x27;ve yet to see occur in <i>either</i> system outwith me, with superuser privileges, sending signals by hand) at the expense of all of the logic for tracking service states, and for trying to recover them (in circumstances where one <i>knows</i> that the process has failed somehow and might possess corrupted service tracking data), all in that one program that runs as process #1.<p>> If you have respawn logic for it in PID 1, how do you log information about a failure to respawn the process manager?<p>In the log that is there for the system manager.  See the manual page for system-manager, which explains the details of the (comparatively) small log directory and the (one) logging daemon that is directly controlled by the system-manager, both intended to be dedicated to logging only the stuff that is directly from the system manager and service manager.<p>> Perhaps you build in some basic logic for logging. Where do you store the data?<p>In a tmpfs, just like systemd-journald does in the same situation.  /run/system-manager/log/ in this particular case.  Strictly speaking, this &quot;basic logging&quot; isn&#x27;t built-in.  In theory, it is replaceable with whatever logging program one likes, as the system-manager just spawns a child process running cyclog and that name could be fairly simply made configurable.  In practice, difficulties with the C++ runtime library on BSDs being placed on the /usr volume rather than the / volume, and indeed the cyclog program itself living on the /usr volume when it has to be under /usr/local/, have made it necessary to couple more tightly than wanted here, <i>so far</i>.  But those problems could go away in the future; if the BSD people were persuaded to put the C++ runtime library in the same place as the C runtime library, for example.<p>> Most proposed alternative stacks to systemd falls down on the very first question above.<p>In many ways, that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a poor question that focusses on a very rare circumstance.  As I said, I&#x27;ve yet to see <i>either</i> system exhibit this failure mode in real-world use absent my deliberately triggering it.  (Nor indeed have I ever seen it occur with upstart or launchd.)  Much better questions are ones like &quot;Where are inter-service dependencies and start/stop orderings recorded?&quot;, &quot;Is there an XML parser in the program for process #1?&quot;, &quot;What makes up a <i>service bundle</i>?&quot;, &quot;How do system startup and shutdown operate?&quot;, &quot;How does the system cope with service bundles that are on the /var volume when /var hasn&#x27;t been mounted yet?&quot;, &quot;How does the system handle service bundles in /etc when the / volume is read-only?&quot;, and &quot;What does the <i>system</i> manager do?&quot;.  Those are all answered in the package&#x27;s manual pages and Guide, of course.",1412014635

The &quot;PC revolution&quot; has gone into full reverse. It&#x27;s the revenge of the mainframe and the whole mentality behind it.<p>There&#x27;s many reasons for this, but the biggest one I think is piracy and the general mentality that &quot;everything should be free&quot; (as in beer). The problem is that nothing is free. Everything costs money. Really polished software costs a lot of money.<p>So far three strategies for dealing with this misalignment have emerged:<p>(1) Push everything back to the mainframe and return the user to serfdom.<p>(2) Create completely jailed devices (iOS, jailed Android deployments) linked to completely closed app stores and use cryptography to effectively achieve #1 without having to offload all computation.<p>(3) Create &quot;free&quot; products and services for which the user is the product -- this is the surveillance and manipulation business model of sites like Facebook.<p>I&#x27;ve come to believe that free is actually the enemy of freedom, and that the &quot;pirate party&quot; crowd is worse than wrong. What they&#x27;re promoting is actively pushing us toward a radically less free world. The &quot;everything should be free&quot; ideology creates a complete decoupling between the user and the economics of software and content creation -- so now the only viable business models are either serfdom or exploitation.<p>In a sense free places the user in the ultimate position of disempowerment. Since you&#x27;re not paying there is no reason anyone should care about you or your needs/preferences. It works for content too. In a world where people pay for music, music is made for you. In a world where nobody pays for music, it has to be made for someone else. I envision a future where pretty much all non-hobbyist / starving artist music is made at the behest of advertisers or political propagandists.

One of our statisticians wrote a detailed reply, and here’s the TL;DR:<p>- Optimizely actually uses two 1-tailed tests, not one.<p>- There is no mathematical difference between a 2-tailed test at 95% confidence and two 1-tailed tests at 97.5% confidence.<p>- There is a difference in the way you describe error, and we believe we define error in a way that is most natural within the context of A/B testing.<p>- You can achieve the same result as a 2-tailed test at 95% confidence in Optimizely by requiring the Chance to Beat Baseline to exceed 97.5%.<p>- We’re working on some exciting enhancements to our methodologies to make results even easier to interpret and more meaningfully actionable for those with no formal Statistics background.

It works well and nearly out of the box in Android Studio; after all, it comes from the same company that does IntelliJ, which AS is based on. Not such a bad support in terms of tooling.<p>In IntelliJ at least, Scala &quot;just works&quot; out of the box. And IntelliJ is the tool that you&#x27;d expect to have the best Kotlin support, since as you say it&#x27;s made by the same people. What about third-party tools - New Relic, or Takipi?  What about third-party frameworks? (e.g. there&#x27;s a wicket-scala project - it&#x27;s not perfect but it takes a lot of the pain out of interop. I haven&#x27;t used spring-scala but it seems like the same kind of thing)<p>> It&#x27;s 100% interop ensures that you can only implement bits and pieces in Kotlin, not necessarily the entire app. So you don&#x27;t have to jump into it head first and commit yourself entirely.<p>Scala&#x27;s interop is actually more complete than Kotlin&#x27;s - without existential types you can&#x27;t express some types that it&#x27;s possible to write in Java (e.g. nested bounds like <? extends T<? super...).<p>> But I&#x27;m already happy with the advantages Kotlin has over old Java, Android&#x27;s Java. It&#x27;s fancy enough.<p>If there were maturity or ecosystem advantages to Kotlin then I&#x27;d agree - after all, that&#x27;s the reason I use Scala rather than Idris :P. But like I said, it seems to come with all of Scala&#x27;s disadvantages, and fewer of the advantages.<p>And there&#x27;s an element of the &quot;blub paradox&quot;; when I first started using Scala I wrote code that was more or less &quot;Java without semicolons&quot;. Then I started using options. Then I started using case classes. Then I discovered that I could use the for/yield syntax to express some &quot;wrappy&quot; problems much more elegantly. Then I needed to make this work for collections, and I could abstract that. Then I discovered I could reuse the same code to handle a bunch of different abstractions, and that Scalaz already contained the most useful ones.  And so on. Even today (after four years in the language) there are corners of Scalaz where I fear to tread, but at this point I&#x27;m confident that I&#x27;ll need them sooner or later.",1412013823

Chicago, Philadelphia and NYC all use hack to refer to legally licensed cabs and they&#x27;re all much larger cities/metropolitan areas than Baltimore. I think this is why it is much more common to use &quot;hack&quot; to describe a legitimate taxi driver. Thank you for your input.",1412013725

Then repeatedly pick the queen that is attacked by the most other queens (if/when there are multiple, pick randomly), and place it in the spot where it is attacked by the least other queens (if/when there are multiple, pick randomly). Repeat until you have a solution.",1412013691

It is not perfect, it is built on Yahoo's search api and should get better as it serves more results.Since I have already coded a Social search site, I reused most of the code and hence the page retains the social aspect of my Social Search Site. Firefox and IE7 users can also download a search plugin, which will enable them to search from the search bar in their Browsers (no toobar!). If someone is interested in tagging news.yc/building a human edited directory for news.yc, get in touch with me; I have already started doing it.",1190131175

56312,comment,56232,56232,0,0,colortone,,,"Thought experiment:<p>I'm going to try and synthesize a strategy for facebook from  Marc Andreessen's post on platforms from yesterday, the follow-on discussion on AVC, and this post from Bubblegen...<p>1. Getting ""open"": for the near/medium term, facebook needs to become a ""level 3"" platform, where complementary services are able to <i>themselves</i> capture value.  (I suspect that the facebook people see this already, but, then again, they might be ""evil"" ;-)<p>2. In the long run, the Net itself is the ""platform""; I don't know what the service they might provide in that world (5+ years?), but I suspect it's <i>nothing</i> like the facebook of today.  Maybe something that manages the portability of your personal info/history?<p>Any thoughts?",1190129004

I've had success finding apartments though.  <p>The difference with dating sites, though, is that they only work when members are active, aggressive, and open with their personal information.  They work best in a way that spammers will rush to exploit, at which point everyone gets frustrated and stops using the service.  This doesn't stop spammers, and pretty soon the ratio of valid profiles to fake ones is ridiculously small.",1190128621

Assuming constant cell size, which cells would I lose? Or do they shrink the atoms too? Wouldn't the required pressure needed to pump blood through my veins go up? Terrible, terrible question (for computer scientists at least, might be great for biologists).<p>But I think 9, 13 and 16 are predictive of certain logic skills that you'd need for e.g. debugging.

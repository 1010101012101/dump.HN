2772019,comment,2771031,2771031,16,0,shadowmatter,,,"I did a math minor at UCLA, and he taught the upper-division linear algebra class I took. He didn't like the book, so he decided to write his own lecture notes, which formed a book unto themselves. They're still available online at <a href=""http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/resource/general/115a.3.02f/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/resource/general/115a.3.02f/</a>. If you ever have the itch to learn linear algebra, read them, they're quite excellent.<p>It was pretty obvious at class and obvious hours he was crazy smart -- but I had no way of knowing he was Fields Medal smart. But unlike other crazy smart professors I've had, he's a very gifted teacher as well. I mostly learned by reading the books and considered the lectures as an ancillary learning aid, but his lectures were very illuminating. I'm glad he now has a blog to teach a wider audience at <a href=""http://terrytao.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://terrytao.wordpress.com/</a>, but unfortunately most of it is beyond what I can understand. If you're a math die-hard, be sure to read that.",1310856738
2772018,comment,2771202,2771202,2,0,nxn,,,"A few months ago I was writing a little application where I was doing a lot of asynchronous calls in javascript and having to track their completion to do some other stuff, it resulted in this:<p><pre><code>  // Synchronizes asynchronous calls: sync(functions..., completionHandler)
  var sync = function() {
    var argLength = arguments.length - 1
      , completed = 0
      , callback  = arguments[argLength]
    
    for (var i = 0; i < argLength; i++) {
      arguments[i](function() {
        completed++;
        (completed == argLength) && callback && callback();
      });
    }
  };
</code></pre>
It pretty much takes a number of functions that perform asynchronous operations and execute a callback function upon completion of whatever the async operation is. Once they're all complete it calls the last function it received as a 'completion handler'. Example that I wrote out without bothering to test at all (treat it as pseudo-code):<p><pre><code>  var pageData = null;
  sync
    ( function(cb) { $('#pageContainer').fadeOut('slow', cb); }
    , function(cb) {
        $.ajax(
          { url: 'page.html'
          , success: function(msg) {
              pageData = msg;
              cb();
            }
          }
        );
      }
    , function() {
        $('#pageContainer').html(pageData).fadeIn('slow');
      }
    );
</code></pre>
So that will start by beginning the jQuery fadeOut animation on the pageContainer html element, while immediately doing an ajax call to get another page's data. Once both operations are complete, it will take the new page data, put it into the pageContainer element, and fade it back in.",1310856719

By exposing an authenticated API proxy you're allowing anyone to abuse someone else's API using your key, likely leading to them banning you. At a minimum you should implement your own rate limiting.<p>Likewise, with a JSONP proxy you're allowing other sites to circumvent the browsers' same origin policy to access that API, which could also lead to abuse. At a minimum you should restrict requests to ones with a recognized HTTP Referer header.<p>Of course with JSONP you also need to trust that the API isn't doing anything malicious, like injecting cookie or other data-stealing JavaScript instead of valid JSON.

They would of course be fully capable of interconnecting <i>between</i> other networks throughout the site, but the goal here is sharing among people in your local group of like-minded people.

John Deere & Co.</i>[1]  That part of the <i>Graham</i> opinion is definitely worth reading for anyone who has to deal with the U.S. patent system. The Court observed that:<p>--snip--<p><i>[Jefferson] rejected a natural rights theory in intellectual property rights and clearly recognized the social and economic rationale of the patent system. The patent monopoly was not designed to secure to the inventor his natural right in his discoveries. Rather, it was a reward, an inducement, to bring forth new knowledge.</i><p><i>The grant of an exclusive right to an invention was the creation of society -- at odds with the inherent free nature of disclosed ideas -- and was not to be freely given. Only inventions and discoveries which furthered human knowledge, and were new and useful, justified the special inducement of a limited private monopoly.</i><p><i>Jefferson did not believe in granting patents for small details, obvious improvements, or frivolous devices. His writings evidence his insistence upon a high level of patentability.</i><p>--snip--<p>(Extra paragraphing added.)<p>The Court noted that Jefferson clearly recognized the difficulty of ""drawing a line between the things which are worth to the public the embarrassment of an exclusive patent, and those which are not.""<p>These Jeffersonian views have been part of the underpinnings of U.S. patent policy for decades.<p>[1] 383 U.S. 1 (1966), available at <a href=""http://supreme.justia.com/us/383/1/case.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://supreme.justia.com/us/383/1/case.html</a>",1310853873

That violated a Honduran law which that country no longer enforces, but because it’s still on the books there its enforced here. “The lobstermen had no idea they were breaking the law. Yet three of them got eight years apiece.” When the article was published 10 years later, two of them were still behind bars.<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s a pile of shit: <a href=""http://www.eenews.net/stories/1059964426"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eenews.net/stories/1059964426</a>.<p>TL;DR version: they were arrested and convicted for importing over $15 million in illegal lobster tails. The plastic versus cardboard boxes issue is a red herring--it was the means by which they concealed the undersized tails, not the primary basis for prosecution. As for the Honduran law--the Court of Appeals determined that the Honduran law was in fact valid during the relevant time period. Moreover, the Lacey Act only criminalizes importing animals harvested in violation of a foreign law when the importer knows or should know about the law. The prosecution proved that the defendants took measures to conceal the undersized tails and evade inspectors.",1429480786

Roland has some nice machines starting around $5000, and those are real, shipping products.<p>I&#x27;d really like to see PocketNC deliver.<p>Milling software remains a problem.  For 3-axis machines and simple work, there&#x27;s the Cut2D/Vcarve/Aspire line, which is easy to use. Most work at TechShop uses that program.  At the high end, there&#x27;s Hypermill - $22,000 a seat, but you get your money&#x27;s worth.[1]  Look at the videos of it controlling a 5-axis machine, with long thin tools working deep through narrow openings, without screwing up. In the middle, there&#x27;s SprutCam, from Russia, which is startup-grade software - clever, but buggy. (I&#x27;ve used it.)  Since in the CNC business, bad software results in rejected parts and tool and machine damage, buyers are unwilling to buy bad software.<p>There&#x27;s some open source software for CAM, but it&#x27;s below Cut2D, which is considered entry level.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnIvhlKT7SY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnIvhlKT7SY</a>",1429480677

It just means that the banks can lend most of the asset, and must keep back a fraction for liquidity purposes (in case a depositor wants some of their asset back).<p>In many ways Fractional Reserve Banking would be much more risky with bitcoin than with banknotes; with banknotes at least there is a lender-of-last-resort central bank. The central bank can create additional money at will to lend to a bank that is in a liquidity crisis, to see it through the crisis.

9405017,comment,9403385,9404955,0,0,derefr,,,"1. ADHD can come and go, like the major depressive episodes of clinical depression[1].<p>I had 5+ years of experience (I started programming when I was 11, in fact); my period of homelessness came <i>after</i> having already worked several great jobs (that I got no thanks to my parents—a retired tradesman and a gas-station attendant with a combined income of $20k/yr.) I&#x27;ve also built out a pretty good portfolio of work in realtime distributed systems engineering. I &quot;burned out&quot; of one job I had at the time, and just never looked for the next one. I lived off savings[2] for a year while trying to start a startup, until my savings ran out. Then I was homeless.<p>2. I was eliding a lot by saying that I was living with my parents. My parents are bankrupt, now divorced, and live in the country. (My father is bipolar, which drove much worse things to happen in their lives for decades—a string of half-baked entrepreneurial ventures each dropped after heavy investment whenever he entered his depressive phase, for just one. Moving out at 16 was a decision I still do not regret.)<p>I actually went to live with my grandparents, illegally, in their no-tenants-under-the-age-of-retirement condo, because they insisted that I stay with them even though they couldn&#x27;t afford to support themselves, let alone me. (They certainly couldn&#x27;t bail my parents out.)<p>This was a move that caused me to be two hours&#x27; commute from the nearest city of population greater than 10,000. While looking for a new job, I commuted that distance, both ways, nearly every day. It wasn&#x27;t that I wasn&#x27;t actively looking for a job; it was that each individual job application was, effectively, an arduous process it would take weeks/months to recover from. The strain I put on them was what made me finally decide I needed to see a psychiatrist.<p>That was only for the last few months of my &quot;stint&quot; at homelessness, though. Before then, I was just ducking my almost-always-absent landlord, effectively squatting in the room I had previously been renting, and trying to scape together a dollar or two each week to buy bags of rice and such.<p>Should I also mention that I mostly paid for living expenses while going to [community] college—for the year or two I did—by getting student loans and then avoiding spending them on anything non-essential, like textbooks?<p>3. I was never on welfare, or employment insurance, or on any government assistance programs of any kind. You know why? They were too much effort to get into! Also, they effectively required applications to their services to happen near-simultaneously with the loss of one&#x27;s job. One of the most common effects of ADHD is putting off paperwork, homework, filing your taxes, etc. until it&#x27;s far too late.<p>I was homeless, but I wasn&#x27;t a beggar on the street. Instead, I was couch-surfing without a dollar in my bank account, tens of thousands of dollars in credit-card debt, no friends within a thousand miles of the city I lived in, and a rapidly-worsening state of health because I couldn&#x27;t pay for my own healthcare.<p>4. I wasn&#x27;t hired as CTO; the previous CTO quit, and I worked my way up. This isn&#x27;t a big company, so just think &quot;tech lead&quot;, not &quot;guy in an expensive business suit who bosses around tech leads.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve never mentioned having ADHD to anyone at any job I&#x27;ve worked at since beginning treatment for it. Medicated, I&#x27;m normal; just as a nearsighted person wearing glasses is normal. Effectively, in my mind, I don&#x27;t have ADHD now—ADHD is a condition I would <i>get</i> (again) if I stopped taking my medication.<p>ADHD is a deficiency of an essential chemical my body cannot produce on its own—to wit, a vitamin deficiency. Do we say that people with scurvy always have scurvy, but were are just temporarily well as long as they continue to consume vitamin C? No; they&#x27;re normal on vitamin C.<p>---<p>[1] I&#x27;ve almost come to believe that all the talk of &quot;burn out&quot; in programming is because ADHD is pretty common in programmers—or rather, programming is a pretty common thing to get into for people with ADHD—and so, to someone who has undiagnosed ADHD but to a degree that&#x27;s normally manageable with self-medication through things like caffeine, a stressful+unrewarding job can heighten the symptoms to the point that it can&#x27;t just be managed/brushed aside, and has to be addressed as a problem. But, since it required the triggering event (a bad job), it gets blamed on the trigger-condition instead of on the vulnerability it exposed.<p>[2] Savings amounting to a few thousand dollars. Junior programming jobs here don&#x27;t tend to pay well, nor was I very savvy about what I should charge for the contracting work I did, nor was it very easy to get hired by places with money given my lack-of-a-college-diploma. I did figure it out the general solution, in the end: working remotely for US companies, instead of accepting the local prevailing wage.",1429480400

They take 10-15 minutes to come online from a cold start and sync with the grid. Gas peaker cold starts are expensive - the plants I&#x27;ve looked at (GE, mainly) allow some number of cold starts before the plant has to be taken down for service. But keeping them hot (spinning reserve) is expensive, too.<p>The fix for rapid PV ramp rate is enough storage at the PV site to give ~ 15 minutes of continued nominal output when insolation drops out. This is enough time for classical grid management tools to be engaged.<p>One driver for the equipment upgrades needed to deal with reactive power compensation, etc., is the price premium paid for &quot;ancillary services&quot;, or power supplied at short notice for grid stability/management needs. The multiple over normal, average power pricing can be 100x depending on the circumstances.<p>When residential inverters are smart and can respond to utility signals, then residents can participate in the ancillary services market.

9404974,comment,9402728,9402728,0,0,alanpost,,,"> The essence of make is this: make is an implementation of constructive logic programming<p>To be perfectly pedantic, the essence of make is that it is an expert system for traversing a directed acyclic graph (DAG).<p>It works by constructing a graph of “filenames” (vertices) and the commands required to create those files (directed edges). Using that as it’s knowledge base, make performs a reverse topological sort on the target filename to determine the graph traversal necessary to create it’s target file, and runs each command in the traversal so as to arrive at that target. Since it has a list of all intermediate vertices that must exist before it’s target can exist, make is further able to determine whether it needs to run a command or whether it can use the cached result.<p>I don’t think the author is doing us any favors by trying to fit make’s behavior in to a constructive logic system. It’s missing operators for doing that, as the author states: “Note that the form of compound propositions allowed is extremely restricted, even by the standards of logic programming.”<p>I find the author’s conclusions then a mixed bag. They would be good conclusions if make was a constructive logic system, but it’s not, it’s an expert system for traversing a DAG. I think of make as a “workstate” system: do what you need to do to put my build in a particular state, whereas most of the author’s conclusions center around “workflow:” move this unit of work through it’s lifecycle.[1] Make only performs that work incidentally to putting your build in a particular state.<p>1: The workflow/workstate distinction is not my idea. It’s explored in “Adaptive Software Development” by James A. Highsmith III.<p>[I originally made this comment at <a href=""https://lobste.rs/s/rqf3f5/propositions_as_filenames_builds_as_proofs_the_essence_of_make/comments/p9m9ng#c_p9m9ng"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lobste.rs/s/rqf3f5/propositions_as_filenames_builds_...</a>]",1429479352

While that can happen, a lot of the time you can carry the debt forward, as the article illustrates well.<p>The bigger problem with technical debt is that it limits or slows your ability to do things.  With real debt you have to make monthly payments and that reduces the total amount of cash you have to spend, which reduces your flexibility.  With technical debt you &quot;make a payment&quot; whenever the speed you can make changes is reduced due to bad technical decisions of the past.<p>For example, if you don&#x27;t have tests then you can still change the code, but you have to spend a great deal longer doing manual testing.  When the inevitable bug slips though, you have to spend the time to fix it.  Since it&#x27;s often not catastrophic, non-technical management will be willing to pay a known ongoing cost instead of an large, unknown one-time cost to remove the problem altogether.<p>At my last job we were so mired in technical debt that progress had slowed to a near standstill.  It was a 20-year-old codebase running on an IBM AS/400, mostly written in RPG (which is sort of like assembly language but for databases.)  Field and table names were limited to 11 characters.  When they migrated the product to the web, they kept the RPG code but added in a bunch of perl.  When DB2 couldn&#x27;t keep up, they started adding new data to MySQL.<p>In all, there were 500 thousand lines of code in the system.  Adding a field to the most important table was a 20 hour process, including a late night or two to issue some commands while the system was doing its nightly maintenance.  There were five programmers while I was there, and the majority of our time was spend keeping the system going.  There was never time allocated for cleaning up the existing system, so instead we&#x27;d just try and add features without making any schema changes (or adding fields in MySQL instead, as I mentioned before).",1429479172

That is interesting because off the top of my head I don&#x27;t think there is any scenario in music recording where it becomes cheaper to go analog. I believe, in general, analog recording is more expensive.<p>You are correct, my apologies. From the producer standpoint, analog recording techniques offer few benefits compared to digital.<p>I didn&#x27;t argue from an aesthetic viewpoint because I don&#x27;t think the aesthetic viewpoint is worth arguing about, in that it&#x27;s generally a non-productive conversation that ends up in &quot;well I prefer x because it feels better than y&quot;. Although, I will argue one particular point: I find that vinyl creates an &quot;equalizing&quot; factor when listening to older music alongside newer music, whereas the increased clarity and lower noise floor of digital makes 50s/60s/earlier recordings sound considerably worse than contemporary recordings. A result of this is that when listening on vinyl, I am better able to look past poor recording quality and make decisions based on artistic quality. This, however, is merely a personal preference.<p>> It seemed as though you were using the term &quot;hipster&quot; to imply vinyl was more about style and trend. If that is the case, I wouldn&#x27;t characterize the sonic differences between analog and digital recordings as simply &quot;hipster&quot; differences. There is a quantifiable difference between an analog and digital wave. Not saying one is better than the other but they are different.<p>I will direct you to this very enlightening page: <a href=""http://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Myths_%28Vinyl%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Myths_%28Vinyl%29</a> -- in my view, the only quantifiable differences in audio between vinyl and digital is that vinyl has a worse noise floor, a generally smaller &quot;usable&quot; frequency spectrum (the highs deteriorate pretty quickly), and includes surface noise, hum, rumble, etc.<p>I think the revival is hipster. I collect vinyl because it&#x27;s often the only place to find certain genres of music (such as western swing and classic honky-tonk country), but I am generally hesitant to buy a pressing of a contemporary recording. I will do it, though, because I like having the physical product, but that <i>is</i> a stylistic decision more than one based on necessity/actual audio differences.",1429478538

It doesn&#x27;t say anything close to that.  That wouldn&#x27;t even be mathematics.<p>> Physical laws, as far as we can tell, are Turing computable.<p>Not true either.  Where are you getting this idea?<p>I accept the materialistic thesis.  I think people are conflating this thesis and the statement of whether human thought can be simulated on computers.  That doesn&#x27;t follow.  A computer and the universe are not the same thing.  They work in different ways and have different laws.<p>> Why couldn&#x27;t they? Why couldn&#x27;t an AI convince someone to do what they want?<p>I&#x27;m not saying they couldn&#x27;t in principle.   I&#x27;m not even rejecting strong AI in principle.<p>I&#x27;m saying that in practice, with the current state of technology and reasonable extrapolation of it, this possibility is beyond consideration.<p>There isn&#x27;t a credible technical path from specialized AI to strong AI -- where we would be &quot;surprised&quot; that we developed it, and it would all of the sudden take over the world.  If we are close technologically to strong AI, we&#x27;ll know it.<p>The alternative would be like &quot;accidentally&quot; creating an atom bomb, without the Manhattan project (to borrow an example from Bostrom).<p>> Do you say we shouldn&#x27;t worry about climate change because it&#x27;s in the future?<p>We absolutely should worry about climate change because we have lots of evidence that it&#x27;s happening, and will continue to happen.  That isn&#x27;t the case with strong AI.<p>What this article, and other AI practitioners, are saying is: The idea that computers could overthrow us all of the sudden is based on a technological misunderstanding.<p>FWIW in college I was very interested AI: reading Kurzweil&#x27;s books, considering myself a futurist, etc.  I now work at Google in the same department as Kurzweil, Deep Mind, Quantum Computing, etc.  Though I don&#x27;t work in AI per se, and I&#x27;m not an expert in it, I&#x27;m very excited about specialized AI (which is here), and also the possibility of strong AI.  I say that even though strong AI hasn&#x27;t been proved to be possible in principle: we may need a different mode of computation, in addition to multiple other algorithmic / scientific breakthroughs.<p>I&#x27;m saying that we don&#x27;t have to worry yet.

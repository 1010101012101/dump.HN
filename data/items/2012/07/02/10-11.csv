4188276,comment,4186031,4188138,1,0,lusr,,,"Yes, I believe that images (encodings of electromagnetic radiation of particular wavelengths) and audio (encodings of mechanical waves of pressure) are universal concepts aliens are also likely to be familiar with, whereas understanding the information encoded within the transmission requires interpretation within a context we are highly unlikely to have here on Earth.<p>This is just my intuition and speculation but I would guess somebody could formalise some support in terms of Kolmogorov complexity (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity</a>):  there are only so many ways to represent an image or audio, and over time an intelligent race will discover the least complex method and use it.  Therefore, alien races of equivalent levels of technical advancement in a given field should be able to decode raw (uncompressed and unencrypted) transmissions of common types of information (images, audio).<p>Any additional complexity on top of this method will probably be quite structured, e.g. with television signals we have portions of the signal that are blank because during that time the CRT of old televisions would be retracing and not displaying data.  (Actually, I believe these ""dead"" portions of the video signal are sometimes used to send additional structured data, e.g. Teletext, which would make the structure of the signal even more apparent.)<p>I suspect it'll be much easier to look at alien video transmissions and figure out what they're about than trying to listen do the same with audio transmissions because video would provide objective context (assuming it's not just a video of talking alien heads, or whatever the equivalent of a ""head"" for them would be).<p>With respect to encrypted transmissions, if the entire protocol is encrypted from start to finish, and you're using the right cipher* then no, you can't distinguish encrypted data from random noise.  This is the principle behind TrueCrypt's hidden volumes (<a href=""http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=hidden-volume"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=hidden-volume</a>).<p>* What's the right cipher?  So far no nobody has found a distinguisher for AES, and that's in common use, so that's probably good enough to make an alien race blind to us;  i.e. we could be picking up signals from a race as sophisticated as c. 1998 humans (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard</a>)  without realising it.",1341226017

4188180,comment,4184850,4184976,3,0,cookiecaper,,,"freenet is probably the most reasonable alternative since the content is distributed amongst clients, and therefore there is no central point that can be ""shut down"" by governments. The downside, of course, is that almost no one will see your content on freenet (or a smaller darknet) and whether that still counts as ""publishing"" in the same sense as getting a publicly-available server connected to the internet. If you are doing something like WikiLeaks where you're really relying on normal news outlets to do the real legwork for you, this may be feasible, but if you aren't doing that for whatever reason, it practically would be the same as saving a text file to your hard drive -- i.e., no one, or almost no one, will ever read it.",1341223640

4188178,comment,4184317,4184317,1,0,brunorsini,,,"The article reminded me of a brilliant passage from one of Schopenhauer's essays (""On the Vanity of Existence"", Section 5):<p><i>Life presents itself first and foremost as a task: the task of maintaining itself, de gagner sa vie. If this task is accomplished, what has been gained is a burden, and there then appears a second task: that of doing something with it so as to ward off boredom, which hovers over every secure life like a bird of prey. Thus the first task is to gain something and the second to become unconscious of what has been gained, which is otherwise a burden. (..) For if life, in the desire for which our essence and existence consists, possessed in itself a positive value and real content, there would be no such thing as boredom: mere existence would fulfil and satisfy us.</i>",1341223604

4188173,comment,4187787,4188032,9,0,drostie,,,"Agreed. What they inherit from koans appears to be merely the violence that the koans take for granted. \nMy favorite example of this is the story of Gutei's Finger:<p><pre><code>    It is said that Master Gutei would always raise a finger wisely when\n    teaching about Zen. Now in his monastery there were young boys studying\n    to be Zen masters themselves, and one boy, when he was asked questions\n    by his teachers, began also to raise his finger when answering Zen\n    questions. The teachers told Gutei about this and Gutei summoned him to\n    a rare audience with the master! Gutei asked him a simple question which\n    the boy could answer confidently, and the boy raised his finger as he\n    responded.\n\n    Gutei immediately grabbed the finger and in one motion cut it off with a\n    concealed knife. The boy screamed and ran to the far side of the room.\n    Gutei called him to stop and return, and the boy recovered his composure\n    and plodded back in front of the master. Gutei raised his own finger\n    before the boy, and in that moment the boy was enlightened.\n\n    Indeed, on his deathbed Gutei's last words were: ""My teacher Tenryu\n    taught me the Zen in my finger, and though I used it my whole life, I\n    couldn't use it up.""\n</code></pre>\nI think the first thing anybody notices about this story is just the violence. When I told it to my brother he asked, ""the lesson is, do not f--k with the Master?"" But there is a deep set of Zen ideas -- lifting fingers which you do not have, and not getting attached to idiosyncrasy. Perhaps the boy even thought, ""I should cut off the Master's finger,"" as he attained enlightenment.",1341223452

I've managed to achieve what I suspect is comparable to Railgun by simply having this compression applied on a multiplexed TCP tunnel in rather large blocks, so that packets from multiple sessions are compressed together.  It worked really well, it enabled me to offer reasonable fast content delivery to clients with servers on small leased lines in Africa.

No you don't.<p>>They only introduced the SDK once the API was in a usable state and they got the necessary documentation and infrastructure in place to support 3rd party developers.<p>I have an acquaintance who has this bizarre tic that when he can't afford or obtain something, and strangely feels defensive about it, he rationalizes his self-perceived inadequacy by claiming that he was intentionally putting off getting whatever he didn't have (girlfriend, BMW, leather couch...the list was endless) until he could have perfection. It is doubly effective, in his mind, because it also subtly denigrate people who did have what he didn't, insinuating that they settle for second best.<p>Everyone, but apparently him, saw right through it, but it kept him feeling good I guess.<p>I see this same rationalization with Apple. It essentially opines that if Apple isn't doing something, it isn't because Apple is behind the ball/lacking, it's somehow because everyone else is lacking.",1278338336

1488191,comment,1487744,1487744,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> So, for the last 30 days, my mission has been to finish stuff. It's amazing how much change this one small item has made, every day, both 'in real life' as well as in all the online stuff it looks like there is a way to reach that 100% complete state after all.<p>Strange - I set a very similar goal a month ago. Actually, two goals. One is to finish stuff.<p>The other is I want to become ""prolific"" in general - I want to do a hell of a lot of stuff at 60% good, and make a sequel if the 60% good version is a hit.<p>I just saw this today:<p>> The main theory proposed by Simonton is that creative genius is simply a product of random and possibly unrelated ideas being combined in an interesting way through the combinatorial process. Simonton then makes a series of assumptions. From his theory and the assumptions, he concludes the existence of the equal-odds rule, which has been supported by empirical data. The equal-odds rule says that the average publication of any particular scientist does not have any statistically different chance of having more of an impact than any other scientist's average publication. In other words, those scientists who create publications with the most impact, also create publications with the least impact, and when great publications that make a huge impact are created, it is just a result of ""trying"" enough times. This is an indication that chance plays a larger role in scientific creativity than previously theorized.<p>Submitted it here but it didn't take:\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1487777"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1487777</a><p>I'd like to finish more, but I'd also like to ship more stuff when it's 60%. I'm using 60% in the sense of, ""When you're 90% done, you're half finished."" I'd like to put a fast coat of paint on 90% done/half-finished stuff and get it out the door, then be on to the next thing.<p>Edit: I think wanting to finish things and being comfortable calling something finished at 60-90% done are basically two sides of the same coin, they're both ways to eliminate this feeling:<p>> That way I can stop worrying about still having to do all that stuff too.<p>So you can either take immediate, decisive action to fix something, or you can be comfortable ignoring it knowing that you're doing a hell of a lot of valuable stuff good enough, and giving yourself a blessing for shipping the good enough version <i>and moving on without letting it bother you</i>.",1278338136

We have lots of ideas, but not an army of people working on them I'm afraid :)<p>To answer your other question: our use of different SSL libraries on the client and server side are largely historical.

But for those people, it's really the suck - and that's a lot of our demographic. Freelancers, business owners, and self employed people often have a very hard time getting their credit started.<p>> I can easily understand if you had bad credit record but not having one at all being a showstopper really puzzles me. Most people pay their credit card bills anyway so any random newcomer to the business is probably a safe bet.<p>I thought about that too. The credit card companies have very sophisticated metrics and algorithms though, and they seem to think lending to someone with no credit is a very bad idea because they're incredibly hesitant to do it. My best guess is it's a defense against fraud.",1278337249

1488156,comment,1487292,1488017,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> You're entirely right. Which is why I really did hate myself a bit for posting it. I normally notice bad grammar (especially small errors like this), move on, and don't think again about it. Sometimes, though, the urge is too strong.<p>I'm with you, I understand. I've got a heavy reading/writing background, so I notice too and used to be pedantic about it. Letting it go was huge for me, which is why I'm such an advocate of not caring about grammar. It really isn't so important to most people as long as you're communicating effectively.<p>> and I have a history degree as well as a CS one.<p>Ah, cool, I love history. Hey - want to recommend me a random history book or two you like? Obscure is cool, mainstream is cool too. I'm reading Julia Cartwright's ""Baldissare Castiglione"" right now - really wonderful reading. It's out of copyright and free here, really wonderful reading if you like that era:<p><a href=""http://www.archive.org/details/baldassarecastig02cartuoft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.archive.org/details/baldassarecastig02cartuoft</a><p>> The one thing that surprised me about your reply was the choice of 'money' as the metric that I can maximise by suppressing the habit. That has certainly never occurred to me. The thinking behind it seems interesting on a few levels.<p>Well, it's the most concrete, but I mentioned producing more and being happier too.<p>Have you read Stephen King's ""On Writing""? It's worth checking out. The first half about his life is a mixed bag, but his writing advice has some really excellent points in it. The thing that's interesting to me about King is that so much of his work is trash - I mean, really bad and cliche. ""Oh, the overbearing mother just did something morally wrong to try to protect her weak son - I wonder if the son is going to die in an ironic way for that?""<p><i>But it doesn't matter</i>, because King comes up with interesting premises and writes things that are interesting. He's not a master of language most of the time, but he sells books. And in a literary dogfight, I'd take The Stand straight up versus 95% of the works from ""serious writers."" King <i>produces</i> - he gets stuff out the door. Sometimes it's cliche, sometimes his grammar or structure sucks, but you know what? It doesn't matter, because he delivers stories that people want to buy and read. So King is getting stuff out the door that people wants. It's made him more wealthy, able to create and produce, and from reading his autobiography he seems a lot happier now with money than he did when he was struggling.<p>Making grammar not very important as long as you're understood - the reason you do it is so you can put your attention on what people really want. Almost nobody wants grammar, they want the message to get across. I intentionally break grammar rules a lot with commas and dashes in inappropriate ways - it's the fastest way for me to write something that can be understood. Grammar be damned if it's getting in the way of speed or communication or what we really want.<p>> ...mean that there is bound to be at least one grammatical error in this reply. Doh!<p>See, that's the beauty of it - I understood you so I don't care! :) Now if you have a free minute, I would be much obliged if you'd recommend a couple favorite history books of yours. :) Cheers and best wishes.",1278336631

Further, he can't see why, and so keeps pressing his point.<p>If P=NP then it's plausible that a gifted, enthusiastic and persistent amateur can prove it, although they will most likely then have a difficult time convincing the establishment.<p>If P!=NP then it seems very unlikely to me that an amateur will prove it, and be able to demonstrate to the establishment that they have done so.  Even though it's the result most mathematician's expect, a proof is going to be difficult. Not knowing the standard language for talking about these things (which will almost certainly be the case of an amateur who proves it) will be an insuperable barrier.<p>There are a lot of results floating around already showing that certain ""obvious"" approaches won't work.

1488129,comment,1487690,1488032,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Interesting discussion this!<p>Indeed!<p>> Rome was pretty centralized, so was the British empire at its peak.<p>You think so? I'm rather under the impression that the Crown set a loose grand strategy, and then let their high ranked officers and local personnel run things as long as things were going according to plan. If taxes were coming in and nothing too crazy was happening, they wouldn't get in and start micro-managing. Rome... lots of different eras of Rome, again I think Rome was more hands-off in its local provinces and would let the local people keep their customs, worship, morality, and rough template of local laws so long as the taxes, infrastructure, supplies, and garrison were generally in order.<p>> And federal seems to be winning that battle but not in a way that I can understand.<p>Cyclical - the federal government collects much higher tax revenues and then makes the states pander to get the money back. So the states are forced to set up the education programs the federal government wants, the driving laws they want, etc, etc. Nominally education is state-run, but in reality it's all handed down by the Board of Education (which is also why it's dysfunctional and ill-catered to individual students). For all the love Reagan gets, a lot of people overlook how he expanded federal powers in morality laws and took that decisionmaking away from individual states. Things like that. If federal taxes went down, I think a number of states would raise local taxes and provide their own services to people who want them. A relatively small reduction in federal taxes could have a huge cascading effect on federal power and give it back to state power.<p>> Also it is difficult to compare historic governments with current ones in the same sentence because the circumstances those governments operated in were so dissimilar.<p>Yes, very true. Also, the modern historical record is often flawed and misrepresented so you have to dig around in archaic primary sources to get a real idea of how things really happened at different times. It's quite a challenge to understand how things even really were back then, and then extrapolating them to now is a burden too.<p>> For instance, the 'nation' of Greece back then had a populace that would comfortably fit in a mid sized town baseball stadium. So methods and techniques used in antique times have relatively little bearing on what we can do today.<p>Yeah, good comment. Looking at history more carefully, I was amazed at how <i>small</i> some of the historical battles were. Oftentimes an elite unit of like 400 troops were the backbone of one a conqueror's army. I think Tokugawa Ieyasu had less than 600 troops for the first half of his career, something like that. Kind of puts it into perspective.<p>> Agreed on the rest of what you wrote and a nice eye opener about the 'organizations', indeed, individuals are the way, but then individual education is a very big problem on the horizon, and one that so far has not been solved in a way that is satisfactory so that you could put significant power in the hands of individuals by democratic means. It would lead to ruin quite quickly and dramatically so I would imagine.<p>Yeah, education is quite the challenge. I always wonder why Americans wanted direct election of senators instead of indirect election? The ability for corruption, lobbying, and bribery skyrocketed, so did the emphasis on short term decisionmaking. Before that, the people would elect the state legislature, and the state legislature would elect the Senators. A state legislature would have many representatives that were much harder to bribe/lobby... now that money can go directly to senators' campaigns. If you want democracy, why ignore all the lessons of democratic government through the years? Having two layers of elections (people elect state legislators, state legislators elect senate) means the people don't need as much education, as long as even 1/3rd of a state legislature are competent, they can discuss and persuade another 20% and get a competent, uncorrupt senator in, who reports directly to the more-educated-than-average legislature. Why they changed that, I don't know, the results have been predictable - massive increases in lobbying and official and unofficial corruption, much more short term thinking, much more emotional-based unthinking politics...<p>Anyway, good discussion and lots to think about, cheers.",1278335582

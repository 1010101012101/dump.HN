It's only because of their bullshit ""hard line on (something allegedly bad)"" or from making a big deal about their piety and ""clean lifestyle"", that they're susceptible to such pranks in the first place. Reasonable people unconcerned with maintaining a squeaky clean image would indeed just laugh it off.<p>I think it's fine to mock stupidity in all its forms, so the archaic superstition of religious belief is fair game. I'd be equally fine with mocking racism, homophobia, any other religion, etc - all of which, you'll note, would also be susceptible to this kind of attack. Coincidence?<p>Anyway I think you're well aware of my views from other discussions so I won't repeat myself.<p><i>what kinds of jokes we can make against ethnic groups? Minorities?

I think I recognise this problem - this is a case where the customer does <i>not</i> know what they want, because they lack the necessary background to formulate their needs or define their future direction. People without systems engineering experience usually constrain themselves to their perceived understanding of a solution when trying to express their needs.<p>For example, if you went to a customer five years ago and said ""how would you like to edit your documents"" they would have described a word processor to you - not Google Docs or Zoho and certainly not Etherpad - it would never occur to them to ask for those features. But show them those features, and they love it.<p>I have come to believe that you don't ask your customer what they want. You try and guess what <i>you</i> would want in their position, and put that forward as a straw man proposal. The customer has enough mission-specific knowledge to help you perfect your mental model, but they are rarely going to ask for anything innovative of their own accord.<p>There is a <i>huge</i> potential payoff in banging the right heads together.

779688,comment,779329,779444,0,0,Locke1689,,,"This is the correct way to prove the summation. Although, I would point out that for r > 1, it's probably better to phrase it as ( r^(n+1) - 1)/(r-1). However, it's important to note that this is only true from a series starting from zero. For a series starting from m it is:<p><pre><code>  (r^(n+1)-r^m)/(r-1)

Which is trivially deducible from your method or the parent's method. For some reason I tend to dislike geometric proofs. This is probably because I find it very easy to make proof fallacies visually, more so than symbolically. However, this geometric proof is also less useful than the symbolic because it is much harder to use it to prove the summation at values smaller than infinity, whereas the symbolic works just as well for n.",1250968928

Sass allows me to apply the same modularity and reuse principles to my CSS that I do to my code, so writing it is much faster and editing it is much easier.<p>I played with a few other CSS processors over the last few years (Less, Moonfall, one or two others) but Sass is clearly in the lead.

1290699,comment,1290688,1290688,0,0,th,,,"The letter grades A and A+ are equivalent to 4 ""grade points.""  A- is 3.7, B+ is 3.3, B is 3.0, B- is 2.7 and so on.  If someone has a 4.0 this means they received an A/A+ in every class.<p>Depending on the university and the professor, this can mean different things.  If the class is curved, one third of the class will probably receive A-/A/A+ range grades.  If the class is not curved, anywhere from 85% to 95% may be considered an A depending on the professor, class, and university.  Most commonly a 90% range is considered A- and up and 80% range is B- and up (assuming no curve).<p>The overall GPAs themselves are usually calculated by taking specific units of each class into account to give some classes more weight than others.  For a 4.0, all grades must have been A anyways so this detail is insignificant.<p>3.7 and 3.5 are often considered very good GPAs in university.  Receiving an overall 4.0 GPA is fairly rare at many schools as an receiving even one A- or below would ensure less than 4.0.",1272105376

Whenever I read an article about some smart person, there is usually a line that says - he graduated with a 4.0 GPA. My understanding from Wikipedia is that he either scored a perfect value on all his tests, or he got above a 90% on all his tests.<p>What does a 4.0 mean? Does this mean the person never failed to get below a 90% on every single test that he ever took at the university? Is this a linear system where 90% actually means that 9 out of 10 questions were correct?<p>What's the perception of other scores like 3.7 or 3.5? Are those considered low?<p>Do people have the chance to go back and correct an exam where they scored less than 90% or are these 4.0 people really that smart?",1272104124

I never really wanted to join the network - like some of the posters here, I saw something like this coming and told myself it wasn't worth the investment to join Facebook.<p>After four months of using it, I've come to several conclusions.<p>1) Facebook is a huge timesuck. Time I used to spend reading on the Internet, or programming I now spent watching stupid videos on Facebook itself. What Facebook needs is a noprocras feature (but even then - the content isn't worth the time).<p>2) Related to point 1: I began to think that what Facebook really does is to use my need for connection to keep me returning to the site. And I didn't like that. It felt as if ... well it feels as if they're trying to use my friends for their benefit.<p>3) Superficial communication != valuable communication. There is no centralized discussion on FB, and your profile page tends to be this highly decentralized echo chamber. How many people, if ever, argue against your (bad) ideas on your very own profile page?<p>4) Privacy has always been and will always be an issue on a social site this big. It's too easy to mess things up.<p>And so, after four months: I'm quitting.",1272103242

If I had to hazard a guess, it&#x27;s the controller aggressively maintaining the charge of the flash cells [1]. Samsung released a fix, not too long ago, for a bug with flash cells losing charge for their 840 and 840 Evo SSD line [2], so I imagine it&#x27;s a delicate process to get right. Are the other NAND controllers less aggressive and/or more efficient with this process? I don&#x27;t know. I assume it&#x27;s the same flash cells as the SATA drives but with a PCIe-oriented controller, so I hardly expect them to lose charge any faster than the SATA counterparts.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.purestorage.com/resources/introduction-to-flash-memory.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.purestorage.com/resources/introduction-to-flash-m...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/8617/samsung-releases-firmware-update-to-fix-the-ssd-840-evo-read-performance-bug"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/8617/samsung-releases-firmware...</a>",1428011865

The 6502 is not a very good target for C compilation, pretty much any assembly programmer can code circles around what cc65 produces. So, no offense to you or anyone else that writes C for 8-bit machines, but I don&#x27;t think any of the new games and programs that really &quot;push the limits&quot; of these machines are written in C. So that leaves modern cross assemblers, which are indeed much more capable than common target/native assemblers of the olden days, but don&#x27;t exactly afford a quantum leap of productivity either.<p>Then again, modern emulators are a godsend for debugging.",1428011051

But when you get down to it, they&#x27;re not hard to use and have a high success rate when used properly.

And then we look at the low rates for condom use and we conclude that the deficiency is with the condoms? Please.<p>Could we and should we be working to improve condoms? Of course. Are such improvements subject to the law of diminishing returns? Also, of course. You&#x27;re just not going to get paradigm shifting results through busywork, any more than you&#x27;re going to get order-of-magnitude improvements in wheel design. A condom is always going to be basically an elastic tube that&#x27;s closed on one end, just as a wheel is always going to be a circular structure that rotates around a central axle.<p>I feel for the guy in the article who got unlucky and contracted HIV, but when he&#x27;s talking about people iterating on things like salt, pepper, and olive oil every year - no they&#x27;re not. They market it slightly differently, the basic product has seen very little change in <i>thousands of years</i> - much like condoms. Unless we discover drugs that are cheap and have a broad-spectrum prophylactic effect against STDs and pregnancy, we have to be realistic about the prospect of small incremental improvements rather than great leaps forward in this area.",1428011050

(You&#x27;ll probably want to look up the diamond lemma for the second.)<p>The Wikipedia article is surprisingly bare.  There&#x27;s a lot more known about sandpiles than that.  So, this seems to be an appropriate time to infodump on some basics. :)<p>For instance, you can consider sandpiles on finite graphs (a vertex topples when the number of grains on it is at least its degree).  Of course, this will never terminate by itself, but if we designate beforehand one of the vertices as a sink, then (assuming the graph is connected) it will.<p>We can then ask which configurations are reachable (by adding sand anywhere) from any other configuration.  (For instance, the configuration where all vertices are just about to topple is necessarily reachable from any other configuration, by just adding the appropriate amount of sand to each vertex).  This is often phrased in terms of Markov chains -- we consider a random process where you choose randomly which vertex to add sand at, and these are the recurrent states of this process.<p>Then in fact the number of such recurrent states doesn&#x27;t depend on the chosen sink, and is equal to the number of spanning trees of the graph.<p>Not only that, you can actually make the recurrent states into a (commutative) group -- the group operation is to just add up two states vertex by vertex, and then topple to get the result.  Note that the identity in this group is not the all-zero state, because that isn&#x27;t recurrent!  (Well, unless your graph is a star graph and you chose the center to be the sink.)  Again, which vertex you pick as the sink doesn&#x27;t matter; the groups you get this way are all isomorphic.  They can also be defined more intrinsically, without picking a sink; look up the &quot;Jacobian group&quot; or &quot;Picard group&quot; of a graph.<p>Sandpiles are also studied under the name &quot;chip-firing games&quot;.  Another term to search on.  There unfortunately seems to be a proliferation of names for the same thing in this field...",1428009491

It&#x27;s cheaper for a merchant than the 3% of a CC, Stripe, Paypal, Square etc.<p>If you want to look at the consumer side, that&#x27;s a different story. You tend to conflate things in your arguments. It&#x27;s not required to buy from Coinbase to spend at a Coinbase merchant. I&#x27;ve been paid in bitcoin at 0% fees, and I&#x27;ve bought bitcoin at Circle at 0% fees.<p>> About 0% of Microsoft&#x27;s revenues are in Bitcoin, this increases Microsoft profits by about 0%. Accepting Bitcoin is a marketing expense, not about increasing profits.<p>Stupid. First of all, quote my entire sentence. Secondly, it&#x27;s easy to show you a ton of examples that were once small, but became significant. The internet was 0% of revenue for many companies once, where it&#x27;s now extremely significant. It&#x27;s not an argument to say something is small, therefore lacking any potential to be or become meaningful. One of its core characteristics is that it&#x27;s cheaper. If you can cut costs as a merchant by 3% by using Bitpay (0% Saas) versus say Stripe (3% ish), that&#x27;s massive when you have 3% profit margins like most supermarkets, airlines, a lot of retail etc. You can double profits on any sale. Does that mean bitcoin is a massive game changer today? Of course not, but again to ridicule it is as silly as to say the Internet is shit in 1995 because barely any calls, mail, ecommerce, education etc ran on it. Fact is, any sale Microsoft makes with Bitcoin is more profitable than otherwise, and that&#x27;s not an insignificant fact despite the small scale of bitcoin sales.",1428009465

Or any of the BSDs, but OpenBSD would be ideal.<p>That said, my confidence isn&#x27;t exactly shaken either by the current lack of BSD availability (FreeBSD is supposedly &quot;coming soon&quot;).  I&#x27;m getting by moderately well on Linux right now for my own &quot;cloud&quot; needs.  It would just be nice to have my preference in operating systme (and ecosystem; I&#x27;ve taken a liking to OpenBSD&#x27;s subprojects like relayd/httpd, OpenSMTPd, etc., and it&#x27;s much easier to use these things on OpenBSD - or probably even on FreeBSD - than it is on GNU/Linux).",1428008726

Don&#x27;t short yourself on this because it is basic and you don&#x27;t want to be struggling with it at the same you are struggling with the higher level stuff. I cannot recommend Sheldon Axler&#x27;s Algebra and Trigonmetry highly enough. After much searching I found that and have been through it 3 times.<p>Next Calculus: I recommend Gilbert Strang&#x27;s text book which will take you through what in uni is called Caculus 3, 1 being intro, 2 being differential and 3 being integral. I in the midst of this book and so can&#x27;t speak to further but my plan is to move onto Strang&#x27;s linear Algebra. After that, where to go depends on particular interest but leaving any of that out, in my opinion, will just handicap your further studies.

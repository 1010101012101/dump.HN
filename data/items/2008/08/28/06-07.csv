On the other hand if you set guidelines (we'll tolerate small amounts) people will go right to the line - so you don't.<p>Instead you look the other way most of the time.<p>And it works.",1219906654

288932,comment,288168,288390,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"Also, what's wrong with the question ""how do we get to 100 apps?""  In the VC's position, I might have asked the same thing.  In his position, I'd have been impressed by that question.<p>In most creative endeavors, quantity leads almost inevitably to quality.<p>If there is some change in technique, or some application of capital, that would let your company crank out LOTS of apps instead of a few mostly-pretty good apps, then the VC is absolutely right to suggest it.  Write so many apps that you can throw away that bottom 50%, and not even notice.<p>John Lennon and Paul McCartney became expert songwriters by writing an incredible quantity of songs.<p>There are creative ways to leverage talent.  What's stopping all those ""mediocre"" developers from building apps?  I'd bet that at least 1 in 10 of them are better at it than you or they think, or at least, would be with a little practice.  How do you take advantage of that?<p>It's up to you to know how to set up virtuous spirals, not the VC.  If you can't do that, then why should they give you money?",1219906040

Building a webapp in a day is taxing, but a lot of fun. But these are just ... webapps, not usable webapps.<p>So at news.YC, we have a great collection of people who are interested in Webapps. It would be a great idea to crowdsource together, to build an useful webapp, with a deadline of a week. (This part is important! :) )<p>What we need:<p>An Idea: Let us all propose ideas, as a new top level comments, and discuss them. Vote up trhe ideas you like, and we can agree on the most promisisng idea.<p>Development: A lot of us here are developers, so I don't think this should be a problem. For whatever this is worth, I would be willing to deveote a significant amount of time next week to this.<p>Design: I don't think there are a lot of designers on news.YC. If we can find designers who are willing to be part of this experience, cool. Otherwise, I think I can convince my partners at www.Uswaretech.com, to sponsor a reasonable money for the designs.<p>So what are we waiting for? Let's get started!<p>[Edit: Formatting, of course]",1219905815

In case of Adobe and Microsoft piracy actually <i>creates</i> income.<p>If we didn't have pirated MS Office and Adobe Creative Suite folks would improve openoffice.org and the GIMP/Scribus/Inkscape instead and these monopolies would die and lose everything.<p>Piracy actually helps software monopolies to be de facto standards and kills all alternatives (or keeps alternatives unusable).<p>Thus software piracy ""steals"" only our own freedom.",1219905643

The night we submitted our application to Y Combinator, we found out my wife was pregnant with our first child. The hardest decision my wife and I made was me going off to do a startup while she remained in AZ. We bought video phones and used Skype video conferencing every night to stay in touch. The video phones helped a ton, especially since I only made 1 trip back home in the 3 months. Looking back it was absolutely the right decision for me, the family, and our future - but it sucked not being around her for 3 months.""</i><p><a href=""http://pioneerit.blogspot.com/2007/04/my-innoview-with-wayne-crosby.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pioneerit.blogspot.com/2007/04/my-innoview-with-wayne...</a>",1219903676

Now add in that most young developers don't have much exposure to anything beyond pure software, and it leads to 80% chasing the same 5% of application domains.<p>This is arguably one of the advantages of experience: you're more likely to have been exposed to a wider set of problems, many of which are not being addressed (well) by software.<p>It's not at all a difficult box to break out of, but the easy part is finding an application domain that you can build stuff for. The harder part -- without having experience in that field -- is figuring out how to reach your prospects. Many of these areas have little to no web presence. It's easy to say ""just look at a few forums"" but that doesn't help if your customer base isn't online at all.",1299531533

The very meaning of all political labels is contested:  people abuse them constantly for their own purposes, so they do not carry the same meaning for all people.  For example, ""socialism"" can be anything from an oppressive government that ruthlessly punishes success to neighbors banding together to help each other out in times of trouble.  Or it can be used as a simple insult.<p>The problem isn't that these words have no meaning, the problem is that people are fighting over what these words should mean.

2298616,comment,2297902,2298448,0,0,10char,,,"I was actually thinking about adding this as an epilogue. I'll summarize my thoughts real quick:<p>- Biggest difference is making interfaces, both in terms of tools and higher level philosophy. Having Linear/Relative/Table/etc Layouts is a really foreign concept to iOS developers, who are used to just using two sets of pixel dimensions (320x480 or 768x1024). Once you get some practice with them it's not a big deal, but its definitely one of those things that originally made me stop learning Android dev on my first try. At the same time, it's necessary to have all these different ways of laying out data to cope with the device fragmentation. There are tools built into Eclipse and elsewhere (DroidDraw) that give you a graphic representation of what you're doing, but they're not as tightly integrated into the development process as Interface Builder is to iOS.<p>- Related to that point, I feel like it's just a lot easier to do complex and custom interfaces on iOS. I haven't delved too deep into this on Android, but all of the really awesome Quartz features for manipulating and animating views just don't exist (although I heard 3.0 is trying to change that).<p>- Dealing with touches is something <i>much</i> more deeply ingrained in iOS than in Android; from what I've heard, it's actually non-existant in pre-2.0 APIs. I believe there's just not concept of a UIResponder-esque chain of handling events, which sucks because those form the backbone of really cool interfaces that iOS apps are known for.<p>- All that being said, it was actually pretty enjoyable once I got the hang of it. Things like ArrayAdapters are really useful and my code was more modular because of them. Now, if Apple got around to bringing all the Bindings and NSObjectController magic to iOS...<p>tl;dr the Android SDK (pre 3.0) seems better suited for business-as-usual apps than the gorgeous interfaces you find on the App Store.",1299531113

Programmers are often quite happy to write much more complicated and redundant programs if it means not having to learn about graph theory. Not that they think of it that way.

Sure, maybe they took Calculus in high school and have a PHD in whatever metaphysics but does that mean they are better adjusted to take advantage of all the opportunities that money has bought them? In fact, if you have 2 kids, one rich and one average, the rich one being socially ill-adjusted (because his parents were hyper-ambitious) and the average kid being happy-go-lucky, smart, and resourceful (because his parents nurtured his childhood with love and taught him the skills of problem solving and confidence), assuming they had the same opportunities, which do you think would do better in an interview?

I wanted to prove that I'm badass and don't need my money to give me advantages!""<p>It's pretty much a cliche among rich people these days. By starting at the bottom they gain pride, confidence, and bragging rights. I remember this one rich girl whose dad was close friends with the CEO and who got a very highly coveted and prestigious position in the company.<p>She would repeat over and over again (I probably heard it 20 times) how when she applied for the job she hid her identity, because she wanted to earn the job on merit.<p>Naturally, her extraordinary sense of entitlement and being protected gave her tremendous psychological advantage over competitors and she beat them out.<p>It's just not cool anymore to be given something, it's much cooler to prove you're better than the poor kids by playing their own game far better than they can do.<p>Of course what these people choose to ignore is that the poor kids are living paycheck to paycheck, can barely afford to buy new shoes, have to clip coupons, are constantly looking at homeless people and realizing that could be them tomorrow, etc.<p>The rich kids are just oblivious to the fact that rent, food, clothing cost anything at all. They are oblivious to the fact that getting fired in a bad economy can lead to homelessness.",1299528012

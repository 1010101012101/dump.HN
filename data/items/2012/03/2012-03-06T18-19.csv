3672302,comment,3671993,3672261,7,0,chc,,,"In practice, even in the standard library, this isn't followed often enough to rely on. Here's a (possibly incomplete, since I'm writing this on the fly) list of bangless mutating methods just from Array:<p><pre><code>  pop
  push
  shift
  unshift
  <<
  clear
  replace
  delete (and friends)
  keep_if
</code></pre>
As an even more extreme example, IO contains precisely one bang-method, despite the fact that probably 75% of IO's instance methods are destructive.<p>The general rule seems to be that if there's a mutating and non-mutating version of the same method, the mutating one will get a bang, but when there's a mutating method with no counterpart, it <i>might</i> get a bang but probably won't.",1331060379

The user has 2 comments in 4 years, and only 2 submissions which are not self promotion (one of which is yours).<p>I couldn't find a trace of the other two, though looking at your account (or what I think is your account) I am seeing a slew of filtered posts, some of which are on topic, some of which are not.  I just approved a couple of your most recent on-topic posts, however I can tell you that you will need to keep a good ratio between your own site(s) and other good content for the spam filter to go easy on you.  It filters really heavily against people who submit the same domain a large part of the time, and we (moderators) tend to stick to that as well.<p>I will comment on your other points in a little while.<p>EDIT:  Okay, now for the rest.<p>I think the warm fuzzy memories you have of proggit are akin to the warm fuzzy memories a lot of people have of reddit as a whole 3 or 4 years ago.  But with a larger userbase comes a lot of noise and idiocy.  In my opinion, /r/programming was one of the first subreddits to take real action against quality decay.  There was a period of time, after the heyday, but while /r/programming was still a default, when rage comics and advice animals were rampant.  Maybe not quite as rampant as the rest of the site, but it was pretty bad.  There were lots of people who were not programmers submitting and commenting, so lots of stuff ended up being off topic.<p>I think the quality has improved immensely since then, and I think this is in part due to strict moderation and the disabling of self posts.  I will allow that it certainly isn't as great as reddit as a whole was in its heyday, but it's getting better.<p>There's not much we can do about the comments.  We can't moderate comments for stupidity (because that would be pretty messed up).  The only thing I've ever moderated comments for is spam and personal info.<p>A reboot, unless it's in the form of a different sub, is probably not going to happen, but I'd certainly be interested in hearing any ideas for improving the subreddit in its current form.",1331060063

With Facebook and Google tracking everything you do, whether you are logged in or not, I would go one step further, and say all of these things are directly attributable to you personally.<p>I would strongly urge young people to really think about what they are putting out there. Consider this, the military was doing the equivalent of credit checks for sensitive positions during the 60s. Now you need a credit check to do ANYTHING, even things that don't require credit. How long before an internet and phone background check is standard in the background checks organizations do before offering jobs?<p>I can tell you the military is doing this sort of screening right now for sensitive positions, but at least you are confronted about it. It still basically ends your career, but they will give you a chance to explain your posts. In the private sector in the future, they will just deep six your application and you won't know what happened. Or they'll let you in at entry level, maybe, and subsequently you'll start running up against an invisible barrier as you try to advance beyond the first or second layer of management. Or you will find resistance to you advancing into management at all.<p>Also be mindful, it can affect more than your professional life. Think about what the background checks for apartments will look like in the 2020s. Or what 'dating sites' will be like in the 2020s.<p>Please consider your future before you make comments on ... say ... black people and Hurricane Katrina ... that might be misconstrued. Or post an opinion on ... say ... American soldiers in Afghanistan ... that could be taken out of context and viewed in a negative light.<p>All that said, the absolute best defense against these sorts of situations is just not to be a douche, which isn't very hard...""<p>----<p>I think that comment is apropos here as well. I encourage all of the young people I work with, as often as I can, to be careful about what comments they put ANYWHERE on the internet. To be mindful of what they say during ANY cell phone conversation.

When you look at the deep reasons why a large codebase went sour, you're not blaming it on things like list comprehensions, you're blaming it on things like ""Java strong-arms us towards building abstractions with only OOP, which over the course of a few years builds into indecipherable layers of implementation inheritance, causing high defect rates and much decreased agility"".<p>The difference between CoffeeScript and Javascript, in terms of what a team can accomplish, hasn't been proven in production-scale projects. they may be, or maybe only for some teams, or maybe they aren't, but you can't debate something without being able to articulate the opponent's position.<p>update: interestingly, ClojureScript may be a language where the productivity delta from javascript is much larger, and is better worth it. clojurescript introduces new ideas and idioms to the js community, where coffeescript is an incremental update to javascript with no new ideas.",1331059758

    if ([[data objectForKey:@""posterUrl""] isKindOfClass:[NSString class]]) {        
</code></pre>
They weren't right next to each other, and at a glance, I misread to assume they were doing the same thing.  There's too much shit in the way of the actual differences (NSNull vs. NSString in this case) that I have a bad tendency to gloss over the details.  Coming from ruby, the closest syntactical equivalent:<p><pre><code>    if (data['released'].class == NilClass) {
    if (data['posterUrl'].class == String) {
</code></pre>
Is so much clearer to me when glancing through code.  That doesn't even touch on how you'd actually write that sort of thing (data['released'].nil?) which is infinitely more concise than either example.  I know this is a bit of a contrived example, and I certainly could find better ones.  I just find the 120 character long method evocations to consistently blur the details for me, and this just happens to be the freshest instance.<p>To be fair, I've only been doing iOS stuff for about a month.

So NSString has `stringByAppendingString:` because you're asking for a new string, while NSMutableString has `appendString:`, which is essentially the same as it would be in Ruby except with an allowance for Objective-C's static type system.<p>What really creates the impression that Objective-C speaks in terms of nouns is that Cocoa tends to promote immutable objects more than Ruby does (e.g. the only way to get an immutable string or array in Ruby is to freeze a mutable one, while you'll almost never get a mutable array in Cocoa unless you create one yourself), so you probably do spend more time asking your objects for other objects than you do in Ruby.<p>Although the verbosity can get overwhelming, I actually like this about Objective-C.

The supposed motivation for the no-bitching rule is that the interviewer thinks you'll complain about their company in two years.  Well yeah, no shit, if you get fired or quit in two years, you're not going to run around telling people what a pleasure it was to work there, and that the breakup was mutual.<p>The people who seem to say every place they worked was good, had a good team, had no problems, etc, always seem to be mediocre.  The interviewee who's like ""Oh my god, they didn't even use source control when I got there.  I setup a subversion server on my desktop."" shows that they take charge.  Horror stories about bug tracker shenanigans are always good for a laugh.  ""Well 'critical' was getting used too much, so they created 'ultra-critical'.  After all the bugs ended up at that status they added 'yesterday'.""  Funny, but also shows they understand the concept of prioritizing.  The people who bitch, and (more importantly) take the steps to make things better are the people I want to work with.<p>Of course it can be overdone, and I've had people who bitched so much or were so caustic that they got a pass.<p>I guess maybe things would be different if I was working in Fortune 500 IT-land.  Maybe then I wouldn't want someone who complains about Fortune 500 IT-land shenanigans, and just want someone who will just implement the code written by the Grand Architects on Mount High.  But it's like the rule about wearing a suit and covering up any tattoos.  I will never wear a suit to an interview again.  If that's a pass, that's a company I don't want to work for.

I use Basecamp everyday as well, but we are also dependant on ""Time"", although I side with the philosophical argument that the ""Time"" feature <i>is</i> essentially useless. I would want to get rid of it, too. Here's why: project managers like to think it's a way of predicting the next project timeframe. It's a giant fallacy. In no way, shape or form, does Time keeping give you any sense of what to expect, so for that reason - I applaud removing it. However, Mr. Project Manager isn't happy. And when he's not happy, I can't use your new Basecamp. Once that sets in as a consciousness and we feel 'Classic', someone is going to start hunting for an alternative. Based on this thread, I'd wager someone is currently tying all of your features + Time together and imposing the ""You don't have to be 'Classic' any more!"" marketing ploy.<p>> If we had tried to reimplement every single Basecamp Classic feature in Basecamp Next before we launched, it would have taken a very long time.<p>As a software developer, I understand this.

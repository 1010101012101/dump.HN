We don't decide what goes into scholarly journals based on a public poll, I don't see why we should do that for an encyclopedia.<p>EDIT: If one accepts the premise that even wikipedia requires curation and cannot simply include all submitted articles, then it follows that one of the tasks of the editors is making value-judgments about what knowledge is interesting and important to wikipedia's readers. I assume the guidelines about notability, conflict-of-interest and whatnot are attempting to set forth policies that assist in making these value-judgments.<p>You appear to be arguing that the only basis for making this value-judgement is recognizability to a layperson. I'm having a hard time understanding why this is a suitable metric.<p>I doubt that having lots of information about porn stars will benefit wikipedia's readers. It might entertain them, but I don't think it has any scholarly benefits. At the same time, I don't see how removing information about scientists benefits wikipedia's readers.

(I'm no longer a student, so I fall outside the stated bounds of most internship programs.) My postdoc runs through the spring of 2013, and I won't leave them in the lurch (in math, postdocs teach as assistant professors), so I'd like to gain some experience next summer before deciding whether to stay or switch careers.<p>2. What would make me a better job candidate? What languages and programs should I definitely learn? (I've heard some suggestions already, but I don't want to anchor anyone's reply on those.)<p>3. Will the particulars of my mathematical background help me? I've published a few research papers in the area of harmonic analysis, but they're very much pure math. (I could pick up the applied stuff in signal processing and related fields much faster than most.) How could I find jobs where that's an asset to me?<p>4.

3322486,comment,3322280,3322280,5,0,twoodfin,,,"I think Microsoft really missed a good bet by not embracing NaCl years ago. They have a huge preexisting native codebase. Probably a plurality of their development teams are native code-focused. Their customers employ hundreds of thousands of native developers and probably billions of lines of native code. C/C++ is such an inescapable part of their ecosystem that after almost a decade of selling C#/.NET as the future, they're increasingly proselytizing for the benefits of native code and C++11 in particular.<p>They could have leveraged all of this by buying in to NaCl and putting it into IE. Hard to see how Google says no, and once Microsoft has that level of commitment to the technology, they'd get a strong say in its evolution. As a multi-vendor standard with an open source implementation, NaCl could have gotten real traction, and suddenly every C++ developer inside Microsoft and working for their customers has a path to the web for existing code that's <i>slightly</i> more plausible than rewriting everything in JavaScript and hoping the VMs get faster without also killing your laptop's battery (unlikely, I think).",1323232979

3322454,comment,3322082,3322283,5,0,wheatBread,,,"This is my project. I agree that the type of link is a little weird. This was added pretty early on in the project and I haven't circled back around to rethink it. I'll try to address your questions:<p>- Why is text necessary?\nElements are all rectangles that have a uniform set of functions that can be applied to them. Strings are definitely not rectangles, and I think it is important that the type of String and Element are not conflated. In that case what does (++) do when given an Element? It just wouldn't work out.<p>- Why is text unescaped?\nThat's pretty much an implementation oversight from when I was first starting the project. Strings should be exactly what you intend to display. I have been meaning to go back through and fix up the underlying string representation, but I just don't have time right now. I have been focusing on the theoretical aspects of reactive programming for my thesis which is my main priority at the moment. Nonetheless, this will be fixed eventually!<p>- Why (link :: String -> String -> String)?\nMy thought when I designed it this way was that part of what it means to be a string includes styling (bold, italic, etc.). Following this idea, this would have to be true of characters as well, so (head (link ""/"" ""Elm"")) would give you a character that is a link. I honestly think that's a little weird. I,ve gotten questions about this before, and I'm not exactly sure what the right answer is. The other option is to include an intermediate type of strings that does include style information, but then you need to lift normal strings up to this type to do concatenation (unpleasant). Doing this right is going to be really hard, and I haven't given it the time to really figure it out. I'll probably include ways to use markdown (or HTML) which will alleviate some of these issues. If you have suggestions on this topic I'd be interested to hear. It's harder than it looks :P<p>Also, let me stress that this project is VERY young, so there are still many kinks to be worked out. There is no download available now. With upcoming thesis deadlines, I probably won't have one up until spring of next year at the earliest. Thank you for your interest!

Not just JS! I think this actually an extremely important distinction! It differentiates the project from templating libraries which still ultimately have you think and write in HTML. It also distinguishes it from scripting languages (like CoffeeScript) which also only address part of the problem. With Elm, you shouldn't need the mental model imposed by HTML and CSS which I think will be a really great thing.",1323230504

My personally favorite is the FabLab House <a href=""http://www.fablabhouse.com/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fablabhouse.com/en/</a> which is very ""green"" (passive cooling, good roof designed for efficient use of solar, etc) but also demonstrates building houses from wood shaped with CNC machines.",1282377542
1622455,comment,1622185,1622185,0,0,vl,,,"One house item which shows no progress on the green side is the refrigerator. Obviously it should be a split system: fridge is inside and heat exchange outside the house. If it's hot outside, I don't want fridge to heat up air inside the house so then my AC has to cool it (an you know, my house has quite limited AC capacity). If it's cold outside, I don't want fridge to consume energy - just dump excessive heat outside. It puzzles me for years why with all this green movement I haven't seen a single split fridge yet.",1282377495

It's like oil - it's all pretty much the same, so it doesn't matter whether you boycott Venezuela and specify that the oil you buy must come from Brazil rather than Venezuela, since that just means someone in Brazil will buy Venezuelan oil for you or a potential Brazilian customer would switch to Venezuelan. The oil flows where demand is.<p>> This is especially true when getting more is very difficult. The price is likely to go up in the future, making even more sense to hold on to it.<p>The price has to go up beyond the opportunity cost and one's discount rate. One doesn't invest in a merely profitable activity - one invests in the <i>most</i> profitable activity, and if that isn't bigger than one's discount rate one just consumes rather than invests.<p>If helium goes up 2% a year but Treasuries return 3%, then the savvier merchants will sell helium and buy Treasuries, and laugh at you all the way to the bank.",1282377321

He also says that US supplies will be gone within 15 years.<p>2010+15=2025. 2025!=2015. So unless he is having a serious senior moment, he must be talking about something <i>other</i> than the federal stockpile being gone by 2025.<p>From context - 'supplies', not 'stores' - I read this as a prediction about the US oil industry's production of helium in the course of its operations.<p>This is in fact a prediction, since many things could change US helium production from ending in 2025; an asteroid could destroy us all, new helium pockets could be found, taxes could shut down US oil exploitation, etc.",1282377057

It turns out, shipping food thousands of miles by train or barge doesn't use much energy relative to the amount of food shipped; as the article mentioned, most of the energy usage comes from the consumer, not the grower or shipper.",1282376950

I had one annual inspection that cost ~$3K -- it could have cost $750 or $8K -- you just never know what's going to break next, and in most cases, you cannot just decide to fix the problem later.<p>An airplane is <i>very</i> different from a car. If the plane has a problem, it must be fixed, within a certain time frame, by an FAA licensed mechanic. Maps and charts are updated frequently, and you are <i>required</i> to have current versions on hand. If the aircraft panel GPS is approach certified, you are <i>required</i> to have updated data if you want to use it for IFR approaches, and on and on. I spent about $10K getting my license, and another $10K getting my instrument rating.<p>Yes, you can skimp here and there, but there's just no way around it -- flying is not cheap, even if you sell your plane for what you paid for it.<p>All that said, it's worth every penny. A few years ago, I flew by myself, just for fun, on a clear autumn day from Palo Alto, CA to Little River, in Mendocino County in the northern part of the state. Flying at 7500 feet, I watched the sun set over the Pacific and light up the peaks and western slopes of Sierra. I told the controller I was going off-frequency for a moment and turned down the radio. I could see a ship or two on the water, the Russian River valley below me, and what seemed like the entire width of Northern California spread out across a 270 degree view.

In the interactions I've had with both computer and science start-ups ( admittedly a small sample set, 3 companies ), I never actually seen this, though maybe I've just lucked out.  By and large the fellow devs or engineers did either take care of it or make sure someone was taking care of it as soon as an issue came in.  It's not about altruism, it's just that's the best way to convince people to part with their money.<p>As a 'support manager' / back-end coder myself now, I try to follow their example.  Got to agree with you that having a dedicated support person might be nice, but I can't imagine it becoming common ... first for the reason you mention, but also the types of people attracted to the instability of start-ups usually wouldn't respond well to 'oh no, John, don't muck about with the code/schematics, we want you to be customer focused'.",1282376353

I'm sure I didn't know about thermal atmospheric escape when I thought this, or probably even that a gas at a temperature consisted of molecules with a random distribution of kinetic energies centered on that temperature.  I think I just thought that there would always be stuff denser than helium that would push it further and further away from the earth, without limit.  (This is almost true, but most of the solar system is filled with hydrogen, which is less dense than helium.)",1282376301

Easily the most massive energy consumer was the refrigerator - I would have cut that energy use by 2/3 if I could have figured out how (conveniently) to do without a fridge.  My Hot water came from the building, but, at 97 degrees, and northern california water pressure, I know I was probably in the lower 5% of consumers in that space as well.<p>Just hitting the breaker to all your wall warts / WiFi when you leave to work has a very significant impact on energy consumption.<p>Scott Adams touches on one very, very good point - Having Northern exposure (in an apartment not on the top floor) means (in Redwood City) that from about April through late September you will never be uncomfortable.  Apartments have awesome insulation - though I guess it's possible I was leaching heat during the winter from five of my neighbors and the hallway.

At this point in the game, it's almost necessary to know someone more popular than you in order for your channel to get noticed.<p>I've worked with many YouTubers (I'm Ryan's co-founder), and can honestly say that they are nice people who appreciate each other's talents and want to help others like them succeed.

He's a very very cut and dry, straight and narrow, ultra-law abiding, patriotic type fellow.<p>We see a guy tagging up a wall with spray paint - not artistically, just vandalism. I say to my friend, ""Should I go stop him?"" See, I hate seeing stuff get destroyed. I usually stand up to bullies, thieves, vandals if I catch them. I'm a little bit trained in martial arts, enough that I feel safe, and I figure someone's got to look out for society.<p>My friend, very straight and narrow, he says, ""Nah, nobody stands up to the government here. Let him have his civil disobedience."" What a shocker for me! But then he tells me the government has been somewhat bad to the people, and only now are people feeling safe to push back a little.

I appreciate that you used the word 'culture' before your argument but it's still wrong to use the word 'Islam' before 'culture'. It's just culture. Not Islamic culture.<p>Salaam. I'm not sure exactly what to call it, but yes, it is a culture of some places, not necessarily the religion itself.<p>> If the ""West"" is incompatible with Islam, then by that same logic it's also incompatible with Christianity and Judaism.<p>Indeed, a lot of modern thought positions itself as incompatible with any traditional religion, and there are conflicts between modern thought and traditional religion.<p>> The practices that you mention are heinous and looked down upon by a lot of people, myself included.<p>I don't think that way, myself - a close friend of mine in London is Muslim, and I've eaten at his home. The men eat in the dining room, just men, then they leave and just the women eat. I ate with my friend, his father, and his two brothers. Then the mother and two wives ate. I don't think this heinous. I also don't think a culture where women cover themselves a bit more than people do in the West is heinous.<p>> I'm Egyptian American myself. I'd invite you to take a look at some of the more modern Arab or Muslim countries.<p>I've spent time in Dubai, I'll probably be in Turkey, Morocco, and Egypt in the next 12 months. I think there's conflict between some modern thought and some traditional thought that's near irreconcilable, though I agree that Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have more in common with each other than they do with modern philosophies that replace traditional religion with social causes. But I fear at this point I'm making friends with neither side of the debate - for what it's worth, I respect Islam quite a lot, particularly the hospitality, charity, and sense of duty in Muslims that I've met is rather incredible. Though, some Muslim practices are at perhaps irreconcilable odds with some modern philosophies that seek to replace religion in society. But perhaps not - in any event, I wish you well, and thank you for the discussion.",1282374103

517722,comment,517638,517638,0,0,dantheman,,,"I think this is a great tool, but once again the problem is with the data.  It's very hard to compare entities because the methods each uses to compute their statistics varies between countries and time.<p>This can often be seen when people look at infant mortality rates (different by country), or the number of those in poverty (definition of poverty changes).  So the danger of this is that it requires a nuanced understanding of the data to actually get a fact based world view.",1237175989

But often that intuitive picture can't just be gifted to you, despite the best efforts of our best teachers to concoct the perfect metaphors. It takes time. You have to fiddle around with the concepts in your head, sometimes for <i>years</i>, before they really sink in. You might have to repeat them several times, or approach them from several angles, or encounter them in unusual surroundings, or find the one book that finally explains the subject in a way that clicks.<p>Once you <i>really</i> understand something, trying to remember what it was like <i>before</i> you understood it is like trying to forget how to read.",1237175921
517720,comment,517634,517715,0,0,wallflower,,,"The biggest difference between Twitter and Facebook updates (at the moment) is that your Facebook news feed is limited by who you have some connection to (albeit possibly very tenuous). The beauty (and ugliness) of Twitter is that it's interest or topic-based - you don't need a pre-existing connection to start following or viewing someone's public tweets.<p>That being said, I will be sad if Twitter is subsumed by Google or Facebook.<p>EDIT: Technically easy but Facebook is a good walled-garden (privacy controls). I don't know if they'll let some public weeds in just to compete with Twitter. Twitter allowing Facebook users to auto-post an update to their Twitter identity could work.",1237175917

While a new psyco would be nice, what really would make sense is a boost-like tophat on rpython so you can drop into it and compile your performance-critical routines.  Today people do that with C++ and boost.

Those people could be new friends at other startups, future talent for my company, future informal advisors, potential investors, or an awesome bartender at the Olde Pro in Palo Alto.

This is a set of trivia rather than any detailed analysis.<p><i>installation of apps can be confusing to people not familiar with macs</i><p>Either you run an installer, or you drag a file to Applications. Are you joking? That's actually one of the easiest things.<p><i>no reasonable way to uninstall software along with its data</i><p>Not built-in, no. Get AppCleaner, which is free and very reasonable.<p><i>disk volumes (dmg files) can be confusing to people not familiar with macs</i><p>Each family member of mine who's used a Mac figured this out instantly. They treat it like a plugged-in device, which is a really nifty way of simplifying a complex process.<p><i>not clear whether installing a virus checker and/or firewall is important to people not familiar with macs</i><p>It's not, which is why it's never talked about.<p><i>window management not as nice as win 7 although Exposé is very cool</i><p>Something like this doesn't give any information. Does Windows 7 attach its notifications physically to the generating window, sliding the window into view if the notification needs room? Something like that adds significantly to usability, and there are a lot of small window features like that.<p><i>strange that closing the last window of an app does not quit the app</i><p>The rule on the Mac is as follows: if there's a reason you'd keep the application open when the last window closes, it stays open. That way I can hear iTunes with the window closed (and without some crap about minimizing the window), or I can close a TextEdit window and immediately open a new on. iPhoto, meanwhile, closes instantly, because it's a single-window system.<p><i>pdf files are not shown in the browser window</i><p>Yes?

I wish there was a HN feature: custom filters, i.e. a regexp one could use to filter out irrelevant (to him/her) news: twitter, facebook, .+ionaire - all these would be in my filter: I'm an engineer and I'm not interested in media/entertainment/advertisement business, yet sometimes they occupy well over half of the front page. I assume this happens due to a widespread belief that building a media company is how a programmer can ""make it"" these days. Twitter, Walt Disney, Austin American Statesman or AutoTrader - there is no difference and all of them are of no interest to a programmer: they're not ""high-tech"" companies. Sure, they employ programmers and can't be run without computers, but that applies to <i>every business in 2009</i><p>Custom filtering would also allow me to see promising submissions  to bubble up to <i>my</i> start page, taking the spots of killed media/hype/iphone/getrich-with-3-lines-of-javascript stories.<p>I wanted to write such UI myself and just let it be - i.e. I'd crawl HN and generate my own front page but I suspect Paul wouldn't be happy about it.",1237174801

The magical UNIX terminal where you could get new functionality by piping pieces together into your own customized tool was hard to start with, but grew on me in a couple of months.  That was the point when I couldn't really go back -- Windows didn't run my favourite software -- the bash shell coupled with transparent mount-points for FIFO and tools like SSH, VIM and Python.  Yeah, I know Python runs on Windows.  It makes little ice-weasels cry, though.<p>And later on, my Wacom + Painter/Photoshop (I really hate Photoshop, I do) doodling hobby required too much effort to support with Linux.  As of late this has gotten better, including Linux apps for painting, but by then I was gone.<p>Then I sort of bought into some of the software specific to the platform, such as Panic's Coda, the iTunes on the Mac, and now I'm stuck here.

Its a disease that white people don't get, largely because we eliminated it in our countries prior to getting religion on that environmentalism thing.  After that, we collectively decided that while our kids were worth cracking a few eggs to make an omlette, African kids were not.<p>Take a look at this graph here, particularly the one in the top left corner:<p><a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/images/graphs/us_malaria_old_map.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/images/graphs/us_malaria_old_map....</a><p>That shaded land mass, 60% of the continental US?  That used to be Malaria Country.  In 2009, there isn't a spec of the US that is Malaria Country.  The reason: we bombed the shit out of the mosquitoes, pure and simple, and we kept doing it until malaria wasn't a problem anymore.  If there was a malaria flareup in a US suburb this year, we would do a bit of obligatory handwriting and then promptly bomb the shit out of it.<p>(You think we'd make white people put up with expensive, ineffective countermeasures like treated crib nets?  I'd like to hear that planning meeting: ""Well, we've run the numbers, and have decided that by spending a few million on bed nets, crib nets, and outdoor abatement programs, only about five of your kids, plus or minus three or so, will die in the next year due to malaria in our township.  Remember to be really conscientious about putting up your nets -- not that they're going to save everyone, because they can't, but remembering the nets every night gives your child the maximum chance of survival until the school year starts.  Why don't we just bomb the shit out of the bugs, you ask?  Oh, well, we considered doing that but are concerned the local birdwatchers will be upset."")<p>Over a million African children died last year of malaria.  Five hundred million people caught the disease.  But when it is Africans dying, and not us, then we get all sorts of picky about how much ecological damage is being done.<p>(Incidentally, not much.  But given the choice between 1 million Africans a year and Very Bad Environmental Things that presumably happened in the US between 1880 and 1950 when we were spraying DDT like it was going out of style, I think we have a moral imperative to choose Very Bad Environmental Things.)",1237174188

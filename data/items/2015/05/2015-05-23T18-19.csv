Why do you think so much of Warren Buffett&#x27;s &quot;charitable donations&quot; go to charities he created? They are tax shelters that are run by his kids.

9593900,comment,9591988,9592169,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"As a layman if I had to theorise how this can be... I&#x27;d say<p>- Shifting cultures. In 1900 humans all over the planet were relatively collectivistic. That&#x27;s moving towards individualistic societies. That means kids leaving homes sooner, getting married less, live in their own apartments despite having relationships. Partly that&#x27;s due to wealth (an enabler), but more so due to culture (the driving force). After all in some cultures we still see wealthy enough people who live with their parents (e.g. lots of Chinese middle class who can afford living individually).<p>This means that the square footage per person radically increases.<p>- Population growth which adds demographically driven pricing pressure<p>- Lure of cities. Cities have always been concentrated areas of population, but never more than today. In 1870 about 50% of people worked in agriculture (and you can correlate it with where they lived: where the farmland was, i.e. spread out all over the US). Today that figure is generally deemed less than 2% in most OECD countries, and urbanisation is huge, growing from 25% in 1870 to 80% today. It&#x27;s no surprise then that the value of these areas continues to skyrocket.<p>And that makes sense. Our value added isn&#x27;t from the land. It&#x27;s mostly in the services industry. (i.e. wheat costs 10 cents a pound, but a pound of cereal in nice packaging etc is 310 cents per pound). Crude example but this needs no explanation really.<p>Land prices being cheap elsewhere doesn&#x27;t factor in the insane economies of scale and existing infrastructure in cities. Want to build a new house on cheap ranch land, be prepared to build your own sewage, water, electric, satellite internet etc. In that sense overpriced city apartments may actually be considered cheapish sometimes.<p>- Existing landowners tend to have political power in the area where they own land (and often thereby the buildings, shops, industry etc on top of it). It&#x27;s in their interest to keep their land scarce, this increases the value of their land. So you now have people with power to keep something scarce, who have a reason to keep something scarce. Often this is pretty artificial, while some property owners oppose loosening restrictions for genuine non-financial reasons (e.g. I don&#x27;t want a skyscraper in my backyard), many land owners don&#x27;t really care for building limits if they increased their property prices, but because they usually don&#x27;t, they oppose them.<p>On the one hand it seems like a very safe bet: real estate. On the other, here&#x27;s what I wonder sometimes. Let&#x27;s take a 50-70 year view, right? We&#x27;re seeing pretty big leaps in sustainable energy and storage. (enables off the grid). We&#x27;re seeing big leaps in information networks and coverage. (enables off the grid). We&#x27;re seeing new generations growing up with ideals of authenticity, renewed mainstream appreciation for hiking, community based tourism, community supported agriculture etc. And finally we&#x27;re seeing very interesting movements in VR and AR to the extent that working from home etc can get standardised into a human (read: not skype convos) experience closer to regular cooperation in an office. With housing prices growing faster than income, there has to come a point where, say in 20 years from now, a cheap, less urban location, enabled by new technology (less reliant on the grid, able to be very productive using VR/AR) etc will be much more appealing than living downtown in a $1m closet.<p>These are some extremely unsophisticated thoughts, of course, quickly written up as a layman in these technologies, real estate and sociological trends. Just want to put them out there to think about. I wonder if housing prices will be as safe a bet the next 50 years as they were the last 50.",1432407097

This looks like a funnel centered around the true value. The funnel is wide where N is small and narrow where N is large. Two conclusions from the figure:<p>1. The true elasticity is ~0 (maybe ever so slightly negative). Only small increases in minimum wage were studied, so this isn&#x27;t an argument in favor of drastic raises, just an argument that small raises don&#x27;t hurt under prevailing conditions.<p>2. The funnel should be symmetrical because random error does not favor higher vs lower elasticity. Instead, the funnel is bent, which is evidence of strong publication bias in favor of results of the form &quot;increases in minimum wage decrease the number of jobs.&quot;<p>FWIW I don&#x27;t think minimum wage increases are a great way out of this mess because I think reduced workweek and basic income / minimum income / EITC are all better options.

There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And an outstanding reason for choosing some sort of God or spiritual-type thing to worship — be it J.C. or Allah, be it Yahweh or the Wiccan mother-goddess or the Four Noble Truths or some infrangible set of ethical principles — is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things — if they are where you tap real meaning in life — then you will never have enough. Never feel you have enough. It&#x27;s the truth. Worship your own body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly, and when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally plant you. On one level, we all know this stuff already — it&#x27;s been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, bromides, epigrams, parables: the skeleton of every great story. The trick is keeping the truth up-front in daily consciousness. Worship power — you will feel weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to keep the fear at bay. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart — you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. And so on.<p>Look, the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they&#x27;re evil or sinful; it is that they are unconscious. They are default-settings. They&#x27;re the kind of worship you just gradually slip into, day after day, getting more and more selective about what you see and how you measure value without ever being fully aware that that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re doing. And the world will not discourage you from operating on your default-settings, because the world of men and money and power hums along quite nicely on the fuel of fear and contempt and frustration and craving and the worship of self. Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom. The freedom to be lords of our own tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the center of all creation. This kind of freedom has much to recommend it. But of course there are all different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most precious you will not hear much talked about in the great outside world of winning and achieving and displaying. The really important kind of freedom involves attention, and awareness, and discipline, and effort, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them, over and over, in myriad petty little unsexy ways, every day. That is real freedom. The alternative is unconsciousness, the default-setting, the “rat race” — the constant gnawing sense of having had and lost some infinite thing.&quot;</i>",1432404316

I was an early employee in a turnkey software startup built on ideas from a moderately noted researcher in the field the software was designed to sell to. I had known the researcher off and on over the years and he had been brought on as the CTO with the investors bringing in an outside person they knew as the CEO.<p>They were still in &quot;stealth mode&quot; at this time, taking some earlier work the researcher had spent time on and hardening it for general commercial sale. This was the first red flag I should have seen, instead of taking the time to reboot the product and start it over for a modern market, the development team was spending a year doing bug fixes and cleaning up broken research code.<p>Not long after starting I went with the CTO to a trade show for market research and meet and greets with some industry partners. He booked us a lavish 4-star hotel and during a week-long trip maybe spent 2 hours at the show. He couldn&#x27;t get out of there fast enough and instead wanted to rent a conference room outside the city and spend the week brainstorming product ideas. Remember, he had directed the dev team to not develop a new product but to merely fix and update his old code. He then described some new ideas that I recognized as being more or less exactly like a competing product. I asked him to describe how we would differentiate it from that product. Instead he claimed it was a totally different idea. Red flags #2, #3 and 4<p>And it went on a for a while, intense conflicts between the CTO and the dev manager put development work into a holding pattern, lack of a good sales strategy, and so on.<p>Eventually there was complete turnover at the C-level and the investors brought in a new team, they asked me to stay on while they rebooted the company so I did, and we did better, almost turned it around. But by that time we were stuck with a huge legacy codebase dwindling investment dollars and a host of other problems that we could never seem to shake.<p>Despite being a bad experience, I learned more from that failed company than I&#x27;ve learned in the other 15 years of work. Observing so many failure modes happening all at once, and seeing how a pro-team might go about a turn-around has taught me an entire business school&#x27;s worth of street smarts.<p>I&#x27;d almost recommend riding a company down like that to people serious about startups so they can learn the same things, but to be honest, I wouldn&#x27;t wish it on my worst enemy.",1432404197

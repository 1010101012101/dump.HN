In particular, you don't have to do exact instruction selection, instruction scheduling, register allocation (LLVM IR has infinite ""registers"") and memory allocation when compiling. The LLVM backend is very good at making these decisions and writing a compiler that is better than the LLVM backend would be years of work.<p>LLVM IR is also machine independent so you can write just one compiler front end that emits LLVM IR and compile that to machine code of many different CPUs. You can even distribute the LLVM IR bitcode and use the LLVM JIT compiler to assemble machine code at run time when you know exactly what the target architecture is and have optimized code just for that platform (CPU instruction set extensions, like SSE, NEON and other SIMD extensions, etc).<p>In summary, LLVM IR is a lot easier to generate than machine code and the LLVM backend will emit better machine code than a hand built backend (unless you have years to spend on it).",1353843382

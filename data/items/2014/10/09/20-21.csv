If that&#x27;s your only true point, then there&#x27;s little argument to be had other than a subjective nature of what I consider primary. If your argument extends past that, about the term &quot;Constitutional right&quot; itself, then, again, you&#x27;d be wrong to imply that &quot;rights and rules&quot; derived from Constitutional interpretation aren&#x27;t Constitutional rights. That&#x27;s not judicial wordplay. It&#x27;s common language.<p>Example:<p>----------------------------<p>&quot;What to Say to Invoke the Right to Silence<p>The new Supreme Court decision raises weighty questions, such as whether it’s reasonable to place the onus of asserting constitutional rights on everyday people, most of whom have never cracked the spine of a criminal procedure or constitutional law book. The more practical question is what, exactly, an out-of-custody person must say to inquisitive police officers in order to claim the right to silence. To be safe, they should make clear that they are invoking their Fifth Amendment right to silence and have nothing further to say. That way their subsequent failure to answer any questions cannot be mentioned at trial.&quot;<p>by: Micah Schwartzbach<p><a href=""http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/when-how-invoke-your-right-silence.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/when-how-invoke-your-...</a><p>----------------------------<p>This writer uses the term <i>&quot;constitutional rights&quot;</i> in context. He later says, <i>&quot;...invoking their Fifth Amendment right to silence...&quot;</i> (i.e. &quot;... invoking their Constitutional right to silence...&quot;) in direct context. I won&#x27;t dig up numerous other examples from lawyers who write about this subject in-depth. Court rulings continually change the landscape of rights. They change what&#x27;s inherently so-called &quot;Constitutional&quot; at any point in time. Many issues become topics of people&#x27;s Constitutional rights once they&#x27;re challenged on the basis of the Constitution. This is irrespective of a changing landscape&#x27;s rulings at any point in time.<p>Outside of that language, we may agree more than we disagree.",1412887972

Google operates on the basis that the network is cheap (RIP Sun, &quot;The network is the computer&quot;), and that it can economize by providing functionality at the data center.<p>I&#x27;d argue that Google reflects a more modern way of thinking, and that Apple&#x27;s approach is somewhat anachronistic. However, as far as surveillance goes, Apple is perhaps at an advantage. All things equal, it&#x27;s easier to attack a few datacenters than to individually attack millions of reasonably secure endpoints.<p>This is doubly true when we consider business models of the two companies. In order for Google to monetize your information, it needs to <i>see</i> your information in some sense. That makes Apple&#x27;s business model of mostly doing cost recovery through device sales even more beneficial in a surveillance-averse world.<p>EDIT 2: If Apple wanted to be proactive about divesting Google from some of its monetizable data collection, it would extend something like iMessage encryption to Apple users on Gmail. Send email from Apple&#x27;s client to another iDevice user over gmail? Give them the option of encrypting it. Don&#x27;t let Google peek in.",1412887342

We did quit our jobs, worked hard on the product and yet... we never finished it. Too much distracted (we started developping several products at once), too much basic errors (leaving jobs too soon), not enough dev experience etc, long story.<p>To answer your question - you get back to normal job. I had 0 problems to find a job thanks to the reputation / experience I have acquired before. Also people do care, but in a positive way - yes you failed, but at least you have tried ! I frankly don&#x27;t know any smart, hard working guy in the corporate jobs that isn&#x27;t dreaming about launching his own stuff. It&#x27;s just that most are too affraid to fail and / or give up the easy life for some months or years.<p>I was a bit surprised too by this positive attitude, especially that I&#x27;m living in France where the culture of failure is not exactly the same as it seems to be in the US.

Then you could follow up with them en masse to fill in their shipping address before you&#x27;re ready to ship. This is a self-service feature <a href=""https://dashboard.trycelery.com/status"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dashboard.trycelery.com/status</a> and the credential parameters can be pre-formed so convenient links can be dynamically created for each customer to take them right to the correct spot.<p>Once a customer has paid for something, the conversion of them coming back to fill in shipping address to receive it is very high.<p>>how many backers do you lose by not obtaining actual shipping details upfront?<p>Bravo. Not many people think of the flow so holistically, even though they should. On one hand, reducing inputs and simplifying checkout can give conversion rates a lift. On the other hand, unfamiliar UX can trip some customers up too. Also it can end up driving more support questions for sellers. eg, &quot;When do I give you my shipping address?

Rather than make a new submission, I&#x27;ll mention here another article about the same find that I saw today and liked.[1] For background information about what we knew about paleolithic art before these latest discoveries, I strongly recommend I recommend <i>The Nature of Paleolithic Art</i>[2] by R. Dale Guthrie, a book I enjoyed reading several years ago. Guthrie is a field biologist and very competent visual artist who specializes in Pleistocene megafauna like mammoths. He went to most of the oldest sites of surviving cave art--although, not as far as I know, to the one now described in today&#x27;s news in Indonesia--and personally looked at ancient drawings on site as he studied examples of early art for his book. His book shows hand stencil blowpaint drawings and depictions of prey animals much like those in the articles in the news today. He devotes pages of thoughtful discussion to what early human drawings show and what drawing problems early artists encountered. He even mentions interesting evidence like figuring out how old the painters were by how high up on cave walls the paintings are found--it&#x27;s clear that little kids in olden days practiced by making crude drawings, and became better at drawing as they grew up and could reach higher.<p>[1] &quot;World&#x27;s oldest art found in Indonesian cave&quot; <a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/world-s-oldest-art-found-in-indonesian-cave-1.16100"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/news/world-s-oldest-art-found-in-indon...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Nature-Paleolithic-Dale-Guthrie/dp/0226311260"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Nature-Paleolithic-Dale-Guthrie/dp...</a>",1412885514

8434715,comment,8427852,8432816,0,0,saurik,,,"My issue is not performance: I believe that you will have more coding errors due to the <i>semantic</i> error inherent in the variable being initialized twice. In some languages... in many languages... this is in fact impossible to even type, and the arguments why are due to semantics, not performance.<p>If it makes you feel better, move this code to a function that returns a single value and initialize the variable once in one place (and then mark e value const!). I actually also agree this is a better option, but semantically the if/else is clearer than the if/default, so I would not fall back to if/default over if/else.<p>As for relying on the compiler: turn that warning on manually and turn that warning into an error manually. (Do not turn all warnings on, as upgrading your compiler can break your build, but turn on warnings that you actively want to verify your code against and have cleared your code against (including this one.)<p>I will also argue that you should treat your static analysis similar to a dynamic unit test on your code: it doesn&#x27;t matter if some people are using a compiler that doesn&#x27;t have this feature (though that seems unlikely as I believe all major compilers support this feature) as the maintainer will, in the same sense that running unit tests sometimes requires more dependencies than running the underlying code.<p>Again, though, if you are very used to the if/default control flow, I can appreciate wanting to use it: I just would rather see people take advantage of static language analysis that is present to deal with silly errors, and then arrange their code to better handle high-level logic errors.",1412884844

I&#x27;ve been thinking about using a thermoelectric generator in my off-grid cabin to make up for the lack of solar in the winter. Up here in Yukon the wood stove is burning 24x7 from October to March, and you can guarantee it&#x27;s not above -10C (often -30C) outside.<p>I&#x27;m thinking of mounting a bunch of them near the stove for the hot side, then running a radiator outside for the cool side. I don&#x27;t think it will be too hard to get a temperature difference of a few hundred degrees C. Hopefully this new material will come good on it&#x27;s 5-10% efficiency.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/news/528841/thermoelectric-material-to-hit-market-later-this-year/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.technologyreview.com/news/528841/thermoelectric-m...</a>",1412884812

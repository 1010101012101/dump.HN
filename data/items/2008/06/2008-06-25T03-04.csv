The idea that a squishy, irrational bit of human behaviour could affect the cold, clean and rational world of markets was a challenge to neoclassical economists. Their assumption had always been that individuals act to maximise their welfare (the defining characteristic of economic man, or Homo economicus).</i><p>I see this kind of thing over and over again, but I don't believe it.<p>What I don't believe is that anyone really ever thought that Homo Economicus was <i>really</i> the way that humans behave, rather than a massive simplification of the spherical-cow variety aimed at making economics tractable.<p>To a first approximation, people will act to maximise their own benefit. To a second approximation, they're blithering idiots.",1214366376

So there's basically no need for them to improve it -> low priority.<p>Don't fix what's ain't broken (what's sort of working) approach.",1214366175
227145,story,,,1,2,shadowen77,"Ask YC: Recommend a good Managed Host",,"We are Coders not System Admins, and all we need is a basic PHP/Apache/Sendmail server. We went with a Fully Managed VPS, because we figured it was worth the extra dough for the Managed option so an expert Admin could do the initial setup and most importantly fix things when they break.<p>We went with Acunett's Managed VPS based on recommendations from WebHostingTalk. Unfortunately, their service can be agonizingly slow at times ( > 48 hours for simple issues), and they have a frustrating habit of fixing things without telling us:  a) why X suddenly went down after months of uptime, and b) what they're going to do to prevent X from occurring again.<p>We're in Alpha now but I cannot imagine having to put up with this poor response-time with paying customers. Surely there's a way to get better service than this without hiring our own sysadmin? Any advice or recommendations?",1214366058

227136,comment,227045,227125,0,0,rms,,,"OK -- I spec'd a Dell XPS M150 just now to be equivalent to the $2500 Macbook Pro. I got a better than equivalent config for $1678 -- it has 4GB of RAM, would be $1578 with 2GB of RAM.<p>It comes with a built-in 2MP webcam and bluetooth and N-wireless. It has HDMI rather than DVI out. A bluray burner is an option, as is a 1920x1080 screen. The only thing it is missing is firewire and I don't think anyone can argue that Firefire is worth $900, except people that need Firewire. The backlit keyboard is nice and generally indicative of the Apple touch, I guess, but that adds $900.<p>At one point, it was definitely true that you couldn't get a laptop with all the extras in a Mac. But this Dell Computer really seems equivalent. Perhaps not in build quality.",1214365236

In most of the world, ""lining your pockets"" is a necessary precondition for things like ""eating"" and ""paying rent"".<p>Perhaps you need to get a job in a factory. (Not that this is always an easy thing to do, in the 21st-century USA.) I used to work in a factory, as part of an engineering team that was desperately trying to get a brand-new class of product to market. We were acutely aware that, if our product turned out to be unmanufacturable, everyone in our division -- from the local senior management to the hundreds of hard-working blue-collar folks who ran, fixed, and cleaned the equipment on the night shift -- was at risk of being laid off. In fact, just to inspire us, many of the folks at our local site got laid off anyway, thanks to the dotcom bust and the resulting slump in telecom.<p>I'm proud of the software I wrote for <i>that</i> project. Not because it was particularly elegant -- which it was not -- but because it helped keep the fabs alive, the products alive, the company alive, and hundreds of American and Malaysian workers alive.",1214364026

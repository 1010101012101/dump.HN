4403426,comment,4400324,4400999,1,0,smsm42,,,">> Your saying that we can't copy other countries because they're different, yet we can't copy ourselves because it doesn't scale well.<p>Right. That's why mere <i>copying</i> of anything won't work. One has to actually put some thought into how to make it work without just copying something. I know, it's a bummer, but when we spend trillions of dollars on federal government, we can expect them to have at least couple of people who can think and do beyond what an average copying machine does.<p>>>  Have you ever watched Fox News for more than 5 minutes? They would slander the hell out of ANY politician who said ""let's be like France""<p>I'd recommend to leave aside the knee-jerk Fox News bashing, it does not add anything to the topic. I'd also recommend to actually read my response, where I specifically say that nobody would say ""let's be like France"" - but many politicians can and do say ""let's borrow this good idea from France"". France being substitute for many various countries here of course.<p>>> Note - It's important to understand that neither I nor yourself need to watch Fox News. The point is, a VERY LARGE portion of America does, and they believe the stuff that spews out of these people's mouths.<p>I strongly suspect your information about ""stuff that spews out of these people's mouths"" is a a distorted third-party reports and not the result of actual observation of sufficient footage and comparing it to other comparable networks and hosts - such as MSNBC, for example. FN is no better and no worse than any other major news outlet - they all are politicized and all employ some people which have very strong opinions, earn millions by voicing these opinions to the public and sometimes do not let the actual facts to stand in the way of these opinions. This however is not related too much to the topic in question, as existence of politicians that openly declare views which go directly opposite to what most of the FN viewers would agree with is the fact, be these opinions regarding health care, finances, social issues, judiciary issues or any issues whatsoever. FN or their viewers do not hold any death grip on America and are only one part of various and pluralistic public scene. They have their options, other people have theirs, and all of them ""spew"" them from their mouths freely. It may cause some people stop voting for some politicians, and some other people start voting for them - that's how the elections work. But assuming politicians live in mortal fear of FN and that prevents them from telling what they want to tell people is pure nonsense.<p>>> I think the overall point of the article is that we are effectively ""trapped"" in the US because we are constantly reminded that ""This is the America Way!"" and to think otherwise is blasphemy.<p>This is baloney. There is no agreement what is ""America Way"", and right now there are at least two, if not more, polar opposite approaches as to what is ""America Way"" in pretty much every issue are being actively discussed in public, with roughly equal parts of the population sympathizing to each approach. In this situation, claiming there's only one ""America Way"" and departing from it is seen by the public as blasphemy is to confess your own ignorance and detachment from most current events easily observable.",1345359216

It's (unsurprisingly) false, or at least challenged by independent science.<p>A study was released late last year by the National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) [1] which found that a switch to natural gas would increase warming over the next few decades, as outlined in NCAR's report [2].<p>It acknowledges something the shale gas industry studiously avoids in calculating figures for its green credentials pitches: fugitive emissions. A significant amount of methane leakage occurs in the fracking process and piping of gases.<p>When you add in the input-intensive activity of multiple well constructions, fracking, pipeline construction, and fugitive emissions the 'green' story of shale gas doesn't add up.<p>There was a piece recently on another atmospheric scientist coming to the same conclusion. She uncovered significant underestimation of fugitive emissions of methane (speculating that it is at least double the official figures) and concluded that they are also underestimating release of other chemicals.

Summer's remarks were widely misinterpreted and led to his resignation from Harvard, but his point was simple and has been made by many: there is a theory that both genders have exactly the same mean I.Q., but for evolutionary reasons men's sigma (standard deviation) is wider -- meaning men are more likely to be outliers than women, both smarter and dumber.

I feel a lot safer in California than I ever did when I was living in New Zealand.<p>2) A bit of a backwater - so far from anything, very socially isolated, living in a small pond basically.<p>3) A negative/tall-poppy attitude.

4403364,comment,4403086,4403086,1,0,MrKurtHaeusler,,,"Good post. For me the first 3 tips, about having management backing, the right culture and the right people made me smile a bit. An analogy would be like ""Here are 3 tips for being successful in business: Have a lot of capital, have a great idea, and execute it perfectly"".<p>Normally getting management backing, developing the right culture, and having the right people are huge, difficult topics in themselves that are much larger and more fundamental than how a team decides to develop software.<p>If anything it goes the other way around. In order to get management support the team should first start doing agile and proving that it works. Having the right culture is a long term thing. Agile software development is a mere step in that direction as far as developing software goes. If anything agile software development helps the right culture emerge rather than the right culture being a prerequisite for agile software development.<p>And if you truly have the right people you don't need to to worry about agile, you are already doing so well that agile will only slow you down. Agile is probably ideal for larger organisations who unfortunately don't have the ""right"" people and need a framework or something to help them along. Once people get competent enough, ""agile"" just starts to feel dogmatic and restrictive. I mean they will still do the practices that make sense, but they aren't going to appreciate other aspects of buying into a whole ""agile"" approach.<p>I would also caution against ""passing the change baton to higher ups"". I have seen all the hard work undone when a fairly agile software development department decided to combine with the product department and include them in the change management process. The idea was to spread agility outwards, but because the product department had mostly more extroverted, managerial types they took control of the decision making (I was surprised how easily the software developers ceded control and retreated into a yes boss mentality) and their command and control culture swamped over any agility we had in the dev department.",1345356192

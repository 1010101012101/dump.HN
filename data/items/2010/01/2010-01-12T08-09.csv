1047155,comment,1047042,1047042,0,0,jacquesm,,,"It's good to know they exist, they'll probably be aware that you exist sooner or later as well.<p>It's a big world!<p>There is more than room enough for two, three or 50 companies doing what you're doing, the market is more than large enough for that, especially if you look overseas as well.<p>A three year headstart is <i>your</i> advantage. After all, you get the benefit of their three years of product development without having to go the long way round. Check out what they've got and learn from it.<p>Stick to your plan, observe them like a hawk and make sure that you give your customers excellent service. They won't go looking for a competitor until you mess up.<p>Don't worry so much about keyword rankings, a solid business does not solely depend on search engines for its traffic. And there is always advertising if you want to go and acquire new customers in a higher volume.<p>As for going 'niche' that might be a great strategy to stay under their radar until you've been able to level the playing field and you have a bigger war chest.<p>But in the long run their existence shouldn't matter much, it's not like you're going to go head to head with microsoft or google on operating systems or search.<p>It's just another company, they come and go. Likely there are other competitors out there that you haven't picked up on yet.<p>In a market with no competition, anybody can be 'top dog'. Such markets are illusions, any way that you find to make a living someone else will come and see you and think 'hey, nice idea'. Some of them will be better, some of them will be worse. There is no hard and fast rule that says that the first mover will be the one to win the game.<p>The there is the subject of locality. If you are going to address the 'self employed' market then there are so many options so 'slice' that market that if you make it easy to adapt your product to a niche that you could also address many of these niches in parallel, effectively you are still 'broad' but you now have a unique advantage for each of those little sub markets.<p>Which should remedy some of your keyword worries, since it is much easier to rank high for combinations of keywords than that it is to rank high for individual keywords.<p>good luck!",1263286397

It's not incontrovertibly clear that the down-arrow isn't for disagreement -- ""it's a vote, and I'm supposed to vote my opinion, right?"" --  so it's an attractive nuisance, and some percentage of users will use it for lazy-disagreement as long as it's there.<p>I think the most effective remedy would be to provide another equally-easy one-click-disagree -- separate from karma-downvote -- that doesn't imply a community demotion/sanction.

My retort was that colleges are incredibly diverse, and enable many conversations and experiences that simply wouldn’t all happen in any other single place, and the best you can do is to tell me that people are still interesting after they graduate?<p>I’m sorry, but the constitutional law scholar, the electrical engineer, the chamber singer, the neurobiology review editor, the congressional staffer, the south asian dancer, the ancient babylonian historian, the photographer, and the basketball player aren’t going to all be sitting at lunch talking about the lecture they just listened to about Kant with their venerable philosophy professor in any job I’ve ever heard of.<p>Yes, there are interesting people everywhere (in the supermarket, for instance, or at a rock concert or hiking through a national park). That doesn’t mean that the college experience can be easily replaced anywhere else I can think of. Which is not to suggest that college is essential, but only that it has value beyond certification or specific curricula.<p>> <i>... they're more fun to deal with once their goal changes from ""Continue getting financial aid / parental aid"" to ""Do something that pays well.""</i><p>Both of those sound like awfully boring goals.

1047137,comment,1047117,1047117,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Honestly, I'd start with Scheme, because it's a small language and will teach you the basics of Lisp-like languages.  Once you understand closures, and macros, and continuations, and data abstraction in Lisp-like languages, and how you can build just about anything out of these building blocks, <i>then</i> you can learn the more advanced stuff that Clojure or Common Lisp has.<p>For implementations, I'd probably start with PLT Scheme for learning.  It's fairly complete and easy to get up and running with.  Some other implementations are faster (Stalin), and some may have more practical libraries (Bigloo, though that's debatable), and some may have more interesting implementations (Chicken), but PLT's a fairly well-rounded early choice.

For starters almost everyone else is using multi-touch, and from what I understand (I haven't any dev experience with Android) multi-touch support is built into the OS, just that the default apps don't use it",1263283282

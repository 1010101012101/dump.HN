2809,comment,2757,2797,0,0,JMiao,,,"Well, what I mean to say is that the number of meetups is simply dependent on those interested.  YC News gatherings shouldn't ultimately be restricted to Startup School weekend.<p>I figured that it would be great if YC News goers in the Palo Alto area get together since we're probably sitting in the same neighborhood.<p>Ideally, it would be awesome if YC News communities got together with peers in their immediate locales.  Know what I mean?",1173326256

We ended up getting a huge number of applications (1181 for 650 places), and it's taking us longer than we anticipated to read them all. So we're not going to be able to reply to everyone March 7, as we initially promised, but we will try to do it by the end of March 8.",1173325934
2806,comment,2786,2786,0,0,r0b,,,"There are certainly a lot of ways to monetize MySpace beyond ad revenue, and using it as a music distribution channel is one of the easiest.  (maybe News Corp. should buy Amie Street, and integrate it into myspace?)<p>But shouldn't they start by doing a better job capitalizing on the advertising potential?  Theoretically, MySpace should know a massive amount of information about each user (everything they list on their profile page), including location, age, interests, media consumption patterns, etc.  They could be selling very highly-targeted ads based on all of those parameters.  Wouldn't it be more lucrative NOT to sell a graphical ad on the homepage at a daily rate of $250,000 (as the post reports), but instead to make the homepage ad dynamically tailored to each user?

RedHat 4.2. The drop that filled the glass last week (using a nightly compose) was the new gnome3 behavior when coming back from turned off monitor to save power.

5992393,comment,5990864,5990864,5,0,tete,,,"I can so much agree. I pretty much went that way and a lot of it is true and I wished I had done that earlier. Also I would recommend everyone to go this way, because it makes some problems easier to solve for you, even if you stay a sysadmin.<p>Other than that, I really wasn&#x27;t a good sysadmin, actually I used to be a really bad sysadmin, but still came from that direction. This however brings me to another thing: Sysadmins aren&#x27;t ever valued enough.<p>Everyone treats Sysadmins as second class IT people that can&#x27;t code too well. However, that&#x27;s from my point of view not true at all. They usually code &quot;script&quot; way faster. Their set of tools simply are different and designed for people trying to reach different goals.<p>But there is more to this. As a programmer, you have your cozy, nice environment, your nice specifications, your nice libraries, your basic knowledge of data structures, etc and you have an easy way to be like &quot;uh you can do it that way. It&#x27;s even cooler&quot;.<p>As a sysadmin you usually don&#x27;t have anything to rely at all. You don&#x27;t learn too much at universities, that can be of help and while as a software developer you basically have to just write code and make that work as a sysadmin you are dealing with unpredictable systems, have maybe a single system with multiple users, need to make sure none of these processes do something bad, yet can do everything they may need to do, need to trace down an error that is <i>somewhere</i>, don&#x27;t have a debugger, can&#x27;t just quickly run the code on your test system, have a way harder time to trace things down, but then it doesn&#x27;t have to be the one system, but could be a whole network of such systems, the whole internet can be the source and you are pretty much always in the battle field, in live systems and lots of attackers could potentially attack every single thing and you basically need to know every protocol, and every piece of software, every network connection and by heart. It could be something very high level causing the problem, a faulty program, the hardware, physics, whatever and you have to try to master chaos every single day, while programmers usually just work with something simple and often see it as a super hard problem when they are dealing with some input from the outside.<p>I don&#x27;t know, but it feels weird, when the bigger amount of math basically causes your pay to be higher, when that very thing is actually making your job easier.<p>I am a programmer myself. I love coding. I love my job and I kinda like to brag a bit with it, but actually compared to many other jobs, like sysadmins we are really overpayed, while way too often complain about bad sysadmins. Being a sysadmin isn&#x27;t just &quot;apt-get install apache&quot;, but way more and way intense.<p>Another thing that&#x27;s also funny and strange is that scripting thing. The same thing that often causes sysadmin to start out with ugly code is the thing that makes sysadmin advance extremely quickly when it comes to code quality. Once they really are programmers they know that a lot of code can be complex and since they have skills in using many tools and not just use them, but use them correctly (unlike most programmers tend to) they will usually turn out to write high quality (less bug prone) code with the right amount of defensiveness and in a way that brings some kind of order into chaos.<p>It&#x27;s a hard way, but sysadmins are maybe a bit too much perfectionists to realize that they would be good programmers and that hardly is recognized by people starting out as programmers, who would make really, really awful sysadmins btw. and no just because you set up a unix system and a firewall it doesn&#x27;t make you a sysadmin.<p>I actually even think that the devop thing is going partly into a wrong direction. It works, but only if you are using Ubuntu. No, really. That&#x27;s also not a good thing in general, because it could actually push IT backwards. Diversity is sadly not valued enough. Using the right tool can really push you forward. And while we often seek for tools used by most people it ultimately leads to stalling. Going into a direction where we have Ubuntu instead of many Linux distributions, many Unices, many Operating Systems isn&#x27;t good. There are reasons for the creation of more than one and they didn&#x27;t use to be as naive as they frequently are today.<p>Also Sysamdins are very humble. One can actually see that by version numbers. It&#x27;s maybe a bit silly of an example, but they (and programmers working with them) are extremely conservative about making a version sound like it could be stable. If they try their hard to find anything to change or make better and really can&#x27;t think of anything then they will maybe call it 0.9 Alpha. On the other hand, if they find something that is called 12.13.4.0 then the zero at the end makes them really suspicious about the software being too unstable (there is enough chaos already). If you know such software then it is probably written by a person somehow related to sysadmin stuff.<p>However, there is one thing that would make Sysadmins really great programmers: They are super pragmatic. They ahave a good sense of realism. They know what&#x27;s necessary and what isn&#x27;t, as long as they are not afraid of being punished for non-perfect/beautiful code. That means that they are good at writing release-ready (feature-/stability wise) code.<p>However none of that is true for anyone who just switched. It&#x27;s just hard to learn what the right amount of quality really is and that it also is about &quot;beautiful code&quot;.<p>Well, so much about my experience. If you know a sysadmin that likes to code, maybe help him and be nice. They are always complained about when something doesn&#x27;t work (even when it isn&#x27;t their fault) and whenever something works great it is the developers, marking people and so on who are praised.",1372971282

It&#x27;s like... if you think of it like water: If you have all your water at the top of a cliff in a big reservoir and it runs down into a turbine linked up to a generator, then you can get a lot of work out of that water. But once it&#x27;s gone down the cliff, despite it still being the same mass of water, your ability to extract useful work from that water is dramatically less. You&#x27;d have to pump it back to the top of the cliff to repeat the exercise (at a loss since the system you&#x27;re playing with is never going to be perfectly efficient, i.e. the second law of thermodynamics - so there&#x27;d basically be no point in doing so.)<p>What we really want are high concentrations of energy; low entropy sources. We&#x27;re looking for those situations where the water is still at the top of the cliff. A star is fussing down through the various elements, and in the process it emits a lot of radiation during its lifetime. And it&#x27;s not getting that energy back. Once the elements have undergone the process you&#x27;d have to put energy back into them to return them to their earlier states. But that energy&#x27;s been leaving the star for years, and some of it travels at the speed of light so it&#x27;s very far away - so... it&#x27;s just not gonna happen.

Or is Facebook just better at marketing?<p>When my Mom wanted to get on to Facebook there was definitely a learning curve. She had to be shown by my sister and myself how to do everything... sign up, post photos, learn about what a &quot;comment&quot; was, how to add people, manage things... Facebook is quite a complex piece of software. I don&#x27;t necessarily think that Facebook requires less technical skills than decentralized services.<p>In my opinion, the reason Facebook is popular across all demographics is because it is based on real identities. Real names, real faces. Before Facebook the Internet fully embraced anonymity and this requirement to partake in role playing, having an avatar that was separate from yourself, was confusing and a little bit terrifying to older people. My mom would always wonder WHO I was talking to on the Internet. They could have been a murderer, or a kidnapper! If you can&#x27;t see their face or know their name, she thought, how could they be trusted? My parents are NOT on Twitter and will probably never be for similar reasons. It is too weird for them to think about having a separate personality. They weren&#x27;t stage actors or used to the public eye because they were raised in a very different media environment. The distributed Internet turns us all in to celebrities. Facebook keeps things the way they were but allows people to benefit from the same abilities to publish, just to a seemingly private group of close friends and family.<p>Facebook, in my opinion, is a nice little service to hold your hand while introducing you to this very different new world that is emerging.<p>On the topic of marketing and technology... I&#x27;m just going to use Sun and Java as an example because I was recently talking about this and it&#x27;s fresh on my mind. Sun did an amazing job of marketing Java on the Internet. In the mid 90s every other web page had that little Java mascot on it. They took the Internet and ran with it, big time. There were much better and much easier tools around but their creators didn&#x27;t do enough to evangelize their benefits. You gotta get out there and sell this stuff to people.<p>It took open source software a LONG time to realize this. Products will wither and die without proper marketing and advertising, no matter how much better they are.<p>&quot;Great marketing and decent technology gives you a better bandwagon than great technology and decent marketing&quot;, as said by Ralph Johnson at <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JavaVsSmalltalk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JavaVsSmalltalk</a> - which BTW, is a great little wiki full of interesting conversations from a bunch of old timers and academics.",1372970214

The people that will take you up on an offer like this are disproportionately likely to fail; the ones that succeed are likely to regret having given up equity to a nights-and-weekends contractor.

I know that, for most people here, this is very strange: who would choose to avoid the exciting world of programming having the skills to do so? But indeed, it happens.<p>For someone that likes to solve problems, 95% of software development is mind-boggingly boring. It&#x27;s mostly looking at the same codebase day-in and day-out, while having to deal with shifting requirements. All of this to end up with some application that you mostly wouldn&#x27;t use yourself. This, if you&#x27;re lucky that your project doesn&#x27;t get cancelled before it sees the light of day, or it doesn&#x27;t get delayed so much that you get so bored that you move on before seeing it to completion.<p>And the consultancy... Parachuting into projects at clients and being extracted by helicopter when &quot;it&#x27;s done&quot; (which is usually when it meets minimum requirements to receive payment, not when it is at all in a state to be proud of).<p>Really, 95% of software development isn&#x27;t glamorous stuff at NASA or the next big social network(1).<p>Systems administration, provided you are self-motivated, can actually code your way out of a hole, and are willing to deal with the occasional user, provides plenty of space to solve problems with programming. With <i>programming</i>, not IDE and framework juggling.<p>Sure, it can be boring at times and can be stressful at others, and you have 95% chance of being in the exact same environment where you wouldn&#x27;t like to be coding in. But at least you have more autonomy and can actually <i>solve</i> problems.<p>I&#x27;m a programmer by training and a systems administrator by profession. I would most likely rather be programming than taking care of systems and databases, but only if I found something in those remaining 5% that I would actually enjoy doing.<p>Otherwise, it would just burn me out from programming altogether, and I like programming...<p>(1) Actually, developing the next big social network is probably as boring as everything else I said.

Of course you can license it under whatever you want, it&#x27;s your code, but you need to understand the consequences. If the library is GPL it can only be used by other GPL applications (if the application is distributed), which excludes major open source projects like Rails (MIT) and Django (BSD). It seriously limits amount of people that can use your library, and hopefully you are open sourcing a library because you want to help as many people as possible.<p>Even the LGPL doesn&#x27;t make sense for interpreted languages or compiled languages that don&#x27;t link like C. The wording of the LGPL is pretty ambiguous when it comes to languages that &#x27;include&#x27; libraries into their code instead of linking against complied libraries. FSF argues it&#x27;s not ambiguous [1], but that fact that they even have to make that argument proves it is.

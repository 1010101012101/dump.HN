She has paid to co-locate her server at the exchange, and she has paid to use high-speed connections between exchanges. Are we going to declare that paying for a competitive advantage is suddenly immoral?</i><p>Here&#x27;s the problem with that: the number of available ultra-close connections to the market is finite.  If you carry this out to its only possible conclusion, whomever has the closest connection always wins, and everyone else always loses.  The other market participants eventually realize that it is simply not possible for them to win, and that a closer connection is not for sale at any price, so they simply stop participating.  This solves one problem - people stop losing money - but also destroys the market.",1405511928

8041578,comment,8035332,8040451,2,0,weland,,,"There are good examples to see in well-written device drivers. I don&#x27;t have specific code at hand, but there are bits and pieces that stuck to me.<p>For example, there was this driver that could do pattern-matching on button presses, written by an ex-colleague of mine. The way this is done by most developers is to hardcode some state machines (there&#x27;s a limited set of patterns that have to be matched anyway) and populate an array of callbacks for each. This one did something rather different (hopefully, I can remember what; it&#x27;s been a few years since I&#x27;ve seen that code).<p>The patterns it had to recognize were arbitrary combinations of short and long button press or hold sequence, double presses and triple presses. Instead of having the state machines hardcoded, the programmer would define a state machine by defining an array of press patterns (e.g. button_event_t events[] = {BTN_CLICK, BTN_HOLD, BTN_DBL_CLICK, BTN_SEQ_END}) and register it with the driver, which added it into a list of patterns to match against. Each pattern could also have as many callbacks to be launched as needed.<p>The button driver itself had absolutely no idea about all this pattern crap, all it did was receive interrupts from GPIO ports and place them in a queue. An &quot;event&quot; matcher would munch on that queue, interpret elementary events (like button was pressed, button was depressed, button was held etc.) and put these in another queue that was pushed to the &quot;action&quot; matcher. Each time there was an interaction with it, it would start a new pattern matching drill; it would walk the list of events it knew about, &quot;add&quot; those whose first step matched the current one to a temporarily-used list (it was only adding pointers, of course, not copying the actual event) and &quot;remove&quot; the first press pattern (it would actually increment an index counter so as not to start copying bytes around). If nothing happened before a certain amount of time passed, the list would be disposed of. If it did, however, the temporary list would be walked again, removing those elements whose new first step didn&#x27;t match the current one, and so on until the list would be brought down to one element. The callbacks would then be scheduled to run (these were actually delayed jobs, not blocking function calls), the one-element list disposed of and so on.<p>This was beautifully structured in every possible way:<p>1. The button driver, that did the GPIO magic, only worked with GPIO interrupts.<p>2. Recognizing specific user presses was done by another subsystem, and<p>3. Recognizing specific <i>sequences</i> of user presses was done by another subsystem<p>None of these had to do anything foreign to them: the button driver (which encompassed roughly #1 and #2 with nice separation between them) only did button stuff. Matching sequences of button actions superficially sounds like &quot;button stuff&quot; which is why it&#x27;s routinely mashed in the same soup, with horrible results, but this one wasn&#x27;t.<p>It had the further advantage that now automatic testing of anything was blatantly trivial (background: each sequence of presses would trigger actions that could potentially take up to one hour), since events like BUTTON_PRESSED or BUTTON_HOLD didn&#x27;t have to come from actual interaction, they could be pushed in there by a test routine communicating with a PC through a serial port. Extending the range of possible actions or redefining them was trivial, since all that had to be done was edit arrays. It was also trivial to allow customization of these sequences by end-users.<p>But this is also aesthetically pleasing: there&#x27;s no conflict of abstraction between &quot;software&quot;and &quot;hardware&quot;. There is one module that abstracts only what is relevantly abstracted in hardware, and produces purely software-abstractions, that are meaningful only to humans, not silicon, such as BUTTON_HOLD events (silicon only knows about signals it translates into a bit flip which we like to call an interrupt). It didn&#x27;t push non-silicon stuff into software that spoke to silicon, nor did it push silicon stuff high up there where there should only be software stuff.<p>Oh yeah: this was on a microcontroller that had 4K of RAM, and the software also included a communication stack for some weird-ass protocol, a flash driver, a temperature sensor, energy metering, LED signaling, toggling an array of relays, driving a buzzer, a firmware upgrade mechanism, a sort of application settings manager, a clock (the kind that shows the hour) with multiple alarms and the rest of the OS, pretty much all of it written by us. This guy was a guru though. The parts written by me sucked.",1405511909

It&#x27;s also true for nearly every single deleted item in WP, including those which aren&#x27;t sufficiently notable. It&#x27;s also true of nearly every item which is currently rolled into a larger article.

Well-defined requirements and boundaries are not possible, only rough guidelines for most areas. This is one such area.<p>I agree that the information about B. plantaginea is weak. This is not atypical of biological entries in WP. Consider <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabash_tree"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabash_tree</a> , which I chose because it&#x27;s only a few lines longer than the short entry in the 1910 Encyclopedia Britannica.

How does it propagate? What does it even look like? Does it have defense mechanisms? Does it survive arid climates well? Are humans allergic to it at all?&quot;<p>Worse is the line &quot;The fruit pulp is used traditionally for respiratory problems.&quot; It doesn&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s actually effective, and if so, what is the method of treatment.

8041551,comment,8040540,8041505,4,0,VLM,,,"Two ways to do it<p>1) You have a defined position of your antenna... make the ephemeris &quot;work&quot; such that your antenna gets the right signal from the satellite.  In a philosophical sense, where is the satellite?  Well... does it really matter?  This ephemeris says your antenna is in the right place, so...<p>I&#x27;m not implying this is how it work or its a good idea, but it certainly is a good unit test if your &quot;real&quot; method when run thru a test bench implies you&#x27;re on the moon instead of at the (note singular) base station...<p>2) Those numbers are no big deal with doppler / frequency ranging.  If you transmit at 1500 MHz its a little higher as it approaches and lower as it leaves.  Ask a ham radio operator to demonstrate with their 144/440-ish MHz satellites, the doppler in low earth orbit is maybe 15 KHz or so.  Anyway sub-Hz accuracy measurement (no big deal) of a 1.5e9 Hz signal for a couple seconds gives you the -11th class of accuracy you&#x27;re looking for.  The absolute freq would be nice to know, but you can figure out the instant the satellite passed zenith (or any other elevation relative to your position) as long as the freq is &quot;short term more or less constant&quot;.  Of course giant and heavy earth bound clocks can give you that precise freq you&#x27;re looking for, which is also cool.<p>The doppler of a satellite pass is pleasingly non-linear and they&#x27;re high up enough so make for long passes and proper data analysis means you can downsample maybe 10000 samples to find the theoretical best RMS zenith instant for all 10000 samples, so oversampling and averaging gives you another couple orders of magnitude.<p>Maybe another way to say it, is if you have basically perfect accuracy clocks, and you sample and literally count every incoming cycle of a 1.5e9 RF signal for only 100 seconds even if you ignore phase data (why would you?  But for the sake of the argument...) then thats 1.5e11 cycles in a given time, a bit of division and you have a freq accurate to one cycle or part in 10 to the 11th.<p>Its more complicated in reality because the GPS signal is not a simple RF carrier but is a spread spectrum signal so you need a reasonably low noise and stable PLL to lock onto the SS signal and then you actually measure the SS signal.",1405511184

Languages that do need a runtime, like Java, aren&#x27;t slower than C++ because of the virtual machine per se (which otherwise does a good job at doing awesome optimizations that are only possible with runtime profiling), but rather the reliance on a garbage collector and the lack of options for fine tuning the memory layout / access patterns and unfortunately the runtime is not smart enough yet to do that for you. Every language that depends on a GC, but that wants to be close to C/C++ in performance, starts with this handicap, even though for most purposes an efficient garbage collector will behave much better than inefficient usage of malloc or a half-assed object pool.<p>Of course I wouldn&#x27;t worry about Rust&#x27;s performance either.",1405510911

I&#x27;m not a finance expert so I&#x27;ll probably get a few things wrong but is it fair to summarize the two perspectives as follows?<p>1. Jill is merely <i>quoting</i> a price for independent blocks of shares on independent exchanges. If a buy order is placed against that quoted price, she has the right to reissue quotes elsewhere.  This is no different from Jill selling apples at the market on 1st street, as well as at the market on 2nd street, then receiving a large order on 1st street that prompts her to call her sales manager on 2nd street and have him increase the price of apples there. Or for Janice, sitting next to Jill&#x27;s stall on 1st street, overhearing the sale at $17 and repricing her apples upwards for when the demand inevitably spills over to her stall.<p>2. Jill is making an <i>offer</i> to sell a combined block of shares at a particular price. Even though her offer is broken up over multiple exchanges, since a single buy order can execute on multiple exchanges her offer should hold across all of these exchanges. Yet she is taking advantage of the physical makeup of the market to bait large orders (thereby revealing market demand) and then switch to higher prices (thereby capturing a larger profit).<p>I emphasized &quot;quote&quot; and &quot;offer&quot; above because they capture two different concepts in contract law. I&#x27;m not sure if the concepts are the same in financial markets but the principle seems to be at the root of the disagreement. If Jill was merely &quot;quoting&quot;, unless the rules of the exchange specify otherwise, she is free to reissue her quote and therefore perspective #1 makes sense. If Jill was making an &quot;offer&quot; however, presumably she should be bound to the terms of her offer regardless of the physical details around how she publishes that offer, reinforcing perspective #2.<p>So:  do the market rules have such a distinction? I found the link [1] below which suggests both perspectives are valid - depending on the type of market one is participating in, if I understand it correctly. Is this a matter of people confusing the two types of markets?  (I have to say that perspective #2 seems pretty impractical to me in markets with multiple exchanges participating, and #1 doesn&#x27;t negatively impact the market -- either it makes economic sense for Jack to pay the new price or not, why do we care if he saves a few bucks if we fiddle with the rules?)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/quoteorderdrivenmarket.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/quoteorderdrivenm...</a>",1405509739

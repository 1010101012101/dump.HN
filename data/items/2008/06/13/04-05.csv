How do you deal with people who haven't contributed as much work as you have, who don't take initiative to do work on their own, and who don't 'get/grow the idea' as fast as you do? (some of these are gleaned from the article, some I just ask for myself).<p>Mark Z's actions, if his coworkers were to fall into these categories, are acceptable, and probably the only way to do it properly. And, considering the majority of his coworkers were college students who just happened to be nearby (not hired or specially picked), it is very likely that they didn't have the capicity or willpower to bring the company along as much as Z. did.",1213332424

They're written well enough for one to basically follow along the sentences, and the tone is such that it seems they're really understanding something I'm not. But I looked pretty deeply into these questions. I read the original papers of Einstein Podolsky and Rosen, of Bohr, of Born. I read much of John Bell's original work, and I'm pretty sure that there are results being assumed here (and elsewhere) that haven't really been proven, or were even originally stated.<p>For example, it's commonly asserted that Bell's theorem rules out any deterministic quantum mechanical description of reality with local hidden variables. But this was, to my knowledge, never shown explicitly by Bell -- he simply ruled out a particular class of local hidden variable theories. There exist theories, consistent with experiment, which are local and deterministic: for what it's worth, a toy example is just a classical computer simulating everything in our universe we've yet seen.<p>We don't know where the Born probabilities come from, but we also don't really understand the implications of many body entanglement. We don't even have a consistent <i>definition</i> of entanglement for three or more particles. We don't know, we haven't been able to calculate, but I have reason to suspect, that measurement consistent with Born probabilities could be <i>entirely</i> explained by the deterministic axioms already part of Quantum Mechanics. We haven't really gone as far as we could go with them. And already people are treating Many-Worlds as axiomatic. I don't really buy it.",1213332421

216549,comment,216013,216013,0,0,designtofly,,,"This rant has nothing to do with the fundamentals of the company. It is a complaint about the under-performing stock. While I am a believer in the free market, I hardly think that the stock price is the be-all indicator. Let's face it, the stock price is a measure of the speculation of a company. As fashionable as it is to bash Microsoft, it's hard for MSFT to build speculative value. There's nothing that MSFT, with Ballmer or anyone else, can do to bring the wow-factor in this climate.<p>With MSFT bashing the ""in"" thing, the personal vendettas of the likes of Neelie Kroes (<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/technology/11soft.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/technology/11soft.html</a>), MSFT faces a futile battle if they want to raise the stock price. I applaud MSFT and Ballmer for not giving into Wall St. and foolishly trying to boost the stock price at all costs. I think MSFT is extremely well positioned to be an industry leader.<p>The other problem is that MSFT has become so diversified, that speculation is difficult since the success of any particular business unit gets diluted on the bottom line. In addition, no one seems to care or pick up on a lot of really great Microsoft successes. For instance, Microsoft’s Health Vault (<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/10/business/10kaiser.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/10/business/10kaiser.html</a>). You can bet that if Apple came out with a program like that, the stock price would shoot up 20% overnight.<p>In summary, I think MSFT is still a great company that is well positioned and I am happy to have Ballmer at the top. He is a great businessman that understands how the company operates. He certainly doesn't have the charisma and cult-following of Steve Jobs, but I don't think MSFT needs that to do well.",1213331591

They're actually pretty well written (I'd rate them above David Deutsch's Fabric of Reality, frinstance -- though I don't consider that very high praise), but I recommend taking them with a grain of salt.<p>Example: <i>We have embarrassed our Earth long enough by failing to see the obvious.  So for the honor of my Earth, I write as if the existence of many-worlds were an established fact, because it is.  The only question now is how long it will take for the people of this world to update.</i> --- Sheesh, that kind of thing just doesn't belong in any scientific debate.<p>The domain name bothers me as well.

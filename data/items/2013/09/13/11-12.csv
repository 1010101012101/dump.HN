6379855,comment,6379332,6379578,3,0,ams6110,,,"It has nothing to do with Fox News. Television news across the board is a vehicle to sell advertising. While there&#x27;s still some component that tries to be informative, it&#x27;s mostly about attracting and holding an audience being entertaining or dramatic, like any other television programming. This is why previously unremarkable occurrences such as hot weather in August are now reported like airplane crashes.<p>Given that audiences have an ever-increasing SMS-, Twitter-, and Facebook-molded attention span, you are expecting the impossible to expect that television news will ever provide more than a cursory overview of anything.<p>The on-air presenters in most if not all cases are NOT experts at what they are reporting. They are selected based on their looks, personality, and ability to read a teleprompter without. sounding. like. they. are. reading.<p>But you also have to remember that news networks like Fox and CNN have to fill 24 hours a day, under intense pressure to be the first on-air with reports of &quot;breaking news.&quot; So they can&#x27;t spend a lot of time fact-checking and polishing every story. This is quite unlike the previous generation network &quot;evening news&quot; shows which were 30 minutes once a day and they could spend all day honing and checking the content of that 30 minutes.<p>Bottom line, if you want to be informed about anything, don&#x27;t watch television news. Seek out longer form reporting by subject matter experts (easier than ever to find online) or go straight to the source (in this case, help.github.com would be good).<p>Getting upset or indignant about this is a waste of energy.",1379073505

The less others know that you know something, the more power you have.<p>For that reason, it is unlikely that we will <i>see</i> these powers used by the NSA, or other government. It is in their best interest to hold on to that data as secretly as possible and as restrictively as possible, to avoid the chance of others getting a hold of the data. Snowden if anything has only given the NSA <i>and all others who hold the information that we do not know about</i> reason to be careful open even mentioning that they have the data, to anyone.",1379073498

Fox got it wrong to be sure however reporting on financials doesn&#x27;t make it necessary to be an expert in the technical aspects. There are plenty of software engineers building business software that don&#x27;t know the first thing about calls and puts, options and derivatives trading strategies despite the fact that they build software that drives those systems.<p>I won&#x27;t cut Fox any slack, however lets ask ourselves -- did MSNBC or CNN ever cover this story at all? The gist of the Fox story was to talk about the value of the company, not the details of what a &#x27;fork&#x27; is. Besides, how many VCs have we been in front of that don&#x27;t have any clue about the tech in which they are prepared to invest millions of dollars?<p>Even worse is how many engineers at startups have no clue about the business aspects of investing, valuations, dilution, option pools and such. Many engineers who think of themselves as &#x27;startup people&#x27; have no idea what convertible notes are nor even how to read a deal memo. And forget about talking about valuations -- nobody know about that, yet many people claim they&#x27;re valued at $1 million or whatever without any clue about where those numbers come from. I&#x27;m generalizing of course, but the exceptions really prove the rule.<p>There&#x27;s something in the Bible I think about casting the first stone.. It might apply here. Pointing out the inaccuracy is certainly relevant, but using that as a rationalization of pre-conceived notions about Fox isn&#x27;t really fair. I remember when I was in the Army in 2003 and CNN reporters embedded with our unit had no idea about the chemical weapons about which they were supposedly reporting. How many times have I heard &quot;machine gun&quot; used when describing an M4 rifle.. Another example is when news outlets say &#x27;CIA Agent&#x27; when they actually mean CIA Officer. An agent is a foreign asset, no actual CIA employee is ever an &#x27;agent.&#x27; Yet the media gets it wrong almost constantly. Snowden, for example wasn&#x27;t an &#x27;NSA employee&#x27; as was reported by many outlets, but a Booz Hamilton employee. The reporting on Syria has been questionable as well -- not just from a bias standpoint, but from a pure ignorance of the political forces within Syria that are driving their civil war. So excuse me if I hardly give a shit about Fox getting the definition of &quot;fork&quot; wrong. I&#x27;m pretty sure a large number of us would get the definition wrong of the financial terms &quot;Special Purpose Vehicle&quot; or &quot;Trust Preferred Security&quot; if we suddenly switched places with a Fox Business reporter.<p>So sure Fox got some irrelevant details wrong, but every news outlet does that every day. Those details didn&#x27;t affect the intent of the story or the material facts, so who cares? We could start an entire board on simply media misteps and it would be filled with content on a daily basis.",1379070579

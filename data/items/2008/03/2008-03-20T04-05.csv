After this, life is easier for those with the mainstream viewpoint, and new people join the establishment.<p>Case in point: I'm working on a paper right now in foundations of quantum mechanics. I did most of the work with Bohmian mechanics as my mental model (as a result of being exposed to a ""deviant""). That viewpoint helped a lot, and I probably wouldn't have built my model without it. Note that the model is completely justifiable without it, but it's an unmotivated magic trick.<p>I've given talks about it from a non-standard perspective. People attack that. I've also talked about it, pretending it's black magic that yields a result everyone knows. People love that.<p>The result is the same, but I have an easier time promoting it if it looks mainstream.<p>It's no wonder people stick to the establishment. Even I'm going to stick to the establishment when it comes time to submit the paper.",1205989133

I currently use Gmail, and it works fine with my iPhone's Mail program, but the paradigm shift between it and Gmail is a bit of a pain.  iPhone's Mail doesn't have search, and doesn't organize things by thread.  If someone at Google can port offline Gmail over to the iPhone, that would be two shades of awesome!",1205988621

141439,story,,,8,12,hbien,"Ask YC: Is it a doomed product if the barrier to entry is too high?",,"I love programming web apps - especially with the latest frameworks.  But I don't want to host them, I'd rather have them be self-hosted because I'm already enjoying my full time job.  Anyways, I made a web app and finished a licensing scheme for it but I'm having second thoughts.<p>I think the barrier of entry is just way too high.  This particular app requires you to install it on your own shared/vps and host it yourself..  Mint was successful for this (haveamint.com not mint.com), but that was a PHP app which is a lot easier to deploy than Django or Rails.<p>Anyways, what do you guys think?  People are saying desktop software is dying because the barrier to install it is too high.  If that's the case, I don't think a self-hosted Django or Rails product will do well at all.<p>Thanks for your input!",1205988402

If you admit it failed, it shows that you're humble enough to admit when something went wrong without shifting blame.<p>I figure running a startup is like getting your MBA... but on crack.",1205987899
141432,comment,140602,140602,0,0,hollerith,,,"It seems to me that a startup can reduce its risk by swapping stock with another startup.  That way, if either startup has a liquidity event, then the founders of both startups get approximately half as rich as they would have without the swap.  Of course, more than just two startups can participate in a stock-pooling arrangement, reducing the participant's risk further.<p>Of course a startup does not want to swap stock share-for-share with just any other startup, and there are startups whose prospects are so dim that even if they offer 5 or 10 shares for every share of yours, you would not want to swap stock with them.  And learning enough about another startup to judge their expected earnings is a lot of work.  But sometimes the work has already been done for you, by YC for example.<p>There exists what economists call a ""moral hazard"" here: namely, once a startup has swapped stock with more than one or two other startups, its optimal strategy is for its founders not to put themselves out (that is, to coast, to relax) and rely on the possibility that one of the other startups will make a lot of money.  But this is the same concern any individual founder has when he takes on any co-founder, and the solution is the same: you have (or someone you can trust has) to watch the other startups with whom you have swapped stock closely enough to verify that they are working as hard as you are.  (YC's requirement that the startups it invests in must all move to the same city makes it easier for YC startups to watch each other in this way.)  Along with that you will want to give yourself a time frame (1 year seems about right) during which time you can back out of the stock swap deal if you believe the startup you are swapping stock with is not putting themselves out (or has misrepresented themselves in negotiations with you).<p>I can think of several way to refine this strategy to deal fairly for example with the situation in which one startup gives up after 18 months while another works hard for four years, but I will stop here for now.",1205987887

I'm just not impressed by the people who wrap the features I've used since 1989 in a shiny new bow and try to sell them to me as the future of Facebook. It's nice to appreciate those features once and a while, but most of us have been using them all along!<p>I also agree that Facebook, itself, is going to reach its limit (if it hasn't already) in exactly the way you said.<p>Meanwhile, we can start this conversation again the next time this comes up. :)",1205986841

I left about a month earlier and got our paper work together (business documents and the like.) I was also able to raise a little money from friends and family before we started.  We have not taken a salary in months, and both of us have been living off our savings.  We are young (25/24) so money is tight.<p>We had an idea, but could never have gotten things started if we didn't take a leap of faith.  Quitting and getting things moving is the hardest thing to do.  The first month feels very scary. We only had an idea, but in my opinion it was worth it to quit. I hope this helps.",1205986265

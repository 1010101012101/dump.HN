With $1.5M you can spend $50k a year for thirty years without even factoring in continued earnings on that money or $20k/year in social security payments. Once you do factor those in, you'll die with more than the $1.5M you started with in retirement funds.",1279472344

Writing code with Reason is much more like using a dynamic language, with a full library like Java or .Net.<p>It supports raii, but doesnt use exception handling and doesnt bother with const nonsense or over the top inheritance restrictions.  In fact pretty much everything in Reason is public and designed to be derived, modified or enhanced.<p>It has generic programming features, but doesnt force you to write everything as templates (a classic mistake that the standard library makes).  For example, you can have an iterator of int's without caring what the underlying container type is, so your code and algorithms can actually be generic, not just infectious templates.<p>Unlike a lot of C++ frameworks and libraries, its not specifically focused on networking, or a few esoteric template classes or collection libraries.<p>Reason is a fully featured systems programming framework with a complete interface to all the usual posix api's and everything else you would expect from a modern language.  It has strings, regexes, streams, parsers, sockets, threads, filesystem, encryption, encoding, xml, xpath, collections, time and date, sql (mysql, postgress, sqlite), http (client/server), smart pointers, formatting, logging, and much more.<p>But the features are perhaps not as important as how it is written.  It is simple, and very object oriented, everything is designed to work togeather cleanly and obey the principle of least surprise.  Just like Python and Ruby, Reason allows you to do a lot in a very small amount of code.<p>So if your wondering how you can have the simplicity of C, with just the good parts of C++, heres your answer.<p><a href=""http://reasoning.info"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reasoning.info</a>",1279472322

1526117,comment,1525933,1526042,0,0,dfox,,,"Generational GC's are what almost every high-performance VM uses and this approach is well-tested in many practical systems. Almost all aplications tend to allocate large amounts of temporary objects, while having large amounts of memory consumed by long-living objects (I would assume that at least one half of used memory in this case are long-living objects). Also, because generational GC is almost invariably copying GC (it is possible to make non-moving generational GC, but that is more of academic interest) it tends to improve caching behavior, which is even more important with each new generation of CPUs.<p>Main reason why copying and generational GCs are not used everywhere is that they tend to generally complicate matters when you want to seamlessly interface with C code (non-managed code in .NET terms), because objects then tend to be moved around by GC, which has to see and be able to update every reference to it's heap.<p>In most applications and runtimes, there are a lot more behind the stages objects allocated by VM and or library routines than objects that you allocate directly in your code.<p>Edit: and I think that Sun's JVM uses generational GC at least since 1.3, if not 1.2.",1279472217

I thought you meant touchy-feely as a definition for ""a woman's touch"" so to speak. In other words, being more sensitive. For example, my mom is quite compassionate and empathetic, so she would be more ""touchy-feely"" about some topics than I might be, but she is the last person that would ever intentionally be a backstabber. I'm not sure if this makes sense, and we may still have some miscommunication. I'm just trying to get more insight into the female perspective, but I think you are saying that often times females may be quicker to be deceitful when talking with one another, whereas males will be blunt and upfront, even if it means offending someone.

I know to look out for the whoppers due to similar reasons.<p>The better developers and projects demonstrate a uniformity of quality.  (A project can hose over a good developer when it wrests control from them and/or hides needed information from them.)  There are less small scale bugs because there's been due time for consideration and a concern for getting things right.  Often, there has been a deliberate reduction in features -- the developers have learned what truly matters and -- given outright or de facto the ability to do so -- have stripped away the rest.  They may leave the design open enough to add things in the future as need is demonstrated.  But they don't fuck around with them now.<p>There may still be some whoppers -- I've found some under such circumstances.  But they are less likely.  And when there are, hidden as they may initially be, they stand out more upon identification.  And fixing them, for all of their deeper implications, still tends to be easier.  It's a lot easier to concentrate and do deep work, when you're not busing swatting a thousand mosquitoes.<p>Applying quality more strongly and uniformly at the front end pays off in this manner.  The work goes deeper and solves more fundamentally and insightfully the problem that's really at hand.  And when it needs to pivot -- I guess that's the current buzz word -- it's not held down by a thousand tiny tendrils, each on it's own insignificant, but accumulating with the tenacity of Velcro.",1279472001

1526103,comment,1525983,1525983,0,0,JangoSteve,,,"I've found tools such as Google Alerts, Social Mention, and Social Blaze (and LeadNuke since I created it) to be indespinsable for generating lists of potential customers. I think the most difficult part is getting inside your potential customers' heads to figure out what they would be saying if they needed your product/service.<p>For instance, for RateMyStudentRental, my target customer (i.e. school) will be having problems with their off-campus student housing. So, if they're having problems, I will hear about it one of 3 ways:<p>--1. a school administrator will write about it usually on some forum or housing community online.<p>--2. a student will say (on twitter, facebook, etc) how much their housing or landlord sucks.<p>--3. a landlord or local housing association will decide they need to do something about it and create a local workshop or call a meeting for the townsfolk.<p>--4. the media will call it out by publishing an article about the state of the campus housing in the area.<p>--5. some combination of the above.<p>So the trick is knowing what sort of language to look for online. For each case above, I would look for phrases like this, respectively:<p>--1. ""what should we do"" + ""campus housing""<p>--2. ""housing sucks"", ""landlord sucks""<p>--3. ""meeting"" + ""campus|student housing"", ""state of off-campus housing"", etc.<p>--4. city|county name + ""student|campus|university housing""<p>--5. general terms like ""student housing"", ""campus housing"", ""student rental"", etc.<p>This advice I think applies to all industries, not just student rental housing of course. For instance, if you're web development consulting company, you're probably looking for phrases like ""needs web application"", ""needs web development"", ""looking for software"", etc.<p>I think a rookie mistake that people (e.g. web development companies) make is paying attention to phrases like ""rails development.""<p>The problem is, if you're a web development consultancy, your target market doesn't know or care what Rails is or how you build the damn thing, they just know they need something on the computer that does what they need it to. So, if you just look for ""rails development"" keywords online, you're just going to get a bunch of funded startups and the like who just want to hire another programmer for their team, and it's a waste of your time (and theirs if you respond).",1279471871
1526102,comment,1523276,1525118,0,0,tptacek,,,"Also, look at how subtle the code needs to be to handle failures with h_errno --- you have to call gethostbyname, check h_errno regardless of what it returns, and then read the hostent; and, unlike certificate checks, this has to happen in every single place you ever use a domain name.<p>Also, what do you do when h_errno says something is tainted? First, you need to distinguish between transient and permanent failures. Now you need UI for both. Which means you've added another state machine hop in your program in every place you look up names (note that most network programs, even when they're async, <i>don't</i> bother to design host lookup asynchronously) --- what was one function call is now three functions, everywhere you look up names.<p>Anyone who uses curl to do stuff on the web probably knows the flag to turn cert checking off. Curl and wget are somewhat unique in needing to care about validation. Observe that now every single program that does anything with the network, from ""ping"" through ""ftp"", now needs a flag and a sensible default for how to handle broken names.<p>Yeah, this just <i>isn't going to work</i>.",1279471819

1526013,comment,1525587,1525587,0,0,bluedanieru,,,"This article kind of misses the point.  That is, it seems to focus too much on the effect of dismantling the projects and moving people around, and not at all on why they got there.  And it accepts at face value the proposition that these cities were moving those people out of the projects, sometimes out of city limits, for the purpose of improving their lives and in that way fighting poverty, crime, etc.  I find it truly hard to believe that any city in the US would undergo that kind of effort to help out poor black people.  The idea should strain anyone's credulity.  More likely that more affluent white folks want to live in the city these days, and cities want that tax revenue.  Sure, efforts were made in some cases to try to improve the lives of the people being displaced, but as an afterthought and not as the prime motivator.  I mean, this demographic shift has been underway for a while now, where folks are leaving the suburbs and moving back to the cities, and property values are going up there, and generally life is improving in the cities.  I can't tell if it's the intent, but this article almost seems to lay responsibility for all this on some changes to a federal housing program.  It's nonsense.  And the idea that mayors and city councils nationwide don't want to hear about the damaging effects of this displacement because it disproves their theories on poverty is certainly complete horseshit.  They don't want to hear it because they've got their shiny new neighborhood, crime is down, and whatever happens in the suburbs they don't give a shit because it isn't their problem anymore.  And regarding their theories on poverty, well they haven't got any of those.  They're politicians, not sociologists.  They have elections.<p>So what this article should have been about, but isn't, is why we still have so many poor black people committing so many crimes and taking up so much space in so many prisons, over 40 years since the civil rights movement, and in spite of the fact that most of America can apparently get its shit together enough to vote for a black man for President anyway.<p>The answer to that one is pretty straightforward, well known, and easy to understand.  And it has little to nothing to do with race.  America is simply not an egalitarian society.  It never really has been, but over the past 30 years or so it's moved away from it faster than ever.  The gap between rich and poor in America is remarkably high, and with that fact come all sorts of social ills (see below).  And not just for the poor either, but quality of life tends to decrease across the board.  The libertarian position that a rising tide will lift all boats, or that income distribution doesn't matter as long as average wage continues to increase, this idea that remains popular across the political spectrum in the US, and that is wholly within the sphere of consensus in the US media, <i>does not pass scientific muster.</i>  It is absolute shit.  And as Americans seem incapable of even <i>discussing</i> this simple fact yet, the problem of poverty and social dysfunction in America, among blacks as well as whites, et al, will remain unsolved.<p><a href=""http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/docs/social-dysfunction.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/docs/social-dysfunction.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.cognitionandculture.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=602:better-live-in-sweden-or-anywhere-else-than-in-the-us-why-more-equal-societies-almost-always-do-b&catid=37:nicolas&Itemid=34"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cognitionandculture.net/index.php?option=com_cont...</a>",1279469567

You could have an extemely well diversified portfolio and still lose money when The Market as a whole tanks as a result of bad decisions of other people. You could have money saved up in multiple savings accounts or bonds and be out of luck when a government you didn't vote for fucks up and causes a period of hyperinflation. I'm not even mentioning things utterly out of individual control like a war resulting from an invasion by an aggressive, more powerful neighbour.<p>Implementation details such as retirement age are very important, of course, but a from mile-high view, providing a decent if not extraordinary living standard to millions of people seems exactly like the type of infrastructure and public good projects governments are normally the best option for.<p>/jarek, who nevertheless has more private savings right now than ""a quarter of those surveyed""",1279469566

The median household income in the United States today is about $50k, so if you estimate 80% of your income for retirement, that's $40k. The conditional life expectancy of a 65-year-old is ~17 yrs, and inching up very slowly, so maybe will be 20 years in a few decades. So that's $800k in today's money, modulo investments.<p>And that's assuming <i>zero</i> contribution from social security. Even if social security gets chopped at some point, I don't expect it to go all the way to $0; people working today and paying in will probably get <i>some</i> payout.

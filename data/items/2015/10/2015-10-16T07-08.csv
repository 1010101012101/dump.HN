They were specified in CSS2 which became a recommendation in 1998, which is 17 years ago (!).<p>But due to the IE6 dominance and abandonment it took many years before this part of css was broadly supported by browsers, so developers had to either use html tables (even when not semantically appropriate) or use hacks like floats (which was not designed for this) to achieve a table-like layout. So the age of hack was due to browsers not supporting css, not to to deficiencies in css as such.<p>That said, html tables never displayed identically across browsers before css. There were lots of corner cases e.g. with the interaction of fixed and flexible columns.

10398012,comment,10397555,10397555,0,0,confiscate,,,"tldr; Diversity and Equality are not the main starting points nor goal of Women-in-Tech. Increasing women&#x27;s role in tech helps improve diversity/equality, but is not the real mission of Women-in-Tech. Diversity/Equality is a (side) effect, and not the cause, of the Women-in-Tech movement.<p>I think there&#x27;s a tendency for Women-in-Tech PR to equate Diversity/Equality with Women-in-Tech, when in fact, Women-in-Tech is supposed to advance, well, Women in the tech sector, and not Equality/Diversity in general. The 2 are Not the same thing, although they are often claimed to be basically the same for PR reasons.<p>It&#x27;s getting so severe that even the author is &quot;shocked&quot; that Women-in-Tech events are less than diverse. She shouldn&#x27;t be surprised--the fact that she was surprised, indicates she&#x27;s bought into the whole &quot;Women-in-Tech&#x27;s mission is for workplace Equality&quot; idea, which is false.<p>To be clear, I think Women-in-Tech is a noble cause, and I am all for supporting it. But please stop claiming that Women-in-Tech &quot;is for diversity&quot;--it is for advancing women&#x27;s role in tech. To be clear, I think in and of itself this is great because I&#x27;d love to see more women in the tech industry. But we should stop claiming that the mission of the movement is for &quot;diversity&quot;, because &quot;diversity&quot; is not what drives the women-in-tech movement, and is not it&#x27;s main goal. The main goal is to increase women&#x27;s role, and not &quot;diversity/equality&quot; in general. If the movement&#x27;s main goal was purely &quot;diversity/equality&quot;, then it wouldn&#x27;t be called &quot;Women-in-Tech&quot;--there are other misrepresented groups that are much more in urgent need of equal representation, that the movement would have focused on first if Diversity and Equality were the main motivators.<p>I also agree with the author&#x27;s photo of an all-white panel as being pretty funny :) It reminds me of the cast of Friends. Saying that the cast of Friends is &quot;Diverse&quot; or &quot;Equal&quot; would be kind of ridiculous.",1444981900

While I don&#x27;t see anything <i>illegal</i> about an adult performer pretending to be younger in a fictional context (but with the requisite 2257 filings in place) it would certainly border on commercial suicide due to adverse publicity, not to mention international problems (eg UK law is now considerably stricter on obscenity, banning the appearance of various acts as well as the performance thereof in real life).<p>Now I can certainly see how a fictional kidnapping and rape could be similarly problematic, and the material I&#x27;ve seen steers away from such themes (but there&#x27;s some self-selection bias there as that&#x27;s not erotic to me anyway). But ISTM you&#x27;d have a very strong defense under the first amendment notwithstanding the graphic nature of the amterial. I mean, I can watch films like <i>Nymphomaniac</i> or <i>The Night Porter</i> on Netflix or DVD even though they are both graphic and include scenes of sexual coercion.

10397938,comment,10392731,10395514,0,0,paulojreis,,,"> That&#x27;s exactly how Bootstrap&#x27;s classes for lists work. And they are tied to the DOM structure, though not necessarily to particular elements: .my-list has to go on a container element, and .my-list__item has to go onto children of that element.<p>Not quite exactly. My solution doesn&#x27;t require list items to be child elements of the list. Bootstrap&#x27;s &quot;list item&quot; needs (by definition/rule) to be a &quot;direct&quot; descendant - a child element of a given type (a selector with &quot;> li&quot;) of the list. They have classes for lists, and then style the list items via element and &quot;descendancy&quot; (i.e. .my-list > li).<p>If somewhere along the way you decide/are asked to change the mark-up in order to have an element for grouping list items (so, you&#x27;d have elements between the list and list items ), Bootstrap&#x27;s way of creating rules wouldn&#x27;t work anymore - list items wouldn&#x27;t be child elements of the list, despite you wanting to keep the styling in them. Independently of how you solved this in the mark-up, if your rule was like Bootstrap&#x27;s .my-list > li, then it wouldn&#x27;t work anymore because list-items wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;direct&quot; descendants of .my-list.<p>This might seem minor or unusual, but I assure it&#x27;s not - this is the kind of changes in structure that happen very frequently and make DOM-tied CSS fail. And bear in mind the Tetris effect on this: your less-than-experienced team member might solve this with yet another rule, but a even more specific one (.my-list > .group > li) which will yield harder to maintain CSS (this rule is very specific; it would need even more specific rules to be overridden when necessary). If your development rule was &quot;no DOM tying; just use classes), the problem of escalating specificity would&#x27;ve also been avoided.<p>> The point I was trying to make was that at a component level, your CSS classes are usually going to depend on a particular hierarchy in the DOM elements that the classes are applied to, or they won&#x27;t work correctly. How much of a dependency you have is a tradeoff; you can design your framework to minimize the dependency, but you&#x27;re likely to create a more complicated framework in exchange.<p>I understand your point, but I don&#x27;t agree with the notion that &quot;but you&#x27;re likely to create a more complicated framework in exchange&quot; by minimizing the dependency on the DOM. You&#x27;re likely, definitely, to create a more verbose CSS framework, with a way bigger amount of classes. But I don&#x27;t think this is the same as complicated; it&#x27;s more verbose, it may require you to write more code[1], but I think it&#x27;s very predictable and easier to follow by team members with different expertise levels.<p>P.S. Also, bear in mind that BEM-like solutions also have hierarchy. Elements which belong to blocks. They just don&#x27;t depend on a specific hierarchy on the DOM; DOM hierarchy is independent of styling hierarchy.<p>[1] I&#x27;d argue it will make you write more code <i>in the beginning</i>. Traditional DOM-tied styling will eventually catch-up and the code you have to write to overwrite &quot;over-specific&quot; selectors and similar issues will grow bigger.",1444980392

10397931,comment,10397026,10397859,0,0,akkartik,,,"Thanks for the kind words! I&#x27;m particularly gratified that you found the literate/ subdirectory. There&#x27;s some details about it at <a href=""http://akkartik.name/post/wart-layers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://akkartik.name/post/wart-layers</a>, but it sounds like you understand the point already so I&#x27;m preaching to the choir :)<p><i>&quot;What kind of things have surprised you about Wart during development?&quot;</i><p>I stopped working on wart at some point for two reasons. First, I realized that I was falling into a blind spot shared with many contemporary programmers: blindly assuming that the way to improve the state of programming was by creating a new language. But there is more to programming than languages. Languages just happen to be memetically tempting sirens to chase after. Second, I painted myself into a corner with wart because I made it <i>too</i> late-bound, so late-bound that it was incredibly inefficient and so hard to optimize. (I think it might still be possible, but I lost patience partly because of the previous point.) I still like my infix scheme and have a particularly soft spot for the way wart allows keyword arguments anywhere in any function call. See, for example, the use of <i>:from</i> in a webserver implementation that makes everything so much clearer: <a href=""https://github.com/akkartik/wart/blob/ce64882c69/071http_server.wart#L17"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/akkartik/wart/blob/ce64882c69/071http_ser...</a>. However, I&#x27;ve forced myself to harden my heart and ruthlessly ignore considerations of syntax, and focus on what I think are more impactful directions: conveying global rather than local structure of programs. More details: <a href=""http://akkartik.name/about"" rel=""nofollow"">http://akkartik.name/about</a>. In brief, I&#x27;m working on ways to super-charge automatic tests (by making them white-box, and by designing the core OS services to be easy to test) and version control (using the literate layers you noticed). It&#x27;s a whole new way of programming where a) readers can ask &quot;why not write this like this?&quot;, make a change, run all tests and feel confident that the change is ok if all tests pass; and b) readers can play with a simple version of the program running just layer 1, then gradually learn about new features by running layers 1+2, 1+2+3, and so on.<p>---<p><i>&quot;The problem is that it throws away the ability for the code to pull updates from library maintainers. If the import is &quot;pinned&quot; at commit f1d2d2f9, then you push a security-related patch to akkartik/bar, most existing code will stay vulnerable forever, because most code is never maintained after being written.&quot;</i><p>I hadn&#x27;t considered hard-coding hashes in imports, because it&#x27;s historically been very hard to truly distinguish compatible changes from incompatible ones without introducing bugs. I think it&#x27;s more important to give people control over upgrades than to try to improve over the current advisory+pull method of communicating security issues.<p>You&#x27;re right that most code is never maintained after being written. But most code is also utterly unimportant to anyone including the author. So that failure of security is ok :) Trying to force concern about security only increases the moral hazard -- people get used to other people thinking about their security for them.<p><i>&quot;were there any ambiguities with indentation-as-parens? I haven&#x27;t thought about it rigorously, so I was just wondering if there are any corner cases to watch out for when I add it.&quot;</i><p>The big insight, I think, is to not fear parentheses too much. A common failure mode of such approaches (like <a href=""http://readable.sourceforge.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://readable.sourceforge.net</a> and <a href=""http://dustycloud.org/blog/wisp-lisp-alternative"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dustycloud.org/blog/wisp-lisp-alternative</a>) is to create too many new token types and lose the simplicity of lisp syntax. My approach instead is to a) just use parens sooner than look &quot;outright barbarous&quot; (<a href=""https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm</a>), and b) take it a step further and disable all indent-sensitivity inside parentheses.<p>Anyways, that&#x27;s my two cents. The precise rules I use are at <a href=""https://github.com/akkartik/wart/blob/master/004optional_parens"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/akkartik/wart/blob/master/004optional_par...</a>. (They&#x27;re really in the first couple of sentences there.)<p>---<p><i>&quot;Whoaaa, you use tangle/weave! How do you like it / what do you think about literate programming?&quot;</i><p>Like I said above, I like it very much, especially in combination with tests and a notion of layers.

It&#x27;s taking a bit, and it&#x27;ll be tricky to add true greenthread support to js and lua, but it&#x27;s a win so far.<p>Wart is freaking cool!  Thanks for showing that.  Whoaaa, you use tangle/weave!  How do you like it / what do you think about literate programming?  I was batting around the idea of writing code that way, but it seemed like tangle might not be the best solution.  But I love your 000prefix naming scheme; I instinctively do that for branches.  After reading through a few files starting at <a href=""https://github.com/akkartik/wart/blob/master/literate/000organization"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/akkartik/wart/blob/master/literate/000org...</a> it became pretty clear how wart worked, pretty quickly.  I&#x27;m mainly wary of the &quot;compile&quot; step that using Tangle implies; do you find it slows you down much?  Would you choose to do it that way if starting fresh?<p><i>What would a language ecosystem be like without any backwards-compatibility guarantees, super easy to change and fork promiscuously?</i><p>It&#x27;s fun to find someone has been mulling over the same problems!<p>I was considering taking Laarc in a similar direction:<p><pre><code>  (import &quot;akkartik/foo&quot;)
</code></pre>
That would check whether the folder &quot;../foo/akkartik&quot; exists, and if not, clone foo from github.com/akkartik/foo.<p>It would also rewrite its own source code to look like:<p><pre><code>  (import &quot;akkartik/bar&quot; &quot;f1d2d2f924e986ac86fdf7b36c94bcdf32beec15&quot;)
</code></pre>
That means whenever someone clones your codebase, running the program would cause them to clone github.com/akkartik/bar using commit f1d2d2f9.<p>So it&#x27;s static linking, basically.  It&#x27;s a guarantee that &quot;This source code will always work, the same way (+ 1 2) will always yield 3.  You could copy-paste this source code into a gist, and whoever ran it would end up running the same program.&quot;<p>That removes dependency hell / worrying about versions entirely.  But it&#x27;s not the right solution, and I&#x27;ve been searching for a better one.  What do you think?<p>The problem is that it throws away the ability for the code to pull updates from library maintainers.  If the import is &quot;pinned&quot; at commit f1d2d2f9, then you push a security-related patch to akkartik/bar, most existing code will stay vulnerable forever, because most code is never maintained after being written.<p>I was thinking of following that model, but using the convention that libraries are expected to use git tags in order to indicate major.minor.patch, and (import &quot;akkartik/bar&quot; &quot;f1d2d2f924e986ac86fdf7b36c94bcdf32beec15&quot;) will bump itself to the next commit if it&#x27;s tagged as an increment of the patch version.<p>What kind of things have surprised you about Wart during development?  Any unexpected pitfalls or interesting discoveries along the way?  Thanks again for pointing it out!<p>By the way, were there any ambiguities with indentation-as-parens?  I haven&#x27;t thought about it rigorously, so I was just wondering if there are any corner cases to watch out for when I add it.",1444978913

600848,comment,600790,600835,0,0,Confusion,,,"<i>so if you wanted to do that why start your own company in the first place</i><p>I really don't understand this sentiment. Many entrepeneurs don't found a company because they don't want a regular job: they found a company because they have a good idea that they like to work on and there isn't a regular job that offers that. And because they think they can make a lot more money this way. Taking the money, while taking more money from MegaCorp for a job where you can work on what you like sounds like an excellent tradeoff, especially if you can convince them to let you work under your own rules.<p>I am very suspicious of people that found companies only because they ""don't want a regular job"". There are lots of different regular jobs and many in which you have lots of responsibility and set/plan your own rules/project. They come close to a startup. In my book, generalizing 'regular jobs' implies stupidity.",1241858730

It's certainly getting popular, but in terms of ROI? Well, we'll have to wait and see if it generates any revenue.<p>Making something people want is great, but it's only half the battle. You have to be able to translate that into something they want that you can make money from. Twitter hasn't shown they have any clue how to do that yet.",1241858059

Recently, as a result of an item here, I read an article from which a single line has stuck.  It wasn't the most profound, it wasn't the most amusing, it wasn't even necessarily the most valuable, but it's one that has immediately made me think differently, and will be with me a long time.<p>I'd like to create a collection of such things.  I'm pretty sure things that affect you guys will be of varying value, but if we make a list and then let them float up and down as they get modded, maybe we'll get something interesting.<p>Replies are discouraged.  These will not be universal truths, they will not be unarguable, but I suggest that this is not the place.  Perhaps if you <i>really</i> disagree you can blog about it and submit a link.

For many, the two most important things about a job (other than the work itself) is the compensation (salary/equity) and health insurance.

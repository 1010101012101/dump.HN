Creepy, yes, but also enough to determine that the man behind the pseudonym is alive and well.<p>And, since one of the suspected reasons for why he chose to disappear as he did was ""people prying into his real-life non-_why identity"", it's probably best if we leave it at that.",1261238339

If a program can manipulate itself at runtime in arbitrary ways (not just reflect on itself in a read-only fashion), those proofs become invalid.",1261237593

1004815,comment,1004701,1004807,0,0,chriseidhof,,,"Yes. A lot of the meta-programming is actually programming over the structure. For example, given a Java class, you could generate database code. In Java, this relies heavily on introspection, but you if you're interested in doing this in a type-safe way then you could look at Generic Programming (in Haskell).<p>Also, you can generate code (at runtime) which is type-safe, compile the code, etc. Everything you ask for is possible in Haskell, however, it is definitely more complicated than in Lisp.",1261236454

Maybe it's just me but I rarely see them mocking themselves. As mentioned in the comments by another entrepreneur:<p><i>When I launched OtherInbox at TechCrunch50 in 2008, being “stealth” was a requirement for participation. We had to be launching something new that no one had heard about and secrecy was so important that we were told that we would be kicked out if anything leaked.<p>Maybe this should be reconsidered for 2010?</i><p>However, I do partly agree with the article. Some people are wayy to tight lipped about what they are working on, there's rarely a reason why someone can't speak in generalities about their project without going into exact details.",1261236025

1004810,comment,1004442,1004713,0,0,graphene,,,"It's interesting that in Norvig's talk you linked, while praising python, he also mentions that he is a supporter of the functional programming style for scientific work, both because it more transparently mirrors the mathematical formulation of the algorithm, and because it should make the use of massively parallel computations easier. I concede that there are currently few implementations of massively parallel, functional code (MapReduce and possibly Data Parallel Haskell come to mind) and it's true that the MPI-based Single Program, Multiple Data paradigm is dominant for now, the functional paradigm being but a very promising newcomer.<p>Given that, and the fact that languages such as Lisp, Haskell and OCaml are more aimed at the functional paradigm, wouldn't you agree that there is possibly a general shift going on in scientific programming in general, from Fortran/C(++) imperative style, via python, towards finally any of Haskell, Lisp and/or OCaml?<p>I don't really agree with your implication that the (at first) obscure way of doing things functionally makes the work less open, and that this makes it less desirable.\nIf everyone worked in exactly the same way, communication would be easier, but there would never be any disruptive change. I think letting everyone figure out for themselves what language works best for his/her appliciation has more merits than trying to enforce a standard, be it python + numpy & scipy, or anything else. If there turns out to be one clear winner, people will gravitate to that automatically, but you shouldn't argue for harmonization for its own sake.",1261235945

Might as well ask for a program that can compile any legal perl program [0].<p>That said, I suspect there's a lot that could be done to allow certain <i>subsets</i> of metaprogramming techniques in a static-typed language; some sort of crazy meta-type system that lets the compiler prove that something will only produce code with a particular polymorphic type, maybe?

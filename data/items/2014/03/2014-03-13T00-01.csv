Studies show that Western urban children grow up so closed off in man-made environments that their brains never form a deep or complex connection to the natural world. While studying children from the U.S., researchers have suggested a developmental timeline for what is called “folkbiological reasoning.” These studies posit that it is not until children are around 7 years old that they stop projecting human qualities onto animals and begin to understand that humans are one animal among many. Compared to Yucatec Maya communities in Mexico, however, Western urban children appear to be developmentally delayed in this regard. Children who grow up constantly interacting with the natural world are much less likely to anthropomorphize other living things into late childhood.&quot;<p>it seems to stop displaying words directly after the U.S., string.

7389464,comment,7388829,7389346,1,0,trobertson,,,"> with threaded comments, it&#x27;s very difficult to follow a discussion as it develops<p>I actually completely disagree with this. Threads allow for a single point of interest to spawn multiple straight-line conversations, where each thread pertains to a different facet of the original topic. Whereas a single thread conversation (like a forum) only allows for a single thread of conversation, and divergent conversations are all mixed up in the same thread.<p>With Reddit (but not HN), the ability to collapse threads makes it even easier to only follow the particular conversations you are interested in. Collapse the ones you don&#x27;t care about (like pun threads, etc.), and read the important stuff. With a single thread, you have to scan every single comment, including the junk and the stuff you don&#x27;t care about. Not to mention the whole &quot;Page 1 [2] 3 ... 389&quot; deal that single threaded conversations get into.<p>You mention chronological order being important, and most threaded sites (but not HN) have the ability to sort threads by chronological order, which gives the same single threaded &quot;top level&quot; of comments.<p>I agree with you that HN can be a chore to read, though. I think it would be massively improved were it to have a built in thread collapsing mechanism. It definitely has the least feature of threaded conversations that I&#x27;ve seen.",1394671845

Accept failure, fold the company now, return remaining investor funds and get a job.<p>B. Do whatever it takes to get profitable in the next 60 days.<p>This is a possible game plan for option B.<p>1. If you&#x27;re doing enterprise sales, your problem is likely as much about cash flow as it is revenue. Collect as much cash as you can now. Get customers paying monthly/quarterly to pay annually. Make big prospects an offer they can&#x27;t refuse to prepay in advance.<p>2. Get revenue any way you can. Become a consulting company. Do things that don&#x27;t scale. Sublet your office. Hold events at your office and sell tickets. Sell some Aeron chairs. Just get some more cash coming in.<p>3. Cut costs ruthlessly. With 2-3 months left, there is no way you should have 10-15 employees. Assume you have 3 months left to live. Do you really need all of them that badly? It will be tough and heartbreaking to let people go, but it&#x27;s better to let half go with warning than to have everyone find out they&#x27;re not getting paid a couple months down the line. Cut benefits immediately. Yes it will be tough and unfair, yes it will hurt morale, but you&#x27;re at the end of the line. Do it. 3 months of runway with 15 people could become a year of runway with 3 people.<p>4. Mine your CRM and personal network for leads. Strip mine it for whatever value it has left. From now on, everyone on the team is spending at least 30% of their time on the phone with customers. Either you get some sales, or you get some great feedback about customer pain points and problems you can use for your next effort. Stop coding. This is one problem you won&#x27;t be able to code your way out of.<p>5. Unless you have amazing revenue traction, forget about raising more money. The one thing VCs hate most is a rock that is rolling downhill. Fundraising will be a fatal distraction. Instead, go back to your bootstrapping roots and do whatever it takes to get profitable now.\nException: Your current investors may have some capital in reserve to support you. Ask them for it. If they don&#x27;t re-up, your fundraising prospects are good as dead.<p>Feel free to shoot me an email with more specifics, happy to give other advice if you think it&#x27;s useful: ilya [at] mixrank.com.",1394671771

Haskell has the advantage that any pure data structure (ie, not using mutable references, which is almost all data structures we use) can be used concurrently and atomically using IORefs and atomicModifyIORef. If you need transactional guarantees, then software transactional memory (STM) is just as easy to use. For both these situations, it&#x27;s laziness and purity that gives us these things essentially for free.<p>Of course you could create more advanced concurrent mutable structures as other languages have, but IORefs and STM get you a very long way when coupled with GHC&#x27;s extremely light weight threading and high performance IO (which is getting even better in GHC 7.8, to be released soon).<p>To learn more, Simon Marlow&#x27;s excellent book is available for free online [1] and in dead tree and eBook forms from O&#x27;Reilly.

At the same time in order to send messages to other stars powerful telescopes need to be utilized. You can&#x27;t simply build a telescope per star with a planet that is thought to contain life and broadcast all the time.<p>Thus, if civilization is not capable to monitor all of the sky at the same time with low powered telescopes and quickly point high powered telescopes when something interesting is detected, there is extremely small chance that it would be able to communicate effectively. That is retransmitting the signal to the same star is worth inherently less when compared to trying to transmit to a new star.<p>If interstellar travel is not viable, what we would want to do is transmit wikipedia[0] to all stars that could contain life. Traveling time for information would be long enough that we can&#x27;t expect confirmation or two way communication. So what you would want to do is make a really powerful telescope beaming wikipedia to one star at a time (or many telescopes transmitting to different stars). Idea is - you do not want to repeat yourself. If you sent information once, and it have not been received, you would not want to try again for a long while. That is due to the fact that chance that civilization would develop that can listen to your signals in relatively short amount of time is unlikely. So I would say that if this is logic transmitting civilization would use then a signal would not be repeated for thousands of years.<p>While writing this I though of algorithm that might work better to maximize amount of civilizations you reach. This would require a relatively stable space transmitter, or series of coordinated ground transmitters:<p>1. Pick a set of stars S that potentially can support advanced civilization and are located closely in a region of space (so you do not have to reposition telescope a lot).<p>2. Start sending signals primer signals to stars. For signal S[x], temporal difference between S[x] and S[x+1] would a set amount shorter than temporal distance between S[x-1] and S[x]. Primer signals are short and cheap, transmitting entire Wikipedia should take way longer (Weeks, months, maybe years?).<p>3. Once time between primer signals reaches some threshold start transmitting data set.<p>Idea is that this will give advanced civilization potentially listening a chance to prepare to receive full transmission, while avoiding costly repeats of big data set.<p>[0] Wikipedia is chosen as sufficiently large volume of knowledge about human civilization that we would potentially want to transmit.",1394671032

I can say that while the narrative does jump around a bit, the geologic content is fairly solid; coseismic stress changes on faults really do cause substantial changes to the stress state on faults around them, and this can lead to earthquake clusters or sequences (please don&#x27;t say &#x27;storms&#x27;).<p>This is especially clear for strike slip faults (San Andreas, N. Anatolian Fault, Xianshiuhe Fault, etc.), for a couple of reasons:<p>1) Because the displacement is in the direction of neighboring fault segments that are capable of earthquakes, the stress changes on those neighboring segments are large. On subduction zones and mid-ocean ridges (the other major plate boundary types), the major stress changes are deeper in the earth, where it is hotter and faults deform through ductile shear instead of brittle, seismic slip, so earthquakes don&#x27;t really occur there.<p>2): Major, rapidly slipping strike-slip faults are more likely to be found on land than other types of rapidly-slipping faults, so we have a much better record of this process occurring on them.  It&#x27;s a lot harder to find pre-historical/geologic records of earthquakes that occurred under the sea.  Tsunami deposits are good, and in the past 10 years study has ramped up looking for them.<p>Now, I have no idea whether such a sequence wiped out classical Hellenic civilization.

In the first few days I was cursing the borrow-checker in every way imaginable. I was comfortable with everything <i>except</i> the pointer types and their borrowing semantics.<p>After a few days, the borrowing logic really started to click and I was fighting much less with the compiler. Admittedly, I still have some fogginess about some areas (particularly the borrowing/sending semantics of closures), but I understand that there&#x27;s still some work left to be done on that before 1.0. But the point I want to stress here is that once the borrowing logic clicked, Rust became a reasonably simple language. Which is <i>really</i> important to me.<p>But, I now get to say that I just wrote quickcheck without manually freeing memory and without the use of a garbage collector. That&#x27;s pretty damn cool if I say so myself.",1394669376

Are you suggesting that people with PhDs have earned the right to be exempt from social pressure by virtue of succeeding in a graduate program?<p>Choosing some arbitrary and largely fashion-orthogonal dimension to slice up the population seems like a very reasonable way to try and advertise fashion to a wider audience. If you are decrying that the media is pigeonholing women as being more fashion-sensitive, or that they are cherry-picking some expected body type out of their chosen demographic, then that is a separate and perhaps valid issue.

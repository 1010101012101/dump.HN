For example, a country might require a lot less paperwork from companies with less than 10 employees. The same country might require a lot of extra  regulation for a company with more than 20 employees. So you might be BETTER OFF WITH <i>3 companies x 10 employees</i> than with <i>1 company x 30 employees</i>.<p>I am curious to know:<p>(1) what is the ratio of startups that grow beyond the stage of a small company in those contries.<p>(2) what is the ratio of startups which provide jobs for at least 2 other people besides the owners. I'm willing to bet that in the European ex-communist countries, the vast majority of startups are actually small shops which barelly allow a family to survive (with the only employees being husband and wife).<p>.<p>The number of startups as presented in the article doesn't really say much at all and the conclusion really was just pulled out of thin air. One could as well say <i>""Safety nets: ball and chain (You can't grow beyond startup level)""</i> without changing a single word in that article.",1326261286

3450620,comment,3449917,3449917,2,0,paisible,,,"The product look great, and piggy-backing on IRC makes a lot sense. However, I wouldn't pay for this, on the basis that the pricing model makes me feel like they assume users are naive (to put it nicely).  
Multi-tiered pricing models that work typically offer users incremental value, most often in the form of extra features (that took time to develop), support (that takes time to provide) or hardware/bandwidth resources (that are fixed costs to the company). 
In this case however, the incremental value is ""number of users"". Unless we're talking about hosting video (or other bandwidth-intensive media), the difference in resources needed to host 50 users can't warrant a 10x price difference from that of hosting 5 users.  
This is where they lose me (and probably most devs) to the ""apt-get"" alternative.
IMHO, they should apply a one-price model : 10$ per month, unlimited users. It would better bridge the gap between the DIY option, and the luxury of having someone else do a mostly one-time configuration (and occasional maintenance) for you.",1326261071

You can't express these functions elegantly if you are required to silo the .push(cb(item))-ing into a separate ""map"" or map-like function.<p>That's not an outlandish requirement; imagine that the callback can be expensive, and we would like to be able to adjust a centralized ""map"" function later so it farms things out to different processes/workers/etc.<p>To solve this for map_first_innermost, you'd have to throw an exception with the nested array, but this is just getting hideously ugly.<p><pre><code>  function map_first_innermost(arr, callback) {

It is a great choice for blogging sites where a group of editors publish content to a site in predefined channels, but really falls down if you push it too hard.<p>Template processing is slow, processing order is wonky, and it's very easy to create N+1 query loops that can only be avoided by writing custom SQL queries/php. They also made some poor database structure choices in certain areas.<p>Mostly though it just boggles the mind why they put so much effort into creating a regex-based templating system when the app is already just PHP.<p>Still, probably the best CMS I've used and it certainly has its uses. I just wouldn't use it to develop anything complicated ever again.",1326259575

But now the government has higher control of the press, by controlling the paper, it has also publicly attacked and tried to close some of our biggest media (regardless of their quality, that's a bad sign... the government arbitrarily choose to attack one monopoly very openly, while allowing other monopolies to continue as always), while it has funded their own partidist media -with our taxes-. Meanwhile we have seen violent, even physical attacks against people who talk openly against the Kirchnerismo, like Lanata (I'm not saying the government did these attacks, but they weren't as common before the Kirchnerismo).<p>If Clarin is like Fox News: what would happen if the POTUS decided to close Fox News, just because? The end result wouldn't be more freedom of speech.<p>I don't think the Kirchner did all wrong, but I do really think our freedom of expression is getting smaller every year with them.",1326259563

In most C code we're carrying around either a null terminator (which can get clobbered) or a whole integer for the size.<p>Instead, there should be a way to ask the OS ""how big is the crap this pointer is pointed at"" and get a valid answer.  Other useful things would be ""how far inside the chunk pointed at by X is the pointer Y?"" Or, ""will pointing Y at J inside X cause an error?""<p>And it wouldn't even need to be the OS, just the allocator, probably a few macros, etc.  But, for now I have to show people how to write bug resistant C code so this is the best way so far.",1326259278

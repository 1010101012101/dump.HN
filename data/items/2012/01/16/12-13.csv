You can eat $4 noodles or $400 dollar steak. Booze is too expensive. Public transport is cheap, comfortable and mostly efficient (until a couple of recent train breakdowns).<p>It's also a great base for traveling Asia.<p>From a startup perspective, a huge amount of emphasis (read: money) is currently being applied to regional entrepreneurs to base themselves in Singapore's low-tax, straightforward business environment.<p>Engineers have been slightly underpaid historically, but things are beginning to improve. Coupled with the low tax rate though... the main problem is expensive rental accommodation.<p>The government certainly is guilty of heavy-handed-ness in a variety of situations but in general it appears to be from a sense of egocentric paternalism ('we know best what is good for you') rather than cynical exploitation.<p>They currently have some issues in terms of redistributing the wealth fairly to locals.

It's a rich city with a powerful political establishment that uses some levers of power that are taboo in North America. But there's an elected parliament, a non-corrupt bureaucracy, and a respected legal system derived from English law.

3470421,comment,3469453,3469660,8,0,willyt,,,"I've noticed this with my comments too. My hypothesis is that if a person wants to optimise comments for upvotes, they need to be quick one liners because the discussion and therefore the eyeballs move on very quickly. If you write a high quality comment it takes time but less people read it because the top of the bell curve of the huge wave of eyeballs following the stream of the discussion has passed it by.<p>Humans are social, we have a need for acknowledgment from our peers so we can measure or opinions against others and to help develop our thinking on a particular point. As you suggest above, karma points are a crude replacement for the nods of agreement that you would get in a face to face conversation that signify that you or I are saying something interesting. It's a not a nice feeling to think you are saying something interesting only to find you are talking to yourself. Therefore, there is a strong incentive towards pithy one line comments that get seen quickly and appeal to the masses.<p>The trouble with karma points is there is no differentiation between the nods you get in drunken agreement from your friends when you say something funny in a bar and the nods you get from your colleagues when you say something insightful. We would value these differently in a face to face situation. On the internet it's just a competition for generic human recongition points where the short fast comments that 'press peoples buttons' are at an advantage.<p>The trouble with pithy one line comments that press peoples buttons is that they are hard to get right, not many people can strike the right balance. What's meant to be a pithy one liner actually just ends up saying nothing, something offensive, illogical or merely just voicing tribal agreement with Apple or Google or whatever.<p>Maybe it would be better to be able to see other peoples upvotes but not out own? What about a mandatory 1 hour before a comment appears, perhaps just display a '...' to signify that someone is preparing an answer? I don't know what the answer is, but I also miss the more challenging technical articles.",1326717162

When I made it, there were no negative comments on the story, and it was really just intended to question the ""programmer prodigy"" aspect, not to criticise the deceased or imply that she was not an impressive young person.<p>I hate (!) to discard any part of the english language; I think all expressions have their place, including ""I hate to be that guy, but"" - however, in hindsight, the net effect was to lump my relatively neutral comment in with all the haters on the thread, so, in practice, it was proven to be a poor choice.<p>That said, I do dislike the habit of idolising deceased people as perfect in every way. It reminds me of the ""HN Salesmanship hero"" story (where I commented that he wasn't my hero and I resented this attribution, for which I got badly downvoted). This person was clearly impressive without making stuff up about them. From all the comments and interviews, it in fact seems that her programming ability, far from being prodigy-like, was in fact the least impressive of her other personal traits.<p>To conclude: had I known that there would be a pile-up of hateful belittling following my comment, I wouldn't have made it, or if I felt the need to ask that question, I would have done so in a much more carefully phrased way.

The comments are full of thoughtful and well reasoned discussions between the readers. Sure, there are problems: sometimes someone posts something that's mean spirited, or there's a few too many one liners in the comments thread, but, on the whole, these problems are rare.<p>In fact, the quality of the comments are so high that there's even an Ask Metafilter sub-section, where readers post, often very personal, questions and do so without fear of the kind of reaction they'll get.<p>What's most interesting about the Metafilter model is that there's no up- or down-voting, only favouriting.<p>So how do they ensure the quality of the comments?

Taken to the extreme, it sounds like a dry exchange of scientific papers in comment form: ""here's my thesis on this, here's my counter-thesis to your thesis"".<p>For one, all these criteria are highly subjective. One's ""useful and original"" thought could be an idiotic triviality for another.<p>Case in point, the ""utility of single-use objects"". Personally, I don't need anyone to point that utility out to me: I use forks, socks and shaving foam too. And if someone <i>did</i> want to prove the utility of single-use objects to me, a wrist-watch would be a <i>bad example</i>, if he adds that he still carries a smartphone.<p>That's just one example to show the subjectivity of the notion of ""useful and original thoughts"".<p>Want another? Hacker News had for 2+ days a front-page full of articles regarding Steve Jobs. I don't mind, this is what the community voted it wants to see. But does it bode well with the ""death to unoriginal/useless content"" idea, people seem to want to enforce to HN at the same time?<p>Before you take it to the comments, have you checked the front page top voted articles? A random example (#2): ""Switching Sol Trader from Ruby to C++: one week on"".<p>Is this what is considered a useful, original and non-standard submission? Because it sounds like JavaLobby or WebMonkey circa 2000.<p>#11 Startups: Don't Host Your Blog on Tumblr, #3 Login to your Google account by scanning a QR code, #5 AWS Free Usage Tier now Includes Microsoft Windows on EC2 #18 Startup will wash your car wherever it is located,<p>There is better stuff, but you have to hack your way with a machete.<p>= = = = =<p>Now, in the context of a thread, someone has three ways to react when met with something he doesn't like: upvote, downvote and answering.<p>I tend to answer to comments that I find wrong. I also find that it does not take a full-length essay to prove a weak point. Sometimes you only need a line or two. And sometimes you have to state something unoriginal, if only because you reply to something unoriginal.<p>A comment like ""Python's whitespace made programmers avoid it in droves"", does not merit a full response, with the whitespace Dijkstra quote and links to the TIOBE index. If you think it does, then you probably have a flawed concept of ""discussion"" and/or are unpopular at parties.<p>A proper discussion should have a balance between interesting observations, arguments, counterpoints, nods of agreement, nods of disagreement, and some light stuff thrown in for good measure. And sometimes a plain ""what you wrote just doesn't make sense"", is needed too, if only to put bizarro ideas in perspective.<p>= = = = =<p>I find the below excerpt problematic:<p>""""""<i>But Internet comments tend to degrade as a website grows; it attracts more people who just comment, often in ways that arent negative enough to silence through moderation but still annoying enough to lower the quality of the conversation</i>.""""""<p>""<i>Lower the quality of the conversation</i>"" by whose standards?<p>Because, if anger against such ""lowering of the quality"" is not measured by downvotes or negative responses, then the only quality you are alluding to is in your head.<p>And it's especially ironic to invoke something like the ""Dunning-Kruger effect"", whereas ""<i>the people who are least likely to provide valuable and non-jerky comments are also least likely to realize theyre not doing it</i>"".<p>The Dunning-Kruger effect is a <i></i>double-edge sword<i></i>, it's not a free pass to imply ""<i>my stuff is golden, yours sucks and you don't even know it</i>"".<p>[Thanks for your downvotes.

3470361,comment,3469453,3469453,15,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"One of the things I've learned on HN is that if a comment can be misunderstood, it will be. So if you post insightful, brief comment A, you can count on getting replies B,C,E,E, and F that completely miss the point.<p>This leads me to believe that some -- perhaps not the majority, but some -- of the comments here that we consider snarky or noise might actually be pretty good comments, we just misread them. And then respond.<p>In my own experience I have found when I am tired or not mentally functioning very well I tend to misread the intention of comments. Assuming this holds true in the larger community, there may not be a way to fix the extra problem I bring up. Or any of these related problems, for that matter.<p>I mention that to say this: <i>the community can only go so far talking about a topic in any direction without a lot of emotional push-back starting up, and emotions win over logic</i>. So if the subject is ""businesses that sell to poor people,"" at some point, somebody is going to start making a case that businesses shouldn't be allowed to ""exploit"" poor people. Those folks are not being snarky; to them they are simply making a stand that needs to be made when the subject has gone off the rails. Likewise, if the subject is ""writing your own OS to make a fortune,"" at some point somebody is going to start beating the F/OSS drums. If somebody posts yet another ""Young inventor conquers known universe"" stories, somebody is going to point out the trope.<p>These folks are not trying to be snarky or trolling. They are simply trying to provide useful feedback. But comments like this have a tendency to snowball. Once you let one comment in that says something like ""enough with the young kid inventor stories that are overhyped!"" then the next commenter feels like he has to out-do the first. And a lousy thread is born. If you do not let these comments in, then you are saying you want a board where people must react to content in a completely non-emotional fashion. That's not going to work either. In the terrible example of the deceased programmer, probably 2 or 3 percent of the audience did not feel sympathy for the story. Out of that bunch, maybe only 2 or 3 percent felt the need (?) to express criticism. But in a community the size of HN, that's enough. Once those comments were put out, the rest of those folks who felt little sympathy were empowered to go along with the thread, drawing in fence-sitters in the process. After all, they were simply being dispassionate! That's what we ask for when we deride most bad comments, right?<p>All abstractions are leaky, and language is very slippery. With tens of thousands of readers, written comments and articles simply are too leaky to scale.<p>So we have yet another terrible example of HNers performing poorly. I don't have an answer. What we see is mob behavior at work, the human social animal. Written communication is much different than vocal communication, but we naturally try to use them both the same way. We are performing as designed. It's probably a feature, not a bug. :)<p>EDIT: Please don't take this as an apologia for poor commenting or what happened yesterday, just my attempt at explanation. One of the worst comments I ever made was in reply to a long-time HN'er who was basically asking ""Why are you loading up my HN feed with this useless obituary crap?"" when somebody posted about a somewhat famous person passing away. I told them to shut their pie-hole. And I'd write that comment again in a heartbeat.",1326715562

And THAT is how the computer works 'under the hood'.<p>While what you say about Assembly is true, there's more to computer internals than doing arithmetic and control flow in the CPU. Virtual memory, DMA and IO are equally important, and the code that deals with that stuff is usually C code.<p>> > Learning C is almost mandatory if you want to see how deep the rabbit hole is.\n> Not really. I know what is going on 'down there', regardless of which language was used to compile the machine code. What is REALLY useful is to have really succinct, powerful, high-level abstractions to build software quickly and with as little code as possible.<p>You can book-learn what's going on under the hood but that's no replacement for getting your hands dirty. If you want to actually write code that uses memory and pointers (e.g. memory mapped files), runs in kernel mode or twiddles with page tables and virtual memory, C is the best language you can do it with.<p>> I think if you want to understand what's going on 'down there' in the 'rabbit hole', learn assembly language.<p>Learning Assembly language(s) is a very useful skill for everyone. But doing anything practical with Assembly is a futile effort, it's best to stick to C in low level stuff and resort to Assembly only when you absolutely have to. For example when you have to change between processor modes or write an interrupt handler routing, there must be some (inline) Assembly involved. But if you want to get stuff done and work with the interesting stuff, going all-assembly is not worth the effort.<p>I wrote a tiny multitasking operating system in Assembly. While it worked very well initially, as soon as the complexity went above one screenful of assembly, it started becoming very unwieldy. I moved on to C and got more stuff done. I could focus on the interesting stuff like scheduling algorithms and virtual memory when I didn't have the mental overhead of having to make register allocations manually or whipping up my own control structures.",1326715517

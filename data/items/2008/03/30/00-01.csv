But my hedge fund friends usually work a pretty standard 9 hour day, 5 days a week (well, occasionally they'll be researching financials on a weekend, but it's because that's what they like to do).  And they take pretty frequent vacations.<p>There's an element of risk-transference in the high financial industry salaries.  When times are good, lots of money flows into the financial industry, which props up salaries.  When times are bad, firms go under, people get laid off, and salaries drop.  However, the loss is never <i>entirely</i> born by the employees - after all, somebody out there lost all their principal because Bear Stearns imploded.  So on average, Wall Street employees will make more than people in steadier, more risk-free jobs.<p>Same goes for entrepreneurs, for that matter.  If the company does well, they get multi-million-$ payouts.  If the company folds, their investors bear part of the loss.  So on average (mean), an entrepreneur will do better than an equivalent employee, even though on average (median), the entrepreneur ends up with nothing.",1206838453
149786,comment,147124,147449,0,0,gregjor,,,"All of the products you list are variations of the original multivalued database designed by Dick Pick. These are often referred to as Pick- or Pick-style databases. Back in the 1970s and early 1980s there were several large vendors selling computers and operating systems based on the Pick database complete with a dialect of BASIC with the database functionality embedded. All of those companies went out of business a few years after the first commercial relational databases arrived on the market: Prime Computer, Microdata, Ultimate (owned by Honeywell), and a few others. IBM bought the most popular Pick clone, Universe, and renamed it U2. Raining Data is the result of a merger between what was left of Dick Pick's company and another non-relational desktop database, Omnis. jBase is yet another Pick clone.<p>I worked as a Pick consultant in the 1980s, mainly on Prime/Information systems. Now when I run into Pick databases still in use they are always undergoing or slated for replacement. The replacement is always a modern commercial RDBMS such as Oracle or MS SQL Server.<p>Technically Pick-style multivalued databases are not relational, but they can be made to act more or less like a relational database. The most important difference is the support for multivalued fields. Originally multivalued fields were the big selling point, and the Pick database engine is built around nested multivalued lists (a very different internal organization compared to, say, Oracle). Multivalues of course violate First Normal Form; a relation that includes a multivalued attribute cannot be said to be normalizable.<p>Pick-style multivalued databases violate the relational model (the model based on sets and predicate logic) in other ways that I won't get into; Chris Date and Fabian Pascal have written at some length on the subject.<p>That isn't to say this database model is useless or wrong, just that it isn't relational in a strict sense. I've written and worked on large applications built on the Pick database and, while I would not choose those tools today, they are certainly powerful and flexible enough to build real applications on. The flexibility Pick adherents enjoy has a dark side in that data integrity must, for the most part, be enforced in application code; Pick-style databases are especially prone to dangling keys and type mismatches. Pick-style database programming requires the application programmer to lock records (rows) explicitly; support for ACID-compliant transactions are non-existent or afterthought bolt-ons. Those can be pretty big problems for modern application architectures where the client and server are not running on the same minicomputer (a la Microdata and Prime).<p>Building a single application with a multivalued database can be ""fluid and flexible"" and maybe even faster than starting with a true relational database, but when multiple applications have to share a multivalued database and the integrity rules are therefore scattered across application domains and code things can get messy pretty fast. Anyone who has spent time migrating Pick applications to any other platforms knows how easily the mix of business logic and database manipulation in the same piece of code makes for a big bowl of spaghetti.",1206838409

They will usually allow you to complete all the coursework and get feedback as part of the auditing arrangement.  Getting caught attending lectures without being enrolled can have implications beyond just being kicked out...you're essentially ""stealing"" an education.  They can charge you with theft or criminal trespass.  As someone who has a criminal record for trespassing, I'd advise you to just enroll in any course you really want to attend ;-)",1206838277

149777,comment,149649,149681,0,0,boucher,,,"My co-founder and I took a seminar on entrepreneurship offered jointly between the engineering and business schools at USC.  It was actually pretty similar to YCombinator dinners -- every week someone (occasionally multiple people) came in to talk about their own experiences as an entrepreneur, answer questions. etc.  Unfortunately, unlike YC, it was at 7:30 in the morning, which was tough.<p>It wasn't focused on software, or any one field at all actually, so there was a really wide range of speakers.  I have a hard time remembering many of the individuals, but a lot of the overall lessons have stuck with me I think.  I have a long set of notes I should really look over, I'm sure their are things that would come in handy right now.",1206837653

149768,comment,149052,149457,0,0,murrayh,,,"I don't think that undermining the speaker is a valid way of arguing. It is irrelevant who states the argument; an argument is as equally as strong whoever makes it. I can copy and paste another's argument verbatim, and then change all the ""I"" references to ""person X"" references, and the argument would be identical.<p>What you can do is refute evidence. So if the speaker presents one of their own claims as evidence, you can sometimes invalidate that claim by undermining the speaker's pathos and ethos.<p>NOTE: When I say valid, I mean it in terms of determining what is correct, not what convinces people.",1206836811

I've put a substantial amount of work into developing a Flash game and have discovered, as I follow the market, that a lot of games are incompatible across different versions of the plugin. Fonts go missing, graphics features behave with different levels of performance, and worst of all, on some versions of the plugin, errors that elsewhere went ignored cause exceptions and terminate execution, resulting in the game becoming wholly unplayable.<p>I've also discovered a way to consistently crash the Linux plugin.<p>I'm hoping for either a suitable, market-accepted replacement to come along, or for an emulation like Gnash to get up to speed with the newest versions of SWF.",1206836353

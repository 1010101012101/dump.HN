The point of captcha's isn't that they are unbreakable, the point is that you want to raise the transaction cost above zero for creating a new account.<p>Spammers rely on massive accounts/contacts and get a very small return.  Let's say you need to send out ten million e-mails to get a single response, and maybe you can get ten thousand e-mails out of an account before it's banned.  If the cost of creating a new account is zero, or limited by zero, then it doesn't matter if you have to create 10, 20, 100, or even 1,000 new accounts to get the e-mails out so you can get one response and make a 5 dollar commission.  If you can automate that hell out of it, who cares.<p>On the other hand if it costs you 5 cents to break every captcha, those costs really add up in the aggregate, but the transaction cost is so low for a single use that it really is almost inconsequential.<p>So as with all security, it's not about making it ""unbreakable"", it's about raising the transaction cost high enough to make it less attractive or even unprofitable to circumvent it.",1232314375

439701,comment,438936,439382,0,0,walterk,,,"Thanks for pointing this out. I suspect there may be something genuinely broken with my downvoting, though, because despite having only upvoted for a good while, my downvotes continue to not count.<p>Alternatively, HN is keeping a backlog of my uncounted downvotes, and counting them in order as I make more upvotes. Thus, as long as there's a backlog, any new downvote I make will initially not count.<p>Personally, I think the >=0 net karma rule goes too far. I've tended to downvote more than I upvote because I drift towards policing behavior (not ""grumpness"": not all people who downvote more than they upvote can be classified as grumps, which is a highly subjective notion anyway), and generally have high standards for what I consider worthy of an upvote. Social moderation systems have to account for the variety of sociological roles. Not to mention, the net karma of the <i>site</i> may be negative, but a >=0 rule will never allow this state to be represented.<p>It is also impossible to determine what my net karma contribution is, and thus that the >=0 rule is even in effect. Net karma contribution should appear on a user's profile page, or at the top menu bar. I shouldn't be expected to track my karma contribution manually.",1232314094

From your Google Books links:<p><i>How great the just perceptible change can be made to become by making the rate of change extremely slow is a matter that still remains for investigation. It is worthy of note that it has been found possible in 5.25 hours to crush a frog's foot, without a sign that the pressure was felt, by screwing down a button at the rate of 0.03 mm per minute.  A similar experiment showed that a live frog can actually be boiled without a movement if the water is heated slowly enough; in one experiment the temperature was raised at the rate of 0.002 Celsius per second, and the frog was found dead at the end of 2.5 hours without having moved.(1) If a frog can be crushed or boiled without any evidence that he has noticed it, it is at least an interesting question of what can be accomplished in this direction with human beings.<p>(1) The literature on these experiments with frogs includes Heinzmann,</i> Euber die Wirkung sehr allmaliger Aenderungen thermischer Reize auf die Empfindungsnerven, <i>""Archiv f. d. ges.

Especially these days, ""technical skills"" is such a vague term that it can really be applied to anything.<p>You don't need to have a complete understanding of some silly framework or whatever in order to still be considered an excellent developer in many ways. For example, you could write a stunningly elegant and clever mathematical algorithm in C without using a function more complex than sqrt(). (Or maybe you could write a more efficient sqrt!)<p>I think that learning something like that might improve your understanding of machines and could, indirectly, improve your understanding of ""web apps and services""â€”that is, understanding HTTP, statelessness, and so forth.<p>tl;dr Figure out exactly what it is you want.",1261933020

They should try addressing that before restricting in-flight entertainment and toilet breaks.<p>I actually caught a flight back from Schiphol to Heathrow last week. Heathrow's security on the flight there was annoyingly thorough as usual (shoes off, belts off, laptops out, liquids in a clear bag with 100ml limit... none of which would have helped this case!). The Dutch security was different: hand luggage through the scanner, no special treatment for laptops, liquids or shoes - much more agreeable. Then they put you through a ""security scan"", one of these new millimetre wave scanners that are supposed to detect items strapped to the body - like drugs and guns. I've been wondering did Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab have the PETN strapped in his underpants, and the fancy new security scan failed to pick it up?

It seems you are interested in the former, in which case I would recommend learning a popular framework (Ruby on Rails or Django).  While you are learning a framework you'll pick up the base language just fine.<p>If you'd like to learn the more general craft of programming, Peter Norvig has some excellent advice: <a href=""http://norvig.com/21-days.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/21-days.html</a>.

At least have an opinion! Otherwise you end up with aimless and impotent discussion. That, more than anything, seems to be what kills sites like this. People start spending their energy talking about the one thing which is not new to any of them and equally familiar to all of them, not because it's so very important, but because it's <i>so easy</i> to. Sure, community standards are important, but discussing them without the power to enforce them or the will to drive them one way or the other doesn't do much for the site.",1261931120

Why should the tax I pay on a new computer vary based on how it is delivered to my home?  Also, a sales tax is probably the fairest known model of taxation and is least susceptible to manipulation.  To further the ""Amazon should tax"" argument, one could also make the case that the sales tax becomes quite regressive when upper-income people shop online but poor people (because they don't have credit cards, etc.) primarily buy from a local store.<p>Certainly, Amazon must resist collecting sales taxes until all online/catalog retailers are required to collect them -- anything less would lead to a shareholder revolt.",1261931059

How much of the apparent recovery is based on stimulus/deficit spending?<p>I hope the answer is ""not much"", but I'm afraid the answer is ""a lot"".  Banks are sitting on reserves, not lending.

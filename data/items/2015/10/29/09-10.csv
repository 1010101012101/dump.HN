No sane person is against people having health insurance, its just the ways companies might get around this law that is the problem. For instance, lets say this applies to fulltime employees, well then the company might lay people off, hire more contractors and part-timers, then those same people have less job security, perhaps lower wages because other laws regarding fulltime employees dont apply, and still no health insurance.<p>That is essentially what this EU law boils down to: a law with lots of loophole room for companies to exploit.",1446112749

10469997,comment,10463464,10467350,0,0,pron,,,"Assume you have language with a generic type List<T>, and an instance, v, of the type List<Integer>. Can you then pass that value to a method expecting a List<Number> (assuming Number is a supertype of Integer)? Well, that depends on the variance rules of the language and the runtime. On the JVM, any type is checked both at compile time and at runtime. Erased generics, though, mean that the runtime type of v is just List, while reified generics mean that its List<Integer>. When a type is reified -- namely, its full type information is available at runtime -- the runtime needs to know the relationship between any two types: does one extend the other or are the unrelated? But with generics and variance, there is no &quot;best way&quot; to do variance and different languages may choose different variance models. Because the runtime has to know what is the relationship between any two types, the v variable has to know, at runtime, whether it is also an instance of List<Number> or not. This means that the same generic classes cannot be shared among different languages with reified generics, if they have different variance rules, because the language&#x27;s decision is baked into the compiled class. That&#x27;s what I meant in my comment. Languages on a JVM shouldn&#x27;t have reified generics because then they may not play well with others.<p>With Ceylon, the issue is different, because the JVM -- unlike the CLR -- doesn&#x27;t have a standard way of specifying reified generics (and that&#x27;s a good thing, IMO, because of the &quot;baked-in variance problem&quot;). However, that means that none of the standard Java generic classes are first-class citizens in Ceylon world, because they don&#x27;t have the reified runtime type information. This isn&#x27;t a problem for Ceylon because one of its stated goals (it says so right on their website) is to replace the Java standard libraries, so this incongruence doesn&#x27;t even matter to them because a Ceylon List and a Java List are not even the same type to begin with. That a Java list instance does not have a reified generic type in Ceylon is, therefore, not a problem for them, because Ceylon didn&#x27;t set out to make the existing classes first-class citizens of its brand-new ecosystem.<p>This is why I and the Ceylon guys have this misunderstanding. They think I&#x27;m saying Ceylon has a problem, but I&#x27;m not. Ceylon has certain core design goals that may be what some people want but not others, that is all. But those design decisions do have ramifications.<p>BTW, the &quot;baked-in variance&quot; problem will not get introduced into the JVM with the addition of specialized generics for value types in Java 10, because value types can&#x27;t extend other types, and so a List<int> can&#x27;t also be a list of any supertype (or subtype).",1446112531

In the US what does that mean, 3 months of picking litter by the road in an orange jumpsuit? Or does it mean that he can work for the prosecutors office for free for that time (obviously, he has a lot of experience there)<p>He also lost his law licence. What does that mean, how old was the guy? I don&#x27;t know how it works in the US but if it effectively means forced retirement then he will be on a reduced pension, and moreover can&#x27;t go for any cushy positions normally available for a retired prosecutor.<p>This also showed that judges ought to be asking this question of prosecutors.. I wonder if the defence can ask this question in the court and ask for similar sanctions if it were proved later that the prosecutor knew something they didn&#x27;t disclose.<p>I wonder what has he been doing in the two years since this article was written?",1446111528

Which I agree with, considering the variables they were interested in measuring.<p>Excerpts from the setup:<p><i>Groups had to submit a written proposal stating how they would use the grant for non-agricultural skills training and enterprise start-up costs. [...] The central government asked district governments to nominate 2.5 times the number of groups they could fund. [...] Successful proposals [note: randomized] received a large lump sum cash transfer [...] with no government monitoring thereafter.</i><p>Excerpts from the conclusions:<p><i>These results show that cash grants to groups of young people who develop business plans have large and persistent impacts in moving underemployed into non-agricultural jobs, increasing earnings and work hours. [...] In the end, YOP appears to have reached a group of motivated, able young people, who on average were neither exceptionally poor nor uneducated relative to their peers, in an economy with little financial depth but bouncing back from civil strife. Our conceptual framework suggests this is exactly the group to benefit from a windfall.</i>",1446109610

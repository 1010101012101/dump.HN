36123,comment,36117,36117,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"The approach that works best for me is to just start building it :).<p>In all seriousness though, this is truly the case.  I surmise that most of us already have a platform of choice.  I know I do.  So once that is taken care of, just go ahead and start.<p>In terms of how do you start, I think it is most effective to work on the critical functionality path.  Just do everything that is absolutely critical to make it functional.  <p>In terms of where do you start along the critical functionality path, I approach it from the user perspective.  First I need the login screen or whatever.  OK, I need to build the ability to login.  Then the next thing the user is going to want to do is X, so I need to make X work.<p>With this process you get from nothing to something functional in little time, and then you can just build from there.  I have been on projects where we talk it through first, and even spec, but in my experience this is a waste of time for small projects at all but the highest level.  Almost immediately when you start building it you notice things you didn't in the talking stage.<p>I'm interested in what other people do, but this has always worked for me.  Of course, I like to work alone :).  But it has worked with other people too.  You just break up critical functional tasks the way they naturally break up.",1185206810

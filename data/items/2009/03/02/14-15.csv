But the page at the end of the link is hilariously awful:<p><i>Your university's subscription to this Journal has just become even better value!</i><p>Notice the complete lack of useful facilities for the general public -- and just about everybody else, for that matter. I can't even find a browseable homepage of the latest issue of this journal. There's a search box that I can type in, but I can't find a recent reference to the only scientist mentioned in the news article. When I do click on a random paper from the journal I can't read it unless I buy it, and I can't buy it or even see the price without registering.<p>They say expressing anger is good for your career. So let me advance my career by noting that the existing for-pay scientific publishing industry is a collection of hopelessly-obsolete parasitic middlemen that actively harms science education by keeping primary sources out of sight of the public, and that we should all lobby to have our government's tax-supported research grants come with a requirement to publish in open-access journals:<p><a href=""http://www.plos.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plos.org/</a>",1236005540

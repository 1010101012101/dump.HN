Not many people have that kind of time to spare.</i><p>I think that as electric cars become more mainstream, people would be willing to make adjustments to their lifestyle to accommodate charging times.  I think that over the next 10 years there could come a point where case reaches a threshold and charging time decreases enough  where the scales tip in favor of electric.  I'm not sure where it is, but there has to be some point on the continuum where people say ""let the car charge for an hour while we eat at Denny's rather than paying $6-7/gallon.",1360648795

The earthquake sensor feeds are often scrubbed of non-earthquake sources; ever wonder how they do that?<p>There is a possibility that it is a chemical explosion, if you are willing to swallow the idea that the North Koreans detonated <i>several million kilos</i> of military high explosives in a mine shaft somewhere. But even then, while the signature is closer to a nuclear explosion it is not identical. Maybe the seismic data from a variety of sources is damaged or defective but I'm not counting on it.<p>Have you considered the possibility that you are the one over-reacting? Our ability to classify seismic motion is much more sophisticated than you seem to be assuming. It is the same reason they can tell whether an earthquake swarm in a particular spot is caused by local fault activity or the imminent emergence of a volcano -- the signature is different. There is a lot more to analyzing seismic activity than just the magnitude. It is also how we do subsurface imaging for mining oil. It is a mathematically sophisticated field, give it some respect.",1360645868

I think less about what marketers want and how desperate it may or may not be, and I spend more time feeling offended that someone is presuming to intrude into my personal space in my program on my machine and tell me how <i>I</i> plan to use it. It's like they're misrepresenting me to myself, and it never fails to provoke much scoffing and eyerolling from me. I consider it a major signal of BS in software.<p>On the other hand, software which uses ""your"" or no pronouns at all can do almost exactly the same stuff - like creating a default organization of data - and I don't mind. I see it as a respectful suggestion which has my best interest in mind, and I'm more likely to actually incorporate their idea into the way I do things because I'm not immediately on the defensive.<p>Edit:<p>This reminds me of when I was staying at one of those tropical beach resorts and one of the souvenir sellers was announcing ""shopping time, everybody!"" to everyone that passed by. I didn't like that he obviously wanted me to participate in a dishonest exchange, but he was presumptuously ""reminding"" me that giving giving him money is a natural part of my day, the same way that I have an ""eating time"" and a ""sleeping time"".",1360645209

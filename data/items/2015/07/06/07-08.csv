Greece is a country, not a person. Did all Greeks benefit equally from that money? Or is large amounts of it sitting in accounts of corrupt politicians and the corporations (not necessarily Greek ones) that the money got spent on.<p>I&#x27;ve seen accusations that the high military spending goes to northern European arms dealing countries. I have no idea if that&#x27;s true but the pattern is very familiar, the UK have a long history of giving &quot;foreign&quot; &quot;aid&quot; which is basically giving taxpayer money to arms dealers.",1436169575

9837517,comment,9836991,9837297,0,0,jevgeni,,,"You are talking about historical consistency. What the European establishment needs is political consistency. The Baltic states, as well as Spain, Portugal, and Ireland did go through varying degrees of austerity. If you start treating one member differently, right after other members went through difficult reforms, why should other members then play ball? And that is false reasoning: does this mean that any country can wage war and racial extermination and then be forgiven, because Germany already was?<p>Regarding the bailout thing. A bailout is, per definition, paying off the creditors (banks in this case). The reason people do it <i>at all</i> is to keep the confidence of the money market. Greece wouldn&#x27;t need a bailout if they were planning to stop taking on any debt at all. But they aren&#x27;t.<p>To answer your question, if the banks would take the hit, then it would hurt private households. People think of banks as some super dodgy prop hedge funds, that use their own money to reap super profits. They don&#x27;t. Banks invest the money of their clients and bag any difference between the interest rate they&#x27;ve offered and the interest rate they&#x27;ve earned. So again, the hit would go to pension funds and possibly depositors. Now, what kind of political climate would be in Europe, if say a German pensioner suddenly got less, because the Greeks couldn&#x27;t pay back?",1436169523

9837493,story,,,27,48,hamoudi,"Ask HN: I want to become an evangelist, how do I go about it?",,"So to give you a little insight into myself. I am a recent graduate BS Application Development student. Even before I graduated, I was signed away to a great company. I applied to become an Android Developer, because while studying it was a field I showed intrest in. During my internship I fell in love with web technology. My company was just starting a web-unit, since it was primarily focused on app-development in the past (mainly iOS). I was grateful to be in a position where I could make the shift to something I felt more passionate about. When I graduated I started taking on way too many commitments simultaneously. Trying to stick my hand in as many cookie-jars as possible trying to make money as fast as possible. I want to accomplish and so little time. I&#x27;m 22 and I feel if I don&#x27;t hit it big within the next 2 years I probably won&#x27;t. Eventually I dropped everything. After which I asked myself one important question: Where do I want to be in 5 years? I am a good developer, I am valued at my work as a developer. However I know I&#x27;ll never be a great developer, not to be harsh on myself. But I do the google code-jams and what-not and 15 year olds can beat me straight. I have no great mind. I&#x27;m smart and tech-savvy and I learn quick, but I am no genius. Before becoming a developer I was a field-marketeer for 2 years selling electronics in stores as a way to make money while studying. My last year I got hired by Microsoft to exclusively sell their products and be a one-stop knowledge base in stores. I loved it, people came to me and I knew how to help them. Seeing that light go on in someones eyes when they understood something was beautiful. Given 90% of the time the clients were tech-handicap, but still. I want to pursue something on the developer-scale that combines both. I know it takes years of experience to become an evangelist. My question is: How do you start? What do you do?\nMaybe there are evangelists out there that can give me some tips.",1436169122

Since private households tend to save (and we should consider that a good thing, given how available savings is an essential part of freedom within a capitalist system), the debts have to be somewhere else. They could be debts of firms (for investment), but the private sector is exposed to (sometimes severe) economic fluctuations.

Going back to the metaphor, assume everyone else believes their money is safely locked away and their account information secure. At this point, you tell the bank that they have this problem. Don&#x27;t you also have a moral obligation to tell the public they are not as safe as they thought they were?

Those who live in countries where gun rights are strong tend to favor gun rights.  Those who live in countries where gun control is strong tend to favor gun control.   This is true of most things, as the moral compasses of most are drawn from what is currently normative to their existing environment.  This is true of most places in which socio-political biases are codified into law, whether regarding religion, gay rights, whatever; Change in these areas tends to come slowly if at all.<p>> guns should be regulated further<p>Perhaps they should, perhaps they shouldn&#x27;t.  I have my bias, as I&#x27;m sure does everyone engaged in the discussion, but, at the end of the day, the document of the highest possible authority suggests that the citizenry should have access to guns, and the only way to overturn that is by ratifying that document.  Thankfully, the document itself offers prescriptive measures for such ratification, but at the end of the day, without a strong enough amount of support throughout the nation and states for such a measure to pass.<p>At present, such support does not exist, so our politicians play different games on what does or does not constitute &quot;infringement&quot;.<p>In the past, the argument was that it wasn&#x27;t infringing if the person who wanted to exercise gun rights wasn&#x27;t a member of a militia.  We can prove historically and grammatically that this isn&#x27;t true, but it took the Supreme Court&#x27;s agreement for the legislature to accept it.<p>Then, the argument was that sure, it&#x27;s an individual right and not limited to those in the militia, but hey, the second amendment says you can keep and bear arms, but it doesn&#x27;t say where, so instead, the government insists that the right is only applicable to within the home.  Have as many guns as you like, and carry them anywhere you want, as long as it&#x27;s inside your home.<p>It took Chicago v. McDonald getting that one overturned in 2012 by the Supreme Court.<p>So, legally speaking, we know that the right to keep and bear arms is an individual right, disconnected from membership in a militia, and it extends outside the home.  To those who favor gun rights, the matter might settled, but to those who favor gun control, it&#x27;s a challenge to come up with a new rule that doesn&#x27;t directly contradict those recently affirmed rules by the Supreme Court.<p>In D.C., the argument is currently that the right to keep and bear arms is only available to those with a heightened need... but what other right in our Constitution merits such a high bar to exercise?  Would it be okay to restrict voting only to those harmed by the current administration?  Would it be okay to limit speech only to those who can show that they have been victimized?<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m obviously ranting, and there&#x27;s certainly more of my bias in this post than I intended, so I should shut up.  The point, that I&#x27;m sure I made poorly, is that the law here says that we can have firearms, and that not even the elected legislature has the power to overturn that without ratifying the Constitution... unless they can come up with something legally clever, or wait until there exists a more favorable court to their cause.",1436168060

Using an altcoin would just be annoying and a lot fewer people would want to use the system.<p>But is that really true? The overwhelming number of users that would participate (at reddit&#x27;s scale or a couple of magnitudes less) have 1) never heard of bitcoin, 2) dont own bitcoin, 3) think its scammy or for buying drugs. Almost all of the potential users would have to purchase bitcoin just to participate. The only people that would be annoyed by using an altcoin are the ones that currently own bitcoin and would not receive a benefit from an increase in value.<p>Lets be real. This type of application could definitely be developed with some sort of decentralized/p2p token system where tokens are earned, posts are paid for them and maybe the tokens gain some sort of value, but it doesnt require bitcoin. It could literally just be pebbles picked up off the ground if enough people believe that that is correct.

9837335,comment,9830486,9833076,0,0,BinaryIdiot,,,"Hmm it seems HN lost my reply. Odd. Anyway...<p>> The gold standard also ensures accessibility (the responsibility for accessibility is transferred from browser maker to developer). I suspect many developers, even Google in some of their examples, will forget to add it or think it doesn&#x27;t apply to them/their app, I find this a huge concern (the web until now embraced accessibility as a universal value).<p>So there are a few things to keep in mind about the gold standard. First, it&#x27;s not entirely accessibility related and I would argue it&#x27;s mostly a best-practices check-list. When you look through the gold standard I would say a large majority of the items are things you need to take care of regardless if you&#x27;re creating a web component, a simple composite of HTML tags, an angular directive, ember component, jQuery plug-in or even an opensocial widget. For instances you always need to be mindful of your dependencies, load order and local side affects when giving anything to the general public that you hope to be used.<p>Yes there are a handful of things that you need to do to make web components behave a little nicer in web browsers as far as accessibility goes but the majority of those items need to be applied regardless of how you break up your code so this argument isn&#x27;t very interesting or useful, in my opinion.<p>Second, depending on your use case you may not even care about many of those items. Sure in an ideal world we would all care about every item no matter what but the truth is if you&#x27;re developing components to simply organize your code in a small web app or just for your organization you may not care at all about side affects or dependencies and I think that&#x27;s fair; not everything needs to stand up to the rigor of something being related for the general populous to use.<p>I will agree that Google does not always follow their own guidelines with this type of thing, however.<p>> Web Components are not ‘just’ composites of plain old HTML, some styling and JavaScript, they require tooling and polyfilling (and some polyfilling will make apps slow for users that don&#x27;t have the latest tech). This is potentially bad for new people in the industry (have to learn many tools before they can get started), and bad for users (as their device might be toos low).<p>Actually web components are just composites of plain old HTML, styling and JavaScript. They do not require any specific tooling (in fact the only tooling I&#x27;ve seen or used for web components is Polymer&#x27;s vulcanize and it&#x27;s absolutely terrible; I&#x27;ve never seen it work correctly on the first shot) and they only require polyfills if you want to use them in non-evergreen browsers (Firefox and Chrome mostly support what you need today). Regardless of the technicalities I do agree that web components can be slow and it&#x27;s one of my gripes about them though I really don&#x27;t know what tools you&#x27;re talking about being required to start.",1436166880

Both of these things can be done without bitcoin -- and far simpler too.<p>Although the idea I sketched out is for a decentralized reddit, a centralized reddit that just integrated payments is also totally valid idea.

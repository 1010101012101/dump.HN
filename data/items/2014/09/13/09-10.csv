You’re right that without careful attention/training it’s hard to state colors in terms of coordinates in terms of cone cell responses directly or color opponent signals (blue–yellow, red–green, white–black). It’s easy to train someone to give reasonably accurate color coordinates in terms of lightness, hue, and chroma, however.<p>If you want to understand human color vision in detail, I recommend this online resource: <a href=""http://www.handprint.com/LS/CVS/color.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.handprint.com/LS/CVS/color.html</a>",1410602333

To extend his example, if the restaurant business were like search engines, you&#x27;d have a choice of just a few big chains (maybe macdonalds, and pizza hut) which would be on every street.<p>Direct competition is absolutely vital, because it drives innovation.  Innovation is how companies escape competition.<p>Companies should perhaps enjoy some limited &quot;monopoly&quot; over their innovations, but they should not be allowed to milk them forever, and probably, for example, the current patent system awards much too much and too long a monopoly for much too little innovation.<p>Introducing, encouraging, or even mandating competition by splitting companies up, is required in order to keep companies innovating, rather than dominating and then exploiting, and it is one of government&#x27;s most important functions, sadly neglected in recent decades.<p>Of course VC fund managers like Thiel would like you to believe that monopolies are good, since that&#x27;s how they profit - invest upfront, and then reap huge rewards based on monopoly valuations.",1410600430

I refer 2 or 3 people every week for sleep evaluations, afterwards almost all say, &quot;hey that wasn&#x27;t a bad experience at all.&quot;<p>Poor sleep can be lead to bigger health problems--it&#x27;s a long list I won&#x27;t go into it now, but a good part of the time helping sleep helps alleviate other conditions.<p>Basic healthy sleep rules: give an hour to wind down and to wake up.  Avoid the &quot;blue light&quot; body snatching phones, computers and all the rest of those evil things ;)  Especially in that PM winding-down time.<p>In any case, if you have frequent or continuous sleep disturbance, don&#x27;t suffer silently, talk to your primary care doc, just describe the trouble, don&#x27;t try to explain it, that&#x27;s the doc&#x27;s job.  Don&#x27;t underplay the problem, it may be serious.  It&#x27;s just taking good care of yourself, and since it is <i>your top priority job</i>, don&#x27;t wait do it.",1410599814

Am I mistaken about that?<p>It kinda depends on what you think as a color. Computer monitors rely heavily on that (normal) human vision can not distinguish from eg. red-green and &quot;true&quot;[1] yellow, even though they are completely different from physical perspective. So a typical computer monitor does not bother to create &quot;true&quot; yellow and instead cheats by outputting red-green when asked for yellow.<p>If we had an <i>hypothetical</i> tetrachromat with additional cones sensitive for yellow light, her color vision would span the same <i>range</i> as normal (trichromat) color vision, ie cover the same piece of EM spectrum. But normal computer monitors would not be able to reproduce for her what she sees in real world.<p>Then there is the somewhat related discussion about violet and red-blue which is quite curious when you begin think about it.<p>[1] I&#x27;m using &quot;true&quot; color to refer light with specific wavelength",1410599352

8311921,comment,8310137,8311101,1,0,bshimmin,,,"We&#x27;ve had exactly this experience over the last year, trying to use Rails Admin as a cheap way to build a content management system for a moderately large site with diverse types of content where we didn&#x27;t really have budget to invest in building our own CMS.<p>Rails Admin definitely excels at getting you running very quickly by providing a simple interface for CRUD actions around basic models.  Where it falls down - aside from dealing well with relationships, as you mention, which is arguably hard to get right - is when you want to extend that basic functionality and provide a better or different experience for your users.  We&#x27;ve had to create custom views for letting users control the layout of certain content types, including various drag-and-drop operations, and that was pretty unpleasant to achieve (one of those horrible times where you just end up hopefully copying from other people&#x27;s projects because figuring out how to do it yourself from the documentation is just impossible); and we&#x27;ve ended up writing a lot of CoffeeScript to hack Rails Admin views to do what we wanted in various circumstances - much of this ended up very fiddly due to working with a quite weighty Bootstrap DOM.<p>Lastly, the custom DSL, while clever, suffers from the usual pitfalls that plague these types of DSLs - your code can become quite bloated and re-use is very difficult to achieve.  We have half a dozen models that broadly have the same customisations in Rails Admin, but we mostly ended up copying swathes of code from one to another because there wasn&#x27;t a good way to re-use any of it.<p>The documentation is also a bit hit and miss, and issues on the GitHub issue tracker are pretty much left to fester, sadly.<p>In summary, I&#x27;d use Rails Admin again if I wanted an interface to allow experienced users to get a quick appraisal of, or make small modifications to, the data in a project; if I were doing something involving regular users again, I can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;d consider Rails Admin a good option.",1410598990

This sort of things.<p>Not all of these are problematic for all people, but to the extent some are problematic for a given person, they tend to form a vicious cycle - people do bad things to themselves from lack of awareness or temporarily depleted willpower, and those behaviors in turn cause even less self-awareness and reduce the willpower reserves further.<p>For that reason I am contemplating some sort of a software-based aid that helps one person to periodically check on the other person's daily routine from a distance to make sure they haven't fallen into this sort of a ""depression trap"". I tentatively call it ""a brother's keeper"" project, although realistically it's more likely to be the subject's parents or childhood friends who will bother to check daily on how many minutes he or she spent outside and how many meals did they have per day, and whether there were enough nutrients in it. The point would be not to nag the subject daily, but to catch the moment they are falling off the bus, so to speak, and either intervene, summon other friends, or get professional help.",1330203084

Now if a user has 3rd party cookies disabled, Google does not know the user, and thus cannot apply her preferences.<p>An alternative solution on the browser side (and I think I saw this before somewhere) would be to only send cookies to a 3rd part site if the user has visited that site 1st party style before; i.e. don't accept 3rd party cookies if they are new. That's a pretty weak signal in the case of Google (who doesn't visit that page?), but at least for many other websites it could improve the status quo ante. If I've never visited some ad network's site, they should probably not be able to track me. Ads could then display inline a ""Customize Ads"" link that allows users to opt in to targeted advertisement.<p>""User has visited 3rd party host somewhen"" is probably too bad a signal.

I wish I had a whole bunch of money and just paid people to make them all. But it doesn't work that way.<p>I think it's my negativity and critisism. When I see something that's already been made, I look for its flaw. I almost always find something wrong or imperfect with it. So then I ask myself why it feels wrong, how it can be made better or different, and from that another idea and invention is born. Sometimes so different from its origin that it becomes a whole new different product or service. I mix and match different little fixes together and eventually they create a whole new product.<p>Other times, idea formation is just subconscious. It happens without thinking. It cooks in the back of your mind and when it's done it gets pushed towards your consciousness and you realize you have a ""good idea"". Where it came from, you don't know.",1330202728

Someone who has five years of experience could actually have more experience than someone who has ten, since the one who has been working for ten years may have been doing exactly the same thing for all ten years while the other person could have picked up many new skills over five years. One book I've read talked about ""having the same one year of experience ten times"", as compared with a true ten years of experience.<p>Similarly, someone with 25 years of experience could really have an advantage over someone with 10 years of experience if their career included working in many different areas. And not all experience is purely technical -- someone who has worked with many different kinds of people and projects for 25 years and has released and supported lots of products might have insights and instincts that a less experienced person might not have.",1330202701

Does Salesforce has all the features needed? Does Kindle export notes?<p>- Development libraries: There are easy to use libraries to do X in the technology Y?<p>- Changing industries: Does industry X have a problem that was already solved in industry Y?<p>- Futurism: What we will need in one year? and in ten years? For example, do I need a voice based web browsing to use while I am doing other things? (like Siri does with e-mail). How I can integrate the information from a lot of sources (G+, Twitter, Facebook, CRMs, etc).

If it does, I think about whether or not it would be a feature of a project we're already working on, or would become a whole new product.  In either case, it has to be prioritized relative to the existing work.  In some cases, it's easy enough to say ""this isn't important enough to work on right now, so it goes in the backlog.""  In other case, it's not so clear, so you might want to get out and talk to people. I like to bounce ideas off a select handful of people I know and trust initially, and then - depending on the feedback - I might start talking it up to a wider audience, and/or blog/tweet/g+/etc. the idea to solicit discussion.<p><i>Do cool things just randomly pop in your head after whatever things you do through life?</i><p>Sometimes, but I find that most of the cool ideas I have (well, the ones that I think are cool anyway) occur in response to reading or studying something new, or something that shifts my perspective.  I'm a rabid reader anyway, and I try to stretch my boundaries by reading books that span a lot of territory.  Even in terms of technical books... I mean, I'm a software guy by trade, but one of the last books I read was <i>Beyond Boundaries</i>[2] by Miguel Nicolelis, which deals with neuroscience and brain/machine interfaces.  And lying around here somewhere are some books on nanotechnology, philosophy of mind, artificial life, economics, etc., etc.  I often find inspiration from reading something seemingly fairly unrelated to my day to day work.<p>I also find that talking to interesting people, doing  interesting stuff, with other cool ideas, can spark a new idea.  As such, I hang out at the local hackerspace[3] quite often, and just listen in, talk to people, swap ideas, etc.  Going to user group meetings around new technologies and talking to people there can also spark ideas.<p>Another neat thing to do, is to follow the ""incubator""[4] discussion list at the Apache Software Foundation.  Just following what new and interesting projects are being submitted there can potentially spark some cool and creative ideas.<p><i>As a follow-up, how do you actually validate whether or not you will actually move forward with it (market opportunity, personal problem, growth potential, ease/challenge of problem, customer validation)?</i><p>See above, but if something makes it as far as being seriously considered for a product / product feature, I'm a big fan of @sgblank's ""Customer Development"" approach.

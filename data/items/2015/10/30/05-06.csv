Jonathan Way, who works in Massachusetts for the National Park Service, claims in a forthcoming paper that it has. He thinks its morphological and genetic divergence from its ancestors is sufficient to qualify. But many disagree. One common definition of a species is a population that will not interbreed with outsiders. Since coywolves continue to mate with dogs and wolves, the argument goes, they are therefore not a species. But, given the way coywolves came into existence, that definition would mean wolves and coyotes should not be considered different species either—and that does not even begin to address whether domestic dogs are a species, or just an aberrant form of wolf.<p>In reality, “species” is a concept invented by human beings. And, as this argument shows, that concept is not clear-cut. What the example of the coywolf does demonstrate, though, is that evolution is not the simple process of one species branching into many that the textbooks might have you believe.</i>",1446184051

10476294,comment,10475666,10475973,0,0,dragonwriter,,,">  This crushingly intense focus on STEM is shortsighted. The root of the problem is a lack of clarity of writing, both in english and in code.<p>I think lack of clarity in writing -- either in code or in natural language -- isn&#x27;t the <i>root</i> of the problem, its a symptom of a lack of good, clear <i>general</i> analytical process. Lots of programmers I&#x27;ve met are great at analyzing how to implement a very explicitly described thing in code, but aren&#x27;t great at analyzing domain information to determine how to solve a problem.<p>I don&#x27;t think that STEM-focused education is <i>bad</i> for this, but I think that developing generalized analytic skills seems to be helped by having experience applying analysis in varied and not-closely-related contexts, particularly contexts where the problems are often fuzzily defined and you need to do work to discover, or impose, structured order to compose a response.<p>Collegiate English departments <i>can</i> be an important venue for that, but I don&#x27;t think uniquely so -- so can Philosophy or social sciences departments. (But its all highly dependent on the particular institution, professor, and courses chosen.) I&#x27;m personally partial to legal writing, specifically (often addressed in undergraduate coursework in law-focussed political science courses) as a vehicle for developing this skill, but then I&#x27;m a programmer who&#x27;s also a law geek, and who was a political science major, so, there&#x27;s probably some bias there.",1446183150

However I&#x27;m talking about the kind of analysis that really requires humans who understand the larger ecosystem. A bot can&#x27;t understand that some interface design is broken on windows because some kernel API exists that subverts its assumptions.<p>Further, the cost of backing out or applying a patch isn&#x27;t zero. A bad patch landing (even one that passed all the analysis at your disposal!) can cause big projects to have to basically shut down their tree as they scramble to figure out what&#x27;s wrong. This is a huge cost.\nThe classic example of this is creating a sporadic test failure, causing random patches to bounce.<p>I&#x27;ve definitely worked in projects where I&#x27;ll basically automerge some PRs because I know the person is great and the risks are low, but this is generally conditional on the purpose of the PR.

If it&#x27;s adding some functionality, I need to review if that functionality should be added.<p>However a big value of PRs is to force us to uncut corners. We all cut corners (or miss obvious details) when we program, and I see human review constantly catching this kind of sloppiness and forcing great programmers (the kind I&#x27;d automerge on trivial changes) to do the job right. If you just automerge, you accumulate code debt much more rapidly.

One person, obviously very knowledgeable about art and art history is waxing poetic about the use of colour, the balance of round shapes with square shapes and the almost beastial quality of the theme.  You look at the picture and instantly recognize it as &quot;Dogs Playing Poker&quot;.  Of the 20-30 people looking at the picture, you realize that you are the only one who can actually see the dogs and notice that they are playing poker.  Everybody else is entranced with vague, undefined shapes and mysterious gradients of colour.<p>You say, &quot;It&#x27;s &#x27;Dogs Playing Poker&#x27;&quot; and the esteemed expert beams in your direction saying, &quot;You are absolutely right!  Do you see the green here, it&#x27;s almost like the felt on a gambling table.  These shapes here seem to be alive with animal ferocity.  I like your description of playing poker, as it fits well with the whimsical nature of the composition.&quot;  The others in the group nod approvingly.<p>Someone who has a really good palette and who has trained it well can easily tell who can taste the wine and who can&#x27;t -- just in the same way that most people can tell who is visually impaired and who isn&#x27;t.  And because the ability to taste the wine to that level is really, really rare, the experts who have a disability are often completely unaware of it -- they are miles better than your average person who has not studied the subject every minute of their adult life.  So the wool is already over their eyes, so to speak.<p>The thing I&#x27;m incredulous about is the lack of due diligence from the auction houses.  Someone claims to be selling hundreds of thousands of dollars of incredibly rare wine dating from WWII and before.  When someone asks where a wine was originally bought, the seller says he will have to look it up.  There is <i>no</i> provenance at all!!!  &quot;Oh I just happened to have this bottle of 1923 Bordeaux in my basement&quot;.  Pull the other one...  So from that perspective, it truly is amazing how gullible people are.",1446182631

Hundreds of millions of people rely on Realm, through apps from Pinterest, Google, Amazon, eBay, Intel, Hipmunk, Expensify, GoPro, the BBC, Adidas, IBM, Homeland Security, Walmart and many, many more. We’re also the #4 most-starred database on GitHub with >7,000 stars and growing fast.<p>I oversee our Product & Marketing efforts and find myself looking for a new Product Manager to join our team. You must be someone with a background in native mobile development (ideally both Objective-C/Swift AND Java). You must have a deep understanding of the technical & business concerns of mobile app developers, and an attention for detail in SDK API design, visual UX, and technical writing.<p>Experience with native development is required, but any additional experience you have with other mobile frameworks (React Native, PhoneGap, Xamarin, Unity, …) will be a big plus.<p>You don’t have to have formal experience as a product manager.

It&#x27;s not a random representative sampling of all accused criminals who make it through a full trial - the prosecution is like a football team that has the power to call off the match <i>at any point up until the last minute</i> if it looks like they might lose. We shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that they tend to win when they choose not to do so.<p>3. This is well-studied and very intuitive: the more serious (and newsworthy) the charges, the more personal and political pressure to pursue a case, even a marginal one. You don&#x27;t consider this possibility when speculating why federal courts have lower conviction rates.<p>4.

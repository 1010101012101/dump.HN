471956,comment,471660,471660,0,0,gruseom,,,"It's interesting that an essay about how to avoid religious arguments should center around a timeless spiritual principle. (I wouldn't say it's ironic, though; what's ironic is how people turn religions into their opposites and still call them the same thing.) This principle (of non-identification) is also very practical. It's amazing to me how often suffering comes from saying ""I am X"", therefore ""I am negated if X is negated"". The converse is also true: it's amazing how much more freely one can live when one doesn't do that.",1234076221

IMO, it's one of the stupidest things I have ever done because we lost the trust with the employees and ended up losing productivity.

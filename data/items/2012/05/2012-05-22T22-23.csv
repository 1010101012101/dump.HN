There is a big difference between using cash flows to add 24/7 support and raising VC money.

I mean, health communities like patientslike.com offer great opportunities for programmers, database designers and owners of the company (user submitted data can be sold), but health as a concept isn't very strictly defined -- how could it be?<p>It is quite easy to take some condition (one database table: ""condition""), associate some drugs to it (another db-table) and let users tell that they have certain condition and that they have tried this and that drug for the it (few more db-tables). Ofcourse it would be nice, if users could somehow tell that they have some (preprogrammed) symptoms like ""brain fog"" (another db-table). Add something more that users can select and soon there will be enough information for automatically generated stats.<p>For example: http://www.patientslikeme.com/symptoms/show/189
(I'm not implying anything the referred site. I'm just using it as an example.)<p>Researchers and drug manufactures might find the stats useful in some way (by seeing some kind of patterns that other maybe can't) and the others could atleast satisfy their curiosity related to questions like ""what are the top 5 in.."".<p>However, from the user's point of view (potential or actual condition/symptom carrier) certain issue might arise: he thinks that he has found ""soulmates"" (in larger health communities ""with blogs and everything""), but even when their symptoms match, they might have nothing in common at the neural level, for example. Actually, both of their conditions could be caused by different enviromental issues, but user couldn't let the System know, what kind of environmental issues might be involved -- and that's why the user keeps trying different kind of medications that other ""soulmates"" have tried (might take 10 years to go through all of them).<p>Think about Asperger's (aspies, like they might say). They seem to have something in common, but that might because the definition of the symptoms and their naming is too vague. Same goes for the criteria of many conditions. That would understandable in some sense as we as humans prefer to use common words like ""socially handicapped"" (instead of something more cryptic).<p>At this point you should be able to see what I might mean.

It was a way for the interviewer to evaluate my ability to not know how to answer a question.  It took me almost an hour to solve, but it gave the interviewer a pretty clear insight into my ability to approach something new.<p>In my experience the best interview questions I've had have been situations where I was asked a question about something I was not familiar with.  The interviewer then gave me a 5 minute overview of the things I need to know (like which synchronization methods are available in pthreads, for instance) and then give me the chance to apply the things I just learned.

Perhaps it would have flown out of the storm, perhaps it would have descended. Either way at some point it would have gotten low enough or warm/dry enough that the ice in the pitot tube would have melted (also the heater in the tube was on, but didn't have enough time to melt it), and the system would go back to normal and all would have been well.<p>Instead they did pretty much the only thing that could doom it: They ascended. This despite knowing they were near the ""coffin corner"" - i.e. the highest safe altitude for the Jet. The pilot clearly panicked and didn't want to crash into the ocean, so he went up, and it was exactly the wrong thing to do.<p>Your point about pilot inexperience in manual flying, is close. But from what I read it was actually that the pilot was used to the computer taking over and not letting him fly in a dangerous manner, this caused him to try ascend to the point of stalling the plane because he believed the computer would stop him.<p>So you end up with the worst of both worlds: A human who relies on the computer, taking over in a situation with no computer. You have to pick: Either computer all the time, or no computer. Perhaps computer assistance, but no control? Certainly computer override is no good (i.e. this lets you max out the controls and the computer will adjust them to the ideal levels).<p>> you need situationally aware human pilots.<p>This was impossible for both of them. The windscreen was completely blank, and (some of) the instruments were disabled. Neither the pilot nor the human had any idea what their situation was. What they should have done was remember where they were and assume they were more of less in the same situation.",1337726475

I think we need to be developing human spaceflight in parallel with robotic exploration, for the same reason that we don't do all our exploration on earth with telescopes. Air travel is orders of magnitude more difficult than sea travel, which is orders of magnitude more difficult than wandering about on land. I think there is no substitute for getting out there and attempting a wide variety of technological workarounds, notwithstanding the fact that many of these will be futile or fatal. The key plus for me of private or even semi-private space exploration is that failure or fatality won't mean a loss of political capital, compared to publicly-owned and managed space endeavors. Bluntly, we're more likely to discover better technologies if people are allowed to blow themselves up in the pursuit of same. On the last point, planetary colonization is one (remote) endpoint, if we can bootstrap it, but I think asteroid mining and the like also offers the potential of non-planetary habitation, which I find far more interesting.

Job interviews don't have to be as difficult as credentials are both required (there are folks at Google and Facebook without CS degrees -- and that's a good thing, obviously) and are difficult to get irrespective of where you go to school (CS programs wary widely, as this is still a young discipline unlike biology).<p>Pharmacy is also similar, with a few caveats: pay is somewhat below what a software engineer can expect mid-career (~$120,000 for retail pharmacy, somewhat less for pharma research), residency is not required, but rotations are still insane, and schools are still selective.<p>In some ways, I think it would benefit the patients if the medical profession was somewhat more meritocratic and less focused on pushing students to their breaking point during rotations and residency, which continues because ""that's the way it has always been done"". It still somewhat scares me just _what_ a sleep-deprived student could do to a patient due to the very basics of sleep deprivation.<p>[Full disclosure: I work at Facebook and have dated a pharm student/pharmacist.]<p>Of course ""in the medical profession"" doesn't equal ""doctor or pharmacist"". Likewise, ""software engineer"" doesn't equal ""software engineer at Google or Facebook"": there are plenty of firms that don't use coding interviews. Nobody says that to be a software engineer, you have to work at a licensed firm that has to (as part of licensing) use a certain hiring process, require certain credentials, etc...<p>(This also isn't an endorsement of all modern interview practices: it's particularly silly for startups to cargo-cult interview questions they've overheard at other companies without measuring their effectiveness and calibrating candidates' response.)",1337726377

In the past few months I've undertaken a few pretty ""rigorous"" application processes. A couple of Bay Area startups (I don't live in the Bay Area), and a bunch of other companies both locally and for remote working possibilities.<p>Startups seem to be the worst when it comes to turning the hiring process into a huge time sink for the candidate. At its worst was one of the Bay Area startups. They outline a 7- or 8-phase interview process. There are independent programming exercises, pair programming over Skype, phone interviews, then at the end they have the candidate in for ""cultural fit evaluation"" which turned into a six-hour interview gauntlet after flying across the country that morning.<p>Another bit of inconsideration of my time and my actual job where I work to make money was a company that wanted me to come in in the middle of the afternoon on a workday for 2 hours to ""meet the team"". I told them I did not feel comfortable leaving the office at 1:30 and go AWOL/take a half day of vacation so I could interview at another place. I wound up backing out of the interview process because of their unwillingness to pick another meeting time, even over lunch.<p>Then finally tomorrow I am meeting with a company, and they told me yesterday afternoon that they'd like me to prepare a presentation on something I'm passionate about (they liked Jeff Atwood's blog post[1] I guess). This actually I don't mind at all, and think it's a great idea... but I need more than a couple of days' notice.

Today, a group of people acts in social cooperation primarily through a political system. They may have an important social goal, like improving child nutrition, but the political system has already leeched the social power necessary for its achievement. Thus, any other social goals being worked out through the political system, such as economic growth, national security, even personal liberty, are at odds with the social goal you're concerned with, simply by nature of having to work through a defined, singular system. You can only push and pull a lever in so many directions, no matter how complicated and multi-axial it is.

They inform the system, but are not properties of it.<p>The intent of communism (esp. with the abolition of the state) is not, contrary to many views, some evil dictatorial master plan, but simply to put social power back into the hands of the people, allowing the existence and implementation of real social priorities, such as child nutrition.",1337725988

Rather, I'm arguing it must inform <i>how</i> we explore. Space travel is so lethal for our species that we are better off engineering machines, robots or beings that are specialized to operate in space.<p>2. The energy expenditure, economic cost and sheer distance of space exploration is many orders of magnitude beyond the costs of land, sea or air travel. Comparing terrestrial forms of travel to space exploration is disingenuous.<p>3. No endpoint. When the great explorers were trailblazing across the oceans there was a reasonable expectation of finding a suitable endpoint with fresh water, edible plants & animals, other people (!) and exploitable resources. With space exploration none of these things are present. We have to carry a suitable endpoint with us during the journey and plant it where ever we happen to land.<p>Expanding on that last point - imagine a specialized mars robotic explorer that goes on a one-way mission, taps in a sub-surface source of water, erects a basic greenhouse structure, goes into sleep mode for a few months, wakes up, plants some seeds, sleeps a while longer, etc. - it bootstraps a suitable endpoint for human explorers to inhabit years, decades or centuries later.",1337724804

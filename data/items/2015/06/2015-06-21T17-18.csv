    > At that time I believe the average subscriber life was about 25 months and revenue was about $350 so we spent about $35 to acquire subscribers. As we were able to lower the cost of disks/trial/etc we were able to ramp up marketing. (Plus, we knew Microsoft was coming and it was never going to be easier or cheaper to get market share.) When we went public in 1992 we had less than 200,000 subscribers; a decade later the number was in the 25 million range. That helped drive our market capitalization up from $70 million at the time of the IPO to $150 billion when we decided to combine with Time Warner to accelerate our transition to broadband and diversify our revenue mix.

Currently, an app like Omnioutliner or Clear that improves a person&#x27;s productivity over years and is used 100-1000x as much as a 99c joke app can only command a 10x higher price and is then impeded by people being reluctant to pay so much up front.<p>But... to address your main point - yes absolutely, I&#x27;d happily give up a quarter of revenue to move to such a scheme, where my recurring revenue would be much higher because my apps are actually used by people and have a lower barrier for new users.  It would be a mutually beneficial chance for developers, apple, and consumers.<p>However - I do grant that developers are more likely to be able to finance this transition than musicians.<p>Since nobody is paying for the music during the trial, and the intended result is higher revenues for the artists (and for Apple, but notably proportionally <i>more</i> for the artists), it is flatly disingenuous for the artists to position Apple as getting all the benefit.<p>What if Apple offered the artists an advance covering the 3 months based on current iTunes revenues, and then recouped this over three years by taking a higher percentage for that period from the artists who opted for it?

More importantly, most stationary cameras can&#x27;t be commanded by police to send a live feed. Building a network of cameras covering the entire city would have large infrastructure costs and significant surveillance concerns. As far as I know, only a few places in the UK have done this. The infrastructure cost of drones is much lower, and privacy concerns are practically nonexistent. The drones would only record for a few minutes around the area of a shooting.<p>Yes, some places might have poor sight-lines. That&#x27;s a great example of where drones beat static cameras. Places with poor sight-lines would require many static cameras, and they&#x27;d need to be updated to reflect new construction. Drones can fly around obstructions, making them more effective than cameras in these situations.<p>Human controllers would be useful, but cost wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. You don&#x27;t need a deputized police officer on &quot;drone duty&quot; at every station. More likely, controllers would be contractors servicing a large area.

I don&#x27;t know much about Ruby and Python, but the JVM also allows you to define subsets of IO (even restricted by actual files) that are enforced by the runtime, or subsets of IO operations that will be enforced by the compiler. This technique has been used in imperative languages for a very long time.

You don&#x27;t want your test to actually take five seconds.  You want to rapidly test the code in the case that a timeout occurs before completion of the action and vice versa.  You want those tests to be 100% deterministic and fast.  With the World approach described you can get that.<p>Also, there is nothing about the technique described that limits you to unit tests.  IMVU tests entire web services with this approach and it works well.  &quot;World&quot; in that case includes APIs for accessing Redis, MySQL, the customer&#x27;s session, time, concurrency, and so on.

9754102,comment,9751758,9753300,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"OK, so you&#x27;re on about a physical/temporal separation of IO and logic: the logical calculations can be performed separately to the IO actions, and vice versa.<p>I view that as pretty trivial though; it&#x27;s just a case of switching out the language&#x27;s IO primitives, which are effectively free variables. With most &quot;large&quot; languages (Java, Haskell, etc.), the implementations are usually gnarly enough to make such substitution a significant engineering accomplishment, but that&#x27;s an artefact of the situation, not the approach. As an analogy, the task of fitting corrective optics to the Hubble space telescope was only difficult because it was the Hubble space telescope; fitting adaptive optics is trivial enough that bespectacled children do it every day.<p>In light of this, I think that disentangling mixed-up <i>definitions</i> is a much more important and interesting problem. It&#x27;s non-trivial to extract pure computations from imperative code (whether they&#x27;re written in Java, or Haskell, or whatever), yet there is a great potential benefit for improving code, in terms of understandability, modularity, re-use, maintainence, etc. The fact that pure code is easier to test, or that side-effects can be substituted for the purposes of tests, is really a minor point in comparison. They are workarounds for running code which has too many responsibilities. Much better to avoid the problem in the first place by writing separate code for separate concerns.",1434906566

And instead of landing at 1000 unknown landing points have them shuttle packages between a few known landing points. I.E go down to the corner Walgreens drone landing zone (rooftops or parking lots employees get the package from the drone drop it in a drop box for you to pick up and swap batteries for the next flight) Then you just head down to pick up whatever was just flown 10 miles to your area for you instead of fighting rush hour traffic, thus removing a car from said traffic and making the world a better place. The last mile becomes the last 100 yards.<p>The point is there are solvable problems that can make drones viable. I&#x27;ve done a great many long distance autonomous drone flights (we&#x27;re talking miles) to then have it land within 3ft of where it was supposed to. The tech is very close to being up to the task (3-5 years) the regulation however is not.<p>Food for thought Cars kill 40k people per year in the US, even if a few are killed by drones the number of deaths avoided by having less car trips would likely well more then offset those killed by falling drones.<p>One more thing, if cars were invented today they would most likely be made illegal due to the potential for death (40k/year). Aside from a handful of freak accidents drones don&#x27;t kill people yet there are a great many people trying to ban them out the the fear that they <i>might</i>.

Today&#x27;s music pretty much sucks, I mean the artists mostly didn&#x27;t even make their own music, they just buy the text and everything.
Most music of today costs way less than it costed years before and still isn&#x27;t that great, it&#x27;s just for the masses and yet artists are crying cause they get not enough?
Huh 10 $ per month is a lot especially when you think about it, a normal person won&#x27;t buy an album every month which costs nearly 10 $ per month..
Also why should an artist live with a single hit for his whole life? That makes no sense.<p>People in this business don&#x27;t live in the reality, I mean more and more films happen to be on streaming platforms, yet a film costs way more to produce than music and still you pay the same price for netflix / amazon instant video / etc than for a music streaming service.<p>Also why does an album online costs as much as an album inside the store??

Apps can be anywhere from $1 to $500, while songs typically hover around $0.99. The wide variance in app pricing makes a subscription model challenging to satisfy all users and developers.<p>- Different markets. When you make an app, you&#x27;re tying it to be used on a specific platform. It is additional work to make it cross-platform. That alone is limiting for an apps&#x27; market, and in the case of iOS, the platform&#x27;s owner can impose additional limits. Music is open-ish in the sense that you can make music once and release it in a way that it&#x27;s playable, essentially, everywhere.<p>- Different revenue streams. Music is a digital good like apps, but it&#x27;s also a physical good (CDs, records) and most importantly it&#x27;s a service (live performances). It&#x27;s possible to have additional revenue streams with apps, but it&#x27;s not as common as it is with music.

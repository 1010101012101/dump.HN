2957266,comment,2956830,2956830,4,0,TomOfTTB,,,"The problem I have with this story and with the health care debate in general is I think political agenda is blocking people from rationally looking at the problem.<p>In the United States it is already illegal for a hospital to deny someone medical care.  Whether they can pay or not they have to be given care.  The problem here is the same isn't true of medication and dental work.<p>An insanely stupid flaw but an insanely easy one to fix.<p>By fixing that one flaw everyone in this article would have lived.  The problem is the American public is fixated on Universal Health Care.  Democrats want it, Republicans want to block it and no one is looking at other solutions to the problem.<p>That's really a problem because the debates take time.  It is very likely ObamaCare is going to be defunded (the odds of the Republicans taking the Senate in 2012 are very good statistically).  Once that happens we're going to be right back where we started AGAIN.<p>But there are plenty of solutions that would (or at least should) appease both sides that could be implemented almost instantly.<p>My personal opinion has always been that Health Care should be dealt with through low to no interest borrowing.  The government was willing to subsidize 30 year loans to people with no credit if it meant buying a house so why shouldn't the same be true for medical care.  That way this 24 year old can get anything he needs for under $10 a month (and we can offer deferred payment to those in bad circumstances like unemployment).<p>That solution could literally be implemented tomorrow.  Just tell banks ""the government will back these loans in the same way we used to back Student Loans when they were done through private banks"".  Then BOOM!  Problem solved in the interim and and we can continue to debate Universal Health Care for years safely knowing no one will die while the debate was going on.",1315057936

2957204,comment,2954755,2954994,1,0,rpedroso,,,"Simpler solution (which GTD practitioners already know): keep a Waiting On list. Put due dates on it. Follow up when you hit the due date.<p>I use Todoist, but this will work with many todo systems, including pen & paper ones. When populating a project with items, like ""Email Greg with questions from the RFP"", I also add an item, like ""Get RFP questions from Greg"" and tag it with @waiting. I will also give the latter item a due date (e.g. 24 hours). If I want to see everything I'm waiting on, I can just look at the @waiting tag, but it's going to pop up when it's due anyways.<p>This is a much better solution if you already have todo lists, since you don't have to train yourself to perform a different activity, or keep track of yet another list of things in another program. Plus, it separates todo list maintenance activities from your email inbox. That kind of mental separation makes me way more productive by reducing the complexity of the given activity (i.e. sending an email).",1315055259

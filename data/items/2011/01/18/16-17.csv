I would conclude that Zynga would be worth quite a lot, but that would make Facebook's position quite a bit weaker, do you agree?<p>Also, the feedback loop is that Facebook's valuation and success spurs people and investors to start companies and then advertise them on FB.

So ads can fulfill the user's purpose on Google by providing information but they're just getting in the way of the user's purpose on Facebook.<p>2.  Facebook's growth hides the fact that the ads don't work.

Let me shed some light on the process from what I've learned over the past year.<p>- Artists are all about distribution.  For artists to want to effectively ""sign"" with you, you have to present them an avenue for distribution that is better than the current channels- Youtube, MySpace, Facebook, direct sales (Record labels and ITunes), and current music startups like us.<p>- For fans to want to be interested, there has to be a value proposition for them.  Sure they want to be connected with artists, but there has to be something in it for them.  We thought that by having millions of free streaming music would do it, but even then its STILL hard to get fans to commit.<p>So I don't know what you have in mind, but you have to keep your mind on distribution.  And just a word of caution--if it involves anything revolving around distributing music, be prepared for lawsuits. :)",1258411918

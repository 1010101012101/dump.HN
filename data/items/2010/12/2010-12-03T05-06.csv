Every time a programmer has to change jobs, she has to face a barrage of pointless trivia questions from megalomaniacs. Of course, many of them then grumble that they can't find competent programmers.<p>Also, I think that the interviewer anti-loop that Steve Yegge mentions (<a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-goog...</a>) is real.<p><i>Well, back when I was at Amazon, we did (and they undoubtedly still do) a LOT of soul-searching about this exact problem.

1964930,comment,1964661,1964661,0,0,jeromec,,,"Mr. Adams says he's a fan of conspiracy theories, but I don't think so, since he suggests conspiracy theories are typically ""any wild story"" engineered to sound feasible. This definition goes against the whole reason for including the word ""theory"" which is supposed to suggest underlying assumptions are at least in part based on observations. He unwisely paints such theories as black or white in terms of how feasible they are, without acknowledging that the truth of many popular conspiracy theories may (often likely) fall somewhere between completely false or true.<p>Take his first example of a small group of rich people secretly running the world. Have people in the past conspired to influence outcomes at a local town or city wide level? Certainly. How about a larger scale than this, such as at a state or country level? Again, in many places, most certainly. Could that scale be increased even larger? Are there super wealthy people with power and influence? Certainly. When viewing things this way this ""unlikely"" theory becomes a lot more feasible, and the truth is probably somewhere between zero intentional conspiring, and one evil mastermind with an underground hundred-monitor supercomputer.<p>What about aliens abducting people? I don't know about implanting chips in people's necks, which Mr. Adams seems to have thrown in to conveniently push this theory into the complete nonsense pile. I've always heard simply about alien abductions. Now, most credible sane scientists will tell you that it's more likely than not there is alien life in the universe. If we've now established alien life likely exists, we can also reason that it's possible that some alien life is further evolved and advanced than humans. In my opinion, the first place the abduction theory breaks down is the likelihood of any actual contact with aliens in existence (the universe is a really, really big place). I would say that's unlikely enough to effectively kill the abduction theory completely. However, if one lets the mind wander and play then maybe sufficiently advanced life forms could have discovered a way to leap through spacetime akin to the Starship Enterprise's warp speed ability. Sure, that's still a huge stretch, but it does give a bit more entertaining feasibility to this abduction theory Mr. Adams has so completely dismissed.<p>To me <i>that's</i> how a true fan of conspiracy theories entertains them. ;)",1291355827

Syntax is slightly made-up because Java doesn't have true pass-by-value or pass-by-reference for object, only pass-reference-by-value.  But the test cases illustrate the expected semantics for each parameter passing mode.<p>In each case, you're passing a mutable object containing a value to the function.  In pass-by-value, you pass a completely new copy of the object in, so the mutation doesn't affect the original object at all, and then the reassignment obviously doesn't propagate back to the caller.  In pass-by-reference, you pass in a reference, so the mutation changes the object in the caller's scope, <i>and then the assignment reassigns the variable in the caller's scope to the new ValueHolder</i>.  It's this last part that pass-reference-by-value can't do: normal Java semantics let you mutate the object passed in, but you can't make the variable in the calling frame actually point to an entirely new object.<p>Make sense?",1291353389

1964838,comment,1964461,1964461,0,0,jerf,,,"Haskell is the academics coming out of the ivory tower to discover if their theories work in the real world, being joined by some more academically-inclined programmers trying to help them.<p>It's been a learning experience all around. Interesting things have happened and are happening. Not quite ready to call it ""practical"" but it sure is interesting.<p>IMHO, the most interesting confluence to date is a relatively practical Software Transactional Memory. There's a lot of good Haskell concurrency but it says something that for STM to really, really work, you pretty much seem to need Haskell. (It is a characteristic of STM that once you allow even a relatively small escape hatch, the guarantees it provides go flying out the window and it explodes in complexity beyond usefulness.) I'm still not sure exactly what this says, but I'm having fun learning. And note I'm not saying I even necessarily use STM all the time; I specifically find interesting the idea that it doesn't seem to work anywhere else because the temptation to impurity is too strong and it's the impurity that causes the complexity detonation; it's a good exemplar of the sort of interesting things going on, not the only such thing.<p>It may be the most genuinely innovative area of programming research going on right now. Most other communities seem to just be shuffling the same ideas around over and over again. (Or are so straight-up academic as to be impractically useless with no real chance of escaping that designation.) That does mean it is still full of rather sharp pointy bits, whereas even a brand new Algol-derived language now has so many decades of experience behind it that even its warts can start out well-polished. If Haskell does intrigue you, you should probably be aware that even though there are ten calendar years of Haskell history it still feels rather like a promising three-year-old language, with things like large library gaps, distressing amounts of ""best practices"" living in oral history and obscure mailing list posts, and some questions about ""how I do this"" not really having good answers.

By it's nature, it's not equivalent to GWT, and provides significant advantages over doing web development in most other frameworks or languages. The fact that it abstracts away JavaScript is only one of it's features, and as mentioned previously you can still use JavaScript. Furthermore, if you read the ""Lightweight, On-demand, and Beyond"" article I linked you to you would've seen how it's not middleware in the traditional sense and actually produces lightweight and on-demand output for target devices that is significantly more optimized and targeted than one could ever hope to do manually. Either way it's irrelevant as this just sidetracks from the real topic of discussion in that it's not necessary to learn or use JavaScript and that in most development cases it's advantageous and faster not to.<p>There was no reason for you to bundle NOLOH negatively in your response without actually taking a hard look at it.

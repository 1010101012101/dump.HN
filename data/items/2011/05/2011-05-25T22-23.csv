2585863,comment,2585668,2585765,20,0,grandalf,,,"The author misunderstands what Card is trying to say in response to her questions.   Also, she evidently misunderstood Ender's Game quite a bit as well.<p>Ender was suited to be a brilliant military commander precisely because he <i>hated</i> killing so much.  A more bloodthirsty commander would have fallen for certain traps, committed certain errors of judgment that Ender was immune to.  The nuance here is that Ender's strategic advantage came from a tremendous empathy with his adversary.<p>In the end, Ender had to be fooled into destroying the Buggers precisely because of this empathy.  He never would have been able to commit a genocide if he thought it was actually a genocide, but he could do it in the context of a video game.<p>And, for what it's worth, the childhood bullying delivered by Ender's brother was also a function of Ender's love for his brother.  We see very soon that Ender is capable of tremendous violence, but he tolerates mistreatment from Peter because he loves him so much.<p>It is this victimhood which endears Ender to any reader who has felt victimized, by showing that in some cases there is great physical and moral power beneath the surface.<p>The author of this strange hit piece is clearly trying to rile up various reactive political groups against Card.  Sure, card is a Mormon and appears somewhat socially conservative in his personal beliefs.  He is clearly not homophobic and became defensive when he sensed that the author was trying to broach the subject which had probably caused him much pain.<p>Sure some people believe that anyone who doesn't advocate same sex marriage qualifies as homophobic...   The author of the Salon piece clearly thinks that state recognition of same sex marriage is hugely important.<p>I'd argue that through his books Card has done far more good (by enlightening people about important moral issues) than any harm caused by his traditional view (restricting the word ""marriage"" but not the state sanctioned bond between two people).<p>The remarks about Card yapping and flirting suggest a very immature person wrote the article.  Clearly at a certain point Card was trying to be polite and let the interview finish without incident... something that was framed as ""shutting down""... Bizarre stuff.",1306363539

The problem with that line of thought is that you're never working only with your own code (that, and the fact that Scala is not optimized for your subset).<p>That's the bad thing with a language born out of lots of compromises -- while initially a pragmatic choice, if it's popular it only grows uglier and uglier until it becomes the bottleneck of the industry.<p>If you don't believe me that Scala is ugly, try explaining a ""Hello World"" to a beginner that was never exposed to programming, taking the sample out of the official documentation, preferably without resorting to a cargo-cult style explanation of ""just do this"".<p>Here, I'll get you started:<p><pre><code>   object HelloWorld {
     def main(args: Array[String]) {
       println(""Hello, world!"")
     }
   }
</code></pre>
You have to explain -- (1) what are functions + (2) what are those singleton objects, with OOP sprinkled in between + (3) why functions have to be declared inside classes or singleton objects + (4) what are generic types + (5) the ""main"" entry point.<p>Compare this to the Python version:<p><pre><code>    print ""Hello world""
</code></pre>
Or the Haskell version:<p><pre><code>    main = putStrLn ""Hello, World!""
</code></pre>
Both of which only require an explanation of functions + the main entry point in the Haskell case. Yeah, the Scala version does more - that's the problem with ugly, it cannot scale from simple to complex easily.",1306362606

Go figure.<p>But insofar as media conglomerates addressing this matter internally, why would they? It's not a problem for <i>them</i>.<p>Their revenues have been on a steady climb since ever. They know god damn well how little overlap exists in the groups ""definitely going to pay for it"" and ""would consider downloading it for free."" But they would have you believe that every ""illegal"" download represents a lost conversion.<p>Now there's blood in the water, because ""Hollywood"" is one of the few industries left in America which still makes any money, and as belts continue to tighten, highly compensated lobbyists (including the <i>most</i> highly compensated, Cary Sherman [1]) will be more and more successful in convincing conservative politicians that they need to vote to protect entrepreneurship and (not really) free market capitalism, and liberal politicians that they need to lend their support to secure the livelihoods of our poor struggling artists. The more sinister elements in all of our governing bodies will jump at any opportunity to introduce legislation which further erodes liberty but allows them to monitor/control that damn Internet thing. All the while, most artists still get fucked by the system, ClearChannel/LiveNation/GoldenVoice are still shitty, evil monopolies, and the executives of major media firms laugh uproariously all the way to the bank.<p>I sincerely doubt that the change will come from within. Not that there aren't people who work for those organizations who care passionately about the arts, who understand technology and its implications in significant and meaningful ways, who generally have their hearts in the right places. There will be a place for them in the arts economy of the future, but somebody new will be signing their cheques (or bitcoins).<p>The decision-makers at the top are the ones who give off the impression that they'd prefer to hide in their opulent executive chambers, doing their damndest to legislate their competitors out of existence, and ultimately bleed to death, gripping stacks of money, gold bullion spilling from their pockets, then actually compete on the free market, and perhaps die an honorable death.<p>The Guardian conducted an interview with electronic music pioneer, brilliant composer, omni-talented artist and all-around genius Brian Eno last year, wherein he stated the following:<p>""I think records were just a little bubble through time and those who made a living from them for a while were lucky. There is no reason why anyone should have made so much money from selling records except that everything was right for this period of time. I always knew it would run out sooner or later. It couldn't last, and now it's running out. I don't particularly care that it is and like the way things are going. The record age was just a blip. It was a bit like if you had a source of whale blubber in the 1840s and it could be used as fuel. Before gas came along, if you traded in whale blubber, you were the richest man on Earth. Then gas came along and you'd be stuck with your whale blubber. Sorry mate  history's moving along.""<p>Two important points here:<p>1. This was going to happen no matter what. These firms rose to prominence during an odd period in the ongoing history of our world civilization when ideas, emotions, and artistic expressions could be recorded, duplicated, and feasibly distributed to consumers around the world. They happened to exist at an exact moment on the timeline when it was just cheap enough that it could be accomplished, but just expensive enough that a large firm was required to organize workers, consolidate (what was, at the time, very expensive) equipment, and coordinate distribution to drive marginal costs down. That moment in time is passing. Marginal costs to produce and distribute media are rapidly approaching zero.<p>2. The inevitability of these changes in market conditions is no reason to vilify media conglomerates. They did just spend about 60 years betting on <i>all</i> the wrong horses, but no one could <i>know</i> that the Internet (and all it entails) was coming.  The reason to vilify these organizations lies in their reactions to these changes. I'm not going to go down the list, suffice it to say that much resentment towards labels/studios/production groups/etc. has built up, not just on behalf of artists and others with a dog in the fight, but in average consumers. That resentment just didn't exist a decade or two ago. The ""rights-holders"" fought the inevitable, and now not only are they going to lose, but they've so antagonized their customersthe only people who may have been able to prop them up long-term if only due to sympathythat people who previously wouldn't have given a shit are now positively giddy at the idea of someone like Jim Gianopulos standing, defeated and alone, with nothing but a stupid look on his face and all his fucking whale blubber.<p>I assert that in no way is the continued existence of these lumbering, bumbling, crumbling dinosaurs a requisite condition for humans to have the opportunity to create, distribute, access or enjoy art, in any of its forms, anywhere.<p>I'll be happy to watch them suffer, and eventually die.

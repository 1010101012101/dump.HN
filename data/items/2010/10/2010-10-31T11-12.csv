1853098,comment,1844986,1847640,0,0,igravious,,,"Thanks for continuing this conversation with me. Lets put aside ideology for a moment and talk about facts.<p>>This is because you're seeing it as some kind of ideology. It isn't. It's a loss leader. You see people doing loss leader all over the place (e.g. milk sold below cost, gaming consoles, television for free but with commercials, etc., etc.), do you think there is a growing trend of people who want to pay you for using their product? Of course not, it's part of a larger strategy. Just like open source.<p>Because with open source software you get unhindered access to the source code and because sending bits over the internet is very cheap it is seen as pointless to charge for the media. But open source software charge and make a very fine business from support. Your example of milk is odd because farming is subsidized, something that a lot of people find unfair but that is necessary so that you don't become agriculturally subservient to someone who suddenly becomes your enemy. And what does milk lead to? Cheese? Gaming consoles, yes. But apparently Nintendo never has. Television programming uses the business model of advertising just like a whole bunch of websites do. This does not mean that your television programs are loss leaders because what do they lead to? Consoles lead to games. Programs lead to more programs which the advertisers like cuz they like eyeballs. With advertising you are the product, the advertisers are the customer. This is why probably you get better programming from subscription channels because they are not as beholden to their customers (the advertisers) but this is all beside the point. The example that is kind of true reinforces my point about software being exorbitantly priced.<p>>Microsoft dwarfs Redhat in every meaningful way. Are you comparing stock prices between the two [1]? And if you want to talk about the champion of proprietary software I think Apple has a better stake on that claim. They just recently blew past Microsoft in market cap (the metric you should be looking at if you're trying to judge valuation of a company).<p>It's not about size. It is about your return on your stock investment in terms of the share price going up and not down, and the dividends on the shares. The data I gave you showed that Redhat's shares have outperformed Microsoft's shares over the last 5 years even though Microsoft is phenomenally profitable. What does that tell you? I don't know about dividends, I haven't looked that up. Your talk about Apple is beside the point because I am not talking about market cap. Sure market cap gives you one evaluation of a company but so do lots of other things such as stock movement, volume of trading, price to earnings ratio and a whole bunch of other things. Judging things by just how ""big"" they are is not a great way to go about educating yourself.<p>>Redhat isn't remotely relevant to Microsoft. MS is worried about Google and Apple. I wouldn't be surprised if Ballmer didn't even know Redhat was still around as a company.<p>You are joking aren't? What is Microsft's main source of revenue. It was spelled out in this article. Windows and Office. Has been for years. Redhat competes with Windows in the enterprise. They are a direct competitor of Microsoft's cash cow. Apple is too but only kind of because Macos is not a general purpose OS and always comes wrapped in shiny hardware and so doesn't compete directly with Microsoft. It's more the other way, as Microsoft expands beyond its cash cows it enters the turf of others, into music devices or web search for instance. And Apple kind of proves my point cuz Darwin and LLVM are open source projects that Apple heavily invests in so gives them a competitive advantage. Check out <a href=""http://www.apple.com/opensource/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/opensource/</a> ""As the first major computer company to make Open Source development a key part of its ongoing software strategy, Apple remains committed to the Open Source development model.

Inevitably, there will be lots of up-voting, lots of agreement, lots of influence <i>regardless of what they actually say</i>. Introducing real names would exacerbate this effect.

I can't stop people from using drugs.<p>However, oversimplified statements made to dazzle, like yours, really tick me. There are many kinds and definitions of a <i>drug</i>, depending on whether you're a pharmacologist, a lawyer, a government, an addict, or just your average simpleton. There's not a single precise definition. I've already stated elsewhere in this thread that people need to jump off the legalization/damnation bandwagons and have some concrete fucking clue about what they're talking about.<p>Creating safe markets for <i>all</i> drugs? We haven't even been able to do that for pharmaceuticals! How do you suggest we proceed with recreational drugs? Where are consumers supposed to buy it from? What about existing supply-chains? Who oversees them all? What about derivatives? How will you figure out what is actually dangerous? Take a second and read Steve Yegge [1]; I'm sure you already have the answers but maybe he has a better chance of making you think.<p>I don't know where you come from, but where I live drug users can both make an informed decision <i>before</i> using (being critical thinking beings and all that shit), as well as get guidance and support after actually being addicted. It doesn't help. Sure, educating people about recreational drugs is <i>key</i>, but we don't even know half of what drugs are capable of when it comes to psychotropics. We are missing fundamental links between substance and behaviour, what are we supposed to tell our kids?<p>Anyway, I might have to put sarcasm tags in the last post, because being humorous or sarcastic really doesn't reach people here.

Americans tend to think of Travel in terms of the Caribbean Cruise.  A cruise lasts seven days and costs $5,000.  Therefore, traveling costs $5,000 per week.  Therefore I must have spent about $250k on my last trip.  ""How do you afford that?""<p>No, travel costs $500-$1000 per month unless you go out of your way to make it cost more.<p><pre><code>  - They're not actually going to kill you for being American

The latter brings in portions of the other systems into the economic model in order to better reflect the workings of the real world organism.<p>Economics is about the study of choice; but we can split that up into at least two broad categories, the most efficient choices, and the actual choices made by people. You can stay strictly within a so-called rational model for the first - and you must, in order to justify the inputs to your utility function - but the second is experimental, and relies on observed inputs necessarily defined by disciplines other than economics.<p>The insight of behavioural economics is that it's not so much rational maximization of gains that drives us, but rather imperfect mechanisms implemented in the organism, whose outcomes have been tuned by evolution to approach rational maximization.

We would still be using Nokias and Blackberries, or Android phones which would be like Blackberries -- not the iPhone.<p>As far as paying for R&D goes, how much does it take to replicate something? I'd say a fraction of the cost since you already have the product in front of you. All you need to do is duplicate it.",1288523185

1853053,story,,,40,57,hasenj,"Ask HN: Is Facebook benefiting from a ponzi scheme? a bubble?",,"In PG's essay about ""what happend to yahoo"":<p>> By 1998, Yahoo was the beneficiary of a de facto Ponzi scheme. Investors were excited about the Internet. One reason they were excited was Yahoo's revenue growth. So they invested in new Internet startups. The startups then used the money to buy ads on Yahoo to get traffic. Which caused yet more revenue growth for Yahoo, and further convinced investors the Internet was worth investing in.<p>Is Facebook in a similar situation today? They're not profitable, but investors are investing in them. They even acquire startups!!<p>As far as I can tell, all of Facebook's money comes from investments. They're getting bigger, but not because of any revenue they're actually making.<p>The founders got rich.<p>So economically, how does this work?<p>It seems to me like a bubble phenomenon:<p>Investment money => grow bigger => more investments.<p>The guys at the top of the pyramid benefit the most.<p>No actual revenue is being made.<p>I don't even know if they have a viable business model. I don't know the details of whether or not they're profitable yet, or how much they're making, but from what I'm reading around, they're either not profitable or the revenue they're actually making is very small. (Please do correct me).",1288522919

For me at least, therefor, it was far more easier to develop on an Atari and then a Linux PC than it ever was for Apple's machines (before OSX).",1288522908

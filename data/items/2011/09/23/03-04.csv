What does that make it now, an outstanding rape/international extradition case, a massive falling out with Domscheit-Berg, the Guardian unredacted document leak and now this. I'm missing a lot more, I'm sure. Agree with him or not, you gotta feel for Julian Assange.<p>I met his biological father once at a party about a year ago. We didn't talk in much detail (""hey, so your son's under house arrest"" isn't the best conversation starter) but he seemed cautiously upbeat and if nothing else proud of Julian. It was a strange reminder that despite all this he's still just a guy, like any of us, trying change the world for the better. Except we're not under house arrest with an international funds embargo and lawsuits circling like buzzards. He's still just a guy. I wonder how he's doing?<p>All these troubles can't be unconnected. I wonder if it's a fundamental result of his personality or his methods. That would be a tempting answer, but I'm not sure it's entirely true. Similarly tempting would be to assume that it's all pressure from the remarkable US political machine. But that's not entirely true either. I'd wager there's even some component of ""Julian Assange, transnational wounded deer"" - no country to back him up, no multi-million dollar board to sit on and nurse his wounds. He is, in that sense, uniquely vulnerable; alone among the infamous.<p>Julian once said that he volunteered to be the lightning rod of WikiLeaks. Well, here's the lightning. WikiLeaks will go on even as he burns, but what of the man? Is it fair to ask one person to be the punching bag for an idea? Is it fair for him to ask that of himself?",1316750120

If you assume that there can be other forces (for lack of  better word) faster than the speed of light, those forces would rarely interact with the physical universe governed by the speed of light, but when they do they could conceivably generate an interference pattern that could perturb other like particles across vast distances.  So theoretically if the neutrinos generated at the source interacted with some faster than light force, the result could be perturbation of neutrinos close to the detectors, making it appear that the  neutrinos actually arrived earlier than expected. \nI'm looking into this theory as a means of explaining black holes.",1316748683

I did the same trick as submitter in my self-funding days: all expenses other than rent were deferred for a year.  I paid them back once I raised funding (and had the company failed, could have covered it all with a few months salary at a paid job).<p>However, as the submitter mentioned, any cash advance, balance transfer, etc. typically incurs at least 3% interest and/or transfer fees which really hurts potential returns.  I'd be amazed if you can find a way to buy any investment vehicle with a credit card, forcing you to use the 3+% cash advance.<p>When you further factor in the time it takes up cards and the low credit limits you'll likely get, this strategy probably won't be worth it.",1316747636

3028687,comment,3028547,3028626,12,0,silentbicycle,,,"How does kqueue compare to epoll on Linux? I've written C code using kqueue on OpenBSD and OS X, but have only used epoll via libev (and not at especially high load). I thought the big change came from trading level- for edge-triggered nonblocking IO, but maybe the kqueue implementation is superior for sockets somehow?<p>The main advantage Erlang has over C/Python/Ruby/etc. is that asynchronous IO is the default <i>throughout all its libraries</i>, and it has a novel technique for handling errors. Its asynchronous design is ultimately about fault tolerance, not raw speed. Also, it can automatically and intelligently handle a lot of asynchronous control flow that node.js makes you manage by hand (which is so 70s!).<p>You can make event-driven asynchronous systems pretty smoothly in languages with first class coroutines/continuations (like Lua and Scheme), but most libraries aren't written with that use case in mind. Erlang's pervasive immutability also makes actual parallelism easier.<p>With that many connections, another big issue is space usage -- keeping buffers, object overhead, etc. low per connection.  Some languages fare far, far better than others here.",1316747307

It requires admitting that you can't necessarily have both a great app and search engine indexible app.<p>Google may succeed with NaCL, but I don't see how anyone else will.

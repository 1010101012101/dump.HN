Though I wonder if it is just helping to manage the symptons rather than addressing the source of the depression. Procrastination may be a sympton and not the cause of depression.\nUnfortunately, for many people mental illness and depression is a result of very real chemical imbalances in the brain.

It&#x27;s certainly a little cramped by suburban American standards, but is table stakes in Europe and elsewhere in the world.<p>It&#x27;s the same way we all lived in my native USSR, though the apartments there tended to be larger and more rationally subdivided into lots of little rooms (so, an apartment with three rooms with closing doors, plus effectively a fourth room in the form of a kitchen, plus a foyer hallway, was a commonplace thing). My biggest annoyance with American apartment floor plans is the intense compulsion to imitate houses -- a door straight into a large combined living room and kitchen area. I&#x27;d gladly trade that for more compartmentalised rooms, and a layout that doesn&#x27;t require someone entering the apartment to walk through space where someone else is hanging out.",1448258211

Being able to read, interpret, understand, and, eventually, modify other peoples&#x27; code is a foundational skill both for industry and open source work.  Reading code is often harder than writing code, too, so it&#x27;s a worthwhile outlet for your natural curiosity, too.  (For <i>this</i>  particular mystery, you also could have tried Git&#x27;s own tracing via setting GIT_TRACE=1 in your environment; many tools, especially ones that work over a network, offer some kind of debugging or tracing).<p>I tend to keep a copy of glibc, Python, coreutils, openssl, and binutils laying around for random grep&#x27;ing.

It is also true that the U.S. is not perfect. Far from it: I&#x27;m sure many Russian commenters have some words about the western-bred neoliberal experts who preached &quot;Shock Therapy&quot; to Yeltsin (Spoiler alert: oligarchs).<p>The difference between China and the US, in my opinion, lies in their motivations and how it translates into economic action. The West, like other &quot;enlightened&quot; spheres before it, has had some element of &quot;for the greater good&quot; guiding its vision. One historical example is that instead of colonizing Europe after WW2 (like the Soviets did), the US instituted the Marshall Plan. You can argue that this aid was given in exchange for a degree of suzerainty ( don&#x27;t bomb NATO! ). Fundamentally, however, those states regained their status as independent actors and were not seen as extensions of the US.<p>Security is very much the heart of the matter here, it&#x27;s the age-old question of &quot;how much control does the government need over its spheres to feel secure and therefore strong?&quot;. Although not always spoken, a country normally ought to be as protectionist over its trade as it is weak in that area of trade. In the U.S., it happened with Japan and Cars as the article points out, and Great Britain and textiles if one goes back even further.<p>With this rationale in mind, Xi Jingping insists that China is still &quot;developing&quot;[1], that China can be excused for so-and-so action to maintain its economy, even though it wields more power than almost all other &quot;developing nations&quot; in the same space put together.<p>What&#x27;s often overlooked is that it&#x27;s not just economic (in)securities at play here. China demands the submission of foreign companies because China is <i>politically</i> insecure. Consider a related section from the &quot;X Article&quot;:<p>> Easily persuaded of their own doctrinaire &quot;rightness,&quot; they insisted on the submission or destruction of all competing power. Outside of the Communist Party, Russian society was to have no rigidity. There were to be no forms of collective human activity or association which would not be dominated by the Party. No other force in Russian society was to be permitted to achieve vitality or integrity. Only the Party was to have structure. All else was to be an amorphous mass. [2]<p>Although China hasn&#x27;t been at this totalitarian stage for a long while, the concept of &quot;amorphousness&quot;, that the only &quot;true&quot; political form is the central power and all else exists in service to it, is one of China&#x27;s current most debilitating problems. If you don&#x27;t have multiple organizations each with their own sphere of  power, how can you express the multifaceted will of your citizenry (the definition of a functional civil society)?  While the Chinese people have to date built many forms [3],  the central government is certain to come down hard on any actual power of the forms as fast as they develop. [4].<p>To summarize: China acts with greater force internally because China&#x27;s leaders are afraid. Very afraid. First, they don&#x27;t have the same political mechanisms for dealing with foreign political influences that the U.S. has. In more concrete terms: the last time they allowed for other forms, in the same way the U.S. did and does, came just before their tanks crushed students underfoot in their nice, government square. History in mind, China&#x27;s leaders have continually resorted to harsh action in all spheres to maintain their form, which they cannot bear to be without.<p>[1] \n<a href=""http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/09/25/is-china-still-a-developing-country/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/09/25/is-china-still-a-develop...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/1947-07-01/sources-soviet-conduct"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/1...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/china/21600747-spite-political-clampdown-flourishing-civil-society-taking-hold-beneath-glacier"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/news/china/21600747-spite-political...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/05/08/dispatches-china-tightens-screws-civil-society"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/05/08/dispatches-china-tighten...</a>",1448257297

They pack an insane amount of complexity into their games then provide utterly feeble tools to manage it or refuse to invest time into them as that complexity grows from game to game (especially their inventory system which hasn&#x27;t changed much since Oblivion). Nothing demonstrates this better than Fallout 4&#x27;s base building mechanic which is leagues better (and more complicated) than in any other game I&#x27;ve played. You can literally build a downtown Sanctuary with a dozen 10 story tall skyscrapers with farmland and electrical infrastructure but doing so using the Workshop as it is now (months before the release of the official game editor) is absolutely maddening and down right impractical. No 2d map or overhead camera, no alignment with complex terrain like building foundations, no templating, zero interface to manage the settlers (the current community concensus is to give each settler a different hat or outfit for each available job!), and it&#x27;s just down right Unintuitive in every way. The mechanic overall feels like it was part of the game design from day 1 but the interface they give you to use it was made in a weekend.<p>Bethesda knows their games are bought for replayability and community mods so it seems that they make a lot of sacrifices no other gaming company would, knowing that the more annoying it is the faster some modder will totally replace it with far superior execution. To be fair though, no other company cranks out fantastic open world games that are as good as Bethesda&#x27;s on such a regular basis. All of this pays off when a five year old game has graphics as good as a newly released one except with half a decade of damn near professional effort by thousands of modders.",1448256889

People simply had to work.

If you haven&#x27;t worked out how to do it manually, then when your automated solution fails to work, it&#x27;s going to be much easier to troubleshoot if you know the basics.<p>Hence why I prefer things like OOCSS over Bootstrap, Capistrano over Docker. Bootstrap forces your markup to conform to your framework, drowning you in incoherent class names that are going to flee your mind the second you have to remember why you put them there. OOCSS makes you treat your markup and CSS holistically, so that when it comes time to troubleshoot a browser bug, you can easily apprehend what your markup was supposed to do and why you did it that way.<p>Docker automates things that don&#x27;t <i>really</i> need to be automated, unless you&#x27;ve got the kind of problem that really could make use of Docker&#x27;s abstractions.

Then the CPC came, and said it was better. At last Performance arrived, and we could finally really know our ROI.<p>Well, when talking about Instagram and Social Media in general, we are back to the stone age – marketing speaking. Companies and Marketing Managers are paying Social Media Stars basing their fees on the number of followers (the CPM of Social Networks) without having a real metric able to measure the engagement of the stars’ audience. Yes, you can monitor your organic traffic growth. Yes, you can check if you got any more sales. But can you do anything before running the campaign?<p>Through daily monitoring most of the Instagram accounts out there, at Popular Chips we created advanced metrics like FPL and FPC (how many followers are required to generate a like or a Comment) and two quality scores, by which we rank Instagram influencers.<p>The Overall Score (or Absolute Score) indicates how wide the audience of the stars is and the level of this audience’s engagement. This means that we are looking at a combination of how many followers they have, how many comments and likes they receive. There is no surprise that the top positions of this ranking are real-life celebrities like Selena Gomez, Taylor Swift and Kendall Jenner.<p>The Relative Score indicates how strong the bond between social influencers and their audience is, independently of the audience’s size. This gives you an idea of the audience’s quality. In this case, minor celebrities run the show; as we could expect, bigger celebrities have weaker bonds with their audience than smaller influencers.<p>Have a look for example at the top Instagram stars: \nhttp://popularchips.com/top-instagram-influencers<p>Kinda different from just thinking about followers, right?<p>What you think?

At first it was really difficult to not misgender them and I would often use the pronouns that describe their sex designation. However, now that I have gotten used to it, it has opened up a whole new way of interacting with and categorizing people. Some interesting instances are when I try to make a joke about some attribute that is usually attributed to a certain sex (e.g. males are more into video games), I have to break down the link that I have made between a trait and a gender identity, and actually figure out what the actual connection is too. Turns out it&#x27;s usually independent of gender expression and actually some more specific trait.<p>Of course, this is just one specific category that we have to taught to recognize. I think it is incredibly valuable when dealing with humans to be able to unlearn the generalizations that we have been brought up to understand intuitively, and learn to treat people independently of the characterizations that society has incedentally bestowed on them.<p>There are other instances where language affects how people spend money[1], or how characterizing argument with war metaphors causes it to be more combative [citation lost to memory].

Even though the internet connects every computer on the planet directly, finding people to interact in the ways we want is difficult. We post things to Facebook and Twitter because that&#x27;s where our friends and like-minded strangers are actually looking for things.<p>To fight this, we tried federation. We tried building social systems that allowed people to choose their own provider but participate in the same network, but federation hasn&#x27;t worked since email. If you take a long look at email, you&#x27;ll see why: federated systems can&#x27;t keep up with the pace of evolution that we see in successful social systems. The design-test-iterate loop that design thinkers use to build products people want doesn&#x27;t work when the rest of the federated providers don&#x27;t keep up, and they never do.<p>Where federation failed, I believe decentralization will succeed. There is an honest-to-god renaissance happening right now in decentralized systems, and the tools to continue the internet dream are reaching maturity. Core to this renaissance is our new ability to use blockchains to establish universal cryptographic identities with no intermediary—no federated server to hold back the tide of progress. When you want new features, you don&#x27;t switch servers, you switch clients. They all speak the same peer-to-peer protocol using the same portable, blockchain-based identities. This has a very useful side-effect: systems that don&#x27;t rely on servers never shut down as long as people keep using them. Decentralized systems are forces of nature.<p>This combination makes network effects a public good. Second place companies in network effect industries today have their own private networks that just aren&#x27;t as useful. It is in their best interest to make their networks as large as possible, and treating the decentralized network as part or all of their network achieves that. It creates a network used by all the competitors who aren&#x27;t in first place, even as those competitors die off. I think the immortal network used by competitors will over time become as large as the front-runner&#x27;s. At equal size, the open network is more valuable than the closed one—the open one can be built wholesale into any other product that benefits from it. If you want, you can use a ride-hailing app that uses your social network connections to share rides with friends of friends instead of complete strangers, and anyone can build that app when the ride-hailing and social networks are decentralized.<p>When our industry gets great at creating decentralized application protocols, it will no longer be feasible to build a business on privately controlled network effects. It&#x27;s not a defensible business anymore. Users will be able to choose which clients they use instead of being forced to sacrifice their data to a company to benefit from its network.<p>The internet dream is back, y&#x27;all.

Politically, categories are mostly used to drive up the &quot;us vs. them&quot; tension factor that unifies groups, and pushing for harder-edged definitions of gender and gender roles is a convenient way to politicize just about everything in a human life.

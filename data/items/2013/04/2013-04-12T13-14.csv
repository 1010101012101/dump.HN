5538487,comment,5537770,5537770,6,0,molbioguy,,,"As others here have pointed out, ""Asperger's"" covers a broad spectrum of behaviors and it's not fair to a) put this label on anyone who displays some of the behaviors (that covers too many people), nor b) try to minimize the diversity of behaviors by focusing on just a few (the diversity is much, much greater).  The same thing happens with the horribly named ""gifted"" label. People only focus on the high achievers and completely miss the fact that not all gifted or Asperger's fit that stereotype. It's just so easy to label people and move on without really considering what's going on.

In Taiwan, for example, there are bicycle/scooter lanes on major arterials and special signage and traffic rules for scooters. Major intersections have 2-stage turn boxes exclusively for use by scooters and bikes, and there are scooter/bike boxes at the front of most traffic lights. A scooter is the fastest way to get around when there's traffic. The downside is that scooters are still very dangerous, since they still sometimes have to interact with large vehicles. A vehicle even shorter would be even worse.<p>The article focuses a lot on the energy efficiency of these velomobiles, but I would argue that the time people waste in traffic is a much more pressing problem. Reforming our infrastructure to support smaller vehicles and to give preference to public transit is the solution, and it has the additional advantage of making all kinds of more efficient transportation possible.",1365774658

If you are going to compare frameworks and you want to go beyond that initial performance metric, you might as well aim high enough to be useful.</i><p>The query 20 random rows, build an object, and return that, is way beyond requests per second.  Enough that the list is dramatically re-ordered.<p>> <i>That these benchmarks are laughable because all they measure is performance, and there's a clear performance to convenience trade-off shown in the results, and that of course there's a performance hit when the framework handles most the work for you. I have to say I agree.</i><p>On the contrary, performance versus magic is absolutely not a ""given"" here.  Yes, some bare languages are near the top, but there are also heavy frameworks (e.g. Spring) performing well, and lean frameworks performing poorly.<p>As for being ""laughable"", that makes me suspicious of the framework author's understanding of where optimization needs to happen.  Presumably, pages will be run more often than they are authored.  Presumably there's a recurring bill for the server farm.  Optimizing for performance helps end users stay happy, and helps the company stay in business able to continue employing developers.<p>> <i>possibly some that are clear winners giving good performance with lots of conveniences for common operations, but is there any way to tell as much from the data presented so far?</i><p>I agree with that point.  I would like to see 3 additional columns added to the results: LOC, number of src files/templates across number of directories, and number of libs.<p>This helps suss out your point: how much does a coder have to type in this framework, and how much incidental complexity (files, libs) do they have to wrap their heads around?<p>Consider:<p><pre><code>    [300 loc; 15 files  2 dirs;  8 libs]

    [150 loc; 15 files 15 dirs; 23 libs]

I don't like long abstract concepts, but rather keep it short and practical.
I don't know Matlab, but lets say you're teaching 'C'.
1 - hello world
2 - program to add two hardcoded numbers, display result
3 - program to accept two numbers, and write out result (same as #2, only process 'argc').
4 - program to write 'hello world' to file.
5 - program to read entire file into memory (hard-code buffer size to be big enough), and write it out to screen between '(' and ')'.
6 - something with a while loop, possibly reading any sized file, and printing it to screen line at a time, prefixed with line number
7 - for loop perhaps finding sum of all numbers between 1 and 100.
8 - some basic functions
9 - etc., one small step at a time.<p>That's what would work for me.
People who are smart are going to pick up on what you're doing and get ahead. People who aren't so smart won't get too lost.<p>The last thing I would say, is not to assume audience knows anything.

Holding two strong relationships with a total of three children with Asperger's or high functioning autism (ages: 3-6, 7-9, 10-12) and a few here and there, it has really broadened my view on the subject.<p>First, language is a barrier.  Social awkwardness naturally follows that barrier.  Trained social reflexes and loosely coupled connections and relationships. From an industry perspective, computer specialists seem to form a deeper relationship and bonds with the logical machine.<p>Social skills are a technical trait that can be trained... 'why are you looking at me while I use the urinal?'  In my experience, these children live on rules, and the rules define them as an adult. Computers are rule based too.<p>Zoning, stimming, and hyperfocusing seem to be common characteristics in the spectrum.  Countless hours spinning objects, humming notes, doing routines, slightly ocd to an extent.  Much like the caffeinated nights at the terminal for endless hours.<p>Multitasking as an obvious detour from an objective.  Focus on a, achieve a, move on to b. Multitasking skills are found in the ADHD varieties, but interestingly, my observation has been a determined rigorous approach to solve solutions.  Tinker until it is done.  Modify.  Read the rules manual word for word XOR ignore it completely.  We see this behavior in our field.<p>Egos and emotions.  Nothing more to say.<p>And I too have Asperger's syndrome.  I have never been formally diagnosed with testing, partly because it was unheard of in my time.  I visited a psych last year and she was shocked that my symptoms had not been tied to the spectrum.  Yet, I am a trained individual, hyperfocusing my way to my goals and have been without guidance.  My main issues stem from processing/speaking language.  I am strong willed, persistent, introverted, curious, clever, quirky, and shy.  I've self medicated my Asperger's and ADD with depression and anxiety... ruining my social reflection to the world.<p>The computer is my relationship.  It is my mind, body, and soul.  If something goes wrong, it is either my fault, someone's fault, or fixable.  No quirky social rules to interpret and apply to the problem.  Phone conferences in the phreaking days and IRC had my friends for the longest time.<p>The question 'is will/do you hire someone with Asperger's syndrome?', and the answer is: 'if they are qualified.'<p>Some of you will be parents soon.  If you see the signs, get your children enrolled in a speech therapy program.<p>Peak their interests with gears (KNEX), LEDs and motors and batteries, circular/cylindrical objects, simple math/chemistry in the home.<p>The sooner the rules begin to form, the less the fear applies, grabs hold, and ruins the experience.

I grew up in Appalachia (West Virginia/southwestern Virginia line) and when I'm at home or with friends/relatives, my natural dialect is potent.<p>However, over many years, starting in late high school, I trained myself to speak in a more standard form of English to protect myself from the discrimination of the ""hillbilly"" stigma.  This is my formal dialect, and I use it in business and in formal/sem-formal scholastic settings.  My father was the one who encouraged me to do this.  As a child, I noticed that he spoke differently when making business calls.  He told me that, when ""you are trying to make money, trying to learn to make money, or dealing with somebody who wants your money, you speak their language.""  \nThis knowledge of using a non-native, standard dialect in business/government/education communications is extremely common, and is especially common amongst the mainstream African American community.  The issue with AAVE is only when children are raised in broken families by parents who are too ignorant/disengaged/etc to teach children the standard, formalized dialect that every other ethnic group in America is expected to adhere to.  I can't speak in a courtroom in my native dialect and be taken seriously, even if I'm in Charleston, West Virginia.  (The exceptions to this are in identity politics.  Lots of deep southern politicians use their native accent, and then there is the Charleston dialect, which uses proper grammar but drops the ""r's"", so is therefore acceptable in formal settings.)",1365773582

I think people underestimate how valuable a <i>good</i> agent can be. They know problem signs when buying a house, they know the market and they know how to negotiate. My mom helped us by a townhome and then build a house and it was an incredibly eye opening experience. I was used to my mom being the sweet, nurturing woman I grew up with, but when it came to negotiating she turned into a pitbull. When we bought our townhome, she knew the market, she knew what areas were better. When we built our house, she was able to guide in a way to maximize the bang for our buck. Things that were cheap and add a lot of value to do when building, but not cheap to retrofit.<p>Thinking that using a site like redfin or zillow is going to make up for the depth of experience is just frankly silly. Would you negotiate a Series A with a bunch of forms from LegalZoom? No, you'd be an idiot to not have an experienced attorney on your side.<p>Edit: The cool thing about real estate agents (unlike attorneys) is that the great ones charge just as much as the bad ones.

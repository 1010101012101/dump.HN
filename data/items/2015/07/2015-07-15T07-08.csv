2) (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b<p>such that three laws hold:<p>a) return x >>= f == f x
b) m >>= return == m
c) (m >>= f) >>= g == m >>= (\x -> f x >>= g)<p>For monads in Haskell, this is the technically correct definition.<p>That said, most people will tell you the best way to understand monads is to look at a few basic monad instance implementations (Maybe, Either a) and program with them, slowly learning new instances.",1436946565

Surely someone must have come up with a better one by now?<p>Instead we get nice &quot;English&quot; names which only work for certain monad instances and fail to adequately describe others.<p>Elm uses &quot;andThen&quot; instead of &quot;bind&quot;, which works pretty well for the monadic types in its core library.

Honestly, I&#x27;m fine with &quot;andThen&quot;, especially in the context of Elm and the monads it implicitly uses. But in the wider world of programming where exotic but useful monad instances exist I&#x27;d rather stick to the most general name.<p>By the way, the more pressing reason for Elm not having monads is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have typeclasses (or a similar concept) and doesn&#x27;t allow you to parametrize over higher-kinded types (like Maybe).",1436945863

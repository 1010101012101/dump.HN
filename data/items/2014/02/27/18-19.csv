I don&#x27;t expect an immediate response, but I set a rebump for a day later (default is 3 days) because I shouldn&#x27;t have to chase you down to get a simple answer.<p>Definitely see your point about how annoying it would be to get these one email forwards from my great-aunt, though.

It&#x27;s the crab bucket culture, and is highly destructive to individual growth.<p>There may be valid reasons for such a culture to exist, but for the most part, they do not apply in rich industrial nations.  China, for instance, is about to feel some cultural growing pains thanks to its generation under the One Child Policy and its increasing urban industrialization.<p>Once a strong family network is no longer necessary for individual prosperity, it tends to collapse back down to a smaller, more manageable size.

7314126,comment,7313461,7313461,3,0,smartbear,,,"This is the Founder of WP Engine.<p>The main points in the article are factually incorrect, but some of it is in fact excellent feedback that we&#x27;re going to act on.<p>First, on staging areas, it is incorrect that they are counted as duplicate content, because we force a &quot;deny robots everything&quot; robots.txt file on staging. Using the example from the article of our TorqueMag website: <a href=""http://torque.staging.wpengine.com/robots.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://torque.staging.wpengine.com/robots.txt</a><p>It&#x27;s true that some bots will ignore robots.txt, but all the major search engines that matter for SEO, which is the point of the article, do honor it. Some -- including Google! -- will <i>scan</i> it anyway, but it doesn&#x27;t count for duplicate content. Matt Cutts has been extremely clear on this point, publicly.<p>Second, on duplicate content on the WP Engine domains (e.g. torque.wpengine.com), again what was stated is factually incorrect <i>for Google</i> but <i>is</i> a good point for some other search engines. Here&#x27;s why:<p>Google maintains a set of root domains that they know are companies that do exactly what we and many other hosting companies do. Included in that list are WordPress.com, SquareSpace, and us. When they detect &quot;duplicate content&quot; on subdomains from that list, they know that&#x27;s not actually duplicate content. You can see it in Google Search, but it&#x27;s not counted against you.<p>We have had a dialog directly with Matt Cutts on this point, so this is not conjecture, but fact.<p>However, the suggestion from the article that it&#x27;s better to 301 that domain is still <i>also</i> very valid. Also, not all search engines are aware of this scenario, and thus one of the take-aways we have from this article is that we should auto-force robots.txt for the XYZ.wpengine.com domains just as we do for the staging domains, so that other search engines won&#x27;t be confused.<p>So in the end, we came away with a good idea of how to improve.  It&#x27;s a shame the point had to be made in the manner that it was, and intermixed with FUD.",1393527297

7314102,comment,7311818,7313428,3,0,minimax,,,"Sure. Let&#x27;s start with dealers. A dealer is a party that stands ready to buy or sell something (in this case bitcoins). When you want to transact, you ring up the dealer and ask for a quote. The quote is composed of a price at which the dealer will buy bitcoins and a price at which the dealer will sell bitcoins. If you like the price, you do the deal. So throughout the day, the dealer is constantly buying and selling. The difference between the buy and sell price gives the dealer his profit. If a dealer decides he is building up too much inventory, he may, for example, lower his bid price (widening out the spread) so that fewer parties will be interested in selling to him. That&#x27;s the basic idea of a dealer.<p>Now exchanges. The idea with an exchange is to match up a plurality of buyers and sellers. Exchange participants can send in orders to buy or sell a specific quantity at a given price (these are called limit orders). These orders are all combined and sorted by price into a <i>limit order book</i>. If you look around at some of the bitcoin exchange sites most of them will show you the state of the book†. When you look at a quote at an exchange you are really looking at the highest priced buy order (or the aggregate of all orders at that price) and the lowest price sell order. When market participants wish to transact immediately, they can send in a marketable order, meaning that buyers will pay the best offered price or sellers will pay the best bid price. Marketable orders &quot;cross the spread&quot;. The exchange is responsible for updating the book and distributing it to market participants, but the exchange itself doesn&#x27;t do any buying or selling. Exchanges take a percentage fee of each transaction which is the source of an exchange&#x27;s profits.<p>Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m a bitcoin miner. My mining machinery creates bitcoins out of electricity but I still need dollars to pay the utility bill. This makes me a natural seller of bitcoins. When I go to sell my bitcoins, I want to get the best price for them. I might post a limit order to sell at what I think is a reasonable price on an exchange and wait for my order to get hit. I might also look at the lowest offer price and decide to post my bitcoins for sale at a penny less in order to increase the probability of getting my order filled quickly. This kind of limit order trading is only available at an exchange. If I could only transact with a dealer, I&#x27;d have to either cross the spread and accept the dealer&#x27;s bid or not do a deal at all.<p>† For example: <a href=""https://www.bitstamp.net/market/order_book/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bitstamp.net/market/order_book/</a>",1393527091

7314095,comment,7313582,7313582,7,0,pvnick,,,"This is a great article. I&#x27;m always in favor of flexible and scientific approaches to dieting. Lyle McDonald wrote a great series of articles on why diets fail (hint: it&#x27;s a hormone called leptin) [1]. Caloric deficits lead to decreasing leptin, which explains why you feel like crap when dieting because this leads to metabolic slowdown by downregulating things like your immune system (why you get sick more when you diet) and reproductive system (why you lose your sex drive). Leptin&#x27;s effects on the hunger-controlling hypothalamus explain why you may obsess over calorie-dense junk foods when you diet. It&#x27;s your body&#x27;s protection against starvation, but it goes all haywire in our obesogenic (obesity-causing) environment.<p>So what&#x27;s the best way to acutely raise leptin levels when they&#x27;re depressed from caloric restriction? Flexible diet solutions like the ones talked about in the article. High-carb &quot;refeeds&quot; - some people call them cheat days - are particularly helpful [2]. The trick is to binge on carbs (not fat!!!) while remaining at a caloric deficit, which is where a calorie journal definitely comes in handy. Things like sweet potatoes and pasta will fill you up and replete your leptin levels.<p>As an aside, while we&#x27;re talking about leptin and flexible dieting, intermittent fasting is wonderful for flexible dieting. I&#x27;m working on a website right now that&#x27;s based on the leangains method [3], which is great for folks in the moderately overweight category. For severely overweight or obese folks, Dr. Krista Varady (who I had the pleasure of speaking with on the phone recently), has published a ton of research on intermittent fasting over the past decade and just wrote a book called the Every Other Day Diet [4], which I <i>highly</i> recommend for anyone trying to lose a lot of weight quickly and safely and keep it off.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/the-hormones-of-bodyweight-regulation-leptin-part-the-last.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/the-hormones-of-bo...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11126336"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11126336</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.leangains.com/2010/03/intermittent-fasting-set-point-and.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leangains.com/2010/03/intermittent-fasting-set-po...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Every-Other-Day-Diet-That-Weight/dp/1401324932"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Every-Other-Day-Diet-That-Weight/d...</a>",1393527021

So, even with the sex thing, you might not be embarrassed, but the information can and will be presented in a way to maximize your pain. You might not care about people knowing you ate a bunch of dicks, but your opponent is going to cast it, for example, as non-consensual, or will dig up some dirt on the sex partners. Perhaps they are under-age, non-consenting, or willing (with a little inducement) to simply lie about what you did.<p>Bottom line: information is power, and even lack of shame cannot protect you from the damage it can do in malicious hands.<p>(BTW your point is well taken.

In one study, he triggered heart arrhythmias. Then, using the right modulations of the frequency, he even stopped frog hearts with microwaves—stopped the hearts dead.<p>&quot;Frey observed two factors in how microwaves at low power could affect living systems. First, there was the carrier wave: a frequency of 1,900 megahertz, for example, the same frequency of many cell phones today. Then there was the data placed on the carrier wave—in the case of cell phones, this would be the sounds, words, and pictures that travel along it. When you add information to a carrier wave, it embeds a second signal—a second frequency—within the carrier wave. This is known as modulation. A carrier wave can support any number of modulations, even those that match the \u00ADextra-low frequencies at which the brain operates (between eight and twenty hertz). It was modulation, Frey discovered, that induced the widest variety of biological effects.&quot;<p>Well that&#x27;s food for thought!

All we have is government and our legal framework; nothing about what we can or can&#x27;t do exists outside of that[1]. Philosophers have looked at this many times[2], and none have managed to come up with a satisfactory definition of &#x27;rights&#x27; that works. Consequently all we have to work with when it comes to saying what we can do, what we have the &#x27;right&#x27; to do, and perhaps more importantly what the government can do, is the law. Really, the problem is that governments are tasked with limiting their own power over us; surrendering power is something that very few people are good at.<p>[1] There&#x27;s morals and ethics, but that&#x27;s what you <i>should</i> do rather than what you <i>can</i> do.<p>[2] If you&#x27;re interested, I highly recommend reading about Jeremy Bentham who wrote about the topic more than 200 years ago: <a href=""http://www.iep.utm.edu/bentham/#SH5b"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iep.utm.edu/bentham/#SH5b</a>",1393524101

However, a few comments for people looking to do the same:<p>- Ignoring the 3D nature of antenna placement, you need to model the concrete walls properly to get an answer that is semi reliable. All materials have frequency dependent reflection and transmission (attentuation) coefficients. Its pretty easy to extend a toy FDTD sim to include these.<p>- For the reasons above, inferring 2.4Ghz behaviour from ~1GHz (30cm) signal isn&#x27;t really a good thing to do (even in a &quot;hand waving&quot; manner).<p>- When displaying E-fields, you usually want to plot the ||E||^2 averaged over one complete wave cycle -- the nodes shouldn&#x27;t jump around. If they do, it means the simulation hasn&#x27;t reached a steady state.<p>Cheers!",1409032341

8225853,comment,8221703,8225432,2,0,enjo,,,"The answer is a definite maybe. One common language definition of probable cause:<p>> An officer has probable cause for a search where the facts and circumstances would lead a reasonable person to believe that there was a likelihood that the object to be searched contained contraband or evidence of a crime.<p>In a state where medical marijuana is not legal the card might be interpreted to mean that there is a likelihood that the person in the car has pot on them. They can establish that this person uses marijuana (why else would they have the card), is unreasonable to think that they might not carry it with them?<p>I don&#x27;t think there is a ton of case-law here. One notable instance happened in California. In People v. Waxler an officer approached a car that smelled of marijuana. The defendant in the case admitted to smoking pot, but produced a medical card making the claim that it was legal for him to do so. Interestingly the court ruled that even when a card was present the police still have probable cause to search as they are allowed to ascertain wether or not the marijuana was legally purchased from within the medical system and wether or not the suspect is not in possession of pot in excess of the medical limit.<p>While that is a state court ruling, you might expect similar logic is applied to states where medical pot isn&#x27;t legal. In those cases the presence of of a card might be interpreted as probable cause. Since the odor of pot alone is enough for a search, any cop who sees a card is very likely to claim to smell it as well anyways. After all they&#x27;re not going to get a lot of pushback on the claim if they have defacto evidence that you&#x27;re using marijuana anyways.",1409031559

They have almost half a million employees worldwide, not considering the many thousands of contractors. That&#x27;s 5x more people than Apple.<p>IBM is in the business of 1) selling people&#x27;s time, and 2) selling some software, to justify selling even more of people&#x27;s time. Hardware is not a priority anymore.<p>Those who have worked in professional services industry know there&#x27;s a cap on how much you can charge for each employee. Maybe 2-3x the salary, which will get you to the $200-250K range. Maybe a bit more if you have teams with unique skills (e.g., lawyers, scientists, creative talents), but nothing even close to the revenue per capita that a product-based company commands.<p>Case in point: IBM just got to #1 position on AdAge&#x27;s ranking of digital marketing agencies [1]. Yes, digital marketing agency. A few years ago they weren&#x27;t even showing up in the rankings.<p>Apple, on the other hand, is in the business of creating products out of hardware + software. That requires a much smaller scale, given that 80% of the manufacturing is outsourced. So when you look at the revenue per employee, you&#x27;ll end up with much bigger numbers.<p>But a better comparison would be to add <i>all</i> the employees of Apple&#x27;s direct suppliers. Just Foxconn, for example, has 1.29M employees and 40% of its revenue coming from Apple. Add it all up, and things start to look a lot more similar to IBM.<p>[1] <a href=""http://adage.com/article/agency-news/2014-agency-report-revenue-staffing-stocks-digital/292849/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adage.com/article/agency-news/2014-agency-report-reve...</a>",1409031555

8225837,comment,8219721,8225634,1,0,glenra,,,"I&#x27;m only saying to completely remove security altogether with respect to how we treat the PASSENGERS. That is, when people walk into a plane let them be &quot;protected&quot; to much the same degree as when they walk down the street or get on a bus or a train. Protected by a little sensible thought put into how the environment is designed and a little faith in human nature, not at all protected by strip searches and behavior rules written out in minute detail and a legion of guards with uzis wearing camo on every corner.<p>In response to prior experience with hijackers, pre-9/11 &quot;security&quot; primarily involved disarming the passengers and training passengers and crew alike that they should act like sheep, exercise no judgment of their own and obey any commands given by hijackers. 9/11 should have sufficiently demonstrated the fundamental flaw with that approach - that it is <i>brittle</i>. It was perhaps worth <i>trying</i> back then, but it didn&#x27;t work and we should try something else instead.<p>There are many busses in NYC where the bus driver is in a bulletproof compartment; he doesn&#x27;t have to come out until/unless it&#x27;s safe. One cannot reasonably expect to hijack such a bus. Planes can be similarly safe against hijacking so long as airlines take cockpit security seriously. Make sure the door is strong and secure, make sure the pilots can see OUT of it well when they need to - this might involve a bulletproof glass window - and make sure there are clear protocols such that nothing going on in the main cabin can <i>force</i> the pilots to come out. Let the pilots be armed as well if they so desire. Beyond that, we might want to encourage passengers NOT to be sheep, but it would probably suffice to merely let them exercise common sense. (The would-be shoe bomber and underwear bomber were ignominiously foiled by fellow passengers.) &quot;Taking control&quot; of a huge room full of hundreds of people is not an inherently easy thing to do and it&#x27;s not clear it could ever happen again in a similar situation now that the risk is known. Given that ordinary technology and protocols and social institutions make controlling the cabin unlikely and controlling the cockpit nearly impossible even WITH the use of weapons, why bother searching for them?<p>There is a weird feedback loop in operation: we are unusually afraid of plane hijackings, so plane hijackings are an unusually good way to make people afraid. But hijacking is already nearly impossible, so we just need to <i>stop being afraid of it</i>. The solution to terrorism is to stop being terrorized. Modern security leaves people defenseless as it sends the message that they SHOULD be afraid; getting rid of security would send the message that the threat isn&#x27;t so bad that we need to be paranoid about it. Paradoxically, this would actually make planes a less attractive target for terrorists.<p>There is no baby in there; it&#x27;s ALL bathwater.

8225816,comment,8223585,8223585,3,0,theoutlander,,,"Great job on taking the time to do a writeup! Last year, I designed a similar algorithm from scratch one weekend to implement some complex spatio-temporal visualizations. I was ecstatic because it was faster than Quadtrees. I thought that I had invented something new. Later, I read somewhere that a mathematician had invented that algorithm close to 200 years ago! Not only did that burst my bubble, but it also made me feel stupid for not having found it. Anyway, using this approach I was able to implement a Linear Quadtree in Javascript using Typed arrays that could accommodate 1 Arc Second resolution all the way up to 60 Arc Minutes if you wanted to. It is extremely performant and I ended up using it to do some really neat animated heatmaps. I went through the invention process myself only to realize someone had thought of that problem ~200 years ago. No idea why that person did it though. I suppose mathematicians did that back in the days....wonder what the application was!<p>This process is known as Z-Order Curve (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-order_(curve)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-order_(curve)</a>). You can quickly get to an index in memory or a cell/location on the map using Morton-Encoding. It is also known as a Linear Quadtree.<p>Foundations of Multidimensional and Metric Data Structures is a great resource!

If combined with transit infrastructure improvements, I suspect it would be possible to keep a very nice walkable livable city with dramatically increased housing stock.

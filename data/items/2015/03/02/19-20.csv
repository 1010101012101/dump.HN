I remember the best teaching lecturer during my undergrad being fired for his low research output.<p>For the most part, undergraduates don&#x27;t need to be taught by great researchers. I mean, it&#x27;s inspiring, but we all know leading figures get PHD students to put together their course anyway.<p>The department needed a high average researcher quality to increase the chance of future funding. That would indicate they believe research subsidises teaching.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how this works, as UK students pay about £24 per hour of lecture time, and there are probably 100 of them in the room. Research must be really profitable if it can make more than £2400 an hour.<p>An interesting article on the American side: <a href=""http://centerforcollegeaffordability.org/research/studies/who-subsidizes-whom/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://centerforcollegeaffordability.org/research/studies/wh...</a>",1425326389

And there is still a ton of money buying 30 yr bonds that only pay ~2.5% interest.<p>The Fed keeps rates low because its in their best interest; they are owners, they want inflation to be as low as possible. As long as they can sell enough debt at current rate they would never raise interest rates. The same reason a company who could sell plenty of debt at 5% wouldn&#x27;t raise their rate to 7%.",1425326364

9133899,comment,9132410,9132410,0,0,AprilArcus,,,"I agree with and appreciate nearly all of these suggestions. Just a few well-intentioned quibbles:<p>> Arrays MUST be created using the Array syntax literal.<p>This does enhance readability when vending an empty array, but when you know how large an array will need to be in advance, new Array(someLength) is an important pattern. Consider this naïve implementation of Clojure&#x27;s &quot;reductions&quot; or Haskell&#x27;s &quot;scanl&quot;:<p><pre><code>  let reductions = (callback, initial, array) =>\n    array.reduce( (memo, element) => {\n      memo.push( callback(memo[memo.length - 1], element) );\n      return memo;\n    }, [initial]);\n</code></pre>\nThis will call push() array.length times. If the backing store for Array is a typical vector implementation that reallocates every time its length exceeds a power of 2, this means incurring log₂(array.length) reallocations, and suffering the concomitant heap fragmentation. However, if we pre-allocate an array of the appropriate size once before entering the loop,<p><pre><code>  let reductions = (callback, initial, array) => {\n    let result = new Array(array.length + 1);\n    result[0] = initial;\n    array.forEach( (element, index) =>\n      result[index + 1] = callback(result[index], element)\n    );\n    return result;\n  };\n</code></pre>\nwe can avoid creating unnecessary work for the VM.<p>> Regular (named and hoisted) function declarations SHOULD be used instead of anonymous functions by default.<p>I think this is really bad advice. Hoisting makes imperative code harder to reason about; any time that it would actually make a difference, the un-hoisted behavior is the one I would want. The verbosity of let myFunction = function(x,y) {}; over myFunction(x,y) {} is definitely unsightly, but it&#x27;s worth my peace of mind.<p>> undefined MUST NOT be used, void 0 MUST be used instead. [...] Pure convention. Also void 0 looks more l33t.<p>undefined should be preferred on grounds of readability. If ES3 compatibility is really important, you can configure babel to emit void 0 in place of undefined with the spec.undefinedToVoid optional transformer.",1425325828

We paid off mortgage in 2011 and it was the best decision we made. After paying off mortgage, we redirected the mortgage payments to other investments while we were working. We lost jobs in late 2013.

E.g. you are supposed to redirect after a POST request so that users can&#x27;t double submit a form, but if you&#x27;re hosting your frontend on a CDN then this isn&#x27;t possible because the CORS spec prevents browsers from honoring redirect responses except for after GET and HEAD requests.<p>Incidentally, you are supposed to be allowed to redirect in response to GET requests, but if you use JWT auth then you can&#x27;t even do this because the non-standard header forces a preflight request, and CORS requests with preflight aren&#x27;t allowed to redirect at all.<p>I don&#x27;t even understand how it&#x27;s supposedly secure to pass back JSON with a URL for your promise to trigger a redirect, but it&#x27;s insecure to pass your browser a 3XX response to do the same thing automatically.",1425325172

But it seems that partly what makes YC successful is also what makes BH successful.<p>BH also has an extra 50 years on YC, so of course the models don&#x27;t match up. And I&#x27;m not Sam, so I can&#x27;t speak to whether not YC&#x27;s ownership or investment models will change over the next 50 years (and yes, I think there&#x27;s a good chance YC will be around in 50 years). YC is focused on testing and validating its thesis across other industries, but the thesis started in one area. Very much the same with BH.<p>In other words, if BH&#x27;s only value is that they can successfully help grow a candy company, an insurance company, and a train shipping company, and YC is able to help grow a fusion company, a hotel industry company, and a home cleaning company, then they are both doing something right. It seems they are both heavily driven by focused principles.<p>Another great point is that YC and BH don&#x27;t have traditional competition.

Once you have the data, you can obviously give the individual user the best alternative route if there is delay on the desired one. You can also use this proactively, similar to what &quot;Google Now&quot; does, to alert commuters in the morning how much longer their trip might take. You could even offer functionality to automatically adjust the phone&#x27;s alarm clock.<p>But you can take this even further than individual users and dynamically re-route passenger flows if enough of them are using the service. Say there is an interruption on a main commuter route, but several alternatives exist. Most people are now likely to choose the second best route. Since that route is unlikely to be able to handle the additional passengers, it will probably be jammed very quickly. However, using the RT passenger and situation data, it would be possible to find the globally optimal solution for load balancing the passenger flow. You can then provide the passengers via smartphone with individualised information regarding which route to take to implement this routing.<p>I think this has a lot of potential for taking public transport to the next level by utilising existing capacities to the fullest extent and providing benefits to all passengers.",1425323799

But it can still work; it&#x27;s not a disastrous error.<p>There really are plenty of unneeded c-sections out there -- especially as the active doctor nears the end of his/her shift (&quot;well, let&#x27;s wrap this up!&quot;).  And a c-section is major abdominal surgery, so it poses a risk of complications that&#x27;s non-negligible... but it&#x27;s a quick, well-known procedure, so it&#x27;s easier to deal with (for the doctors) than a prolonged labor that may require them to come running unexpectedly.  And the surgery risk isn&#x27;t disastrous, of course; I&#x27;m not sure the overall risk is really different from a vaginal birth.  But a vaginal birth can go wrong in a wider <i>variety</i> of ways, so the doctors will generally prefer birth by surgery.<p>Breast-feeding vs. formula feeding has a lot of research around it as well; but it&#x27;s still only partially understood.  Breast milk contains the mother&#x27;s antibodies, bacteria in it determine the baby&#x27;s gut flora for the rest of its life, it changes based on various factors in the mother&#x27;s life, it makes a high level of skin contact with the mother automatic (and I believe there&#x27;s been research showing that&#x27;s important; something about cortisol levels, and brain development?) -- things no formula can provide.  To make the hospital birth seem still worse: having a c-section makes it much harder to avoid using formula (since the milk doesn&#x27;t start easily without the birth trigger).  BUT what kind of risk is actually involved, in using formula?<p>Again, if you could put numbers on this stuff, I suspect the <i>real</i> differences in the child&#x27;s life are quite small, and very much overwhelmed as influences by life experience.  Even if someone has a few more illnesses as a child... maybe this will mean they stay home with their grandmother more often, and form a powerful bond that dramatically affects their entire life.<p>The problem is that regular people see healthcare decisions like these as binary.  Right decision vs. wrong decision.  They don&#x27;t really understand levels of risk, and the doctor doesn&#x27;t talk in those terms either.  Just &quot;do this&quot;.  Or sometimes a slightly passive-aggressive &quot;well, it&#x27;s up to you&quot;.<p>In those terms, the new parent-to-be sees 5-6 things in a row where the advice of the well-paid professional is the <i>wrong thing</i>, according to pretty reasonable logic.<p>It&#x27;s not that hard to then convince them that maybe vaccines are also not a good thing, because the ground has been laid already.  And sadly, there&#x27;s lots & lots written by all kinds of people trying to convince you that vaccines are dangerous.<p>It kind of freaks me out, honestly, but I do see how people get there.  It just takes this existing distrust (partly merited), a misunderstanding of basic statistics, and a handful of examples of autistic kids who started showing symptoms somewhere around the time of the vaccinations (&#x27;cause yeah, these things happen around the same time of life...).",1425323650

This large random number is then used as a seed to encrypt the drive.  So it&#x27;s not anything like just extracting the disk image then brute force attempting the 10000 valid codes from 0000-9999.<p>edit: here is a better explanation<p><pre><code>   Apple was a front runner in implementing some sort of encryption long before \n   others even thought about it. Apple uses a 256-bit device-unique secret key \n   (UID) stored in the phone’s hardware, where it’s hard to extract from. Apple \n   says this UID is unique to the device and it doesn’t store these values. It \n   also says that no software or hardware can read this key. This UID is mixed \n   with the passcode to generate a new key (passcode key) to secure data on the \n   device. Unlike Android, this UID key can’t be extracted from the device, so \n   all the brute forcing attempts have to be done on the device itself. [1]\n</code></pre>\nSo I would guess it&#x27;s reasonably secure to non-governmental adversaries.

When Sony was hacked, I saw similar comments about how it serves them right for having bad security.  Some people even go as far as to praise the hacker and think they shouldn’t be held accountable for their crime.  After all, if Uber didn’t want this, they wouldn’t have made themselves so vulnerable to penetration.<p>While I agree companies like Uber and Sony need to invest more time and energy into security, real people are hurt when these types of things happen.  It isn’t the executive-level “fat cats” who are hurt the most. It is normal, everyday people.  They did not ask for their personal information to be stolen.  Their only crime was working for a company with poor information security.<p>Furthermore, the fact Uber issued a subpoena for information from Github does not make Uber the bad guy for requesting the information and Github the good guy for withholding the information.   A crime was committed and this is part of the investigation.   The information requested by Uber is not unreasonable.  They are basically requesting log files for that specific Gist.<p>Channeling my inner Matthew McConaughey from A Time to Kill, imagine this happening to an organization that is more likeable than Uber or Sony (shouldn’t be that hard).  What if this happened to an organization responsible for helping rape victims and this person leaked the private information of rape victims to the Internet?  Would people be so willing to support the criminal? Would people be so eager to praise Github for not cooperating?<p>Just because Uber is a horrible, unethical company does not mean it isn’t protected under the law.

Words themselves, rhythms, sentence structures -- all the figures of rhetoric that invisibly lead a reader into the story.

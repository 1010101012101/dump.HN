That&#x27;s what&#x27;s been happening. The process hasn&#x27;t completed yet, but it will, give it time. It takes time because standards bodies move slowly etc. etc.<p>At that point, who prefers Flash to the standard? Nobody. Not developers, not users, not even Adobe -- who is only in it to sell software, which they can sell just as well if the output is HTML as if the output is SWF. It even benefits them to kill Flash (the plugin), because then they don&#x27;t have to maintain it anymore. Everyone would be happy to have Mozilla do that part instead.<p>So you say, fine, open source Flash, make that the standard everyone is converging on so we don&#x27;t have to wait. Ignore for a moment the probable licensing issues Adobe would have in doing that if they&#x27;ve licensed anything from anyone for use in Flash. Ignore the wailing you would hear from Hollywood if the &quot;DRM&quot;/obfuscation they think they get from Flash were to be made transparent by releasing the source code. Who actually <i>wants</i> the plugin?<p>The features that Flash provides would work better if they were properly integrated into the browser. But doing that requires you to rewrite the code as part of the browser instead of a plugin -- which you want to do anyway because as we all know the Flash plugin is a dungeon of sorrow and despair. But if you have to rewrite it in any event then what good is having it? You just throw it away and start over as you would anyway.<p>So Flash is dead. All that releasing the code would get you is to extend the period of time that we spend lugging around its corpse in the passenger&#x27;s seat pretending it might wake up again. If you really want to do something productive, find a feature in Flash that isn&#x27;t in HTML and submit a patch implementing it to Mozilla and Chromium. Shipping code wins -- implement it and people will use it, and implement it the same in two major browsers and the other will follow and standardize it. The sooner that happens the sooner Flash can disappear and make everyone the happier for it.",1380074094
6442191,comment,6441219,6441731,9,0,king_jester,,,">  Myst&#x27;s legacy is that if something is pretty, people will buy it, play it, talk about it until the newest pretty thing comes out, then forget about it.<p>One of the things that I enjoy most about Myst is its atmosphere, even today when its graphics are considerably outdated. As an adventure type game, interacting with the game and the story it tells is a huge part of keeping you interested in playing the game, so I don&#x27;t really buy that this was just some &quot;ooo shiny&quot; fad game.<p>> This article is completely delusional. Myst was not this huge, influential masterpiece the way it paints. The Sopranos changed television. Myst did not change video games. It was talked about like the Sopranos, but only for a year after it came out. And it didn&#x27;t have a lasting impact on the games industry. It looked good for the time, then quickly became outdated and is clearly a relic of its time, like wide, ill-fitting jackets and pleated pants. The gameplay offered nothing new - better adventure games (like those offered by LucasArts and Sierra) were doing more for longer. But its influence was an illusion. Graphics have always been getting better and striving for more photorealism. Myst didn&#x27;t have any affect on that mindset, it just had decent graphics for when it came out.<p>Myst has most certainly influential to a good degree. This game has been ported A LOT and is still talked about. It definitely has some influence on modern game designers (The Witness and Gone Home come to mind). It also spawned 4 official sequels over 14 years (Myst 5 came out in 2005). That the gameplay is not wholly original or that Myst isn&#x27;t the absolute genre-defining title for adventure games doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t influential.<p>> Myst&#x27;s legacy is that if you make something pretty enough, the buzz it generates will lead to huge sales until people realize it&#x27;s an illusion. Which is why these guys weren&#x27;t able to do anything after Myst.<p>Plenty of game devs and designers do not release many games or only have 1 or 2 hits, but that doesn&#x27;t diminish anything about those games.<p>> Meanwhile, Grand Theft Auto, Half Life, Assassin&#x27;s Creed, and Zelda and Mario, these games that Myst apparently enabled, continue to move people and make huge amounts of money.<p>Mario and Zelda were things before Myst and all of those games series have had their own transformations and changes over sequels. But we know the adventure games, including first person types, are not dead and are having a bit of a resurgence right now, esp. in the indie scene, so I wouldn&#x27;t write Myst off so easily.",1380074069

High level, in order to maintain a broadcast licence in Canada, you need to have a certain percentage of your content be defined as &quot;Canadian&quot;. The way you get a piece of content certified as Canadian is via point system - Canadian director, +1 point, Canadian lead actor, +1 point, etc... more info here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_content"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_content</a><p>One really odd thing about Canada is we don&#x27;t &quot;naturally&quot; produce enough content for broadcasters to meet their Canadian content requirements (let alone content people actually want to consume), therefore there are HUGE subsidies in place for the production of Canadian content - like billions of dollars a year huge. These subsidies enable broadcasters to pick up Canadian shows cheaply in order to meet their quotas. Most Canadians don&#x27;t realize how much money is given to media creators because the money is distributed in many different forms from different institutions, at both the provincial and federal level, i.e. those which invest in media (<a href=""http://telefilm.ca/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://telefilm.ca/</a>) distribute tax credits (i.e. <a href=""http://www.omdc.on.ca/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.omdc.on.ca/</a> ), and so fourth. 
This is ignoring the CBC by the way, the government financed broadcast organization.<p>The subsidies haven&#x27;t followed changes in Canadian media consumption patterns though, meaning we over-subsidize mediums which are consumed less and under-subsidize those that are consumed more. It will be interesting to see if / how things change moving forward.",1380073942

6442175,comment,6441221,6441663,5,0,nostrademons,,,"Something I&#x27;d like to see: an API-compatible reimplementation of Django in C++, which would function as both a host for existing Django apps and a C++ web framework that you could gradually rewrite the hot spots of your webapp into.<p>This would basically be a high-performance HTTP server coupled with an embedded Python interpreter.  Instead of running Django in Python, it would take your app&#x27;s settings.py and url.py and compile the URLs you have into a DFA, using a high-performance regexp implementation like re2.  When a pattern matches, you could <i>either</i> register your handlers in Python or in C++.  Python handlers would work like Django normally does: they invoke a Python function, pass in request/response objects (constructed quickly via a C++ native HTTP parser), and write the response back to the socket.  C++ handlers would invoke a C++ class to do the processing, which would use native C++ DB bindings or RPC stubs. C++ code should be able to call into the Python code via the normal interpreter mechanisms, so you can share utility functions between them.  (Vice versa as well, though writing Python bindings for C++ utilities might be a bit more of a chore.)<p>The templating language could also be redone to parse the templates on server reload, generate bytecode, and then read directly from C++ data structures or Python wrappers around those.  Then rendering the template becomes a very quick linear pass over the bytecode, either outputting to a buffer or directly doing zero-copy vectored IO to the socket.<p>The cool thing about this (other than the extra speed from using good algorithms and writing the framework in a fast language) is that you could incrementally transition from a productivity-focused startup webapp to a performance-focused high-growth webapp.  You don&#x27;t need to write <i>everything</i> in C++; only the most frequently trafficked dynamic pages.  Oftentimes webapps have very sharp hotspots, eg. I&#x27;m guessing that the front page of HN gets many times more pageviews than /new, /leaders, or /reply.  If they&#x27;re static you can cache them, but oftentimes the heavily-trafficked pages are heavily trafficked because they change frequently.<p>The other cool thing is that it preserves a built-in framework for prototyping and experimentation that can re-use functionality you&#x27;ve built for the production site.  Usually the experimentation process doesn&#x27;t stop when a company grows up: it&#x27;s really important to provide an escape hatch for folks to try new ideas without having to rewrite everything you&#x27;ve built over time.",1380073788

All I have to say is &quot;allaire homesite&quot;, most CFdevs should remember.<p>Nevertheless I got involved a handful of huge flex applications. This was back when it was Apollo, so 07/08. Firefox was gaining traction but not much, Jquery didn&#x27;t really exist and google was for searching, not web browsing.<p>These apps looked beautiful, every pixel was accounted for, they were responsive(ish) and, the best part, when they were done they were DONE (mostly). No more trying to support IE5.5 or IE6. Flex was something you could sell to an enterprise shop.<p>Then native technologies finally caught up. The IPhone, perhaps rightly so, gave a huge middle finger to Adobe. Then JQuery, then Bootstrap comes into the picture and... amazingly... the shit actually works. Seriously, this is not expected behavior when dealing with html/css/js libraries.<p>Flex was really just a means to an end. For devs like me it meant I didn&#x27;t have to code another $#@! table layout or drop-down-select or menu-navigation or accordion.<p>On one hand I feel the industry caught up to Flex and the better player (native support) won. I feel that I shouldn&#x27;t personally blame Adobe on this one.

The page/site distinction is orthogonal to the authorized/unauthorized distinction. It&#x27;s not clear to me why, in your story, it was OK to ask for ID 334, but it if it were, that doesn&#x27;t automatically make it OK to grab 335.<p>The library is itself an analogy and it&#x27;s a bit broken here, because of course at a library the ISBNs and the books they correspond to <i>aren&#x27;t</i> meant to be private, unlike the ATT/Weev case. So let&#x27;s imagine that your iPad automatically looked up your email address using its ICC ID because that was why they built it (I don&#x27;t actually know if that&#x27;s the case or not). It doesn&#x27;t follow that you have permission to look up everyone else&#x27;s. That&#x27;s where I was going with the doors analogy. I hope that clears that up.<p>> There is explicit permission to contact the web server.<p>I deleted my counter to this because I think it&#x27;s an irrelevant semantics issue. Let&#x27;s let that one go.<p>> In the former case, I may be doing something unexpected, but I am not exceeding the authority given to me.<p>We keep stumbling on this concept of authority, and this thing about design. The design part I don&#x27;t get. Didn&#x27;t the library software&#x27;s author design the system so that it took query parameters and directly formed SQL strings out of them? So isn&#x27;t it working exactly as designed? Of course not, because the designer never intended it to be used that way [1]. So their <i>intention</i> is exactly what matters, and the same applies to trying incremental ICC IDs--clearly not the intent of the service. That&#x27;s why this design/expectation dichotomy isn&#x27;t there, or at least isn&#x27;t relevant (it&#x27;s also why I was distinguishing the &quot;purpose of the software&quot; from the &quot;design of the code&quot; earlier).<p>As for authority, you continue to see it as something the webserver can provide by virtue of its technical characteristics, and I--and the law--simply don&#x27;t. Authorization in the technical sense is a technological codification of an authorization policy, which may be implicit. If that policy is obvious (which I think it is here), then it&#x27;s that policy that matters, not its technical enforcement. I fear we&#x27;re retreading ground here, though, and this may just boil down to having different axioms.<p>[1] You could say that there are layers to design and that the flaw in the designs here (&quot;don&#x27;t do any access control&quot; vs &quot;don&#x27;t sanitize strings&quot;) are at grossly different granularities. That&#x27;s true, but I&#x27;m not sure how you plan to formalize the appropriate level of generality that makes such a design flaw equivalent to permission to entry as opposed to simply not working as designed. I don&#x27;t think you can without resorting to the designer&#x27;s intent.",1380071809

While a larger capacity (c) would increase pre-image resistance, it wouldn&#x27;t help generic collision resistance (which would always be limited by the output size).  There are certainly contexts where a pre-image attack would be more damaging than a collision, but collisions can be a problem in other situations.  Asking the user to figure out which security level applies to their application seems like a source of potential issues.  Giving them a generic security level parameter to work with might make things easier.<p>On top of that, Keccak&#x27;s software performance is nothing to write home about and SHA-256 and SHA-512 look a lot safer now than they did when the SHA3 competition was started.  The reasonably large performance boost the capacity changes could bring about might help SHA-3&#x27;s case a bit for software developers who have barely started moving away from SHA-1 (if they&#x27;re not still hanging on to MD5).<p>While 512 vs 256 bits of pre-image security for SHA-3-512 (which the author seems to think is an unacceptable security downgrade) is interesting to discuss in an academic sense, it seems ludicrous to suggest the change would actually benefit someone trying to break SHA-3.

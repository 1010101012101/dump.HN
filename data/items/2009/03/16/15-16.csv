I've also read a lot about young writers and there are very few specifically for this reason, not necessarily for a lack of creativity but for the inability to produce something believable.<p>How can a 15 year old write believably about relationships, or going to a bar or club, or any of these things. Experience can easily be transposed from one place to another; aka, you don't have to get kicked in the gut to know it's going to hurt a lot, just like you don't need to win the PGA tour to write how great it would feel to win it. However, if you've never won anything or felt any sense of achievement, it has to be exceptionally hard to write convincingly about someone winning.<p>I think this is why most writers begin appearing in their 20's (I believe it depends on region, I've seen more early-20's writers from the UK, where you graduate high-school at 16, than from the US, where you graduate high-school at 18) when they've had many formative experiences and they start experiencing the real world. When they start to see hardship and all the rest that comes with adulthood.",1237216222

Is this a fund in the traditional angel/vc model, or do they just now own a chunk of Y Combinator? And if so, do they therefore own a small chunk of past YC companies still in the portfolio?<p>If so, it would seem my startup is now partially owned by some of the many angels and VCs who turned us down, which will really kill some of my revenge fantasies :)",1237216210

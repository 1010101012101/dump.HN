10681042,comment,10680589,10680781,0,0,npunt,,,"Very good question, I don&#x27;t know!<p>I&#x27;m unfamiliar with the structures of working groups but I imagine it&#x27;d have to be pretty heavily social sciences weighted (ethnography, sociology/psychology, media studies, education, etc). Personally, I&#x27;d like to see a mix of rapid prototyping, science fiction (engaging in hypotheticals on systems and cultural impact), and solid research. Evaluation is going to be challenging due to the uniqueness of experiences in social systems (e.g. in social networks every feed is different, so less unified starting point). I think surfacing the problems-behind-the-problem like understanding / capturing the different starting points of each readers knowledge would play prominently in any truly transformative solution.<p>On the business end, right now I can&#x27;t imagine there&#x27;s much of a business vehicle for driving this forward, as the market would favor general solutions applied to pre-existing properties (e.g. bolt-ons like Disqus) or incremental changes (e.g. better mod tools on reddit or something), whereas my strong suspicion is that deeper innovations probably need to be developed alongside wholly new online properties - you know, the medium is the message and all that. Evaluating success would be difficult given the need to create and verify new metrics of success, and I&#x27;m not sure many startups have the patience, knowhow, or desire to dig deep into research required for this.<p>I guess its worth mentioning I started an online news company so I&#x27;ve had more than a passing chance to think about / be frustrated with this problem space. In the challenging environment of growing a journalism startup (not exactly a high $$ biz), I wasn&#x27;t able to sink my teeth enough into creating new designs for media publishing and community tools, and was so unsatisfied with the present offerings that we just avoided going down the discussion board route altogether. It remains my belief that a &#x27;news&#x27; is a sense-making and ultimately educational problem being solved (poorly) by publishing systems, and the field of &#x27;journalism&#x27; lacks imagination in what ways they can create said news, assuming everything just becomes an article written by a journalist because thats how newspapers did it.",1449294842

Most students/people can&#x27;t break down a problem into small enough steps for the computer to do them.<p>Are you familiar with the concept of &quot;chunking&quot; in memory research? Well, computers don&#x27;t chunk but humans do. Humans tend to think about their algorithms in terms of the chunks they already know, but for computers sometimes each chunk has to be broken down into much smaller sub-steps.<p>And that&#x27;s non-intuitive and hard. When explaining stuff to a human you get immediate non-verbal or sometimes verbal feedback if they don&#x27;t understand the chunks, but computers just give a syntax error.<p>SECONDLY. Students have trouble making an accurate mental model of what the computer is doing at each step, so they can&#x27;t trace through the code, much less create new code.<p>Those are the two biggies, in my experience.",1449294835

These were people who were not only using SR, but active in the community as well.

Certain types of decisions get made by a very small group of people who somehow acquire a tone-deafness when it comes to outside criticism. Then, when the decisions become public, the negative reaction is not only not understood, sometimes it&#x27;s not believed, or not taken seriously, and simply serves to retrench the decision makers in their choice and they go radio silent. Then after a while, they may or may not reevaluate that without any form of communication as to what&#x27;s going on inside. Then, a year or two later, it&#x27;ll happen again.<p>I am NOT insulting people, there&#x27;s no malice in that process, no lack of intelligence, no evil intents. I use the phrase &quot;tone deafness&quot; purposefully because I feel it conveys the idea that these bad decisions come simply from some acquired inability to perceive and understand.

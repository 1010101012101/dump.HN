Do they have a stronger foothold in the market with expected longevity to out-survive an office tower, apartment complex or gas pipeline? Is it likely to attract better talent than Valley&#x27;s established public companies (GOOG, AAPL, FB) or Valley&#x27;s hyper-growth startups with IPO potential (Uber), and that better talent will out-compete the rivals on products, execution and market share (and, as corollary, fall under &quot;dividend growth&quot; umbrella, in theory allowing me to buy larger yields at substantial discount)?<p>Dropbox would have to compensate investors for (a) lack of liquidity and (b) for being in technology software market, known to be particularly unforgiving with its &quot;winner takes all&quot; mentality. Its peers would be highly risky single purpose private REITs (think casinos and fracking companies in North Dakota).<p>To accommodate that compensation the yields would likely have to be in the double-digits range, so let&#x27;s say with profits of $20 mln of which $10 mln is allocated to dividends the expected valuation would be in the range of $60-100 mil (10-15% expected yield which seems reasonable in this rate environment with the type of risk described).",1454565294

I especially admire their community tutorials, which hosts tons of great content and I&#x27;m sure has been very valuable marketing for their products. With that said, I think trying to build a real startup on DO would be a big mistake. They simply don&#x27;t offer the suite of products that the bigger cloud offerings do, and as clouds become more sophisticated, companies using them will have huge competitive advantages. From my perspective, tools like PaaS,  Lambda, managed databases, big data/analytic tools etc are getting increasingly sophisticated. Using them now is a bit like a late 90s company using Python to code circles around companies sticking familiar, stable C++, where in this analogy C+ +is the equivalent to DO&#x27;s basic VPS offerings that you use to cobble together what you need (stable and familiar, but ultimately less powerful and requires much more developer time to use effectively).",1454565059

He wanted the whole company to move as fast as its Android and Chrome divisions.<p>> One impetus for this decision was a memo from a longtime Googler named Urs Hölzle. It reminded everyone that social networks, and Facebook in particular, had become a dominant force on the Internet. It said that Google was nearly blind to all the knowledge stored on Facebook. Hölzle pleaded with his colleagues to focus on social media, or else the company could be swept away in an oncoming wave.<p>> Page took the memo to heart, and put Vic Gundotra in charge of developing a social network for Google. The project was code-named Emerald Sea, after a Japanese painting in which a boat is about to be wiped out by a huge wave. Gundotra’s team built a prototype in a hundred days.<p>> The speed impressed Page. He realized that one thing Android, Chrome, and the Emerald Sea project had in common was that each had a single person in charge. He wondered if it was time to put one person in charge of search.<p>> Gundotra, suddenly vested with influence thanks to the Emerald Sea project, made it known that he did not like working with Mayer.

You can fund 1,000 companies for 30k and if one becomes Uber [3] and all the others fail your 7% stake might be worth as much as 145x your initial investment. 30 million is only a half dozen Yahoo parties, many countries have wasted multiples of that on fancy &quot;entrepreneurship encouraging&quot; offices.<p>When Georges Doriot financed DEC in 1957 [1], he got 70% for his $70,000 ($600,000 in 2016 [2]). These were proven scientists with a track record of successful research. It was considered a landmark deal because it was not blue chip, and the founders were not connected. How many smart people languished in corporate or government labs instead of starting another DEC or Microsoft? What was the opportunity cost of the lack of capital availability?<p>Then you have YC v1.0, which invested $20k for 7%... which we easily forget today was a non-controlling stake, and thus groundbreaking (or at least trend-setting). YC set the terms for the rest of the world to follow (slowly - I still meet, here in Singapore, angels who want complete control from the seed round onwards). Founders could actually still control their company after taking outside money!<p>Of course there were the ancillary benefits of the network and so on, but to me the really groundbreaking idea was also that significant expansion of the number of companies that could get funded. Working class scholar at MIT whose daddy doesn&#x27;t know Tim Draper? No worries, you just need to fill in the form, YC will get in touch.<p>Competition, and inflation (both general inflation, and of opportunity cost from the two tech booms) drove that up to $120k, still for 7% - which even today is a very good deal for a pre-product company, and allowed thousands of founders to have access to a much better deal than they would otherwise.<p>Who is left out at this point? Pre-product companies that need money to get the MVP done, and foreign companies where seed investment is done on much worse terms than in the US for a variety of reasons that are regularly discussed here. They don&#x27;t need much; as has been amply written about you can get ramen profitable on 20-50k with many ideas, and this is literally years of living costs in much of the world. But that capital is just not available because wealth is concentrated in (often foreign) land, bonds and blue chip companies. 1.5% is laughably small, doubly so when you consider this is basically free money unless you become a fairly decent success.<p>YC is not the only company who understands this. The very idea of 500 Startups - &quot;if you have an angel, you&#x27;re eligible&quot; - is about numbers over any attempt at reading the future.<p>I can&#x27;t wait to see how it works out. And how people will copy it. And I love the philosophy of it: YC is expressly saying that no, not all talent is concentrated at &quot;Stanford&quot; - that there are many variables in life (such as geographical location or social background) that will impede a large number of talented people from having access to the resources necessary to capitalise on that talent.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation#Origins"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation#...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.dollartimes.com/inflation/inflation.php?amount=70000&year=1957"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dollartimes.com/inflation/inflation.php?amount=70...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-03/uber-raises-funding-at-62-5-valuation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-03/uber-raise...</a>",1454563577

Obviously because storage will be infinite and free in the future. Google Drive for education is already completely free.<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/edu/products/productivity-tools/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/edu/products/productivity-tools/</a><p>What that means is that Dropbox is shifting from a consumer to an enterprise company. We all know for consumers they&#x27;re way too expensive - 1TB for $100 is way to much free space for the average person.<p>The problem is they&#x27;ve screwed up other things. Google owned Carousel with Google Photos. Mailbox turned out to be an overly expensive acqui-hire. Luckily that doesn&#x27;t affect them that much because they raised a boatload of cash and have lots of customers.<p>Now will Dropbox go away or die? Probably not but they&#x27;ll always be behind Box when it comes to enterprise features.<p>It&#x27;s too bad Box and Dropbox can&#x27;t merge. Box has crap sync and Dropbox lacks a lot of Enterprise features Box has.",1454562388

The big match (Boxing Day Test) coincides nicely with the break week many jobs have between Xmas and New Year. So the fact that you have a bunch of downtime from work combined with it being too damn hot to want to do much else makes vegging out on couch with a beer (or several) and the cricket on the box all that more appealing.<p>I do not know a lot about American football but I recall hearing or reading somewhere that the breaks in play make it a more popular spectator sport.

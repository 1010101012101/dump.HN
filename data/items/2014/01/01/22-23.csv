Different strains contain different ratios of these cannabinoids, and therefore different strains can be more (or less) effective for treating various ailments. Epileptics may require different strains from people suffering from chronic pain, for example.<p>For people who have very specific medical needs, it is <i>very</i> helpful to have access to specific strains so that they can consume less and still reap the benefits.",1388617160

For 273</i>273 example, searches at an established station near the border, at a point marking the confluence of two or more roads that extend from the border, might be functional equivalents of border searches. For another example, a search of the passengers and cargo of an airplane arriving at a St. Louis airport after a nonstop flight from Mexico City would clearly be the functional equivalent of a border search.[4]*<p>There are certainly important differences: the court gives the example of a search of passengers that definitively crossed a border and who are searched where they disembark.<p>That being said, since NY is a major international travel hub, the searches described in that article <i>might</i> qualify as &quot;functionally equivalent&quot; to border searches.

I think Angular is better for a mixed designer/developer team if the dev builds directives with the goal of letting the designer work independently since non-directive Angular is extremely easy to learn.<p>The excitement here is that React is a MUCH better match for Clojurescript. The React model is a one way rendering into a virtual DOM, computing a minimal edit list against the real DOM, and applying it in one batch. The idempotent render lines up with pure functions. The batch nature lines up with the epochal time model of Clojure&#x27;s vars.

Here is my reasoning on that, perhaps we can find out where we&#x27;re disagreeing.<p>I&#x27;m going to claim that an engineering group E has a design D which they put on a process node Pn.  That is a pretty easy claim since pretty much everyone who builds chips does that. :-)<p>I&#x27;m also going to claim that the engineering group is doing everything they can to efficiently use their transistors based on the evidence that efficiency is a key sales metric for chips today.<p>Then I&#x27;m going to claim that for a given design D, on a given process node Pn, you can compute an average cost per transistor for that pairing by considering the number of transistors in the design, the number of instances on a wafer, and the yield of good devices from that wafer, divided by the cost of that wafer.<p>Here is the assertion the article makes (and I agree with)<p>In the next process shrink, the cost of producing a wafer will be so high, there there will be zero change in the cost of chips produced on that process.<p>The engineering teams will do all they can, but the wafer costs will be so much higher that the cost per chip will either not change or go up. It will track signedness if not in magnitude this metric of &#x27;cost per standardized transistor&#x27;. Once that is shown to be true, there will be no more investment in new processes because the economic value will not be there. And I claim that this will mean that from that point on chips will get more expensive over time with or without additional features being added.<p>I can&#x27;t wait for the papers from the 2014 ISSCC which will tell me if I&#x27;m crazy or not :-)",1388615646

Currently the large amount of Danish-German cross-border trade effectively ignores currency exchange risk, because they assume the EUR-DKK peg as formalized through ERM is solid enough that it won&#x27;t change in the forseeable future. So it&#x27;s &quot;safe&quot; to have liabilities in DKK and revenue in EUR or vice-versa without taking any particular measures to hedge your risk.

Effectively each TLD registry (and each of your registrars), along with their regulatory environment, would lose the ability to take down your name without international agreement.<p>For certain niches, such a feature might be a good enough value proposition to ordinary users to convince them to install an extension.<p>Other observation; 36-ary is probably a better encoding for the hash data than hex. DNS isn&#x27;t great with lengthy answers and every byte is worth conserving. But it&#x27;s cool to see something interesting like this in the form of a browser extension.",1388613801

Firefox and Safari display them properly, Chrome doesn&#x27;t, no idea for IE and Opera.<p>UCS-2 is a strict 16-bit encoding (a subset of UTF-16), and it cannot represent all characters.<p>It is the encoding used by JavaScript, which can be problematic when double width characters are used. For example, `&quot;\U0001F419\U0001F41A\U0001F41B\U0001F41C\U0001F41D\U0001F41E\U0001F41F&quot;.length` is 14 even though there are only seven characters, and you could slice that string in the middle of a character.",1388613706

The constituent members of the public do not have (or feel they have) the responsibility or power to effect any sort of macroscopic change to the economy. In that sense, it's not surprising that the public nominates someone to have that power and responsibility.",1224424594

I just find it better for Ubuntu).<p>Once you get running you might consider a switch to Debian, but I've never reached that point.",1224423403

The entire country's natural tendency is to fold back into itself and create pockets of isolation from the outside world - a tendency that has repeated itself for most of their history. It's difficult to draw large scale economic parallels like this without discussing the underlying DNA of the culture supporting the economy in question.<p>The US also has some serious issues, culturally and economically (duh) but I honestly think we're in better shape. There is of course a very real possibility that we're heading into a time of depression that could last years, but the spark of innovation seems alive and well to me. It may be a little misplaced at the moment but the market has its own ways of correcting that.",1224423045

337058,comment,336698,336796,0,0,pg,,,"These are both good points.  I was wondering why the supposed trend was so flat.  The answer is that there are so many other random factors pushing in both directions that there probably is no real trend.<p>It would probably be more reliable to predict the bottom by looking at the ratio of house prices to income.  <i>That</i> shouldn't change too fast.",1224422471

337052,comment,336977,336977,0,0,marvin,,,"As far as the stock market goes, the US has pretty much lost a decade already: both the Dow Jones and S&P500 indexes have bobbed up and down 50% since 1998. (The same goes for the NASDAQ, by the way). This indicates the the markets have priced in the shenanigans already: there has been economic activity, but broadly speaking it hasn't been based on wealth creation. You have produced as many useless things (houses that no one will live in, for instance) as useful things.<p>When you've been living a lie all this time, some pain is bound to follow. For philosophical purposes the difference between recession and debt-fueled boom is small: the only real difference is that people get paid..money which must be paid back later. It is, weirdly enough, an economic zero-sum game. But now it's over, and there's just one way to go on. Maybe there will be a hangover, but these things are temporary.<p>I think it is wrong to draw parallels to Japan. Extrapolating trends and learning from history almost never works with economics. There are too many random (i.e. unknown) variables. For all we know, the US could get its act together in half a year. You've still got the most powerful economy in the world, it has just been focusing on the wrong things for a while. I'm with Buffett.",1224421657

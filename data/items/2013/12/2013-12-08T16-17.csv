It was about them trying to solve, for lack of a better term, an existential crisis. In their irrelevance, their economic irrelevance, they were nonetheless still on the ground occupying this place called Baltimore and they were going to have to endure somehow.</i><p><i>That&#x27;s the great horror show. What are we going to do with all these people that we&#x27;ve managed to marginalise? It was kind of interesting when it was only race, when you could do this on the basis of people&#x27;s racial fears and it was just the black and brown people in American cities who had the higher rates of unemployment and the higher rates of addiction and were marginalised and had the shitty school systems and the lack of opportunity.</i><p>I still think The Wire is the best TV drama yet made, and that  includes Breaking Bad, though I haven&#x27;t watched Sopranos yet. One of the most amazing things about its achievements is how so un-cop-show-like it is...besides cops being of mixed character, they almost never draw their guns on the show...and  yet it&#x27;s still an addictively entertaining show. Simon and his co-writers were so good at creating characters (and drawing from his deep reporting experience) that even as his show has a strong anti-capitalistic tone, the Wire keeps your attention no matter what your political beliefs. Perhaps Simon could eke out one more grand show...beliefs and opinions can be affected  by popular culture as they are by political discourse.",1386521690

6870202,comment,6869897,6870009,6,0,notdrunkatall,,,"The underlying problem here is that the consumer doesn&#x27;t care what the cost of their drugs are; all they do is sign on the dotted line when the doctor recommends something.<p>Insurees are essentially paying a monthly cost for an effectively unlimited pool of medical funds.  As long as the bill is above what their copay costs, they couldn&#x27;t care less how much the drug costs - if anything, they will choose the drug that costs more than what the nearly identical drug costs so they can &#x27;get their money back.&#x27;  As long as the consumer is separated from the consequences of their choices, costs will continue to rise.  Some kind of incentive for people to actually care about the cost of their decisions needs to be engineered into the system.<p>Suppose, perhaps, that instead of mandating that employers provide insurance to full-time employees, the government mandated that employers provide catastrophic insurance and contribute the remainder of the difference between the old system and the new to a kind of Health Savings Account: something that&#x27;s tax-advantaged, and can only be used to pay for healthcare.  Employees would then pay their medical bills directly from this fund, and funds will continuously build if they&#x27;re not used.  The kicker is that this HSA also doubles as a retirement fund, and any funds left over when retirement age is reached can be withdrawn without penalty.  People will see the money as theirs, and will be much more careful about how they spend it, thus putting pressure on doctors and healthcare providers to reduce prices, rather than increasing them.<p>This took me ten minutes to think up.  Give me half an hour, and I&#x27;ll work out most of the kinks.  Give a team of professionals a few weeks, and I&#x27;m sure that we could come up with something that makes infinitely more sense than the ridiculous hodgepodge of special interest legislation and twisted incentives that we have now.",1386521640

So it works really well, but only if you&#x27;re running Chrome, and only if you&#x27;re connecting to Google (or the few other pinned sites hardcoded in Chrome).<p>It doesn&#x27;t scale well because not every website can (or is willing to) hardcode their CA information in browser binaries, the pinned information has to expire at some point (otherwise you can never change your CA), sites are still vulnerable to their <i>own</i> CAs, and it only works in browsers which are willing to maintain this hardcoded list of pins in their client binaries.<p>Trevor Perrin and I developed a dynamic certificate pinning solution called TACK (<a href=\"http://tack.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://tack.io</a>) that is designed to address all of those issues.

You have to stop and think about what there being no such opportunity would mean: housing in these areas is in scarce supply, and letting the market do its thing would incentivize people to convert rooms to full-time hotels at the expense of people who actually live there (since the true market value of a room is much higher than the average rent; in other words, your arbitrage opportunity), which will in turn reduce the supply of apartments available for residents, thus making rent even more expensive than it is right now for the few that will be able to afford it.<p>I agree the regulations are not perfect, but people have to understand it comes from a conscious political decision to protect residents.

It would be painful to adjust to (the base interest rate would be a direct cost rather than an opportunity cost, making banks&#x27; margins thinner) but ultimately work in a similar manner to the existing system.",1386518653

9015276,comment,9014770,9014770,0,0,drawkbox,,,"> Globalism, the casualization of labor (replacing full-time employees with contractors and part-timers) and a zealous fixation on profits above all else have left the American middle class in shambles. That&#x27;s a dangerous thing for a consumer economy.<p>The ruthless MBA short term metric builders and long term value destroyers are still at it. People having money to buy is a good thing, not constant cutting back.<p>Quality work suffers as there is less money to do it, meaning quality products suffer, eventually there is no product and no need for sales/marketing or the CEO because all the grace of current/old innovation dies out. It is very hard to find quality these days except at companies that do somewhat value employees and/or engineering/product over finance (as the product brings the revs, not the revs and cutting).<p>One day we will return to the value of building quality products and value the people that do it as the engine rather than the financial part of the company as the engine.   You can&#x27;t have financial success without happy workers and thus good products being produced. After globalization is more baked in, it won&#x27;t be as easy for companies not valuing quality work. We don&#x27;t want to finish that stage with a depleted consumer base.<p>The minimum wage also should be locked to inflation in some way. Minimum wage triggers raises throughout the market. Eventhough it just rises all boats, it sends ripples through the economy from the bottom up when there are downturns.  In downturns there is too much money locked up in the 1% backdrift as it has to hit rock bottom for investment to start again.  Minimum wage auto increases every 3-6 months would keep a consistent lower end ripple that would eventually make it up to everyone.  If you want a raise, support minimum wage. When you give to the rich they keep it, when you give to the poor they give it right back but at least you have money moving.<p>This is relevant today: <a href=""http://www.theonion.com/articles/company-to-experiment-with-valuing-employees,37947/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theonion.com/articles/company-to-experiment-with-...</a>",1423342676

If enough money is sloshing around willing to invest in any stupid idea, you shouldn’t be too surprised that a lot of stupid ideas get funded. When, for example, Wolfgang Schaeuble, Germany’s finance minister, says: &quot;The reasons for Greece’s problems can be attributable only to Greece and not to actors outside the country, and certainly not in Germany.&quot; As he did during the press conference following his meeting with Yanis Varoufakis, his Greek counterpart, we have to remember that Schaeuble is talking nonsense. It’s logically impossible for excess borrowing to occur unless there is someone sufficiently reckless (or stupid) to provide the financing.&quot;<p>And this is also good:<p>&quot;I am hesitant to introduce what may seem like class warfare, but if you separate those who benefitted the most from European policies before the crisis from those who befitted the least, and are now expected to pay the bulk of the adjustment costs, rather than posit a conflict between Germans and Spaniards, it might be far more accurate to posit a conflict between the business and financial elite on one side (along with EU officials) and workers and middle class savers on the other. This is a conflict among economic groups, in other words, and not a national conflict, although it is increasingly hard to prevent it from becoming a national conflict.&quot;<p>The German government, in collusion with the German business establishment, has wrecked Europe, first through its irresponsible lending, and then, later, through the pressure it put on the ECB to raise rates despite the weak European economy. The German government can try to blame others for the problems in Europe, but the driving force behind all of these problems has been Germany. Germany had a trade deficit at the end of the 1990s, and they wanted to develop a trade surplus, and they did so through a series of irresponsible measures that have done great harm to Europe.",1423342412

Too many hours, and you start losing creativity, your focus becomes too short-term, and you start missing things, making expensive mistakes.<p>Coding when tired is usually net negative, unless it&#x27;s something throwaway for a demo due at short notice, or it&#x27;s something you&#x27;ve done a dozen times before and don&#x27;t need to think about.

Your brain doesn&#x27;t completely shut off work when you go home. Much of the thinking time that you&#x27;d spend at work in 40 hours a week will happen at home when working 30 hours.

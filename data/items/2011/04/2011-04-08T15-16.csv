2424335,comment,2423173,2423173,1,0,orijing,,,"Very interesting idea. However, it made me think that one major flaw of Dropbox will limit its potential as the ""ultimate storage.""<p>Dropbox is very memory intensive, even for my 5 gigs and my 40,000 files in the Box. If you cover my entire hard drive, that's over 100 gigs and millions of files. Each file (and each sub part of a file, sort like like a Merkel Tree) must have its finger print stored in memory. Currently those 40,000 files use about 70 MB, and when syncing, consume an entire CPU. I can't imagine how resource-intensive it would become if I indexed my entire hard drive now.<p>I don't think Dropbox can push order-of-magnitude improvements in resource usage, even if they move away from Python. I'm sure they're already doing very well. I have multiple friends working there, and I have talked to Drew and Arash. All of them are very brilliant people and I doubt that they haven't consumed all the low hanging fruit in performance.<p>Sure, in the future using 20x the memory may be OK. That's just 4.3 doublings, so maybe memory increases may balance it out. But don't forget that the amount of data I have will also increase.<p>So I don't think it's feasible (with the current trajectory of technology) to have Dropbox serve as the ultimate storage medium, unless we develop a different way of syncing files.",1302278280

In utility theory a completely specified preference ordering is the starting point and a utility function can be derived to represent it. These functions are unique only up to a monotone transformation. In the recommender systems we take the quantity as a given and infer the preference order for missing items. If you reassign assign all the 5 stars items to 10 stars, it is perfectly consistent with the ordering, but your inference method may be (will be!) sensitive to such reassignments. To me this suggests you should also be estimating the shape of the best transformation of the rating system. Think of it as an opportunity to reduce bias.

Not knowing any better, I fell right in line.<p>McConnell's basic strategy for delivering an estimate (give a minimum, a maximum, and an ""expected time"") is great for so many reasons, but the reason I like it the best is for its communication value - by giving three numbers, none of them being an ""I can have it done by..."" number, you reinforce the idea that you are delivering an <i>estimate</i> and that the point of delivering that estimate is to help the project manager control the project. If it turns out that the PM is lazy and they really do just want a commitment (""sure, sure, whatever, when will it be done?!""), you can adjust your communication strategy accordingly.",1302277623

2424276,comment,2423146,2423863,11,0,wazoox,,,"> <i>don't build it yourself.</i><p>Of course not. I've built several petabytes worth of storage systems in the past 15 years, OTOH.<p>> <i>Using desktop drives, when 24 are mounted in a single chassis, the vibration from those drives will cause a higher rate of failure. </i><p>Absolutely. However this is not always directly applicable to all desktop drives. In fact I'm going to reveal a secret : physically, desktop SATA drives are exactly the same as professional grade 24/24h operation-guaranteed SATA drives. When they fall off the assembly line, they're tested for reliability and performance. Over a certain threshold, a drive is deemed professional and receive the pro firmware; under the bar, it's a desktop drive.<p>What is the most important difference between the desktop vs pro firmware? The desktop drive is supposed to be used alone. In case of an error, it will retry, retry and retry again endlessly to ecc-correct the error. OTOH, the pro drives ""knows"" it's part of a RAID array; at the slightest fault, it will simply cry ""I'm failed"" and give up. So in case of a transient error, your IOs won't be blocked.<p>There are some other differences depending upon the maker: for instance all Hitachi GST drives carry an accelerometer, but the desktop drive firmware don't know how to use it to compensate for low-frequency vibrations.<p>WD desktop drives have particular settings that make them extremely dangerous to use in RAID arrays.<p>Note that the ""pro/consumer"" threshold can be moved to reach some volume threshold regardless of the actual drive quality. This happened, I've been bitten.<p>Anyway, prefer the pro drives even if there 50% more expensive. It will save you some headaches.<p>> <i>When a single drive in your 24 drive chassis fails, how do you know which one it is?</i><p>First, I suppose the maker (in my case, my team), carefully checked that all drives are properly labeled (so that drive 1 is labeled 1, etc); second, decent RAID controllers can flash a drive LED (Adaptec 5xx5 or 6xx5 series come to mind).<p>> <i>Can you handle a double disk failure without losing data?</i><p>With drives of 1 TB or more, RAID-5 is definitely out and has been so for several years. RAID-6, RAID-6, RAID-6 is the way to go.<p>> <i>These are things that enterprise storage vendors spend months with engineers designing.</i><p>E-xact-ly. BTW I'm an enterprise storage vendor. However I'm really too far from Louisville to be able to ship there and support it. I just mentioned what is possible; don't forget that nowadays, when you're buying an SGI (or many other big names) storage system you're buying Supermicro hardware.",1302277568

Older Germans... plenty of genuinely nice ones, but also sometimes some very entrenched feelings.  Like anywhere, I guess.<p>I had a question for you, if you don't mind.  Norway, Sweden, and Denmark seem to have so thoroughly integrated English as a second language.

While it may sit well with many girls to have an arranged marriage(just look at the huge online matrimonial industry in india), the problem is that parents give into excess peer pressure in many situations and force the girl into a situation. They even sugar coat it, they would tell you you have 1 year if you asked for time, but you must choose. \nThe parent's fears are somewhat elevated by the fact that all prospective grooms are looking at girls in the age bracket of <26 and preferably a age diff of 4 years. And dont even get me started on the caste angle that narrows down the choice to < 2-3% of the population(Is inter community marriage not akin to almost inbreeding? What about the poor gene pool? Not to mention the ick factor).\nI am a guy and looking from the outside who has never been on any side of this system. I can say that though this system has its upsides, like more stable financial prospects etc and perhaps the fore fathers in there infinite wisdom had a method to the madness.

So when looking for a bad guy in a criminal database, for instance, the UI displays just what the audience needs to know to move the plot along -- ""Bad guy just released from prison. Previously arrested for homicide""<p>Even when the UI is complex, it's to advance along a certain plot point -- that the actor is interfacing with or observing some hugely complicated computer system. <i>And even then, whatever you need to know clearly stands out from the background UI art</i><p>Contrast that to the way people actually interface with computers -- all the information that is not necessary, the searching and ferreting out of little bits of data here and there that you then need to assemble, or the waste of time absorbing information that advances nothing at all (lolcats, anyone?)<p>At first, back when they thought a cool UI was simple text, nobody noticed. But now as computers become more immersive, it's clearer and clearer that the idea of a computer advancing along an external story is becoming tougher to dramatize -- because life isn't external to the system like it was before. The good guy doesn't do a bunch of outside, physical stuff and then type a question or two into a simple terminal and then get a simple answer. Instead stories are more about how technology melds with the person. Because of the change to immersive versus interactive relationships with technology, I think these stories are going to be much more difficult for writers and directors to master. For instance (trying to make up some example) little 10-year-old Joey may spend all his free time playing his favorite game, until he meets a killer online and over the period of several months the killer worms his way into the household, setting off a conflict between all of Joey's family. There could be a hell of a lot of drama and tension if hat happened in the real world, but trying to put that in a video format in a 2-hour slot looks really, really tough.",1302275816

In some cases, people pay a small fee to get samples of new products, and then give feedback to the manufacturer. For only five euros, a Barcelona-based outfit, esloúltimo, allows customers to try out five products for two weeks, including a variety of food, household, and tech products. Tryvertising might be used to listen to a potential market and hone the offer, or simply to determine the market’s preference for owning, as opposed to just using, new tools and services.<p>* Zipcar is a near perfect example of a successful Mesh business. It doesn’t make, sell, or repair cars. It shares them. Zipcar is primarily an information business that happens to share cars.<p>* There are seven keys to building trust in the Mesh: 1. Say what you do—manage expectations and revisit them frequently. 2. Use trials. 3. Do what you say. 4. Perpetually delight customers. 5. Embrace social networks and go deep. 6.

A community isn't an end in itself, and as someone recently pointed out, one of the great things about the internet is that it allows people to <i>escape</i> the communities they physically live in. (Think about the gay Midwestern kid in the wheelchair from <i>Milk</i> for a moment.)<p>If words like ""good"" and ""bad"" aren't to your liking, please substitute productive/unproductive, useful/useless, interesting/boring, liberating/stifling, or whatever arbitrary dichotomy you prefer.<p>As for the AVC community, I don't find it particularly interesting. It attracts a lot of fanboys, especially Android fans who consider anyone who buys an iPhone to be sheeple brainwashed by the Steve Jobs reality distortion field. And it attracts a lot of people who are basically promoting themselves or their businesses, and they're trying really hard to exude <i>gravitas</i>. Fuck gravitas.<p>Community is not an end in itself. A community is just as likely to embody dynamics that enforce a soul-crushing conformity as it is likely to be nurturing and supportive. All communities are mixed bags—I think that's inevitable, but don't hold me to it—and the processes that <i>create</i> a community are going to <i>shape</i> the community and the way its members interact, so I would suggest looking at AVC and asking yourself whether you want to create an AVC like community before you decide to consciously harness, deploy, or whatever those processes to create a community.<p>Oh, and the idea that you can replicate anything involving a group of people using a recipe-like approach is ridiculous.

If I have done 2 similar tasks before and they took a month each, then a 2-week estimate has no validity.<p>As far as general code estimation goes, lines of code <i>and</i> complexity taken together form a pretty good metric. If I estimate I have to write 50 lines of high-performance multithreading code, I might say it will take 8 hours. If it's 50 lines of fizzbuzz, estimate drops to 1 hour.<p>But like you say, that's just coding (and unit test). The full task probably requires (1) getting or understanding requirements, (2) at least some cursory thought about design and (2a) having a hallway review with somene if you're not sure. Then when we're done with code, unit test (don't forget to estimate how long it will take to create, debug and run the tests) and Code Review (how many reviewers do you need, how long will it take them to get around to inspecting your code, etc), someone has to estimate (4) how long the test team will take to write test cases and do the system test of the new feature, (5) tech docs has to update the user manuals, (6) sysadmin or the Release Master estimates how long deployment will take.<p>In short, at least in the environment I work in, that 50 lines of code that took eight hours to write, will easily require an entire week before any customer can see it. In my experience, it's often not so much that the developer didn't estimate accurately how long coding would take, it's that the developer never thought about all the ancillary tasks that have to be done (code review, unit test, documenting the design changes, etc), so they were not in the estimate.",1302274900

7521213,comment,7515841,7518835,1,0,smsm42,,,">>> Direct support to a campaign and political advocacy are two different things.<p>No, not really. Giving candidate the money to buy ads and directly buying ads is essentially the same thing from any aspect that may interest us.<p>>>> Your right to free speech ends at the tip of your own tongue.<p>This is obviously false. If that were true, we could not have free press, or free TV, or any electronic or paper media. What we would have is what people in USSR had - they were free to talk about politics in their own kitchen, but once they said anything in public or tried any political action, they were suppressed. This is not freedom, this is a mockery of it. And Founding Fathers clearly never intended to treat freedom of speech that narrow - as a freedom to produce any sounds you like with your throat and tongue. For a functioning democracy, much broader freedoms - freedoms to publish your opinion as widely as you can and engage in discussion with as many people as you can, and exercise any political actions you can (excluding violence and other rights violations, of course) - are absolutely necessary.<p>>>>  if you give control of some money to someone else, they will be the ones responsible for how it gets spent, not you<p>This is false, too. If you give somebody money and say &quot;I want you to hire a killer to murder this guy&quot;, you both would be part of criminal conspiracy. That&#x27;s how mafia bosses get jailed.<p>>>> As is the case for people seeking public office. They must follow rules that ordinary people will probably never even need to know.<p>People seeking office have same rights as everybody else - because they <i>are</i> everybody else. Any citizen can seek office and has right to do so. When <i>in</i> the office, they have to accept certain limits that come with the job, but when seeking office they are not under any obligation yet, and have absolutely equal rights with any random citizen. All those &quot;campaign finance&quot; laws are just a futile populistic attempt to control political discourse, and Supreme Court is routinely shutting them down as infringing people&#x27;s liberties, and rightfully so.",1396504685

That is untrue. There are people willing to pay good money for nonvoting stock.<p>Imagine a dual-class share company. Class B shares cannot vote. Class A shares can vote - they own 100% of the vote share. But both classes are <i>pari passu</i> in economic terms - if Class A gets a $1 dividend Class B must receive the same. Further, let there be 1 Class A (voting) share and 999,999 Class B (non-voting) shares.

The only time the difference (or &quot;spread&quot;) matters is in the event of a proxy fight or takeover, i.e. a contest of control. The spread is a function of the probability that your vote is decisive - that absent your vote there would be a tie - in a meaningful contest of control.

What is the problem with retrospective-scare-quoted studies ? I personally have more problems with non-retrospective studies for obvious reasons.<p>Like all academic papers there are loads of problems with the research and conclusions, mostly stemming from an inability to do real experiments on humans and limited budgets, and of course these do introduce caveats. But if you&#x27;re going to start judging papers on sample size ... first you don&#x27;t understand statistics, secondly these guys are using more people than most (because it&#x27;s such a widespread phenomenon, it&#x27;s easy to get a big sample size of course, but still).<p>And frankly, artificially limiting your intake of different foods ... results in some chemicals not being available to your body ... first of course results in weight loss (because a lot of these require a lot of chemical energy to manufacture, or can&#x27;t be manufactured at all) ... and then result in bigger problems.<p>It is only outside of medical circles that the benefits of modern food are in question. Nobody in the medical establishment doubts that processed, meaty and fatty foods are pretty much the best nutrition possible for the human body. Just yesterday I read an article about what everyone thought was an epidemic of the plague, at the end of the last century in Chicago. It wasn&#x27;t, it was contaminated grain that made it into bread, was effectively invisible, and quite deadly. For obvious reasons this grain was grown perfectly natural, if only because modern stuff didn&#x27;t exist yet. Yes, it makes you fat. Yes, there are historical screwups (not nearly as much screwups as with &quot;natural&quot; food of course, but somehow the screwups with industrial food are judged infinitely more important).<p>And yes, there are some, including medical researchers and so on, that doubt the morality of processed foods. I find this distasteful. Medical research and all science should first and foremost be value-free. Morality should be shut out (with the potential exception of describing methods to do direct large scale damage, ie. I find it acceptable that the exact gene sequence and samples for say the bubonic plague does require you to sign a letter you won&#x27;t use it for nefarious purposes, even if I would have major problems with similar requirements for the cure).",1396502071

So you have functions that have lots of options, but only ever get called once with one set of parameters.  The fix is to rewrite everything so that the abstractions are taylored to the task at hand.<p>What you are describing is a kind of excessive elegance.  But this is fairly independent of the problem I described (and the article is describing).<p>I&#x27;ll also say that there is a limit to bloat, and LOC is often a good guide to functionality.  E.g. if I&#x27;m interesting in re-implementing something, I&#x27;ll first look at the weight of the code.

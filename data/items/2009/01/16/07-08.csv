The cost of provisioning service to a single user of a site is effectively zero, close enough that it can seem worthwhile to give it away in order to expand your userbase. Unfortunately, in doing so, you lose the revenue stream which has supported businesses since the dawn of commerce.""",1232092466

436322,comment,436163,436227,0,0,patio11,,,"I think that, fundamentally, a lot of startup founders don't charge money because they lack the confidence to ask people for it.  Which is crazy, because the people who would be your customers spend tens of thousands of dollars a year on things they care about less than your software.<p>I know I was TERRIFIED of charging money 2.5 years ago.  What if it breaks?!  What if there is a bug?!  What if no one cares about what I'm doing?!  But charging money is the BEST MEDICINE for this fear because <i>people will pay you money</i>.  And after that happens a few thousand times, you start to lose the sense of ""zomg, I am totally unworthy of being compensated for improving people's lives, perhaps I could put out a tip jar in a suitably discrete location and hope some money falls into it.""",1232092268

Startup acquisitions are usually a build-vs-buy decision for the acquirer. Should we buy this little startup or build our own?

436305,comment,435790,436233,0,0,Scriptor,,,"Actually, French is S-O-V when you're using pronouns. Some quick testing with Google Translate suggests that Spanish might follow the same rule as well.<p>My first language, Bengali, an Indo-European language spoken in Bangladesh and thus distantly related to Latin, is S-O-V. I'm assuming from this that Hindi and other Indian subcontinental languages are as well.<p>I think S-O-V makes sense when communicating visually. Say someone kicks a ball. Initially you see a person and a ball. Then you see the person kick it. The action comes after the presence of the two objects. You don't see a person, see him kick, and only then see the ball.",1232091370

(This applies esp. to languages like C/C++, Python, Ruby, LISP, ... and even though I know them inside out; I've not been able to find a certification program in them).<p>Some employers test their candidates, but others just believe in what you write. I know of a PHP programmer who listed in a resume a bunch of languages (LISP, Ruby, etc.) that he didn't know for a job that involved PHP programming. The employer didn't check whether he actually knew those languages, and it certainly increased his odds of success compared to his peers who had been more truthful. In the end he got the job.<p>I think it would be good to have certifications that prove to your employers that you know the languages well. There are well-established  certification programs for Java, Oracle, etc. I'm wondering if there are any reputable companies/institutes offering certification in languages like PHP, Perl, Python, C/C++, etc.",1232090771

As the number of connections goes up, their individual value would seem to go down.  Beyond that being basic economics, you're setting yourself up to be limited in the kinds of additional things you can do as the meaning behind the individual connections approaches zero.<p>If twitter added some metadata behind the ability to create connections, like allowing users to group their connections into buckets (initially preconfigured to encourage meaningful use) like ""co-workers"", ""friends"", etc and let you filter what you publish and what you subscribe to in different ways, it could work.

If you think about this logically people on the web actually go to great lengths to avoid ads.  This idea relies on people willingly staying subscribed to ad-based-twitter accounts.  Doesn't seem likely to me.<p>The article suggests that advertisers will just ""have to remain interesting"" but put in traditional terms that would be the equivalent of making a new commercial each time you needed one (rather than just replaying the same one like companies do now).

Bonuses are very high, but these vary from year to year and shouldn't be taken for granted (not to say that people don't).<p>I made this change. I'm 26 and have no kids. My girlfriend's in school but will be able to support both of us when she's out. It's mildly annoying not to have a maid and nice vacations right now, but working on interesting problems is more important than having those comforts, which are disposable for now (you don't need help until you have kids, really). Then again, I can also still afford basic necessities; if I couldn't, I'd have to go back to Wall Street.<p>The major problem in New York is that rent is ridiculous. Most ""lifestyle"" factors (vacations, alcohol) are flexible and can be deferred for a few years, but rent is non-negotiable. If it stays this high, the city will bleed talent too fast to reach ""critical mass"". You want the freshly unemployed quants (although quants are among the last to be let go) to stick around in the city for 6 months, not move back in with their parents because of New York rent.<p>Regarding lifestyle expenses, any guess as to where top traders spend most of their leisure income? Gambling. I never thought I'd meet people smarter than me who find ""games"" like Roulette and Craps to be interesting and worth playing (because I'm a game designer and a Euro-snob who'd rather play Tigris than Poker) but I have. This is because it's visceral and not intellectual-- people with the ""gambling gene"" make great traders but I wouldn't want one as a co-founder (long digression omitted).<p>I'm going to bet on the Midwest as the startup hub of the 2010s. There are a lot of brilliant graduates of schools like Chicago, Northwestern, Carleton, Michigan, and Grinnell whose graduates (for geographic reasons) are not nearly as likely to go to Wall Street (or Silicon Valley) as their coastal counterparts. Most of them go into graduate school, seeing that as the best option for them, because often it is.

And it's solely because this area is just not as mature as there. There are the investors that are smart and are willing to take the risks (Founder's Collective, USV, FRC, Flybridge etc.), but the problem is that they are few and far between relative to earlystage VCs and angels on the west coast. Therefore, because they're smart, have branding and don't have serious competition, they DON'T have to take the risk. And why would they, who would blame them? They can wait until the company is almost completely de-risked before they move in. (I guess an argument here is that it's a good thing that the early stage investing industry is small and less risky here. If they succeed more will come.)<p>The other investors here (the wall streeters turned VCS) just don't get it. They're not investing, as you say, in ""change the world"" ideas.

Or rather, in others' working with same.<p>Some years ago, I was in an accounting position.  We hired a newly minted junior staff member.  Requests would come in for certain figures, and he would turn to our admittedly half-baked reporting (inherited, and faulty due not so much to original design as to failure to spend to keep it and its data structures current).  He'd generate a a number, graph, etc. out of the system and spend zero effort considering or investigating its validity.  If it came out of the system (aka black box), it must be correct.<p>When the number was used intra-department, I or someone else had an opportunity to double-check and to correct mistaken assumptions.  When the number was requested externally, mis-perceptions could quickly propagate, and their correction became troublesome.<p>I have similar concerns with the data behind current visualization trends.  How many people know what is truly going into them, and how much in the way of resources is being invested to ensure that the underlying data are correct?<p>Something I find particularly troublesome with the Obama administration's initially supplying only ""summary information"" in some if not all of its ""open access"" initiatives.  If I have only the summary, and based upon my past experience, I have limited trust in what I'm being supplied.<p>Another example of this seemingly endemic ""failure to verify"", from a different domain.  I've done some QA work in the software field, and all too often fellow QA'a have taken specifications as facts.  They don't investigate whether the specifications reflect what was actually developed.  Testing becomes a matter of confirming the most basic details, while ignoring real confirmation of underlying functionality much less seeking out and interrogating corner cases.<p>These testers have been people with four year college degrees and who have seemingly made QA their career.

The laptop’s power circuitry bypasses the battery unless it’s needed. Depending on how smart the charger is, it may occasionally poll and “top off” the battery if its charge decreases to a certain threshold below 100%, but this is rarely needed in practice.<p>Not strictly true.<p>If you plug in your macbook, your battery is still being used. Evidently the power supply actually cannot meet the peak power demand of the system, so the battery needs to be there to provide for that [1] [2]. Apple also feels that the conditioning the battery receives while it interacts with a powered system increases its longevity.<p>Generally the power adapter provides more power than your machine is using, so obviously it can charge. But if you remove your battery and benchmark your system, you'll find that your system is limiting itself back about 20-30% to account for the lack of battery.<p>References:

1153379,story,,,3,1,ronzensci,"Ask HN: Is doing a PhD from Oxford a better option than a Research based Job?",,"I have got an admit for distributed computing in wireless sensors at Oxford University. After my M.S. and a couple of years of working in the silicon valley, I was inclined to look for a job in an innovative startup or an industry research lab. But because of being on a H1B, I could not find anything satisfactory in the time-frame I had (I had to urgently look for a job between March '09 and July '09 - and couldn't find anything at that time). 
Hence, rather than settling for a 'mundane' job, I decided to apply for a PhD. Now, after getting an admit at Oxford, I am at a crossroad- should I go in for a three year doctoral program or hold out for that 'Research focused Job' that I am looking for. 
Some factors to consider are- I am currently self-employed in my home country working on a well-paying but uncertainity laden freelance consulting gigs.<p>My topic of interest is here:

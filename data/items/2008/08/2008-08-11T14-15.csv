Here in DC, we have the second-highest ridership in the country, and somehow these nincompoops can't get the system to pay for itself. Never mind that we don't have month passes like in most normal cities, and that somebody who regularly rides the Metro will easily spend in excess of $200, even $300 per month. Thanks for hiking fares again, guys! And the number of cars, stations, and miles of track almost certainly pale in comparison to those in New York.<p>Hell, I pay $140/month to take the Orange line two stops west and a flat-fee bus to its second stop on the route. And people wonder why we have such awful traffic: Driving is often cheaper!",1218466434

No editor: you either write them and hand them to a typist or punch them manually.  Even simple typos and syntax errors don't come back for half an hour or more.<p>So yeah, a factor of five for a typical programmer sounds about right to me.  Truly great hackers might get closer (because they aren't as limited by tool overhead), but a typical IT wonk would be utterly lost in that environment and do much worse.",1218466028

I'm a web designer/developer and the software suite I use everyday from Adobe costs roughly $1000 (every 2 years because I skip generations).  The operating system I use everyday (even when I'm not designing) cost me at most a couple hundred dollars (prob less because it's pre-loaded)<p>Adobe is just plain greedy, which is criticism that could be applied to MS as well, but dollar for dollar MS is raping me <i>much</i> less.",1218465684

272990,comment,272814,272838,0,0,msluyter,,,"I'll second that, and it goes beyond mere marketing. For example, you're outside at some group event, say, a concert, and you find yourself having a heart attack. What do you do? Do you call for help? ""Help, I'm having a heart attack!"" That might work, but what works better, according to research, is to call out to a single individual. ""You, sir, in the red shirt, yes you! Help me, I'm having a heart attack."" This is due to the phenomenon known as ""pluralistic ignorance,"" where a group of people will collectively do nothing in response to some threat/problem, because they're collectively looking around at each other to see what to do (and they see each other doing nothing but looking around...) By singling out someone, you break through the group psychology.<p>The book emphasizes the subconscious and automatic nature of influence techniques. You may think ""oh, I'm rational and can't be manipulated,"" and you would be wrong. Only becoming aware of them can you have some hope of avoiding them.",1218465244

Peldi's entrepreneurial spirit is contagious.<p>The major problem with this form of advertising is that it takes a person with tact, diplomacy, and self control to do it right. If Twitter supports the '$1 / $$ message' universally it will attract many advertisers lacking any if all of those characteristics. That could result in a diluted user experience and eventual spamization of the system.<p>Still, in its purest form (and micro doses), this is a great way to perform grassroots marketing.",1218465101

--<p>Adobe will offer U.S. Web surfers this month thousands of hours of free video direct from the Olympics in Beijing.<p>The service, produced in conjunction with NBC, is being hailed as a bold experiment in delivering on the original promise of the Web. For the first time, it will be possible to watch specific events on demand as well as many of the less popular sporting events, which have received scant attention in mainstream television coverage of the games.<p>But there's a catch. To view the video, it will be necessary to download a Adobe Web browser software component based on a new proprietary technology, Flash, that is intended to make it possible to display interactive animations, graphics, audio and video, all within a fixed window inside a Web browser display.<p>Flash will work for both Macintosh and Windows PC users, and a version for Linux is also available.

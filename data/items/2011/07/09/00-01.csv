In fact with all static members you don't have to worry about synchronizing initialization of the singleton object which is often done wrong.<p>The only reason to use a singleton over static members is that it feels like OO. I suppose it also makes it easier to replace the singleton with a 'multiton' at some point in the future which somewhat justifies it.",1310173142

Every discipline has different terminology, so I imagine what might work for Chemists might not work for Engineers.  In our lab, we didn't have very many chemicals, but we had certain instruments setup with finite lifetime values.<p>2) Also at first glance, I thought this was a lab notebook replacement or supplement.  Now that would have been awesome. Going back over my _many_ pages of notes over the years was a pain in the ass, especially when it came down to writing proposals and papers.  I'm sure there is a huge opportunity in digitizing this to make lab notes searchable, reference-able, more organized, and even more secure.<p>3) To reach students, I would suggest to hitting up large conferences.

Despite being called ""Singleton Considered Stupid,"" much of the article is not about singletons at all, and he barely addresses why singletons are bad. The actual arguments, buried 3/4 of the way into the article, boil down to a) resource/memory management problems, and b) that in the future, you might possibly need more than one object of anything you decide to make a singleton. (He mentions multithreading too, but that is just silly; e.g. even if I had multiple Log objects, there would need to be synchronization at some point if I'm outputting to the same stream). He writes numerous times that it's bad OOP, or ""OOP made easy,"" because it is too much like procedural programming, but only mentions the factory-method pattern as an alternative at the very end of the article, and doesn't actually say WHY it's better. The necessity for, or at least temptation of global state is not even mentioned.",1310171340

2744634,comment,2743874,2743874,11,0,redthrowaway,,,"Not surprising.  Many of these players come from a lower class background where financial literacy is not taught to them.  They likely got through school with the minimum of effort, protected by coaches, teachers, and administrators because they ""were good ball players"".  If they went to college, it was on a basketball scholarship where their preferential treatment would continue.<p>In short, they've never had to think about anything besides basketball.  They go from rags to riches without anyone telling them the obvious: it won't last.  Their heroes spend big money on flashy cars and houses, and when you're staring at a seven figure cheque that might seem like a good idea.<p>They likely grew up in a household where their parents lived paycheque to paycheque, and simply being able to provide for yourself and afford luxuries was considered being smart with your money.  They probably thought of their houses and cars as investments, because thinking of them as million dollar wasteful extravagances is depressing.  They wouldn't have made the connection that an investment is not something that's expensive, it's something that makes you money.<p>The average NBA player is raised to play basketball, and that's it.  They end up being very good at basketball, and little else.  If they are amongst the small cadre who think about life after basketball, then they likely won't be broke.  It doesn't even take any special knowledge to be able to live well off $100M in career earnings.  They just need to go to a financial adviser and have someone else look after their money.

2744603,comment,2743894,2744062,7,0,ebiester,,,"Since you handwaved over ""a much better design exists,"" I thought I'd give an example.<p>So, you have an app deployed to seven customers. The typical pattern is you develop an app for a first customer. It is then sold to subsequent customers, doing the least possible to make it work. In this case, as I have seen in the past, you have a properties file, saying which classes to use and which configuration options the customer has available.<p>These are then loaded up, as global state, so that your code can ask, ""Does this application have Widget Processing capabilities?"" and gets the answer for its code path. Consider:<p><pre><code>  if (AppProperties.getInstance().hasWidgetProcessing() {\n    process(widget); \n  }\n</code></pre>\nNow, the problems here are pretty obvious. Since you're depending on a single file, your testing is a bear. Getting to the various codepaths is nigh impossible. Ideologically, it's bad design because your software has a bunch of if or switch statements in the code to decide what it should really do.<p>Now, what would make this code better? Well, you could start with taking all your Widget Processing capabilities and putting them in their own object or package. Then, instead of the above, your code looks like this:<p><pre><code>  public class WidgetImpl implements Widget {\n\n    private WidgetProcessor widgetProcessor;\n\n    public void process() {\n      widgetProcessor.process(this)\n    } \n\n    public void setWidgetProcessor(WidgetProcessor wp) {\n      this.widgetProcessor = wp;\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIn your main code:<p><pre><code>  widget.process();\n</code></pre>\nWidgetProcessor has two (or more) implementations, in this case: RealWidgetProcessor and NullWidgetProcessor. NullWidgetProcessor just returns without doing anything.\nNow, how does your Widget get the proper widget processor? Dependency injection. <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/wiki/Motivation?tm=6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/wiki/Motivation?tm=6</a> has a pretty good explanation.<p>Improvements on the design are welcomed, as always. :) Though for simplicity's sake I was trying to keep code to a minimum. Now, speaking of code, my main issue with dependency injection is that the code baloons, especially in java. DI as a pattern makes me feel like there's something missing in current language implementations that would make this more elegant. Aspect-oriented programming was one try at it, but it seems that the cure is worse than the disease in that case.",1310169996

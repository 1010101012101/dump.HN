The Sony Vaio Z series is <i>packed</i> and quite expensive if you really load it out.<p>I would point out that the scrolling/zooming/multi-touch experience in Windows 7 on these other devices is no where near as fluid as the MBA; I don't know how important that is to you, but once I realized how herky-jerky it was going to be that was a turn off for me and how I was using my laptop.<p>Also the hardware loadout in the MBA compared to some of these other devices actually ends up making the MBA really competitively priced, especially when you add the SSD to the likes of the Sony Vaio Z which got quite expensive.<p>As always it depends what you want to do with the laptop (gaming? programming? web?) but just know that if OS X/Win isn't an issue the hardware on all these high end ultra lights is within the same ballpark and not night/day different.",1314539579

Yes, it's probably easier with huge centralized installations (he actually observed that at this point the centralization offers advantages over the decentralized model.) But his main point was not about spam nor even about e-mail in general. His point was that it is worth putting the additional effort into making decentralized systems work.

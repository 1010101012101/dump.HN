9322514,comment,9320929,9321833,0,0,skwirl,,,"I have been starting to learn how to write mobile applications with  Xamarin to contribute to a friend&#x27;s project and had not heard of Xamarin University until I saw this comment.  Now that I have looked at it, I&#x27;m a little confused.  I can understand charging for 1-on-1 help, interactive classes, and certification exams, but why wouldn&#x27;t &quot;recorded class videos, class labs and materials&quot; be free?  Don&#x27;t you <i>want</i> it to be easy for people to use your software so that people <i>will?</i>  Charging $1995/year for learning materials seems pretty steep.<p>The learning investment is what makes me most hesitant to use Xamarin.  It was supposed to be less of a learning investment because we all have C#/.NET experience, but now I&#x27;m not so sure.  It now seems like we&#x27;re going to have to dive deep into learning iOS and Android specific UI concepts anyway, and on top of that learn Xamarin concepts and quirks, and if we want to continue using Visual Studio when the trial is up we&#x27;ll have to pay $1000/year.  Maybe we&#x27;re just not the target market.",1428188344

Then to complete the image of the tortured artist, publicly lamented the fad that had grown around him, insisting that nobody &quot;got it&quot; that nobody &quot;understood his work&quot; yet refused to provide any coherent explanation of what it was about.<p>Thought experiment: what if Rothko and other modern painters were the ones being conned? What if wealthy people, lusting for something different with which they could lavish themselves and the world (in their name of course), just needed a few naive but <i>hopeful</i> people who considered themselves artists or painters? What if, in exchange for money and acclaim, they were pressured to <i>produce</i> but never <i>clarify</i> for fear of losing their livelihood, feeling disgraced, or lost after spending so many years exploring a certain path?<p>I don&#x27;t mean for any of those to come off as loaded questions, just riffing on the topic while curious about how people here have approached the topic themselves.",1428188324

He&#x27;s virtually the worst of the worst well know modern artists. A pretentious, talentless hack who, with no discernible skill or even an interesting process or story, managed to ride a wave of modern art garbage that was fashionable for a hot moment and put him on the radar. He&#x27;s as detestable as the people who made him famous, a group who turned the field of visual art into a talentless, skill-free, farce that the art world is only now starting to recover from, but has churned out tens-of-thousands of &quot;artists&quot; who think using words like &quot;semiotics&quot; and &quot;human condition&quot; while randomly rubbing paint on a flat surface produces something that moves us forward as a species.<p>The only kind thing I think I can say about his work is that, like raw sewage, at least it&#x27;s all instantly recognizable no matter where you see it. Huge &quot;lookatmelookatme&quot; canvases with squares painted on squares in whatever color the paint bucket next to him happened to have in it when he decided he need to make some money that month to make rent. Work laid on canvas in a herculean effort that must have taken no more than 60-90 seconds of the artist&#x27;s labor and preparation -- cranked out with all the flourish of a fast food hamburger -- over 800 pieces.<p>Being able to instantly recognize his work is important because it lets me immediately know to avoid that part of the gallery, it&#x27;s saved me the world over, from the NGA to the Tate Modern.<p>I sound like a modern art hater, but I&#x27;m not. There&#x27;s a lot of great modern art out there, even some that takes quite a bit of work on the part of the viewer to appreciate. But I&#x27;ve never found anything even remotely interesting about Rothko&#x27;s work. It has all the &quot;art&quot; of an amateurish custom bedroom paint job. I find it inconceivable that nobody has bothered to write the 20 lines of code necessary to just algorithmically generate an unlimited supply of this wall garbage.<p>My summary is that I think he&#x27;s a con man who figured out how to insert himself into art circles and game rich pretentious patrons into parting with their money, who then justifying the purchase of trite oversized dentist office paintings by building a minor cult around him. Then to complete the image of the tortured artist, publicly lamented the fad that had grown around him, insisting that nobody &quot;got it&quot; that nobody &quot;understood his work&quot; yet refused to provide any coherent explanation of what it was about.<p>Heaven save us from modernists.",1428185570

There are video-streaming protocols. There are p2p data-exchange protocols. Some of them need more friendly end-user tools to become widespread, but still, they do their job and usually are introduced as having some feature, which &quot;all the previous stuff&quot; lacked.<p>So what <i>exactly</i> is IPFS and why I would use it over… whatever else I can use to share files? After all, it&#x27;s a protocol, and not an end-user tool yet, right? So what does this protocol present us? What exactly all that &quot;p2p, decentralized&quot; stuff means in the case of this very protocol?<p>Why I&#x27;m asking it here and not seeking answer in documentation and source-code? Well, there&#x27;s quite a real reason beyond my laziness: from what I&#x27;ve understood so far, it seems like some pretty ambitious project.

These days with call setup being 100% digital the trace information is available immediately (rather than after some fictional period of time with an open line) so why not provide this as a service to phone subscribers?

Say for example you want to showcase some algorithm that you say performs 10% better than chance (in some field where that confers a significant time/$ advantage), this gives you a meaningful benchmark to measure against. And since all the random data is stored, it makes certification of scientific papers much more repeatable since they can just show longs of when the NIST server was accessed in the materials & methods section of a paper.

I remember reading awhile back that Weebly was accepted into the first YC class after redesign YC&#x27;s website in five minutes during their interview. Between the companies in YC&#x27;s portfolio that specialize in web design and the technical expertise of probably every YC partner, a more modern redesign would be trivial. So that leads me to my question: Why had YC decided to keep its early design? Is it just because it&#x27;s not necessary? Is there a specific reason why the current design is optimal? Is a redesign planned but just extremely low priority?<p>Edit: This is referring to www.ycombinator.com NOT Hacker News",1395719733

That will tell you how far the transmitter is from the receiver.<p>Do this several times, and you can make a constellation of possible locations, and then fit those points to a line.<p>Globalstar does this with its satellite phones. Their situation is easier than with Inmarsat, because Globalstar uses fast-moving (relative to points on Earth) LEO satellites rather than geostationary satellites. Given a single LEO satellite on a known orbit and assuming that the phone on the ground is stationary, a fix on position can be made relatively quickly using the Doppler effect.<p>Here&#x27;s a paper about how Globalstar does it: <a href=""http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~nadav/pdf-files/Instant_active_positioning_with_one_LEO_satellite.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~nadav/pdf-files/Instant_active_pos...</a>",1395719376

On top of that you&#x27;ve been working for a salary that probably paid all your existing living expenses so you were not accumulating debt.

Compare it to Wall Street. Yes, Wall Street.<p>Forget whatever negative image you have of banks or hedge funds. Whatever negative thing you might say about those also applies to most VC-funded startups. (After all, most VCs are ex-finance guys, MBAs who didn&#x27;t do well enough in school to get into stat arb.) 95% of startups have worse hours than IT or quant or S&T roles in banks. (Analyst programs are a different mess.) 95% of startups have no moral edge in terms of mission or management ethics. 95% of startups fire more quickly and with less severance (sometimes zero, plus a ruined reputation because shit happens when arrogant kids fall into power) than any bank. 95% of startups aren&#x27;t giving more interesting work to non-founder engineers than large companies (being CTO or first engineer might be cool, but a typical engineering role is inferior) do. 95% of startups don&#x27;t have the prestige for their more liberal titles/promotions to actually carry durable weight.<p>So, there&#x27;s literally no good reason to choose the startup ecosystem, <i>unless you have a rare informational advantage</i>, over Wall Street. Are there excellent startups out there? Yes, there are. I would argue that very few people have the skills necessary to tell the good few apart from the worthless many.<p>In the <i>successes</i>, the typical employee equity payout, vested over 4 years, is the kind of bonus banks give when they&#x27;re looking to fire someone nicely (i.e. the &quot;we&#x27;ll disappoint him out&quot; bonus).<p>Also, acquisitions are generally terrible for regular employees in terms of position, rank, etc. So you should literally think of liquidation as a severance, because the odds are high that the acquirer already has someone doing your job and he has the political edge. And $200k after taxes is <i>really</i> rare for an employee startup payout. That might be 98th percentile. I&#x27;ve seen lots of zeros in acquisitions considered &quot;successful&quot; by Techcrunch.<p>It really is a fucking scam, but it&#x27;s not just a problem with startups. Software people are terrible at looking out for their own interests. Engineers either need to become savvy and self-interested like hedge fund quants and get what they&#x27;re worth, or bring back the out-of-fashion but powerful concept of collective bargaining.",1395718714

7463639,comment,7463063,7463423,29,0,devconsole,,,"Perhaps the scariest thing is their plan to collect and store all data on all of your activities, then retroactively mine it.  That is, from the moment you use the internet for the first time as a 9 year old until the day you die as an 89 year old, every text message you send, every email you write, every website you visit, and (if you&#x27;re thinking of becoming a politician) every nude picture you send can potentially be used against you.<p>The reason this is scary isn&#x27;t just because of the present social climate.  The current social climate is actually pretty decent.  The reason it&#x27;s scary is because social climates can change quickly.  A couple decades from now, what you did legally today may be illegal.  If you&#x27;re pursued and prosecuted, it&#x27;s possible someone may dig through this vast trove of collected data and use it against you.<p>Clapper (the head of the NSA) has taken the stance that it&#x27;s okay to collect everything, and that a &quot;search&quot; hasn&#x27;t taken place until some human actually tries to look through that data.  He frequently uses the analogy of a library: it&#x27;s okay for the NSA to have all the books (everyone&#x27;s data, everywhere) because a search hasn&#x27;t taken place until they take one of the books off the shelf and look through it.<p>The temptation to use that library for purposes other than curbing terrorism must be pretty strong.<p>I&#x27;m going to speculate for the sake of example.  It was often cited that one of the reasons for the 9/11 attacks was that the agencies weren&#x27;t cooperating.  As such, there has been a lot of pressure for the agencies to work together since then.  I&#x27;m going to guess that if the FBI hadn&#x27;t eventually tracked down DPR on their own, they may have tried to turn to the NSA for help.  While it&#x27;s not clear that the NSA has those kinds of capabilities, they&#x27;re certainly more capable than the FBI at breaching the Tor network.  There are slides out there which say something along the lines of &quot;... we&#x27;re able to deanonymize individual targets, not everybody at once.&quot;<p>That example is a little bit unrelated to &quot;collecting all data about everybody and then mining it,&quot; but remember that if the agencies begin cooperating in that fashion, sharing that trove of data may be the next logical step.<p>I apologize for speculating, and my speculation should be treated as such.  But please realize that just because they&#x27;re not doing that to Americans yet doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re not doing it to citizens of other countries with impunity today.<p>Here&#x27;s another ancillary point. It should be no surprise that the NSA could probably find out the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto pretty easily.  But my point in bringing that up is this: if Satoshi himself cannot stay anonymous, then what hope do any of us have?  Anonymity may be dead at this point.  It&#x27;s pretty clear that humans will continue to live even if that&#x27;s the case, but a world without privacy is going to be a very strange one.<p>By the way, I should also mention that the GCHQ may be even more capable than the NSA.  There are signs that the NSA are better at pulling off attacks (Stuxnet, Tailored Access Operations) but that GCHQ are better at collecting data (bypassed Google&#x27;s encryption).  It has also been hinted that whenever the NSA runs into roadblocks against investigating Americans, they enlist the help of the GCHQ since it&#x27;s legal for them to do so (and vice-versa).  So even if the NSA is reformed, there is still this spectre of this worldwide data collection and governmental collaboration hovering over society.",1395718207

For some observations to back up your view:<p>A quick market analysis (aka, a Google search) finds this video ( <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0weojd1crNQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0weojd1crNQ</a> ) which shows how manually intensive it is to make a custom dress shirt.<p>That comes from Deo Veritas. The cheapest shirt they offer is $50. The shirt is made in Hong Kong, and takes several weeks to deliver. The FAQ says USPS charges $15 to send a first class package to Hong Kong, so with profit I expect the shirt costs about $25 to manufacture.<p>Checking now, you can&#x27;t make shirts in Asia and have them shipped to the US within 48 hours at that price point. FedEx International Economy (48 hour delivery) for the shirt costs $50 from Hong Kong to San Francisco.<p>Which means you&#x27;ll need to make it in the US, or more likely Mexico.  Which is why you need to get $100 million to make this idea work. You&#x27;ll need to set up a maquiladora just across the border, get the building and equipment, set up a supply chain for the fabric, and plan for enough sales to be able to make the investors happy.<p>Minimum wage for garment workers in Mexico is about US$6/hour. Minimum wage in Hong Kong is under $4/hour. Assuming most of the $25 is in labor costs in Hong Kong, that same basic shirt would cost about $35 to make in Mexico.<p>This is above your price point.<p>More expensive shirts take more time to make. Once the labor differential between Mexico and Asia exceeds $60 (the price for FedEx international priority), your Asian competitors can undercut you.<p>FWIW, I have no idea if these numbers are right. I have no expertise in this field. But if you (the OP, not rufusjones) can&#x27;t do this sort of back-of-the-envelope calculations, then perhaps you shouldn&#x27;t enter this business.",1395717440

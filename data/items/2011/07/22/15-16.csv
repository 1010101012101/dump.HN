The big delta would be to get the number of data centers that Google has).<p>I think its a sound strategy, but they're going to need to more than double their current marketshare before they break even.

I'm under the impression that on a lot of sites (such as where you got your homepage theme ;)) you need to buy a special license if you're going to offer multiple users access to the same theme (e.g. akin to running a wordpress-mp site and letting users choose from themes you have purchased).

With that in mind, only incredibly foolhardy individuals would do so for the sake of mere convenience--a much more serious motivation would be required for most people.  In a large enough organization, <i>someone</i> would most likely do it anyway, but it wouldn't be nearly common enough to leave ""high security networks...sitting wide open.""<p>Really, the only plausible scenario for significant leakage of classified information is deliberate espionage.  I'm not sure why people keep citing Manning as setting some sort of precedent or revealing a previously unknown vulnerability, because this type of espionage has been going on since the beginning of recorded history, and probably even before that.  It's the reason why access to classified information requires both a clearance <i>and</i> ""need to know.""  When ""need to know"" rules are relaxed or ignored, it becomes relatively easy for people to take information that they have no business accessing and simply walk out of the building with it, whether it be hard-copies or soft-copies.  This tends to go in cycles, with ""need to know"" rules gradually loosening until a major incident occurs, after which they are rapidly tightened, and then the whole process repeats.  There was a rash of such incidents all at once in the mid-'80s:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985:_The_Year_of_the_Spy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985:_The_Year_of_the_Spy</a>",1311350167

2794011,comment,2792106,2792213,1,0,Udo,,,"To a degree. When Steve Jobs came back to Apple for the second time and the company was going under, he actually made it a point in keynote presentation that the collaboration with Adobe (especially as far as Photoshop was concerned) should be intensified. A few years later, the CEO of Adobe appeared on a Stevenote and he was <i>extremely</i> enthusiastic about Apple.<p>I'm not sure what happened then, but one factor might have been Apple developing their own software to replace Photoshop, Aftereffects and other creative tools. That couldn't have been good for their relationship.<p>From the user perspective, dumping Flash is still a good idea. If only web video didn't rely on it, everyone could just uninstall it or at least they'd all run a Flash blocker plugin that was enabled by default in browsers. So I guess the hate triangle between Apple, Adobe and their users built up to the point where Adobe staff just go ""whatever"" when there's a technical problem on the Mac.<p>Adobe's best bet is now the Windows world, where there are much less viable alternatives to its creative suite and where there are less geeks around who like to install Flash blockers. It also makes sense from a business perspective as the Windows platform seems to be much more enamored with keeping legacy apps functioning.

Europeans officials have confirmed that a 109 billion aid package is underway.  In addition to this, financial institutions that currently own Greek bonds will contribute 50 billion through 2014 through a combination of debt extensions and the discounted purchase of these Greek bonds on the secondary market.  What is important to note is that this will still constitute as a selective default by the rating agencies.  A selective default is used to describe when the terms of a bond are changed (either in rate or term  in this case it looks like both because the maturity of the existing bonds will be pushed from 7.5 years to 15 years and rates will be set to 3.5%).  The European Central Bank (ECB), an active money lender to European governments, previously warned that even a selective default would prohibit the ECB from lending to Greek banks, due to collateral issues (essentially expressing an unwillingness to blindly lend money to weak financial institutions that are in default).  However, it appears as though the European governments are willing to guarantee any defaulted Greek debt offered as collateral at money market operations, which would ensure that the ECB was covered in a worst case scenario (i.e. if Greek banks are not able to repay the ECB back, in which case the European governments  through their guarantee  would be on the hook).

2793892,comment,2793227,2793227,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"First, let me point out that once again we are comparing Java - a runtime, a language platform and an entire ecosystem comprising many frameworks - with Rails, a specific web framework designed with a specific philosophy (opinionated defaults that work in 90% of cases, YAGNI, etc.) for a specific range of uses (""rapidly prototyping a small-to-moderately sized web site"").<p>So just because Rails developers hate something doesn't mean it's generally evil. It might just be wrong for Rails. Many things are; otherwise Rails would have no texture. Saying no to things is what design is about.<p>Now let's talk about hate. Everyone hates something. There is nothing wrong with hating things. Hate is just personal taste turned up to eleven. You should strive to hate politely and with grace, to realize that other people love the things you hate and are nonetheless human, and probably even smart. And you should strive to remember that there's an important difference between the things you hate and things that objectively suck. Java, for example, does not suck. Not always. Lots of work has gone into it. Lots of Java-based tools are essential. There are big classes of problem for which Java is currently the best solution.<p>Nonetheless, I hate Java. It is a handy mental shortcut, one that has yet to lead me astray. My belief is that the problems for which Java-the-language is the solution are problems I don't want to work on, and that I don't have enough time in my life to address the problems I <i>do</i> want to work on, so I should simply develop a Java allergy that kicks in whenever I see the generics syntax and that causes my eyes to water until I flee towards fresh air. It works well.<p>(What's sad is when you find yourself hating something that <i>is</i> smack-dab in the middle of a set of problems that you want to work on. Hello, PHP! This requires a much richer set of coping techniques than simple allergic avoidance.)<p>(And, of course, Java is not just a language, and JRuby appears, from the outside, to be awesome, and my curiosity about Clojure is rising, so I may soon temper my simple hatred of Java into a rich melange of love and hate. The stuff of which novels are born, really.)",1311348411

This does mean that American taxpayer funded research is now available to practically everyone in the world.<p>What follows is third hand information and not even directly related to JSTOR. So it could be totally wrong. But I am told that at the moment not all of the journals/articles in all areas are available to universities outside the US. Apparently it is hard to get hold of research related to subjects that the US thinks are not ""exportable"" because of potential impact on national security. Things like nuclear medicine, areas of chemical engineering etc. The journal publishers act as a point of enforcement in this story.",1311347360

The predominant Conservative policies are better described as ""corporatist"" in that they explicitly support corporate interests.<p>In some ways, a free market resembles this, because they both demand that consumer interests practice ""caveat emptor"", because there are fewer regulations that constrain what businesses can do.<p>But contrast to this, a free market system would also refuse to tilt the playing field in favor of the corporations, against the consumer or broader public interests [1]. So rent-seeking policies that institutionalize certain business interests would be avoided, for example. The ""too-big-to-fail"" idea would certainly gain no traction in a free market.<p>[1] While the Conservatives are usually the ones stereotyped as being corporatist, the Liberals are every bit as guilty. Consider such ""left-wing"" policies as ethanol subsidies, or the recent bailout, fostered by Democrats, of GM and Chrysler.",1311347340

Services fall under the second component of network effects known as complementary.[6] A social networking site works the same way as the fax machine described above. The greater number of users with the service, the more valuable the service becomes to the community.

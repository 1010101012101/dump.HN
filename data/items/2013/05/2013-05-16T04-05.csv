5716997,comment,5713981,5716579,8,0,chaz,,,"Let's presume that Google in ~2010 believed that more personal services (like Google Now today) are the future. That requires identification to be layered onto everything they do, including search. But requiring a login for search seems absurd and immediately seems creepy (even if the intent is innocent) and would have been met with intense resistance.<p>It seems a far easier strategy to create a social service where identification is a presumed requirement, and then sprinkle a bit of that across all of the other services. By 2011, half a billion users had been trained by Facebook that logging in with your real identity was the norm. After all, all of your friends were doing it.<p>Thus, Google+ was born. It was the first time that all of Google made a consolidated step toward identification across all of their services. It was a rally point internally and externally, was easily understood, had a clear product roadmap, and opened the door to all kinds of new, stickier products.<p>I think that the expectations of G+ being a Facebook killer were misguided. Google would love to replace the FB News Feed, but I think it's already achieved much of what it set out to do.",1368680335
5716996,comment,5677220,5692261,2,0,wpietri,,,"Responding to some random sentence in the middle of a discussion as if you actually have something relevant to say is annoying, and a big waste of other people's time. If you want to go off on a tangent, say so. Then nobody has to try to figure out what you're on about.<p>Predicting costs is not an inherent benefit. That only is useful if somebody will change a decision based on the prediction. Otherwise, it's wasted effort. My mom was on Medicare throughout her cancer treatment, and I promise you: not knowing the costs was perfectly fine.<p>In fact, not knowing was better. The cognitive load of a major illness is huge. Not knowing is also better for most medical personnel. Their goal should be to maximize patient outcomes. Asking them to juggle some sort of cost-benefit tradeoff in the middle of treatment adds an insane and impossible burden.<p>Also, you quite literally did say ""problem solved"" after proposing SWAG estimation as a solution to a problem. Maybe you wanted me to have some other understanding, but I have no idea what it would be. And, since you admit you are off on some sort of tangent, I don't really care.",1368680318

That is not the same thing as ""can't use GMail in the vanilla mail app on my touchscreen W8 laptop"". In particular, unless the mail app somehow dropped support for SMTP/IMAP, then it will support Gmail perfectly just like any other desktop client.<p>3 - So your complaint is that the Metro version of Chrome does not support some Metro features?

Being able to find the translation of a spoken phrase, or answer a spoken question accurately is actually difficult.

I thought that's exactly what it is.</i><p>Then you were wrong.<p>Flat UI is merely a graphic design choice. If affects the look and overall design of the user interface (flat colors, no drop shadows, remove frills, etc).<p>Everything you otherwise know about the UI and how it works remains the same. Buttons are still buttons, text entry boxes behave as before, radio buttons still let you choose one option, sliders slide, etc etc. You can have a flat UI in Gnome, say, just buy changing the GTK theme to use a flat UI design. Nothing ""massive new UI paradigm"" about it.<p>CLI to GUI is a ""massive new UI paradigm"". GUI to Touch GUI is a ""massive new UI paradigm"". 3D (if somebody implements it in any way that makes sense) would be a ""massive new UI paradigm"".<p>Flat UI is merely a theme change -- plus the adoption of a less ornamental design sensibility. The apps still behave and interact the same. You just don't get corinthian lever, faux-wood bookshelves and old Braun tape machines.<p>><i>There certainly can be a fine line between building on the platform standards and dismantling them, but rewriting all UI components is very much on the side of ""dismantling"".</i><p>Like Apple Pro apps vs regular Apple OS X apps, right? Since they do have ALL the UI components changed. Or like iBooks vs standard iOS look. And tons of other cases where Apple did the same.",1368679952

The NFL is easiest to start with...the stock market would be open during games and each player would have a stock price associated with him. So let's just say I start out with quarterbacks. Tom Brady and Peyton Manning would have large stock prices while Mark Sanchez would probably have a lower stock price. At the same time, for every time Manning or Brady throws an interception, their stock price will fall farther than that of Sanchez if he were to throw an interception. During games, you would be able to buy/sell and trade stock with other players.

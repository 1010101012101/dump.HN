C or C++ for some domains, like embedded systems, drivers, and other heavy-duty systems work.<p>Learning the more esoteric stuff can be fun and can teach some interesting approaches to programming, but they are niche.  Maybe more highly-paid jobs, but the availability is orders of magnitude lower than the more widely-used languages.<p>Not knowing anything else about you than that you are from India, and just going on the experiences I have had working with some Indian subcontractors, doing some Rosetta Stone English would probably be a worthwhile investment.

Not starving but hard-pressed to live solely off her art. Didn&#x27;t complete her college degree, work experience is very minimal, and doesn&#x27;t have any other well-developed skills. Smartly, she wants a backup plan while still pursuing her passion. I&#x27;ve encouraged her to consider tech as an option because: 1) there&#x27;s a push to encourage women in tech which might give her opportunities she wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have; 2) there is much she can learn for free if she&#x27;s self-motivated; 3) she likes the idea of &quot;designing websites to make them look better&quot;; 4) tech skills can be a great source of supplemental income for short durations; 5) I once convinced her to start learning HTML by taking a free course on the Web and she seemed to enjoyed it (but didn&#x27;t stick with it more than a few days on her own); 5) she&#x27;s good with Photoshop.<p>She thinks she could invest a little of her minimal savings to take courses (unclear how much). I&#x27;ve suggested 3 areas to research: graphic design, UI/UX, and programming. I explained that, although GD is where she&#x27;d see the most overlap with her current skills and, thus, be the easiest transition, GD has the least applicability to most tech jobs and likely would be much more useful for certain jobs in advertising/marketing (both of which she&#x27;s not interested in). She really likes the idea of UI/UX but admits her organizational skills aren&#x27;t good and her thinking strikes me as not hierarchical or data-driven (and sometimes even a bit scattered). She thinks she could stay motivated in a coding class because others would be pushing her, but learning on her own isn&#x27;t going to happen.<p>Any advice? She&#x27;s such a good person, enjoys learning, and wants to support herself but self-motivation, especially in the early stages until she develops self-confidence with a particular skill, would be a challenge.",1436798082

  here have stopped paying taxes, the timing might be good. It took me half an 
  hour to do what normally would have taken a morning (most of which would have 
  involved waiting on line).

  In the office I was dealing with, both wickets were open, and I could see the 
  office beyond. Of the five people I could see, two were at the wickets, one was 
  entertaining a succession of visitors who were not conducting business, and two 
  were doing nothing. Just sitting there. Nothing.

  I was there because I have a new (British) passport. I have a password-protected
  file on the Tax Office site, but I cannot change my number myself, because every
  such transaction in Greece begins with the assumption that the client is lying, 
  and therefore this sort of trivial business has to be done in person and the 
  number verified. Fill in a two-page form and present the passport.

  The woman I dealt with - very courteous - entered the information in my file. 
  Then she printed everything as well - several pages, nine stamps, seven 
  signatures. 

  Greece has been promising (to its creditors) to simplify, cut the red tape, 
  reduce the Civil Service, for years, but things only get worse. Syriza re-hired
  the few that the previous government laid off, knowing they didn&#x27;t have money to
  pay for them.

  This is a tiny example of why no one trusts the promises of successive 
  governments. &#x27;Give us the money now, and we&#x27;ll reform later.&#x27;[1]

Bigger places use Java and maybe a few on .NET. WebRTC seems hot, and the frontend would need JS in a browser, but in the backend... Despite Erlang supposedly being &quot;made for telecom&quot;, I&#x27;ve not really seen it be used much. (Yes I&#x27;m aware some big switches use or have used it, just haven&#x27;t seen it in VoIP much.)<p>If I were in the position of trying to get remote work in telephony, I&#x27;d start learning the popular open source packages in use (Asterisk, FreeSWITCH, OpenSIPS), read up on protocol SIP (SIP Illustrated is a good course, includes an annotated RFC) and get your name out there in the community (answer questions, post write ups, etc.)<p>There&#x27;s a range of work from cobbling CRUD apps together around a telephony core, to fixing core code, setting up networks, etc. Telecom has a lot of legacy and complexity, and that means there&#x27;s opportunity for people figuring it out. I&#x27;ve seen this happen: guy joins mailing list asking super newb questions. Fast forward a bit and now he&#x27;s billed out as an expert.

9878147,comment,9876745,9876745,0,0,mcherm,,,"Wow... that&#x27;s interesting.<p>I&#x27;ll summarize my take. First of all, take the article with a grain of salt. Possible issues brought up by Bart Eppenauer are being raised by the former chief counsel of Microsoft, a direct competitor to AWS (Azure). And the linked article has a somewhat alarmist phrasing.<p>That being said, there appears to be something real here. This contract is one that applies to thousands of businesses -- cloud computing is taking both small business and big business by storm, and AWS has the majority of the business in this area. The clause itself reads like this (retrieved today from <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/agreement/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aws.amazon.com/agreement/</a> ):<p><pre><code>  During and after the Term, you will not assert, nor will
  you authorize, assist, or encourage any third party to
  assert, against us or any of our affiliates, customers,
  vendors, business partners, or licensors, any patent
  infringement or other intellectual property infringement
  claim regarding any Service Offerings you have used.
</code></pre>
Now, I am not a lawyer, so my interpretation could be wrong; even if I WERE a lawyer I would be saying that nothing was certain at least until a court had ruled on a case that depended on this clause. But it appears that this clause is very broad in time (from now onwards), in scope (covers patents as well as &quot;all IP&quot;) and in targets (against Amazon OR most anyone else like their customers or business partners). The clause is restricted ONLY by the statement that it applies to a claim about &quot;Service Offerings you have used&quot;.<p>Now, my impression would be that this means you can&#x27;t sue Amazon (or their partners/customers/etc) over IP violations <i>BY THE AWS PRODUCT ITSELF</i>. In other word, if you use AWS you can&#x27;t then later sue Amazon or their customers saying that AWS itself violates your patent on using a computer remotely (or whatever ridiculous patent you may hold). With this interpretation it is an extremely reasonable provision and should not concern any company involved in normal business.<p>Furthermore, the one case where Amazon has asserted this clause (against Appistry)[1] fit this model. Appistry sued Amazon saying that Amazon violated its patent; Amazon countered that Appistry was using AWS and with this clause had agreed not to sue. That case is still underway.<p>So my evaluation is that this is <i>probably</i> an OK clause. But it certainly skirts the line and you ought to have your lawyer look it over. After that, you will probably ignore what your lawyer says and sign it anyway because Amazon is the giant of cloud computing and you don&#x27;t have a whole lot of choice.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.geekwire.com/2015/amazon-fights-patent-suit-using-little-noticed-clause-in-standard-aws-customer-agreement/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geekwire.com/2015/amazon-fights-patent-suit-using...</a>",1436796698

Our ability to engineer things is dramatically improved by applying the knowledge, techniques, and processes provided by science. But it&#x27;s not the only way.<p>I feel the article dances around what the fundamental purpose of engineering is - that is to create viable real-world objects by solving problems of constraints and tradeoffs. Nearly all meaningful engineering problems can be posed as a series of constraints and tradeoffs. Even if you were out trying to sharpen a stick into a spear, you&#x27;re intuitively (and probably iteratively) solving the problem of constraints and tradeoffs.<p>When you set out the make the spear, you might not even know the full extent of the problem. You know that at a high level the spear (assume a throwing spear) must be long enough to be stable in flight, short enough to not be a burden, heavy enough to fly well and deliver energy on impact, light enough to throw, thin though to grip easily, but thick enough to not shatter on impact, pointy enough to inflict damage, but not too pointy for the point to be too fragile.<p>You now get to solve this problem. Sometimes as an engineer you might get the exact values of these constraints given to you, sometimes you have to go find them, and sometimes you wing it. You can use science (work from material properties, dynamics, deformation, biomechanics), you can use some &#x27;direct empirical evidence&#x27; (screw around and guess and check =D ) and iterate through a bunch of spear designs, or some rules of thumbs that your uncle told you or a mix of all.<p>The most important thing is that you are managing trade-offs and constraints at some level.",1436796410

Debt to GDP ignores this difference. Comparing debt to tax revenue reveals a much truer picture of the burden of each country’s debt on its government’s finances.</i><p><i>When I compute those figures, Japan is still #1, with a debt as a percentage of tax revenue of about 900 percent and Greece is still in second place at about 475 percent.

348310,comment,348164,348276,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>I assume that even without actually hiring someone to replace you directly, you could differentiate between salary & dividends. Then you continue to pay the salary to the remaining founder & any replacing employee & split the dividends. I guess the remaining founder would receive gradual increase to his equity share as part of his package.</i><p>Yep.  That would probably cover it.  Though, my thinking in this case is that in a partnership of two people, if one leaves it's probably going to hurt the company in the short term.  There's just a lot of loose ends to tie up...and as others have mentioned, being free of the whole thing may be more valuable (because let's face it, a 100k annual revenue
 company isn't going to make him rich--unless it grows dramatically, which would generally mean the other found did some kick ass work without the other holding him back).  If he's feeling the urge to do something completely different, there's a lot of good arguments for doing just that.<p><i>BTW, wouldn't most vesting schedules have already left this founder with quote a bit of equity (2.5 years)?</i><p>Yes.  And a board seat and the responsibilities that go along with that.<p>But, every case is different.  Nobody here can tell someone else what will make them happy.",1225331031

<i>""I wouldn't release E or anything like it, even in purely virtual environments, without engineered safeguards,"" Bringsjord says.

348300,comment,347687,347799,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Well for someone wanting to prototype something, it might be a lot cheaper to buy one of these than buy the equipment needed to create a prototype out of wood.<p>I mean the fact that it can make a cylinder is great. I mean the only good thing about prototyping with wood is that a wood lathe is relatively cheap due to them existing for centuries.<p>Buying a small wood lathe and chisels would be relatively cheaper than this 3D printer, but it would take a lot more skill and talent to create some of the models you can see on the shapeways site.<p>I would like to know what temperature some of the 3D modelling materials melt at as it would make it easy to use for casting of metal models. I mean if the stuff melts at 100 degrees, you could just build the cast and melt the plastic out just like using wax. If this was possible, it's just easy to imagine the uses for turning a good prototype into a final product. It's like if you design a good model, just build the cast pour in the metal and there's something to sell. Like if you get this on a large scale imagine what could be done for a cast-iron furniture business. Instead of hours spent sculpting a model and then building a cast off it, you make a design and reuse it repeatedly. For the convenience of printing out the model it would save a lot of time and to say I saw a simple (very simple) cast-iron gate selling for around $1500, you'd be able to absorb the $200 for making a new model every time.",1225330036

Forums are where I first entered the Internet, and I still look on them fondly: this essay was partially a reminiscence. Is that what you were talking about?<p>I think that individualism web appeals to vastly more people than collectivism does. I'd guess that there's ample room for both online. Most people use the Internet for recreation primarily, though, and most people don't want to recreate beyond the small-talk level.<p>I remember telling friends about Zoints: this was before I even had a MySpace account. I would excitedly show them how many web pages I had and how many more I could make; I showed them how you could drag-and-drop. I think the most sympathetic reaction I got was ""Oh, wow, that's neat."" A few people actually did register, but there was never anything there to keep them active.

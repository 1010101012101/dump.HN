1055228,comment,1054819,1054819,0,0,tokenadult,,,"Thanks to everyone for their interesting comments. Some of the forms of site behavior mentioned here I don't think I have ever observed. I don't read the code for the site software, so I just use the site empirically. The discussion of trade-offs involved in different kinds of site voting behavior defaults has been very helpful to me.<p>My overall perspective on any online forum's forum rules is that I just deal with them. I don't take any set of rules personally. I don't assume any kind of enforcement action or limitation on my own forum participation is directed at me as an individual, but rather is a forum management response to forum issues. If I enjoy a forum, I keep right on participating. If I don't enjoy a forum, I take my participation elsewhere without feeling offended. I happen to like HN a lot. To each their own.<p>As to specific observations of voting behavior, to the best of my knowledge and belief, when I upvote a comment or submission, and when I downvote a comment, my votes immediately change the score of the item I have just voted on. I try in my own mind to upvote more often than downvote, but I have no way to keep track of my actual count of votes up or down. I do like to clean up the comments, so I definitely downvote from time to time, and sometimes in bursts of downvotes in one thread. Unless I am wholly mistaken in my observation, my votes count as ups or downs on those items, in real time. It has been my observation that my own personal karma score will sometimes be stable for hours at a time, even if I have made new comments or submitted new articles, and it may be (I don't know) that I am running into some automated response of the site software such that my karma score is frozen if I have just been downvoting repeatedly. But it often seems that overnight, or after a while, my personal karma score becomes unstuck, and anyway I don't worry about this too much. I look at my threads view from time to time both to see if anyone has replied to any of my comments and to see what the aggregate votes are on those comments. If I am below 1 in aggregate score on some comment I have made, I try to think why readers would decide to downvote it. If I see someone else get a conspicuously high net score on a comment in a thread where I have also commented, I try to figure out what he or she did right to achieve commendation from other participants. As long as the site in general is worth reading and interesting to me, I don't especially worry about how its voting behavior is implemented. It's fun for me to learn from other participants here what kind of rules are visible in the source code and what kind of incentives may be designed by management to keep the conversation worthwhile. Since 1992, I have been a moderator on one or another of a variety of online forums, and I'm always deeply curious about what makes online communities successful and valuable to participants. I think HN is doing a good job.<p>P.S. I like many of RiderOfGiraffes's submissions and comments, and have certainly upvoted more than a few (and perhaps downvoted none of them). I too recall some thread in which pg mentioned RiderOfGiraffes favorably, although I don't have the link at hand. I would regret seeing RiderOfGiraffes leaving the site or changing his username, because I like to see familiar usernames as a clue that a comment or submission will be worth a read.",1263574571

I will be starting a new project on it, actually.  But ""stark"" and ""modern"" are relative.  While there's a lot of very pretty Python that reads like pseudocode, there's also a bit of Python that goes down the same sinful path as C header files or Perl in the use of arcane symbols.  There's no reason why things like meta-programming have to look like anything different from plain old programming.<p>That said, I think Python hits a very attractive middle ground.  There is <i>just enough</i> syntax to fit the most basic cultural expectations of technical people as well as a large number of programmers.  That, if you think about it, is a stunning achievement in human-interface design.  (Read that straight-up!)<p>(And to be fair: Smalltalk - even more minimal, but ignores lots of important cultural expectations.  Lisp - even more minimal and just about everything, no matter how meta, looks like normal Lisp.  But on the downside, everything looks like normal Lisp.)",1263571691

I can think of just programming with white text on a white background, but that wouldn't serve any security related purpose.<p>From reading that, it's clear that the shellcode was obfuscated ('encrypting' it three times, though, would be unnecessary<i>), but that's just a good way to muddle things up.  Although from reading that it's obvious that it was a sophisticated attack in this day and age of cybercriminals who go for the easiest target available, nothing mentioned there hasn't been possible for almost any buffer overflow attack.  Code obfuscation has been used for years for copy protection and to prevent static reverse engineering in general, and although nonstandard in exploitation, by no means unheard of.  In my opinion a more impressive exploit would be one which used all printable ascii (which also is possible).<p>On a side note, some of the terms used are either misused or just wrong:  although the payload may have been obfuscated, 'encryption' at least to me implies separate key/decryption schemes, which don't really work well from a shellcode point of view.  You'd be better off using a static 'encryption' scheme like ROT13, but that seems more like obfuscation in this day and age, particularly since the code to deobfuscate it would have to be built in.<p>TL;DR:  I think they throw around 'encryption' in places where it doesn't make sense to use it because it makes it sound scary, and it doesn't seem like any of the techniques used were 'new' or somehow more sophisticated then what was previously possible.<p></i>For simple IDS evasion, at least, so that you aren't throwing up flags: it could've been done to make forensics much harder.",1263571532

You can get just jeans from company A, with an unknown profit margin or middlemen, or you can get jeans from company B together with information and conditions on production.<p>If these conditions were a service you were charged explicitly for, of course the company B jeans would be more expensive than the ones from company A. That’s not necessarily the case, however, since there might be unknown expenses for the consumer involved with company A (like, say, higher profit margins).<p>Or, for that matter, the jeans from company A could be every bit as “fairly” produced, just you don’t know about it.

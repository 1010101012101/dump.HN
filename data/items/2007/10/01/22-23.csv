Each has its strengths and weaknesses but they are both pleasant language to write things in. Developer time is worth more than CPU time but I think that Python and Ruby would have to be at about the same level in terms of developer productivity (I use both Python and Ruby but I use Python a lot more than Ruby so maybe there is some Ruby magic that I'm not aware of that would make it MUCH more productive).",1191276865

If you can add the link it to the demo page. <p>Had play with it and it does work and made a sort of messy myspace inspired page. Couple of things I found.<p>- it wasn't obvious you needed widgets to type stuff in but once I found ""options"" it was<p>- background + profile image upload worked fine<p>- text resizing ok but as you increased the size to say 72pt the edit outline \nstayed at old size<p>- no problems moving controls around screen but noticeable delay (but not unworkable)<p>- worked as advertised but a bit slow but not too slow.<p>- thought I would have needed grids so I could nicely lay stuff out but realised this really not needed.<p>One question on style. Why have you chosen to have Ajax style edit dialog and not say a plain html page on a separate url? I'm noticing this on lots of sites (for me it's a pain  but livable) why is it chosen?  <p>Another Q? How do you make a hyperlink?  <p>\n<i>A bit later ...</i><p>Had some trouble with the login on the homepage.

It's not that Skype didn't find a way to make money and became a failure despite of it's uesr base. The problem is simply that Ebay paid way more than Skype was worth. $90 million in annual revenues is a decent amount of money and at a lower price it would have been a good investment.",1191276008

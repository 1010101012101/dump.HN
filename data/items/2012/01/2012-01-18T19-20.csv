I used to pirate every version of Windows I owned, back in the days of Windows 98 and up to Windows XP it was a breeze. Starting around Windows XP SP3, it got a bit more difficult. It was easy to pirate, but after a few weeks/months of use, you get the Genuine Advantage warning. With Windows 7, it is even worse. So I decided to purchase my first legitimate copy of Windows. I haven't looked back. It is so much easier and I don't waste my time re-cracking my Windows installation every month. It is well worth the price. Since then I have also acquired a legitimate version of Office 2010, even though I got it heavily discounted for students, back in the Windows XP days, I would have laughed at the thought of buying $100+ software.<p>And anytime I upgrade hardware or even want to move my install to another computer, the activation is so fast and easy.

3481531,comment,3480635,3480635,28,0,dxbydt,,,">> ""When information is organized in a list, its trivially easy to scan it, but with Timeline your eye has to dart around and try to combine the layout into an understanding of what the persons been up to. It induces cognitive strain""<p>Well, the whole idea is to engage the user. They hang around a lot more when they engage. If you give somebody a list they will trivially take the head the second time onwards ( they will pop the stack, for any imperative folks out there ). That's because the very first time, you actually traverse the list. From then on, the head tells you if the list has mutated. So your brain will save you the cognitive load by simply taking the head of the list and then saying to you, look, there is no need to engage further since there hasn't been any destructive update since the last time you looked. So you will log off.<p>To prevent disengagement, all creative media ( magazines, newspapers, movies, comics, TV etc. ) will assault you on multiple fronts. So you don't get a list anymore. So Time magazine will have multiple columns on the same page, with each column corresponding to a different topic. One of those columns will have a picture, another an ad, the third an infographic, the fourth some text, and so on. I took a bunch of semesters of screenplay writing where this stuff is actually taught in some gory detail - how to keep the viewer hooked. Never be linear - the viewer is smart and will simply (and often correctly) guess where the movie is headed. So confuse the viewer by presenting information in a non-linear fashion deliberately, and occasionally throw interesting but unrelated bits of filler/second unit stock footage into the plot. Spice things up. I believe it was the british who came up with the more accurate term ""sex it up"".
That's what facebok is doing. 
Frankly, it works very well - for the non-programmer types. Lets be clear, your life isn't all that interesting. If I just show you status updates in a list, you will be bored stiff after a point. But if I introduce a tiny element of stochastic displacement in your timeline, you will wonder, hey, where did this come from , when did I do that, etc. That'll keep you engaged, and that translates to a longer duration on the site => more $$",1326916421
3481530,comment,3481077,3481296,3,0,Turing_Machine,,,"Testing is the wrong approach, IMO. It's, at best, a proxy for actual knowledge, and suffers from the inherent problems of all proxy measures (the same is true for grades -- if a class is worth taking, there's way too much material to boil it down to a single letter). We've used tests and grades in the past because we had no better option, but that's no longer the case.<p>The web lets us assemble large-scale portfolios of our actual work and transmit them to potential employers with a link. As an employer, would you rather see:<p>a) A transcript showing that the person got an A in his CS senior design project (or got some specified score on a test).
b) A link to github which lets you see the actual code that the person wrote for the project.<p>I know which one I'd rather see.<p>There's no real reason why a student couldn't deposit <i>all</i> of his work in an archive (with perhaps some sort of vetting/certification by the professor or institution), then grant access to the archive (or selected parts of the archive) to potential employers.",1326916410

3481491,comment,3480667,3481336,4,0,chc,,,"> <i>The evidence speaks: it was clearly an extreme and urgent problem to some parties, hence the act is under serious consideration.</i><p>This is a non sequitur. The fact that something is under consideration does not mean it addresses an ""extreme and urgent problem"". For example, the Gravina Island Highway (the ""road to nowhere"") was not only under serious consideration, but was actually built despite the fact that it did nobody any good. And we've all heard about silly laws, like how it's illegal to tease skunks in Minnesota. Do you think skunk-teasing is an extreme and urgent problem?<p>The fact that an industry group is pushing a bill that would give it massive power does not indicate that there is actually an urgent problem that needs solving, much less that the bill is what's necessary to solve their problem. I mean, if somebody offered me a million dollars, I'd absolutely take it, but you would be wrong to infer that I'm a million dollars in debt. In this particular case, many of the numbers the industry associations have thrown out to show a need have been proven to be outright fabrications, and most of the others have been shown to be heavily skewed. So not only have they not shown a legitimate need, but they've demonstrated that their motive has nothing to do with need.<p>Now, don't get me wrong: I'm not saying that piracy isn't a problem  just that I don't see a need for drastic measures.<p>> <i>Shoplifting is not only illegal, but much is dedicated to minimizing it.</i><p>The <i>maximum</i> sentence for shoplifting in most places is one year in jail. We're hardly taking SOPA-level countermeasures against it.<p>> <i>To claim that SOPA is similar to a death sentence for shoplifting is excessive hyperbole.</i><p>I don't think so. Jailing people for song covers on YouTube is about as disproportionate, and SOPA essentially implements the death penalty for websites that don't have the resources to police user-generated content with 100% efficacy. But at any rate, the point of the comparison is that it is a <i>drastic</i> solution to a vexing but not-so-drastic problem.",1326916036

Unless you are trying to make the claim that the set of the smartest people in tech is a proper subset of the employees of Google (or Google employees unioned with Facebook employees). I think lots and lots of very smart people that don't work for Google or Facebook would strongly disagree, and evidence is on their side.<p>>lots and lots of very smart people are channelling their efforts into getting people to click on ads.<p>Yes, but lots and lots of very smart people are also doing <insert other kind of tech venture here>. The statement seems to pre-suppose that there is no or little value in the work they do and they should be working on more 'valuable' problems.<p>I personally hate advertising, but I don't look down on people that work at Google or Facebook if their job involves increasing click-through rates, nor do I believe having smart people focused on these kind of tasks is 'holding us back' in any meaningful way. To believe so implies that 'smart people' can excel/advance the state of the art for <i>anything</i> they work on, and thus they should focus on more 'important' things. If these smart people were <i>attracted</i> to doing these more important things that may be true, but then they would probably be doing them already. If they are attracted to what they are doing then they should continue, and do it as best they can. Further it ignores the idea that there are side-effects of their work that could be more valuable to the world as a whole (like new discoveries in machine learning, or algorithms, or even human psychology).<p>The fundamental currency that buys advancement is intelligence, creativity and passion for what you are doing. If you have 2 out of 3 you are unlikely to contribute meaningfully, and simply reassigning everyone at Google to work on say self-driving cars is unlikely to yield reliable, self-driving cars any faster, in fact it would likely cripple the effort.",1326915856

3481308,comment,3478850,3480972,1,0,dhimes,,,"Would you replace copyright with ""terms of use"" or something in a contract with the performer?<p>I see the value of copyright (or other intellectual property protection, such as the ""terms of use"" I mentioned above) in this case, for two reasons.<p>First, the value for the creative doesn't scale.  Suppose a conductor commissioned some music to be written for six summer evening performances.  How should the music writer value the work to be written?  The negotiations would probably consider how much revenue the performances will generate, and result in a (presumably) fair compensation for the writer.<p>But suppose the conductor, after the piece has been written, uses the it for eight performances?  Or switches to a much larger venue that generates much more revenue?  If you don't allow for a way for the writer to be fairly compensated you run the risk of not being able to attract good writers to the field.  We could argue that geniuses and top talent would still be there, but it would be difficult for merely talented to make a living (or for the unknown to start out).<p>The second reason I see is to protect the reputation of the writer.  John Williams is a brilliant composer who has written some of the best and most-recognizable movie themes.  He wrote, for instance, the theme for the movie ""Jaws.""<p>Suppose someone took his music and used it as a soundtrack for a movie that he found very distasteful (a porno, or a movie advocating the rise of the Aryan Nation, for example).  He would then be associated with these other ideas, even against his will.  You could argue that his ability to use music to conjure emotions could be used to rally people for causes with which he vehemently disagrees.  Copyright can help protect against that (but can't completely stop it, of course).",1326913950

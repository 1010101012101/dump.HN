6236941,comment,6236478,6236855,20,0,cnorgate,,,"Totally agree with Zeteo&#x27;s assessment - only thing I would add is that people shouldn&#x27;t assume someone else&#x27;e job is &#x27;bullshit&#x27; simply because they can&#x27;t directly see or appreciate the value it creates.<p>For example: in the case of corporate leadership, it is easy and appealing to suggest they aren&#x27;t creating any direct value... i.e. fire the leadership and &#x27;widgets&#x27; will still get made. The problem with this thinking is that the output from some individuals only shows up in the medium to long term... take away great leadership from a company and they will make the numbers for the next few quarters, but in a year they will be out-maneuvered and out-performed by the competition. In today&#x27;s economy it&#x27;s not about how many widgets you make, it&#x27;s about making the right widget in the first place... figuring that out is a lot harder than actually making the thing in the end.<p>The value some jobs create is more difficult to view directly, but is no less valuable in terms of delivering things people want, that they are willing to pay for - i.e. creating wealth. Investors understand this very well, which is why they are willing to pay huge sums to top leadership.<p>As a final thought, if you really want to &#x27;reap the benefits&#x27; or our more productive society, you can work 15 hours starting today. The tradeoff is that you&#x27;ll need to move to the middle of Colorado, buy a small plot of land, build your own house and purchase a straight edge razor. If you want to enjoy the vast benefits (however small) that our progressive society enjoys, then you also need to live within that system and work in some way to push things forward... however incrementally.",1376917191

6236931,comment,6236478,6236478,2,0,ap22213,,,"Part of the problem is that it&#x27;s really hard to quantify the social value of failure.  So, a lot of people opt to take the easy path and do more busy work.  At least, then they may show that their busy work had some productivity and output.<p>I see this all too often in software development.  Instead of people chasing wildly challenging ideas, they choose to re-write things over and over.  How many programming languages do we really need?  How many ORMs and MVC frameworks?  How many template engines?  Do we really need to port all of those libraries to yet another platform?<p>It seems its socially more acceptable to chase the incremental improvements (or illusory improvements) than to chase those things that have high risk of failure.<p>Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re a musician.  Would you rather spend your life working on a entirely new genre of music that ends up never catching on?  Or, would you rather pursue the path of getting signed to a major label by churning out rehashes of previous hits?  At least the second path gives some opportunity to pay the bills while still doing something that resembles what you love.<p>As a society we need a better way of &#x27;paying&#x27; people to explore, experiment and invent.  We need better ways to capture the multitudes of failures and re-incorporate them.  I think this used to be the realm of the academic, but it seems that the academic institution has now become just a hand of the corporate machine.",1376916989

Once I got to college, I had a professor for Calculus I that said our grade was the four tests + the final or just the final - whichever grade was higher. Having taken Cal in high school, I just showed up for the final and got a B+ (I reversed the damn derivatives of ln/e).<p>That was the best math class I never took. To be fair, my discipline wasn&#x27;t anything scientific so needing math wasn&#x27;t in my college curriculum (switched from business to psychology then to art and advertising). I took another class, Discrete Math, from the same teacher my senior year as an elective and absolutely loved it. I never skipped a day.<p>He was a great teacher, and the way his class was set up for grading and not really giving a shit about homework was perfect.

6236882,comment,6235394,6235669,5,0,ghc,,,"Let me preface this by saying that when I was 19 and <i>Hackers and Painters</i> was just published, there was no book more subversive to the natural order of things. H&P changed my life so completely that less than a year after reading it I was standing in the YC office in Mountain View for a YC interview.<p>And even after subsequent rejection, deciding to change majors to CS, going back to school to seek of the advice of Olin Shivers, and actually getting a CS degree, I practically kept it by my bedside. There was nothing even close to as influential in my decision to move to Cambridge and get reinvolved with startups as soon as I graduated.<p>But while H&P is is great at showing people like me that you can succeed in business without an MBA, and in fact might be at an advantage, it might be <i>too</i> subversive in that sense as well. Later essays that weren&#x27;t included in H&P tell a clearer story. <i>Black Swan Farming</i> and <i>What We Look For In Founder</i> and <i>Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas</i> are essays that might have affected my thinking back then.<p>I don&#x27;t think anything could have changed my path away from startups; any book containing <i>Why Nerds Are Unpopular</i> and <i>How to Make Wealth</i> was destined to have a profound affect on my life. But while VC is somewhat demonized and stories are told about running out of money, I think there is a certain glorification of the process that
 translated in my brain to &quot;build product -> seek seed funding (YC) -> get users -> get VC&quot;, when I might have been better served by something telling me in big, bold l

The phenomenon is more elegantly explained by pure economics: as less time is expended extracting resources and producing things, more energy is absorbed by the zero-sum, gimmicky game of selling and marketing them.<p>To give credit where it&#x27;s due, I first saw this credible argument on michaelochurch&#x27;s (now sadly inactive) blog [1], and he may well have originated it. Here it is, in a better explanation than I could provide:<p>&quot;The Marketing and Sales Treadmill<p>In the modern world [...] there are no unexploited resources and no surplus jobs to be had processing those resources. [The worker] needs a job, but their labor is surplus and unnecessary.<p>[...T]he most common path is that our prospective worker enters the sales and marketing business. [...]  Even engineering focused companies like Facebook have more sales people than engineers. [...] So everyones energy is focused on imagining some gimmick  a six bladed razor, a beer can that turns blue when [it&#x27;s] cold, a funny talking gecko  that gives someone a reason to give you money when there is no real differentiation based on product value.<p>The sales and marketing economy is zero sum. Each business must work harder and harder at new tag lines, gizmos, tricks, and jingles. And when sales guys at the other company work harder, you must work harder too.<p>Past writers who imagined the future thought that as machines saved our time, we would have more time for leisure. That has not happened. Instead [...] we must work in sales and marketing to convince someone with money to trade cash for our trinket, so that we can have purchasing power to access the natural bounty of the land. [...] The future is here, and it is the sales desk at Dunder Mifflin.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://intellectual-detox.com/2013/04/14/rent-seeking-economy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intellectual-detox.com/2013/04/14/rent-seeking-econom...</a>",1376915726

I actually view the mind as a total algorithm, because there are a shocking number of personality traits that <i>appear</i> to be deterministic[1]. Thus, I don&#x27;t actually believe in free will, but I find it to be a useful <i>model</i> by which to live by (kinda like how classical mechanics helped us get to the moon despite relativity ultimately being more accurate). There are many things that can still work within a deterministic system though, they may just require the right set of inputs[2] to get the desired outputs. So I just proposed a perspective (one that leverages our apparently limitless ability for plasticity and memory) as an input, and maybe it&#x27;ll trigger some people to <i>deterministically</i> consider it for helping themselves, leading to useful outputs.<p>The system is much too complex to assume that just because we don&#x27;t have what amounts to total &#x27;free&#x27; will that we&#x27;re hopeless to improve anything at our level of operation. If someone&#x27;s determined (pun intended) to be a defeatist, then alright, but some others are just waiting for the right inputs to take them down a more useful branch of execution. Because just like a program, even though everything is neatly outlined and determined, that doesn&#x27;t mean you know what every output ever will be. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t think &#x27;hardcore&#x27; determinism to the point of discouraging choices is a useful view to take, much like how hardcore philosophical skepticism is a dead-end line of logic; neither really provide anything you can build off of, so while they may ultimately be true, they&#x27;re poor models for productivity. I mean, it&#x27;s possible that you&#x27;re right and I&#x27;m just having a hard case of cognitive dissonance, but it seems to me like extrapolating deterministic genetic algorithms to argue against useful high-level perspectives is still making a lot of assumptions about the implications of such a system. Meanwhile, I&#x27;m just reporting observations that been found with regards to skill acquisition.<p>[1] The phenomenon depicted on this episode of Radiolab with regards to Transient Global Amnesia is particularly damning (<a href=""http://www.radiolab.org/2011/oct/04/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.radiolab.org/2011/oct/04/</a> ), because it shows that when given all the same inputs, you&#x27;re likely to perform the exact same actions over-and-over again. The separated twin studies on IQ also show a remarkable number of personality similarities amongst twins (besides IQ), which indicates a possible genetic component to random things like sense of humor. There&#x27;s no hard evidence that any of these things <i>are</i> genetically determined of course, but meh. Let&#x27;s also not forget that epigenetics and GMOs exist, though it may be a while before that becomes useful for GATTACA-like situations, lol.<p>[2] Yes, genetics and other deterministic factors count as inputs. If you want to reach a branch of logic that requires AND-ing with a genetic component you don&#x27;t have, then tough luck, but a simple OR with some other less deterministic input is equally possible. Of course, this is just another hypothetical model to cope with our lack of understanding.",1376914495

The initial questions were simple, factual, and related to the felony.  But then the questions changed.  At a certain point the questions became <i>almost</i> accusatory, at which point I started to ask WTF.  It was then - and only then - that I was told I was a suspect and read my Miranda Rights.  As knowledgeable as I was about my rights in my own country, all this still left dumbfounded.  (It turned out the suspect in the felony had subsequently accused me and a colleague of a different felony.  For months we were still suspects, had our own rights limited and were interrogated frequently.  Thankfully, evidence came to light several months later that firmly cleared me and my colleague.)<p>I can not imagine being in a foreign country and going through a comparable situation.

For example, if you want to get a green fluorescent protein into cancer cells you currently have to use BACs (bacterial artificial chromosomes) which carry that gene into the cell. HACs are relatively novel and can carry much larger genes and are also stable over mitosis (that is, all offspring carries the gene).<p>Currently, HACs are not very feasible due to a couple of hurdles, all of which this project tries to overcome (which is why it sounds so generic - like all good project description it tries to catch all possible outcomes).<p>This has great implications in gene therapy!

It&#x27;s the easiest route. There are two options:<p>* There&#x27;s the EB-5. You could establish a subsidiary of your foreign parent company in the US using this visa, or even start fresh new company with it. It requires that you invest $1 million ($500k in some cases), create (or &quot;preserve&quot;) 10 jobs for <i>American citizens or greencard holders</i> by the end of the first year (that you&#x27;re in the US). There are probably other requirements. You can look it up. For more info: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EB-5_visa"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EB-5_visa</a> Unless you have $1 million+ and a solid business plan lying around, this isn&#x27;t really an option.<p>* The other option is the L-1A and EB-1C for mutinational executives and managers. This can also be used to establish a subsidiary in the US. Assuming you are the owner/CEO of your company, I would imagine it being subject to more scrutiny (stringent requirements). Generally though, I would assume the primary test would be in terms of how &quot;big&quot; your company is (in terms of revenue, number of employees, etc.)<p>Warning: IANAL. This is just knowledge I&#x27;ve picked up here and there. You should really look research this though. Generally though, the US doesn&#x27;t want individuals &quot;self-immigrating&quot; -- that&#x27;s why there are so many laws and guards it. Think of it this way: if you could immigrate to the US via your startup (say you spent $300k on your startup), then how many more people (non-startuppers) would try to imitate and do that? There are millionaires who would love to move to the US but can&#x27;t due to the immigration system there.<p>If you don&#x27;t mind a slightly conservative culture, and would like to avoid paying taxes -- you can check out the various emirates of the UAE. You could move to the UAE, and not have to pay the (from what I hear) 40% taxes in Europe. If the tax is 40%, no tax means a <i>66%</i> rise in actual after-tax income. :-) The UAE has laws specifically set up for foreigners to come in and start businesses in the country. It&#x27;s extremely start-up (and freelance consultant) friendly. You generally apply through a &quot;free zone authority&quot;. FWIW Dubai is probably one of the most modern cities in the world.

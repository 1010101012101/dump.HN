Not the salary per se, but the very caustic obsession on short/medium term profit over long term. You can't really blame regulations here: the most important one was forcing companies to disclose CEO salaries 20 years ago, and we know how that turned out (they exploded because of competition).<p>I'm very much in favor of Rand's ideas, but we must admit they do require a rather hard to find mix of idealism and dedication for all parties involved in order to work out.

544229,comment,543865,544209,0,0,unalone,,,"Ugh, such a gross misinterpretation. One of Rand's big points is that it doesn't matter what you're doing as long as you do it well. One of her physicists becomes a janitor, and when the misguided protagonist expresses horror at that, he says that there's nothing wrong in doing menial tasks.<p>Bob is incredibly stupid because he makes fun of something that Rand <i>expressly</i> says is a good thing. Furthermore, the Rearden parody (""I only know how to pay people to invent alloys"") ignores that in the book, Rearden is the scientist who invents the alloy himself. He's portrayed as a very skilled mathematician. So it's a good parody IF you're okay with laughing at something that Rand never actually wrote.",1238715303

If they have 300 applicants and 10 slots, how do you think it'd work if they said, ""take your time, let us know whenever"".  If they accept you, they aren't accepting the next startup on their list...

The seed funding business is national, not regional.” and we know that in fact it is international as UK teams have taken part. In fact as far as I know, all the YC-like schemes will consider international applicants.<p>However, as jlees says, that does not benefit the UK. I believe that a lot of it is to do with national culture differences - the US just has a much stronger ethos of innovation and investment. People are just more likely to be entrepreneurial in the US. Entrepreneurs built America and it’s been part of their culture since colonists first settled there.<p>Meanwhile, in the UK, most individuals with large amounts of money (enough for angel investing) are either “old money” or have gained their money through conventional high-paying jobs (lawyers, investment bankers) where entrepreneurship is not part of the job per se. Those that do try angel investing, just don’t quite “get it”. Technology is completely alien to some farmer with 100,000 acres who happens to have a spare £100,000, meanwhile biotech investments (my current sector) will scare the bejesus out of most sane angels.<p>I would love to start a UK YC equivalent, but I would not want to do it without having experienced considerable success through starting and exiting some companies, or through gaining significant experience through VC work (which is closer to my current job). If anything, these experiences are needed just to build the network which we know is more important than the money in these programmes.<p>As has been mentioned, there are some schemes around in the UK, but there is nothing that /really/ fills YC’s concept-PoC niche. There will be eventually though - once I have got a spare £100 M from successfully selling a few companies I will gladly start one!",1238713460

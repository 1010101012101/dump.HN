M&A opportunities outside the core business are especially hard to integrate in the software sector.

Buying up smaller companies in that field doesn&#x27;t provide a lot of help in cracking FB&#x27;s castle.<p>OTOH, Apple and Google are outcompeting each other in mobile - no other company is currently making big inroads, not even MS, even though they see it as a critical playing field for their future.<p>And why would one of the big tech giants buy out old-economy companies (eg. in automotive) if they believe disrupting that field with innovation is much more likely to succeed?<p>In the end, the international financial system let&#x27;s them get away with hoarding and shuffling around the billions and the companies don&#x27;t see killer investment opportunities.

10945917,comment,10945426,10945426,0,0,kom107,,,"As someone with 10+ years of mad success in sales/marketing/hacking growth, from my own startup to Fortune 500 level in several verticals, here&#x27;s what you have to do:<p>1. Yeah, sometimes you just gotta cold call.  Even better, show up.  Ever watch the original Wall Street? Bud Fox calls Gekko every damn day.  To get in front of your very first customers, you need to be doing this too.  Go to where your ideal customers are and start talking with them (tangentially) about your product.<p>2. MAJOR CAVEAT: This first conversation should NOT be about you, product features, design, how much VC you&#x27;ve landed (or want to land).  No &#x27;push notifications&#x27; here guys.  You should be listening to your customer, asking them about what problems you THINK they have that you THINK your product will solve.  If it&#x27;s not the type of product to obviously solve a problem (maybe you&#x27;ve not figured out what problem it solves or it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s more for fun), let the customer play with it and ask the customer high-value questions while they use it.<p>3. Here&#x27;s the secret to successful sales in one sentence: it&#x27;s not at ALL about you or the product.  Remember that, listen, and your customers will start giving clues away about how to sell to them.  If you get good at asking the right questions, it&#x27;s like calling the Nintendo cheat hotline back in the day: the wins come really easily once someone tells you how to do it (I&#x27;d like to publicly apologize to my parents for the 1998 phone bill right now).<p>4. Always, always, always track the conversations.  Every one.  Even that 2 second one getting coffee this morning.  Look for patterns (what worked, what didn&#x27;t, similarities between cohorts at different stages in the buying cycle, what questions you asked that elicited the most helpful responses, etc).  As Paul Graham says, to get your first users, you have to do things that don&#x27;t scale.  However, assuming you do this successfully, you&#x27;ll need to rapidly build systems that do scale, so doing this extra work now will pay off like mad.  Moreover, these conversations should help you find opportunities for the next iterations of your product.  In the book Traction, the authors talk about doing sales and product iteration concurrently, and they&#x27;re 100% right.  If you do one without the other, you&#x27;re going to struggle.<p>5. BE where your customers are.  Remember when you had the hots for someone in high school?  What would you do?  Everyone, and I mean everyone, tries to put themselves near where this person is--maybe you sit nearby in class, or try to pass them in the hall, whatever.  Same stuff with landing customers.  Pretend like they&#x27;re your crush, find out everything you can about their industry, their job (what they REALLY do and worry about, not just their title and organization), maybe some things they enjoy.  It&#x27;s okay to be a little creepy when prepping and strategizing sales--more info is better, because it helps you develop a more holistic picture of your ideal customer, and that narrows down the channels you should try to succeed.  Just don&#x27;t be obvious about your prep.  Remember: the will to win is important, but the will to prepare is vital.<p>6. Sales come from emotion.  One of the biggest problems I see when engineers sell is that they use language that makes sense to them and is technically correct, but makes the customers feel stupid.  Metadata to you is a &#x27;wikipedia for your most important software&#x27; to the lay person.  Make sure you emphasize the BENEFITS to the potential customer--they don&#x27;t actually care about the feature.  If you have a sciences background, you will probably screw this up.  That&#x27;s okay, just keep working at it--if you are cognizant of this and work to correct it, you&#x27;ll be doing sales like the sales pros in short order.<p>This is definitely not inclusive, and each bullet point deserves its own book, but in my experience, they&#x27;ll deliver the most value for where you are at now.  Write letters, send emails, show up early and late, go to where they are, and keep the conversations about THEM.  Sales are based on trust and likability (and it helps, but isn&#x27;t necessary, to have a best-in-class product).  You can do it.<p>It&#x27;s funny you ask this, because I&#x27;m trying to find a job leading sales/marketing/growth at a startup company (Series A or after) right now (started applying hard yesterday).  Email me and I&#x27;ll do a no-fee consult (email&#x27;s in my profile); if anyone else in the community has questions, feel free to reach out as well.  Even if you&#x27;re not in my target company demographic, I believe in good karma.  Good luck guys.",1453390988

Adding another layer of abstraction cannot reduce complexity, although it might make certain tasks <i>easier</i>. Consider assembly vs C as an example: C can make lots of programming tasks way easier, but the complexity of the system is not reduced.<p>With C, this becomes apparent when the program segfaults. A garbage-collected language or Rust can prevent segfaults using a subsystem to manage and/or enforce memory ownership, again making lots of tasks easier, while adding even more complexity.<p>In the case of transpile-to-JS languages, these can fix many of the shortcomings of JS and make lots of tasks easier, but they are a more complex system which can cause additional work if the generated code fails at run time, and the browser debugger brings up something completely different from your source code.<p>Your point that we will see more transpiled languages in the future makes sense.",1453390846

If they didn&#x27;t then it will check to see if they posted it on their personal website. Still couldn&#x27;t find it? It will then check where they work and check their work address.

If a year ago a company raised $10m at a $50m valuation, but now they want another $50m to scale, they&#x27;ll have to give up a much bigger percentage of stock to do that, which can essentially wipe out any employee stock (founders likely have a different class of stock that isn&#x27;t as affected).<p>And along the same lines, maybe the company can&#x27;t raise as much cash as they want/need.  In this case, they have to cut back on what they pay employees.  In these cases, the money starts to tighten up, and people don&#x27;t see the reason to stick around SV paying $4k/mo in rent if they&#x27;re only being paid $8k (before taxes), so they start to look for other places to go.  This can lead to a spiral where an otherwise good company can&#x27;t retain or attract talent, and so the cycle continues (don&#x27;t hit growth targets, can&#x27;t raise money at good rates, etc)",1453389495

Subscription management and caching are solvable problems too (esp. if you refrain from doing subscriptions during routing, but instead declare your dependencies where you are really are dependent on your data: in the UI components).<p>What’s the problem with using NPM packages inside Meteor, exactly?

So taxes are already extremely high.<p>At least on the federal level, about a quarter is spent on Social Security (income transfer), another quarter is spent on healthcare (mostly Medicare, with some Medicaid) and another fifth goes to defense / warfare: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget</a>.<p>U.S. tax mostly goes to transfer payments and defense / warfare. Whether that is a good thing is debatable; personally, I&#x27;d like to see more innovation and less warfare/welfare (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Launching-Innovation-Renaissance-Bring-Market-ebook/dp/B006C1HX24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Launching-Innovation-Renaissance-Bring...</a>), but by pretty much any reasonable standard the U.S. already pays lots of tax.",1453388479

Researching this now (read: googling for sources that seem legitimate), that seems to still be widely accepted.<p>However, I have never read anything that suggests that photon collisions would lead to annihilation. Is there a reason such might be the case for {anti-,}neutrinos?",1453388462

Just the sense of not belonging by virtue of being the one who clearly isn&#x27;t like the others. Imagine yourself trying to work in a software studio in an arab country. Everyone is way darker than you, just, everyone, at work, on the street, and so on. They talk about different TV shows and they frown on anything bacon, and they wear these odd dresses you never feel comfy in because you like your jeans.\nThey&#x27;re louder than you, they tend to argue way more, because it&#x27;s just part of the culture to do that, and it makes you uncomfortable. And also, you keep hearing about these white Christian terrorists, that look like you, that they wish would just get shot.",1453388413

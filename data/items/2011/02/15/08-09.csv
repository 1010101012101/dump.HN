Immigrant fruit pickers, waitresses, WalMart greeters. I'd question whether they get what they want in life. Of course they may have other goals than material gain, but hard work won't make them materially rich.<p>Success requires three basic ingredients. Luck - right place and time, being born into the right country, right family and so on and so forth. In other words, the hand you get dealt in life, which you don't have influence over. Brains - not necessarily education, but wit, quick thinking, ""emotional intelligence"" and so on, the ability to think for yourself and apply what you know to real-world problems.<p>Finally, yes, hard work, but only if applied with luck and brains.<p>As Jean-Paul Getty said, ""Formula for success: Rise early, work hard, strike oil.""",1297760320

But there's obviously brilliant people at Nokia, just like there were brilliant people at Apple before Steve Jobs.<p>Now, if Apple had ditched MacOS when Steve returned instead of using NextStep, and instead went with Windows, and shipped a WP7 phone instead of a phone with OSX, where would they be today? They _might_ have had the iTunes ecosystem, if Microsoft would have allowed it. Their ""differentiating features"" would be at the mercy of Microsoft and their strategic plans.<p>I guess people are right that you need an app ecosystem to compete in the smartphone market today.

Hence, if they are expensive, they will get competition from within their own network.<p>Contrast this with the network monopolies in the US where every (both!) carrier can just make up prices and there is nothing any customer can do about it. This is most certainly why prices are so high in the US and why carriers see little incentive to upgrade their infrastructure.",1297757283

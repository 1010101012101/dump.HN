8387,comment,8275,8284,0,0,zaidf,,,"From what you describe, it would be better if you guys do a merger instead of run two different companies.<p>Do a merger and figure out the split based on what each of your cofounder brings to the table. This makes more sense if your business and theirs compliment each other and are both in the startup phase.<p>Right now I sense that you are confused about what exactly you want out of this. If you are looking for a cofounder, a merger makes much more sense than equity swap which doesn't get you a cofounder.",1175562650

I believe its a multi million dollar idea that needs to be executed well. Also I think that my idea can be a platform for theirs... Everyone will win from working together. I just think that giving up 40% of a nearly finished product is big.",1175562342

How difficult would it be to create a system by which you could ""annotate"" video?: you could add tags to objects in the video that could allow viewers to link to the product page: <p>- for instance, when an actor lifts a can of coke, you could click on it, go to the coke page. \n- an actor's face could go to the wiki or imdb entry. \n- might be an interesting way to take brand awareness advertising (product placement) and make some conversions to actual purchases. <p>Add some options to hide/show these annotations, and maybe you could (unobtrusively) actually make some money off of video. Anyway, enough rambling about an unrefined idea.. just looking for feedback or thoughts or links to existing stuff like this.<p>",1175562250

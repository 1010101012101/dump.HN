The only reason the server is still in nodejs is because it's quite neat to be able to write transactions on the server-side too and by being in JS, I can just use the same client code as in the browser to do that, with very few changes. Writing just the txn engine in other languages would be very simple too. Next week I'm hoping to write some documentation for the protocol. But it's really just abstract addresses and version numbers and such. No rocket science at all - especially given that Node is single-threaded!",1331247543

Offhand, I would look for ways to get income from the venues, whose economics are simple: book bands with fans, sell booze to fans, profit. They're much more likely to spend, and to understand their own economics than bands themselves. Start your research by calling around local and regional papers as if you had a pub or something and wanted to take out your own advertising - get the rate card of old-media publications and try to guess how much it costs a venue owner to bring the public inside the door and spending money. Or again, simply ask them.<p>The more I think about it, the more I think venues are your revenue stream. Bands come and go, whereas stages tend to stay in one place :-)",1331247149

Just rename it to .svg and it plays alright. This works fine in Chrome.<p>Some notes:<p>1. I hacked this up as a holiday project. I think using SVG for presenting is a good idea because transforming, zooming, etc is apparently 'harder' or 'unnatural' in pure HTML, from an editor's perspective.<p>2. Upon clicking 'generate', the editor returns an array of frame ID's in the presentation sequence - since this is, in theory, all the information required to animate, any DOM animation framework, such as impress.js or dizz.js, can used for animating. Currently, it uses code from Sozi, an inkscape animation plugin, for this task.<p>3. The 'screenshots' of regions in the presentation path, show at the top in the strip, are taken using canvg. Since taking screenshots of the DOM is not normally possible, I had to use canvg to render the SVG on a canvas, and then crop out the region to be shown in the strip.<p>4. Ideally, I would have used fabric.js and Canvas to animate - fabric.js provides a kind of canvas DOM and Canvas renders things faster, being a bitmap buffer. Unfortunately, fabric doesn't import some elements like text from the input SVG (made by the editor), and you can't use a DOM animator with Canvas.<p>[edit: typo]",1331245346

Have you tried asking your users what they want, or telling your users what you want? I'm thinking of '8500 artists. 1200 upcoming shows. Could someone please buy us a drink?' A subscription model would be ideal but I'm not sure how you do that - although i do think that charging two quid for promotion sends the message that your service lacks value, and that you would have got many more signups if you had demanded twenty. If you can't see a subscription model, cost out an upgrade and some merch and then do a kickstarter to raise the funds.<p>What sort of values could you ad if you had money to burn? How about a full page ad in NME or Q every month promoting 3 new bands? Or a hookup with a radio station? Have you tried getting sponsorship from music instrument manufacturers/dealers?

If they want to wholesale ebooks they can do so... and they can also decline to do so if such is their desire.  If they want to use an agency model they can and can also decline to do so.<p>The publishers presumably want to sell books using the model that favors them (cf Adam Smith) and so they have chosen the agency model.<p>What very well may be anticompetitive about this situation is for all the large publishers to get together and collectively move to a model that knowingly results in higher consumer prices.  IANAL but on it's face that looks pretty bad and I'd guess based on reported emails that they've pretty clearly crossed the line on price fixing laws.<p>Presumably their defense is that the initial ""lower prices"" were loss leaders by monopolist Amazon not true market prices and there's probably some truth to this and that's probably why we'll see a non-trivial but non-blockbuster settlement in the low eight digits.",1331244271

All that was required was copyright attribution in their published work.</i><p>Which requires that the betas or at least the GM version of the OS update (all shipped to members of the developers' program) would contain the copyright attribution. So every competitor, <i>cough</i> Google <i>cough</i>, would get to know about Apple's decision to switch in advance, perhaps months in advance --maybe at the cost of an iOS developer program subscription ($99).<p>Have you noticed they didn't even use the latest map data, but those from mid-2010; I.e when they started, also in secrecy since no one heard anything of it, working on it?<p><i>If violating OSM's copyright carried the same financial risks as downloading illegal music, I suspect Apple's cost benefit analysis would have been different. An army of lawyers, a huge reserve of cash, and a weak opponent unlikely to be able to vigorously pursue legal remedies led Apple to the probably correct assumption that the benefits of violating copyright outweighed the financial risks.</i><p>So, spending money from ""a huge reserve of cash"" on a legal defense with ""an army of lawyers"" would help Apple avoid financial risks? Isn't spending money the financial risk in itself? How spending on lawyers is different from a fine? Did you imagine some huge fine merely from not adding an attribution as required? Whatever it could be, say 10 million dollars, it would still be pennies to Apple.<p>But the main problem with your logic is you haven't specified any reason for Apple to purposefully don't give attribution.<p>The theory of Apple wanting to take credit for the maps for itself, is ridiculous, because:<p>1) It's not like any consumer cares who made the mapping data.<p>2) It's not that Apple would have to pay to use the maps otherwise.<p>3) It's also not like Apple doesn't give attribution to myriads of other OS projects it uses.<p>4) It's also not like it was impossible that the maps would be recognised instantly by OSM contributors and people on the intertubes.<p>So, why exactly would Apple don't give attribution in purpose?<p>Only my theory, i.e secrecy, gives a reason.<p>[Downvoters have a better theory?

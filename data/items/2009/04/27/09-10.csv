This is brilliant, and allows bi-directional screen sharing which clients love. It's really powerful when training someone to get them to do the training instead of just showing them.<p>Connectnow is free, and it's only requirement is flash. Couldn't recommend it more.<p>This can be a problem when the users don't have flash installed, but it is rare. I keep a link to the actual installer exe (some users struggle to download flash the normal way) to send to users that can't use it.<p>I ask them to go to connectnow.acrobat.com before the presentation and if they can see the begin button they will be fine to view.<p>Not only is connectnow the best, it's free, but connectpro can scale to thousands of participants if you need it.<p>2. Others, such as copilot, vnc, glance, beam your screen, webex et al all have a huge number of issues in my experience.

581121,comment,581017,581017,0,0,avinashv,,,"Disclaimer: I go to UMich.  I can give you an honest opinion of what life is like as a student here, but know next to nothing of WashU over what grandalf has already said.<p>I'll get out the obvious out of the way: Michigan is cheaper.  It's the most expensive public school in the country, but it's public.  WashU is private; more expensive.  I assume you know this.<p>There's something to be said for Ann Arbor--it's a very unique town.  For the most part, almost the entire population of the town can sit in the Big House (the football stadium), so during the semester the town has a great young vibe.  There's plenty of students living in most areas of the town.  It's a great place to make friends.  However, you honestly have to consider the weather.  I grew up in a desert, but am fine with the blistering cold.  I'll say this though: the weather, at least from what I heard, _is_ as bad as I was told.<p>The housing system has gotten better in the 4 years I have been here.  The dining halls are now pretty awesome, and if you are able to live on Central Campus (definitely live on Central--West Quad or South Quad), you'll love it.  As a freshman, you'll probably hate living on North Campus, and will be ambivalent towards living on the Hill.  I'd highly recommend against living off-campus for at least your freshman year unless money is an issue.<p>Can't deny the school spirit.  We're not a terribly rowdy bunch, but we love our sports.  The Wolverines are known for excellent football (let it go) and ice hockey teams, and a re-emerging basketball team in terms of big sports.  Every sport imaginable gets played at the varsity level though.  Intramural sports are hugely popular as well, if you're into that.<p>As for the academics, Michigan is a solid all-round school.  It excels at engineering and certain liberal arts, and has some of the top graduate programs at the university.  You didn't specify exactly what you want to study, but there's brilliant research going on in almost every field where that is done, and you can get a piece of the action fairly easily.<p>You have to work to stand out.  Expect intro chem (for example) to be 5 or 6 sections in a 500-person lecture hall.  Other popular classes are exactly the same.  Class sizes obviously shrink the further you go, and you get some more focused time with GSI's/TA's (all big schools do this) in discussions, but to be recognized by the professors you need to go out of your way.<p>I really have absolutely no idea how other schools do this, but at Michigan you're really encouraged to take a tremendous variety of classes.  I don't know if this is something that appeals to you.  For example, you'll find many mechanical engineering students in the 300-level philosophy classes because mecheng students are required to take a sequence of humanities/social science classes up to the 300-level and philosophy happens to be popular.  Engineers very regularly get a math minor because it is encouraged given how much math you are required to take anyway.  Economics majors very often double-major because the major is small, and the rest of the requirements for the economics major can be put towards other majors.<p>I've also found, for the most part, that the advising staff here for the specific majors are spot-on.  Again, based on volume of students, you might not get someone remembering you semester-over-semester, but you'll get good advice without being judged on choices.<p>I'll assume that, given that this is HN, you're looking at CS.  Michigan's CS is not the engineering department's strong suit, but it's still a very good program as far as I know.  I have several friends doing EECS (electrical engineering and computer science), and, despite the tremendous workload, are enjoying it.<p>Remember: it's probably not wise to make a decision of this magnitude based on the ramblings of someone on a forum on the Internet.  Go to the course websites of each school and look at the syllabus for each program.  Look at what it costs to live in each city, what you like/don't like about each city etc.<p>If you make it to Michigan, good luck! I'm sure you'll have a fantastic time.  I graduate next week, otherwise I would have shown you around in the fall, but you should do fine.",1240825953

581117,comment,581050,581050,0,0,rjprins,,,"The subject of what morality exactly is has not been discussed. To keep it short, I think morality is a set of rules to keep a society functional. Therefor ""good"" morality would let a society be more functional, have no unnecessary costs, no unnecessary losses and have optimal productivity and innovation.<p>Here is a list of taboos:<p>- Religious beliefs. Not believing in God is OK, but it should be possible to freely criticize other people's beliefs.<p>- Sexual taboos. Bisexuality, swinging, S&M are all considered improper for no apparent reason. I won't dare even to hint child sexuality here.<p>- Nationalism. It is still considered perfectly normal to prefer people from your 'own' 'country' over people of another country. Tribalism is a very natural moral for obvious reasons.<p>- Political systems. Democracy is everything but perfect, but suggesting other forms of rule has not even been considered. A benevolent dictator will certainly be a lot better than a different charming elitist every 4 years.<p>- Drug use. Pot enjoys the popular vote, but XTC and other hard drugs are still very much not done. There are drugs which are inherently bad, but even most hard drugs aren't. Abuse is a symptom.<p>- Abortion (or further). Why are you not allowed to kill your own new born?<p>- Any criminal activity. These are just morals put to paper.<p>Any moral is a balance between human needs/wants and some theory about how society functions best.\nWhat really works best no one knows. It also depends on the goals. What constitutes a good society? The most productive? The one with the most happy residents?\nEvolution would say the one that survives.\nThe moral fashions in that sense would equal genetic mutations in order to find the most optimal set of rules.<p>One thing is certain though. There are no such things as   right or wrong moralities, there is only effective and ineffective moralities.",1240825527

If a lot of <i>low-quality</i> ""stories"" like this stay about, then maybe.  But the greater danger is attracting trolls / low-caliber people, not losing the current people.  The current people are here to stay.<p><i>There's obviously a lot of people who are 'pro drugs', and we've already had more than enough marijuana stories.</i><p>This is neither.  I was specifically trying to be scientific about this.  Just because I am dropping acid once does not make me pro-drug. I have seen the harm that uncontrolled use of recreational drugs can cause.  I am also agnostic to the whole debate surrounding drug use.  All I care about is the experience.  Also, thoughtless labels like ""pro-drug"" and ""anti-drug"" simply hinder progress.  The world is not black or white.<p><i>In terms of actual interestingness, I'm sure anyone who is curious can search on google for first hand accounts of what being on drugs does/feels like.</i><p>That was <i>not</i> what my post was about, which you would know had you actually read and understood it.  This was supposed to be an opportunity for people to have an interactive experience.  Sure, if they had a specific question for me, I could answer it thoroughly.  But more importantly, if they had something they wanted me to do, I could probably just do it and report back to them what it was like.<p><i>I also find it quite morbid. In the same way I would had the OP had expressed a curiosity to know how it feels to cut off his leg.</i><p>First off, one definition of morbid is, ""ghoulish: suggesting the horror of death and decay; 'morbid details'"".  Taking <i>one</i> dose of acid <i>once</i> is certainly not going to cause long-term detrimental effects along the lines of death or decay!<p><i>(I'm not offended, and I don't think most people who flagged it are. I just don't think it's a good post for a site like this).<p>Once again though, be useful to see on each article how many people flagged it.</i><p>Why don't you feel that this was a decently creative, intellectually interesting post?  Because isn't that what this site is about, to be intellectually satisfying?  As I have mentioned, I put a good amount of effort into this, so a comment such as ""well, my personal opinion is that I don't think this is very good"" is totally not useful in any way.  Provide reasons, man.<p>Lastly, on a personal note, why did you have to keep trying to destroy the <i>one thing</i> I thought I could contribute in the last couple months?  Judging by the negative karma count of most of your comments in this thread, your views are not shared among your peers.  What you are doing is generating noise.  You are basically acting trollish.  Simply stating your opinions is rather useless, don't you think?  Perhaps you don't back up what you say because you can't, because it's my own body on the line, not yours.  As far as I can tell, you have nothing more substantial than a ""drugs are bad"" attitude.  Which is basically a witch-hunt attitude.<p>If you have any shred of respect for me or for my contributions to the site over the years, you'll just stop talking about this, because at this point, the damn thread is dead already, so anything further you have to say on the topic would just be an emotional act, whether that be to insult me personally or to just ""get something off your chest"", shall we say.  It saddens me that you put so little effort into communicating your thoughts, even when I put so much effort into communicating mine.  I would expect that kind of thing from a new member, but the worst part is that you've been here since the beginning.  Maybe you're just having a bad day.  Who knows.<p>And no, we don't need to see how many people have flagged an article, because that would cause people to focus on the 'meta' aspect of the site; that is, instead of aggregating cool content, people would be whining about why the current content doesn't satisfy their oh-so-high standards.  Which is what you are doing.  Which I specifically asked you <i>not</i> to do in the second paragraph of this thread.  ""Please don't make a meta-comment, just use the flag feature, and if it gets killed, then that's the end of it.""  But no, you had something <i>important</i> to say.  Just had to keep saying all of those important things, even after they kept getting downmodded, right?  Whatever.

From the start, their marketing team wanted to be able to offer relatively high-quality 1080p movies, with audio, at 3 megabits per second--enough to play in realtime on an ordinary broadband connection without prebuffering.<p>In almost any other situation, this would have been a total disaster: 3 megabits for 1080p is practically impossible with current technology.  However, a few things saved them:<p>1.  They realized that you don't actually need to use constant bitrate for streaming.  If you have a local hard disk for buffering, you can let the bitrate variance increase over time by slowly buffering ahead of the main movie, so that once you're a few minutes in, you have a very large buffer within which to allow variable bitrate.<p>This is the extra benefit of having local storage: a normal VOD service forces you to use constant bitrate for the entire stream.<p>2.  They used H.264 video encoded with x264.<p>This is the best case I've ever seen of the fortunes of a company practically resting on a single open source program.  They tried all sorts of solutions, and x264 was literally the only option that gave reasonably viewable output at the rates their marketers insisted on.<p>(Disclaimer: I have worked for Vudu and I develop x264 ;) )<p>IMO, this is going to be one of the make-it-or-break-it factors in the video on demand business: can you provide good enough video quality to satisfy people?  Nobody cares much about quality when watching Youtube, but in order to convince someone to <i>pay</i> for your content, the bar is vastly higher; you can no longer get away with your streams looking awful.<p>Many VOD services have failed because of this: if someone is going to pay the price of a DVD rental to watch a movie, they want it to look as good as a DVD.  This is exacerbated by the fact that the initial adopters of such services are going to be more technical users who are willing to spend significant amounts of money on their home entertainment system: the same people who will be turned off by Youtube-like video quality.<p>This is also the challenge of competing with television services: while companies like Comcast prove again and again that having tons of bandwidth doesn't mean you can't completely cock up your video quality, it's vastly easier to do a good job when you have a gigantic pipe than when you're running over someone's low-end DSL.",1240823590

People like yourself (and myself for that matter) tend to get assigned more work because they are responsible enough to ask for a new assignment once they've completed the old one.  This means you have an endless supply of work, some of which you end up taking home with you.  But the reality of that endless supply of work means that you spend most of your office time on it.<p>The people who tend to abuse workplace Internet are those who don't ask for more work but instead sit around and wait until someone comes and gives them more work.  This delay leads to a lot of personal Internet time.<p>Something else to remember is that Broadband Penetration in the U.S. is still only at 57% which means a lot of these people (who are in the lower income level to begin with due to their lack of initiative) don't have high speed internet at home.  Which leads them to do most if not all of their personal web surfing at work.",1240823372

Here are a few that I use when I'm traveling abroad:<p>- Skype<p>- Etherpad<p>- VNC (it's my policy to get clients to install VNC servers on their computers, so they can make an outgoing connection to my computer. This lets me view their exact desktop and review any problems that they might have)<p>- SSH to my office/development/production environments (you can set up SSH to act as a SOCKS proxy into the remote environment, making it feel as if you were physically there with regards to connectivity and access)<p>- SocksCap (allows you to transparently wrap any program that connects to remote stuff into the SOCKS protocol - used in conjunction with SSH)<p>I've found that I can generally service all my client requests and issues via the use of these tools. When something does fail bad, I have a PFY in my city who can get himself to the client very fast to resolve any issues which I cannot fix remotely.",1240823365

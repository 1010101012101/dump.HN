I apologize for the ambiguity, but--<p>It's very easy to point a finger at a general response and say ""that comment is aimed at this guy,"" because this guy is the tallest tree in the forest. But the comment applies to the whole forest.<p>I have no doubt that Mark is deserving of his success. Mark worked hard, Bill Gates worked hard, Warren Buffet worked hard. The kiko guys worked hard too. And if kiko took over the world, they would be invited to speak everywhere, and they will have things to say, and reporters will scribble down what they hear as if deities are speaking, when every person's interpretation of the path to success does not work for all others.<p>I believe the truth in what nickb said is right here. All instances of success are a mixture of factors, but somehow they are read as a result of one. And as such, as a general principle, I certainly believe that arrogance is always unneccessary, regardless of who you are and what you have achieved.",1175417760
7970,comment,7253,7253,0,0,lee,,,"My parents had a startup when I was a child. My mom was adventurous and worked with my dad in the business. As a little kid, I had no awareness that we were rich or poor, though we must have struggled because I remember different living situations were not as nice as others. Our family life was happiest during the building phase of the company - before success was surely won. <p>One thing I'm sure of is that my dad would have been miserable if he had a straight job and that would have affected our family a lot more than material instability. <p>There are many lessons that you can teach a child about resilience - about fortune's ups and downs and how to handle risk that are unavailable to those who put their lives on hold to rear a child. I wouldn't have had any other childhood. We had extreme fortune upheavals. At one point, the family lost everything. But dad started again and made a success. I still wound up attending an Ivy League school and hope to apply the lessons I've learned growing up to the startups I'll start.

A few of my former colleagues were quite close to the matter, and Galaxies was definitely an organization-wide failure.  Raph was far removed from actual design duties when Galaxies started to croak.<p>Btw, Raph's got a Charles River-backed startup called Areae.  It's doing some pretty cool things if you're interested in virtual worlding and web interaction.",1175414977

Another thing to consider is they(oil/gas VC) will have little or no knowledge about the Internet industry which makes it significantly more difficult to convince them the possible implications and benefits of your start up.

I planned on being at CommunityNext, which was just this past Saturday I think, but I couldn't make it. This turned out to be one of the better panels I've watched and, fortunately for me, I missed out being in the audience!<p>Did anyone here happen to attend? If so, what other great stuff did I miss?<p>",1172256316

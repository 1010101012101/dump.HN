There is an entire portion of the business world that merely goes through the motions of being successful businesses rather than actually being businesses at all. It's really weird.<p>You could look at it as investment fraud with plausible deniability. Take money, hire consultants, look busy. The only thing is, I don't think it's that explicit or intentional. I think there's a breed of person out there in the business world who does not grasp the distinction between actually doing something and imitating the appearance of doing it.",1271073516

So how does an Apple fan respond to something they intensely dislike?<p>It's very difficult to respond in an objective manner to something that you feel emotional about. Some of the best advice that I have heard over the years is to try to take yourself out of a situation and imagine that you are observing two people are arguing about the subject. What advice would you give to each of them and how does this impact the subject at hand. Bear in mind that you wouldn't necessarily advise either of them to call the other guy an idiot (even if it's true) if that would just make the other guy angry.<p>I found this PG essay to be thought provoking too: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html</a>",1271072268

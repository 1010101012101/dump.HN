I can't hardly use toolkits anymore because I keep insisting on programming in languages with sane concurrency stories and that drives the toolkits insane.<p>(I fully acknowledge the scope of my request and further fully acknowledge that this will almost certainly require something written from scratch. And that writing a toolkit from scratch is a tall order.

1984345,comment,1983692,1984030,0,0,mbleigh,,,"> Most interesting opinions come from experience. If the author has never built anything significant, perhaps they ought to stop and consider where their opinions come from.<p>The problem is that 90% of open-source libraries ARE small-to-medium size projects like the ones I've built. I didn't say I'm new to open source (I've released numerous successful projects) or even argue that for many big complex projects the GPL or other copyleft licenses are the wrong way to go. I'm simply stating that for projects like the ones I build the GPL is more likely to reduce user adoption than help build a contributing community.<p>> This assumes that the same people contributing code would refuse to do so if the project was GPL-licensed<p>Not at all. I can't think of a reason that someone would refuse to contribute to an open source project because it was under the GPL. However, my argument is that many people will never even start using a library to begin with if they don't want to put up with the licensing headaches entailed with GPL.<p>> This is also wrong. The AGPL is, like the GPL, a copyright license. It only applies if the remote application (or derived data) is itself being sent to a client.<p>I'm not extremely well versed in the AGPL, I'll concede. Are you saying that someone could build a fork of Diaspora (say Facebook forked it and rewrote their entire site on top of it), made it available to the public without releasing the source and it would be compliant with the AGPL? If so, I retract my statements about the AGPL, but I'm under a different impression.",1291837875

This implies that even if you have a talent, you'll <i>still</i> have to invest a lot of time.<p>""A friend"" is not stats. This is stats:<p><i>Long periods of necessary preparation can also be inferred for writers and scientists, although the starting point of their careers is more difficult to determine. Scientists have reported that they made a career decision during their middle or late teens, whereas they most often published a truly major contribution one or two decades later (Lehmann, 1953). Raskin (1936), who analyzed the 120 most important scientists and 123 most famous poets and authors in the 19th century, found that the average age at which scientists published their first work was 25.2; poets and authors published their first work at the average age of 24.2. Moreover, many years of preparation preceded first publication. The average ages at which the same individuals produced their greatest work were 35.4 for scientists and 34.3 for poets and authors. That is, on average, more than 10 years elapsed between these scientists' and authors' first work and their best work. In many other domains, the highest level of expert performance is displayed by individuals with more than 10 years of experience: evaluation of livestock (Phelps & Shanteau, 1978), diagnosis of X-rays (Lesgold, 1984), and medical diagnosis (Patel & Groen, 1991). This evidence is consistent with Gallon's (1869/1979) claim that motivation and perseverance are necessary for attainment of eminent performance.</i>",1291836868

In the right fundraising environment this might even be 20% or 25%, but 33% is the right default assumption if you have no information.<p>Another hidden variable is the presence of liquidation preferences for VCs. Some funding agreements allow VC's to ""double-dip"", ie take their liquidation preference and then also take their full percentage of the leftover amount. However, with YC advising them and with the Heroku founders having a reputation inside YC as being good fundraisers, I think there's no way Heroku's VC's got this.<p>If you assume no double-dipping, a 33% dilution per round,  a YC-average 6% stake in Heroku, and an average amount per YC startup of $20K, YC's share of Heroku is enough to pay for their investment in every YC company ever up until this point, and also all the companies in the next two batches assuming they are the same size as the most recent (and largest ever) batch.

To enter: a 6-month internship in a design-related field. I believe that they also consider relevant work experience.<p>2. The program is a bit different than most schools; instead of classes, you work on projects. Any student can take any project (with some limitations) and students of all years work together.<p>Subjects: essentially, there are around 15 departments: audiovisual media, manufacturing, service design, typography, interface design, etc.<p>To graduate, one must take at least 1 project in 10 of the departments, and fulfill the certain amount of project points. There’s also some other “classes”, like seminars and workshops. Hence the name “integrated design” – you can, for the most part, “design” your study curriculum out of the offered projects.<p>3.

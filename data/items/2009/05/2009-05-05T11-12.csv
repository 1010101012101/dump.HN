You've taken an emotionally charged statement from some random bystander and turned it into a conspiracy where there is in fact none. The NoScript <i>extension</i> is NOT blocking Ghostery behaviour.<p>It is in fact the noscript website, along with Giorgio Maone's other websites, that are blocking the Ghostery box, through the stylesheets.

""Just to clarify, the NoScript <i>program</i> NEVER blocked Ghostery: this would have been unacceptable as much as the ABP workaround.<p>But the CSS is in the <i>website</i>, and it doesn't prevent Ghostery from working (the status bar info is still there).<p>Ghostery should use a notification bar like NoScript does: trying to delivery notifications overlaying the content is never a good idea, especially if it's security or privacy related, because it's entirely in the site's rights and powers to tamper with it (hide, relocate, or even worse maliciously modifying its content to mislead users).<p><i>BTW, it was done not to hide any info from the user, but because the box covered the donation button.

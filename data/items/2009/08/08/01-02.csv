That means major dilution at best, <i>assuming</i> such a startup can get funding at all.<p>Even so, bootstrap startups are proliferating in Silicon Valley (and I assume elsewhere) and will be in line to approach VCs down the road if they deem it desirable, but on much better terms and with much higher valuations.

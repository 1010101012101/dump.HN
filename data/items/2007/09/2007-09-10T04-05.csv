Finding 30 investors that will sit through your demo is something most developers don't know anything about. GGP is conspicuously silent on how to pull off that trick without YC.""<p>It's not as hard as you think.  The difference YC offers is that you're already at stage two of the VC or angel process: Vetted candidate.  You get to do a one hour presentation for one member of the VC firms, maybe a partner, instead of having a ten minute phone call to make your pitch.  You still have to meet the investors you want to talk to...but they are actively looking for deals in the valley every day.  Go to events and you will meet them.  If you build something popular, some will even come to you (maybe the hungrier ones...Sequoia isn't Googling for new investment ideas).",1189400266

That sounds like it's leaving out a lot of steps, however.""<p>You'd be surprised how easy the ""get contacts"" step becomes when you're in the valley.  I was.  I fought it for years, as I loved living in Austin.  But, events where you can rub elbows with investors happen every single week here...it's a world apart from anywhere else.",1189399764
52694,comment,52580,52661,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""You haven't explained how your start-up succeeded without YC.""<p>Nobody asked.<p>I'll take your response as somebody asking.<p>In both cases, I made myself a recognized expert on an Open Source project that I liked a lot and that I liked the people involved (Squid in the first case, Webmin in the latter...though the first also included a huge amount of Webmin-related work and inspired the second).  And then I founded companies built on making some Open Source project easier to use, more powerful, better documented, and more popular.  The first never really made it out of the ""consulting business"" stage, though I constantly tried to convert it to a product business...had I been in the valley, I would have been able to make it work the way I wanted it to.  It was a hardware based business, and for that you need volume, which I didn't have the capital to deal with--closing a big sale in the server appliance industry can cost tens of thousands of dollars before seeing any cashflow from it.  So, stay out of hardware if you don't have the capital to see it through.   Even then, you probably ought to stay out of hardware.  So, the first one did not succeed without YC, by my standards, but did buy me a 350Z and keep me in food and houses for 7 years.<p>The primary thing worth learning from the first business (which I built without not only YC but without any outside investment for involvement) was that you can't do it alone.  Get a partner, get to the valley (I don't even bother saying get to a ""startup hub"" because nobody is doing deals in Boston), get to work.<p>As for the second, here's what I know so far:<p>1. Start or join, very early, an Open Source project.<p>2. Work on it for several years.  Get millions of downloads and millions of users.<p>3. ...<p>4. Profit!<p>""> seen Guy Kawasaki's Art of the Start<p>I hope you're kidding about that. ""<p>Of course not.  Guy's a great motivator.  Can't start a business worth crap (see Truemors), but he has a lot of good stuff to say about marketing, salesmanship, morale-building, and lots more.  Some accidental experts really do have good advice.",1189399607

52692,comment,52501,52687,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Certainly part of the problem is the time barrier. IIRC Guy Kawasaki said he averages seven hours per post. It's about the same for me for my posts that have made techmeme or reddit. I'd love to sit down and blog something about the social policy implications of pygmalion effect or whatever but it's hard justify blowing off an entire day more than a couple times a month. <p>The other problem though is that there is very little theory surrounding what actually makes something insightful, informative, interesting, etc. There are hundreds of books or grammar and style, but try looking for a book on insightfulness. Google turns up literally zero useful results. If there were a book like Strunk/White but on substance, not style, it would greatly ameliorate the problem. I've been working on the problem for a while now myself, not from the perspective of a great writer but rather from the perspective of someone who knows what creates value for him as a reader. The problem is before you publish something like that it kind of has to be perfect. ",1189399019

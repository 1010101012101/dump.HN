You have to pay for the local cops, but there&#x27;s little they hate more than handling multiple false intrusion alarms from small businesses, and they have no legally enforceable obligation to protect you or your business.  That won&#x27;t stop them from sending you a bill for responding to a false alarm, even if they arrive 6 hours after receiving it.<p>Aside from making your first line of defense private security, make offsite backups for all your business records, and refresh them regularly.  Insure your business against damages from typical property crimes, and against potential liabilities for visitors to your premises, and follow your agent&#x27;s advice on things to do that will decrease your premiums.  Hire a registered agent so that legal documents do not arrive via deputy at your regular office.<p>The best interaction you can have with the cops is to never need one or see one.  Second best is to be assisted by a cop that acts with honesty, respect, and professionalism.  Beyond that, results will vary drastically according to your locale.<p>Rule number one is to <i>not have</i> routine interactions with the police.

This is a relatively vague term when it comes to responsibilities and deliverables and tends to vary from team to team.  Generally, though, they will tend to be more customer facing than engineers - collecting information from the customers and creating a plan for the Engineers to execute.<p>While this might sound like the old Office Space gag that they &quot;take the specs from the customers and bring them to the engineers&quot;, a good PM brings a lot of value to the team and - in the classical PM role - frees up the engineers to worry about implementation and less about what this message should say when this error happens.<p>But a <i>great</i> PM will come up with product strategy and just do <i>whatever needs to be done</i> to get the software out the door.  Sometimes this means working closely with lawyers.  Sometimes this means working closely with the security team.  Sometimes this means writing code.  Or making sure the marketing team is on the same page as the product team.  Or that the sales team knows how to pitch this and has all the materials they need to present.  Or presenting to customers at conferences.<p>Sometimes this means baking cupcakes for the team, just because.<p>It&#x27;s a time consuming, unenviable position in a lot of ways.

This is a small wrapper around classical conditioning. Acts associated with things like pain are bad.<p>The second, which you&#x27;ll see in slightly older children, is to act to be rewarded. By this stage, morality is now a wrapper around operant conditioning, and children are able to seek out things they want.<p>The third is social convention; things are moral if people are okay with your doing them. By the time a kid is 12 or 13 they&#x27;re probably in this stage if their development is normal.<p>The fourth is authority. Things are moral if an authority says they&#x27;re moral. This comes with the realization that the people in your life aren&#x27;t important just because they&#x27;re the people in your life, they&#x27;re important because they were <i>appointed</i> by some authority. A teacher is a representative of a school system, and a principal is a higher representative of that system. Police are representatives of governments. Politicians are higher representatives of the abstract idea of governments.<p>There are two other stages, but the classification breaks down at this point and they represent more what the psychologist writing the paper thinks more than what actually exists, because <i>almost nobody gets past the fourth stage.</i><p>Most humans are entirely content to backend all of their reasoning on authorities.<p>For most people, it&#x27;s impossible for the government to violate laws. The government is the law. And further, it&#x27;s not wrong for the government to violate laws. They&#x27;re the government. They create morality.<p>Finally, outside of the entire argument I&#x27;ve made up to this point in my comment, people <i>pick</i> politicians -- not in a meaningful sense, but they join the <i>team</i> surrounding the politician. A politician is either on their team or not. Politicians on the <i>other</i> team are corrupt all the time -- but not politicians on <i>our</i> team.<p>My only hope is that eventually people wake up and realize no politician, no police officer is on their team.<p>But I&#x27;m not holding my breath.",1414170068

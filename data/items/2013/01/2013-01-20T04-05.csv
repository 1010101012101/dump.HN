They had it shipped to the US in pieces, and then flew over a crew of engineers and techs to put it back together.  They had a few extra days in the US at the end of the process, so the US crew and the Czech crew agreed that it'd be fun to go fishing.<p>They stopped by a grocery store on the way out.  When the Czech guys saw there weren't any lines and food was plentiful, they got upset.  They thought they were being shown propaganda.  The group ended up cancelling the fishing trip and spending the whole day just driving all over town and stopping at all sorts of grocery stores, big and small, to prove that they were seeing the real experience of real Americans instead of an elaborate deception.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.museumofflight.org/aircraft/mikoyan-gurevich-mig-21-pfm-fishbed-f"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.museumofflight.org/aircraft/mikoyan-gurevich-mig-...</a> -- I worked here for several years, and heard the story from multiple sources, including the notes Jim Blue wrote about it.",1358657448

Everything else is incidental.<p>Story time:<p>Back in 1999, I worked on instant messaging infrastructure, and as a result followed the related IETF workgroup closely. That workgroup had very interesting discussions that went absolutely nowhere over a few years. At some point, everyone threw their hands up in the air and adopted XMPP - not because it was good (far from it, compared to other suggestions that were made) - but because an implementation was made and progressing, and becoming a de-facto standard.<p>What I realized through 1999-2002 following the standardization process was that, although every single argument ever made was of a technical nature, it was a game played between AOL, MS, Netscape and the other members of the workgroup, the game being ""either you guys accept my existing infrastructure and give me dominance, or I'm not sharing my toys"". And since no one gave up, toys -- to this day -- are not shared, and IM networks are still mostly disjoint.<p>The WebRTC game might be more delicate, but the validity of the technical arguments (which was there in the IM discussions too) should not confuse you.

The benchmark only goes up to 100000 elements, which for an int is only 390K. This can be an advantage of vector, but it's not necessarily such a slam-dunk in real-world programs where there are multiple data structures and other threads contending for the use of the cache.<p># The value type has 'trivial' copy/move constructors and assignment operators. It's POD and outright memmove()-able.<p># The benchmark code is only able to use list nodes one time. It doesn't take advantage of a list's ability to move items from one container to another without reallocation.<p># The benchamark is thoroughly randomized. If it were more typical real-world data (such as supplied by another algorithm or even a malicious attacker) then you would want to consider the possibility of pathological access patterns arising.<p>So if you meet all of these conditions, definitely use a vector.

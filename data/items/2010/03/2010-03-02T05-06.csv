1160699,comment,1153181,1160575,0,0,anamax,,,"> From what I know, the US has Medicaid (means-tested), Medicare (>65), and other ones like Veterans, but nothing that covers the bulk of the population.<p>""means tested"" means ""poor people are eligible"".  A huge fraction of the supposedly uninsured are eligible for Medicaid, Medicare, and/or other programs but don't bother to sign up until they seek care.  In other words, they look like they're uninsured but they're not.<p>In addition, everyone is eligible for free care at the local county or city medical center.  They often try to send bills, but you're free to ignore them.  That's the free program to which I referred.  I mention it because most folks ""forget it"", concentrating only on the big federal programs.  (It's a federal mandate but paid for by local govts.)<p>What?  Your sources didn't mention those things?  Oops.  (Do you always believe politicians or only the ones that say things consistent with your world view?)<p>The US' health care problems come from lifestyle choices.  Medical care can't address smoking or obesity, for example.  (Yes, US doctors tell folks ""don't smoke and lose weight"".)<p>Here's are some questions for you.  Why do Canadian politicans come to the US for health care?  (Often paid for by Canadian tax payers....)  Do US politicans go out of the country for health care?  If your favorite national health care system didn't provide a treatment that you needed, where would you go?<p>As to the money - we have it.  What would you have us spend it on instead?  (It doesn't much matter to us if others couldn't afford it.)<p>Also, there's no reason to believe that the US govt can do better.  It already provides health care to a huge fraction of the population yet doesn't do so more efficiently.<p>That said, I've always been willing to let the US govt experiment wrt health care for the folks it already covers.  (Including govt employees, this is roughly half the US population.)  Yes, free rein to try anything.  All that I ask is that the per-person budget get cut by 5% per year for years 2-6.  For some reason, govt healthcare advocates are unwilling to take this deal even though they claim that they can get 30% from the whole population.",1267508733

1160697,comment,1160140,1160385,0,0,tensor,,,"I agree with this, and would like to expand on it a bit. For me personally, I do not mind that the iPad is ""simple"" or even single tasking. The problem is that the software that is run on it is controlled. Worse, it is controlled by a company who has already demonstrated that they are happy to deny applications based on money interests or the opinions of their primarily US market.<p>Last year they decided joke political apps were ""not worth offending their user base"" for and banned them. This year they ban all applications related to sexuality for the same reason. Web browsers and email clients are banned for money interests. It goes without saying that apps like itunes are banned.<p>What is next? Apps related to evolution and science?  Any 3rd party apps related to music? Who knows. Maybe nothing, maybe all those things.<p>This sets a FAR more dangerous precedent than Microsoft's monopoly on the OS market. And as this article correctly points out, very few people outside of IT will care. For them it will be ""why isn't there app X, guess IT people are just boring/uncreative/didn't think of it, oh well.""<p>This level of control is enough for me to buy an alternative product, even if it may not be quite as good.",1267508665

We've got a near-perfect substitute for a massively popular game that's missing from Android - if we could only put it in front of the casual gamers who only look at the featured and top ranked list, I'm sure it would be a bigger hit than most of the games currently featured.  I'm hopeful that the great feedback and very good sales relative to our position that we receive will eventually catch someone at Google's notice, but until then we'll just keep making the game better.<p>On a down note, the recent rating reorganization seems to make it tougher for newer apps in our position to move up the list - a lot of poorly rated and abandoned junk from early in the Android platform's life is above us again now that the ranking algorithm seems to value raw sales above all else.<p>Still, things are worlds better than they were 6 months ago.

1160690,comment,1158589,1160409,0,0,AngryParsley,,,"I guess duty was a poor word choice. Would you agree with this line of reasoning?: The world would be a better place if the most intelligent people worked to solve problems that cause the most harm to humanity. If an exceptionally intelligent person doesn't work on these problems, more people will die and/or suffer. This is bad, so exceptionally intelligent people should work on these problems even if they find more personal satisfaction in less important problems.<p>That's basically what I meant by ""duty."" Now to address the specific points in your post:<p><i>Nobody asks in advance to be born intelligent.</i><p>Correct. Currently life is very very unfair. Nobody asks to be born into poverty and ignorance either.<p><i>Can you think of any other trait one could be born with which you would say bestows someone with a duty to lead their life in a certain way?</i><p>These aren't genetic traits but they can be inherited: Wealth. Power, such as in a monarchy.<p><i>...aren't they squandering all their hard-earned experience and knowledge in X?</i><p>There are a couple of differences in your example. First, not all degrees are equally useful. A Ph.D. in Russian literature isn't going to be very useful in curing disease or engineering hardier crops. Second, education can't fully substitute for fluid intelligence.<p><i>I also think it's absolutely absurd to say someone's squandering their talents and not ""aiding humanity"" when they have a Ph.D. in physics, they're a civil engineer, and they've published ninety academic papers.</i><p>Compared to most people, yes, he has helped a lot. But if this guy really is the smartest person on the earth, he is wasting his potential. Bad things are happening -bad things will happen- that wouldn't have happened if he worked in biotech or physics or cognitive neuroscience.<p>Here's a silly but analogous situation: If Superman was a social worker, wouldn't you be frustrated that he wasn't doing superhero stuff? Sure, social worker Superman has helped more than most individuals, but he could do so much more.<p>The fact is that we all aren't born equal, but we all hurt; we get sick; we die. It's completely unfair. We need to fix it. The more great minds we have devoted to these problems, the sooner they'll be in the history books instead of the nightly news.",1267508373

I'm not even talking about all my friends. (I'm not even a CS major.) I'm talking about pretty much all the people in my high school. And all the kids which the media portrays as technically savvier than their parents. So unless my high school was somehow unusually technically capable, I don't think I've been a victim to selection.<p>But I do understand what you're saying. Obviously there will be people who will be more technically savvy than others, but the overall trend will be towards more new technology in our lives. What seems new and complicated now will just be pencils and erasers to the next generation. So while I do believe that technology will become more transparent (more natural), I don't think it should/will become dumbed down.<p>> This is a classic geek fallacy. This is the reason smart phones were so godawfully unusable before the iPhone came out. Ask any designer—removing things can dramatically improve a user experience because it decreases the cognitive load.<p>Yea I'm well aware of that. I don't think good design and power are mutually exclusive. But I was specifically referring to the general idea that simplifying things naturally results in less power. The trick is to simplify it without sacrificing power, in which you'll result with what we call design. But I think it's important to realize that simplifying without sacrificing <i>any</i> power is probably impossible. You'll undoubtedly lose some degree of power. Closing the app platform results in a simplified experience, but we can all agree it takes some power away from developers too. I probably shouldn't have used the word ""experience."" I meant experience to describe the capabilities of the system.",1267507761

Effectively all it means is that you can't cold start it. How big a problem this is depends like anything else on the application in question.",1267506683

It's not a terrible game, but it's not great either.  The free-version reviews are not very good (technical reasons), but some people who bought the paid version left raving reviews.<p>Like everything else, it's about quality and marketing.  Once you leave the ""just in"" page in the Android market, you vanish.  If you want to make this kind of money, I ""guess"" you better be good enough to be featured, have a 4-5 star rating, and find ways to get noticed (blogging, etc).  That being said, I haven't done any of these - so it's all assumption.<p>As for price, I can attest that for my second game I put out, lowering my price killed sales.  The numbers weren't high enough to say what price works or not, but statistically, lowering didn't work.  The price was raised from $0.99 to $1.99 again today and I'm waiting for new results.",1267506294

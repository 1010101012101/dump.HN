In some cases I even had to resort to locks because it was easier to handle IO that way.<p>Now, Haskell's type system would just not allow having any sort of IO side effects inside a STM transaction. Yes, having to explicitly handle IO may sound as a lot of work, but in my experience it makes everything easier.",1340654394

4158420,comment,4156924,4158086,7,0,glesica,,,"I just used Craigslist to find an apartment about 1.5 months ago. Based on my experience, I disagree with you. Sure, a slick interface would be cool, but it could very well change the nature of the site in a bad way.<p>I agree that it would be awesome to be able to filter listings on Craiglist through a neat-o UI mechanism (""Hipmunk for apartments maybe"").<p>In fact, I basically spent the entire time I was using the site thinking ""if only more landlords indicated whether the apartment is pet-friendly..."". I ended up calling a ton of landlords just to find out whether they allowed pets, on the off chance that some of those who had listed no pet policy actually allowed them.<p>But is that really a UI problem? For me, Craigslist has already provided the UI tools I needed (you can search by pet-friendliness). The problem was that the landlords didn't include that information in their listings in the first place.<p>Craigslist is a site for ""classified ads"". Traditional classifieds (in newspapers) were usually very short, just a few words. Of course far more is possible with Craigslist, but a larger ad also requires more effort on the part of the seller.<p>As it is now, incomplete information has a cost for sellers (people skip their ads), but they can choose to bear that cost if they wish, presumably after comparing it against the cost of providing more complete information. Part of the reason people use Craigslist is that it is more or less a willy-nilly market that is friendly to small sellers.<p>So what would Craigslist have to do to make a new UI worthwhile (for me)? Enforce data completeness on the sellers. But that would turn people off. Requiring additional bookkeeping or punishing sellers for ""incomplete"" listings just to make a snappy UI practical would harm the community and the site.",1340654357

Yes, coal is really cheap, but one reason it's really cheap is because we allow people who burn it to pass on a huge proportion of the cost to the public at large.<p>Any article discussing the cheapness of coal without mentioning the high hidden costs we pay in the form of pollution is really misleading.",1340654351

4158414,comment,4157953,4157953,13,0,jaredsohn,,,"It seems like they didn't change your previous preferences but rather added a new one and changed how they interpret preferences as to what is displayed.<p>If you look at your list of e-mail addresses, it will let you choose who to share it with if it should be shown on timeline.
Previously I had a real e-mail address that was being shared with friends and another real address that was for 'only me'.
When I looked at my preferences today, I saw that those settings remained intact and that it added a third @facebook.com address that was being shared with only me.<p>I think the second field might be brand new. It says either ""Shown on timeline"" or ""Hidden on timeline"" and when I looked today it showed both of the email addresses that I had previously set up as hidden and the new facebook.com one as shown. If they would have just marked the e-mail address that I had set up to be shared with friends as ""shown"" and added the @facebook.com address as ""shown"", I (and suspect many others) would be happy and it would still allow them to emphasize that people can use @facebook.com e-mail addresses.  (Some people might not like this for spam reasons, but I think this is would be far less evil than what they did.)<p>Also, since they don't share e-mail addresses via the social graph or have other ways of viewing data, what is the point of differentiating 'show on timeline' with specifying who you share it with? None of the other fields (phone number, IM screen name, address etc.) include this ""show on timeline field"" but rather set visibility based on the sharing settings. It seems like the ""show on timeline"" field is completely unnecessary and was only added to get the effect that we're all talking about.  (So this was clearly evilness rather than incompetence; for some preference system changes one could argue that it was necessary to 'break' old preferences since the new ones were so different, but that isn't the case here.)",1340654310

Every measure of inflation measures some basket of goods; what if I want to buy something else with my inflating currency? Then this measure isn't relevant for me. Also, how can we know whether prices rise due to an increase in the money supply or due to something else? Consider the following example where <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> all denote a certain good. <i>m</i> denotes the monetary good. At first, the relationship, in price, between these goods is the following:<p>p=2m, q=0.7m, r=1.4m, s=8m, t=0.2m, u=0.6m, v=4.5m<p>after a while the prices change and now the relationship is the following:<p>p=2.5m, q=0.5m, r=1.2m, s=7m, t=0.2m, u=2m, v=4.6m<p>What role has an inflation in the monetary supply played in the change in prices and what role has factors such as scarcity, difficulty of production, labor costs, etc. played in the change of prices?

</code></pre>
In the UK at least, the option for landlords to spend 20 to advertise their rental (in our case on Rightmove), obtain a contract, conduct referencing, handle the deposit and other traditional agencies services, is resulting in landlords being able to lower their headline rental fees.<p>Our landlords have traditionally listed at far below what the same property is listed at with a traditional agent. So these savings are, in part, passed on to tenants.<p>One must remember that agents will charge landlords 5-11% of the <i>annual rent</i> just to find a tenant, plus the hundreds of pounds they charge <i>tenants</i> in admin fees. This does not even include management fees.<p>Removing these unjustified fees, and creating a fair marketplace, can only benefit tenants rather than harm them.

And both inflation and demurrage are ""continuously assessed,"" it's just that losses to inflation aren't immediately measurable.<p>No, inflation is measurably delayed and hurts the poor and middle class more than it does the wealthy because insiders have preferential access to credit, allowing them to <i>benefit</i> from inflation. Instantly and continuously assessed demurrage would remove that preferential treatment.<p>> Even if the timing of inflation/demurrage costs were different, could you explain more about the link between the timing of fees and the sustainability of investments? I don't see how the two are related.<p>Demurrage reduces interest, where interest can have negative/short-sighted effects. As the value of an investment is calculated by discounting future cash flows by the expected interest rate, a lower interest rate means investments generating sustainable cash flow are more likely to be preferred than a one-time ROI.<p>The classic example being clear-cutting a forest vs. sustainably harvesting it. The incentive is to clear-cut the forest when there are high interest rates, as the cash can be re-invested, whereas a sustainable logging model makes more sense as the long-term interest rate approaches zero.",1340652222

The product just looks and feels broken and I've been interested in seeing how larger organizations use it because (and I think I've posted this sentiment on HN before) there's got to be tools out there that are better put-together and user-friendly (Jive, et al?). As such, our staff still relies on email, document servers and our internal CRM.",1340651538

It depends on the reward structure and how frequent it is. The infrequent push to finish a release, fine. A consistent/constant expectation that salaried (no paid overtime at all) employees be working over ~40 hours a week is obscene. It's different, I'd argue, for lawyers and factory workers as their reward structures are a bit different.<p>>Do you view company B as not deserving to exist?<p>Only if said overtime is necessary for their business model to function. A business that has to abuse its own people in order to exist is just a scam hidden by abstraction and cultural acceptance. If it's doing so out of greed, then the reward structure needs revised. Law firms resolved this a long time ago.<p>>Do you not support my desire to work in the company and environment that I wish to?<p>I'm talking about abusing people who don't want to work all that overtime and spend time with their families. My company already has one person in particular who works odd/lots of hours. I don't begrudge him that, it's just an aspect of how he manages his time.

4198173,comment,4195115,4196073,3,0,philwelch,,,"Suppose there are 1000 tickets for a show that are $20 each. There are 5000 people in town who would buy a ticket at that price. Without any scalping, the first 1000 people who show up get a ticket and 4000 people go home unhappy.<p>With scalping, the first 1000 people who show up still get tickets. 900 of them are scalpers. (So if you were in the first 100, you still got to pay face value.) I'm being very generous with this scenario--I've personally never seen a situation where this was a real problem, as I've gone to every ticketed event I've ever wanted to paying face value.<p>The 900 scalpers all pick different prices. At $40, there are about 2000 people left in town who want to buy a ticket. Some of them get tickets, but the other scalpers get wise and think, why not charge more? So they charge $50. Or $60. Eventually they reach a point where there are exactly n tickets left, and exactly n people left in town who are willing to buy at that price. If the scalpers overprice the ticket, no one will buy, so they'll need to lower the price again. But generally, what's reached is a fair price that sees all the tickets go to people who actually were willing to buy them at the price they bought them at.<p>So let's look at what's happened. Without scalping, you have 4000 people who missed out on buying tickets because they weren't first in line and 1000 people going to a show. With scalping, you still have 1000 people going to a show, but instead of all of them being picked on the less-than-perfectly-fair basis of who was first in line (which is a disadvantage to people with more work, more responsibilities, inconveniently timed emergencies, and slow internet connections), some of them are picked based on who was first in line, and some of them are picked based on who was willing to pay more (which is a disadvantage to people with less money).<p>You might think, well, it's better to be unfair to busy people than to be unfair to poor people. But let's change this thought experiment and say the face value of the tickets was $60 to begin with instead of $20, and at $60, there are exactly 1000 people in town who are willing to buy a ticket. Now there are no scalpers (or if any scalpers do show up, they can only resell the ticket for face value anyway). I would argue that this scenario is strictly <i>less</i> fair than the scenario where the face value was $20 and there was some scalping, because at least in the first scenario, it was <i>possible</i> to get a lower price by getting in line first!<p>Fundamentally, <i>what difference does it make</i> who's setting the price? You might say, well, if the face value was $60, at least the performer (or the venue, or the ticket vendor) is getting the extra money, not just some ""scalper"". But the scalper is effectively getting in line <i>for</i> you. He's going out of his way to do the leg work for you. You know who else we pay a premium to for doing the leg work? Shopkeepers. Sure, if we really wanted to, we could go to some warehouse and save some money by buying all our stuff off a pallet. (You still can if you want to--it's called Costco.) But maybe I'd rather some other guy does all that legwork for me, and in exchange, I'll pay more. And if you're running around doing legwork for other people, <i>you are benefitting those people</i>.",1341388020

I will focus on a first time entrepreneur's case and use realistic numbers.<p>1) You have and idea. You make as much progress as you can before trying to raise.<p>2) Ideally, you network with some angel investors / micro VC's before you start talking about your round.<p>3) You incorporate your company. You will issue an arbitrary  number of shares for the co-founders (typically 10M+) and you allocate some shares as an option pool (typically 10-20%). Option pool will be used to give shares to employees, advisors, consultants and board members.<p>4) You decide that you have made enough progress to raise a round (doing this too early will be bad for you)<p>5) You talk to a lot of angel investors and early stage VC funds. Angel investor is somebody who invests his/her own money, VC is a person who invests other people's money. That's the only real difference.<p>6) If somebody is interested, you start talking about the terms. Now you really have to learn the jargon.<p>Let's assume you will do a traditional priced round. You will negotiate a pre-money valuation (typically $2-10M for first time entrepreneurs). Let's say an investor proposes you $1M with a $4M pre money valuation (means your post-money valuation is $5M) and you had initially issued 10M total shares. Each of your shares will be worth $4M/10M = $0.25. Your company will issue $1M/0.24 = 4M new shares for your investors. So you don't actually sell shares, you just issue new shares which will reduce your ownership percentage of the company(by 20% in this case). This deal could be done with a single investor (usually a VC) or a group of investors who are each putting smaller chunks.<p>There's another format called ""Convertible Note/Debt"". It has become popular in silicon valley. Instead of negotiating  a pre-money valuation, you negotiate for a discount rate (let's say 25%) and an annual interest rate (let's say 8%). In this case you don't immediately issue shares to investors. Instead you promise to give them shares when you do your next priced round (Series A) with the valuation that those investors pay / (1+discount rate) / (1+interest rate). For example if you get a pre-money valuation of $20M a year after the convertible note, your angel investors will get shares worth $1M<i>(1+0.25)</i>(1+0.08) = $1.35M from the $20M pre-money valuation. That will be $1.35 / ($20M / 10M) = 675K shares.<p>The most common format these days is a convertible note with a cap on the valuation. Typically the cap is negotiated just like a valuation. If you get a valuation higher than the cap in your Series A, angel investors will get shares from the cap you agreed on instead of the full price.<p>7) Typically, the investors give you a term sheet. When the negotiations are over, they go through a due diligence period. They will ask for some docs to check there was any BS in your pitch. In a seed round, this is usually very lightweight.",1341387711

I do understand the global impact of a forum such as this, and I certainly understand the ramifications of a networked society. I suggest, however, that the network in this case is far smaller than supposed.<p>The next example is dangerous to pull off as the topic is polarizing: there is another forum called Stormfront which is the site to be a part of if you are a white supremacist (don't Google if you're at work). There are millions of posts and, I'm sure, millions of eyeballs consuming that site. If I were to ask a supporting member of Stormfront how Stormfront affects the world, they'd probably spend hours telling me about the epic discussions and hundreds of people that they know worldwide, and give me a similar answer as you -- you don't understand the global impact of what we're doing nor the network of people that Stormfront has built.<p>However, you and I, rational people who think that sort of shit is outer space bananas, can quickly trivialize that community because we're detached from it. Does it matter to the (much larger) community of non-white-supremacists if someone has a name in that community? Not really. So it is with Hacker News; those who think the discussions here are outer space bananas don't care about Dustin Curtis, or the flavor of the week in startups. Within a community, it is easy to start thinking that community is all-consuming and, I am here to tell you, it isn't. I think being inside Hacker News distorts views on what it actually does in the world, and what its reach is.<p>(Stop. Before you say what you're thinking, I'm not comparing Hacker News to Stormfront beyond that they're both forums with audiences.)<p>Since you qualified with familiarity with Dustin Curtis:<p>Before some of his posts began making the front page, I had no idea who Dustin Curtis is. I still don't, really, and my gut says he's just some UI designer slash neuroscientist who got lucky with a Hacker News audience from the AA thing, and is now considered some kind of influential voice on startups and business. If I'm wrong, I'm sorry, but I dug <i>deep</i> in his site looking for a clue about his career or qualifications to be a pundit on modern startups and came up pretty much dry. So I hold his opinions in the same regard as most pundits, that of immediate suspicion. That isn't a reflection on him as a person, either.",1341386529

Accutane contains isotretnoin, a retinoid used to treat skin diseases, particularly acne vulgaris. Accutane is one of the controversial drugs in US that are blamed to be causing much damage with their side effects. The drug, manufactured by Roche in US, was pulled from the markets following the lawsuit compensations that Roche had to provide to the victims.<p>Accutane was available in the markets as early as 1982. It was approved by FDA back then. In the initial years, the drug was a great success as sales were very high. Those were the days when dermatologists prescribed Accutane without any second thoughts.<p>Accutane, since it is a kind of a retinoid (related to Vitamin A), was known to be carrying teratogenic risks from the beginning. The drug was generally not prescribed to females during their pregnancy. The popularity of Accutane started dipping from the year 1999. As more and more studies were conducted, some permanent and severe side effects of Accutane came to be known. One of the most common side effects was the inflammatory bowel disease, for which hundreds of lawsuits were filed.<p>La Roche was happy with the sales of Accutane, while the damage done by Accutane was piling up. The wave of lawsuits made Roche to be worried as the information and warnings on the drug were insufficient and inadequate. People after suffering severe injuries filed enormous lawsuits and petitions against Roche. FDA in order to support such cases issued repeated warnings to Roche instructing them to include proper warning on the drug label. This further helped healthcare experts and people to be aware about the danger Accutane was carrying.<p>Even after settlements in many cases and years of research it was noted that Accutane effects were severe and even life threatening. As a result the drug was finally recalled and a complete ban was levied on its sale in 2009.<p>After seeing such cases, it seems imperative for people to get educated and aware about the composition and after effects of any drug to protect them from facing anything so serious later.<p>For more information visit http://www.unsafedrugs.com/4598/accutanes-ban",1341385551

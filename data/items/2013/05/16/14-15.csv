5718891,comment,5716302,5718331,12,0,Millennium,,,"There's more to it even than that. One-dimensional perfection (within the context of the story; ""flawed"" characters whose flaws are treated as meaningless still quality) is an important aspect of Mary Sues, but it takes more than that to be a Sue. Perfection is, in fact, one of three critical aspects.<p>The second critical aspect of a Mary Sue is being unnaturally placed at the center of the plot. The ""unnatural"" part is important: a character who makes sense as the focal point of his or her own plotlines is not a Sue. This is what makes Sues in fanfiction easier to spot than Sues in original works: you can compare a fanfiction to the original story, and see if it flows the same way. When the work itself is original, you have no basis for comparison: you have to look at more subtle (but, in some ways, more egregious) flaws in the writing. It happens, but it's easier to mask.<p>All Sues are wish-fulfillment characters, but not all wish-fulfillment characters are Sues. The difference between them brings us to the third critical aspect. Most wish-fulfillment characters represent the reader, but a Sue, by contrast, represents the author in particular. Authors and readers can of course have the same fantasies -indeed, some would say the entire point of fiction is to make this happen- but a Sue gets too intensely personal, to the point where it becomes harder for anyone but the author to relate to the Sue: it breaks the rapport between the character and the reader.",1368716013

It's because the skill of picking great problems and managing people is massively valuable. If it weren't, then all the companies that emphasized market over technology would go bankrupt, and companies that emphasized technology over market would succeed.<p>Now, someone who can understand what people want <i>and</i> understand what's possible with technology is significantly more valuable than someone with either individual skill.

It's improved, technically, but the community is now hyper-fragmented. Best practices are routinely ignored. Frameworks don't inter-operate even on the most basic level. There's no leadership.

Code that can only be tested indirectly through integration testing (spinning up huge unwieldy hunks of context that are required for the individual sub-component to work properly) is not very modular.<p>Modular code tends to have fewer dependencies and tends to produce fewer side effects. All of these things make for code which is generally easier to maintain and modify, easier to understand, easier to debug, and easier to reuse. All of which tend to lead to higher code quality naturally.<p>A high level of unit test coverage also gives you other benefits, of course, but I thought I'd highlight these side benefits because they are perhaps the most important.",1368715623

You will likely be a foreign contractor, and the startup will pay salary to your Indian bank account. You will likely not owe income tax to the US because the service is technically performed overseas, but you'll have to pay tax to India.<p>- Invite your team to work overseas together: Stripe prototyped the service in Buenos Aires. Buffer traveled to Hong Kong and Israel. We spent our first months in Thailand. Going overseas for a limited period of time can be a great way to bootstrap at a lower cost.

I sent an \n'informal' submission to a nice list of the top\njournals appropriate for the paper.  From one\nEditor in Chief of one of the best journals and\na chaired professor of computer science at one\nof the best universities I got back ""Neither I\nnor anyone on my board of editors has the \nmathematical background to review your paper.""\nThen I got a similar statement from another\nsuch person.  For one at MIT, I wrote him\nbackground tutorials for two weeks before he\ngave up.  Finally I found a journal that \nreally wanted the paper, but apparently\nin the end only the editor in chief reviewed\nthe paper and did so likely by walking it\naround his campus to the math department\nto check the math and then to the computer\nscience department to check the relevance\nfor computer science.<p>I had to conclude:  For the good future of\ncomputer science via math, the current crop of\nCS profs just didn't take the right courses\nin college and graduate school.<p>That's one side of the cultural divide.  For\nthe other side, (1) the math departments\nalways want to be as pure as possible and\nf'get about applied math and (2) in applied\nmath really don't like doing computer science.\nSome obscure math of relativity theory,\nmaybe, but mostly nothing as practical as\ncomputer science.<p>Of course, the big 'cross cutting' exception\nis the problem P versus NP, apparently first\ndiscovered in operations research (integer\nlinear programming, yes, in NP-complete),\nlater in computer science with SAT, and now\nat times taken seriously in math, e.g., at\nClay Math.<p>Here's a 'reason' for the math:  When we\nwrite software, we need something prior to\nthe software as, say, a 'specification', that\nis, saying what the software is to do.\nNow, where is computer science going to get\nthat specification?  A big source has been\njust to program what we know how to do\nat least in principle just manually.  After\nthat, computer science starts to lose it\nand drift into 'expert systems' (program,\nwith 'rules' and Forgy's RETE algorithm\nwhat an expert says), intuitive heuristics,\nand various kinds of brute-force fitting,\nmachine learning, neural networks, where \nbasically where we fit to the 'training' \ndata, test the fit with the rest of the\ndata, and stop when get a good fit.  So\nwe throw fitting methods at the data\nuntil something appears to stick.<p>We need more powerful means of getting that\nprior specification.  The advantage of\nmath is that it can start with a real problem,\nformulate it as a math problem, solve the\nmath problem, and then let the math solution\nand what is says we needed to do in manipulating\nthe data be the specification for the core\nsoftware.  E.g., if want to design an airplane\non a computer, then start with the applied\nmath of structural engineering, mechanical\nengineering, and aeronautical engineering, program\nthat applied math, and then design the plane.\nFor software to navigate a spacecraft to the\nouter planets, start with Newton's second\nlaw and law of gravity, get the differential\nequations of motion, get some numerical\nmeans of solution, and then program what the\nnumerical analysis says to do.<p>We need things solid and prior to the software\nto know what software to write, and basically\nthat is we need a math solution first.<p>For computing itself, as in monitoring, we\ncan call that a problem in statistics --\nmore applied math.<p>A lot in computer load balancing is\nsome serious applied math.  Actually\noptimal job scheduling is awash in\nNP-complete optimization problems.<p>Or, we used to have 'metaphysics'.  Then\nphysics became mathematical and made\nreal progress.  Basically the solid logical\nchain of correctness given by math theorems\nand proofs is just too darned hard to\ncompete with or, thus, ignore.",1368713394

These times are not like the past centuries over which Mathematics matured, our culture has changed and it's pervading on the progress of science, we now favor instant gratification, quick results, getting started easily, all accomodating short attention spans.<p>Of course, that says nothing of academic and niche languages; those will develop in every way possible. But as for what's to become popular, I think programming is bound to drop more specific syntax and become increasingly like natural language. This will be facilitated not only by our culture, but by advances in AI and natural language parsing. Much like the text editors themselves will tend to be increasingly facilitated by visual and audio input, and by intelligent computer assistance, in ways envisioned by Bret Victor, instead of going the way of the full control beasts that are vim and emacs.

I work in Ruby and I think it's a comfortable language to express ideas in. Scheme is also comfortable and I like it more conceptually, since it gives me this strange comfort of thinking ""well, if Scheme disappears forever, at least I have books that can help me make another one"", which I never think of languages like Ruby and Perl.<p>That's why I'm now finally learning Perl; I want to have a better perspective on what I actually like. If it turns out I'm a thousand times more comfortable with Perl than I'd ever be with a Lisp, then I guess I'll just learn to accept that I can't (or don't need to be able to) build the language I use from scratch.<p>It's just a weird feeling and I'd be curious to know if it's just me.

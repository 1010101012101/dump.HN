2138671,comment,2135968,2135968,0,0,s_jambo,,,"So I think the author could do with reading ""The long and the short of it"" by John Kay. Might help him understand how NNT did what he did.<p>The extra takeaway is that portfolio construction should be about finding investments that will probably all in the long term give an above inflation return (else what's the point) but, and this is the key. The investments should have low (ideally negative) correlation.<p>This means you look carefully at the underlying wealth generating machine you plan on investing in to check it's sound, and you consider scenarios to check you're actually diverse. A common strategy is to invest largely in an index of blue chips and have a risky pool of small caps. This hardly helps you at all since a recession is bad for both (and you're most likely to lose your job and need your savings when they're low).<p>So what does that give us:<p>* 55% short term US Gov Bonds<p>* 15% US Short term small caps<p>* 15% Precious metal ETF<p>* 15% Oil ETF.<p>First up, fundamentals - the USG is currently upto it's eyeballs in debt with no obvious political will to cut spending and raise taxes. The debt is all USD denominated so they may well inflate, but they could also default - either way bad for us. You might say 'but my liabilities are all in USD!' but personally if the standard of living in my country drops everyone around me being poor too is going to be scant comfort.<p>US short term small caps, the US has very pro business labour laws and taxes, it's got lots of well educated workers, whilst there has been a big run up in stocks lately (hello there QE) we're not trying to time the market and can clearly see where the fundamental wealth is generated.<p>Precious metal ETF - This ETF holds physical gold, silver, platinum and palladium in London and Zurich under custody of JP Morgan it charges a .6% fee. Precious metals have been a store of value for ages. Whilst there's been a big run up lately we're basically betting on bad news and there's obviously still the potential for more bad news. However since we don't hold it ourself we're hoping for bad but not catastrophic news.<p>Oil ETF - this ones based on short term oil futures and run by DB proshares. It seems to track oil better than some others although it will naturally under-perform the underlying commodity. Oil gets used everywhere. However simply holding oil is not owning a productive asset, this is a bet on future oil shortage not an investment. Personally I agree that shortages and inflation are likely to drive the price of oil higher but it's still a bet.<p>So that's individual fundamentals, now we look at correlation of these 4 assets. With 55% in a single bond fund any problem with that investment is very bad news. If the fund suffers from fraud, or some of the bonds default (or look like defaulting) you'll lose a large chunk of your savings.<p>Then we have exposure to the US. A significant slowdown in US economic activity is bad for the price of oil, bad for US taxes (and thus bond default chances) and very bad for US stocks. 85% of the portfolio could get creamed in this scenario. Theoretically GLTR could help us here but we also have to worry in this scenario if JP Morgan will survive. Even if they do other non-physical gold ETFs may not and will our ETF suddenly be under-priced due to perceived risk?<p>Whilst the concepts in the article are useful, as others have pointed out the portfolio seems to be an excellent example of how smart people can get tripped up in this environment.",1295952686

I've used C++ more than Java or C#, but it's not apparent to me how removing a language feature gives you more fine grained control.<p>The point isn't the loss of ""const"", it's that the only access you do have to a class-type object in C++/Java/C# is via its interface.<p>If you hold all of an object's current state in private data members, then the only way you can change that state -- even if you can see the object and it isn't const -- is via the interface functions provided. If as class designer you just happen not to provide any interface functions that mutate the object (no set_whatever() calls, no assignment operators, etc.) then your object becomes immutable by implication.<p>The finer control the GP mentioned probably refers to the way you can also choose to permit certain specific types of mutation, by providing a limited set of functionality in the interface rather than direct access to the underlying values.",1295952002

2138646,comment,2136744,2137069,0,0,brc,,,"I met someone once who purchased their place in Manhattan in November 2001.  At the time it couldn't be lived in, but they had faith that the city and the affected area would recover, which it has and I think they would have done well.  The thing with buying property anywhere is that it always seems like a bad deal, but that's because most people underestimate the propensity of governments to inflate currencies.  It doesn't take many years of high inflation for 'real' things like property to quickly rise in value.  And, purchasing at the top of bubbles notwithstanding, most of the time the land value underneath the property will stay pretty constant.  The house itself must be seen as a depreciating asset, but the land underneath will increase in value as long as the location is both desirable and economically growing (even better if it is above trend of the economy).<p>The problem with long-term renting is that, while you can theoretically engineer a better return by allocating as much as the principal component of a mortgage payment to one or more investment classes - most people don't.  The key benefits to owning a property are (IMO)\n* inflation hedge\n* forced savings (the principal component of your mortgage)\n* security of tenure\n* ability to modify the property as needs arise (like extending, remodelling, putting in network cables and server racks!)\n* access to further credit for other investments after equity is accumulated<p>These things vary country by country but the list is pretty much constant.  The most important thing is to not get carried away and only purchase what you can realistically afford, and to allocate as much money to paying down the mortgage in the first 5-10 years.<p>As for the yield equation - like value stocks, it's where the story is.  Most places at some point or another in their economic cycle will end up where the yield is very attractive, and that's the time to buy.  And, as a wise old italian investor who could buy and sell me many times over once told me (after I made my first mistake) : never sell your property.  Ever.  Buy right in the first place and keep forever.  If you find yourself hearing everyone say that real estate is a bad investment and see that rents are approaching mortgage payments, then buy as much as you can as quickly as you can.<p>The last 50 years has been the story of real estate growing in value.  This may or may not repeat over the next 50 years, because demographics, national politics and household formation have all changed in that time.  But inflation has been with us since the first clever financier decided to use paper money, and will stay with us while that is still the case.  If you purchase with your head and don't listen to anyone else, you'll do fine.<p>Finally - on the lowest economic growth - in Australia, in the USA - in a lot of places - the cheap credit of the '00s has led to an over-investment in residential property.  This takes credit and investment away from other parts of the economy where it could be used productively.  And it results in banks being dangerouslly over-exposed to residential property as an asset class.  I think this needs to be addressed, and pro-ownership govt programs(see FHMC in USA, First Homeowners grants in Aus) need to be dumped, despite the short term pain this would cause.  Because the economy isn't going to get going again until all the bad debts and bad investments are cleared up and swept away.",1295951308

2138610,comment,2135968,2135968,0,0,nika,,,"Stock picking does work.  You just have to pick stocks wisely.  Looking at the recommendations of ""financial experts"" is not stock picking.  What is the basis of these so-called ""experts""? The fact that they are stock salesman.  Do you let a used car dealer advise you on which used car to buy?  OR do you do your own research?<p>To further that analogy, this article is saying that because used car salesmen advise you to buy cars that benefit them more than you, you should just give up on picking a car and instead just drive whatever car you're assigned by some entity made up of used car salesman!  You may be driving a clunker, but at least you didn't have to think about it.<p>Stock picking works.  And not just for Warren Buffett.  Using someone else's ""hot tip"" is not stock picking. But analyzing the economics of the situation, both macro and micro, and the particulars of a given company will let you predict the return you'll get from a given company.<p>You know how to know whether an investment program is rational or not?  If it considers prices.  A given stock may be a fantastic company, but it may be over priced.<p>When you see people talking completely independant of any price analysis (as they do in this article and the comments) they are essentially debating on whether red or black is going to come up on the roulette wheel.  If you don't have the price of the asset as a core feature of any analysis you're just gambling.<p>Commodities are probably the best investment going right now, and for one simple reason: we are in the age of inflation.  So, not only will their prices be going up because of inflation, but because people will be piling into them to avoid inflation.<p>Don't take my word on it, though.  This is not a hot tip. Learn enough economics to be able to analyze the world.<p>Don't just buy into an investment ideology.",1295950149

I bought a property in 2001 for 20% less than the owner had paid in 1994.  Then, in about 2002/2003, it nearly doubled overnight and has never looked like going back. I foolishly sold a house in 2002 which was listed 2 years later and brought more than double the price I had bought it for.  It's again in a long slow slump (compared with inflation) - this is likely to persist for some years.  So your experience exactly covers the period of greatest growth in Brisbane.<p>I agree with you, though, current conditions make it risky.

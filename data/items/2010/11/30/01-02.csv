1952725,comment,1950695,1951974,0,0,jerf,,,"Allowing school choice is the single largest thing we could do to address the culture problem. That's my point. You're just handwaving on the culture problem, I'm giving you a step you can actually take to get there.<p>Second-order effects, second-order effects, second-order effects. When schools actually respond to more effort and it has some sort of visible effect on a child's education, more people will care. Incentives matter. The current system absorbs all of a parent's care and hammers it flat into the same basic mediocre product, suppressing it instead of amplifying it. A caring parent may do better than an uncaring one, but nowhere near <i>enough</i> better. Unfortunately, not investing a lot into the system at that point is perfectly locally rational.<p>How do you propose to fix the culture problem? The same-old, same-old first order solution where you appropriate some money and run some ads exhorting people to care more about schooling? New programs with the sweet, sweet intentions and nobody even examining the question of whether do anything because everybody's too busy feeling good about themselves? Paying people to care more, perhaps by incentivizing good grades? We've tried all those and more. It's not like ""it's a culture problem"" is exactly a new idea, and it's an easy one for ""the system"" to deal with because it does involve just what I said (money and government programs, for better and for worse not hard to push through), a solution very easy for the system to deploy. It won't work until schools actually magnify efforts instead of squashing them, and no amount of central mandating is going to get us there.<p>Cultural issues like schools aren't houses. That's first-order thinking. They're <i>life forms</i>, second order and so on. They react to your decisions, they do not passively consume them. With those sorts of systems it's actually quite common for the straightest path from here to there to be anything <i>but</i> simply striking out in what is most obviously the direction of the goal and pushing as hard as you can. If it were that easy, we wouldn't have a problem in the first place!",1291082230

To me, now, those codes are useless - so is the knowledge of how to build a nuclear bomb though as I don't have the resources to act on it.

We know netflix just switched away from akamai for video cdn to l3. Aside from scale, it's easy to guess one of the major reasons was price - akamai is one of the highest cost providers and L3 has been aggressively bidding on work. We also know that akamai has way more POPs or at least caching locations (2000+ is the pr) and is very well positioned to locally deliver on comcast. L3 video CDN in contrast is more in the dozen or two POP range, and several of those may not yet be up to the weight of netflix traffic. If comcast is going to have to handle a ton more national traffic themselves because netflix is saving money by switching to L3 it only makes sense for comcast to try to offset those costs by charging for transit.<p>What if I started CheapoStreamCo and started undercutting everyone in the business, but the only place I was on net was NYIIX.

Year after year they have sent vastly more in federal taxes than they ever get back in federal spending.""</i><p>So many seemingly educated Americans can't tell - or artfully avoid telling - the difference between state and federal taxation and spending.  Also, here's the dirty secret: people in other states don't really ""get back"" any of that federal money unless they work at federal facilities, including military bases, common in the states accused of getting more federal money than they give.  If they're <i>really</i> lucky, they might get that money at a remove or two if they work in lower-end service jobs near a military base.<p>But then, that whole thing is a strawman.  Some random idiot might be saying Californians are all lazy good-fer-nuthin's, but everyone else isn't talking about Californians, but an unsustainable state government.<p>""<i>California’s a basket case? The state has one of the highest living standards in the country...</i>""<p>I'm rather horribly reminded of global warming ""skeptics"" who hoot every time it snows.",1291079119

To the degree that such security works its often due to the lack of serious threats and the ubiquity of individual discretion. As more institutions with serious resources and an anti-secrecy agenda come into existence and grow in stature and capability this comfy situation will likely devolve. In the near term that might lead to a lot of very unhealthy reactionary responses. More NDAs, more security, police state tactics being deployed throughout the tech industry (as an example). We can look to the responses of the RIAA/MPAA to modern communication technology as a yard stick for the way the typical corporate mind might react to the onslaught of ""openness"" that wikileaks and its ilk will cause.<p>Similarly, how will government respond? We see the sort of ridiculousness that we already have to put up with (TSA pat-downs, porno-scanners, liquid limitations, other security theater), what new travails will the public have to put up with?",1291079049

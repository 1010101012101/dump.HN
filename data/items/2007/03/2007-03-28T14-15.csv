There's a thrill that comes when people enthusiastically approve of your work.  Also I know my site will be higher quality and more valuable if it renders in safari.  The more valuable my site is, the more likely I will be able to make money off of it.<p>Come up with a list for the Google job, and see how it compares.  For me personally, both sound good.",1175093490

Is my main discouragement.  I'm 28 and have been out of school for 6 years.<p>13.  Uncertainty interferes a little.  
I have a comfortable , quiet apartment and I'd be risking that on a startup.  This obstactle isn't hard to overcome, though.<p>Other comments on the essay<p>2.  Too inexperienced: In my case, being too inexperienced meant that the idea of a startup didn't even occur to me.  This advice might have helped, but I probably wasn't listening.<p>
12.  Need for Structure:
While some people do seem to have a built-in need for structure, sometimes that structure can be ""There Is No Structure.""  I'd say:<p>The problems appear when the expected structure is differs from what actually exists.  <p>Employees will stagnate in what feels like a structured environment if they are given no instruction.  However, if it's clear from the start that no structure will be provided, they won't waste time waiting.  On the other side, managers may get upset if employees don't follow policy with military precision, despite the fact that military structure hasn't been provided and the relevant policy is 30 pages deep in a handbook no one has read in 2 years.  The manager can either figure out how to include military drilling, or accept that degree of structure is unworkable.<p>My impression of Y Combinator is that it's fairly clear early on how much structure is provided (or not provided).

That book was Practical Cryptography, and now it's Cryptography Engineering.</i><p>Very nice! Since I wanted a book which also explains the implementation details of various cryptography algorithms, I asked my coworker if he knew one (I bought Kryptographie (Amazon.de: <a href=""http://bit.ly/cxxAQT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/cxxAQT</a>), which didn't explain anything about implementations, but is a good read for other various reasons). He recommended me Applied Cryptography and I was going to order it. This was yesterday. Today I read your tweet (<a href=""http://twitter.com/tqbf/status/8879609339"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/tqbf/status/8879609339</a>) and was going to have a look at Practical Cryptography.

Now they've improved it to be merely mediocre, but it still doesn't preload more than the next image, and you have to click through to the standard photo page to see anything else.<p>I think they're just obstinate -- the standard pages haven't really changed since maybe 2004. Besides, Flickr was never about looking at images -- it was originally a MMUD, and it still basically is -- there was a moment of truth back in ~2005 when the site was invaded by users from the U.A.E. mass-spamming groups and pools in a huge clusterfuck, and the site encouraged that rather than reject them.

505007,comment,504969,504969,0,0,smakz,,,"It's actually pretty astonishing to me how many web sites don't charge anything. It reminds me of how Bill Gates gloats about the early days of MS how there was this huge hobbyist scene in software and very few were getting paid (not sure how accurate that really is but it seems similar to what I see today).<p>Developers of start ups should get used to the idea that it's OK to charge people for a service you provide. It provides psychological incentives to the buyers that they are buying something and therefore are entitled to a real level of service, and it provides real cash to the founders to properly grow the business.<p>Not to mention, it is trivially easy to start charging people these days, with services like Amazon FPS.<p>I really thought back in 2000 that companies based around the 'advertising will pay for everything' model would have learned their lesson, but clearly it's not the case.",1236301139

The current US economy doesn't work that way.<p>> Meaning every immigrant and his family ... pay taxes etc<p>Folks who don't make more than median wage don't pay significant taxes.  In fact, they're a net-loss, tax-wise.<p>> what about all the other people that would not qualify for h-1b but are still very skilled and/or ambitious?<p>Good question.",1236300885

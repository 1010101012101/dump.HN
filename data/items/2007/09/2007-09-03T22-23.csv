This is what I have done at least.<p>I thought my system would develop revenue right away, but the number of sign ups it took to create a paying customer cost more then what I could afford and natural search traffic was just not coming fast enough.  <p>So I gave it away free so I could figure out the money part later.  Not to mention the system wasn't very mature, it needed a revision to bring the quality up and then what seemed like months of bug fixing.<p>Out of my biding my time, putting out incremental improvements, and building good repore with the users I have discovered instead of putting out a generic product, success will come from taloring very specific products out of my generic product.  Using my application as sort of a platform of generic parts to build a system for a particular market.  <p>Having kids, wife, things have still worked out fine. ",1188860125

It's a big incentive to me that they don't charge merchants anything, but the 20% increase in sales you saw is huge, so I guess I'll bite the bullet and get a real merchant account. I know that this has come up before on news.yc, but who are you using for payment processing?",1188859531

For example, they already seem to use interstitials and in-page css popups to get around pop-up blockers.<p>In fact, maybe a great startup could be to create technologies that let ad networks get around ad block software.",1188859331
49795,comment,49787,49787,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"Put it this way.  You are not going to see an increase in sales by exclusively going with Google Checkout.  Given that managing credit card information isn't that difficult (I am setting it up again for the umpteenth time tonight), why not just bite the bullet and manage it all yourself.  That way, you can run experiments to converge on an optimal checkout process.<p>Beyond that, it is hard to say exactly how much you will be hurt.  A few years ago a site I was working on moved from exclusively PayPal to an on-site form, and sales increased instantly about 20% and then over 100% after tweaking of checkout process.  That was back when PayPal forced you to create a PayPal account, which I believe Google does now.  ",1188859074

Google has anti-competitively good pricing; it's free for the seller through 2008.<p>Perhaps there is something more professional seeming about an authorize.net style merchant account, but it's easier for us if we don't have to handle any credit card information. How much does using Google Checkout hurt us?",1188858360

Jones, the coach, drew up a play that looked something like this white board.  Larry Bird erased the board with his hand and said, ""Get me the ball.""  They got him the ball.  He shot.  They won.<p>Sometimes you just gotta code like Larry Bird.

Both address the same pain of creating online pages without having to write code.<p>2. Most people creating websites inevitably have to create some kind of form on their website. <p>3. The combined company's services is probably much more appealing to a buyer (maybe some online store manager) than two individual form and web page creation companies.<p>Any thoughts ?<p>Thanks

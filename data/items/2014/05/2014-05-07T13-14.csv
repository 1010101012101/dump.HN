This makes it natural for movies to get rated very highly when they are first released. That&#x27;s just natural.<p>If you forced people to photograph their ticket stub, I believe this could make the problem worse: mainly people who particularly loved the movie (or thought it was significantly worthy of comment) would be motivated enough to do that. You&#x27;ll just collect the IMdB&#x27;s 10s and 1s.<p>I know many people use the IMdB for their own record-keeping. These people would stop doing that if there was an administrative barrier that made it less convenient than a paper equivalent, e.g. writing in an address book. I strongly believe this makes their votes neutral/genuine compared to other survey methods.",1399471196

There is a reason your office doesn&#x27;t use consumer Internet, and that a 1.4 Mbps T1 costs $400/month, while low-end 6 Mbps DSL costs $30/month -- 4x bandwidth for <10% of the cost, what a deal!<p>I shouldn&#x27;t have to say this on Hacker News, but what you pay ISPs for is quality of service and support.

Seems like a clever loophole to increase the number of visas, while casting it as a benevolent change that makes it easier to retain talent.<p>I&#x27;m not a big fan of letting employers make immigration decisions. There&#x27;s too much of an incentive to try to get low cost labor, which subsidizes stupid business practices. Sure, employers could invest in automation and smarter operating procedures, or we can just plug the hole as cheaply as possible.<p>H1Bs are unlikely to be big entrepreneurial catalysts because they are effectively tied to their employer and in a tricky legal framework. Honestly - I thought that was the whole point of the visa. And not to too much of a snob here, but the three immigrants mentioned in the Fortune 500 were all graduates of elite american universities (Andy Grove - Berkeley, Jerry Yang, Sergey - Stanford), which proves mostly nothing about the visa program.<p>I think a much better policy for America is to allow the top 50-100 universities by US News to determine who is qualified to enter. those measures are not perfect, but it is rate-limited by the size of their degree programs and they have an incentive to keep the quality of admitted applicants high.",1399470845

It&#x27;s not tell smart people they are too stupid to do crypto (which is a lot of programmers&#x27; knee-jerk reaction to being accused of ignorance on any technical topic), it&#x27;s merely to point out that there&#x27;s a lot of existing knowledge out there about crypto, and if you don&#x27;t go learn about it first then your contribution will almost certainly be of negative value.<p>It&#x27;s not meant to say don&#x27;t contribute to OpenSSL or one of its competing libraries, it&#x27;s meant to say that you need to be grounded in the state of the art and have peer review in order to produce a solid cryptography product.",1399470840

Instead of throwing third-hand information around like everybody does in these threads, I went to the source to criticize its methodology.<p>The book, as a whole, is handwaving. It&#x27;s based on two fundamentally flawed premises:<p>1) That the internet and mobile booms are unrelated to deregulation and should not be factored into the analysis. Of course, that&#x27;s ludicrous. For decades up to the mid-1990&#x27;s, telephone service was an industry with steady demand growing based on population growth. Then the internet happened, and mobile happened, and demand skyrocketed. At a basic economic level, why should we not, then, expect: 1) providers of the infrastructure underlying those boom industries to profit more after than they did before? 2) providers of the infrastructure underlying those boom industries to depreciate infrastructure and invest in new infrastructure faster than before?<p>The $200 billion figure is fundamentally rooted in assuming that the answers to those two questions should be &quot;no.&quot;<p>2) That 1970&#x27;s-style rate-regulation doesn&#x27;t have an adverse impact on capital investment. If companies can make 30% returns investing in Twitter and 10% returns investing in laying fiber, then the money will go where the returns are.

7710091,comment,7708858,7708858,1,0,hackuser,,,"I know ISPs attract little sympathy and HN readers naturally do sympathize with startups and smaller organizations (as do I), but consider:<p>In open markets a seller charges what the market will bear in order to maximize profit. And of course it benefits society because resources are allocated efficiently, i.e. to those with the greatest demand for them (those willing to pay the most). Why should this market be any different? I&#x27;d expect that any business, discovering they had an asset someone would pay for, would charge as much as they could for it. There is nothing dirty or underhanded about it, even if it challenges the status quo we all are accustomed to (or the notion that everything on the Internet is free). And it&#x27;s not like big ISPs are stomping widows and orphan children -- Netflix, for all its victimhood, can stand up for itself and I&#x27;m sure maximizes its profit wherever possible. (It may be different for startups.)<p>I don&#x27;t want to be absolutist about it, but what I said is a factor. Other factors are that the ISPs benefit from public goods such as local monopolies, and benefit from all the innovation that created the Internet and the services that their customers are paying them for, so they do owe something to maintaining that ecosystem.<p>And the clear solution, as has been said before here, is customers paying for metered bandwidth, and also for latency or other SLAs if they want them (which long has been common for businesses ISPs) -- why should someone who mostly uses email want to pay for the same latency that a Netflix customer or gamer needs?",1399470454

I don&#x27;t any more, for example (and I don&#x27;t use Windows any more either). The developers of these things are in consequence similarly young and have not yet learned good sense in programming (I include myself in that category, though I reckon the PortableApps.com Launcher to contain best-of-class engineer in the portable software space---five years later, at age 22, I am surprisingly unashamed of it, though now I would write it in Rust; I should try that one of these years).",1399468897

In this way, Go is actually more robust with respect to whitespace than almost any other language.<p>Note that in languages that don&#x27;t mandate the open brace be on the same line as the code that opens the new scope, this can happen during a merge:<p><pre><code>  // original code\n  if (foo) \n  {\n       printf(&quot;foo is true!&quot;)\n  }\n\n  // after the merge\n  if (foo)\n      someFunction()\n  {\n      printf(&quot;foo is true!&quot;)\n  }\n</code></pre>\nNow this code will always print &quot;foo is true!&quot;.  Because Go requires the open brace to be on the same line as the if, this type of bug is impossible in Go.<p>Gofmt will never change the behavior of your code, so you don&#x27;t have to &quot;worry&quot; about what it will do.  It only makes cosmetic changes to code, never functional.",1399468747

Every single person there from management on down sincerely believed the drug candidates they were identifying and working on might be cures one day. The oncology drug development process in a strange way mirrors the experience cancer patients themselves (and I speak from experience-- lost my dad to pancreatic cancer when I was just starting out). You have these really good days, where you have data that says you might be on to something. That things are looking up. Maybe this time it will be different! One in a million chance! And you have those bad days, where it all seems to be falling apart. All the while through the ups and downs you know in the back of your mind that inevitably (well something like 98% of the time anyway), the data from the first clinical trials will come back, and the drug you thought was going to change the world isn&#x27;t any better than anything else. Maybe if you get really lucky, the drug adds 3 months to patients&#x27; lives so it&#x27;s not a total failure.<p>So you pick yourself up after 5 - 8 years of work, and start all over at the beginning in the hopes that <i>this time</i> will be different. That is the reality of cancer drug development in a pharmaceutical company. There is no smoke-filled room where the managers say, &quot;oh no, we can&#x27;t pursue <i>that</i> it might cure people!&quot;. Even if people <i>were</i> so warped as to think that way, you can comfort yourself in knowing that biologists are so ignorant of the basics of cancer, they wouldn&#x27;t know how to distinguish a cure for a mere treatment if they wanted.<p>The reality is that cancer is biologically complex and ferociously difficult to cure. People seem to often use the &quot;war&quot; analogy (as in &quot;the war on cancer&quot;). If it&#x27;s a war, we&#x27;re still using pointed sticks and rocks and cancer has intercontinental ballistic missiles, special forces, and  fighter jets.

Read page 210-223, especially page 222.<p>The number is calculated by starting from the premise that telecom companies should be regulated as utilities, and make regulated returns on their investment. It also starts from the premise that the price of features should be proportional to their cost.<p>From that premise, it computes $103 billion as the &quot;excess profits&quot; when the telcos are compared to other utilities. Another $78 billion is chalked up to &quot;excessive depreciation.&quot; This, in turn, is based on a calculation rooted in &quot;[a]ssuming that depreciation rates should have remained constant after divestiture.&quot; (Page 220). Of course the assumption that the depreciation rate should have remained constant before and after the internet boom is ridiculous. Another $25-50 billion is &quot;cross-subsidization overcharging for long distance, DSL, and wireless.&quot; This estimate is based on the claim that the telcos added charges to phone bills that should have been accounted as costs to non-regulated services.<p>None of this amounts to getting a direct subsidy or even a direct tax break in return for building fiber. The whole point of the 1996 changes in the law was deregulation of the industry. The whole idea was that deregulation of the industry would lead to higher capital investment, <i>which it did</i> (just not in the areas people expected at the time). Nobody hid the ball on the fact that the 1996 law was about deregulation--everyone referred to it as such. Well, in a deregulated industry, if a company raises prices, we don&#x27;t call that &quot;excess profits.&quot; If they cross-subsidize their business lines, we don&#x27;t call that &quot;excess profits.&quot;<p>Did the telcos make a ton of money between 1996-present?

So, the CEO can make an impact by choosing people, understanding their motives, skills and the relationships between them, and giving them a chance to shine.<p>When a new president is elected, and imposes policies he came up with in opposition without access to treasury data and expert advice, something is wrong. Shame it happens every time. Big company CEOs are trying to make money, not get re-elected, so they should manage not do.",1399467831

More subtly, it expresses the idea that women are probably not worth hiring. Even more subtle is its message that gender-specific hiring is acceptable. Klout outdoes itself in undermining the clause, common in many hiring documents, that the company &quot;will not discriminate on the basis of race, color, ethnic origin, national origin, creed, religion, political belief, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, or age&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t know that this can be expanded to characterize the overall culture of the tech/startup sector – I&#x27;ve never observed it (thought it does have a reputation for misogyny). In any event, the author&#x27;s intent is  to respond to the &quot;bro&quot; discourse that actual employers and companies included in their public-facing materials, by satirizing it with similar language.",1399467788

The first version of the API is still being developed but would be a pretty similar mapping of the current feature set. Notable power of the API: paging indefinitely through the search results, searching multiple sites at once, clustering of multiple instances on VPSs, queueing of searches to pop the results back later, POST and GET requests (so you could bookmark searches).<p>Edit: for the API, also considering a feature to disable AJAX support for scraping per each request.

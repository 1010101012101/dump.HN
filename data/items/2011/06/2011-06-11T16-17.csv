It's so sad to see so many other companies compromise when you get such a great RoI on little investments. Most sites have shopping carts that expire after a couple of minutes. Amazon's shopping cart lasts effectively forever though. The result is a better user experience at a modest cost of engineering and database resources.

2644268,comment,2643868,2644225,2,0,orijing,,,"That's mostly true, but there's still the latency benefits of physical proximity. For example, just for an electric signal to travel 6000km across the country, it will take t=6000km/v where v=c/n (c = speed of light, 3e8 m/s and n = refractive index of fiber, 1.62). So it'll take 32.4 ms just to send a packet across the states, and another 32.4 ms to receive one back. This doesn't even take into effect the latency from the routers in the way, and other things like that your message doesn't go in a completely straight path.<p>So latency is really important if you're doing something like playing a real time game. 32ms is basically a single frame if you're playing at 30 fps.

2644197,comment,2639456,2642329,4,0,troutwine,,,"> But how much will forcing those infrastructure and cultural and societal changes cost NOW, versus letting them happen naturally and gradually the same way we switched from wood to coal to petroleum and from muscle to steam to electricity?<p>I believe you might profitably examine your implicit assumptions about what constitutes ""natural"" and ""gradual"" adaptation of industry. As has been pointed out by another commenter, the progression has not been as linear as you have proposed: many industries in the world _still_ use wood as fuel, hence my prior deforestation comment. (Note that farmed wood promotes a monoculture ecosystem, effectively declaring creatures dependent on the prior heterogeneous environment unimportant.) Western countries have tended, historically speaking, to incentivise new industrial developments. Often this was done at the precipice of a disaster and done at great cost: much less money and life might have been spent had the work been gradual.<p>> Extremely simple illustration: Do you think people in Florida will be living 10 feet under water in 100 years? No, they will move before then. But they don't have to move now, so why force them?<p>Consider the crushing burden of mass migration, the vast human cost. There have been several such in this century already; you may go to visit them and learn why _gradual_ migration is vastly preferable. Further, do not misunderstand me: I am not advocating that all residents of Florida move at one time; this change should happen gradually as a part of a prepared plan. Such plans are difficult to construct when individuals such as yourself are content to kick the can down the road and let the future sort it out. Human civilizations adapt necessarily to their surroundings; done consciously such adaptations need not be the source of untellable human suffering.<p>> Similarly, do you think we'll all be driving gas-guzzling SUVs in 100 years? Hell no. Oil just won't last that long, and our car culture will have died or switched to electric (or nuclear, or secret ooze) long before then anyway.<p>Consider the economic implications of ""running dry"". So much of the United State's infrastructure carries the implicit assumption of cheap gasoline and diesel that to suddenly (meaning the sudden increased cost over the span of a decade, say) go without would cause significant harm to our economy and world standing, relative to those nations that are preparing. Again, I stress _gradual_ change, but such change must be sustained by a willingness to tackle the problem directly and _not_ simply be willing to let the future work things out. Surely they will, but at greater expense than we who now decide the course of the world can manage.<p>> So why force the issue?<p>I hope I have made myself clear. If not: the necessary adaptations of human civilization in many areas will be extensive, expensive and time consuming. We can mitigate the second concern by performing those adaptations _before_ they are vital. Consider that the upgrade of infrastructure as a part of regular maintenance cycles is more tenable than sudden overhaul. We need only come to an agreement on the way in which we will upgrade; this is impossible when influential individuals deny the basic premise or assert that the future will somehow more efficiently solve our problems though they be exacerbated by the passage of time.<p>> I guess I'm just not seeing the urgency here.<p>I believe the urgency is largely manufactured by a news media predicated on the spread of unease, over zealous Chicken Littles and anti-reactionary misinformation. We have a problem _now_. Our technological sophistication is such that we can prepare ourselves for this problem without the death or displacement of billions. What little urgency does actually exist at this point does so because the changes that must be made cannot be made fifteen years out; a period of fifty to seventy-five years, depending on global economy, is more reasonable. Cuts in significantly to your hypothetical one-hundred years, no?<p>> And whatever urgency there is, doesn't seem to be fixable in the short term.<p>No, it is not. This is why it is preferable to begin the process of adaptation before it is a matter of dire consequence.<p>> Ocean levels will rise. They already have. So let's focus on mitigation rather than the already failed task of prevention.<p>I believe you read my original statement with a biased eye. We must necessarily adapt--by the time we began to notice the effect our habits had on the global climate it was likely too late to reverse the process. That said, we would do well to live up to our self-given taxonomic title and not exacerbate the problem. It looks like we will continue, especially as developing countries fire up their own furnaces.",1307808470

2644193,comment,2643951,2644076,2,0,Silhouette,,,"Do most people not care, or are they simply unaware of what they are giving up and the real impliciations of the social web?<p>For example, we all know Facebook is huge, and many people give up all sorts of personal data to the company running it. And yet, on several recent occasions when Facebook have made changes that they were demonstrably technically capable of making and arguably within their legal rights to make, but which diminished the privacy of their users, the outcry from the user base was substantial and in some cases they gave up and essentially reverted the changes.<p>That was basically a PR/marketing move by Facebook: when you rely on critical mass of users in the way they do, you can't afford to upset people <i>en masse</i> so that they start to drift away to a rival service. It wasn't forced on them for technical reasons, and relatively few countries raised significant legal concerns about the privacy implications.<p>I wonder whether users would be similarly upset if they realised how much of their ""private"" data has been shared with other parties over the years, and where it has wound up, and how many people have wound up defrauded/stalked/otherwise genuinely damaged as a result. I think there's an element of ""It can't happen to me"" at work here, and my biggest worry is that as we've seen recently with organisations like Sony, corporate complacency and denial are no substitute for real security and privacy protection when Bad People decide to come after you.<p>[Edit: I would also be interested in proper studies if anyone has links, but only if their methodology is sound. I am reminded of the ""study"" last year about attitudes to the virtual strip search machines at airports, where apparently 90% of people in my country said they supported them. When asked with different wording in another study, not conducted by an organisation with ties to making the machines in question, it turned out that many of those people really meant that they preferred the hands-off abuse of the machines to being physically abused during an aggressive pat-down, which isn't the same thing at all. Privacy studies are all about how you phrase the question, and those with vested interests are very good at that sort of thing.]",1307808394

You know, not to work out, but to breathe fresh morning air for once. To enjoy the sound of birds. Riding your bike, or walking, is exactly what that nice quite of yours is recommending.<p>No. I just needed to pull out some example. There are some situations in which driving is more pleasant than walking -- consider someone who works at a ski resort in the mountains, in the winter -- and situations in which walking is more pleasant than driving.

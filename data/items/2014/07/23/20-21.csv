E.g., how many engineers do you put on infrastructure versus Xbox? The answer isn&#x27;t obvious because you can&#x27;t directly measure the profitability of the infrastructure team. When teams are small (such as in startups) the leader can kind of guess this stuff, and successful leaders do it well, while bad ones go out of business. Some companies try create internal markets to allocate capital but that has problems too, because it causes some level of friction in the process of how capital is internally allocated.<p>This is why I think Ycombinator&#x27;s model is potentially very useful. Instead of a monolithic structure where capital is essentially moved between divisions based on the judgment of a single person (the CEO), there is a syndicate of companies which tend to produce goods that the others need, while still maintaining a market so that prices can be established and used as a guide for which projects should receive more (or less) capital.",1406148902

I suspect this because of ChuckFrank&#x27;s comment which identifies problems and proposes solutions, as all we hackertypes instinctively do.<p>The thing is, when they say:<p>>  create a &#x27;nomination&#x27;, &#x27;verification&#x27; and &#x27;implementation&#x27; process with their “originators,” “nominators,” “aggregators,” “screeners,” and “encountering agencies.”<p>And we all reel in horror at how bad this is procedurally, we must remember that they are not doing this to determine terrorists. They are doing this because if they do put people on lists and need to watch them (for whatever reason), and end up being very wrong, they need to diffuse the damage to organization level (which cannot be held accountable) instead of individuals.<p>In other words, its not about codifying who is a suspected and actual terrorist. It&#x27;s about internal damage control so that no individual can be blamed when something goes wrong. I&#x27;m not sure the US Gov is <i>entirely</i> at fault here, at least not in a actually-tring-to-be-sinister sense.

8076890,comment,8076221,8076785,8,0,anigbrowl,,,"Pulling individual sentences out of their context tends to be misleading. Editing the cherry-picked parts is virtually guaranteed to be misleading.<p>Here, you omitted the phrase &#x27;known terrorist&#x27; from the middle of the sentence you quote on page 22. This totally changes the meaning of the quoted sentence. Also, you chose not to include the following sentence which described how such a presumption could be overcome if the investigative body in question had credible information to the contrary. Finally, you overlooked the fact that &#x27;nominators&#x27; in this context refers to other government agencies, relying on existing procedures for designation of someone as a &#x27;known terrorist&#x27;, and that said procedures form the due process in question. The point of this is to avoid bureaucratic duplication and waste. If the FBI sends the NCTC someone&#x27;s bio and states them to be a known terrorist (based on facts in said bio), then it&#x27;s entirely reasonable for the NCTC to take the FBI&#x27;s information at face value unless it receives information to the contrary.<p>Such designation is presumptively valid in that situation because the FBI itself  is subject to law. If different agencies of the executive branch are required to reject each others&#x27; conclusions by default and investigate every assertion <i>de novo</i> the outcome would be ontological paralysis. At such time as someone is detained and charged with terrorist the matter is handed over to the judicial branch, where a court serves the role of finder of fact.

8076870,comment,8075674,8075674,3,0,josephpmay,,,"I have an interesting hypothesis: firm inefficiency leads to greater income inequality.<p>Think about it. Generally, smaller, newer firms are more efficient than older, larger firms.  Greater firm inefficiency means that more older firms will be replaced by newer firms (whether by market position or outright bankruptcy). Average consumers can only invest in older, established firms, and, indeed, many 401k&#x27;s are tied-up in stocks of 50+ year old companies. Millionaires, however, by being certified investors, can invest in many startups, a small portion of which will eventually become large, established firms in the future. This causes the rich to gain money, and others to loose it.<p>Let me give a (contrived) example. Let&#x27;s say you wanted to invest in a car company in 2005. If you were an average investor, you may have put your money in (old) GM, whose stock is now worthless. If you were a billionaire, you could have split your money between Tesla, ZAP, and Project Better Place. ZAP and PBP are now defunct, but you would have made a boatload of money off of Tesla.",1406148498

Since WWII every major military event or war has been seen by that crowd as a sign that &quot;it is the hour of the time,&quot; 9/11 certainly included. The fact that it happened right about at the millennium added even more fuel to the fire.<p>Throughout history leaders have often squandered the wealth of their kingdoms on crazy religious crusades, and being either rich or politically powerful does not exclude one from believing in things that are completely bat-guano insane.<p>It&#x27;s one of the only explanations for Iraq that really makes sense to me. Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11 and it would have been far cheaper to develop better oil drilling technology here at home than to invade for oil. The war cost more than developing the entire Bakken play.

This is not an easy task.<p>This is why they create a &#x27;nomination&#x27;, &#x27;verification&#x27; and &#x27;implementation&#x27; process with their “originators,” “nominators,” “aggregators,” “screeners,” and “encountering agencies.”<p>But the problem comes down to the actual facts. This document does a terrible job of separating a process design - First a candidate gets originated by an originator, who passes that said candidate on to a nominator, etc - from the basic factual requirements needed to become listed as a suspected (or actual) terrorist. (Though the latter would seem easier to determine.)<p>What is really needed is a clear set of factually determined checks to show that someone is indeed a suspected terrorist. Not a process design that creates a structure towards watch list inclusion.<p>In design this is often a problem. It&#x27;s a very common mistake. Teams, Companies, Professionals design a process, but not the necessary, required steps - and everything just gets lost in that process, especially when everything takes place according to the plan.<p>Here&#x27;s what the watch list needs. A list that triggers inclusion.<p>If a appears to have done x, y or z, a get&#x27;s &quot;originated.&quot; If x, y, and z are verified, a gets nominated. At this point counter rationales for x, y and z must be presented to excuse the suggestion of terrorism when there is none. Etc.<p>What is important are the verifiable X, Y and Z actions. That&#x27;s what a document of this type should present.<p>Now I know that the response is that if people are told how they get onto a watchlist, they will try to avoid those tasks while maintaining their terrorist agenda, thereby avoiding being categorized as a suspect.<p>But isn&#x27;t that the point, don&#x27;t we want people to not engage in pre-terrorist activity, like going to a training camp in Afghanistan, or sending money to organizations who have actively taken responsibility for civilian bombings. Isn&#x27;t that the point?<p>Getting people to be classified as suspected terrorists is not what a watchlist should be about. A watchlist should be about commonly agreed upon actions that as a society we do not support, and we can change our minds about what we do and do not support over time.<p>Then the watchlist can be public, those on the watchlist can be public, their reason for being on the watchlist can be public and we can decide - together- who should and should not be on a watchlist.<p>We already do it with criminals. Why is this process any different?<p>Criminals can be just as deadly and corrupting to our society, but yet we&#x27;ve figured out a way (to some degree) to deal with them. We should be able to do the same with Terrorists.<p>A new process is possible, one that will in fact make us, and everyone safer. This method is not that process.

Even then, you could only port numbers between carriers with facilities in the same area/local code.  It&#x27;s only been in the past six years or so that nationwide, wireless number porting has been a reliable thing and only really because cellular systems in the States have grown so large with so many regional ratecenter connections.

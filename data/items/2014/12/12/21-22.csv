I just think it&#x27;s not relevant to TPB at all, and that the linking of the two things is a giant exercise in changing-the-subject.<p>(1) Destroy old business model.<p>(2) ... hand wavey magic happens here ...<p>(3) Utopia!<p>I question #2 categorically. The magic never comes.<p>Historically people have to struggle to be compensated fairly for their work. It was true for labor in the late 19th century, it&#x27;s true for Chinese sweatshop workers, and it&#x27;s true for content creators. A rising tide does not automatically lift all boats, and models of fair labor compensation do not appear without a struggle.<p>Let&#x27;s be totally clear here. I see the piracy issue <i>as an issue of labor fairness vs. labor exploitation.</i><p>If <i>programmers</i> were the ones on the chopping block, none of you people would be talking like this. You&#x27;d all be up in arms and talking about what can be done. This is entitled elitism of the first order; only <i>some</i> professions are entitled to compensation or for their wishes about how their works are used to be respected.<p>Why is it that there are a million hackers working on new alternatives to The Pirate Bay, yet I see almost nobody working on new ways for authors, musicians, and artists to connect directly with their audiences?<p>TPB doesn&#x27;t connect musician to audience -- it <i>distances</i> musician from audience even more than the record companies ever did! Piracy is the ultimate in passive consumerism. It&#x27;s consumerism so passive there isn&#x27;t even a twice-removed economic connection. There&#x27;s no connection at all. You -- the viewer or listener -- might as well not even exist.<p>If the goal is to get the scummy record companies out of the loop, why aren&#x27;t hackers <i>working on that?</i> Why doesn&#x27;t somebody create a distributed, censorship-resistant medium for people to publish creative work that incorporates a transparent and direct-to-the-creator Bitcoin-based mechanism for payment? I&#x27;m not even talking about DRM, which I agree doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m talking about a simple mechanism. On TPB, Popcorn Time, and any number of these other things, I don&#x27;t even see a way to pay the artists if I want to. There&#x27;s not even a &quot;tip&quot; functionality. I think the intent is clear from the absence of anything like that in the design.<p>This is about <i>free</i>, not freedom. You&#x27;re appropriating a bunch of high-minded rhetoric, but the reality is you&#x27;re just cheapskates who want free labor.<p>I&#x27;ll reserve my respect for people who actually <i>make things of their own</i> and put them out there to advance the cause of freedom-- people like Linus, or DJB, or pretty much every original OSS software author out there.",1418421480

If there&#x27;s a convincing argument that a monolithic kernel can be made secure, I haven&#x27;t seen it. Device drivers are simply too dangerous to be running in kernel space, for example, along with much of the rest of what we usually get in the kernel (filesystems, TCP and UDP stacks, etc).<p>No binary should ever be run without the kernel imposing an appropriately restrictive set of policies on what it can do.<p>And there needs to be more sophistication in approaching how applications work. For example, a good argument can be made that binaries shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to open their own file handles under most conditions. Your word processor shouldn&#x27;t be the one putting up an open dialog and opening anything you point to in your directory tree because that&#x27;s how it can be talked into dumping your entire home directory to a foreign server. It should have to ask the OS to put that dialog up, and then accept the file handle(s) it&#x27;s handed by the OS.<p>And then there are protocols that are broken by design, which we haven&#x27;t even touched on.<p>Everything, from top to bottom, needs to be rewritten with security in mind.

8742925,comment,8740917,8740917,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Cynicism alert. The purpose of widespread college education is socioeconomic. People simply wouldn&#x27;t throw so much money and time after this game (starting, in some places, with <i>preschool</i> admissions, and often totaling near the half-million mark) if it weren&#x27;t. The leaders of our society don&#x27;t value culture or education that much; they do value tradition, pedigree, and position. Our colleges actually do a pretty good job of educating people who want to learn, but that&#x27;s a tertiary purpose to the socioeconomic one that justifies tuitions at $50,000 per year instead of, say, $5,000.<p><i>The so-called party pathway through college is an all-encompassing lifestyle characterized by virtually nonstop socializing, often on the male-controlled turf of fraternity houses. Substance abuse and sexual assault are common consequences.</i><p>College is about protecting the young from an unforgiving society, by handling indiscretions (e.g. substance abuse) with the kid gloves, and protecting their early careers by giving them something close to <i>the best possible work experience</i> they can have at a given age.<p>A 30-year-old has fits and starts in his career and at least one job that took a painful. A 22-year-old coming out of college has an almost unblemished record. A mediocre GPA can be interpreted as evidence of being social, and while English majors might not place as well as CS majors, literature provides much more interesting conversation than a terminal middle-management position. <i>That</i> is what college achieves. It gets you 4 years into adulthood with a very low risk of having to explain yourself.<p>Also, we gripe about ageism afflicting the late-career not-that-old, but there&#x27;s also a strong ageism directed at young adult men. The truth about <i>most</i> 17- to 23-year-old males... is that society doesn&#x27;t like &#x27;em too much. The social hierarchy is high-status men > high-status women > low-status women > low-status men. (That&#x27;s part of why gender debates around social justice are so complicated; women get screwed on upside and men get screwed on downside.) Additionally, age and social status are correlated in men, generally upward until old age. Except for wealthy heirs, young men are seen as garbage until they prove themselves. (I&#x27;m not saying that this is right; it&#x27;s clearly not.) College isn&#x27;t just about making teenage men acceptable for society, but also protecting them during a time in which many people are predisposed to hate them, thinking of them as horny, reckless, socially inept monsters.<p>Traditionally, college was to protect young men from the horrors that society inflicts upon men of low status, the tricks and lies that throw them by the millions into wars that benefit the rich, and general career sand traps they&#x27;d fall into (just on account of being young and not fully formed yet) if they had to fend for themselves... and, also, to protect young women from men below their socioeconomic milieu. (The current clusterfuck surrounding college rape-- it turns out that ivory-tower institutions are completely out of their depth when dealing with a felony that is one of the worst things that one can do to another person-- illustrates, of course, that men of high socioeconomic status can be dangerous, too.) Socioeconomic class is about how long you can delay adulthood and the lack of a safety net and the period of life in which you&#x27;re held accountable for your choices.<p>Widespread college also serves society by taking a large number of promising but at-the-time economically useless people off the job market. It protects the students, and it protects the market from their wage depression, and it protects society from a deluge of unemployed people who are (based on socioeconomic status and academic performance) presumed to be dangerous and intelligent enough to be threatening (in a revolutionary sense, i.e. &quot;don&#x27;t overthrow the government; party on your parent&#x27;s dime for 4 years&quot;).<p>You&#x27;re not going to see 30-year-olds in college because, in truth, they&#x27;re too economically useful (whether they&#x27;re paid well is another matter) and because they&#x27;re not deemed to need protection at that age (rather, the young are judged to need protection from them). Also, it doesn&#x27;t really <i>work</i>. College sells itself as the &quot;get to age 22 without having to explain yourself&quot; option, which is great because most of us <i>would</i> have to explain ourselves if we called our own shots from 18-22... but if you&#x27;re 30 and just completed your BA, you&#x27;ll still be asked to explain yourself, defeating much of the purpose.<p><i>Unrelenting demand for better-educated workers</i><p>Man, I wish.

I&#x27;m not saying that we <i>should</i> have such a perk and we&#x27;re certainly not owed or entitled to it, but it&#x27;s what we&#x27;d have if demand were actually so high.<p>At the upper levels of education, demand is actually pretty low, as illustrated by the academic job market. In fact, the rarity of high-quality work experience is often used as leverage against top talent: they&#x27;re typically specialized to such a point that few companies are doing what they&#x27;re good at, and they have to take a cut (in pay or conditions) relative to what they&#x27;re actually worth in order to protect the specialty.",1418421025

If you are going too call that a tax on you, then you need to call your income $115,300 for the purposes of the % calculation.<p>- You can&#x27;t subtract the opportunity cost of not working from your income when you make $115k, because you&#x27;ve made the decision to work and earn that salary.\n- The EITC is for people who <i>work</i> (hence the &quot;earned&quot; part).  If you chose to go exclusively on govt assistance, your max EITC is $11 for a family of 4: <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/Earned-Income-Tax-Credit-Do-I-Qualify"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/Earned-Income-Tax-Credit-Do-...</a><p>- I don&#x27;t doubt that there is a measurable amount of disability insurance abuse, but the fact remains that you probably have a disability that prevents you from doing child care.  The poor still often have to pay for childcare.  In any case, the average annual benefit for a family of 4 comes to about $24k, not $30k: <a href=""http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/quickfacts/stat_snapshot/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/quickfacts/stat_snapshot/</a><p>Subtracting the opportunity cost of not working from vs working at 115300k muddies the comparison.  It&#x27;s more sensible to compare the two scenarios separately:<p>115300-15300(payroll tax)-6500(fed tax)-4000(CA tax)-8000(foodstamp equivalent food cost)-2600(typical employee cost for PPO-health program)= 78900<p>vs.<p>12000(ACA)+8000(food stamps)+11(per EITC comment above)+24000(per disability citation above) = 44011<p>Even this comparison isn&#x27;t apples to apples.  In the $100k figure, are you accounting for the employer paid portion of health-insurance (and the lower rates that those in a employer-negotiated plan pay?), any tax-free employer retirement plan contributions, and other pre-tax benefits (DCAP, flex-spending account, employee health insurance contributions?).  If you own a home, are you accounting for the mortgage interest and property tax deduction?<p>I do agree with one sliver of your argument: making financial progress on $100k income is challenging for a family of 4 in VERY high cost-of-living places such as the Bay Area, where that remaining 79k easily gets eaten up by childcare, housing, food, transportation, etc.<p>Is the standard of living on the $115k salary equivalent to that of a family of 4 on govt assistance?  I don&#x27;t know, but I doubt it, and I would bet on the latter&#x27;s standard of living being significantly worse.  Neither situation is easy street.<p>EDIT: wording.\nEDIT2: formatting",1418420995

In Australia, for example, the major universities are within the major cities, often downtown; there are hardly any &quot;university towns.&quot; As such, there&#x27;s no real need to move out of parents&#x27; home if they live in the city, parents generally are more adaptive and respect the autonomy of their now adult children even if they&#x27;re still living upstairs. Obviously this dramatically lowers the costs of university. In addition, there&#x27;s a higher concentration of jobs available to work while you study in major cities, instead of just hanging out in dorms or frat houses playing video games with all your free time like many American students do. Juggling these responsibilities while studying and being close to your family will make one &quot;grow up&quot; and develop a solid work ethic much quicker than the extended summer camp that often American universities become.<p>Sports are handled by amateur leagues abundant in the cities, not affiliated and part of universities.

It&#x27;s getting someone to make the specific types of information you want that costs money.<p>Of course there are ways of restricting copyright infringement: laws respect for the legal system. A monopoly on the distribution is a powerful thing - it gives you a fairly easy civil case against anybody who violates that monopoly.<p>What it doesn&#x27;t do is grant you free enforcement of that monopoly, nor does it guarantee that someone will actually buy your product. Just because you want to make some type of art doesn&#x27;t mean others actually want it or that it is worth any amount of funding >0.<p>Also, you seem to be under the impression that money (profit motive) is the only way stuff gets created, which is patently incorrect.<p>&quot;disempowering&quot;?<p>Did you watch those talks? (mainly #2) This is about <i>human rights</i> that the arts should not trump just because they want to assert some new type of &quot;property right&quot; simply because they have devised some sort of technical trick to that tries to enforce some aspect of their monopoly.<p>To continue the example used by Doctorow, just because you have a copyright or patent on the software that runs a cochlear implant, you shouldn&#x27;t be automatically able to extend those monopolies to override the wishes of the person who actually has the cochlear implant surgically inserted into their skull.<p>Restrictions - limiting someone&#x27;s uses - are trivial to talk about when the copyright is on some movie that isn&#x27;t really important, so some people have accepted the DRM argument for movies. The point of Doctorow&#x27;s talk is that the concept of restrictions becomes VERY different when you&#x27;re talking about repossessing someone&#x27;s <i>legs</i> or <i>hearing</i>.<p>A lot of this issue comes down to the propaganda that has been used by the media industry over the last few decades. They created the incorrect term &quot;Intellectual Property&quot;, when <i>property rights</i> are not what the government grants you when you get a copyright or patent. You get some legal rights, which is fine. You get an easy <i>civil</i> court case. The current effort is to try and extend that limited, specific purpose monopoly into other areas by claiming that your movie, book, song, or software is &quot;property&quot;. Being &quot;property&quot; is important, because it is a lot easier to make a case that your property should be defended by force. We defend traditional property because it is <i>finite</i> (aka a &quot;scarce resource&quot;). Government granted fictions don&#x27;t need such protection, as they already have it by definition!<p>Now, you&#x27;re worried about how interesting art and such will be created, and the answer to that is simple: the same ways it has always been created, and if you&#x27;re clever, some new ways. It is easy to use Kickstarter as an example of new ways to fund things, but the cool, really interesting ways haven&#x27;t even been invented yet. I realize that this is probably a hard and risky business, but a copyright doesn&#x27;t mean you should be able to remove that risk by break the general purpose computer. A copyright doesn&#x27;t mean you should be able to get rights beyond the <i>first sale</i> and the ability to sue people that distribute your monopoly protected works, just because you found some technical trick (DRM) to make that distribution initially difficult. Being able to sue someone doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re entitled to have the government any enforcement costs. Most importantly, that same copyright doesn&#x27;t grant you a market or audience or any kind of guaranteed income, nor should it trump any *human rights&quot;.<p>It will be hard for a while, as new styles of funding are explored. Many musicians have already moved back  to a live-performance model, with patronage being used in some areas. I suggest that anybody thinking that restrictions (DRM) are necessary instead focus their time and money on changing to a new funding model - or inventing one - instead of wasting that their time and money trying to prop up pre-general-purpose-computer business models.",1418419842

I write software for Medical Devices and culture and process is what it boils down to. Tooling helps. We use C, C++, C# among other languages. Language makes a little difference in reliability, but not much.<p>What matters in a nutshell:\nKnow what you&#x27;re building: need good Requirements<p>Analyze those Requirements for correctness, clarity and uniqueness (no conflicts)<p>Make sure your design meets all the Requirements and doesn&#x27;t add anything: if you add a feature not in a Requirement, how will the testers know it&#x27;s there? Verify the design: i.e., does it do what you need and does it do it &quot;well.&quot; Does it barely function, or will it handle what you expect to be thrown at it or fail gracefully? Separate the concerns: e.g., need to be sure that the temperature is correct? The temperature control code and the temperature verification code should be decoupled from each other.<p>Code: probably where language makes the most difference, although different languages will influence your design.<p>Verify all design artifacts: review your Requirements, Designs, and all Code against predetermined quality standards. Reject anything that doesn&#x27;t meet the standard. Build what you planned to build, and document what you built. Most errors will stem from Requirements problems.<p>That&#x27;s Software Quality in a tiny nutshell ;-)",1418418850

Ice turns to life. Plants blossom. Animals breathe. The planet comes alive. Intuitively, do you expect/want the earth to stop thawing just prior to completion? Why should 90% of the earth thaw, while the rest remains stuck in an ice age?<p>- new shipping routes through the arctic, and more habitats for an ever growing human population to colonize. Who ever said &quot;more space&quot; was a bad thing? It seems like melting ice caps have a lot of economic benefits.<p>-BUT rising sea levels could wipe out coastal cities everywhere. Still, this would be a gradual process, and one which we can plan for.<p>Should we accept global warming as inevitable, regardless of whether or not human intervention accelerates it?

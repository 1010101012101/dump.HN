2141314,comment,2141144,2141144,0,0,jasonb05,,,"I just pressed ""publish"" on this book only hours ago. I'm happy to answer any questions.<p>From the back cover:<p>Implementing an Artificial Intelligence algorithm is difficult. Algorithm descriptions may be incomplete, inconsistent, and distributed across a number of papers, chapters and even websites. This can result in varied interpretations of algorithms, undue attrition of algorithms, and ultimately bad science.<p>This book is an effort to address these issues by providing a handbook of algorithmic recipes drawn from the fields of Metaheuristics, Biologically Inspired Computation and Computational Intelligence, described in a complete, consistent, and centralized manner. These standardized descriptions were carefully designed to be accessible, usable, and understandable. Most of the algorithms described were originally inspired by biological and natural systems, such as the adaptive capabilities of genetic evolution and the acquired immune system, and the foraging behaviors of birds, bees, ants and bacteria. An encyclopedic algorithm reference, this book is intended for research scientists, engineers, students, and interested amateurs.<p>Each algorithm description provides a working code example in the Ruby Programming Language. Source code and additional resources can be downloaded from the books companion website online at <a href=""http://www.CleverAlgorithms.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.CleverAlgorithms.com</a><p>EDIT:<p>Forgot to mention the book is in paperback, free PDF, and free online as a webpage.

2141271,comment,2140822,2140822,0,0,gaganbiyani,,,"I applied to Google and got rejected.<p>Its a pretty interesting story so I thought I'd share:<p>I applied through the traditional on-campus recruiting at UC Berkeley. Got past the first round of interviews on Berkeley's campus and then was taken to the Mountain View campus for 4 interviews and a bunch of events. That night, I got a call saying that the interviewers really liked me and recommended that I be hired. At most companies, that would mean that I was made an offer. Instead, they have these ""hiring panels"" where executives from various departments take a look at your resume, the notes from interviewers, and your transcript / other related documents. 3 weeks later I got an e-mail saying I was rejected during one of these panels. These people never met me; in fact, the 6 people who had met me all recommended that Google hire me. It was kind of weird, since no other company I had applied for had a process where people who hadn't interviewed you made the final decision on whether you should be hired.<p>Obviously, I am a little frustrated by it - so take this with a grain of salt. However, I think that my experience was emblematic of a few specific issues with the hiring processes there (though they have some amazing processes as well):<p>1) People who've never met you should not be pontificating in large panels about whether you would be a good fit. That just doesn't make sense.<p>2) Google has a very strong academic focus on hiring. It is clear when you interview with them that they care a lot about top-brand schools and top GPA's. They seem to believe that the best students will make the best employees. I am not sure, but I think the reason I got rejected may have to do with two C's on my college transcript (which is not indicative of my inability to Ace calculus but rather my lack of interest in attending class). Personally, I think the academic focus is much to their detriment - and a major part of the reason they've struggled at social. That said, Google has some brilliant people who I'm sure I would've loved to work with :). Take this answer for what it is but hopefully you'll find it valuable.",1295995578

2141230,comment,2139028,2139028,0,0,metageek,,,"At one company, I went through two rewrites, one bad, one good.  Sort of.<p>In January 1999, I was hired by appoint.net (which became eCal) to be their Chief Scientist; my main job was to rewrite their Web calendar in C++.  (The original version was in ASP.) It was a disaster.  I started by building the infrastructure API, but I made it <i>much</i> too complicated.  The team working on the rewrite got up to about 5 people before they admitted that they just couldn't understand most of what I had done.  We canned it sometime around November, having spent something like 3 hacker-years on it.<p>The team then went off and implemented a bunch of API features that talked to the existing application's database, but were written in Perl.  They discovered they <i>loved</i> Perl, and were highly productive in it.<p>About June 2000, the company decided to pivot.  The company's business was an OEM calendar; the whole app ran on our servers, but anybody could pay us to get a custom skin, accessed through their own domain.  It was popular with dot-coms who wanted sticky features to keep people coming back.  One thing that we billed as an advantage was that all the customer calendars were actually running against the same database, meaning that someone who had a calendar with Foo could send invitations to someone who had a calendar with Bar.  (What we didn't emphasize was that users could switch back and forth between Foo and Bar at will.  That was less sticky.)<p>But, in mid-2000, we started losing customers--not to competition, but to bankruptcy.  Management decided we needed to switch to the enterprise market--and, in the enterprise market, Foo did <i>not</i> want Bar users being able to see their calendars.  We needed a packaged solution; but our ASP implementation couldn't do it.<p>So, we started on a rewrite.  All Web stuff would be done in Perl; all database transactions would be stored procedures.  I was asked to build an infrastructure for the team to use.  I made a template engine--fairly standard stuff these days, but nice; the team loved using it.  I eventually got it pretty fast, too, by compiling the templates down to Perl on demand.  (We had a budget of 140ms on the Web server and 140ms on the database, which was computed to support 1,000,000 users on 4 Sun ES-450s--about $16K, I think.  We hit both budgets easily.)<p>It rocked.  Technically, it was a complete success.  Business-wise, well, no--we released in June 2001, a time when enterprises were just not willing to spend money.  Our pitch was that it would save them money compared to Exchange or Notes, and we were probably right; but they already <i>had</i> Exchange or Notes.",1295994751

2141221,comment,2139028,2139532,0,0,cdavid,,,"Exactly, that's the core of the issue: it is very easy to overestimate the advantages of the new design/rewrite. But even worse very easy to underestimate the advantages of the old design. Because in a bad system (the ones you want to rewrite), things are generally not that well specified.<p>That's also defines what may work as a rewrite and may not work: if your application has a lot of external dependencies, and is used by customers in a very tightly way, rewriting it will take forever unless you don't care about losing your existing customers (because you lose what works and what does not). What makes matter worse is that you are more likely to make those mistakes early in the business.<p>If your application does not have tight integration with the customer, then it becomes much easier to replace it, one part at a time. Otherwise, you are likely to just recreate the same monstruosity anyway once you managed to support half of the features from the old version.<p>I think rewrite make sense in some cases, but the natural reaction should be don't, especially when you don't have that much experience. Successful rewrites are the exception, not the rules. To make a dubious analogy, that's like the junior programmer would think that his bugs are actually in the libraries/compiler he is using. The senior programmer knows it is almost always his own fault, and the very senior one has a few stories about long night debugging caused by compiler bugs in the old times.",1295994618

I think of it similarly to a deck I'd present to an investor: I'd give my problem-solution spiel and then move quickly into my bio slide.  It is my personal opinion (and Mark Suster's) that the features, demo etc aren't absorbed/swallowed if that kind of detail is presented before the listener knows who's behind the product.  As a consumer, I'm inherently skeptical, so I can't stomach a whole page of ""the hard sell,"" even if it's above the fold.  Do you think there's merit in placing a tiny bio block or a whole paragraph--something beyond four words at least--from a reputable press review after the pitch and call-to-action?  I know it's not de rigeur but something worth thinking about nonetheless.",1295992875

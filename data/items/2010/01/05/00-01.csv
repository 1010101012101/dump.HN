If your game can only work at one skill level, you have to make that skill level really easy if you want to keep as many people as you can playing it after their first try.<p>The downside is that there is no reward for improving at the game. You play it a few times, and you do not improve. There's no newer corners of the game to explore, no new approaches to playing it.<p>Some games are so good that you can re-release them over and over for years with just a few changes and maybe some new content, and people will keep buying and playing it. Tetris. Puyo-puyo. Super Mario. <i>Those</i> are the games you should try to idolize, not games like Gears of War or Halo or random-indie-game-that-wishes-it-were-Braid #455321.<p>You can brute-force a game that sells a lot by playtesting it with countless focus groups, paying Hollywood-level for game assets, and marketing it to death on Gamespot and whatever, but that's the equivalent of hiring a giant workforce and grinding out your web app in some old Java enterprise WebPortletComponentModelerFactory thing.<p>Be agile, try small fun stuff and wander around until you get something that's fun to play, and then think up a way to make a full game out of it. Don't start the other way around, with the desire for 'some game' but no way to fill it out with the fun part.<p>Addendum: Don't be afraid to let the player <i>die</i>. That's why there are multiple lives (if your game works like that, I mean.) Most games I see today go as far as possible to prevent a player from dying during normal gameplay, to the point where you can clear many games on your first try without any sort of negative feedback -- Assassin's Creed 2, for example.<p>To learn to play Super Mario Bros., you had to die or watch someone else die. If you're setting out from the beginning in your design with ""I never want the player to die"", then just don't have lives and death at all, like Braid. It's ridiculous when you have a lives system in a game but contort your game mechanics to never use it. You end up creating an environment where a player never really gets negative feedback on when to not do something, and you have to constantly push them in the right direction with obvious and uncouth hints in order to prevent them from making an 'accident'. You're preventing your player from learning. Stop it!",1262652762

It would probably weaken the dollar against other currencies — but that would be good, not bad, for U.S. competitiveness and employment. So if the Chinese do dump dollars, we should send them a thank-you note.</i><p>I'm not so sure about this.  It might be true, but I think there is a lot more back story.  A weakening dollar is bad for people who don't have debt, and it's bad for people who want to buy any good produced in foreign countries who's currencies aren't depreciating as quickly as the dollar.  However, for anyone awash in mortgage and credit card debt, the weakening dollar is welcoming news, as it lowers the cost of the debt.  The caveat is that you have to be able to support yourself, despite the weakening dollar, while still not falling further into debt.  If you're able to increase your pay to match real inflation then you're in a real good position, but most people's income will lag far behind the increasing cost of goods.",1262652036

At first I though this was a quote by the license plate guy about how he sold his website, then I realized it was Grasshopper's slogan. Anyway, I have noticed that successful business folks seem to take themselves very seriously, often to the point of being annoying, but it seems to be a recipe for success, since potential customers are so bombarded with noise that they are looking for any reason to write you off.",1262649909

But now I have something I can put in my bag, ready for the next opportunity.)<p>EDIT:  Also, the term ""use"" might be considered vague or otherwise non-specific.  But it is brief and fits the intended tone of KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid).  In my mind, ""use"" doesn't create the mental 'stutter' that ""consume"" or another verb might.  And perhaps its repetition in the second sentence provides a subliminal reinforcement.  (While the use of ""do"" avoids repetition within the same sentence to negative effect.  Call the literary criticism police; I'm out of control.)",1262649836

Slowing traffic will, for any constant amount of ""demand"", necessarily increase traffic density. Increased traffic density would seem likely to have a positive correlation with accident rates that would partially offset the decrease you're hoping to see.<p>During the transition period, I predict you'd see a marked increase in the accident rate due to the increased instances of overtaking and broader spread of speeds. (12 cars all travelling at 80 mph on an interstate is safer than 6 cars travelling at 60 mph and 6 cars travelling at 80 mph. When you figure that each car governed to 60 will have to drive 33% longer, you'd actually have 8 cars at 60 mph and 6 cars at 80 mph to get the same throughput to destination on the highway.)",1262649830

While they may not be as efficient as revolving doors, I wonder where they sit on the curve?  Somewhere in the middle?<p>There are other considerations - swinging doors are less complicated (possibly), take up less room and are easier to lock (again, possibly).  They are probably cheaper to construct and maintain as well.",1262649786

8565407,comment,8565322,8565322,0,0,patio11,,,"You&#x27;re looking for an Errors and Omissions insurance policy, likely from an insurer who has a special product line for tech businesses.  Word to the wise: many of these insurers, despite having that product line, are effing clueless about technical reality.  The best reason to have an agent representing you is that you won&#x27;t have to educate an underwriter on the difference between on-premises and off-premises SaaS.  (I have someone I can recommend -- email me if you want her contact information.  Her assistance was very sanity-saving during the process.)<p>Your E&O policy may be bundled with a General Liability policy.  GL protects you if someone slips and falls at your office, E&O if your software breaks and causes damage to customers&#x27; businesses.  The fact that GL involves vastly more work, exclusions, and cost should tell you something <i>very instructive</i> about the insurance industry&#x27;s estimation of the likelihood of having to actually pay out on your E&O insurance. [+]<p>You&#x27;re going to use the fact of this insurance policy to drum up additional business for yourself.  Given that, it makes sense to pick a nice round number.  I&#x27;d suggest $1 million, which you&#x27;ll find is the practical minimum anyhow.<p>Kalzumeus Software and Appointment Reminder share an E&O/GL policy, with an extra (priced) endorsement for data breaches and regulatory defense (i.e. HIPAA).  The policy was priced based on a combination of how we earned revenue (consulting vs product income vs training, etc), how large we were in employee count, what industries we worked in, and our gross revenues.<p>Our policy costs on the order of $2,000 a year.  Speaking with business buddies of mine, you&#x27;ll find that that is roughly ballpark for most firms with less than 10 or so employees engaged in, roughly, &quot;our line of work.&quot;<p>You&#x27;ll find that who actually insures you is treated as a boring implementation detail, particularly if you buy through an agent, since they&#x27;ll come up with a few quotes and you get to pick on a price vs. features comparison.  The name on our policy is Warren Buffet&#x27;s professional liability company, US Liability Insurance.<p>[+] So I checked my policy.  Although this was not how it was explained to me, the policy describes roughly 15% of premiums going to GL and 85% going to E&O.  Assuming that is accurate, that means they -- sensibly -- think I&#x27;m more likely to be sued for nuking a server than for dropping a Macbook on someone&#x27;s foot.",1415238814

8565371,comment,8561654,8565131,0,0,Chinjut,,,"Sure. As you note, an apple would leap into the trees if the ground under it conspired to push it upwards. That the ground rarely does so (but the reverse, an apple falling and dispersing energy into the ground, happens frequently) is certainly an observation which merits explanation, but the explanation doesn&#x27;t come from an asymmetry in the laws of gravity, as such. It&#x27;s often said the explanation is found in something like the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which in turn is explained by the fact that at some moment, there was a state of extremely low entropy (the Big Bang); the &quot;arrow of time&quot; is then a manifestation of being to one or the other side of this particular low entropy moment. And the work discussed in the link (which I have no direct knowledge of) purports to show why some such low entropy moment should be expected to exist at all given the action of gravity over history.<p>But my point was simply to note that you don&#x27;t have to pre-incorporate an arrow of time to make sense of the laws of gravity, in response to the poster who found this a sticking point and expressed confusion over it.",1415238118

For example, comments are deleted, but there is a minimized moderator comment reminding people to not flame, telling someone to chill out, etc. I realized I liked this the best. Similar to what dang brought to HN, just a minor comment here or there saying what he&#x27;s doing behind the scenes. On the other hand, I can&#x27;t stand how moderation has always been done on BoingBoing, where the moderator is extremely conspicuous, and actively participates in conversations. It is still done in good faith, but it is really uncomfortable and the moderator basically acts like a regular participant who benefits from lighter scrutiny because they hold a banhammer.",1415237780

8565270,comment,8564471,8564929,0,0,huherto,,,"I guess Randomized solutions seem very attractive for us. I have thought about it, but the problem I see is that once selected the citizens can be bribed and they may be uniformed about complex issues.<p>An alternative idea is to follow the jury duty model. At every district, you randomly select a small group of citizens(the electors). They are brought together and isolated. Every candidate presents their proposals, background, arguments, counter arguments, etc. The electors listen, and each of them casts a secret vote. You eliminate the candidate with the least number of votes and do another round. You do that until you have a winner. At that moment you have elected a member of congress and the electors are dismissed.<p>Edit:\nThe advantages:<p>- It is very inexpensive. Easy to set up.<p>- Campaigns are short and you don&#x27;t need donors.<p>- Lesser-known candidates would have better odds of winning.<p>- Campaigns will not be based on simple slogans that can be said in less than 30 seconds.<p>- Democratic.<p>- Transparent. The process can be televised. Like a trial.<p>- The electors can choose their preferred candidate without throwing their votes away.<p>- It would make third parties viable.<p>The drawback is that people may feel like they are not participating.",1415236196

You should be able to find a relatively cheap policy if you are single and elect a high deductible.  While the likelihood of a major medical illness is relatively low for healthy, young individuals, you never know when medical catastrophe can strike.  I know couple of young individuals who were tragically diagnosed with cancer and did not have health insurance.  You do not want to find yourself in such a position.  Thank goodness Congress enacted health reform earlier this year.  While the bill is not perfect, I personally am pleased that it includes a health insurance mandate.",1283450362

I've got a policy from my university, but it's still a significant document of legalese that doesn't easily explain what I am and am not entitled to.<p>It would have been nice if the health care reform created some sort of common labeling for policies that allows you to quickly scan your coverage. Or even some online ""what if"" simulator, where you can ask questions about what the policy will and will not cover (startup idea here?)",1283450361

Private universities and colleges can easily get to $30,000/year.<p>As for healthcare, it IS that bad. Most working people have reasonable coverage (some of then even at reasonable price, as a percentage of income). However, it ties the worker to the employer. If you get fired, you lose your health insurance. If you quit, to move to another job, you lose your health insurance and have to get a new one (and at least until the recent healthcare laws, they didn't have to accept you -- sucks if something happens during your first job, because it's a ""pre-existing condition"" for the new one).<p>The end result is that employees are often held captive by their job because of the (essentially unrelated) health benefits. A friend of mine married 6 months earlier than planned to get coverage because she lost her own job.<p>Job mobility is much harmed.<p>There's COBRA -- an insurer must let you keep paying for one more year. However, the employer subsidy is gone, so people who pay $200/month all of a sudden find themselves having to pay $1200/month after quitting their job (or being fired).",1283450228

The problem is that more and more parents don't seem to take the time to teach their children to respect others, be it authority figures, peers, or anyone else.  Children who are taught by their parents that it's fine to be disruptive (at inappropriate times, at least), ignore their responsibilities, and generally think it's ok to do whatever they want make it harder for the other children to learn.<p>The field of education has evolved over hundreds of years, and there are plenty of researchers working hard to find better ways to teach children.

That's a perfect recipe for social awkwardness.<p>Isolation is not a primary component of the homeschooling/unschooling approach.

One might be that Rusty Foster increasingly lost interest in too much active sysadminning, and eventually added a $5 registration fee, which he thought would raise the quality of the userbase, but actually ended up completely killing any new registration. Another might be the rise of blogs. Although I like the submit-to-K5 model, blogs <i>do</i> make it a lot easier to just post on your personal blog and link somewhere if you prefer. I think there are especially economic incentives to write good content on your own blog rather than on a community site these days (you can make a little money from even a personal blog, get pagerank/prestige from it if it's attached to other projects, etc.).<p>Of course, that's exactly the part I'm ambivalent about, even though I do it too.

1656926,comment,1656404,1656404,0,0,davidcuddeback,,,"When I have kids, I might consider this.  One of my big fears is that I may not be the most qualified person to teach my children.  The idea of un-schooling actually reminds me of a program that I went through in elementary school.<p>When I was in elementary school, I was identified as a ""gifted"" pupil.  Once a week, I was removed from regular class for a few hours and sent to the GATE program (Gifted And Talented Education).  It was run in a way that my natural curiosity led me to learn things that were considered above my level.  For example, one of the activities that GATE provided was being able to draw pictures by plotting coordinates.  You would be given a set of instructions that looked like:<p><pre><code>    (2,2)\n    (2,6)\n    (6,6)\n    (6,2)\n    (2,2)\n    STOP\n    (2,6)\n    (6,2)\n    STOP\n</code></pre>\nThat would draw a square with a diagonal line through it.  Of course, they had more interesting pictures than this example, such as a horse.  Naturally, I wanted to draw these pictures, so I learned how to plot coordinates.  Later, I discovered a more challenging set of pictures--the coordinates involved negative numbers, and the grid included all four quadrants of a Cartesian coordinate plane.  My teacher gently nudged that it's more advanced, but when I wanted to try anyway, she taught me about negative numbers and I was successful at plotting the negative coordinates.  This was all while my peers who were not attending the GATE program were still learning basic arithmetic.<p>Later, in 4th and 5th grade, I was put in a full-time GATE class.  This was a regular class in elementary school, which was comprised entirely of ""gifted"" pupils.  It wasn't free-form like the weekly GATE sessions, but it was structured in a way that helped gifted pupils more than a regular classroom.  I think the GATE program is partially responsible for me excelling in math.  When I arrived at junior high (6th grade), I was placed in the <i>advanced</i> 7th grade math--honors pre-algebra.<p>There's a little bit of information about the GATE program here: <a href=""http://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/gt/gt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/gt/gt/</a>, but that resource is mostly bureaucrat-speak.<p>Another resource that helped me excel in math was my 2nd grade teacher.  I was picking up math faster than the other students, so my mom suggested that I ask my teacher for something more challenging.  I did, and my teacher gave me a different assignment from the rest of the class.  (I don't remember today what those assignments were--probably double digits when the rest of the class was learning single digits.)  I remember during a car ride home asking my mom and older sister how to multiply double digit numbers.  They explained it to me and wrote down a few problems for me to work out.<p>The tl;dr version of my comment is: I completely agree with the premise that a child's natural curiosity is an excellent catalyst for learning.  If you're lucky, you might find a resource that nurtures your child's curiosity, even in the institutionalized school system.",1283449069

And they know that it's not in their interest to bankrupt the business. There are generally ways to reach an arrangement: try to push the paternity itself further, correctly plan the pat' leave, use part-time instead, etc...",1283447260

This is plainly not the case - the swedish government spends dramatically less than individuals/companies do in the US to provide the same level of care.  If, for example, the author subtracted healthcare benefits from US workers, and subtracted them from swedish workers as well, sweden would compare substantially better.

62561,comment,62519,62559,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I've always heard the brain was the most complex thing that we know about. And I've always heard that brain surgeons spend a considerable amount of time planning some operations due to the complexity involved (although I am sure not all operations). ",1191415226
62560,comment,62348,62528,0,0,jkush,,,"Finding angels isn't as hard as you think. Someone you know or someone your founders know has a connection that can be used. Find it and use it. Angels tend to know other angels, so all you need is to find one. Even if that investor doesn't want to invest, there's a good chance they'll be really excited for you (having been there themselves). <p>If they don't help you out financially, they might connect you with angels they know. <p>The short version: if you already have traction and are passionate, find an angel. \n",1191415213
62559,comment,62519,62557,0,0,davidw,,,"Actually, I would bet that brain surgery is difficult, rather than particularly complex.  Indeed, your scope for action is probably pretty limited compared with writing a huge program.<p>And... brain surgeons probably practice (start doing) on animals or something else before trying it on people.  At least I hope they do.",1191414896
62558,comment,62519,62519,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"It seems like the key point of his idea is that induction is the key to success.  Edison used a massive amount of induction (experimentation) and prototyping while exploring the big idea of a light bulb - and things worked out well for him :).   I think you can also argue that a plan based on prior induction makes for a much cleaner, faster, and better built prototype.",1191414545
62557,comment,62519,62519,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Wow. I like this article a lot. I think it captures the essence of what we're all talking about.<p>\nHaving said that, it's not a one-size-fits-all kind of deal. I certainly wouldn't want my brain surgeon saying ""Hey. Let's just cut this schmuck's head open and see what we get, okay? Where's that can opener?""<p>\nA startup looking for user desires and aligning them with economics is a simple system. Act more and plan less to do it right. Brain surgery, creating the space shuttle code, or integrating all of GE's client software is not a simple system. Here's the kicker: some of these are complex because of the underlying nature of the problem (brain surgery) and some are complex because of the underlying nature of the _people_ (GE). Still, the end is the same. No amount of fast prototyping and ""users love me"" is going to fly in a complex environment. Now you might invent it and sell it to GE, but that's a different story. Simple environments mean you have to plan to answer simple questions, like ""am I making something that users want?"". Complex environments mean you have to plan to answer all kinds of other questions, like ""How do I communicate what we're doing to 30 important stakeholders, some of whom may not like our project?"" BTW, I hate complex environments.<p>\nSo yes, by all means make something quickly and adapt. But know when that strategy works and when it doesn't.",1191414510
62556,comment,62030,62520,0,0,startupcrazy,,,"I was wondering when someone would finally make a comment about Lisp. In fact, this could very easily be a story about Lisp. Using Lisp to create grammars to read and execute specification files. This developer was forced by the client to write entirely in Java, but would probably have used Lex and Yacc, plus Java, if given a choice. I suspect, folks around here could get the exact same results in Lisp. The key is, Lisp programmers have likely been taught to think about the problem in a similar manner. The key is how you think about the problem, not the specific tools you use. ",1191413904

After all the suggestions fellow hackers have put in (including you), I am convinced to pick up ""Introduction to Algorithms"" and take it from there.  <p>Thank you (all of you).

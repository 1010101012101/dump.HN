Then, when people want to schedule a meeting (regular or recurring), and it isn&#x27;t incredibly urgent, they&#x27;ll generally default to Monday or Tuesday, days where I primarily handle meetings, email, and short activities.  This works well with automated tools that find the next available timeslot that everyone has marked as &quot;free&quot;.

But you know what drive proponents of free speech batty?  When people don&#x27;t understand the philosophical underpinnings of why we advocate for free speech.  And this happens all the time on HN.  Hopefully, this is because of all the non-U.S. visitors that come to this site.  For those, a little explanation.  We come from a culture of free speech.  We think it is good, and we are the descendants of people who thought it was good.  We were taught that it was good from when we were small children.  Our experiences are that busybodies and tyrants are the ones who push for censorship and work in the shadows.  And those are some of the reasons why freedom of speech is enshrined in our constitution.  We do not think: because it is in the constitution, therefore it is good.  So to us, it is not like deciding to drive on the left or the right side of the street.  Each being perfectly reasonable, and which ever way they do it where you live is an accident of fate.  And we do not think that free speech is only reserved for political topics, or when talking to governmental officials.<p>When someone starts to mention legal technicalities of free speech, it makes me want to barf on their shoes, because they are completely missing the point.  We grew up with it as a minimum expectation of decency.  A fundamental human right.  Slaves and servants don&#x27;t have the luxury of free speech.

However, a function can get to a statement that needs to wait for something <i>outside</i> of the interpreter -- usually I/O, but it could also be a timer.<p>What happens at that point isn&#x27;t thread-switching. The function gets suspended and control goes elsewhere in the program, just like if you yielded from a generator. (It&#x27;s the same mechanism.) The function can be woken up again by feeding it the data it was waiting for -- the asyncio main loop is responsible for this.<p>If you actually want your processor to do more things at the same time, though, asyncio&#x27;s model of asynchronous computing isn&#x27;t going to do it. Python programmers are afraid of threads (I mean, they have a lot of disadvantages and not much benefit in Python, due to the GIL), so they&#x27;ll tend to use multiple processes for that, instead of threads.<p>EDIT: But at this point I realize you&#x27;re asking about a much more specific thing in the article. This article is asking you to not be afraid of combining threads and asyncio. It&#x27;s suggesting that a useful asynchronous thing you can do is to spawn a thread, perform a computation in it, and wait for the result.<p>At this point you do need to worry about the GIL. C extensions can release the GIL, so the article suggests you use one of those (NumPy).",1449009495

It&#x27;s anothe form of reuse for the libraries that already do intellisense, compilation, or other syntax-specific functions.<p>In the 2nd and 3rd generation codenvy systems, we tried to duplicate some of the JDT capabilities for Java directly within the browser with webworkers. We had to write that in JavaScript.  I believe this is how C9 handles their support for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<p>We had pretty decent support, but there were all sorts of issues: having to rewrite JDT services is nearly impossible and really the domain of language teams, the browser has limited context where many intellisense services need access to multiple directories and meta information, and there were some performance issues in certain edge cases that are hard to resolve without having certain I/O and cache mechanisms (which are readily available on file systems).<p>So the VSCode model of reusing the language services and then layering on a stdin / stdout protocol is pretty smart.  We are doing a similar approach with Che, but instead of stdin / stdout, we are packing a restful interface on top of the JDT & JavaScript services.  We see some potential to consolidate vscode & other approaches into a multi-language intellisence server, powered by REST + stdin + stdout.  That would be really fun to have all programming languages remotely accessible through a common protocol.",1449008391

I know they were good because companies later succeeded with that business plan.

We must rely on the judgment (and personal values) of a few rich people and hope they pick charities that maximize the benefit.<p>Would the outcome be better or worse if we had, say, a 99% tax bracket at >$N million, and let the public decide the best way to deploy that funding via the ballot box? Would that process better align with the values of a democratic society? Or would we just get more corporate welfare, bombers and aircraft carriers?<p>I&#x27;m not ragging on philanthropy--it&#x27;s awesome that some of these billionaires understand the meaning of &quot;enough&quot; and choose to give away their fortunes to worthy causes. But is it best for society to leave it to a few lucky &#x27;elite&#x27; to judge what is and isn&#x27;t a worthy cause?",1449007302

If not, you&#x27;re essentially writing a new operating system but now in a browser, following the (too often seen) anti pattern of implementing the same functionality already available but then on a higher level, only resulting in performance loss.<p>JavaScript for web development should merely be a scripting language, augmenting the functionality of your web page. If, for performance reasons, you require multiple threads then switch to a native app.<p>Furthermore, if JS is only used to augment the functionality of a page, the costs of the theoretical concurrency issues are negligible and a mere check for whether the sound has been played, if not play the sound and set a flag, if not do nothing should suffice and be correct in the overwhelming majority of cases.",1437865166

The cheapest setup will still cost you a few hundred dollars per year, but from start to incorporation it will take you at least 2-3 weeks.<p>Many will need the services of a tax consultant to deal with the taxes, which also involves some costs.

Something similar to a LLC costs more to incorporate, but with the cheaper ones you are liable with your private property.

9949366,comment,9948255,9948255,0,0,curiousjorge,,,"I read these type of people walk the fine line that separates criminals, the propensity for violence and murder while wearing a uniform doesn&#x27;t fix psycopathy. Not to say all police officers are built this way, and certainly there are elements that I can observe as an outsider that makes American style policing to be particularly and overwhelmingly lethal and excessive. I have a hard time buying the liuetenants response that this is the norm. What kind of fucked up policy allows guns drawn officers with questionable safety margin to kick out a suspected squatter? It raises even more questions like, what if the author was African American? Or maybe he had tattoo on his face? If people wearing a uniform are free to choose a response in their own thinking, how much of past fatalities by police force were caused by trigger happy and blood thirsty individuals that are clearly psychopaths? How can the public trust enforcers who more than coincidentally use excessive force before the usual buckshot is laid out? It must be truly terrifying to be American, and stories like this makes me inclined to keep my Canadian citizenship. Not taking the higher ground, we&#x27;ve had exactly such police brutality, but almost in most cases they&#x27;ve resulted in criminal conviction. On the other hand a super lax and incompetent police force like those in Korea or Japan is equally frightening, but much less than a trigger happy, God knows what type of disorder suffering badge wearing individual will react in high stress situations, especially one that is escalated entirely by themselves.",1437864946

If a civilian is injured during the chase, there&#x27;s lots of dramatic footage for the prosecution lawyer to show the jury, before asking the officers in charge to answer under oath why they made the decisions they made.<p>Sounds like pretty strong evidence in favor of mandatory police body-worn cameras, along with a right of citizens who are on the receiving end of a police encounter to obtain and review the footage. There&#x27;s always the worry that the camera would be &#x27;accidentally&#x27; turned off by the police, or that the footage would be lost if it showed anything embarrassing to the police, so to make them effective,  you probably need a change in the law such that any discrepancy between the officer&#x27;s version of events and the citizens is AUTOMATICALLY decided by judge/ jury in favor of the citizen if the &#x27;mandatory&#x27; video footage is for some reason unavailable.",1437864866

9949293,comment,9948575,9949222,0,0,saurik,,,"I enjoyed the first half. Near the end, when he started talking about LessWrong (he had done it earlier, but I didn&#x27;t know &quot;LW&quot; was an acronym) it became clear he was misrepresenting himself as blue and was in fact grey: a lot of people who are grey assume they are related to red, and so when you go to find grey you pick apart red, but that viewpoint also shares a lot with blue, which is why his earlier attempt to fix the political skew in the user surveys, a strategy that only seemed to try to recount reds, failed to discover what I would personally assume, which is that the website has very few actual blues.<p>He also started railing on specific behaviors in the second half, behaviors he was doing himself in the article, something he thankfully noticed and commented on, but then did not defend, other than to use the same excuses he said were flawed earlier: failing to realize the audience of people who read this website are also mostly grey; the only people reading his articles who are blue are people who got linked to the blog for the first time, or (as in my case), got tricked by a compelling hook. (I read this article due to the comment here by someone about &quot;that&#x27;s not how dark matter worked&quot;, and then stayed as I was excited to read an article that sounded sort of grey but was supposedly written by a blue.)<p>Maybe humorously, I believe the persistent issues he seems to have with people &quot;misinterpreting&quot; him are actually coming from this same source: people who are blue occasionally read his comments for various reasons, realize he&#x27;s grey, and then complain about various things he&#x27;s saying by using words like &quot;feminist&quot; as short-hand for blue. In practice, all of my friends who are grey run into the same issues with the things that they say, and honestly it has been harder and harder for me to keep arguing with them as opposed to just giving up and reinforcing my bubble (which I really don&#x27;t want to do: I even have tried to notice the dumb things I do that turn off reds and have attempted to fix those).<p>The only real &quot;point&quot; made in the later part of the article is to try to claim red and blue are equivalently dumb (a very grey thing to do ;P) by drawing an analogy from party dynamics to religious persecution. However, despite claiming earlier that he understood that absolute effect is not a good proxy for whether something is a problem or not (when he said he understood racism was worse than partyism), he somehow managed to entirely ignore that he found in his own terminology an objective moral advantage for blue vs. red: that blue only hated red, while red (by his own admittance one paragraph earlier) was causing collateral damage to people who weren&#x27;t even in the silly color battle.<p>So yeah: while I am concerned that this article&#x27;s terminology actually will reinforce a core problem rather than helping in any way (I didn&#x27;t have a good way to talk about grey before other than &quot;LessWrongers&quot;, which I realize is as useless as calling reds &quot;white men&quot;), I am having some fun using these words, and am finding it useful to try to divorce my mental categorizations of people from random incorrect labels, and thereby recommend others read at least the first half. Whether you read the second half or not is less interesting unless you need a concrete example of the problem and love the idea of seeing situations like this &quot;go meta&quot;. It is probably the case that jqm&#x27;s strategy was actually the correct one here, and I doubt shortening the post (I actually liked its verbosity) would fix the internal issues.",1437863551

I&#x27;ve been doing commercial software development for 28 years now, and my company&#x27;s products all reflect this. Whether I expect high-value security sites to use my software in production or not, well I certainly do not. Hardened stacks are few and far between, and OpenSSL can by no measure be deemed hardened (though certainly getting better of late thanks to all of the bug releases). Do I expect that my entire stack is 100% bug-free? No, but one of the niceties IMO of doing assembly language programming is that it is far less error tolerant in the ways you describe.

9949210,comment,9948255,9948255,0,0,joesmo,,,"&quot;I understood the risks of war when I enlisted as an infantryman. Police officers should understand the risks in their jobs when they enroll in the academy, as well. That means knowing that personal safety can’t always come first. That is why it’s service. That’s why it’s sacrifice.&quot;<p>I think that sums it up well. Many police officers do indeed act like they don&#x27;t understand the risks or even purpose of their own jobs. Policing has become an end in and of itself. It&#x27;s no longer about protecting and serving but about policing and arresting and jailing. It doesn&#x27;t matter if there is no crime, people will be arrested. It doesn&#x27;t matter if there is serious crime, low-level offenders will be the primary target. And of course, nothing is more important than officer safety. These officers are cowards who should be ashamed of themselves. They don&#x27;t have an altruistic bone in their body and probably wouldn&#x27;t lift a finger to save a baby out of a burning building. It is the citizens&#x27; lives that matter, that the police are sworn to protect. It is the citizens they serve. But that indeed has been lost.<p>Given all this, is it any wonder that much of the population no longer trusts police, many from negative personal experiences? The author is right. Until there is a huge shift in the way police treat citizens, this problem of trust will get worse. For many, it is a problem of hate, and in many cases, rightly so.<p>Yet the police and many other people insist that the change has to come from citizens. If only we give up our guns. If only we give up our freedoms. These things just make the problem worse by blaming the victims and forcing the citizens to give up even more for the well being of the police.<p>There is no movement from the pro police camp, and it&#x27;s been their turn for decades now. Until there is, hate and animosity from the community will continue to grow.",1437861842

Since Crossfit is gaining popularity, a lot of these types of lifts are introduced and learned within a Crossfit gym, so there&#x27;s little time to be acquainted with the proper way to do the lift.<p>Thus, when someone leaves/quits the gym, they&#x27;re not leaving with much of value: the strength they gain isn&#x27;t specific to any one sport (unless that sport is, &quot;CrossFit&quot; which is also a headscratcher), and the exercises they&#x27;ve learned could have been done for years improperly. That&#x27;s another recipe for injury.<p>That&#x27;s a lot of strange minuses for a gym that&#x27;s very expensive to belong to.<p>My comment was a joke, but the problem with injuries due to improper form while lifting is very real. It&#x27;s not specific to CrossFit, but as I&#x27;ve mentioned, the focus on # reps in a specific amount of time can exasperates that problem.<p>I myself have no investment in any commercial competitors of CrossFit. I&#x27;m a very fit person, but not in any way to CrossFit would measure. What I see personally in a CrossFit physique is a lot of muscle and weight that doesn&#x27;t do a lot of good in the areas of sport that I practice: running, cycling, and climbing - all of which benefit from a strength to weight ratio that would not be attainable utilizing a CrossFit regime.

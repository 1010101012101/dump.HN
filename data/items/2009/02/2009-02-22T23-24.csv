He who pays the piper calls the tune; there's nothing wrong with that.<p>You also need to understand that these policies are set based on factors beyond pure economics. The various financial sector bailouts are hugely unpopular among US citizens. If ordinary people don't see bankers sharing some of the pain then we could actually see riots in the streets at some point. Look at what has already happened in some parts of Europe.",1235347192

    3. It sounds even better when some initial work has been done on it
    4. An experienced business person agrees to champion it
    5. Your first customer writes you a cheque
    6. A founding team of five able individuals commit themselves to realizing the idea
    7. Your first customer is pleased by what the idea has delivered
    8. Ten more customers found
    9. Ten customers delighted by what the idea has delivered
   10. You pass the Five Tests:
           market belief, sales, flow, sound organization,
           solid finances, people, ready and eager.
   11. You achieve, fairly, the domestic market share aimed for in your market conquest plan.

They only make use of the imagery of reality, and don't support a range of actions remotely approaching reality, so many of the rules that make sense in reality make no sense in the world of the game. Adding arbitrary rules can just as easily strip away the enjoyment of the game as it can add to it--it depends heavily on the game and the other players.<p>This kind of lesson would work better if tailored more closely to the set of interactions available in the game world, so that the player can continue to play the game effectively, but must be conscious of additional restrictions--which is really what the Geneva Conventions are about.

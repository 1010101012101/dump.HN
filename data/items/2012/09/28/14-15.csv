In the future, I'm thinking of looking in other places (Twitter, Pinboard, etc.) for content to put in the newsletter, but the problem there is relating a link in a tweet to a particular programming language  things like PHP and Objective-C are easy enough, but just doing a search for tweets with ""#python"" and links in them isn't going to return very many meaningful results. So this is just a first release to test the waters and see if there's demand for something like Cccode. If there is, I plan on broadening the scope a bit. For now, though, think of it as ""the hottest (GitHub) projects in your favourite language"".<p>Thanks for checking it out!",1348844293

On the other hand, Google is certainly otherwise often in the business of providing free apps to people that they try to get as many people as possible to use on other people's devices (I mean, Android. On the other hand, even though Android is theoretically free, i think every device maker that uses it has a paid contract with google).

The former is a short-term employee, the other involves ""paying for a solution to a problem"".  Both are done for cost savings, but with a bit more up-front work to get in the door, the second tends to get you paid better.<p>I've actually taken this route as of a few months ago, and the best advice is to share your new plans with people you've worked with in the past who have appreciated your work.  Former managers, CIO/CTOs, even contingency recruiters who have placed you in the past (worst case, you work something out on a corp-to-corp basis and they'll have plenty of work and leads for you).<p>I mostly do data warehouse ETL recovery/refactoring, database performance tuning, and some data architect work.  The way I sell it is to distill my previous work down to some easily digestible details: ""Automated recovery of existing processes, eliminating manual hand-held recovery.  Improved performance of evening batch processes by 1500%.  Reduced replication time to DR site by 70%"".  Then, when asked about details, feel free to explain it in excruciating detail over lunch.  If they have a specific need, odds are you can get them the results their looking for -- explain your approach, common issues, and get in the door.  Even for something like, ""I need X built"", you have to look past ""I can do it"" and try to figure out what the customer is looking to get out of it (increased sales, conversion, etc.) and explain not only how can deliver on those metrics, but ideally back it up with previous history.<p>I've had lunches with former bosses, and talked to former co-workers.  I'm not the guy who networks at all (< 20 LinkedIn connections, ~20 friends on Facebook), but I was almost immediately inundated.  I have more work than I can take on at the moment, which means I'm simply raising my rate by 60% for the next client -- and they think that new rate is just ducky.<p>Patio also covered this topic rather well: <a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/09/17/ramit-sethi-and-patrick-mckenzie-on-getting-your-first-consulting-client/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/09/17/ramit-sethi-and-patrick-...</a>",1348842027

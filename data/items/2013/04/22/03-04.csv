It also depends on what you mean by academically inclined: are you interested in <i>doing</i> research, in <i>publishing</i> the results of your research, or both? In chemical engineering, for example (not my own area, but some of my family are in the field), it's much easier to find a research-oriented industry job than to find a research-oriented industry job that will let you publish openly.",1366603188

Go programming that targets 32-bit ARM CPUs and the performance would be shit if the Go runtime just assumed a 64-bit baseline.<p>That's why you have a -fint-is-32-bit flag or some way to bend the standard to make it run faster on those system when needed.  There's no way Go with it's shared memory between threads is going to survive any future shift to 128-bit computing anyway, so just making int always 64-bit is the best choice; if your maps or indexed structures are so vast then you'll need better abstractions than coroutines.<p>> [better C than K&R is] basically what Go was meant to be and I suspect the Go team would consider your description of Go to be more flattering than you perhaps meant it to be.<p>Well it certainly was not intended to be flattering, but I suspect you are correct.",1366602495

If you're suggesting that entrepreneurs can somehow influence venture capitalists to forget that they have fiduciary duties to their limited partners, and to act in a manner inconsistent with those duties, I think you're expecting too much.<p>Sometimes entrepreneurs make life more complicated than it really is. A venture capitalist exists to invest money on behalf of limited partners, and to deliver a satisfactory return to those limited partners. To support that end, he or she will provide some non-financial support to the entrepreneurs he or she funds. There are limits to this of course, and an entrepreneur should never assume that this support will be there indefinitely.<p>When a venture capitalist pulls back his or her support, a discussion about alignment of interests isn't going to be meaningful.

But that's only part of it. They also staked out the next generation advancement of the instruction set to a revolutionary and untested architecture (a VLIW variant) with certain compromises, all of which turned out to be a huge and costly mistake. It took almost a decade for the architecture to fully mature and even today it's still not very suitable for everyday computing. They hitched their system wagon to RAMBUS memory, which priced their systems out of the consumer-grade sweet-spot and their long-term contract with RAMBUS screwed them when DDR came around as an equally fast or faster alternative at a much lower cost. And they struggled with making decent chipsets for several years. One of the last pre-RAMBUS/pre-NetBurst chipset was the legendary 440BX which was hugely reliable, flexible, and high performance. After that intel chipsets had a long period of utter mediocrity.<p>In that window AMD made several strong moves. They produced high performance, low-cost chips using a very solid architecture. They developed an excellent next-generation 64-bit instruction set (x86-64) which had a great deal of heritage with the IA32 (x86) architecture and included mostly just very sensible changes and extensions. And they were able to create hardware which both ran existing 32-bit code extremely well and also ran new 64-bit code at competitive levels of performance. They also managed to put together a ""whole system"" in terms of cpu, chipset, and RAM which was at a very excellent intersection of affordability and performance.<p>Unfortunately for AMD, Intel very much learned from their mistakes, adopted DDR ram, vastly improved their chipsets, cut their losses on mistakes like IA64 and the early generation of EM64T systems, adopted the AMD64 / x86-64 architecture, and developed some excellent CPU technology in the form of the Core, Core 2, and Core i{3,5,7} architectures. Meanwhile, AMD ran into a few stumbling blocks and has had a tough time getting over them, let alone getting up to being able to compete head to head with intel again.",1366601246

I'd rather have some robust mailing-list communities, but they don't exist in all areas, and many people pay relatively scant attention to mailing lists. I do do most follow-up and collaboration over the internet, but in a number of cases with people I met at conferences.<p>In particular, I've found showing up at conferences to be a way to get your research onto people's radar who didn't previously know about it. Just by being there, and especially if you also give a talk, it can make people think of you as part of the X Research Field, and remember that you did some research on Y. In turn they're then more likely to engage with it, cite it, mention it to others when it's relevant, and maybe keep you in mind as someone to potentially collaborate with (if research interests align). All that <i>could</i> happen completely passively, by putting your paper on the internet and hoping people find it in a Google Scholar keyword search. But that's relatively low-probability. You could also try to approach people online, but ""cold-emailing"" people about research often ends up neglected, since people get a lot of email. Conferences by comparison give a setting where people are expecting to hear some talks and exchange short ""what I'm working on"" pitches over coffee or dinner.<p>I think it might even be true outside academia. Some startup/tech events are very focused on business/career networking, but others, like SuperHappyDevHouse, are great for intellectual networking.",1366600635

E.g. in graphics, SIGGRAPH is the top place to publish, and in HCI, the same goes for CHI. So attending conferences to present papers is part of the process of getting papers published.

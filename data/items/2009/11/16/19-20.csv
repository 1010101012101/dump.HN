So in a way we're culling some of our deeper culture and ability to ruminate deeply. Yet at the same modern society is creating a whole new information architecture. With all these efficiencies we've created, society has been able to create a vast amount of wealth that wasn't possible before. That wealth can be used to create that deeper culture or those more sophisticate inventions; however, when bits of information can only exist in small containers will we be able to continue the progression.

He did that when he said ""HTML.""<p>Regular expressions are a tool for extracting (semi)-structured patterns from unstructured text. For instance, it is unfortunately the case that we must treat English text as unstructured. It is not possible (at least not yet) to build a parser that will be able to correctly discern every syntactical structure in English text.<p>So if you want to operate on that text (suppose, slicing it into sentences) with a computer, then doing something incredibly superficial --- say, looking for periods --- is the best that can be done. It may need special casing for abbrevs., etc, but it would still produce <i>something,</i> even when the parser would get confused because it couldn't find the predicate of half the sentences.<p>Now, granted, HTML (or SGML) is not the same thing as XML. But the fact is that HTML is <i>by definition</i> structured. Even bad HTML is still structured.. and it's still machine-translatable because it has to be renderable by at least one browser (and therefore understandable by at least one quirks-mode SGML parser). Even the most technically incompetent designer in the world is aware that he has to load the page he's butchered into at least one browser and make sure it still renders.<p>Trying to use a strict XML parser on HTML will likely end in tears, because it has a different definition of validity than the quirks-mode SGML parser the designer used to check his work. But Beautiful Soup is not a strict XML parser, it's an SGML tool. One that, in my experience, is a pretty good approximation of the parsers the browsers use.",1258400819

None of those ""good looking"" applications really fit in with the host operating system's theme either; they sort of fall into the uncanny valley of GUIs where they don't look like they're using an intentionally stylized custom theme, but they don't look native either.<p>It's not just the theme that makes Tk seem like an antique; there are many commonly used widgets missing also. For example, I had difficulty making an editable listbox.

It flows well from a plot perspective (something happens, then something else happens, with good pacing).  And you asked for criticism, which is important.<p>Which brings me to the bad: the grammar is poor (see tsestrich's comment).  The setting is not realistic or believable.  One thousand years have passed since the present day, but the only obvious difference between then and now is that there are pretty capable robots.  Your character is still downloading web pages, putting them in a database, and processing them with Lisp.  In an era with AI computers so advanced battles have been fought and won over civil rights for them, how does that make sense?<p>You also tend to explain things a lot - there are a lot of sentences in parentheses with explanatory information.  Good sci-fi tends to leave a lot for the reader to figure out, because otherwise the world does not feel like a natural place that the characters are inhabiting.  In other words, it feels like you are writing the setting for a play, rather than immersing the reader in a novel.<p>Your metaphors also need work.  Your character has a nightmare where he is lost in a grid of big, black machines.  He ""ran and ran and ran like a race horse"" to try and escape the grid.  This does not strike me as an appropriate metaphor for this particular nightmare (not to mention that it is debatable whether horse-racing will be a popular sport in 3065).<p>I think you need to read a lot more fiction, and keep practising your writing.

Each complex being an autonomous psychic entity but a component of the psychic Self.<p>Each complex can have its own typing. The Anima (feminine complex) could very well be an ESTJ and the Animus (masculine complex) could be a INSJ. The compound result of all the complexes results in the dynamic and volatile nature of the psyche.<p>This multi-faceted nature of the psyche produces a (to me) accurate view of the psychic Self; a person can too have a type that generally dominates the whole of the their psychic Self as well (ie: I'm an INTJ, my Animus is more of an ISTP and my Anima is an ENFJ - don't forget there are other complexes).<p>Also, MB typing <i>is not</i> value free. If something were value free it would not be of value ;) The difference between ""introverted"" and ""boring"" isn't in the value of each term, it is in the interpretation of the value of each term.<p>One could consider boring and introversion to both be an inward psychic motion. Boring - to bore - going within; is uncomfortable for many people because <i>within</i> their psyche they must experience <i>their</i> complexes as opposed to <i>projecting</i> their complexes and experiencing them outside of the psyche (with other people, things, etc...). Hence why ""boring"" is imbued with bad or un-associative thought.<p>Introverts tend to be internally focused and rarely engage in the projection atmosphere commonly seen with large groups of familiars or extroverted (to different degrees) people. When a person is not engaging in a projection that another wishes to engage in, the person not engaging is typically considered ""boring"" or ""serious"" or ""anti-social"".<p>Please note, neither extroversion nor introversion is better or worse than the other. Claiming and accepting the complexes of the psyche within leads to both a happier introvert (that is more extroverted) and a happier extrovert (that is more introverted). Just like claiming and accepting the feminine or masculine self leads to a more balanced individual; it just happens that one is already dominated by the other and finds it to be a natural setting. The above paragraph was using familiar language to convey a point, but was limiting in its scope.<p>All things have value, even if that value is unit value (or 1). Value is provided by the human mind and subject to valuing meme levels (context dependent).<p>The majority of Hacker News readers are in a mix of systemic (computers, systems) and entrepreneurial (startups, ambition) valuing memes. The Hacker News reader typically values the experiences they have within their life at this stage based on those memes.",1258399619

I do think a k like language that used slightly more natural nemonics could have much broader appeal with minimal impact on code length. IMHO what makes k (and j for that matter) concise is the primitives, how they combine naturally, and how iteration is subsumed to avoid any form ""item at a time"" code. That last bit is what separates it from the common map/fold idioms in other languages.<p>Example: <a href=""http://www.nsl.com/papers/kisntlisp.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nsl.com/papers/kisntlisp.htm</a>",1258398408

There is much more to it than this of course, but I am asking the following question solely in relation to the storage of files.<p>I am planning on using a CDN (such as Amazon's S3) and my question is simple: How effective is obfuscating the names of publicly available files using a UUID for security purposes? For example, naming a file something like this <i>4b013ca21ba608373efb4717.jpg</i>.<p>I would be fascinated to hear any thoughts from the HN users. Certain questions spring to mind, like:<p>- How easy would these be to guess? Can there be any guarantees of uniqueness?<p>- What is the best algorithm to create them?<p>- Should I just make them all private and use authenticated access controls?<p>I understand that this is an application specific question, that depends on what level of security I require, among other factors. But, for purposes of this discussion, lets just say that it needs to be high, but no Fort Knox: if a file <i>was</i> comprised it would not be critical.<p>Thank you in advance for any help. :)",1258398359

The contractor would be toast (probably had an indemnification clause), MS wouldn't have been on the hook for that much even if the copyright holders of the GPL code sued for infringement, as it wasn't willful.<p>The GPL absolutely does not force them to do so. It cannot, as it is simply a copyright license. The GPL actually terminated as soon as MS distributed the code, since they weren't following it's rules.<p>I don't know if they have a formal agreement with the copyright owner, or if they're just following what is an accepted practice in opening the source, but technically GPL v2 cannot be ""reactivated"" on its own.",1258398171

I know they can snap up big names in a hurry, which Microsoft has also done in the past, but from the outside looking in, it seems like their hiring process is slow and consensus based, and from what I hear, you don't even know what group you'll be working in until late in the process.  For some people, that can look ""slow, secretive, and bureaucratic"".  I'm not saying it's the wrong approach for Google, but it is what it is.",1258398129

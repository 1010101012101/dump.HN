The lack of these factors would then lead to you &quot;probably&quot; having a 30 year longer lifespan (&quot;probably&quot; in the statistical sense).<p>You could argue that a more robust statistic like a median would provide a better representation of the expected lifespan less drastically affected by outliers, but calling the 30 year difference in average lifespan &quot;meaningless&quot; is disingenuous at best and could represent a fundamental denial of basic empirical evidence at worst (the latter of which seems more likely to me judging from some of your other replies so far on this subject).",1427680697

This is how almost anyone I know has ever gotten beyond that kind of salary. Also, GS15 is usually reserved for people that have been with federal service for 15+ years and isn&#x27;t exactly given out to newbies without considerable thought. However, that could certainly happen but there&#x27;s not exactly much room to promote them up honestly.<p>And frankly, $132k in the DC area is about as pitiful in the Bay Area if you ask me. Defense contractors alone command $140k salaries for senior developers frequently (the contractors that still do have contracts that is). If you&#x27;re in &quot;cybersecurity&quot; (whatever BS that actually means is beyond me when it comes to the technical definitions) you can get that with some pretty solid experience beforehand and reach into $200k as an engineer (not being management, which is usually where the caps on compensation tend to lift - see the ES pay scale compared to the GS).",1427680296

It basically defines any test-first coding practice to be TDD, including those that still spend considerable time and resources on up-front design.<p>What we really need is some properly structured study that compares professional practitioners (not just students or recent grads) over extended periods (not just a brief project that doesn&#x27;t show the long-term benefits or costs in terms of quality and maintainability) who are using no unit tests but otherwise common development practices (control group), the same but writing unit tests after the main code, the same but with unit tests written before the main code, and full test-<i>driven</i> development where other aspects of the development process, particularly design, are effectively replaced by the test-writing activities as advocated in well-known TDD books and other training materials.<p>Of course it&#x27;s all but impossible to really achieve that sort of like-for-like comparison with usefully controlled conditions, which is why these issues are so hard to debate objectively. But try finding any study with pro-TDD conclusions that doesn&#x27;t obviously fail the objectivity test in at least one of the three ways above (not a sample of professional programmers, too short term to draw general conclusions, or conflating TDD with some other unit-test-related development process).",1427679665

Probably every paternoster currently in use not only has safety sensors preventing (reasonably sized) objects being caught between cabin and platform but has had them since it was installed.

If that proves insufficient, you can raise this disincentive with fines and deposits, without imposing any hard limits on the tech.<p>Risk and dedication in the face of physical injury is a very substantial component of professional sports.  Essentially every boxer and many/most football & hockey players enjoy the benefits of repeated traumatic brain injury.  Olympians sacrifice large chunks of their lives to developing the physique and reflexes necessary to win - quitting doesn&#x27;t get the first quarter of their lifespan spent rigorously training back.

This might have made sense in an era where graduates were basically guaranteed jobs and a house cost 3x a graduate&#x27;s yearly salary (and mortgages were frowned upon).<p>In the era of massive student debt it makes no sense to cripple your children (and therefore your family) financially, if you can afford not to. Especially not to prove a point that can be learned any number of other ways.<p>In this era, I believe that &quot;don&#x27;t go into debt (unless you can afford to service it)&quot; is a much more useful lesson.<p>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, my children&#x27;s job is to learn, and to figure out how to excel. That requires time and breathing room. If they look like they&#x27;re turning into dilettantes, then of course I can decide not to pay for things. I just wouldn&#x27;t prematurely handicap them (and myself) financially if I didn&#x27;t have to.<p>EDIT> Basically, I object to your casting this in moralistic terms. Of course, we all know people who don&#x27;t  know the value of money. You&#x27;d be surprised at how often these are poor or uneducated people, though. If anything, having wealthy parents gives you more chances to learn how to deploy money intelligently.",1427677458

There would be two masters there, and that&#x27;s just fertile breeding ground for major frustration. (This is also not how inter-unit embeds work in the military, which is what colors my perspective.)<p>Regarding pay, I dunno. Based on quotes from this[1] article, the pay scale seems to cap out at GS15 Step 10 which is ~132k. Now obviously this is still a lot of money but if I&#x27;m reading between the lines of his quotes right, this is the most an engineer can make w/ USDS without bumping up to SES (Senior Executive Service) levels. Not to say that&#x27;s substantively less than industry salaries, but they definitely are paying government salaries (by definition).<p>As far as dissolution, I&#x27;m talking more from the perspective of attracting & retaining top talent. With a private sector startup, you trade job security for potentially out-sized payoff. But here... Anyway, point being I think the risks should be articulated well.<p>[1] <a href=""http://fcw.com/articles/2014/10/27/red-tape-holding-back-hiring.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fcw.com/articles/2014/10/27/red-tape-holding-back-hir...</a>",1427677282

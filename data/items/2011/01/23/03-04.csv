If what you want is a blog about your dog, you can have it for free with Wordpress software that you never have to manage the code for or pay for. I have a number of friends who use it and they couldn't be happier. In fact, there are plenty of other SaaS vendors out there who are equally happy to provide you with a place to write about your dog.<p>On the other hand, if you're running your own web application, you're responsible for it, just the same way you're responsible for your computer. As I said, I don't blame Microsoft if I download random software and that software does malicious things.

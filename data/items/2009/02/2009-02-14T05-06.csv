I sometimes run a win32 firefox inside a vmware window side-by-side to the native linux fox - even the vmware fox wins hands down, talk about humiliation.<p>The situation has improved a lot with Firefox 3 and the latest Minefields but it's still a night and day difference to windows or OSX. While the UI performance has become nearly bearable (at least it doesn't freeze rock solid for multiple seconds anymore) the javascript performance is still ridiculous. Usability tanks with only a few addons loaded and Firebug has become nearly useless to me recently because it has grown a habit to halt on any pages containing non-trivial javascript with the dreaded ""A script on this page made me pee, Abort or Freeze?""-dialog.<p>Opera is proof that it doesn't have to be that way. It's zippy on every platform, including linux. Just compare the two on anything involving alpha-transparency, e.g. <a href=""http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/</a>.<p>Well, perhaps this article will finally draw some attention to the problem. Linux shouldn't to be treated like a third-class citizen on the single most important app. After all many (if not most) developers, the people who actually build the visible portion of our internet, are doing it on linux.",1234590743

As you say: you didn't submit this and you're allowed to write anything you want. I still don't think it's HN-worthy, though, hence the flagging. It's not ""Let's piss masukomi off,"" it's ""hey, maybe other people were similar-minded and flagged this, in which case the story gets killed in exchange for a more relevant one.""<p>As for 3): I take everything personally kind of as matter of routine. I'm very, erm, passionate about stuff like this. Again, I hope you're not offended by my taking offense, because it's nothing personal towards you.",1234590712

There’s also the small point of cost.""<p>I would like to point out that this was written in 2002 when it was still valid. PDF is now an ISO approved standard (ISO 32000) and therefore quite open. Also, making PDF files at least for viewing is a breeze. If you use latex (and why wouldn't you?), pdflatex works great and can even handle edge cases like PDF forms using hyperref. If not, PDF printers are still a dime a dozen (quite a few are actually free) which can produce PDFs without any hassle.<p>In conclusion: PDF owns all.",1234590079

480866,story,,,4,9,futureintern,"Ask HN:  Would you rather work for Microsoft or Amazon?",,"I am trying to decide whether I'd rather spend my summer at Microsoft or Amazon as an intern.  Unfortunately there's only one of me...good problem to have, I guess, but still requires a decision.  There are things I really like about Microsoft and there are things I really like about Amazon.  Everyone I've talked to from both companies seems really happy there, but I guess if they're talking to potential hires that's then it's their job to seem happy.  The team I would be on at Microsoft is a reasonably interesting one (and my potential manager seems like a really good guy); with Amazon I'd get to list team preferences after accepting my offer.  The offers are pretty similar in most respects; one is a few hundred dollars more a month than the other, which is nice but I feel that it's less important in the big picture decision of choosing a company.<p>This decision carries extra weight because although it's just an internship, assuming I do well it may become my first full time job after I graduate next year.<p>So...if anyone at HN has experience working at either company, or knows people who do, or just has some advice/insight, please share. :) Thanks!<p>(I'm a reasonably active HN user, but created this account to increase anonymity - so I'm not just wisdom leeching.)",1234588737
480865,comment,479781,480177,0,0,masukomi,,,"a few things. First, you do make good points about the free books but as I've said before the vast majority of the free books out there, including public domain, simply do not interest me. Yes, Shakespeare would be nice, but I've already got the complete works sitting on my bookshelf. Project Gutenberg has made tons of books available for years now and so far I've availed myself of exactly one of them.<p>I have no interest in cracking someone else's drm to get a book on a Kindle, and the vast majority of the books i read simply can't be purchased in PDF format so even if PDFs do convert beautifully it is an irrelevant fact.<p>You say I ""obviously haven't used a kindle"" but I actually have. I haven't <i>owned</i> a kindle, but considering the title that should have been fairly obvious. I have put a lot of thought into what makes a kindle good. I've been jonesing for an e-book reader since I first read about the invention of e-ink years ago. I really want to like it. But, even ignoring the DRM, the kindle 1 had a number of physical & software flaws that would have prevented me from buying it. I'm not sure how well those have been addressed in the 2 but the DRM and economic issues precludes me from particularly caring.<p>But, you are very mistaken if you think I am ""a shill to those people who will mindlessly attack anything with DRM"". I have no problem with the iPod even though it supports DRM because I can buy the music I want and put it on one without  purchasing DRMd copies of it. I would not, however, buy anything from iTunes in their Pre DRM days, and to suggest that what attacks I do levy against DRM are mindless only implies your ignorance of the problems with DRM. Apple charged people a second time to un-DRM music they'd already bought. Microsoft sold millions of DRM'd songs in a format they then abandoned and will never be supported on a new device. However, there are uses of DRM that I don't mind in the least. For example netflix streaming movies are DRMd. I am not purchasing them. I am only being granted very temporary rights to watch them. Because I don't own it, I feel I have no right to expect to be able to back it up, or even to view it in the first place, so I will let them drm it all they want. If it goes away or is never playable again I've lost nothing.<p>If I could purchase the books I want to read and put them on the kindle without DRM (like i can songs on the iPod) I would have zero issues with it. BUT  the book marketplace is such that there is no reliable way for me to do so. I don't know how many of the .lit books you mention are actually non-drm but I suspect that a small percentage of the ones I would buy. What's worse is that there's frequently no mention of if one has DRM on it or not. Take [this book](<a href=""http://www.diesel-ebooks.com/cgi-bin/category.cgi?item=1429502355&source=&kw="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.diesel-ebooks.com/cgi-bin/category.cgi?item=14295...</a>) for example. Is it DRMd? Who can say? I can't, and thus I won't buy it.<p>As for it being a ""sensationalized article"". It was a post about why <i>I</i> personally won't buy a kindle, and why <i>I</i> think it's a bad idea on a personal blog. If I had of wanted to be sensationalist I could have done a much better job and would have insinuated that Amazon was evil and that we should boycott them and so on and so forth. Instead I gave reasons why I won't buy their product that they will hopefully take to heart when considering the Kindle 3. Also, I happily give them thousands of dollars a year without hesitation even though they make a product I don't happen to like that utilizes a technology I am opposed to.<p>As for flagging the article I think it's totally out of line for three reasons 
1) you started reading it knowing full well what the opinion contained within it would be because it was obvious from the title. If you were offended by that opinion you have no-one to blame but yourself. It's like suggesting you're offended by Muslims and proceeding to read the Koran. Remember the old joke? ""Doctor. It hurts when I do this."" to which the doctor replies ""Well don't do that."" It's actually good advice.<p>2) I'm not the one that posted the article here, so while you may have been offended by my words your actions in flagging the article will have no effect on your perceived offender. Also, I never suggested that my opinion on the kindle was relevant to this site, although the impact that DRM has on purchasing decisions like mine most certainly is, and this article provides a good example of that impact.<p>3) the fact that you found it ""personally offensive"" is again entirely your own fault. There was no personal attack against you or against <i>any</i> individual in that article. Nor, were there any implications that any person was bad for purchasing it. I even updated the article early in the day to reiterate a good point one of the commenters left about it being a good economic idea for computer books that would obsolete themselves long before the DRM became an issue. If you are offended by the fact that someone has negative opinions about a device you happen to like you are in for a lifetime of pain, because it's relatively safe to say there's at least one person in the world who will take issue with some aspect of essentially every object you own.",1234588728

Although I have to confess that my personal temperature meter is still calibrated in degrees Fahrenheit. (""Uh, it's 25 degrees in Rome today. Is that really hot? I can't remember."") For some reason temperature is my brain's last holdout: I'm pretty well used to meters and liters and even kilos. Perhaps that's because a liter is like a quart, a meter is like a yard (and a kilometer is close to a half mile) and a kilo is about two pounds, but Fahrenheit is <i>completely</i> nuts because there's an <i>offset</i> as well as a ratio in the conversion.",1234588592

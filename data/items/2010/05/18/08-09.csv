1356979,comment,1355220,1356238,0,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"I'm not bashing Squeak here. I know it's a nice development environment. Problem is, people usually judge applications by their UIs. Look at it this way: a desktop application is supposed to complement the features your OS already ships with. An application that doesn't feel like it's a part of the OS confuses people. Heck, I'd say any app that doesn't follow native UI conventions is <i>disrespecting</i> the user, especially if it's a paid app.<p>On non-Windows platforms, XUL apps suck. Period. As for webapps, I don't think anyone expects them to look native. The rules don't apply inside that browser window :p",1274173065

Rolling out updates to production without testing them first is a fail, not matter what OS you're using.<p>If they'd tested the McAfee definitions on even one of the POS terminals before rolling them out to all the restaurants everything would have been fine.  They could have even automated having one restaurant get the definitions one or two days before all the others so only a single location was affected.  Or better, set up staggered updates within each restaurant, so they all stay up and at worst lose a single POS terminal.",1274172951

I've worked on POS and smart-weighing systems that were cross-platform (Windows and Linux).<p>Neither used AV, but they were tightly locked down. My impression was that most customers don't care about the OS. Some prefer Windows, they already have the tech personnel in place. On the other hand, the Linux ports were done because a very big customer said that they had to have Linux... It certainly cost them more than licensing Windows. :)<p>From a dev point of view, Windows was easier, as it is generally more friendly towards C++ development. The OSes were about equally capable, I didn't see any Linux technical advantages in practice.",1274172914

1356968,comment,1356583,1356605,0,0,CarlSmotricz,,,"I second gtani's suggestion of clojure. It's a lisp that takes some of the pain out of lisp by using fewer parentheses where possible, and different kinds of parentheses (round, square and squiggly) so it's a little easier to eyeball where groupings start and end. Also, good support and interconversion of highly useful data types: vector, hashmap and set, among other things.<p>It's very FP but you can mutate state explicitly if you insist. It runs on the JVM so performance is very good (much faster than Ruby and Groovy) and Java interop is excellent, even better than with Scala. So you have access to the whole wealth of Java library code.<p>A big advantage is the very strong concurrency support. Laziness and FP give you some multi-core goodness with no effort, and the STM functionality gives you cleaner and more foolproof inter-activity synchronization.<p>In other words, recommended.",1274172515

All the deposits are FDIC insured, they clearly have their model laid out; interest margins (and interchange fees) have kept banks running for years, and those are banks with likely 50% more operational costs due to running actual branches.<p>It's obvious that opening this sort of bank and not selling high-interest rate loans and not charging fees for everything isn't as profitable as it could be if they did, but is it that far fetched that these guys will gladly make less money, but in exchange offer you service that you can actually enjoy?<p>Zappos could easily save millions every year by shipping UPS ground for everyone, charging for shipping and cutting back on it's customer service, but then it wouldn't be zappos.

But I do <i>services</i>, not <i>products</i>.<p>I have been a freelance software developer for 5 years now; whenever I get a spec for a project, I have this lingering fear in the back of my head that the client might turn out to be sour and not pay me. So I take a deep breath, evaluate the idea with the intention that I might be able to sell my code, iff they don't pay me. During those hours of fear I stalk the company and learn everything I can about them, trying to imagine an entire self-sustaining business.<p>If it's not something new and exciting, or something challenging, or something I could easily resell, I wont take it with a cash deposit.<p>Fortunately, things always go well and I take on the project, but as we get to know each other better and talk for weeks, my business side comes out and I become some sort of trusted advisor to them. I ponder the possibility of me consulting with them as a firm, and reach to my contacts for previous clients and other acquaintances for similar interest, and this is when I start researching as well.<p>I go back to the client with my brochure website, I write down everything I remember about their business needs, and we arrange casual lunches/meetings to see what they're up to and I inform them of my new venture. I try not to explain too much, and let them tell me exactly what services they might think they need from me (I work in marketing and advertising, so the needs are almost all the same; problems customizing COTS and SaaS packages); it's important to shutup and let your client tell you how they <i>think</i> you might be able to help them.<p>So, by now I have 1day/week gig that pays for the rent. I put together the token automated billing, receipt templates, email notifications, etc. I always have a PDF ""Guide Book"" document. Something that explains where they can find everything; support email, API keys, setup email accounts, etc.<p>Then I move on to the next project.<p>I almost always start something by talking out of my ass first. When I meet someone powerful and influential, I have this knack of opening my mouth and offering to help them.<p>In the consulting business, it's more important to be reachable, warm, communicative, etc. than to be technically competent. Most people hire me as a programmer but I always end up hiring programmers for them. If you can help someone sketch out the high-level designs and put together a prototype, they're more than happy to spend more money assemble a virtual team to iron out the kinks.<p>It's very important that you <i>get</i> business. The quickest way to establish your authority is to address the problems one might face in a certain industry/market-segment. When someone tells you they're a brand-manager, or M&A attorney, or VP of sales for telecom equipment, it helps to know a little about their industry and location to say something negative about its current climate. Amateurs are always enthusiastic about business, they think it's all flights, hotels and golf courses. So be weary of anything who tries to hype you into a project or industry. The real veterans are almost always weary.<p>[Edit:<p>Once a month I go through my contacts and shoot emails to people or catch them on Skype, just to touch base. I find it fascinating to listen to them talk about their work. And sometimes it reignites our partnership.]",1274170869

1356918,comment,1355051,1356111,0,0,sagarm,,,"Having a standardized back button means that when I hit ""back,"" I have* a hard time predicting what it's going to do.  Same for ""menu.""  Sometimes ""back"" goes back in history (e.g., browser), sometimes it goes back to the last activity  (if I got here via a notification).  Menu doesn't always work, and I have to tap it to see if what I want to do is in the list of options.<p>The iPhone's approach of putting these buttons on the screen has the major advantage that they are only visible when they actually have a purpose.  Usually, the buttons are also labelled more specifically than simply ""back"" or ""menu.""  For example, if you're looking at your folders in the Mail app, the back-equivalent button is labeled with ""Accounts,"" indicating that hitting it will take you back to the accounts list.  Also, the lack of a ""menu"" button discourages developers from just shoving everything into a menu.  The result is that more common operations end up directly accessible (and immediately visible), while less common operations (if any) are usually tucked under a menu-equivalent ""more"" button.<p>The potential inconsistency in semantically-similar button placement between applications is mitigated through HIG enforcement.  In practice, it's not an issue.<p>tl;dr: putting buttons on the screen instead of using physical buttons increases predictability.<p>*  That said, I've gotten pretty good at predicting what back will do after several weeks of using my device (with the notable exception of GMail, which breaks back button behavior spectacularly).  This was a huge pain point when I first got my device, though.",1274170692

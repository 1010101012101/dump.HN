However, teaching is a real world use, and that's why Scratch was developed. Programming concepts transcend languages.<p>Most people focus on Scratch's drag-and-drop interface, which does prevent syntax errors. Not fighting syntax errors means kids can spend more time learning programming concepts and experimenting with things that matter, such as arrays, variables, and stuff.<p>The under-talked about feature in Scratch that makes a good teaching tool is the ""single stepping"" mode. This mode steps through the scripts, one block at a time, allowing you to see the code ""execute"" as the game/story plays out. Great for debugging or learning.<p>Lot's of great places to find tutorials online. Try:

It doesn't have any way to quickly put the current search terms through image search. It feels very natural in google to click 'images' if I want to learn more about a topic, and I don't have that option in DDG.<p>3.

It says if a man is a good man and conducts himself exceptionally during courtship and marriage, his wife is almost certain to be quality.<p>And this is false! I mean, there's so many real world examples - some people are undisciplined, unambitious, self-centered, reckless, not grounded, etc, etc. Unfortunately, I know a couple guys, good guys overall, who married such women. No matter how much he toils in the marriage, it can't and won't be a good marriage.<p>The character and quality of your spouse has a lot to do with their character - you can help them grow to some extent, but you need to start from a good place. The idea that ""be a good person and conduct yourself well and things will work out"" sounds nice, but is in fact dangerous and bad advice. For both men and women, the base character of your spouse matters <i>a lot</i> - and that's before even starting to look at compatibility and having complimentary views. Idealism - ""be a good man and things will work out"" - sounds nice, but it's the sort of thing you need to be careful with.",1270238415

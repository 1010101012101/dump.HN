5959389,comment,5957500,5958693,3,0,negativity,,,"<p><pre><code>    #5 [...] Indignation is reserved for private citizens, so use it on their behalf but don&#x27;t expect them to rise up in defense of themselves.
</code></pre>
Can you elaborate on that? In particular, the &quot;use it on their behalf&quot; and &quot;to rise up in defense of themselves&quot; parts.<p>...and...<p><pre><code>    #7 [...] don&#x27;t assume that you know better [...] Most rules and regulations are written in blood [...] someone had to die or [...] some major loss of expensive or sensitive hardware [...]
</code></pre>
The excerpts I&#x27;ve pointed out in #7 represent a very serious philosophical grey area. Considering that some militaries around the world harness the power to use nuclear weapons to which can destroy entire cities full of people, there is a very broad scope of the definitions which can encompass the word &quot;hardware&quot; in this context.<p>Weighing the difference between the value of inanimate objects and the value of human lives isn&#x27;t easily quantifiable, but in the military sense the leap is literally made from an ambiguous grey to starkly contrasted blacks and whites. But we&#x27;re entering into times and places now, where we rely on these inanimate objects to animate themselves according to (sometimes imperfect) artifacts created by people well-removed from the circumstances of a conflict.<p>In my humble opinion, given the bizarre abstractions that many highly advanced technologies introduce into all spheres of human behavior and activity, and the rapid pace of continued advancement that has transformed how human beings inter-operate in coordinated behavior throughout the world, it feels incredibly dangerous to me, that not just military personnel, but the world at large is disinformed of precisely how decisions to kill and destroy are even made anymore.<p>Consider that civilian web traffic is being used to indict and adjudicate killing decisions around the world, which would be considered extra-judicial death sentences in the civilian sphere. Consider that the analysis of such web traffic relies on machine learning and algorithms. Consider that even the people that design the machines that govern civilian web traffic can&#x27;t even instruct each-other on how to exert explicit willful control over these devices, such that no one person can honestly claim that they have total control over a given device resting in the hands of a casual civilian. Consider that we have invasive software designed to sabotage industrial systems, that have accidentally leaked into civilian infrastructure. Consider that no less than a former general and director of the CIA (which advises the pentagon), had his career ended by a political scandal involving gmail.<p>There&#x27;s a very complex and disturbing equation emerging here, and as events continue to take shape, I think the more any one person refrains from questioning decisions made at any level in any hierarchy, the more we place all of our lives in jeopardy. This becomes especially true when we have to now question the very nature of some of our so-called &quot;inanimate&quot; objects.<p>Sorry to be long winded, but certain ideas can&#x27;t be summed up briefly and easily. Not trying to be an arm chair general, but everyone, including the all military personnel, needs to carefully understand what it means to trust modern electronic devices of any scale or scope, and especially who might be placing trust in electronics, and at what level.",1372442185

Personally, I&#x27;m looking for a solid language with broad library and interop, and fantastic tooling (from editors to debuggers, profilers, and more). .NET has a good ecosystem; MS loves developers (usually).<p>F# has nearly a superset of C#&#x27;s functionality, but with a far better fundamental design. It requires much less code, and results in far fewer bugs. And the biggest tradeoff is that Visual Studio&#x27;s IntelliSense is a bit less capable with F# than C#. Performance wise, F# usually matches C#, but has more flexibility to outperform it in some cases.<p>The F# team has a strong background: They were the ones responsible for bringing proper generics to C# and the CLR. Without them, the CLR would probably have a lame generics system, such as Java. F# also demonstrated how to properly do async on .NET half a decade ago, which C# 5 finally picked up.<p>So if you&#x27;re on .NET, there&#x27;s little reason to not use F#, unless you&#x27;re in a shop that needs replaceable warm-body programmers.<p>If you&#x27;re not on .NET, there are perhaps better languages (Haskell), but that comes at a cost of having less tooling and libraries.",1372441855

E.g. someone doing concentration meditation (as opposed to insight meditation) is going to have very different experiences.<p>I don&#x27;t think the fact that different spiritual techniques yield different experiences says much about their validity though. After all, you could easily consider normal everyday life to be a spiritual technique that yields a certain set of experiences.<p>&quot;To further the question, are you saying that the &#x27;counterintuitive claims&#x27; are something at which (again given enough practice/discipline) we all would arrive, or just that we would all share something similar to the experiences that they were born from?&quot;<p>I think that for every technique there is a set (in the mathematical sense) of experiences that can be experienced via that technique. And every time you practice the technique, you&#x27;re basically picking out an experience from that set at random (though certain experiences need certain requisite skill levels). So if you were skilled enough and had enough practice then your odds of having a given experience would increase, but they&#x27;d probably never be 100%.<p>You can see that though, for example, with the Johns Hopkins psilocybin trials, the odds of having some mystical experience over the course of two high-dose sessions are about 80%.

The parse tree for the closure should be able to ascertain the reachability of the variables in scope so that fences around particular sets of variables can be established. To do that would require something a bit more sophisticated than a single taint id though. You would really want a taint &#x27;flavor&#x27; such that for any closure and in variable in scope of that closure you could defined f(closure, var) which would return turn if that variable cannot be collected. I can&#x27;t think off the top of my head how you would recycle identifiers without risking temporal tainting (where a new closure in scope with the same id came at a later time and double tainted the variable leaving it essentially uncollectable or collected early.

This is really interesting, and potentially devastating for certain coding styles.<p>I ran the code on node and the RSS does appear to be increasing without bound. Even running node with --expose-gc and forcing a global.gc() inside logIt() causes the same unbounded memory growth.<p>Increasing the size of the array by a factor of 10 causes RSS usage to jump up by a factor of 10 every second, so we know that the memory usage isn&#x27;t caused by creating a new long-lived closure (i.e., the logIt() function) every second.<p>In fact, removing the call to doSomethingWithStr() doesn&#x27;t change the unbounded memory growth.<p>Here&#x27;s a shorter snippet that demonstrates the leak more dramatically (about 10 MB/sec RSS growth):<p><pre><code>  var run = function () {
    var str = new Array(10000000).join(&#x27;*&#x27;);

I am a regular user of RubyMine and while code inspection is it&#x27;s strong suit, the editor never felt responsive.  Hence the ST3 trial.<p>The method jumping functionality is very good.  Not on par with RubyMine; e.g  you can&#x27;t jump to an ActiveRecord method or any other 3rd party gem.  But for navigating your code base, it reliably finds method definitions across the whole project and find them quickly.<p>It&#x27;s not on par with RubyMine, but it&#x27;s still a solid addition.",1372439062

I can barely remember my SSN, and that&#x27;s about the length for complex patterns of numbers/symbols for most people.<p>Long strings for passwords should be the norm. I have no problems coming up with 30-50 char long passwords from scenes in my favorite book, Alice in Wonderland. They aren&#x27;t ever going to be cracked by a dictionary, they aren&#x27;t direct quotes, aren&#x27;t all the same case, and are unique. (It&#x27;s much easier to remember a long string based on each site than it is a random jumble of letters).

5959029,comment,5957850,5957850,17,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Sadly, this won&#x27;t make the web fun again.<p>So two things that are important to note here, the first is that the &#x27;fun&#x27; part of the web was learning new things and static HTML, even dressed up with HTML5 goodies, will be fun if you don&#x27;t know these technologies but no more or less fun than doing the same thing on a Raspberry Pi or something similar. Its the &#x27;learning&#x27; that is fun, and the web was more &#x27;fun&#x27; when you were learning it because it was all new, and once you learned enough about it to see it for what it was, the parts that are less seemly start to dominate your vision and it feels less fun. Which brings us to the second part.<p>The second part, and I don&#x27;t have a good solution for this, is that folks <i>will</i> use this, and they <i>will</i> put good content on them and they will get page views and searches and what not. Then the &#x27;link authority&#x27; of neocities will start to rise because, well it has a bunch of good content.<p>Once it crosses a threshold (which is sadly pretty low) then  a crap ton of SEO types will start creating pages on it to boost the organic rating of various web sites. And then Google will penalize neocities, and the good stuff will become unfindable (on Google at least) because Google won&#x27;t index it, or they will pump down host rank to the point where it shows up on the results on page 3.<p>Just prior to that people will build sites on it that do drive by malware injection using javascript. The preferred cloaking vector for that these days seems to be a script reference that points out to something that looks like jquery but really isn&#x27;t.<p>Then the owner is going to get a lot of threatening letters from lawyers who were told by people who got hijacked to &quot;get the bastards who did this!&quot; and the bad guys will be well cloaked but the neocities ownership will be just standing there, an easy target (for hassling at least, register your DMCA agent <i>right now</i> if you haven&#x27;t already to avoid the copyright trolls).<p>And at the end of the day the <i>real</i> reason the web isn&#x27;t fun anymore will become apparent. There is too much money to be made by manipulating it, and so its full of bad actors who are chortling away while stealing billions of dollars from hapless &#x27;lusers.&#x27;",1372438812

We had a different enclosure design for this iPhone until way too close to the introduction to ever change it. And I came in one Monday morning, I said, 'I just don't love this. I can't convince myself to fall in love with this. And this is the most important product we've ever done.'",1229229983
397225,comment,396186,396368,0,0,Zev,,,"My random thoughts on a way to keep track of this:<p>1. RSS feeds where the link goes to the hn thread instead of the linked page? Though not everyone uses an RSS program integrated with their browser and opening an external program to keep track of HN threads isn't exactly good UX.<p>2. Keep track of how many comments were made when someone first views the thread and if there's any new comments, change the link color back to black instead of the grey that would show that it was already viewed.<p>3. The star icon previously mentioned. Have items automatically decay from the list after a certain amount of time (or time without a comment) to keep it clean. Upvotes can/should double as favorites since hn keeps track what someone voted for already.",1229229977

397214,comment,395436,396303,0,0,boucher,,,"This has nothing to do with the framework. Javascript supports unicode characters, and so anything built on top of it for displaying strings will too.<p>The reason 280 Slides doesn't do this correctly is because it implements its own text editor by intercepting all keypresses. Unfortunately, there's not enough information in the JavaScript key event mechanism to properly handle internationalization this way. We'll eventually be removing this custom text editor in favor of a more standard approach.<p>Separately, while there's not currently anything built in for localization in Cappuccino, there will eventually be the same system that exists in Cocoa, which makes it trivial to do ""i18n"" with little or no actual coding.",1229228306

If you look at the GitHub Language Stats (<a href=""http://github.com/languages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/languages</a>) you'll see that Ruby takes up 38% of all lines of code on GitHub.  JavaScript takes up another 25%.<p>Python's only at 6% and Java, C++ and C files combined are only 8% of the total LOC.<p>Git actually is a nice tool and it's getting quite a bit better, but I prefer mercurial, and I think that it's an easier tool for devs used to SVN to make the switch.<p>A few weeks ago, I threw together a blog post detailing how I use mercurial (<a href=""http://naleid.com/blog/2008/11/25/my-mercurial-setup-plus-some-useful-shims-and-jigs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://naleid.com/blog/2008/11/25/my-mercurial-setup-plus-so...</a>).<p>There's buzz out there about mercurial, it's just hard to hear over the cacaphony being caused by git.",1229228279

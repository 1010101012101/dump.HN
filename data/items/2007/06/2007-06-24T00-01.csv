VCs get paid a cut of the profits of the fund, which is (mostly) other people's money. I don't see why those should be classified as capital gains when they're not making money as a result of their own investment. They're making money as a result of doing their jobs, and should be taxed on it just like everyone else. This won't affect how much investors put into VC funds, since that will still be classified as capital gains. It will just make working for a VC firm a little less profitable.<p>I don't see why VCs should be exempt from the rules everyone else has to play by.",1182646555

When I had Kaiser, it was excellent.  Blue Cross/Blue Shield, typically, has excellent coverage as well.  Don't know about Tonik.",1182644941

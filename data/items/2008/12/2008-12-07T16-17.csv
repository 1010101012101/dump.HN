388938,comment,388885,388885,0,0,vaksel,,,"Personally I believe in focus...you succeed by doing that one thing really really well. If you spread yourself in 10 different directions, you'll have ten different mediocre paths to mediocrity. Why? Because while you split your time between 10 different options, 10 different people will be spending 100% of their time, on each option.<p>Better to focus 110% on one thing...fail quickly(if its destined for failure), and go do something else.<p>as far as actual dating is concerned...who has the time really? If you were in a relationship before you started working on your startup, sure you might still keep it up(provided the woman is extremely understanding). But if you are just starting the whole process and are also focused on your startup...when do you even have the time to date?",1228668688

This would allow all the existing services to continue operating (user just has to change their password on the services to the API password) and would allow the user to generate a new API password when they wanted those services to stop.<p>OAuth is definitely a good thing to get to, but they aren't going to be able to turn off the access they are giving right now overnight when their OAuth implementation is done.",1228665629

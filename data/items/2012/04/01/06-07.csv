In the former case, you're starting from scratch. In the latter case, you've got your old alphabet confusing things.<p>Evidently, phonetic alphabets are possible; but for an adult to learn to use one it would take practice and effort, and many people would probably be fairly resistant to that (""our old one is perfectly good"", ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" etc.).",1333263138

3782991,comment,3781733,3782018,2,0,adrianhoward,,,"Agree completely with the agency problem. There are far too many folk who confuse the agency model of doing design with the way design is done. It's one of the reasons that the Lean UX community of practice get some bad press in parts of the design community.<p>(Although the agency problem isn't really lack of iteration. Pretty much every design process is highly iterative. It's just that the agency folk do it by themselves and, usually, up front.)<p>I find the second point much less convincing. I know lots of folk who <i>love</i> doing long-term product work. I guess I see about the same short/long term work preferences as I do in the development community. You get to be a good designer by doing lots of <i>design</i>. As long as the in-house opportunity has that, you can attract designers if you're recruiting the right way.<p>From your last paragraph it sounds like you outsource most of the visual design work, and in-house things like interaction design, generative user research, user testing, etc.<p>That works well for some products (I'm guessing that what you're building is a B2B or B2C web or desktop app that uses a ""normal"" UI without unique interaction models, and with a market that isn't design focussed - but I could, of course, be way wrong there).<p>Other kinds of products really <i>need</i> in-house visual design skills - because not having them gets in the way of that rapid iteration that you so correctly identify as being essential (games, some kinds of mobile apps, products with custom interaction models, markets that are design focussed, etc.)",1333262944

C, Go, or just leverage Apple's Objective-C developer network ...<p>Where does this myth come from that you can only write Android programs in Java?  There is a Native Dev Kit (Google [Android NDK]) that provides a gcc cross compiler so you can write your app in any language gcc can compile.  It is quite possible to write an app without a single line of Java.<p>Heck there is even a company that lets you take your existing Objective C iOS app and compile it on Android (they have also implemented a lot of the iOS APIs).  See <a href=""http://www.apportable.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apportable.com</a><p>It is true that Android does have a lot of Java libraries, and especially for regular user interface type stuff you really would want to use that (eg ActionBar, the resources system, fragments).  But if you want a framebuffer and OpenGL then ignore that.",1333261012

If you put on a jacket and tie, for example, you are signifying to others that you take the occasion seriously, whatever that occasion may be.  If someone looks at you and interprets how you dress, they are not being superficial.  They are reading the message that you wrote. [...] Can one earn respect in other ways?  Certainly, and one should.

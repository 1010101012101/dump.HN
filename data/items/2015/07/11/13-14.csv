9869780,comment,9869316,9869316,0,0,WBrentWilliams,,,"I think the whole problem with the smoking debate is that neither side (pro and anti) are willing to embrace harm reduction, even though the market has introduced many methods to use nicotine and/or tobacco that, to one degree or another, do in fact reduce the harm caused by the manufactured cigarette.<p>The anit-smoking side views harm reduction as a movement that is completely against their efforts. To the anti-smoking side, vaping is the same as {cigarettes, cigars, pipes, shisha, snus, ...}. The anti-smoking side&#x27;s stated agenda is absolute eradication of tobacco use in any form, and they&#x27;ve hit all fronts just short of prohibition.<p>The pro-smoking side take a small-l liberal view: People should be able to use tobacco. Their problem with harm reduction is that harm reduction is also against their stated goals. While the pro-smoking side will happily embrace vaping, they view it as yet another way to enjoy tobacco.<p>In the meantime, people like their vices. As an exercise, re-write the Economist article, but substitute &quot;alcohol&quot; for &quot;tobacco&quot;. As I recall, there was such an article posted to HN that showed how journalism colors the perception of drugs by writing about alcohol use as if alcohol was a new drug, not a very old one.<p>Back to my point on harm reduction, I believe that sooner or later a stasis should be reached. Harm reduction will be embraced by both sides. I believe that the only way to reduce the negative effects of any substance use to a society is to teach the risks and the safest way to use the substance. I think that the end result will be an open market where the suppliers of the substance will sell their product in any way they can and a corresponding social pressure that pushes users towards more acceptable (less harmful) practices while supporting programs that allow for self-selected cessation.",1436623170

9869774,comment,9867465,9869291,0,0,jules,,,"It&#x27;s true that it was a discovery that Martin Lof identity types could have multiple inhabitants, but it&#x27;s a general principle of type theory that types can have multiple inhabitants (unlike in set theory, where propositions are just true). That this also applies to identity types in HoTT is a sign that something is going right.<p>Furthermore, from another perspective it&#x27;s &quot;obvious&quot; that identity types should have multiple inhabitants. There were two approaches to equality in type theory. One is Martin Lof identity types, which follow naturally from Leibniz&#x27; principle that A and B are equal then they are indistinguishable. The other is <i>defining</i> equality for each type on a case by case basis (pairs are equal if their components are equal, functions are equal if they give equal outputs, etc.), like in section 2.4 Equality of this paper: <a href=""http://www.andres-loeh.de/PiSigma/PiSigma.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.andres-loeh.de/PiSigma/PiSigma.pdf</a><p>In the latter approach it&#x27;s obvious that equality has multiple inhabitants, because it&#x27;s defined that way. For example we can define equality of unordered pairs as the type:<p><pre><code>    id_unordered_pair : (A,A) -> (A,A) -> Type\n    id_unordered_pair (a,b) (c,d) = (id_A a c)*(id_A b d) + (id_A a d)*(id_A b c)\n</code></pre>\ni.e. two unordered pairs (a,b) and (c,d) are equal if a=c and b=d or a=d and b=c.<p>This has two inhabitants even if id_A has only a single inhabitant. This approach naturally accommodates quotient types. The problem with it is that the type system has no idea that this is equality. It&#x27;s just another definition. The point of equality is that all functions respect equality (equal inputs to equal outputs). Not all functions respect equality on these unordered pairs (e.g. a function that extracts the first component).<p>This approach to equality has the converse of Leibniz&#x27; rule: we can define equality so that if two things are indistinguishable then they are equal.<p>I think a good view of HoTT is as unifying these two approaches to equality. We get both Leibniz&#x27; principle and its converse, and we get user defined equality types whose equality <i>is</i> respected by all functions, we get multiple inhabitants for equality types.",1436622971

If you&#x27;ve ever used apps on those devices, you can plainly see why nobody would install anything onto them. I&#x27;m not going to cite average numbers of apps installed, because those stats fluctuate wildly and are typically bullshit. They also don&#x27;t help substantiate usage.<p>Windows Phone isn&#x27;t only unsuccessful because of the lack of significant applications, but acting like it isn&#x27;t a major factor is just being wilfully blind to reality. Microsoft can&#x27;t just endlessly throw money at the problem. They can&#x27;t buy their way into popularity if there is no organic momentum that follows, and there isn&#x27;t.<p>Windows Phone overall fails to make a compelling argument. But having backseat YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter clients and no SnapChat or other similarly flourishing services until it&#x27;s so late nobody cares anymore is a substantial disadvantage.<p>Finally, that statistic you chose to offer is almost irrelevant. I probably install less than one app a month on my Macs, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the apps I&#x27;ve already installed aren&#x27;t extremely important to me. Just because people aren&#x27;t constantly hunting for new apps doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t use the ones they have.<p>By that measure, the fact that I&#x27;ve only installed one password manager in five years means I don&#x27;t like or use password managers.

Averaged, most people around the world grew up with Windows. Heck even in third world countries and remotest part of the world, people are more familiar with Windows (a commercial product) than Linux (a zero cost free product). Windows given its monopoly also has a better support for programs and drivers. Keep in mind people do tend to look at desktop the same way you look at mobile: &quot;Windows phone - had terrible apps, and didn&#x27;t have half the features of my friends&#x27; iPhones and Androids.&quot;<p>There is also another thing, the true cost of Windows is hidden within the price of the hardware. When you purchase a laptop or commercial desktop, you dont pickup a cd for Windows or pay for it separately at the checkout. Thus for most people Windows is technically &quot;free&quot;.<p>Sure I can install Linux on my gf&#x27;s computer but most likely she wouldn&#x27;t let me since its not worth her time to relearn an entire new operating system. It is the same argument with console gaming vs pc gaming. For some people, even if it means missing out on a better gaming experience, they just want to sit down and not fiddle with things. And that is with my gf who is my generation, I can&#x27;t even begin to imagine the horror of installing a different OS for my parents and constantly being phoned to walk them through trivial tasks.<p>> I dumped the phone after 1 year when it constantly crashed on me (Nokia Lumia 720),<p>I had quiet the opposite experience, Windows phone seemed to crash the least on me. I found it to be more fluid OS than anything else I have tried.",1436620750

By &quot;quantifying over all formulas&quot; I just meant that one has to distinguish between the following two statements:<p>1. The law of excluded middle holds for a particular formula p.<p>2. The law of excluded middle holds for _all_ formulas p.<p>Also note that &quot;formula&quot; just means &quot;formal logical statement&quot;, i.e. structured string consisting of v, ==>, and so on.<p>What do you mean by &quot;perspective of totality&quot;?<p>Regarding your first edit: There is indeed a metatheorem which says &quot;any classical proof can be turned into a constructive proof&quot;. The catch is that this does _not_ apply to all formulas (of course, else the discussion would be moot), but only to formulas of a special kind. Not many formulas are of this kind, but for instance &quot;There exist infinitely many prime numbers&quot; and &quot;A particular Turing machine halts&quot; are (when suitably formulated). If you want to lookup the details, look for &quot;Friedman&#x27;s Trick&quot;.<p>That the implication (~p ∨ p) ⇒ (¬¬p ⇔ p) holds is because there is a direct proof of this. I didn&#x27;t show (here or in the slides) that the reverse implication is not intuitionistically valid. A simple way to do this would be to proceed along your lines, that is construct a Heyting algebra in which (¬¬p ⇔ p) holds for a particular element p but in which (~p v p) does not holds for this p. A fancier way would be to look at toposes arising &quot;in nature&quot;, not specifically constructed for giving a counterexample.<p>Thanks for the book recommendation! I&#x27;ll check it out.

Algorithms help, but people always need to be involved, and that&#x27;s problematic. It can be hard to find people that want to be exposed to this material as their full-time job, and it&#x27;s a liability headache.

They have a number of programs for submitting evidence, they&#x27;re actually quite easy-to-use, and they are cooperative if you follow their rules.

Frankly, this means that certain people have noticed that your site is not as good at identifying, flagging, and reporting this content, so they&#x27;re gravitating to you, having been kicked out of facebook, etc. That&#x27;s fine in the short term, in the long term it&#x27;s unsustainable from a business and legal perspective. Either you&#x27;ll need to devote more resources to fighting this (instead of development, marketing, more interesting things), and find a way to attract more legitimate users, or you will become the next attractive target for legal issues.<p>This is not a simple problem that can be solved with mechanical turk, an algorithm, etc. It&#x27;s a never-ending game of cat and mouse, walls and ladders, and a fundamental problem to be dealt with on any site that allows sharing.

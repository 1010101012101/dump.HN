4964546,comment,4963838,4964512,3,0,jacquesm,,,"> You're so off it's not even funny.<p>Nothing you wrote contradicts a single word I wrote.<p>Whether instagram is for profit or not has nothing to do with their agreement with their users. Copyright applies, no matter whether you upload your data to a free service or to a paid one. In the case of instagram, part of your 'payment' is that you sign away rights. If you're not comfortable with that then you should not use their service (I'm not, and I don't. Ditto FaceBook).<p>As far as the users are concerned instagram is a free service. If you wish to redefine the word free in creative, new and exciting ways then you'll be having a very interesting conversation, but mostly with yourself. We define words in a certain way so that we can have a meaningful conversation. Instagram is a free service by the generally accepted definition of the word free.<p>On their homepage they write:<p><pre><code>  ""Oh yeah, did we mention its free?""\n</code></pre>\nIt seems as though your not in agreement with that, maybe you are talking about a different company, the one I'm talking about lives at <a href=""http://www.instagram.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.instagram.com/</a> and does not have a paid program.<p>> Second, ""voting with your feet"" is what you do a priori. This suit involves people who already have a relationship with Instagram, have already shared their personal information, and are asserting that Instagram's new policies violate the understanding of the original transaction.<p>Yes, so they now have the option to remove their data from the service and to deny instagram the right to the use of that data. If they continue to use it (and I think that this is where there is a very subtle point of law involved, which is that you can't just retro-actively change the terms of service and claim that if people don't remove their data that they are accepting your new terms of service) then they are implicitly in agreement with the new terms. Obviously, there are some cases where this will lead to trouble:<p>- people won't re-read the terms past the point where they originally signed up on the off-chance that someone pulled a bait and switch (instagram specifically prompts you in their terms-of-service to review the terms periodically for changes)<p>- people may be incapacitated (or even dead) (instagram has a process for dealing with that)<p>- such retro-active changes may be illegal depending on the jurisdiction (but adding a clause about continued use past changes in the terms of service will certainly not hurt and of course instagram has just such a clause in place)<p>Whatever the case, the only way you'll get that settled is by suing them directly over an infringement of the copyright on your content uploaded under the original terms. Doing that pre-emptively is weird, ineffective and serves only one purpose, to give the lawyers that are promoting this class action suit free publicity. This will go absolutely nowhere.<p>Lawsuits over non-specifics that have not taken place, that you can avoid and that may never take place without specific damages are not good candidates for class-action.<p>> Third, yes lawsuits are a ""cost of doing business"" in the U.S. but comparing it to Switzerland is comparing apples and oranges.<p>For a multi-national this is everyday life. They compare the cost of doing business from country to country and this factors into pricing the product.<p>> The Swiss have far more regulation and government oversight of companies than in the U.S. European countries in general set detailed standards and guidelines for consumer products and services, while the U.S. prefers to handle such things through litigation.<p>Indeed. Whether or not that is the better way is up for grabs. But class action lawsuits on free services <i>before</i> actual infringement takes place is a load of bull.<p>The one thing that I don't get is why people are still surprised over things like this. It's par for the course, and has been for more than a decade now.",1356393467
4964545,comment,4964355,4964355,8,0,mtgx,,,"The problem is Intel has already lost on the performance side. Intel has always needed 3 things to beat ARM, and they need all 3 to be competitive: performance, energy efficiency, price.<p>With Atom, they've <i>always</i> had the performance advantage. In fact they've had a big advantage over ARM at the time when when Atom came out. It was like several times more powerful than the ARM chip inside iPhone 3G.<p>But to be competitive, Intel needed to compete on the other 2  levels, as well. So they kept Atom's performance mostly the same, while they tried over the years to push Atom down from a 10W TDP. But while Intel tried to lower the power consumption, ARM's chips were gaining in performance - faster than Intel. So now when Intel has finally reached parity with ARM in energy efficiency, ARM has surpassed it in performance with Cortex A15, and from what I've seen so far, by a lot.<p>Then there's also the pricing issue. I think they've improved there quite a bit. An Atom chip used to be close to $100. Now it's probably more like $40-$50 (this dual core version). But that's still like at least 50% more than an ARM chip.<p>So Intel still has a lot of catching up to do in ""overall competitiveness"", because right now it looks like they've only switched the much bigger performance leadership for ""energy efficiency parity"", and are losing at the other two. I'd like to see how high they are willing to go with Atom on performance, until they realize that it's going to cannibalize their Core i3 market.",1356393450

It's rare for a U.S. government entity to really launch an investigation into a dangerous product or a company that is abusing consumers. The model here is for Congress to pass laws and agencies to write regulations, but for those laws and regulations to be enforced by private litigation. It's really only in the areas of securities or anti-trust that you have vigorous government investigation and enforcement of violations of the law. Even when it comes to things like drugs in violation of regulations, in the U.S. we depend on class action lawsuits brought by people who are injured.",1356393171

Samsung's ATIV Smart PC uses an Atom Z2760 and features a 30Wh battery with an 11.6-inch 1366x768 display. Microsoft's Surface RT uses NVIDIA's Tegra 3 powered by a 31Wh battery with a 10.6-inch, 1366x768 display. In our 2013 wireless web browsing battery life test we showed Samsung with a 17% battery life advantage, despite the 3% smaller battery. Our video playback battery life test showed a smaller advantage of 3%.""  It is worth also noting that they are comparing this years intel with last years ARM.  Also worth noting that it is also a smaller CPU process of around 25% in Intels favour.<p>Now nothing stopping Intel doing ARM chips down the line or indeed doing some hybrid chip.  They have many cards they can play if they don't get the sales they want.<p>I would love the day when you could get a motherboard and the current Intel and ARM chips are pin compatable so you could drop what you like in, wouldn't that be a wonderful dream.",1356393122

I'm still on the fence about it.<p>I own more than one business and we also do work for other businesses, so, generally speaking, the ""Data"" drive holds business data partitioned-off into appropriately-named directories.<p>I also have what I call ""support"" directories there.   For example, I have a ""SolidWorks Support"" directory with models, macros, tools and other items that are there to support work with that software.  The same is true of Photoshop, Altium Designer, Web Design and other segmentable tasks.<p>Then there's more mundane stuff, like ""Digital Photography"", ""Personal"", ""Scans"", ""Temp"", ""Outlook Data"", etc.<p>Projects started to kind of pollute the data drive in some form.  Also, the directory hierarchy started to become a little crazy.  For example:<p><pre><code>    D:\<company name>\Projects\<project name>\Design\Mechanical\<project work folder>\Suppliers\n    D:\<company name>\Clients\<client name\...\n</code></pre>\nEven there were hardware, embedded and web projects with their own requirements.  And, even though we use Git, I still have the habit of making full copies of directories every so often to freeze thing in time.  With projects such as Solidworks mechanical designs or some electronics designs using source control can be painful, so, full backup copies of work directories works very well.  Storage is cheap.<p>At one point I thought that I should segregate active development from finished or shipping product.  In other words, make a distinction between ""project"" and ""product"".  That's why I introduced the ""Develpment"" drive.<p>There's another reason.  When doing FEA thermal and/or flow simulation for various projects the Data drive started to become clogged-up with simulation data.  As you navigate through many iterations of design ideas and simulations you can easily fill-up gigabytes.  I didn't think that this belonged anywhere near the ""Data"" drive.<p>Finally, some tools (Xilinx ISE back then) did not take kindly to paths with spaces.  So I always had to have a separate folder for Xilinx projects which has always bothered me.<p>This ""Development"" drive now allows me to create a simple folder with a short path:<p><pre><code>    Z:\ProjectA\n</code></pre>\nThis ""feels"" simpler and it ""feels"" like the right way to do it.<p>I also have an ""xampp-sites"" folder on there for web projects.  The projects can live in their own directories in the ""Development"" drive:<p><pre><code>    Z:\TheNextFacebook\n    Z:\TheNextGoogle\n</code></pre>\nThese have full source control, work folders and generally contain all the work resources for a project (for example a Photoshop work directory).  The ""xampp-sites"" directory is setup as the testing server and only sees an upload of the files that would normally go to the real production server (easy to do with tools such as Dreamweaver --which is never used in design mode here!).<p>Once a ""project"" graduates to being a ""product"" it is zipped-up and copied or moved into a ""Products"" folder under the appropriate company directory in the ""Data"" drive.  As an example, if we are talking about an iOS project it turns into a product once it is submitted to the app store and approved.<p>The jury is still out on whether or not this is a good idea or simply a reflection of being insanely anal about organizing data.  I don't know.  I am always open to new and interesting ideas on this front.  I try to think of the ""Development"" drive as a dirty or work drive of sorts where I can mess with a lot of things without polluting the ""Data"" drive.

4964472,comment,4961340,4962854,6,0,tel,,,"As others have pointed out, the example is a less defensible choice since the type has already been specialized. Polymorphic types (quantified theorems) begin to greatly restrict the number of programs (proofs) down to the point where you sometimes get ""free theorems"" such as those discovered by Djinn. For instance<p><pre><code>    foo :: forall a b. a -> b -> a\n</code></pre>\nis inhabited by precisely one program<p><pre><code>    foo a b = a\n</code></pre>\nFurthermore, you have the opposite effect such as the nonexistence of functions with types like<p><pre><code>    freeCoerce :: forall a b. a -> b\n</code></pre>\nThe best you can do is write<p><pre><code>    safeCoerce :: forall a b. a -> Maybe b\n</code></pre>\nwhich sometimes works but is allowed to fail if the coercion isn't possible.<p>---<p>Taking this to a logical extreme you can extend a Hindley-Milner type system to include dependent types and then construct meaningful types (theorems) which are only inhabited by correct and obvious programs. For instance, this Agda type<p><pre><code>    sort : List a -> Sorted a\n</code></pre>\nmaps lists not just to other lists but instead the type of sorted lists guaranteeing the meaning of the function 'sort'.<p>---<p>Obviously any static typing system inherits a bit of this power. There's no doubt that reading the signature of a C++ function will help you to make educated guesses at what's going on. Furthermore, a malicious Haskell library implementor  could use the ""unsafe"" family of functions to create something like 'coerce' or a function that has impure side-effects but doesn't end up in the IO monad. There is some amount of trust that libraries do not abuse such unsafe commands and the IO monad can be guaranteed to isolate impure effects---but so long as that isn't violated, the types can be incredibly informative.<p>---<p>It's also worth noting that Haskell does have ""bottom"" inhabiting every type, similar to null but denoting infinite loops instead of null values. So you actually can write coerce without using 'unsafe' commands like<p><pre><code>    coerce :: a -> b\n    coerce _ = let bot = bot in bot</code></pre>",1356391807

It is used on SSD, HDD (SATA and USB), RAID 0, RAID 1 and over dmcrypt.  The only place I do not use it is one filesystem for MongoDB, and it would probably work fine there too if I disabled COW.<p>The builtin checksums (and scrub) functionality are crucial to me.  I had a drive start to fail with ext4 and the only reasonable way to do a scrub would be to take it offline which I calculated would take 23 hours (plus a huge amount of extra work to map bad sectors back to relevant files).  At some point a failed sector had also lead to ext4 giving back zeroes when the containing file was copied.  btrfs has two copies of metadata by default so an unfortunately placed bad sector is less likely to wipe out knowledge of entire trees or files (happened to me with ext4 as well when a directory disappeared).<p>The volume management is great too.  It is really easy to add and remove devices/partitions without having to take systems down, change between raid levels etc.  You can do the same thing with LVM (which I was using before) but it is a lot of fiddly work to get the right commands and options, plus deal with physical and logical.  It is one command to add or remove a partition with btrfs and it is trivial to work out what the command is from 'btrfs --help'.  (LVM requires several different commands to be run which I always had to lookup and often had a lot of difficulty with such as running RAID 0 with partitions of different sizes.)  btrfs also only does operations on the actual used portions.  eg if I change from RAID0 to RAID1 on a filesystem where I am using 1GB of 1TB space then it will only worry about that 1GB not the whole 1TB.  LVM can't see into the filesystem to know what is actually used.<p>I have compression (LZO) turned on everywhere.  You can't (currently) find out how effective it has been, but I do have a lot of data files that are highly compressible (eg CSV files, SQL dumps).  It is more convenient to have them expanded than to teach every single program that accesses them how to decompress on the fly.<p>I used to use rsync and hard links to make snapshots.  These completely hammered the machine when run causing large amounts of I/O since all metadata has to be scanned plus all changed/new files.  Consequently I only made daily snapshots.  With btrfs making snapshots is virtually instantaneous and is unaffected by how much data has changed, size of volume, I/O speeds etc.  I now make snapshots hourly.<p>Ultimately I have things such that I will proactively find out about bad sectors and similar low level corruption, have snapshots to deal with issues over time, and have data replicated over machines (mostly via Dropbox and git/hg), both local and remote.  I am not relying on the filesystem of any one machine to always be perfect.<p>> Also, since you seem to be knowledgeable about Linux, why do you use Dropbox at all, instead of just git or rsync or scp or whatever?<p>Because Dropbox just works.  Many of the alternatives haven't figured that out yet, assuming they even support Linux.  The importance of actually working can't be overstated.  It also requires no administration or maintenance.  Sync automatically happens when machines are on and there is appropriate network connectivity without requiring any baby sitting from me.<p>I use git/hg for source which is their sweet spot.  Using something like rsync is a pain once you have more than two machines, and it requires a full blown system accessible offsite for an offsite copy which is yet more administration and maintenance.<p>git/rsync/scp aren't usable from mobile devices.  I do things like put documents, ebooks, photos, and music into dropbox which makes them be present on everything, no messing around needed.  Dropbox behaves very much like DVCS for that kind of content doing an N-way sync, having a history (you can get last 30 days by default, more if you pay more or use a team account).<p>Finally Dropbox allows collaboration.  You can easily share files and directories.  I can do a software build for Android, put the APK in a shared folder and a colleague can install the app on their device without hassle.  Various tools run periodic reports and put their output in shared folders which makes it available to everyone even if they then happen to jump on a plane.",1356390594

Drag and drop is great if you want to share a bunch of images, but if you're just uploading a screen shot for someone to quickly review or what have you, having to stop what you're doing, open yet another window, browse to the folder, drag browser windows around so that you can then select the photo and drag it into the browser is significantly slower than just clicking a browse button, selecting the image, and clicking upload.<p>Drag and drop is pretty idiot-proof, and for bulk uploads, it's faster, but for single images and multi-tasking users, it can actually be a lot slower.<p>Having both options would be ideal.",1290415343

It's not so good if there are many users making a lot of changes to data (like facebook). But it's very interesting for applications when few users make changes on site and site looks like static for rest of visitors (applications like any CMS). And we are getting a lot of cool git features for free.",1290413524
1929090,comment,1927552,1928664,0,0,sb,,,"Regarding your Ruby example and the tracing JIT VM. I think the efforts of Mozilla regarding the TraceMonkey/JaegerMonkey efforts show that while tracing is indeed a very good optimization technique, it is not by all means clear that it performs well on <i>all</i> benchmarks, particularly when compared to V8, which is a traditional method-at-a-time JIT compiler.<p>While I agree that there is nothing special about bytecode, interpreting it is regarded to be faster than AST interpreters. AFAIR, I read a paper about that, too, but cannot for the love of god remember its name/authors; also my impression is that Ruby 1.9 uses a bytecode interpreter (with some optimizations, such as direct threaded code interpreter).",1290413417

<a href=""http://simplenoteapp.com/about/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://simplenoteapp.com/about/</a>
I love their app and I'm really curious to how their experience with App Engine has been.<p>___<p>As far as my personal experience goes, I just learned Python/AppEngine a couple weeks ago, and within a day or two I wrote a ""random button"" for a blog I like:<p><a href=""http://www.iwrotethisforyou.me/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iwrotethisforyou.me/</a>
(If you look at the URL of the ""random post"" link on the right, it goes to my appengine app)<p>From what I've read, there really is a certain ""style"" of app that fits well with GAE, namely one that fits within their requirements. Simplenote may just be the prime example of that. Also it has close integration with Google services (Blogger, Picasa, etc) which is what allowed me to so easily pull data from that blog with my app.<p>I personally see it as a great choice for Android (and possibly iPhone) Developers looking to serve a lightweight and easily scalable backend to support their mobile devices. I say Android because each Android device required a Google login, which will authenticate easily with App Engine. This is what I'm planning to do as a next step for my Android App.",1290413212

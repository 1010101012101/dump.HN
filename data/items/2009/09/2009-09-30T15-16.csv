However that's still part of the test.  Given two students whose understanding is the same, the one who is better prepared for the other parts of the test will have more time for the ""conceptual"" section and therefore will likely perform better there as well.<p>That is assuming the unlikely proposition that preparing for the test doesn't directly prepare you for the conceptual portion of the test.  I say unlikely because test makers have been trying to make such tests (eg the SAT) for decades, and test preparation companies (eg Kaplan) have been demonstrating that you can prepare for them after all.<p>You can't escape the circularity.  If you're measuring performance with a test, then you can't really distinguish preparation for the test from actual performance.  In this study they had much stronger results in their second year, than their first.  Which strongly suggests that teachers did a better job of preparing for the test after teachers saw the tests that would be used.",1254326163

My theory on this is that people that haven't grown up (at least during their childhood and/or teenage years) with many people of a certain race won't end up finding most of the 'feature' characteristics of that race to be attractive (i.e. if you grow up in a mostly white neighborhood you might not find black women attractive).<p>I could be completely off-base here. I have no idea how the development of attraction in the brain works (and I'm sure there's probably much research into this area of psychology). But I tend to find that a lot of people (whether they admit to it or not) have a preference for certain races and not others. Sometimes people don't have a preference for their own race. I know Asian women that are not attracted at all to Asian men, but that doesn't stop them from having Asian men as friends and interacting with them. I would hardly think that they are bigoted against Asians (seeing as they <i>are</i> Asian themselves).<p>> <i>What I've found from personal experience, is that the bar is set much higher for those minority races.</i><p>It's not necessarily minority races. There are plenty of people that are not attracted to others of their own race. 'Yellow-fever,' 'jungle-fever,' etc weren't created for 'one-off' instances (i.e. the person accused of having 'the fever' only dated a person of that race once, and doesn't have an affinity to dating persons of that race) of inter-racial dating/mating/marriage.",1254325759

852625,comment,850898,851116,0,0,dstorrs,,,"I think it's more about opportunity cost.  Look at startups:  most first-time entrepreneurs are <25 because that age range generally have very low opportunity costs; they live with parents, in a dorm, or in low-cost apartments in less than ideal areas.  Their mainstream earning potential is low, so entrepreneurship doesn't mean giving up (a chance at) a high-paying job.  They have no spouse or kids, so they don't need to worry about how their choices will influence their immediate family.<p>Also, young people generally lack experience, which means their risk assessments are off--they think things are easier than they are, because they don't have similar experiences to compare to.  When there is almost no cost, and the perceived risk is low or moderate, entrepreneurship is the rational choice.<p>This is all exactly reversed for the majority of people in my age range (30+).  We have high opportunity costs, and we have enough similar experiences that we can make more accurate risk assessments--we know just how much work will be involved, we know the (low) percentage of companies that actually succeed.  With high(er) perceived risk and high opportunity costs, it is rational not to go entrepreneur.<p>(And then there are those of us 30-somethings for whom entrepreneurship is enough fun that we are willing to structure our lives to make it possible.  :>)<p>The moral?  It isn't that the people you know are beaten down.  It's that they are reasonably happy.  Be happy for them.",1254324939

Their height difference could simply be down to him being in the US for a long period of time, I know having been to the US and currently living in Canada that any trip back to the UK means major sleep problems, I'm up either majorly late or direly early. Could it simply be that he gets up far earlier than his brother (British culture is notably more 9-5 than NA culture, where 7-3 is highly noticeable, at least here in Ontario)? Would the increase weight mean faster compression of his vertebrae or even excess compression compared to his twin?<p>Not to mention posture and everything else, including flat-footedness (which IIRC can attribute a decrease of about 1/2 inch in height due to a posture shift), which again could have been induced by excess weight. Both twins could be genetically prone to flat feet, but the shorter one simply gained weight and increase the strain leading to a collapse earlier in life.<p>Perhaps this is DNA methylation, but I'd bet anything that a mixture of diet, exercise and physical health are greater contributing factors to divergent physical characteristics in identical twins.

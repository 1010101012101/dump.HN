First time posting.<p>I recently launched a private beta of my weekend project (easyretirementplanning.ca if you want to provide some feedback!), and now I'm unsure of what to do next.<p>The folks I've had try it out had positive reviews, and a number of suggestions that I can implement over the next little while.  My question is what is next?  How do I decide whether or not to take this to the next level?<p>As this is a financial services application, there are significant legal & regulatory hoops I will have to jump through prior to charging for the product.  Not that I don't have the drive/interest to do so, I just don't want to put even more time behind something that may not take off.<p>I suppose in one sentence - ""how do I determine from a private beta if I have anything even resembling product/market fit""?<p>Thanks!!",1345474719

Their move to the 64-bit world was painfully slower than what their fellow merchants accomplished in the Unix bazaar. They still provide compatibility layers for programs built with technologies that have been thought of as extinct, like monks still praying to the gods of ancient Greece. Whenever they went for the ""total reuse"" mantra, they built terrible and insecure specifications (DCOM) that still saddle us 20 years later.

Congratulations!<p>- I don't think I understand what your product offers. From reading your website, I imagine something similar to Wikipedia (only about software development). Am I close? If so, I think you need to do a better job of communicating your value statement. If not, I think you need to work a little on explaining what you do and how you're different.<p>- My biggest criticism about your site is related to your slider. You have a lot of text on the first slide, but I think it changes to the next slide too fast. If I were you, I'd increase the delay.<p>- Personally, I always feel a little uneasy about including somewhat related quotes from famous people (unless of course, they're talking about your product). While social proof is undeniably important, I worry that somewhat related quotes devalue brands. If I were you, I'd test this (and blog about your results!)<p>- You should run a test on your pricing page. I suspect that the FAQs you have on the bottom will reduce your conversions, but that also would be an interesting test. If I were you, I'd remove all the FAQs (but add 'no contracts to sign' into your list of features).<p>- I'm concerned about word of mouth, (specifically conversations like this) --> ""My pointy haired boss told us to write the app in Rails.

Congratulations!<p>- I don't think I understand what your product offers. From reading your website, I imagine something similar to Wikipedia (only about software development). Am I close? If so, I think you need to do a better job of communicating your value statement. If not, I think you need to work a little on explaining what you do and how you're different.<p>- My biggest criticism about your site is related to your slider. You have a lot of text on the first slide, but I think it changes to the next slide too fast. If I were you, I'd increase the delay.<p>- Personally, I always feel a little uneasy about including somewhat related quotes from famous people (unless of course, they're talking about your product). While social proof is undeniably important, I worry that somewhat related quotes devalue brands. If I were you, I'd test this (and blog about your results!)<p>- You should run a test on your pricing page. I suspect that the FAQs you have on the bottom will reduce your conversions, but that also would be an interesting test. If I were you, I'd remove all the FAQs (but add 'no contracts to sign' into your list of features).<p>- I'm concerned about word of mouth, (specifically conversations like this) --> ""My pointy haired boss told us to write the app in Rails. He read about Rails on Hackerfly."" Snark like this can be very expensive to extinguish. This concern could also be an amazing opportunity to build a community where engineers and managers can get together and have frank conversations about technology and working together.<p>Good luck with your product and sorry this isn't more detailed!<p>Greg",1345473965

That said, if I were a manager responsible for 10 ongoing projects at any time, I'd be very interested.<p>- About the pricing, the one thing that bothers me is that I have no idea what a ""technology category"" is, and how much do I actually need. I have no idea if 5 is enough or not. Maybe you explained this and I missed it. Maybe a demo would help picture what it is. It's up to you to figure it out, but as far as I'm concerned, I spent over 3 mins on the (otherwise very appealing) website and did not find the info.<p>That said, I think it's a good idea, and while I have no clue whether it's a profitable one (or how you should proceed to make it so), I think it's a really cool project capable of providing real value.

For example, this quote argues a correlation between copying and innovation, and hints at a causation:<p>>Being copied didn't stop or slow their ability to innovate at all. If anything, it only seemed to accelerate it. Apple wasn't able to rest on its laurels; to return to profitability, and to take the mantle they hold today of one of the technology industry's largest companies, they had to innovate as fast as they could.<p>I'd be the first to agree that an open, competitive market is a good thing. But the author is explicitly discussing ""copying"", which usually involves an infringement of IP a company considers novel and important to their competitive advantage. I wouldn't say the author's point is completely without merit, there's a balance at play. If the balance goes too anti-patent, companies would be better off investing very little in innovation and a lot in copy-cat products that can undercut true innovators.

4407739,comment,4406224,4406550,1,0,edwinnathaniel,,,"You pointed one module, as an example that describes the whole Spring as one unified framework.<p>Spring consists of multiple modules that you absolutely _don't_ have to use. This is where, I think, you misunderstood Spring.<p>When it comes to the modules, i.e.: Spring Core, Spring Transaction, Spring-Data sub-modules, Spring eventually use the JDK and/or 3rd-party API (possibility, in the case of Neo4J etc). Yes, you can use JDBC, JTA, JPA, and Neo4J API directly. For sure. But Spring has always wanted to become an alternative to using them directly by providing more features and supposedly better programming experience.<p>This is what I meant by _glue_. You're absolutely correct: you can use those libraries directly without Spring. But if Spring modules provide me with better programming model, more features on top of barebone implementations, why would I not use Spring modules? This, again, something that you seem don't quite see from Spring.<p>Let's say MVC is a buzzword and start from there. If you look at ASP.NET MVC and Rails MVC, they provide a programming model where you have a request mapper/route that maps a request to a method in your controller.<p>MVC Model 2 architecture does not provide you with that. MVC Model 2 architecture provides you 1:1 mapping between a URL with Servlet. Which means if you do a simple CRUD a'la Resource, you can either have 1 Servlet  per Resource that acts as a dispatcher for the CRUD operation via either query parameters or multiple Servlets. Again, if you choose to live with that, that's your choice.<p>Spring offers a better programming model than MVC Model 2 architecture and there are people out there that prefer it. Spring also offers WebFlow, a module on top of Spring-MVC that helps building Wizard or Shopping Chart that involves lifecycle/steps. Can you live without it? For sure. Roll your own.<p>That's one, second, in Rails MVC, you can set the content negotiation to send back either JSON, XML, or HTML. You can do this with JAX-RS but that is a separate ""servlet"" per-se. If you want your API to live in a different part of your systems, this is acceptable. But if you want all of the request comes from one entry-point, you have to work harder than that.<p>Calling Spring as a 'Bug Layer' reminds me of this article:<p><a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/03/the-first-rule-of-programming-its-always-your-fault.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/03/the-first-rule-of-p...</a>",1345472867

You can complain about it all you want, but there is a reason that people are fundamentally attracted to it.<p>I think you're right about a lot of things, but if you propose rebuilding Paris, well, you may have some opposition.

I reported one or two clear issues upstream and they have been fixed, but until the relevant fixes arrive at the projects (especially PHP came with an old version of autotools), some time will pass.<p>You know that you can replace config.guess and/or libtool with updated versions? Or run make -f Makefile.cvs to regenerate configure etc. from aclocal.m4?<p>And I would argue that the fact that you had the option of writing a Makefile is itself an advantage of autoconf, because it was written to generate Makefiles in exactly the kind of layering cruft that the OP is complaining about. A more ""cathedrally"" solution would probably have replaced Makefiles entirely, but by having autoconf generate them it makes it possible for people who know make to, in extremis, edit the generate files.<p>>As a counter-example, take i3-wm: it ships with a GNU Makefile (OK, multiple Makefiles in subdirectories, one for each tool) and compiles on Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD.<p>Last time we had a post from the same guy I offered up two challenges: a) cross-compile the program for ARM, b) build the program on a version of SUA (the windows posix compatibility layer) that didn't even exist when the program was released. Both of these are things I can and have done trivially with autoconf-based builds; for most projects it requires no editing of files at all, just replacing config.guess with the latest version for challenge b. I'd be interested to see how building i3-wm was in those two cases (though not interested enough to go to the effort of actually doing it).",1345471928

The result provides the connectivity (and centralized web page installation) of a web application while still giving users the speed and responsiveness of desktop software.<p>Since the client apps use Java Web Start for operation, we were able to reuse an established desktop Java code base in the SaaS system which had already been created for a standard licensed model.  The additional development to shift things to the cloud was relatively minimal and the common code base also made it easy for us to continue with a self-installed licensed system in parallel with the hosted SaaS option.<p>If you have a set of Java applications operating with a desktop one-time-charge licensing model and are wondering how you might add a SaaS business model to that mix, taking a look at Java Web Start might be worth your while.

The other reviewers were caught up in the minutia of the paper, and missed the forrest for the trees: the method itself was more than a worthy enough contribution to the field to be accepted, and they were arguing about significance of the results. Over the course of the next couple of review rounds, this researcher's focus shifted from reviewing the paper to defending it to the other researchers. In the end, after multiple rounds (and likely a couple of years), the vote was 2-1 to reject. At this point the Senior Editor stepped in and published the paper without further revision.<p>Do we do the same with submissions here?<p>That conversation was hit me pretty hard, and I hope it will change the way I review.",1345471450

That's not very helpful, given that there is an entire book defining the concept (I belive it's available online on ESR's homepage, how about you read it ?)<p>Third: No, I'm not of the ""either you are with us, or you are against us"" persuation.   The bazaar is here to stay, but having everybody in need of transportation buy the necessary spareparts to build a car is insane.<p>Fourth: Related to point two really:  A lot of you seem to have little actual ambition of making things better, I guess that is what happens if you grow up in a bazaar and never even experience a cathedral.

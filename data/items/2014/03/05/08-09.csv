It&#x27;s very messy, and two defendants with the exact same facts can get widely disparate sentences.  A recent study from 2012 or 2013 revealed that judges were more likely to give harsh sentences after lunch than before lunch (controlling for race, criminal history, and other factors).<p><i>1028 imposes a maximum sentence of 15 years for the gravest crime listed in the statute.

The maximum sentence for these counts is 2 years for the crime charged.  (He was not charged with a terrorism offense under 1028A, so the 5 year sentence is not applicable.)  The way this statute is written, this 2 year sentence may not be concurrent to any other sentence for <i>any other crime</i> but multiple counts of the same crime can be served simultaneously.  (Note that 1028A is an &quot;enhancement&quot; charge, similar to the gun enhancements I mentioned earlier. They are add-ons to other crimes, and cannot be charged separately. Basically, enhancement charges are used when additional circumstances covered by the enhancement make the underlying crime &quot;worse&quot; than a normal instance of that crime.)<p>1028 imposes a maximum sentence of 15 years for the gravest crime listed in the statute.

For example, it can be cheaper to distribute from CloudFront versus straight from S3 for some use cases. Though, generally, you are not only looking at using CloudFront to save money over S3 ...there&#x27;s typically a performance reason.<p>And sometimes the hosting costs simply don&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s easy for us engineers - siting here on HN - to sit at our keyboards and play around with hypothetical ways to save money. This isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, but there are numerous things in IT that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to optimize. Why? Because the ROI on the engineering time, CapEx, and OpEx (and the time, energy, and focus of ANYONE involved or impacted at all) to do the optimization doesn&#x27;t outweigh the opportunity cost.<p>Sometimes there are simply better uses of our limited capital and time.<p>Not everything needs to be optimized. And the argument gets stronger when there are other factors more difficult to factor in: adopting a platform that isn&#x27;t as widely known or isn&#x27;t backed by a similar level of maturity (even with it&#x27;s quirks, at least they are well known), etc.<p>The risks/concerns not only vary between organizations, but often from one period of an organization&#x27;s growth to the next. The beauty is every organization gets to make their own decision ...and none of them have to give a damn if the HN community agrees or not. :-)",1394006611

For non-heinous crimes (i.e., crimes that aren&#x27;t rape or murder) prosecutors threaten the maximum sentence for the &quot;worst&quot; crime charged, and only that number, because any competent defense attorney would immediately let their client know that sentences wouldn&#x27;t be served consecutively.  This is true in most, but not all states as well.  (For heinous crimes, the consecutive sentences don&#x27;t matter; the defendant has already received a life sentence and the additional years are meaningless.)<p>This is also a legal ethics issue, since a prosecutor who fraudulently claims a higher maximum penalty during plea bargaining can be suspended or disbarred.  Cops can lie to you--prosecutor&#x27;s can&#x27;t. They have sworn an oath (to the bar) to be honest in their legal representations.  Prosecutors have been sanctioned, suspended, and even disbarred for being dishonest about sentencing because such dishonesty indicates moral turpitude that likely extends into other facets of their legal work.<p>It&#x27;s the media that throws around the 100-year numbers by adding together all of the potential individual sentences. It turns out that journalists aren&#x27;t very good at understanding technology, science, or the law.",1394006547

But it means I am available to comingle when it makes sense, available to be run into for at least a couple hours a day, and almost always home before traffic gets bad.

Usually I end up with the idea that everyone would work from &quot;home,&quot; and would be encouraged to use co-working (company-paid) if they wished; and I might maintain a minimal &quot;HQ&quot; assuming it was more than just me at that location; and I&#x27;d build in regular face-to-face team meetings into the business plan, say at least every quarter.<p>The only problem is, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want to work that way myself if I were an employee.  I think I&#x27;d want an office: preferably one to myself.<p>I currently work from home, and have previously rented office spaces (both shared and not) at my own expense; and at various times I&#x27;ve worked in the HQ, branch offices, and various combinations of all these things, for a few different tech-related companies.<p>I would probably rent another dedicated office right now, but my rental apartment has a guest room so it seems decadent. But I&#x27;m still tempted, and check the listings every couple of weeks.<p>I would say that for me, working in software development and also doing &quot;creative&quot; work, having a separate space easily made up in peace of mind and <i>probably</i> in productivity what it cost in money.  (In a high-rent zone like San Francisco that probably wouldn&#x27;t hold.)  But I found a coworking space too annoying, and probably would not go back to that if I could avoid it.<p>I found the big advantages to a rented space were, in order:<p>1. Freedom from distractions (usually; neighbors make noise too).\n2. Work-only nature of the space, i.e. you go there <i>only</i> to work.\n3. Ability to set it up as I like (decoration, layout, etc.).\n4. Got my butt out of the house and out amongst the humans more often.\n5. Your feelings about Home don&#x27;t get so mixed up with your feelings about Work.\n6. You can still opt to work from home when you really feel like it.<p>Disadvantages vs home office:<p>1. &quot;Shared resources&quot; (kitchen, bathroom, etc.) might not live up to your normal standards of utility or hygiene.\n2. Neighbors pay rent too, and are thus unlikely to change their habits at your request.\n3. Expense (though this is very location-dependent).\n4. Commute, while probably a good thing overall, eats time.\n5. Your landlord, like most landlords, may suck.<p>None of this in any way contradicts the idea of going all-in on remote teams, but it does raise a question: if you&#x27;re doing it for the competitive advantage of high productivity, might it be better to spend <i>more</i> on offices that are <i>themselves</i> distributed?<p>(FWIW: Married, no kids, and neither one of us works a 9-5 schedule.)",1455061334

The main questions are why and how to reach it. :)<p>The article surveys the field of enrichment programs and activities, many of which are available only to people in certain areas. I&#x27;ve witnessed the immense local impact of those outreach efforts, while visiting Math Circles, high schools, and academic competitions around the country. The people who lead those events (mostly after-hours or on weekends) are an incredible bunch, and many of them do it out of their passion for the subject.<p>However, I think we would all gain if we could engage everyone in math/science, no matter where they live. The success of these programs shows that interesting content increases interest! The Internet allows us to level the playing field, and scale the impact of free educational resources to the world.<p>I was once at a math education conference where groups were pitching ways to develop math talent. These programs sometimes need financial sponsorship from governments or foundations, so that they can remain accessible across socioeconomic lines. On the second morning of the conference, I suddenly thought: how much money does our public school system spend trying to teach soccer each year? (I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much.) It seems that many students achieve fairly high levels of proficiency regardless.<p>Of course, there is still much value in funding the current math education efforts, but that made me think about whether significant gains could come from finding out how to communicate educational content in the most engaging way. That would take a page from the startup playbook (optimizing for engagement).<p>So, I got my hands dirty. I launched a startup (expii.com) to crowdsource and rate free interactive lessons in math and science, to quantitatively evaluate an organized collection of these resources, distributed at scale across the world. The objective is to turn every smartphone into a pocket tutor, delivering the most engaging lessons produced by the combined creativity of the world.<p>That&#x27;s a big project. In the meantime, while the content is crowdsourcing, I also am broadcasting interesting nuggets of math each week at expii.com/solve (again free). These deliver the same topics I talk about in person at middle- and high-school math enrichment events around the country when I visit them to give guest talks: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sxVgJ_wPaM&feature=youtu.be&list=PLqv4sKOD1bsUoSs-SbzlA2BE1tML4A33u"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sxVgJ_wPaM&feature=youtu.be...</a><p>My thought process is that if I&#x27;m taking the time to develop the materials to deliver to only 200 people at a time, then we should harness the Internet to scale the distribution to the world, while also packaging the content in a fun way, to show to the mass audience why math is actually a very interesting subject. :)<p>Ultimately, I think that the global project to build interest and excellence in math is an enormous task, which needs the insight and hard work of a great multitude of people, and a diversity of ideas and approaches. Thanks to everyone who is pitching in on this mission! :)",1455060716

Now, imagine that everyone in your neighborhood is doing this.  Instead of the vast majority of your local community spending the vast majority of their time outside of the community, they will actually be present.  And they will all desire the natural human need for social contact.  I expect that this will result in a rebirth of the local community.  Long commutes, ever-growing work weeks, ever-shrinking vacation time has pretty much decimated the whole concept of a local community.  But when those things disappear, you&#x27;re going to end up with a lot of people wanting to get together and I&#x27;m sure they will eventually figure it out and block parties, back-yard barbecues, etc will become a regular occurrence.<p>Transitions are always fraught with difficulties, and I think the social contact issue with working from home is just one of the temporary ones as our society moves toward people working from home, most being self-employed.",1455060466

Humans have a difficulty, rooted in the fundamental structure of our brains, to hold both the benefits and the costs of a situation in mind at the same time.  Once we determine that something provides greater benefit than cost, the costs just disappear.  It&#x27;s a pragmatic shortcut, but it falls flat when the underlying assumptions change.<p>The underlying assumptions have changed.  The myriad costs associated with offices are no longer outweighed by the benefits they provide.

Our whole setup of how we work is based on manufacturing, and it hasn&#x27;t been adapted to the very different work being done now.

I believe TBC and WOTLK came out after Activision purchase and those expansions were great.<p>Those were my two favorite expansions. I quit when Cataclysm was released. That said, I recently resubscribed and have been enjoying playing it periodically. Unfortunately, the skill set &quot;crunch&quot; feels too much like the game mechanics have been dumbed down, sapping away the spirit of the game. I thought I liked the changes at first until I discovered they ripped out a ton of core class skills and pushed forward with some really bizarre decisions. (My girlfriend is playing a death knight, and she&#x27;s perplexed as to why only frost spec allows her to dual wield--almost as puzzled as I was to discover that shaman totems feel more like a bolted-on mechanic than they were before.)<p>But, I assume this change was an attempt to pull new people into the game and not leave it with a decidedly intimidating number of talents and spells. I liked it the way it was, some people didn&#x27;t, and that&#x27;s just the way things are, I suppose. Nostalgic folk aren&#x27;t the target demographic at this point, and while I think I can live with that, I&#x27;m still undecided if I&#x27;m going to continue my subscription after this month. MMOs seem to be in a race for the bottom, and I don&#x27;t really have the time anymore to invest in new ones.

I wouldn&#x27;t even care if I had to re-roll, but if I could level through all the expansions as I did before--the ones I enjoyed, anyway--or lock into one and play that content at the appropriate level, I&#x27;d happily pay the subscription indefinitely. Sure, there are private servers out there (requiring one to break the EULA) that attempt to recreate older versions at various points, but the quality varies so wildly they&#x27;re almost not worth it--legal issues and ethics aside.<p>Hey, I can dream. It won&#x27;t happen. It&#x27;d be too costly to implement with very little reward, and I doubt it&#x27;d bring back many of the older players who swore off the game due to whatever recent changes drove them away (possibly alienating the new players in the process). WoW is a cash cow now, so there&#x27;s unlikely to be any disruption that could threaten that income. Sadly.",1455059655

It would also make it sound like it&#x27;s compensating for not having an office, which I think is a net win for the people who are going to enjoy working at a company with a remote culture.",1455058877

Slack and IMs and video chat are great and all, but you can move way more information and have it be received much more clearly in person. There also can be a feeling of isolation, depending on how teams are structured and how many employees at the company are remote.<p>Also, there is no &quot;going to the bar after work for a couple beers&quot;, which for many is fine. But still humans require some measure of being physically near other humans, so you need to be much more proactive about socializing and seeing friends/family. If you aren&#x27;t diligent about this you can become kind of a hermit. If you have young kids this is probably not a big deal, you&#x27;d be too busy anyway.<p>Plus, like I mentioned before, you&#x27;re now on the hook for the office space. Working remotely can lead you to justify paying for more house or apartment than you otherwise would have, because &quot;well I need an extra room for my office&quot;. The freedom it affords is quite nice, so many would probably be fine with the extra outlay. But you should be clear about what you&#x27;re paying for, and why.",1455058800

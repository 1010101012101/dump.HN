6784884,comment,6783499,6784731,16,0,phaus,,,"I think you misunderstand that for a long time, Id Software has made a lot of money turning 3d engines into a commodity. For John Carmack, the emphasis has always been on developing new graphics technologies that advance the entire gaming industry. He&#x27;s first and foremost an engineer. He may have done a significant amount of game design back in the day, but for at least a decade he&#x27;s primarily been focused on pushing the hardware to its limits. Since Doom 3, Id&#x27;s games have pretty much been tech-demos for their engines. That&#x27;s not to say that Doom 3, Quake 4, and Rage weren&#x27;t good games, its just that none of them are truly memorable experiences like their older games were.<p>There are only a handful of major players that are making meaningful contributions to the world of 3d engines. If companies like Epic, Id, Valve, and Crytek didn&#x27;t continue to develop  new 3d engines, they wouldn&#x27;t be a commodity anymore.<p>Also, the Source, Unreal, Cry, and Id Tech 5 engines are still differentiated from one another enough to warrant all four of them existing.<p>In short, I don&#x27;t think 3d engines are a &quot;solved&quot; problem. Of course an indie studio looking to publish its first 3d game should obviously use a readily available engine, but the major studios still have good reasons to roll their own.",1385171752

If you can spend bitcoin out of an &quot;online wallet&quot;, the person in control of the software managing that wallet _does_ have access to your bitcoin. Even if they&#x27;ve tried to set things up &quot;securely&quot;, the very best they can do is achieve Lavabit levels of security - if they (or someone coercing them) wants to, they&#x27;ll get full access to your funds anytime you try to access them.<p>Think of them as like keeping your change on the bar - the security relies _purely_ on social conventions encouraging the bar owner, bar staff, other customers, and your friends to not take your money.<p>You would no more store your weekly pay, your rent money, or your new car savings on the counter at a bar - why the hell are people storing those sorts of values of bitcoin in other people&#x27;s webservices?<p>Sure, online wallets might be _useful_, but anyone keeping any more value than they can afford to lose in one is insane (or, less critically, very poorly informed).",1385171690

I had already written a game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and here it is now with a grand total of zero lines of code.<p>After reading theaqua&#x27;s post, I couldn&#x27;t sleep. I was agonized by insomnia, so I gathered myself and sat down to re-write the game. Mindful that I had to use exactly zero lines of JavaScript, I was very scared. Writing a program in 1000 lines or more is no problem. But writing zero lines of code ... that&#x27;s insane. It turns your brain inside out. It changes the way you look at the web. You realize that, before, you didn&#x27;t do things right.<p>For those of you who don&#x27;t like to wait, here&#x27;s a demo [1].<p>It&#x27;s not a fake. It&#x27;s a full game. Details after the cut.<p>...<p>I&#x27;ve been programming for a long time. And it was for just that reason that I believed that I could manage a complex task like taking a game that was originally written using JS and re-writing it with zero lines of code.<p>Before this project I looked down on HTML programmers†. But now I realize that they&#x27;ll soon rule the world. You&#x27;ll remember how there was a time when JS programmers weren&#x27;t taken seriously. Do you remember those dark ages? But now take a look ... JavaScript is not just a trend. It&#x27;s everywhere. In the browser, on the server, running on microcontrollers and mobile OSes. You can write operating systems in it, and games. ... And now, HTML programming is quietly creeping up \non it.<p>One of these days writing zero lines of JS will be the norm. JS will fall out of fashion in the same way Flash did. Why write JavaScript if it&#x27;s slower than an HTML program written by an HTML programmer with the aid of CSS?<p>Repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/i0z/nojsgame\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/i0z/nojsgame</a><p>-----<p>† — The comment thread is dominated by responses to this one: &quot;&#x27;HTML programmer&#x27;—are you serious? :)&quot;<p>0. <a href=\"http://habrahabr.ru/post/202736/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://habrahabr.ru/post/202736/</a><p>1. <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/0dmin/9dQx3/embedded/result/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jsfiddle.net/0dmin/9dQx3/embedded/result/</a>",1385171660

6784872,comment,6783511,6783511,6,0,jgoodwin,,,"I think there is a mathematical theory here people should become acquainted with -- differential privacy.  So far it has found use in the context of a large data set, e.g. search engine query logs, to try to determine how invasive a statistical summary or release of only partly obfuscated data would be.<p>Like calculus, it has a sort of epsilon/delta construct -- given a differential privacy concern epsilon, under what circumstances (how tight a bound on delta) do I need to prevent that.<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy</a><p>Perhaps this theory could quantify the intuition that while it&#x27;s ok to snap my license plate now and then (very little differential privacy loss on my part), enough times and it becomes invasive, and dreadfully so.<p>This puts some teeth into the vague talk about a mosaic theory.  The key idea is whether the aggregate information in the data set can triangulate you, to within say 10000 persons (not much privacy invation), or 100 (quite a bit).  There seems to be a tipping point around clusters of 100-1000 persons or so, that is the typical size of small organizations or groups of people, such as churches and schools.<p>Now, as an application:  license plates are nearly unique identifiers and the attacker has a database of who&#x27;s who for all intents and purposes, so it is little different from asking everyone for their ID just because they are on the street.  That&#x27;s illegal by the way, even for the police.<p>The argument that was formerly deployed here is that using a vehicle on public roadways was a privilege that cost you natural expectation of privacy (non-intrusion) in public places.<p>The real crux of the issue here is that the public-private tradeoff was once predicated on the individual (the individual atom has protection, because data collection is sparse, so tagging the individual but not the path was meaningful).  Now the data collection is dense, and even single particle tracks become visible.<p>If you think in terms of fluid mechanics, there&#x27;s a sort of Euler view / Lagrange view here (as there is with tagged dollar particles and tagged wallets or accounts).<p>That is, tracking individuals and tracking their paths become duals of each other, if the data collection is dense enough.  It doesn&#x27;t matter whether the item tracked is the tagged individual, or the flows and transactions -- either way, complete reconstruction of the system becomes possible.<p>With any data set, there is a sort of &#x27;phase transition&#x27; in its size, where you suddenly can see the underlying trajectories of all the tagged particles.  Things that made perfect sense when data collection was sparse, just as allowing the police to jot down you license number and chase you with a bicycle, turn into totalitarian surveillance when the observations become dense enough -- in a way we can quantify in terms of a sudden jump in information gain that goes from nearly complete ignorance of where people are and what they are doing (the former phase), to near complete knowledge of everything.  Very much like percolation theory.",1385171498

6784867,comment,6782259,6784360,2,0,josephlord,,,"No need to insult people.<p>There can be more than one problem. In your area regulation may be a significant part of the problem but in other places (e.g. Europe) regulation can really help in places to enable competition.<p>Most economic &quot;laws&quot; apply in competitive markets with limited barriers to entry. It is hard to see how they apply even in an unregulated situation where infrastructure costs are so high and one market participant already has infrastructure in place.<p>Looking at an existing market with an incumbent trying to move in and challenge them is rarely a wise move whatever their current price. They are in a position to reduce prices and make your entry unviable, they know it and you know it so they can continue charging high monopoly rates until a challenger does announce themselves.<p>Government can do better (doesn&#x27;t mean they always will) because:<p>1) They can look at community benefits not just the ROI for the provider. In a way they win if the incumbent just reduces prices and improves service even if they actually lose some money they have invested in a competitor.<p>2) They can look long term.<p>3) They can set rules such as requiring the infrastructure owner to allow other providers to use their lines and regulate the pricing in that monopoly market (happens in the UK).

The concept is &quot;inevitable discovery&quot;.<p>The defense attorney can bring up claims that the evidence was ill-gotten, and if the claim is upheld, then the judge can throw out everything gained afterward, unless they can prove that it would have been discovered unrelated to the ill-gotten loot.<p>For example, if a police officer searches your home without a warrant and finds the murder weapon, that murder weapon ceases to exist, legally, and the suspect will likely get away scot free.<p>However, if a different officer pulls him over for a DUI a week later, not as a result of information provided by the unlawful search, and finds blood in the back seat of the car, which leads to an arrest, prosecution could claim that they would have obtained a warrant to his home that would then have likely surfaced the murder weapon.<p>Edit, all that was fairly random rambling, re-reading it in context, but what I meant to say was that I agree, and that his confession ought to be enough grounds to keep his termination permanent.",1385171272

No matter how careful you were to cover yourself and check each corner, you&#x27;d always cross a &#x27;tripwire&#x27; of some kind and a section of <i>wall</i> would open up - something you could never check - and it would always been behind you. It was the laziest attempt at horror I&#x27;ve seen. Once that became apparent, sneaking around was pointless. Just barrel forward, because it doesn&#x27;t matter what you do, there will always be an undetectable secret wall opening behind you.<p>Compare to Dead Space, where the things that came through walls did so at reasonable points - ventilation ducts or similar. You&#x27;d be on your guard around those spots, but a solid wall was never something with a &#x27;gotcha!&#x27; compartment.

The app store is a difficult beast these days... being free means you get a lot more downloads, but you need 100&#x27;s of thousands (if not millions) of users to make any decent amount of money. And you have to be very careful with your freemium plan. You don&#x27;t want to end up like <a href=\"http://www.penny-arcade.com/report/article/going-broke-with-success-how-an-app-with-200000-downloads-led-to-devel\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.penny-arcade.com/report/article/going-broke-with-...</a><p>If you&#x27;re a paid game, you&#x27;re going to have a very hard time getting sales, because you can&#x27;t acquire users. The 99 cent &#x27;race to the bottom&#x27; also means you need a lot of sales, but it&#x27;s tough to achieve that today without a brand or big-name. Even Apple featuring you doesn&#x27;t add up to as much as it used to.<p>So, you might have noticed a pattern amongst the more successful freemium titles. Lots of wait timers, short gameplay bursts, unlimited purchasables, etc... what hardcore gamers deem as evil, is actually what these companies have determined is the most optimal way to make money. I&#x27;m not trying to be depressing here lol, but before you make the decision to go free, make sure you understand what you&#x27;re up against. I personally hope we can head to a more League of Legends type model where you make $5 on a lot of people rather than the Farmville route of making $5000 on a few &#x27;whales&#x27;. I personally much prefer a great game that lets me pay when I&#x27;m ready to invest, than a game that is trying to milk me the whole time.<p>Just an FYI, me and a friend built Stratosphere: Multiplayer Defense for iPad and have gone through much of this dilemma lol.

Yes, &quot;everyone&quot; understands that 1 + 1 = 2 (most of the time, anyway), but that&#x27;s not all there is to mathematics. There are vast numbers of different branches of mathematics, often compatible but also often incompatible (in both notation and semantics). There is a fairly common core of mathematical syntax, but beyond that different branches will use their own syntax. Perhaps that&#x27;s like Lisps: the same fundamental meta-syntax but significantly different and often incompatible semantics and syntax on top of that.",1385169003

I personally thought our app was great, and had a decent shot at winning, but I went to bed assuming 99% odds we wouldn&#x27;t get picked. With that many entries the odds were not that great.<p>As lame as this sounds, I&#x27;ve learned the way to really win at Hackathons is to build something you wanted to build anyway. That way, if you win, it&#x27;s a nice bonus, but you&#x27;ll come out ahead no matter what.<p>The judging processes in these things is always suboptimal. I knew it was going to be a nightmare to try and narrow down that many entries to 5 in just a few hours. They were very optimistic in thinking they could pull that off. I think ChallengePost has a great opportunity to improve here by innovating so that if you enter a Hackathon, you get direct feedback from the judges (either quantitative numerical feedback or qualitative comments), so you get some acknowledgement for the hard work put in. The judging was indeed very light--as another data point I don&#x27;t think we got a single hit on our app-- but I thought they tried to do something unprecedented and did a decent enough job and can learn going forward.<p>It was a very cool event, I&#x27;m happy for the winners, and hopefully some of these Hackathon software tools like ChallengePost and HackerLeague can continue to get better and help alleviate some of these transparency concerns for future Hackathons.<p>I would definitely recommend participating in future Salesforce Hackathons.",1385168870

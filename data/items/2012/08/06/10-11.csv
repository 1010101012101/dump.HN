They just landed a rover on Mars; they have 2 satellites around Mars; they have satellites around Saturn, Mercury, and Vesta; they have spacecraft on their way to Jupiter and Pluto; they have a planet hunting space telescope which has discovered hundreds of extra-solar planets already; they have Hubble; they have an X-ray telescope; they have a gamma-ray telescope which just recently provided potential confirmation on the origin and nature of dark matter. Oh, and they have <i>another</i> operational rover on Mars. And this isn't even everything, nor does it touch manned spaceflight.<p>The ESA has been doing some pretty amazing work in the past few years (with Mars Express, Huygens, Rosetta, Planck/Herschel, XMM, Cluster, SOHO, and their cooperation on NASA missions and others) and Japan and others have been doing good work as well, but the budgetary commitment as a percentage of GDP is just not comparable. We shouldn't take NASA's successes and say ""oh, well, a bunch of other nations helped out some too, so, go world!"" We should give NASA their due, and we should give other space agencies their due as well, and we should challenge the world to support space science missions to the level they deserve.",1344249930

Their function is primarily to provide stereoscopic images for the rover's machine vision to analyze, enabling the rover to autonomously steer itself to a degree and halt if an unexpected hazard (for instance, a large boulder) comes up during movement.<p>The HazCams also had clear lens covers in place to protect the lenses from all the dust blown around by the landing rockets. These were not yet removed in the very first images -- indeed, the reason they're clear is that even if for some reason a cover gets stuck, a dusty image is better than no image at all.<p>Moreover, as the first communications opportunity was rather short, and the high-bandwidth directional antenna is not yet unfolded, there was simply no bandwidth available to downlink very high-resolution images.<p>The mast of the rover, containing the high-resolution NavCams and MastCams, is still folded up. If all goes well, it will be raised in a couple of days and higher-res images beamed up in due course.<p>Here's a nice article on Curiosity's various cameras: <a href=""http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2012-226"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2012-226</a>",1344248776

That's the point I want to make (apart from the you-are-never-too-late point others have made already): at 18, your learning skills are so much better that you'll catch up quite well.<p>The above is the general case, I think, for learning to code. If you're good at chess, sports, whatever, and you're lucky, you'll get help that works as an 'external learning curve velocity enhancer'. The same thing would account for young programmers with proper guidance, but the matter of fact is: most of us didn't have that (I even didn't have internet, I had to get books from the library and cherished a floppy disk containing a plethora of technical game programming articles).<p>I also see this in a different field I'm active in, as a volunteer at the local life saving / swimming club. Those that start at 6 take like 8-10 years to learn most of the material. Those that come in at 16 or 18 can catch up in a year or two, whilst well motivated.",1344247667

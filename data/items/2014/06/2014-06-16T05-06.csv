The base Obj-C that we started with was pretty simple and reasonably elegant, but over the years we&#x27;ve been grafted pieces onto it in decidedly inelegant ways.<p>Block syntax, a ludicrous proliferation of __keywords and @keywords, the verbosity of GCD calls, all of it makes modern, complex Obj-C apps harder and harder to write.<p>In a lot of ways Swift is a reset. It offers a lot of the things we want from Obj-C/Cocoa (e.g., more block-based everything) in a clean syntax that was designed from the get-go to support it.<p>One of the complex bits of Swift right now is that the APIs haven&#x27;t been ported. UIButton still expects targets and selectors (ugh), and an innumerable number of API calls still rely on the only C-style way of passing error pointers into calls to see if they get filled (and necessitating the idiotic NSErrorPointer class). A lot of the complexity of building in Swift right now is shoehorning Obj-C style APIs into Swift code.",1402896770

Quoting [1], here&#x27;s what a &#x27;steam reformer&#x27; does:<p><pre><code>  At high temperatures (700 – 1100 °C) and in the presence\n  of a metal-based catalyst (nickel), steam reacts with \n  methane to yield carbon monoxide and hydrogen. These two \n  reactions are reversible in nature.\n\n    CH4 + H2O ⇌ CO + 3 H2\n</code></pre>\nSo there it is, the &#x27;hydrogen-rich gas&#x27; is syngas [3], one mole carbon monoxide plus 3 moles hydrogen.<p>The syngas can either be burned directly (producing CO2 and heat of course), or continuing per [1], separated from the H2, then combined with more water:<p><pre><code>  Additional hydrogen can be recovered by a lower-\n  temperature gas-shift reaction with the carbon monoxide \n  produced. The reaction is summarized by:\n\n    CO + H2O ⇌ CO2 + H2\n</code></pre>\nBut the article uses just one word, &#x27;afterburner&#x27; which tells me they&#x27;re burning away the carbon monoxide:<p><pre><code>  The researchers were particularly responsible for the \n  construction of the prototype, the design of the overall \n  system, the design of the ceramic components and the \n  development of the reformer and the afterburner.\n</code></pre>\nNot clear is whether the CO goes /through/ the ceramic SOFC or is separated so it can /bypass/ the SOFC then get remixed with some H2 at the &#x27;afterburner&#x27;.  No mention of a &#x27;separator&#x27;, so perhaps the CO does go straight through the SOFC along with the H2 without ruining the SOFC.<p>In any case, we see this CHP plant with its SOFC requires water in, makes carbon monoxide in the process, which it &#x27;afterburn[s]&#x27;, certainly putting out CO2 [the Carbon from the methane can&#x27;t just disappear, would you have that as carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide?], and needs some heat to run the steam reformer.  There goes some of your thermal efficiency!<p>[2] has a bit more on home CHP.<p>So long story short, there&#x27;s no free lunch here:<p>* It can&#x27;t hit 100% thermal efficiency<p>* It releases CO2<p>* Its intermediate stage passes H2 through, and CO either through or around the SOFC, then burns off the CO to CO2<p>* It needs water as well as natural gas to work<p>Presuming the Bloom Boxes also use SOFCs and methane, the operating chemistry would be the similar at the inputs and outputs: Natural Gas and Water in; Heat, CO2 and Electricity out.<p>There may be an advance in materials science if the SOFC accepts syngas ( CO + 3 H2 ) directly without bypass of the CO and without cell degradation from the CO, but the press release says nothing specific about, or suggestive of that.<p>edits for dialog form, clarity, corrections, &#x27;afterburner&#x27; clean up the  CO in the syngas to CO2, no water out, oh it says press release right at the top, no wonder it reads like one<p>========<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_reforming"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_reforming</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_fuel_cell"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_fuel_cell</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syngas"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syngas</a>",1402896747

Hydrocolloids aren&#x27;t very expensive, let you do cool stuff, and often take very little time/effort to use. Toss an eight of a teaspoon of xanthan in your next salad dressing and watch it get creamy as all hell and not separate.<p>Beyond that, there&#x27;s a lot of info in there about classical cooking too that is quite informative. You&#x27;ll improve the performance of your charcoal grill by lining it with foil, for instance. It&#x27;s neat seeing how proper wok cooking works, even though you can&#x27;t try it at home because you&#x27;ll never get a hot enough burner.",1402895278

This phrase is intended for people without crypto knowledge who would not know what a one-way hash is. The &quot;using a one-way hash&quot; phrase is intended for people who do have this knowledge and clarifies that they are actually using a hash function, and that the previous statement was just a simplification for lay people.",1402895260

My news feed is maybe 5 real posts, 10 &quot;upworthy&quot; style video shares, top10 lists and &quot;brand&quot; content. The whole thing feels useless, and all the things I actually care about are buried under ads and crapware. Events and messaging are the main usable portions of the platform - I only know a few people who use those exclusively, and once they&#x27;re off I&#x27;m done with facebook entirely.",1402895215

I do think you&#x27;ve missed a couple of reasons some people object so strongly to airbnb though.  This service has the capacity to transform residential places with families into transient or tourist destinations.  Even if the airbnb guests revolving in the spare bedrooms in the house next to mine are quiet and pleasant they aren&#x27;t going to be a family with kids that my kids will get to know over the next decade of life.<p>I really don&#x27;t object to airbnb&#x27; s existence. But I do think people in some neighborhoods should be able to trade their right to run a hotel out of their house in exchange for a legally enforced expectation that their neighbors won&#x27;t either.  This is critical for certain types of neighborhoods and is encoded in zoning laws.",1402895159

You can generate a large amount of energy on bright, sunny days but what happens at night when people go home and turn on their lights, television, and computers?  Without a way to offer on-demand energy, solar will never be able to replace traditional coal and gas-fired plants.  Wind power does fare better throughout the day, but is still subject to the whims of the weather.  The big piece of the puzzle still to be solved is large scale battery/storage technology.",1402894800

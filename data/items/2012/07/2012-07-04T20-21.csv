Fortunately, building a robot that can write human readable text from structured data, is many order of magnitudes easier than building robots that does the opposite. Pattern recognition is what's keeping current chat bots so dumb. But we actually already have some really good bots that write text reports. You probably already read news/sports reports written by bots and never noticed.<p>I believe that's the way for future tools. Users give very basic structured data (who's the protagonist, what does he do, did he die at the end?). And robots transform that data into text, movie scripts or whatever.<p>> Even designing a tool allowing a person without experience to come up with camera angles and sequences<p>You don't need to do that. Bloggers don't need to understand HTML nor CSS. A good tool would give higher layers of abstractions to choose, which were designed internally by professionals. And the user shouldn't even need to know what good angles or lighting is.",1341435583

The price of a bitcoin at the time I am writing this is 6.54 USD, so the total revenue is 47,088 USD per day.<p>That mean, assuming a miner can win all blocks at 50 bitcoin forever assuming the price and difficulty stay the same, he can afford to pay an electric bill of 47,088 per day assuming that the price hold stable. This equals to 17,187,120 USD in revenue every year.<p>The market cap of bitcoin is only 60,951,475 USD, which mean miner revenue equals 28% of the market cap. However, most economic activities are certainly not miners, but actually trading bots and speculators across exchanges. In the MtGox USD alone, about 8.7 million dollars worth of bitcoin were exchanged in 30 days. You can also add in the various economic activities other than trading currencies, such as virtual goods, hosting, ice creams, t-shirts, porn, illegal drugs, etc.<p>You can conclude that the miners are guaranteeing more than just revenues for themselves, as the various activities in the bitcoin economy which actually probably dwarf what the miners are making in term of revenues. As far as being actually efficient method of security for a currency? Probably not right now, assuming that security measures actually scale economically. It could be that the actual electricity cost grows slower as more and more efficient method of hashing are found.",1341434887

Most countries do have that paragraph in their legislation stating patents need to be non-obvious to someone of similar skill. But you almost never see that being tested in court, because how the hell do you prove it?<p>One of the big problems with the patent system is that it tries to implement solutions that are not viable in practice. There's no good, plain, clear, and <i>unbiased</i> way to prove a patent is indeed trivial. Even if we us hackers look at each other and agree that it's trivial.<p>I'd love to live in a world where innovators of non trivial solutions were rewarded money from others, without punishing these other innovators. But that's not possible to implement in practice!",1341432125

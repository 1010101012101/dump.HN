3179784,comment,3179601,3179601,1,0,exicer,,,"I had a very bad experience with maths when I was younger, generally doing very badly and as such taking the sensible option of hating it. I even dropped my study of maths at A level, in spite of my huge love of Physics and desire to study it at University.<p>I was eventually convinced that I really should take maths, so after a year out I did. I personally found the difference in the topics being studied to be drastic. No longer tedious mental arithmetic and boring calculation, but far more interesting things like calculus and mechanics! I suddenly found that things made sense, which had rarely been the case before. Perhaps you have a similar issue, and find calculation difficult?<p>I, like you, find that I make very many ""silly"" mistakes. This is something that continues to plague me. I have developed techniques to compensate for these weaknesses, so while it might take me longer to go through the ""grunt work"" of solving a problem, I can quite happily end up with the right result. I suppose my point is, while it is not an advantage, it doesn't have to be too great of a disadvantage!<p>I have also been diagnosed as dyslexic, though I don't really know how true that is. Perhaps this is something you might look in to.",1320105525

3179758,comment,3177615,3179544,2,0,tikhonj,,,"Several things jump out immediately:<p><pre><code>  - Haskell has exceptionally thorough type inference (almost all type declarations are optional).
  - anything impure (e.g. involving an I/O) is typed as such
  - the types are easier to read and tend to give a good idea of what the function in question is doing
  - much more complicated types are readable
  - idioms like Monads lead to a lot of code that is much more abstract and generic than anything I've seen in Java. There are tons of library functions that can work on lists, or IO things, or parsers, or random values...
</code></pre>
Some things that I found particularly cool in Haskell:
  - functions (and even constants!) can be polymorphic on their return type. The function read, for example, always takes in a String but returns whatever type you happen to need.
  - You can easily express things like a ""list of list"": [[a]]. I don't even know how to begin writing a function like join in Java. (On lists, join takes a list of lists of something and flattens it.)<p>Overall, I've found Haskell's type system to be much more useful, and much less of a burden, than Java's.<p>That said, I'm just a college student with limited experience with either language. I've used Java more than Haskell but I've been using the latter more recently; I've never used C#.",1320105127

""It gets better"" wasn't started to try to claim that the situation for LBGT teenagers was improving (although that's true), because that message doesn't really help the individual teen.  The message was: as you, individually, get older, it will get better.  And, more specifically, please don't kill yourself because your life is difficult right now.  A similar idea appears in some of PG's essays where he points out that high school is pretty unpleasant for nerds, but most of that disappears later in life.

It doesn't matter that he's a stereotypical ""weird kid"" as Dave Winer describes him. We're all hackers here and before the days of the Brogrammer, most of us were (and still are) weird kids. What does matter is the message Stallman conveys in his talks. It's an important one, and he brings it across very eloquently.<p>He himself is, however, an extremist and people do well to always keep this in mind. He is still influential because he is an extremist with a lot of legitimate grievances. When he is giving talks he sounds reasonable, because the fundamentals of his ideas are reasonable. That doesn't mean he is a reasonable person. In many interactions he does in fact appear to be the bully, not the victim.<p>In the end, RMS is so fanatical about his vision of Free Software that he as a person becomes remarkably non-free. That's a tremendous price to pay and I respect that. So there is no need to come down for or against RMS. He is what he is - he does his thing irregardless of the world around him.<p>I believe it's not always productive to try and pass a final judgement on people or ideas, to try and weigh the good vs the bad and arrive at a net value. It is not necessary to stand up for or against Stallman.

I migrated most of my video and photo work to the PC just because the speed was much faster having the drives local. It seems strange to me that I have to have two computers to do basic things. I greatly prefer the Unix on the Apple, but it's getting to where I might just switch back to the PC since the Mac has become an impediment to my workflow. This after using Macs since the 1980s for work at home. It makes no sense. Why shouldn't all Macs have easy access to reasonable amounts of storage. They should. Not having a reasonable solution here is really boneheaded of Apple.",1320104519

It's been like this since elementary school. This doesn't seem to bode well for acceptance to a high-quality computer science program.<p>I don't believe this hurts my ability to program. My abstract reasoning skills tend to be exceptionally sharp; I enjoy and succeed (A to A- level) in AP Chemistry and take an honors english course.

3179562,comment,3179505,3179505,41,0,untog,,,"Reminds me of one of the more confusing bugs I've ever encountered in my life. I was throwing together a quick UI with Adobe Flex, and for some reason every time you clicked a particular button, the entire UI would shift 20 or so pixels to the right. I spent hours scratching my head until I noticed this for loop:<p><pre><code>    for (x=0;x<variable.length;x++) {
    // blah
    }
</code></pre>
I wasn't declaring the x variable, so it was using the x part of the x/y positioning of the UI container. Woops.<p>edit: initialise/declare brain freeze",1320102221

3179559,comment,3179329,3179329,2,0,droithomme,,,"The problem is really simple. Lots of people, myself included, need a computer with accessible drives to be replaced, and it would be really nice to have a PCI bus. Apple offers this, but only at an outrageous cost that includes 6, 8 or 12 processors, which we don't need, and also the PCI-e bus has extremely few normal cards available, because Apple sells so few Pros, because they are massively overpriced. The alternatives are iMac, MacBook and MacMini, none of which have the current industry standard USB3 ports, all of which instead have a weird nonstandard Thunderbolt connector that requires $50 intelligent cables and for which no virtually no peripherals are available now, or ever will be available, except at extravagant cost.<p>It's a serious problem that affects my work, and the work of many, all due to mismanagement of their computer line by Apple.<p>I have around 4TB of files I regularly access, including  video archives of tutorial and marketing films.<p>On a Mac Pro, I can drop 2x2TB drives in and be ready to go, and even have a couple more for mirroring, but the price of the chassis to hold the drives (the Pro) is outlandish.<p>With the iMac, you can't upgrade to that capacity at all, and even upgrading the internal drive to 2TB is trouble because Apple puts custom chips on their drives that prevent the temperature sensor from reporting right so that for many people upgrading the drive makes the fans run at full speed. Putting the drives into Firewire enclosures means I have to buy rare and expensive FW800 external housings, daisy chain them, and have multiple wall warts, transformers, enclosures and wires all over the place, just like back in the Commodore 64 days, and if something gets snagged on one of these cables mid drive write, the whole system becomes hosed.<p>For a platform historically known for suitability for multimedia work which has always required fair amounts of storage, the situation is abominable.",1320102193

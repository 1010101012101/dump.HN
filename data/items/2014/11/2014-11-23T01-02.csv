you should pick something better. In attempts to appeal to non-technical

confused them.<p>I realize the phrase comes from your main dropfrog.io site with your

8647495,comment,8645571,8647391,0,0,ctchocula,,,"> Flash doesn&#x27;t just have a set list, he uses his general intelligence exhaustively during games<p>I am not so familiar with SC2, but I know a bit about BW. I think you are mystifying Flash a bit here. I went through a BW phase (because my friends were all interested in it). I was trying to learn a build, so I watched Youtube videos of Flash games where he goes siege expand vs. Protoss. When the camera shows Flash&#x27;s scout exploring the enemy base, you can see what information Flash gains, which is a (possibly incomplete) count on a number of units and buildings. Then by Flash&#x27;s actions and deviations from his usual build order, one can construct an if-else statement of his reaction (defined as deviation from his standard build).<p>For example, one detail I noted was that he usually builds an Engineering Bay on 33 supply, but one game he starts it immediately at 21 supply after his scouting SCV was blocked by zealots from entering the Protoss base and seeing no Nexus up at the natural. The reason he did this was because he was afraid of 1-base DT rush. This gives us one thing that Flash looks for when he scouts in one particular build vs. Protoss. Since Flash is but human, I believe his thought process can be reduced to a checklist. It&#x27;s not a very romantic notion of the best BW player of all time, but given enough data I believe it can be done. Perhaps by a bot that collects all the data from Youtube videos of pro BW games. I was thinking of writing a bot that does that, but what with the declining interest in BW and having to learn new tools never got around to it. Or even better, a former pro player could be asked.<p>There are fakes in BW too where a player begins construction of a building while the scout is there, but cancels as soon as the scout is out of sight. This would be included as part of the data, which a clever enough parser would be able to make sense of.<p>> and he still loses a lot from being too predictable, too routine, producing the same responses to the same stimuli - even though his macro mechanics and builds are utterly top-notch.<p>I think at least part of this may be attributed to the difference in mechanical floor needed to play the game at the top level. In BW, the number of players who could keep up with Flash&#x27;s late-game macro were a mere handful. He had a reputation that even if you knew what he was going to do, you still couldn&#x27;t beat him. In SC2 however, the reward of predictable play going to late-game may be less apparent.<p>> For me, the mechanical things are a zen thing. It&#x27;s almost like a sort of meditation; your mind falls into these practiced routines, but you have to juggle all of them at the same time, choose which ones you can afford to let fall (since you can&#x27;t do everything at once,) and then have your higher order tactical and strategical decisions on top of it. I haven&#x27;t ever done anything else which engages my mind in the same way, and it certainly wouldn&#x27;t do so without the mechanical demand you can never truly fulfill.<p>This part is quite fascinating to me, because I recently had a similar experience playing Osu!, which is like fast-paced DDR but with mouse and keyboard. At first I was just clicking slowly, but after several hours, I felt my body taking over and almost playing the game by instinct beating maps that were way too fast for me to beat a few days before. Before such an experience, I&#x27;d dismissed people who play Osu! as wasting their time doing something pointless and the music as a great destroyer of conscious thought. Yet after getting into a relaxing &quot;Zen&quot; state similar to the one you mentioned, I felt I could still think very clearly about my day, which came as a pleasant surprise.",1416707098

8647456,comment,8645660,8646561,0,0,tokenadult,,,"I have to strenuously disagree with you (respectfully, of course) on this issue, dang. My several years of participation in the University of Minnesota journal club on behavior genetics, in which we go over current papers, sometimes being amazed by the papers (especially the papers on the methodology of doing science right) and sometimes picking apart the papers line by line (especially the papers on social psychology), have taught me to the core that most scientists are doing a job narrowly conceived of as trying to get published. I think they mostly went into science because they also desire to seek truth and inform humanity, but institutional pressures sometimes keep them from achieving that ideal. A surprisingly huge percentage of working scientists, as John P.A. Ioannidis[1], Uri Simonsohn,[2] Peter Norvig,[3] and special issues of science journals[4] and methodological blogs[5] remind us, are actually working right at their own level of competence or even beyond their own level of competence in setting up experiments and observational studies to be validly generalizable. I do NOT assume that &quot;that the people doing the work are idiots,&quot; but I do assume, based on huge numbers of historical and current events examples, that the people doing the work are fallible and subject to cognitive biases (as I am) and subject pressure to publish to stay funded. Moreover, announcements of results are subject to wishful thinking on the part of a university press office.<p>Until a preliminary study has been replicated, I don&#x27;t take it to be a statement of facts about the world. Even Wikipedia, which accepts some very dodgy user-submitted content, declares a content guideline that Wikipedia articles should be based on SECONDARY sources[6] (that is, sources by authors who have thought about and digested the primary research findings) rather by preliminary primary research findings. (Of course, for lack of enforcement, many Wikipedia articles break this rule.) It&#x27;s especially important to establish high standards of sourcing for statements about human health and medicine and nutrition.[7]<p>I genuinely think that many (too many) readers of Hacker News have no idea what an adequate sample size would be, for a given effect size, to validly infer from a preliminary study result a statement about the entire population. We should be talking about sample sizes all the time here (I agree, with more sophistication and nuance than we often do) as part of educating ourselves about basic science methodology in this community of intellectual discussion.<p>That said, I heartily agree that &quot;Betteridge&#x27;s Law&quot; is a useless Internet meme, even though it was popularized here by our esteemed site founder pg. We can do better, and we can raise the level of discussion here. I cherish the participants here who can speak knowledgeably about experiment design, about effect sizes, about observational studies as contrasted with experimental studies, and so on. I also delight when participants here share links to the prior scholarly literature, and especially when something is submitted here that is a better source than a press release.[8] Besides decrying crap, I like to applaud thoughtful discussion, so I regularly upvote comments that point us beyond the headlines to what issues researchers have to grapple with as they try to figure out the complexity of the world.<p>[1] <a href=""https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/john-ioannidis?tab=publications"" rel=""nofollow"">https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/john-ioannidis?tab=publica...</a><p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~uws/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~uws/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/6/528.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/6/528.full</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://retractionwatch.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://retractionwatch.com/</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable...</a><p>[7] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable...</a>

A full installation is about 2.5 GB including source code (which is about 900 MB for the FreeBSD sources plus about another 800 MB for the Ports tree).  Installation is extremely simple.  Third-party software is cleanly separated from the base system.  If you&#x27;re coming from Linux, FreeBSD now has great binary package management tools in the form of pkgng, which is every bit as good and easy to use as APT or yum.  I love the FreeBSD documentation.  There are useful manual pages even for kernel internals and device drivers.  I think that PF is vastly easier to understand and configure than iptables; the same goes for FreeBSD&#x27;s IPsec implementation.  Everything&#x27;s laid out in a very logical, consistent manner, with lots of comments in config files and whatnot.<p>What&#x27;s kept me on FreeBSD is the Ports tree (the third-party package build infrastructure).  I love how easily I can build customized packages for my computers, especially now with pkgng and tools like poudriere (refer to this great tutorial at <a href=""http://www.bsdnow.tv/tutorials/poudriere"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bsdnow.tv/tutorials/poudriere</a>).  I can very easily set up my own custom package repository that either supplements or wholly replaces FreeBSD&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve tried to do similar things with Linux, but it definitely isn&#x27;t as easy.  The ports tree committers are very responsive, and creating (and submitting!) one&#x27;s own packages is both well documented and very easy.<p>I like how much of the system configuration is done in /etc/rc.conf.  I like how the various system and ports tree build-time knobs are all in /etc/make.conf.  I like how daily maintenance scripts/health checks both run by default and are all configured in /etc/periodic.conf.  I like how understandable the base system is, kernel internals included.  I&#x27;m no expert developer (and believe me, there&#x27;s plenty of advanced Unix hacker wizardry in the FreeBSD sources), but things are accessible enough to even one such as me that I successfully modified the ciss driver this year to work around a weird bug in some old server gear I was experimenting with.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong - I love me some Unix, but modern Linux distributions seem over-complicated in a lot of the ways I don&#x27;t like about Solaris or AIX or Windows, even though there&#x27;s a lot of nice stuff from the perspective of an end user.  If you install Ubuntu or Fedora, a lot of stuff Just Works(tm), and that&#x27;s great!  I love Ubuntu and Fedora!

Instead, they would ask &quot;what&#x27;s a &#x27;qustate&#x27;?&quot;, and someone would say &quot;well, it&#x27;s sort of like a classical state...but it&#x27;s not the same...and it&#x27;s sorta like an epistemic probability distribution...but also not really...and the difference are subtle and very profound and you have to be careful and it takes a good amount of studying before you can understand.&quot;  And that would be great and maybe a few more people would go actually read about it.  But as it stands physicists are more than happy to allow laymen to misinterpret their terminology when it leads to their work sounding more exciting and getting more funding.  There is definitely something of a Motte-and-Bailey going on.

So, has something changed?<p>Actually, the mere agreement of Alice and Bob&#x27;s measurement doesn&#x27;t really give evidence that anything on Bob&#x27;s side has changed.  If I jumble a blue marble and a red marble in an urn and then put them in separate brown bags and give you one at random, then when you look in your bag that will instantly determine what I&#x27;ll get when I look in mine, but it didn&#x27;t change anything about my bag in the normal, physical sense.<p>The way in which quantum mechanics differs from this situation is subtle but significant.",1416705826

So it can&#x27;t be that hard.",1416704486

Assuming one cycle per day (solar charge during day+discharge during night) in 50 years there are 18000 cycles.<p>The figure of merit for Li-ion is 250x1000=2.5e5. My estimate (and those of others) is that this costs up to about $2000/KWh. So the figure of merit for this is 1000x18000=0.9e7. Two orders of magnitude better than Li-ion.<p>Edit: I am ignoring the cost of capital, interest rates etc. Somebody should do this analysis.",1416704451

I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s more or less frequent depending on which ports you favor and how far you drift from release. (And it goes without saying: open source, send patches, etc.)<p>To be fair, I&#x27;ve found fewer excuses to not stay current on the OS since freebsd-update. cvsup and building your own source worked fine, but it was a little tedious.<p>pkg has done the same for the ports tree. If you just need the tool on the box now, pkg install bash. If you care about how the tool is configured, cd /usr/ports/mail/postfix; make config-recursive && make install clean. It all just works, works well, and works well together.<p>There have been some threads on HN lately about the frustration of changing the UI for the sake of changing the UI. FreeBSD rarely surprises me. When it does, the documentation usually sets me straight. (Or a few minutes browsing <<a href=""https://docs.freebsd.org/mail/>."" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.freebsd.org/mail/>.</a>)<p>I lived through a lot of This vs. That flame wars and I&#x27;ve learned to roll with whatever the choice is. At the end of the day, they&#x27;re all just tools I use to do my job; I use whatever tools are in vogue. But as a professional user of tools, FreeBSD is a very well designed tool and I wish I got to use it more. It makes my job easy.",1416704418

Additionally, right now, his homepage states he is on a break. So, at the end of the day, where would the author rather be? Would he rather send his kids somewhere else? I doubt it, but internally he may have a streak of contempt while living and working in this environment.<p>I visited Stanford for a few hours while travelling through California and even the bookshop clerk pretended I was some sort of king. Maybe she took acting classes, or denies the fact were she not employed by Stanford, many of the students wouldn't give her much more than the time of day.<p>I have nothing against Standford or the people that attend, and the article rang true with my experience passing through the school and my experience with people in that 'sphere' of influence. I don't associate myself with any sphere, and I aim to look at everyone's humanity. Furthermore, I went to a top univeristy (in Australia), but was one of the 'searchers,' so perhaps you can go to an Ivy league school but obtain the benefits on your own terms. When I got to university, I realized that not only had I not 'arrived,' but that I had barely even started. It really depends how deep you want your journey to go.<p>Says the article: ""There’s no point in excluding people unless they know they’ve been excluded.""<p>Social exclusion as practiced by the 'elites' (or anyone with any modicum of power) has its usefulness - it's a way to get ahead and stay ahead with that power. As such, people that are excluded shouldn't take it personally when they realize that the person or people who are excluding them overtly or covertly have designated them as their worst enemy, biggest rival, and their greatest fear. Ironically, for those not truly confronting their fears, the greatest power is deflected.",1214247352

But you beat me to it.<p>So, I'll add that admissions are usually nicer to in-state students (the UT system in Texas is extremely generous about who they admit from state high school graduates, for example, and cheap to attend for Texans).  Since the OP has revealed he's in California, he's even better placed, though I think state schools are significantly more expensive in CA (but what isn't?), but the quality of education available at some state schools is excellent.<p>UC Davis and Berkeley are both very well-regarded in comp sci (as are many others).

225413,comment,225299,225398,0,0,apu,,,"While I heartily agree that K&R is the best way to learn C, I'd strongly recommend <i>against</i> learning C en route to C++. Most ""best practices"" in C are usually frowned upon (or worse) in C++. For example, using c-style arrays (instead of Vectors), using pointers excessively (instead of references), malloc/free (instead of new/delete), lots of global functions/variables (instead of classes, etc).<p>As far as picking between the two, it depends on your goals. If you really just want to learn about low-level programming, then C is probably the best option. On the other hand, if you want to be able to write low-level code for speed (i.e., to then call it from a high-level language), you might be better off with C++ (which is much more flexible while maintaining most of C's speed). Keep in mind, however, that using C++ effectively can get significantly more complicated than C (templates, classes, etc.), and so it is not usually a good idea to learn it ""for learning's sake.""",1214246805

8965,comment,8956,8956,0,0,npk,,,"The power of the internet today is the social component.  It seems silly to spend resources reinventing the wheel.  Does it make sense to use Facebook's developer toolkit?<p>1) Should you worry that you're relying on the infrastructure of another company?  Will VCs worry about your long term prospects?<p>2) Would it be ok to use the developer toolkit until your business is a success, and then switch to your own code?",1175729335

8962,comment,8741,8741,0,0,teki321,,,"I think the RSS is just a beginning. Google Reader is like a custom webpage with all the information what I am interested in.<p>The only thing what I miss is the commenting, I don't want to visit the website just to read and write comments.<p>Some ideas in this field:
- in each rss entry there should be a link to the RSS of the comments. 
- RSS readers should display them inline.
- xml-rpc for blog commenting: <a href=""http://www.webpronews.com/blogtalk/2007/02/20/xml-rpc-for-blog-comments"">http://www.webpronews.com/blogtalk/2007/02/20/xml-rpc-for-blog-comments</a>
- each comment should contain the possibility to write a reply (with the help of xml-rpc + a small form)
- or the whole thing can be implemented on an email or IM base<p>",1175729092

8960,comment,8863,8949,0,0,zach,,,"I love that approach (my weblog is called ""Story-Driven"" after all) because it automatically breaks technical people out of a taxonomic, procedural mindset.  So many descriptions of things are on the order of ""well, it's a set of pliers with a light on it"" instead of ""it's how I change fuses in my rusty fusebox in the middle of the night.""<p>You can't emphasize enough to people to tell a story, and the screencast is a great crucible for whether you have a good story to tell.  Screencasts aren't appreciated enough for the way they've helped people understand concepts that are a little more technical than they normally would sit still for.",1175728667

This is not an easy problem, if you aren't prepared for it in advance. If 10,000 users sign up tomorrow... you might be very very hosed, as opposed to very very happy.",1175727738

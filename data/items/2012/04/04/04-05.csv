Sometimes people have something real, but it's instinctive and they haven't yet sharpened or polished it. Under such conditions it's good to evoke it out of them rather than challenging them on lack of specificity.<p>That may not apply as much to an investor-founder conversation, because a founder should perhaps be expected to say what they mean unambiguously. But in normal conversation, I think it applies a lot.<p>Even in the founder situation, there are genuinely talented people who lack full articulacy as of yet.

Polysyllabic words seem relatively stable, except for some oddities where you can take poetic license, like putting the accent on the last syllable of ""cursed"" (""cursd"").<p>For an example of where it seems weird w/ monosyllabic words, compare, ""I WENT to the STORE to BUY some BREAD"", which has a sort of poetic rhythm, with ""I went TO the STORE to BUY some BREAD"" which seems weird, even in a poem. An offhand analysis is that stressing the main verb and then running ""to the"" together into one unstressed syllable is more natural than making the main verb unstressed and stressing the preposition. Perhaps buried in the code of some text-to-speech engine are heuristics that cover some of these cases? But perhaps they can just be ignored at first, and patched up later in cases where results are too strange.<p>Anyway, this is just miscellaneous thoughts about future enhancements; the current Nantucket is cool to try out.",1333515280

3796222,comment,3792486,3796103,1,0,celer,,,"I think that there is very strong evidence that this has been happening for a significant period of time. When I look at the length of time children are expected to be in school, I see a trend of a long rise spiking recently. If a large part of the importance of schooling is job training, that is strong evidence for a decline in low skilled jobs.<p>To look at a model for what is causing this, I point to automation. Scivener is an archaic term today because the job is no longer needed. A Roomba helps replace a maid. The United States manufactures more today than ever before, using fewer jobs. The last log table I saw was printed in 1906. Google Earth is more accurate than most, if not all, surveyors. All because we have technology to do our jobs for us.<p>On the other side, assembly line manufacturing did produce an increase in low skill jobs, Amazon's Mechanical Turk suffers no lack of customers, and some modern day sweatshops engage in gold farming and CAPTCHA breaking. I argue that new technology tends to remove more low skilled jobs than it creates, and that the pace of new technology increases over time. Is this a claim you would disagree with?<p>The starving masses is what I think many people will see themselves as. The lack of truth to this claim is barely relevant, and inequality has always been able to produce anger.",1333515013
3796221,comment,3795064,3795064,19,0,carterac,,,"The top comment is a very interesting counterpoint to Isaacson's post:<p>Jonathan Rotenberg 1 week ago<p>Isaacson has a lot of good facts, but misses HOW Steve led, HOW he made decisions, and HOW he created the products and companies he did. Steve spent his entire life trying to teach a very different approach to business leadership. Most people (including Isaacson) weren't able to listen during Steve's life, because they were so stuck in their own preconceived ideas.<p>I knew Steve closely for more than 30 years.  He introduced me to meditation and Buddhism when I was 18 and he was 26.  Steve struggled mightily to try to get Westerners to wake up from their half-alseep, wrong ideas about how business works.<p>The essence of Steve's approach to leadership are contained in the two-word tagline with which he relaunched Apple in 1997: THINK DIFFERENT. Isaacson projects a lot of his own misconceptions onto what Steve meant by ""Think Different.""  Isaacson mistakenly attributes delusional 'magical' thinking, perfectionism, reality distortion, and artistic exuberance to how Steve did what he did.Steve was a deeply dedicated, disciplined Buddhist practitioner. He followed an Eastern wisdom tradition that is antithetical to many Western theoretical models about business leadership. Buddhism sees competition, free markets, asset-management theories, and much of what is inculcated at Harvard Business School not as first-principles to reify, but as relatively minor, man-made artifacts.The source of all wisdom in Eastern traditionsand what Steve meant in the words ""Think Different""is MINDFULNESS. Mindfulness means paying attention to your present-moment experience as it is received through your sense doors. Where HBS would have business managers pack their present-moment experiences with theoretical frameworks and opinions, ""Think Different"" means: Drop ALL your theories, concepts & preconceived ideas. PAY ATTENTION instead to the raw reality coming in through your five senses and your mind. This is where you will find real insight and wisdom.In trying to understand how Steve Jobs succeeded as a CEO, Isaacson is like someone who has never played basketball observing what he see as the elements of Michael Jordan's success. Michael Jordan sweats, makes serious expressions on his face, leans as he passes the basketball, etc. This is an outside observer's view who doesn't see things from Michael Jordan's vantage point or and doesn't gets what is going on in Michael's mind.In fairness to Isaacson, he would probably have had to spend several years investigating his own preconceived ideas before he could truly listen clearly & receptively to Steve Jobs. Isaacson did a yeoman job of capturing Steve's life story under very stressful, difficult circumstances. Isaacson has given humanity a tremendous gift in all of his good work.As far the ""Real Leadership Lessons of Steve Jobs,"" however, I don't think Isaacson is even close. One could test whether or not Isaacson's insights work with an empirical experiment. Take two similar portfolios of ten companies. Ask the senior leadership of the first ten companies to read Isaacson's article and follow its advice carefully. Ask the senior leadership of the second NOT to read Isaacson's article. Wait a year and see: Did Isaacson's article make a difference in the performance and effectiveness of the first group? I don't think it would, but I could be wrong. I believe the Real Leadership Lessons of Steve Jobs are still to be written. The true leadership lessons of Steve Jobs are the lessons born of the first high-profile business leader to build a global company from a deep foundational grounding in BOTH Western Capitalism and in Eastern Wisdom traditions. In other words, Steve Jobs was the first Boddhisatva Warrior in history to become a Fortune 500 CEO.<p>Jonathan Rotenberg\nFounder, The Boston Computer Society",1333515000

That's all I'm saying.<p>Let me answer some of your points more specifically:\nNUMA is a concern, but with some work on the schedular to give goroutines <i>slight</i> affinity for threads, this can be largely mitigated. This could be as simple as a scheduler policy like `take the first queued goroutine that previously executed on this thread, looking upto 5 into the queue, otherwise take the first one` instead of `always take the first one`. The difficulty with this strategy is you could experience starvation of goroutines, and there are a ton of other complexities, which is why the current scheduler is so simple. I believe this will get better...<p>Context switching isn't the issue with threaded implementations of servers. Writing a server with a thread per connection is a bad idea because of the memory requirements. 1000 connections will lead to gigabytes of memory in use.<p>I don't think Go's performance envelope has shrunk or become less predictable, IMO. I think what we've given up is control over what threads execute what goroutines, essentially, the NUMA argument above. This will hopefully get better with time.",1333514084

I've been puttering on one on and off, but it's horribly broken so I haven't released it, so this one gets extra points for actually existing. :)<p>In case my half-done thoughts are useful to anyone looking to build something in this space:<p>My aim is/was to allow configurable matching, so you can match, e.g. ""XxxXxx / XxxXxx1 / XxxXxx / XxxXxx1"", meaning four consecutive lines of six syllables, where X is a stressed, and x an unstressed syllable, and where the last syllable of the 2nd and 4th lines have the same phoneme, denoted ""1"", whereas there are no phonemic constraints on any other syllables (this allows a crude approach to rhyme).<p>I'm not entirely happy with cmudict because, since it works one syllable at a time, it can't really do much about stress, which can vary depending on the surrounding words. I've been using the output of <i>espeak -x</i> instead, which gives a phonetic rendering of an entire sentence, including assigning both phonemes and stress. I'm not sure if it's genuinely an improvement though. Its poorly documented output surely isn't an improvement! And in particular it gives a normal prosaic reading of a sentence, which might be too constraining for poetry-finding, since poems often allow a bit of freedom on moving around the stresses.<p>The idea to scan large amounts of text is to compile the configurable pattern into a regex that matches espeak -x output, so for example X gets mapped to a ""match any stressed syllable"" regex snippet. Alas, that's error-prone, especially since the espeak -x phoneme format is a bit quirky (e.g. no fixed length per syllable or syllable markers, so you need to have some per-language rules to figure out what sequences of ASCII constitute what, which I haven't debugged).",1333514029

It's the <i>C Programming Language</i> of linguistic style guideswell-respected and historically relevant, but not necessarily the best resource.<p>For example, <i>The Elements of Style</i> tells you to avoid the passive voice, on the grounds that sentences like ""The sandwich was eaten by me,"" are much more awkward than ""I ate the sandwich."" It gives three sentences in support of this: ""There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground,"" ""It was not long before she was very sorry that she had said what she had,"" and ""The reason that he left college was that his health became impaired."" None of these sentences actually contain a passive: the first is an existential sentence, the second is a simple copula, and the third uses the copula with an adjective, not a participle.[1]<p>All of which is to sayStrunk and White did not know what a passive was. The actual advice they meant to give is something along the lines of, ""Don't be vague about agency,"" but that is a different proscription. There <i>are</i> places where you should avoid the passive, and there are also places where you should employ the passive, because <i>it is clearer than the alternative</i>. For example, if your documentation says, ""Our software product is used to [blah]"", you should not change it to, ""People use our software product to [blah],"" because <i>those people do not matter</i>. By avoiding the passive, you have made your writing less clear by introducing unnecessary information.<p>Strunk and White have a lot of advice which is merely harmless, but it is not a spectacular writing guide, except for the simplest, least elaborate kinds of writing. Truly great writing is not writing which follows those rules, but writing that knows <i>when</i> to follow such rules. For example, Orwell and Churchill, both quite excellent writers, use the passive significantly <i>more</i> than journalists of the time[2].<p>[1]: The <i>passive</i> transforms sentences of the form ""{noun1} {verb} {noun2}"" into ""{noun2} {be} {verb}ed [by {noun1}]""; it is (or should be) clear that these sentences cannot be transformed from the latter pattern into the former.<p>[2]: <a href=""http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003414.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003414.h...</a>",1333513312

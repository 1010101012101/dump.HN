I have a gazillion ideas how the interface should look like, but the problem is I'm constantly changing it as I'm never fully satisfied with the outcome. I know that prototype (MVP) should mostly be focused on the core proposition, but somehow I managed to convince myself into thinking that the experience must be absolutely flawless in order for early customers to like it and thus us having a higher chance of success. I'm primarily a PHP/RoR/Js developer but I have a great interest in design - I visit dribbble, smashingmag and co. on a daily basis.<p>I'm asking this question as I often find myself deciding too long on things like (css) shadow opacity and border color.<p>Any tips much appreciated!",1336921187

If they're interested in martial arts on their own, they might be very good.  Otherwise, a few months of training at any martial arts style that teaches immediately practical aspects like holds, joint locks, grappling, etc. will teach more than what cops know.  It's not practical.  Police procedure is designed to prevent officers from ever needing to get into serious hand to hand fights with criminals.<p>Most cops do not shoot violent criminals in the knees or shoulders because they are not that accurate.<p>In the Diallo shooting [1], 4 NYC police officers hit Diallo 19 times out of 41 rounds fired.<p>If a cop is a good shot, and is not under pressure, he or she can hit a suspect's knee.  Most shootings occur under high pressure, and most cops are not good shots.  Most cops qualify periodically as required under police regulations and that's all the firearms training they care about.<p>[1] <a href=""http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/d/amadou_diallo/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/peopl...</a>",1336921147

Let me just quickly point out a few things before I write up something longer about this thing.<p>First things first:<p>> I'd like to add that maybe Fireteam should have not chosen HTTP as a transfer protocol for games, where state is everywhere and HTTP is stateless. Although I don't feel qualified to suggest alternatives.<p>We have very good reasons for supporting HTTP but it's not the only protocol we're implementing.  As pointed out on one slide: HTTP is better supported than raw socket connections on certain devices we care about.<p>> Trying to over-abstract network communication is one of the classic mistakes in distributed system design.<p>We're not doing that.  If you look at the slides we're 100% HTTP compliant, we don't make some fancy schmancy protocol on that just uses HTTP as a transport layer but does not embrace it.  I have the ""pleasure"" to use SOAP in the past and this is not what we're after.<p>We're basically treating HTTP as an implementation detail for JSON/urlencoded etc. REST. and we do that by sprinkling a ton of meta information around in the code.  Once the request was dispatched to the function it's returned to the valuable information.  One layer higher all the HTTP logic happens.<p>The general workflow however is fundamentally different from what I did in the past with Flask or how Django works which also explains the title.<p>I will write something up because I think from the slides alone you get a completely wrong impression about why this is cool :-)",1336920577

Each user on this system could potentially feel the same power as a full desktop, as the probability of multiple users requiring intensive computation at the same time is relatively low.

Just like there's no such thing as a safe that can't be broken into, that's not the point of anti-piracy measures.<p>Piracy is a problem because it requires minimal effort and is far too easy these days, often easier than obtaining the content legitimately.   If the copyright holders could just occasionally shutdown whatever the most popular site is at the time, and force people to smaller sites.  Far less people would be pirating.<p>The crux of the problem is that it is incredibly easy to pirate things, and even a token/whack-a-mole effort would dissuade most people.<p>Look at web-advertising.

The probability of any of these warning shots actually hitting, hurting or even killing someone is extremely low. I'm not aware of any warning shot fired by the German police ever hurting anyone.<p>So, 50 years or so of warning shots and no one was hurt. If a warning shot kills someone today, those 50 years of warning shots only had to save two lives (someone decides to give up instead of seeking confrontation and being killed) to be worth it.<p>I think it's pretty simple, actually. On the whole, warning shots seem quite beneficial, that more than outweighs the low probability of hurting or killing someone.<p>But humans are bad at dealing with probability, so your error is understandable.",1336917748

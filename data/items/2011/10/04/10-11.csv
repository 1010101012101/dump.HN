3070261,comment,3069299,3070174,4,0,earbitscom,,,"Economic theory ought to have taught you that there is more to bringing a product to market than how much is costs to duplicate that product after it's been invented.<p>The scarcity of good music is real, and its not found in its distribution model. Youre neglecting to acknowledge the complexity of the process that goes into the creation of that product in the first place. Sure, you can duplicate an MP3 with next to no cost. But duplicating a digital file that nobody enjoys is not the point. Were talking about duplicating something that hundreds of thousands or millions of people want.<p>To even have that file to duplicate, we have to go back to the 5 year old kid who first picked up the guitar. Lets account for the thousands of hours they practiced their craft until they were good enough to even begin to be capable of making something people will enjoy. The number of people who will enjoy a recording of just one guitar playing is very few, so they work with group after group of other musicians, failing to create a product that a lot of people like.<p>One day, at around 25 years old, this person stumbles into a room with 3 other people who have spent thousands of hours practicing their own instruments, and, for the first time ever, they start creating music that will have mass appeal. They spend months writing music together. Sometimes those people dont get along, but they fight through it because the product theyre making is that difficult to create with other people. After months writing, and more months practicing, they finally have the blueprints for a product that people will enjoy and want their own copy of. But its just in their heads.<p>Now, these people either invest their own money, or they go through painstaking lengths to attract an investor by way of a record label. That record label, in exchange for an investment in them and for lending them connections and years of expertise, takes a significant percentage of the returns from their sales. Or, they go it alone, keeping the lions share of their sales, but having to invest all of their own money and their own time managing the business side of what they bring to market.<p>After weeks or months in the studio, working with a producer, several professionally trained production engineers, a mixing engineer, a mastering engineer, and other highly specialized experts in their field, they finally have a high quality recording.<p>Now, they take that recording, the sum total of 4 peoples years of practice, their creativity, talent, dedication and hard work, and they make a CD of it. They pay for duplication of CDs and make digital downloads available online. All the while this was happening, they were building up fans by touring, engaing in social marketing, fliering clubs, and doing anything else they can think of or get their friends to help with to spread the word about their upcoming album. When the album is ready, they hit the road, touring endlessly, stuck in a van with people who they may or may not even like that much, living on pennies as they try to make people aware of their music.<p>This, my friend, is the assembly line. It is not the duplication that happens in the computer. The product is assembled over 15-20 years of intense work, combined with a dozen strokes of luck culminating in the right people meeting, creating that product, and getting the necessary financing to roll it out to the public.<p>Now, you think its not worth $0.99 because it doesnt cost anything to make extra copies?  Even if that were remotely true, if you want this magical process to happen again, you might want to make sure these people can eat.",1317724918

3070241,comment,3069556,3069556,11,0,6ren,,,"> spectacular business failures over the next decade as the incumbents who fail to engage the ""technical creative class"" are eviscerated by nimbler and more tech-savvy operators<p>Sorry, this is encouraging for us here, but I think it's silly. Clayton Christensen studied why strong incumbents fail. He found again and again that incumbents were the best at adopting new technology, even radical architectural changes, <i>provided that the technology gave an improvement that was valued by their customers.</i><p>They failed when the new technology wasn't valuable to their customers. Even when they developed the technology in-house, to a level of excellence, it didn't help them - if their customers didn't want it. The reason it eventually caused them to fail was that <i>other</i> people did want it, and firms grew up to service them. Eventually, the new technology improved enough so that the incumbents' customers also  wanted it - but they bought from the new guys, who had by now become the ""incumbents"" for that technology, and had all aspects of the business worked out (engineering, product design, brand, advertising, channels, distribution, support etc).<p>It will be the same here: if incumbents can harness new technology to serve their customers, they will do so. If they are fighting for their lives,  <i>will</i> put their massive resources into play to secure the necessary  technical talent.<p>And the danger that is hard for them to fight: other firms serving different customers, with technology that one day will be good enough for their customers (but not yet).<p>e.g. target people who cannot afford the incumbents' product, with a product that's not good enough for the incumbents' customers.<p>e.g. target people who can't use the incumbents' product in a specific situation, with a product that is not as good as the incumbents' product in the usual situation.<p>e.g. target people who lack the time, skills or expertise to use the incumbents' product (i.e. not worth the hassle), with a product that is not as good as the incumbents' product for their customers (who do have the time, skill, expertise).<p>This is the mechanism - avoid threatening incumbents, and you have a chance. Threaten them, and they will kick your ass (you will ""provoke a competitive response""). It's not as simple as lacking technical expertise.",1317724201

So we have a profileration of operating systems, redundant software reinventing wheels etc.<p>Open source is interesting in that regard. It's sort of the solution to a lot of the mess -- in theory, by making the source public, nobody should ever need to solve a problem more than once, and a specific piece of problem-solving code should evolve over time into the perfect solution -- but it's screwed by the competitive nature of <i>people</i>.

They also compete against the status quo; what I like to call the ""not invented by me"" syndrome which drives people to create new stuff even though what they really ought to have done is to improve the old stuff, thus expanding the pile of legacy software even further.)<p>Why do we have both Python and Ruby? They are incredibly similar to each other. They are so similar it's silly. Sure, one's got whitespace-sensitive syntax, the other has runtime-extensible OO. But those are superficial differences, and nobody can objectively say that Python is better than Ruby, or vice versa. Do we really need both? And yet Matz and Guido are never going to join forces to work together on a common goal to create a single, superior technology.<p>Open source ought to work less like capitalism.

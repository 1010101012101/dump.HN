It's not the only way. It's one way. There are lots of ways to build a product and run a business. Getting Real is what we've learned. Same with REWORK - it's our experience and advice in book form. Neither book pretends to be the only way.<p>If you have your own unique approach, and you think your experience can be valuable to those who haven't had your experience, take the time to write it up and share it with the world.",1337741933

4011302,comment,4011231,4011231,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"The suit against Nasdaq is fascinating in principle. In brief, trading started nearly an hour late and there were difficulties with trade confirmation. Now, the sinking price is also a reflection of a) weaker public demand than underwriters may have anticipated and b) disquiet over dubious accounting/disclosure in the runup to the IPO. But clearly, delays and stumbles right at the commencement of trading took a lot of air out of the balloon.<p>How to value this, though, is a very difficult question that will most likely be left to a jury. Assuming NASDAQ were found to be negligent, it could be messy; Facebook's market cap has gone down by $20 billion since it began trading (or $39bn peak-to-trough).

So, it's definitely very motivating and I recommend to skim it instantly if you haven't done it before.<p>But at the same time it's pretty old now and if you read HN for more than 3 months then the book won't offer any surprise. And though it's not very much about Rails or programming it still transports a specific and opinionated mindset about how life and in particular entrepreneurship has to work. From 37signals' point of view it's the <i>only</i> way how entrepreneurship should be approached while heavily despising other ways, as recently seen in DHH last post about players like Pinterest, Instagram or Quora. So, it's pretty much like Railsthere is only <i>one</i> way and no otherand thus, you should take some messages of the book with a grain of salt and be aware that it's aged and to some extent just a leverage for email Marketing for 37signals (also aging) products.",1337741490

You could easily use the same kinds of arguments for why we should abandon corporations, governments, or really anything at all.<p>When you look at the majority of Unions- and yes, even those in California- they are one of the few things holding the economy up. As much as I'm one of those who wants to push science, evolution, and transhumanism to it's limit, when it comes down to it, a distributed economy beats a top-heavy economy every time, no matter what. Every example of economies with this large a difference in income disparity ends in disaster- literally every example we've ever had. There are no examples of where it was a good thing.<p>The common sentiment of futurists is 'a little pain to get us to utopia', but the problem is, that pain can kill us very quickly. Without unionized labor, you immediately and wholeheartedly condemn millions to poverty. Furthermore, you're simultaneously abolishing free speech- for what's the use of free speech, if no one can hear you?<p>My biggest issue with the anti-union crowd is that they don't realize that Unions are just another competing force, except instead of competing in the marketplace, they're competing in the production line. Why do you think our golden example, Silicon Valley, has managed to stay away from unions? It's because of treating their workers pretty damn well, by anyone's standards.<p>But as long as there are people working 16 hour days in 110 degree weather for $20 an hour in Central California, WITH the help of a union?

And it is likely to attract serious disagreement.  Take this as on man's opinion and nothing else.<p>It is my contention that in modern times unionized labor has done absolutely nothing good for our society.  I understand that they had a time and a place to exist.  Today, there's far more evidence of the damage they cause than the positive effects they may have been intended to produce.<p>Unions create a false economy.  One where people are paid exorbitant amounts of money for work that could be done for less in an open market.  Unions also create stagnation both in terms of innovation and of human capital.  Union members exist in an isolated cocoon where there is no need to excel or evolve past your station.  Unions damage competitiveness at a national and international level.  Unions damage the economy and destroy industries by creating contracts with unreasonable terms, benefits and pensions.  Unions in government create a nasty conflict-of-interest situation where hordes of people vote as a unified block supporting the very laws and politicians that regulate their own jobs (vote for your own pay raise, etc.).  Unions also use this vote-by-mob approach to influence politics and the politicians that want their votes.<p>It is my opinion that unionized workers, as individuals, are  generally good hard-working people.  However, once their thoughts and actions are controlled by the need to support their ""team"" (the union) the collective can, and often becomes, evil in many ways.  Case in point:  UAW contract clause that causes car companies to have to retain workers displaced by automation.  These workers earn full salary to do absolutely nothing.  The Chinese have got to be laughing their asses off when they see us self-destruct this way.<p>Teacher unions are yet another example.  The list of evils is too long to list here.  The most basic one is the inability to fire bad or even down-right criminal teachers.<p>We would be able to move at a very different pace if unions went away.  I won't hold my breath.",1337738827

I am a graduating undergraduate student, and interned with the startup team previously when they were working in research at BigCo. They left, licensed their own hardware patents from BigCo, and are starting up. They are asked me to join them in return for housing reimbursement, a meager living allowance, and an uncertain amount of equity.<p>I know it depends on how much risk I am willing to shoulder, but what would be reasonable terms for salary and equity, considering I'm a fresh grad?<p>They would bring me on as an early engineering hire, and they are currently bootstrapping from savings while working on the product and courting angels. Series A would certainly be far off. The founders have solid connections, and have brought in an experienced woman to act as CEO/advisor until they have funding. She was previously the CEO of a well-regarded company in the same space.<p>The equity would be in the form of RSU, and salary would increase after angel funding, and to market rate later on or with Series A.

I think the last ten years have been about the interpreted ""scripting"" languages and it's become obvious the next major PL niche is one of these safer-yet-systems-level languages, so in addition to the ongoing research it seems to me like there's been a burst of work on these, with more to come. D is among the most mature, and the least revolutionary, with all that entails. Mozilla is doing Rust. Go arguably fits into this area, though I'm not sure it's quite meant for kernels per se. (It is a systems level language, though.)<p>But given that 2040 was the year tossed in, I was also thinking the next generation after that, where some of the next-next generation of verification would be folded in. There you're looking at Haskell as being the gateway into that world (even though it is not really <i>that</i> verifiable in the strongest sense itself, it gets your foot in the door), and the Coq and Agda and the slowly-but-surely increasingly usable proof assistants, which would be useful for a provable-not-corruptable (via normal software means) software kernel.<p>Though... if one looks at the rate of advance in kernels over the past 30 years and then project out to the next 30, we get a distressingly high probability of it still being in C. Still, I cautiously optimistically (or pessimistically, depending) think that the hardware revolution that we are still only at the beginning of as we run out of Moore's Law is going to produce non-C languages that will eventually be irresistible to produce kernels in. There's going to be ever more constraints we want to maintain and it's going to get harder and harder to maintain them without some sort of language support beyond what C can supply.",1337738621

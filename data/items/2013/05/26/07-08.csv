I am trying to learn it myself, so bare with me if I make any mistakes.<p>They throw words like polynomial and I've asked people with comp sci degrees to define what they are. I get back replies like ""We learned it as a polynomial and never got a definition of it."" OK look, here is what it means and some people with a comp sci PHD cannot even tell me, poly means many, right, and nomial like numbers or formulas or rather in computer science and algorythm. You have to study how algorithms work, I asked this on Hacker News and many tried to bury the story because most couldn't even answer that, and thanks to those who did. I am glad to see someone else bring it up and hope it sheds more light on it.<p>Consider this, that you really cannot get a good estimate of how long any algorithm can run because you got other factors in play. You got multicore CPUs now, and some of the work is offloaded to GPUs as well (like Bitcoin mining programs using GPUs, well now algorithms can use GPUs for some of the processing), plus you got caches on processors you didn't have in 1971, not only that but the law of thermodynamics applies to computers and electronics and many people forget that, so if your CPU is over heating it could slow down if you have a variable fan it could cool the CPU down and it runs faster for a bit and then heats up and slows down a bit, most operating systems are multitasking so the program that runs the algorithm might take longer if the Apache HTTPD server is in use with heavy traffic on the server the algorythm runs on, not only that but Anonymous might have sent a DDoS attack to your server the algorithm is running on.

5770388,comment,5769992,5770200,9,0,tensor,,,"Another counter-example. I found my PhD both more and less constraining than a startup, at the same time. For reference, I obtained a PhD, and I am now doing a startup.<p>There are things that a startup can never replace. Most notably, access to domain experts whose goal is obtaining knowledge. In startup land, you get massive amounts of anecdote, but little knowledge. Almost all of that anecdote is geared towards earning money to the exclusion of all else. In academia, you get essentially the opposite.<p>The reason I say that academia can be more constraining is that often you end up focussing on a single problem to the exclusion of all else. This can, but certainly does not always, harm your breadth of knowledge. In transition to a startup, the biggest difference to me was dispensing with ""publish or perish.""<p>I've reproduced and experimented with more existing work than I ever did during my PhD. That's mostly because reproducing existing work doesn't earn you anything in academia, despite being a cornerstone of science. You spend as much time, and only as much time, reading background work as is necessary to do something new. Without having to publish, I've been free to really expand my breadth and understand which methods work and which don't in my new domain.<p>All that said, what I'm doing in a startup is largely still applied research. This is a whole different beast than I see in most startups. Their goals appear to be chasing populism and money. The antithesis of academia.",1369554631

5770376,comment,5768449,5770144,1,0,klibertp,,,"I strongly disagree. First, it's possible that reading ""Tree"" is harder than reading ""T"", but that doesn't mean that the time needed to understand an expression composed from Ts is shorter than the time to understand Trees. I think - I have no proof, but so you don't for the contrary claim - that the time needed to decipher the meaning of abbreviated variable is greater than short variables save.<p>As for the type system - I like it strong, static and abstract. It's true that defining GADT happens on a level so high, that some of the type parameters can stand for literally anything, and naming them something other than ""a"" or ""x"" or ""o"" would be silly. That <i>doesn't</i> mean that the type system makes you abbreviate every single name used in definitions. The same goes for overusing infix functions. In Haskell this seems to be a cultural thing: in OCaml, for example, while signatures are really terse, the types, types constructors, etc. are named (almost) always with full words. The same happens in Scheme, or more exactly in Typed Racket, where lack of syntactic support means that you need more letters to be able to easily decipher the meaning. In Erlang, where they use ""success typing"" as an add-on to the language, this too holds true.<p>There is that language, J - descendant of APL. I actually went and learned some of it. Now, J <i>is</i> a mathematical notation and while it is quite nice as far as array languages go, it is hardly the best general purpose language. Probably because it's a mathematical notation. Yet even in J, functions other than the core vocabulary are named with full words. Sometimes with a few words.<p>I have nothing against maths or Haskell. What I want to say is that over-shortening everything is a sign of elitist behavior, which is reinforced by the community, and which serves no useful purpose, and that there are communities gathered around Haskell alternatives which were able to mitigate this problem. As long as no one provides me with a proof that overusing shortened to 2 characters names is beneficial to the readers program understanding, I think I won't change my mind.",1369554127

The idea that we need such a thing as a ""framework"" is I think mistaken but understandably so: we've only had viable module systems and package management for a short amount of time and they are still evolving.<p>But module systems and package managers change <i>everything</i> about how open source ecosystems work! When you've got a package manager that is trivially easy to publish to, you remove pressure on libraries upstream to include extra functionality into their cores because users have too hard of a time fetching the functionality for themselves otherwise. With pervasive package management and a culture modularity, modules can be smaller because they can depend on other modules instead of inlining functionality or otherwise being overly cautious about dependencies. Convergence under this kind of fitness landscape tends toward narrowly-focused single-purpose libraries that do just one thing and do it well.<p>Popular frameworks have already severely dwindled in size from something extjs, mootools, or yui scale towards something backbone-sized. I sincerely hope that frameworks dwindle away into nothingness so that focused, reusable libraries that take simple inputs and produce simple outputs can fill the gap because the severe orthogonality and opportunities for novel recombination are so much greater!",1369553937

In general case, without the euro, they could let their currency take a dive and become a better opportunity to invest. However while they have Euro and have strong economies like Germany tied to the Euro, the Euro won't sink enough for them to be profitable and whenever it does sink, it just makes Germany more concurrent than them in the global market.

5770356,comment,5769295,5769295,15,0,rakeshpai,,,"I think I might have 2c to clarify the OP's stand, having worked on a mobile XMPP client before. This is with regards to his point about bandwidth and battery usage on mobile.<p>XMPP is a connection-oriented stateful protocol. The connection setup process is very expensive: Connect, authenticate, advertise the list of supported client features, get the roster (contacts), and IIRC presence exchange, etc. Therefore, once you've established a connection, you really don't want it to break. Even just reconnecting is very expensive.<p>However, in the mobile scenario, regular connection breakage is the norm. What most mobile based clients will then do is proxy the XMPP connection on the server-side and connect to the client over HTTP instead. This is well defined in the BoSH spec (XEP:124). BoSH was originally designed for web-based clients, but happens to meet the need of the mobile use-case.<p>However, when it comes down to implementation, there are several optimizations that can be applied:<p>1. The roster exchange at the connection time is very expensive, and usually only sends data to the client that the client probably has already stored locally from a pervious session. Connection overhead can be reduced drastically if there was some way of versioning the roster and only transferring deltas. This was the OP was referring to. (Roster versioning, XEP:273).<p>2. Presence packets are one of the most chatty aspects of the protocol (x went offline, x is now online, etc). I've heard someone say that it constitutes about 80% of the packets on a typical connection, but this is anecdotal. In cases where the user isn't actively interacting with the client, having presence packets being sent all the time seems wasteful. One way to tackle this is to buffer up and de-duplicate the presence packets on the server, and send them in batches only when necessary. (For example, if x goes online, then offline, then online again, and then goes 'busy', the client only needs to know that x is busy.) I think this is what the OP was referring to when he mentioned the google:queue for delayed presence delivery. This alone can be a huge win for battery and bandwidth, since transferring data and processing it can be reduced drastically.<p>Aside: Presence is so chatty, that some mobile clients simply don't handle presence at all. Take WhatsApp for example. It doesn't show whether every person in your list of contacts is online. The assumption is that every user is online by the nature of the device, and this assumption works in the common cases. In the edge cases is where you'd need to buffer up messages. This reduces chattiness drastically, making the protocol seem much more lightweight. (WhatsApp is based on XMPP, but have spun it off into their own thing.)<p>Just thought I'd add these points to the discussion here, since there seemed to be some lack of understanding of the protocol. IMHO, the XML, as verbose as it is, isn't really the problem. The protocol itself is verbose and whether the transport uses XML or whatever else is of comparatively little consequence. This verbosity of the protocol (and not so much the format of data transfer) has its effect on battery life and bandwidth usage.",1369553394

Talented engineers were sucked up into the machinery of the Cold War and put to use designing and building ICBMs, cruise missiles, nuclear weapons, fighter planes, and so forth. But on the other hand, that had a huge opportunity cost because it meant those people weren't working on other things. And while we still ended up with a lot of amazing civilian inventions in that time, some even due to spinoffs from Cold War technology, we should have no illusions that we probably missed out on others.<p>Rocket technology for one. It was almost impossible for ""startups"" to work on orbital launchers during the Cold War, for obvious geopolitical reasons. Much of our launch vehicle technology was based off of ICBM work, but there are some problems with that, since launch vehicles need to be considerably more reliable even than a missile designed to carry nuclear weapons. More so, the design of strategic weapons on the scale of importance of ICBMs tends to leave issues of cost by the wayside, whereas the same is not true for commercial launchers. Since the end of the Cold War there's been a flourishing of space-based startups, many of them seeing a considerable amount of success lately (SpaceX, Orbital Sciences, XCOR, Blue Origin, etc.) Potentially if the same sort of business and geopolitical environment had existed in the 1960s it's quite possible that we would have seen much faster advances in spaceflight than we have seen historically.<p>An that's just one aspect, who knows what else would have happened if many of the best engineering minds of a generation had not been lured (through monetary reward, through prestige, through a sense of national duty) into designing missiles and bombs.",1369553274

I come from a family of doctors and I have learned also through my life that doctors are usually just guessing, and going by what they have learned and what our current understanding of humans has taught us.  If they say that ""there is nothing wrong with you"" what they mean is that there is nothing that you have that they can diagnose and treat.  That doesn't mean that there isn't something wrong. Please don't do what I do, and what pretty much everyone does when there is no identifiable illness to blame: blame yourself. Actually, it sounds like the doctor helped you along with that by saying that it was your fault.  That's perfect.  My doctor did the same thing when she couldn't find a reason for why i was in agony every night and was taking like 30 Immodium a day to quell my stomach pains.  If gastroenterologists don't find something to pin it on, then ""there is nothing wrong with you"". So they turn it on you.  There is clearly something wrong with you, whether a doctor has a name for it or not.  And it is not your fault. If the identification of a problem in your health makes you slow down and smell the roses, or the carnations, or whatever is in your vicinity that you haven't been smelling enough of, then great.  But DO NOT blame yourself for your current problem.  It is likely not a result of any action of yours.  It is just something that happened.  It might be a rare disorder that hasn't yet been identified or that only a small group of specialists knows about.  Have you researched it online? Of course you have.  You might look around for researchers into things like this.  There is probably some small group somewhere which is looking into this very disorder, which is rare, and is usually attributed to overwork, or too much reading.\npeace and best wishes.",1369553064

It rebalanced the workday so that the high wages could be spent on acquiring capital, and thus be redeployed into other activities that, among other things, started new businesses and broke up market monopolies.",1369551888

That's different from the world falling apart because no one wants to clean the toilets.<p>What will happen to price levels? It depends on the exact level of the basic income, but here's a likely scenario for my preferred level (around $10k-$12k per adult citizen).<p>The effects are much more strongly seen for things that require low skilled labor than high skilled: those low skilled workers now have an alternative, of not working. Some extra number of them over today would take that option, but most still will work: everyone still has the same incentive--more money!--to work. The big difference would be everyone has a pile of so-called ""fuck you"" money, which helps eliminate any monopsony power employers at the lower end of the market have.<p>So those costs would rise, because costs on the supply side have risen. Products and services provided by highly skilled workers would see nary a change in their cost structures: most of us get paid enough in a year to consume a decade at minimum income levels, but we choose not to do that.<p>The pattern of consumption would also be altered, depending on how the funding tax was structured. A reasonable proposal (perhaps a flat tax on all income over the basic guaranteed one) you'd expect to result in luxuries to be demanded compared to necessities.<p>Overall you get higher prices and higher consumption of basic necessities, and lower prices and lower consumption of luxuries.<p>(This is all secondary, in my view, to the core of what a basic income would allow: a grand infusion of both market entrepreneurship and non-easily-monetizable value into the economy. )",1369551676

It is now known that there are many languages and more than one ""right"" choice. If asked about technology, saying you write software in Clojure, which runs on the JVM and uses Java libraries is accepted as a perfectly valid answer.<p>* Certain concepts have a fundamental complexity and cannot be simplified any further. Clojure got a lot of things right. Trying to ""trickle down into mainstream languages"" sounds like a hopeless task: you will end up either dumbing things down or making them difficult to use because other supporting parts of the language aren't there.",1369551641

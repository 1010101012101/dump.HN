Disks are easy to use, they are not that easy to damage and you can have each copy of data synchronised on 2-3 different DCs easily using Amazon network during night times (low network usage).",1398452399

Ideally, this is running on a separate instance.<p>- An SHSM system that exposes nothing but a simple remote API for sealing and unsealing secrets. Seal: secret->token; unseal: token->secret. The SHSM is on separate hardware, unshared by any other service.<p>- A backend system, hardened and carefully assessed (but not as hardened as the SHSM) that performs the operations that require the secrets and stores its results where the front-end can get access to them.<p>This design needs to recognize that:<p>* The minimalized secret-accepting front-end can be compromised and, if that happens, an attacker can &quot;camp&quot; n the front-end and collect secrets regardless of what else you do. That&#x27;s why you segment this functionality from the main front-end.<p>* A serious flaw in the rest of the front-end might transitively give an attacker a pivot to owning up the secret-accepting front-end; this could be direct (for instance, if both share a database) or indirect (if the minimalized front-end renders attacker-controlled content accepted in the front-end).<p>* There needs to be a diode-like relationship between the secret-acceptor and the SHSM; the SHSM must allow the secret-acceptor to seal a secret in such a way that it can&#x27;t later unseal it, else it&#x27;s serving no real purpose (an attacker that compromised the secret-acceptor would be able to unseal all secrets).<p>* The SHSM itself must be locked down to exactly the minimum set of services required to perform the seal/unseal operation.<p>* Ideally, the security of the SHSM asymptotically approaches that of a real HSM; for instance, a hardware-augmented root-of-trust might be used to make it difficult for an attacker that (improbably) gains code-execution capability to instantiate their own SHSM process to decrypt secrets.<p>* The backend service, which might have unlimited access to the secrets stored in the SHSM, is itself a prime target of attack through clientside vulnerabilities (this is why you want to segment it off from the SHSM). Some combination of rate-limiting, anomaly detection, privilege, and user-permissions (a system might be designed to prevent the unsealing of a secret without some action having happened in the front-end within a window of time).<p>None of these problems are easy. You might plan on spending somewhere between 4x-10x the amount of time designing, building, verifying, and monitoring this system than you would a system doing something similarly complex with non-secret data.",1398452397

But the fact that I could not find it while trying to scratch my itch tells me this book has potential to reach people like me the other books have not addressed.<p>Secondly, although interviews with the founders of Freelancer and Udemy makes for a nice brand building exercise, their interviews are not the USP of the book. I think this book is useful because it tells the stories from people who are not media darlings - people who run baking shops, vegetable growers, yoga schools; people who make their own jewelry and sell on Etsy. The stories and struggles of these people are not chronicled. Even if they are, they must be available as a 99 cent ebook on Kindle that has not really reached many.<p>This book consolidates the experiences from the ultra-successful and those who have failed, people who face challenges from multiple aspects like money, gender, industry, etc. And reading all of this in one place is definitely a useful alternative to the umpteen books that one must read for the same purpose.",1398452254

If not targeted to clang output too much, you can then transpile any LLVM-able language to Rust.<p>I think, but am not sure, that the problem with Rust being a target for these other languages (my pipe dream is to write a JVM in it w/ a JIT using the bootstrapped rustc lib) is that you have to use unsafe code all the time (unless there&#x27;s 0 performance penalty for ARC) because the original code is not written with ownership/borrowing semantics.",1398452095

The biggest difficulty I have with accepting isolated mixes of nutrients and supplements is that when we consume and metabolize food, or anything, we don&#x27;t do it in isolation. There are hosts of synergistic effects throughout biology that are difficult to understand and accurately replicate.<p>No I&#x27;m not a nutritionist or a biologist, so what I&#x27;m saying is admittedly highly qualitative. But I did work for several years on a project to curb improper disposal of pharmaceutical waste (into toilets where it gets into the water system), because I read hundreds of papers and articles about how scientists simply don&#x27;t understand yet how different pharmacological compounds might mix in water and have synergistic consequences for wildlife, especially as it bioaccumulates up the food chain. (Side note, this will be hard to understand since so much of our studies are focused on isolating on variable and looking for effects ceteris paribus, but this isn&#x27;t how systems work in reality.)<p>The difference to me when we breed food is that at least we&#x27;re still consuming something in an evolutionary context, bred over several generations. Certainly it still could be bad for us, but I think that the plant/ animal itself is surviving is better evidence than just taking its component parts and ingesting them.

I figured everyone is greedy, either he is an employee or an employer, or your customer. So when you stop being one, It changes everything. You instantly stand out, and you can win peoples heart in no time. Which in the long run, helps you make much more money, than if you were being greedy. You perhaps will make little to no money, at first. But in the long run it’s all jackpot.<p>How did I learn this tactic?<p>First of all it’s no brainer, but we just do not pay attention to it. Instead our entire focus is on the bottom-line. In early teens, I used to frequently visit my car stereo dealer, I would buy anything for my car stereo, that money could. So one day, I visited him again and asked him to replace my car speakers, with the new ones. I told him, I guess they have worn out. He said, no worries and unpacked a brand new pair in front me. But He asked, since you listen music in higher volume, it’s likely your hearing is little distorted, which is very much likely for guys like me, than the speakers has worn out. He said, I can easily sell you new ones and make my profit too, But I won’t just recommend. Even after 15 years I am still one of his loyalist customers.

You partially eliminate a few strawmen, and thus conclude that your pet theory is the only answer?  The logic in this article is so weak that I presume this must be an example of &#x27;parallel construction&#x27;.  I have to guess that someone he trusts but is not allowed to quote has told him that Amazon is using BDXL disks, and he&#x27;s pretending to reason himself to the same conclusion.  My next best guess is that he&#x27;s a few weeks late on his April Fool&#x27;s post.<p><i>Assuming aggressive forward pricing by Panasonic or TDK, Amazon probably paid no more than $5/disc or 5¢/GB in 2012. Written once, placed in a cartridge, barcoded and stored on a shelf, the $50 media cost less than a hard drive – Blu-ray writers are cheap – Amazon would recoup variable costs in the first year and after that mostly profit.</i><p>OK, maybe the April Fool&#x27;s explanation should come first.  Because if you were trying to come up with plausible logic, surely you could do better than declaring that Amazon&#x27;s private price for BDXL media is 1/5th that known to the public and that all other costs are zero.  And even if one were to assume this admittedly unlikely scenario, wouldn&#x27;t you need to write more than one disk for redundancy?  But that&#x27;s easy to solve:  just wave the magic wand and halve Amazon&#x27;s secret price down to a level where it make sense.<p>Powered down hard drives seem like a much simpler explanation.  The robotics don&#x27;t seem that difficult if instead of bringing the disk to the backplane you keep the disk fixed in place and just attach the cable.  Presumably you could design your own sturdier and easier to align connector, and leave the adapter in place.  Or maybe there is some way to do it with a mechanical switch?  Or do you even need a robot?  If you built a jig so you could plug in a whole drawer of drives at once, maybe you could just hire someone to do it.",1398451237

A better example is probably a rural WISP; huge bandwidth from tower to the 300-500 max users, but limited backhaul from the tower to your hundreds of miles away central location.<p>On 2), if you don&#x27;t offer colocation to third parties, but only to your content partners, that works well IFF you can incent your end users to hit those servers preferentially.  If that means offering iptv from them for $20/mo which doesn&#x27;t come out of your bandwidth cap, and having a 200 GB/mo cap for other traffic, that is a win for everyone except netflix.  If you aren&#x27;t allowed to say &quot;iptv from our servers is cap-free, everything else is capped&quot;, users hitting Netflix will continue to saturate the backhaul and no one will use the local media server iptv.<p>(I&#x27;m not necessarily saying net neutrality is a bad idea (or a good idea), but that there are specific user-beneficial cases which net neutrality hurts.  I&#x27;m concerned that Comcast basically can rape everyone <i>today</i> with the laws that are in place, and is entirely likely to use net neutrality laws to do so as well -- they&#x27;re a perfect example of an incumbent being so big that regulations just serve to entrench them.  Competition is the answer, and net neutrality in some ways helps competition among pure-IP cloud-delivered services, but hurts competition among access providers.)",1398450992

7648223,comment,7645044,7647195,5,0,rayiner,,,"As a background consideration, keep in mind that we&#x27;re talking about the search of a house, which is the absolute heart of the 4th amendment.<p>Warrantless entry and search of a house is considered per se unreasonable under the 4th amendment. There are a few narrow exceptions. First, a warrant is not required when the sole occupant of the house consents.[1] However, in a situation like this one where the defendant is present, his objection is enough to render the entry unlawful, even if the other person consents.[2]<p>Second, even if there is no consent, there are a few narrow exceptions the police can use. One of those is when &quot;exigent circumstances&quot; require the police to enter to prevent bodily harm or the destruction of evidence. But even in such cases, the acceptable scope of a warrantless search is limited by the circumstances that give rise to the exigency.[3]<p>So in this case, the girlfriend called the police saying he was threatening to kill her, which would justify, under the exigent circumstances exception, their entry onto the property. However, that did not authorize them to conduct a search of the house for evidence of domestic violence. The scope of their entry and search should have been limited to the exigent circumstance that justified the warrentless entry: ensuring her immediate safety. The police raised &quot;possible destruction of evidence&quot; as a reason for the search, but they had no reason to believe, until they searched, that there was evidence to preserve. The exigent circumstances that justified the entry was securing the safety of the girlfriend. Once they entered, they cannot shift their theory and say the exigent circumstance is preventing the destruction of evidence.<p>As for drugs, it depends. One of the other exceptions to the 4th amendment is that police are entitled to seize evidence in &quot;plain view&quot; during an otherwise lawful entry.[4] Had there been drugs strewn around the house, they would have been admissible. However, the video evidence was not in plain view. They had to go looking for it. If the police have to go looking for it, then that evidence is not admissible. That is true even when the evidence is drugs.<p>[1] Fernandez v. California, 571 U.S. __ (2014).<p>[2] Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U.S. 103 (2006).<p>[3] Mincey v.

There should not need to be a server-side flag required to enforce this behavior.<p>If you go to an HTTPS page on a given domain, your browser should always prefer the HTTPS page, even if you try to follow an HTTP page. The reason is, if you were able to reach the page via HTTPS before, you should be able to reach it there again, and HTTP would only expose you to an unencrypted page which is more than likely the same in content. The only downside is that sometimes HTTPS and HTTP URIs serve different resources even though the URI is the same (which I believe should be considered bad behavior by the web server)<p>Requiring admins to enable HSTS puts the onus on web server admins who are motivated to improve security for their users a tiny bit, and only works for admins who have servers that can support HSTS flags. There are many legacy systems which simply can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t be changed to support it.

Around 2007, all of those CD-R discs started becoming unreadable around the same time.<p>Video recordings were archived to DVD-R starting in 2003 with the same three copy approach.

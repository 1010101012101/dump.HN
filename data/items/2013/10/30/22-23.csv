6644084,comment,6642222,6643643,1,0,hershel,,,"Yes you&#x27;re right ,they are modular.<p>The change christensen refers to is the shift from companies that built whole computers, like IBM - to the IBM pc , which was an assembly of parts from different companies.<p>My guess is that at that time , the pc-XT came with memory chips that weren&#x27;t soldered , but in sockets. At that context that didn&#x27;t mean much loss of performance. That habit of pluggable memory stuck. I&#x27;m not sure you lose much performance due to it.<p>And if we&#x27;re talking about integrated memory - intel does have caches. Probably those are the best ways to deeply integrate memory.<p>And regarding CPU and board: it would be quite hard to integrate chips and board. There&#x27;s was one attempt i know but it failed as far as i know. It&#x27;s complex and not economical, but it does offer great performance.",1383173923

There are no business laptops with full screens on the market. Lenovo offered 4:3 and 16:10 models that were otherwise comparable for a very short period of time. Buyers, from what I remember of the period, did not tend to prefer the 16:10 models. I&#x27;m not sure if anybody else had a comparable overlap.

First of all-- what hustling recruiter is going to take their time to read this notice, and remember that X company has those conditions?<p>I&#x27;m a software developer, and I agree that recruiters don&#x27;t add nearly as much value as they claim to.  But I did a college summer internship at a recruiting firm and I understand their angle.<p>Not all hiring managers are honest enough not to just contact a candidate directly.  The anonymous resume is not meant to be a formal application, it&#x27;s meant to be a teaser to enter into a recruiting agreement and it&#x27;s a way of protecting themselves.<p>15% is pretty low for the industry. You&#x27;re just encouraging even lower quality candidate-finding with that method.<p>You specified how to contact them (on a job-per-job basis) but recruiters can work at a higher level than that.  Sometimes a candid call about their general talent needs helps a ton.  Like:  You&#x27;re advertising for a mid-level employee, but you&#x27;d be okay with a senior-level.<p>As a hiring manager, part of your job is to recruiter-wrangle.

Just trying to fill in details.<p>I merely want to avoid prematurely narrowing the range of functions that are possible. If we, for the moment, think of the neural computation of a single neuron as a neural network, then the spike/no-spike decision would be in the last layer and a whole host of linear/non-linear (some not necessarily boolean) functions could be implemented by the dendrites. And some single neuron processing we already know behaves in a non-boolean manner.<p>Be aware, just because arbitrarily powerful logic could be constructed solely out of boolean components (I don&#x27;t even know if this is true. Isn&#x27;t this kinda what is going on in an FPGA?) doesn&#x27;t mean that neural hardware is purposed the same way. They may very well may be analog, at least for some computations.<p>And to speak to your second paragraph, I should declare my personal biases. As a dendritic physiologist, I wasn&#x27;t much interested in whole-cell firing characteristics, but in the dendrite&#x27;s sub-threshold behavior.<p><i>How do a smattering of synaptic inputs, each with varying strengths, interact within the complex electrophysiological scaffolding provided by a branched dendrite layered with non-uniform, non-linear ion channel distributions?</i><p>So my perspective is somewhat inverted: To me, neuron firing is the implementation detail! <smilie face>",1383173831

6644037,comment,6634291,6638730,1,0,kevingadd,,,"As I explained in the parent post (which you failed to parse correctly - was my English too complex? I&#x27;m not the greatest at writing clearly), the advantage of the new streaming installer is that all user interaction is frontloaded, not that it adds new UI. I don&#x27;t know why you thought I was claiming the ability to pick an install directory is a new feature.<p>Anyway, my point re things like the blacklist and webgl rasterizer is that the browser is not completely installed without those components. The offline installer is <i>missing</i> key features and components of the browser; things that show up on feature lists that web applications can rely on. Without the WebGL rasterizer, WebGL demos won&#x27;t work in your offline-installed copy of Chrome in your VM without hardware accel. Without the GPU blacklist, on some configurations Firefox will be nonfunctional (or worse, crash your machine) because it attempts to do acceleration on a broken driver. Audio/video codecs are another area where it&#x27;s no longer possible to realistically ship &#x27;everything&#x27; in a single offline installer.<p>If you simply want an offline installer for a bare minimum browser that can do a stripped down subset of HTML5, it&#x27;s still possible to deliver that. But the amount of the &#x27;web&#x27; that works in that bare minimum installation will keep decreasing.<p>P.S. The reason Firefox has to install a service is because it&#x27;s not possible to install updates cleanly in any other fashion on UAC-enabled Windows. Your alternatives are installing into %AppData% (like chrome does, which removes the ability to pick an install dir and has other gross consequences) or requiring the user to UAC elevate every time an update installs. As I stated in the parent post, not installing updates puts users at risk when you&#x27;re dealing with a web browser - the attack surface is enormous.",1383173414

You&#x27;re allowed to refactor code internally, which definitely includes changing the structure of the internal functions.<p>Other coders who are also working inside the same module/API boundary will have their edits broken by this change. The original developer cannot fix their code because it&#x27;s not checked in yet.<p>> rather why they&#x27;re so eager to change a function signature without following up and either fixing the things they break, or flagging those things up to the people who require it.<p>I already explained why they can&#x27;t follow up - because the code that needs the follow up is in their codevelopers&#x27; working trees.  Flagging here would be silly. Almost <i>every single commit</i> would be &quot;flagged for fixing breakage&quot;, since every single commit can refactor/change <i>internal</i> function signatures.<p>> If there&#x27;s an error, somebody made a mistake. Some mistakes are stupid, others are subtle. Changing a method signature and then not doing something about the callers is a stupid mistake.<p>Yes, and we are all human so sometimes, despite heroic efforts, we will all make stupid mistakes as well as subtle mistakes.<p>Now, once we made the mistake, do we want our tool to insidiously hide this mistake from us, making it as expensive as possible to punish us for our mistake? Or do we want a tool that tells me ASAP &quot;Hey dude, you made a stupid mistake over there&quot;?<p>> but your job is to minimise the frequency and severity of those errors.<p>And to do this job, I have tools like languages that help me <i>find</i> those mistakes quickly.<p>> There&#x27;s no excuse for sloppiness<p>Making mistakes isn&#x27;t &quot;sloppiness&quot;, it&#x27;s human.<p>> Call it whatever you like, but a shitty broken codebase is only the fault of the developers, not the language<p>If one language makes writing a non-shitty codebase harder than a different language, it is also the fault of that language.",1383173248

This is a little scary to think their source code could have been exposed, given the $$$ flowing through their systems.<p>If either of them have any sense (which I think they do!) then having there source code exposed shouldn&#x27;t in and of itself pose a security risk. If it did then that would be security via obscurity.<p>Now I&#x27;m not saying that having the source code for a site is useless or that having it exposed is a good thing (it&#x27;s not!). If there is a bug/hole you could find it, but if there isn&#x27;t then the source being available should not make anything less secure.<p>> So, someone could have used these keys to have much wider access!<p>SSH keys and API tokens are another story. These need to be revoked immediately (CircleCI&#x27;s response looks great by the way) as there would be nothing besides firewall rules (if they exist!) preventing an attacker from using them.<p>This whole incident is a friendly reminder to follow the principle of least privilege[1] with your XaaS providers. There&#x27;s not much you can do for API tokens. If you&#x27;re relying on someone else to provide a service on your behalf then they&#x27;ll need their own token.<p>For data though it&#x27;s possible to encrypt sensitive data on your end and use the DBaaS provider as an opaque blob store. Doing it across the board gets a bit unwieldly as it&#x27;s hard to query encrypted data but it&#x27;s fine sensitive details that you don&#x27;t want to necessarily expose (such as ENV vars, payment info or equivalent tokens). If the provider doesn&#x27;t need access to X, and X is sensitive, then encrypt it before you save it with them. That way you don&#x27;t have to worry about them leaking it. One of the best examples of this approach is tarsnap[2] which considers <i>everything</i> sensitive and encrypts everything client side (on your machine) before uploading to its central server (and then S3).<p>EDIT: One more quick point. If you explicitly encrypt sensitive data as part of storing it (regardless of whether you&#x27;re using an XaaS provider or running a DB yourself) there&#x27;s one more big advantage: Backups!<p>Your backups themselves should be encrypted (ex: we use gpg prior to uploading them to S3) but in addition to that by following the above, the sensitive fields <i>in the backup</i> are also encrypted. This means that they&#x27;re encrypted in any scratch/temp files that are part of the backup generation process.<p>Otherwise they would be stored in <i>plaintext</i> on your server and possibly be on your server&#x27;s hard disk (or your XaaS providers disks) without you even knowing it. Oh and remember that disk blocks don&#x27;t actually get overwritten when you &quot;rm&quot; a file so this is more important than you think.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.tarsnap.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tarsnap.com/</a>",1383173003

The threat of violence is absolutely present in line-standing scenarios (imagine starving people in a bread-line; the biggest reason not to cheat is that fellow line-standers would kick your ass).<p>> But people are forced to use USD.<p><i>Sort of</i>, in the same sense that one is &quot;forced&quot; to engage in voluntary labor in order to survive. If one were to go live in the woods, they could hunt and forage without ever touching a greenback. However, to nearly everybody, the benefits of USD (and labor) outweigh the costs, or at least they act that way.<p>Obviously, many of our existing social structures are backed by centralized violence, both at the nation-state and community levels. But my point is that this is just as true of gold or BitCoin as it is of USD and taxes. While common decency will prevent most people from taking your stuff, at the end of the day, the threat of violence is what keeps someone from stealing your gold, or beating you with a wrench until you give up your BTC encryption key. There is no reality in which there is not an incentive to use violence, even if only to stop other violence.<p>Clearly, &quot;social contract&quot; is a broken metaphor: none of us signed a goddamn thing simply from being born. It bothers me as well that I effectively have no say in the matter, and that I am tacitly complicit in the various injustices of the state. I would vastly prefer opt-in distributed nation-tribes, such as Neal Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;phyles&quot;.<p>But at the same time, there is a strong possibility that if governments were to evaporate tomorrow, we would revert first to &quot;nature red in tooth and claw&quot;, eventually giving way to networks of feudalistic allegiances, in both cases, backed by extreme violence. Should we invent new post-national social structures (perhaps with actual social contracts that people choose voluntarily)? Of course, the sooner the better!

We will select licensing terms that allow for this code to be used in commercial products as well as open source projects. In order for Cisco to be responsible for the MPEG LA licensing royalties for the module, Cisco must provide the packaging and distribution of this code in a binary module format (think of it like a plug-in, but not using the same APIs as existing plugins), in addition to several other constraints.

What is new about that? just because google give you that feature if you pay them with your data, does not make it free for everyone. so it is not in place for firefox.<p>Or should firefox charge a fee for each user? it is crazy, even so when the alternative is already existent and open standard.<p>what is even crazier is that they demand a payment, for a spec which only &quot;benefit&quot; over the open source code is that they can add DRM on top of it, so they can also charge the end user.",1383170509

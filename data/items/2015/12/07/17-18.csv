The metro system, in terms of station placement/spacing, schedules, line routes, etc., is designed to efficiently move people from the suburbs to the core and back again. It&#x27;s poorly laid out for moving people within the city; the hub and spoke layout means almost everyone needs to transfer and trips are often circuitous. For my commute to my last job, for example, getting to work via metro required walking five blocks, going into downtown, changing lines, coming back out from downtown, and walking an additional four blocks. It took 45 minutes, vs a half hour just to walk to work or ten minutes to bike, and this is typical of getting from place to place within the city by metro. Most people don&#x27;t bother.<p>The envisioned broader streetcar network would have been explicitly designed to address intra-urban trips, and would have had a very different layout from metro, with stations spaced more closely together, and fewer lines passing through downtown.<p>Lots of cities have different systems to address these needs, since it&#x27;s difficult or impossible to design a system that does both well.",1449511055

D3 is sort of the best of the jQuery-inspired &quot;select and mutate&quot; generation - it does data binding in a way that really makes sense as long as you let it handle DOM operations.<p>But following React, there&#x27;s been a pretty big movement away from procedural DOM manipulation and toward the declarative re-rendery &quot;DOM as a pure function of state&quot; approach.  In that case, letting D3 mess with the DOM (especially in the way that it does, where complex links between DOM and data are maintained in the background) is bad news.<p>If you already have a way of getting elements in and out of the DOM and keeping their state aligned with the data that you like better than the select-and-mutate model, a lot of what D3 does seems unnecessary or introduces problematic interference.  React and D3, for instance, tend to not play very nice without a lot of effort.<p>I&#x27;ve had projects where programmers lean on D3 because that&#x27;s the way they&#x27;ve learned to get SVG elements into the DOM - they&#x27;ll take an example they&#x27;ve found somewhere that mostly only uses simple shapes, modify it a little bit to do what they want and ask me for help adding that visualization into another project.  Sometimes in these cases, D3 isn&#x27;t getting used for much except for &quot;insert an svg element with these attributes for every node in this data structure&quot;, in which case it&#x27;s total overkill, and I end up stripping it out entirely.  I sometimes end up keeping it around for things (I&#x27;m probably not going to write my own Reingold-Tilford tree layout algorithm), but often in these cases I have to do extra work to keep it from conflicting with other things.",1449510428

So the cops circulated a vague description of an average-height, average-weight, typically-dressed Bostonian male as a suspect for a nonexistent crime.<p>The Internet Tough Guys aside, the author did make a mistake in answering police questions.  It should have gone something like this:<p><pre><code>  Cop: Hey my man.\n  SL: Yes?\n  Cop: Where are you coming from?\n  SL: Am I free to go?\n  Cop: No.\n  SL: Am I under arrest?\n  Cop: Not yet.\n  SL: Why am I being detained?\n  Cop: We had someone matching your description just try to break into a woman’s house.\n  SL: [remains silent]\n  Cop: You fit the description: Black male, knit hat, puffy coat.  Do you have identification?\n  SL: My name is Steve Locke.  I live at XXXXX, in Dedham.\n  Cop: No, no, no, do you have a photo ID card?\n  SL: I do not consent to searches or seizures.  I will not answer further questions without the assistance of legal counsel.\n</code></pre>\nAt this point, he gets arrested, not for breaking and entering, but for &quot;contempt of cop&quot;--probably even &quot;failure to identify&quot;.  He beats the rap, but does not beat the ride.  He later sues the city, and eventually accepts a $75000 settlement, which isn&#x27;t bad for enduring one <i>very</i> stressful day and some PTSD.<p>The bystanders made a mistake in not whipping out their cameras to film the incident.<p>But that ideal conversation does not happen when you are dropped into a stressful situation with no notice.  While you&#x27;re thinking about burritos, an armed man confronts you and informs you that you are a suspect in a crime.  Instead of thinking about how to resist police corruption, you&#x27;re thinking about not getting killed in the next ten minutes.

10691053,comment,10687375,10688681,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"groper is better in several ways. First off, you specify all your options in Python, not a DSL that won&#x27;t be checked until compile time. I mean, sure you could add code highlighting for docopt to your editor of choice, but chances are it already supports Python and works well.<p>Second, with groper each module is free to define its own options. You no longer need to have a centralized place where all the options are defined, and you don&#x27;t need to do the plumbing through your application to give the right values to the right modules. This way your server.py can say &quot;I want a host and a port&quot; and your logger.py can say &quot;I want the verbosity level and the filename&quot; and the two don&#x27;t have to know about each other (but can).<p>Third and most important, groper supports config files, which no other argument parser does. Chances are that if you are creating something more than just a simple command line program, you&#x27;d have too many options to specify on the command line. Instead, it&#x27;d be lovely to have a config file, and be able to override some of the options via command line args. Python&#x27;s ConfigParser is a mess, and it&#x27;s a mess that works completely differently from argparse/optparse/getopt. I also don&#x27;t consider something like config.py to be good practice either.<p>So basically, groper is your one stop shop for getting config files and command line options right. Oh, and it can generate sample config files for you if you want.",1449510156
10691052,comment,10686462,10689913,0,0,relkor,,,"> Does everything need to be skill building and development oriented?<p>In short yes. There is a finite amout of time before you die, and that time is measured in years, not millenia . We spend ~12 years in school playing &quot;general education&quot; where basically we are conditioned to set times for work and hierchael authority. That is 15% of your entire expected lifespan, aka not time to spent lightly. Look at how quickly you learn new job skills and keep up with new technologies. Then look back at public school. Why does it take 12 years to move from addition to calculus? Why does it take 11 years to teach kids that chemistry is between atoms and to learn simple reactions are building blocks? Right now the amount of education that public school provides is laughable compared to how much you learn in a year on the job.<p>What would it be like if you only took 8 years to get through primary and secondary? That is 10% more time added to your productive shelf life. Better yet, those years have been saved on the front end, where your brain is most agile and plastic.<p>My personal feeling is that there is a lot of time wasted in the current public education model. When I was in school, I never percieved any A/B testing, or relentless optimization of coursework. Instead everything was the same as it had been 10-20 years ago. At least now I get the sense that now people are starting to look for a better local minimum in the process of knowledge transfer.",1449510150

They have to check.</i><p>No, no they don&#x27;t. Goodness.<p>Let me break down this problem for you. Maybe a quarter of Boston is black, half of those are men, the height/weight thing probably doesn&#x27;t rule out more than half the people (and the police clearly admit in this interaction that it&#x27;s a stretch to say he&#x27;s that light-weight). At least 10% of men will go out with a knit cap on a cold Boston day. You multiply those together and you get 0.00625. You, and the police officers, together are thinking, &quot;man, that&#x27;s a surprisingly low probability, only an 0.625% chance that we&#x27;d come across a guy matching that description! We&#x27;d better detain him!&quot;<p>But that&#x27;s a dangerous fallacy, in a family called the <i>false positive paradoxes</i>. Usually we surprise kids in statistics class with these by saying, &quot;hey, you live in New York and took a 99%-accurate test for HIV and it came out positive, what&#x27;s the chance that you actually have HIV?&quot; And they answer 99%. But the real answer is, you probably don&#x27;t have it, and the probability is closer to one in three. How can this be? Well, you can look up these statistics for 2012, where there are 130,000 cases of HIV/AIDS in New York, which has nearly 20 million people, so your prior probability of having an HIV infection is only something like 0.65%; then the 1% false positive rate means that your 99%-accurate test has only increased your probability of actually having an HIV infection to about 39%, as the false positive set is larger than the true positive set.<p>It&#x27;s even worse in this case, where you&#x27;re looking for <i>one person</i>. Your 0.625% chance is spread out over a city of 650,000, meaning that over 4,000 people are subsumed by this description. Given all of the facts cited there is a less-than-0.025% chance that the guy they are detaining has done anything wrong.<p>Imagine the absurdity if they actually worked out and then quoted the statistics: &quot;Look, we&#x27;re 99.98% sure that you&#x27;re not the guy we&#x27;re looking for, but we&#x27;re detaining you anyway, because we demand <i>six nines</i> of certainty that you&#x27;re not who we&#x27;re looking for. Oh, you have a valid photo ID and we can easily check that someone with that name is a professor at this college? Roots in the community? Well, that only bumps you up to about 99.999% sure that you&#x27;re not the person we&#x27;re looking for, but that&#x27;s only <i>five nines</i>, buddy, not enough for us to let you go about your business. We&#x27;ve got to get the woman who made a complaint to look at your face to make absolutely sure that you&#x27;re not the criminal who we think you might with 0.001% chance be.&quot;<p>They absolutely do not <i>have to check</i> that.

You get <i>this</i> particular sack of beans from this tiny coffee producer in the middle of nowhere and you&#x27;ve roasted 5lbs of it just <i>so</i> and you then grind it just <i>so</i> and you then prepare it just <i>so</i> with an exacting process and carefully controlling your variables of time of extraction and water temp.<p>Starbucks cannot and does possess the ability to harness that subtlety because they operate on a huge scale. They roast their beans to burnt in order to drive <i>out</i> the differences between beans sourced at different plantations because they have to offer a homogenized product across all of their stores and all of their retail offerings. Every cup of coffee at every Starbucks across the entire world has to taste exactly the same because that&#x27;s what customers expect[0].<p>If I want nuance I go to a local coffee roaster and ask the owner what&#x27;s good that day. If I just want a caffeine fix I can go to Starbucks or, better yet, just drink the crappy stuff at work that&#x27;s free and load up on the sugar and cream.<p>I don&#x27;t go to a college rager and expect to find Springbank (fancy single-source Scotch); I go and expect to find Natty Light and Yuengling and, in fact, I <i>expect</i> those offerings because I&#x27;m not going to stand around and compare tasting notes, I&#x27;m going to get drunk and have a good time. Similarly, I go to Starbucks as a mid-morning break at work so I can have an excuse to get up and walk around and get something caffeinated I can sip at my desk while doing other things; I&#x27;m not expecting the <i>coffee experience</i> nor do I want it, I just want to get my buzz on and go about my day.<p>Additionally I think this move by Starbucks is putting even more pressure on small boutique coffee shops and potentially marginalizing them even further because now casual consumers can just go to Starbucks and get what they think is a &quot;boutique experience&quot; when, in fact, their money and their time would be better spent going to the actual boutique coffee shop (Edit- amyjess pointed out that this is NOT the case! <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/hey_wait_a_minute/2007/12/dont_fear_starbucks.single.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/hey_wait_a_m...</a>).

The NoMA station cost over $100 million, and was an above-ground infill station that required no new track. That was just the cost to build a new station.  The Potomac Yard station in Virginia is budgeted in the $210-$270 million range, and is also infill and above ground, but will require a slight track rerouting.  An H Street station, if it were even possible (and I&#x27;m skeptical because the whole area is riddled with other rail infrastructure) would involve new underground track through newly bored tunnels, and a new underground station. I bet $200 million is off by at least a factor of two.<p>Secondly, even if the city did want to spend the money on it, they wouldn&#x27;t be able to. DC can&#x27;t unilaterally spend money on Metro; all new construction has to be divided amongst eight different jurisdictions according to a legislatively pre-determined formula, and the WMATA board (which has representatives from all the jurisdictions on it) has to vote to approve it. This basically never happens for new construction in the city, because DC is a minority on the board and none of the suburban jurisdictions want to pay for core infrastructure, only extensions. DC has taken to replicating more and more of WMATA&#x27;s services under its DOT umbrella just to avoid having to deal with the bureaucratic nightmare and mismanagement of the transit authority. The (wildly successful) Circulator bus system is an example of this, as it in some cases directly overlaps with WMATA bus service. The streetcar would have been another such attempt.<p>Third: if by some miracle DC <i>could</i> get agreement on justifying new underground metrorail construction and pull the funding together for it, H St. would be nowhere near the top of the list of priorities. Metro has major rush-hour capacity issues that are in dire need of addressing, and a random spur out to H St. wouldn&#x27;t help with any of them. New construction should go towards an additional Potomac crossing north of Rosslyn, and a separated Blue line running north of the current blue/orange/silver shared track. This has been proposed to run along M, and could conceivably eventually serve Georgetown, Logan circle, and Union station.<p>(None of this is to say the streetcar project isn&#x27;t a clusterfuck. It is. WMATA just isn&#x27;t the answer.)",1449509772

Democracy requires peace to flourish, without it people are going to value strongman leadership. Europe has only very recently shook off the threat of war. Nobody expects another great war, but it still takes a few hundred years before democratic institutions become robust enough to resist all the different ways the area can slide back into tyranny. Europe is not yet one polity, but they&#x27;re moving in that direction.<p>Once people start thinking of themselves as European first, and French / German / Italian / etc. second, that&#x27;s when you know Europe is really ready for democracy. It takes a while. It wasn&#x27;t that long ago that United States citizens thought of themselves as citizens of their state first, then of the Union, the civil war cured us of that defect.<p>Perhaps Europe needs one more war to draw them together.

If the teachings of the Bible (or the Quran) are bound to a specific context then they shouldn&#x27;t be worshiped like some universal and perfect teachings. Following these teachings then means following moral values that were only valid 2000 or 1300 years ago, in a specific context. Obviously one cannot live in a modern society while following the Bible or the Koran to the letter. While (most) Christians acknowledge that fact, irregardless of their beliefs in a creator, that&#x27;s not the case of every religious group.<p>That&#x27;s basically my problem with religion. It&#x27;s a travesty, it exploits the need for spirituality every man has by trying to impose some random moral values dictated by a &quot;superior being&quot; nobody but a prophet has access to, without even trying to satisfy that need for spirituality at first place (since we know nothing about that being except the fact that he is &quot;our creator&quot;). And since men are not omniscient of course these moral values are bound to the context in which they were chosen.

That is, when constructing a list using multiple lines (which is where the trailing comma is most problematic), the first line is not prefixed with a comma, and all subsequent lines are.<p>E.g.<p><pre><code>    var foo = [\n      &quot;aa&quot;\n      , &quot;bb&quot;\n      , &quot;cc&quot;\n    ];\n</code></pre>\nThe usefulness of this may not be readily apparent in this simplistic example, but when the term is complex or spans multiple lines, it becomes useful both as an indicator of a new term starting, and in that identifying the end of a large term often isn&#x27;t nearly as easy as identifying that start.<p>E.g.<p><pre><code>    var foo = {\n      attr1: &quot;foo&quot;\n      , attr2: &quot;bar&quot;\n      , method1: function() {\n      }\n      , method2: function() {\n      }\n    };\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ll admit I don&#x27;t often use this technique.  Most commonly it is with large custom SQL queries, which themselves are fairly uncommon for me.  That said, SQL often lacks the mitigating techniques that make this less useful in common programming languages (such as computing complex terms ahead of time and assigning the result, gradual building of data structures, etc.).",1449508815

Even coordinated (non-automated) remote mapping attracts considerable criticism these days -- most ludicrously, by people suggesting that it&#x27;s better to leave an area unmapped so that it might one day attract local mappers (rather than remote contributors who will work on it immediately).<p>There&#x27;s also the question of the license. Without opening a can of worms about the usefulness of sharealike provisions in general, I think it&#x27;s safe to say that making a geocoding result trigger sharealike implications in a database is clearly problematic (consider geocoding a database of customer addresses, then being obliged to share the rest of the table!). Unfortunately OSM hasn&#x27;t yet reached agreement on a geocoding guidance. Consequently a couple dozen of us working on OpenAddresses have gotten the project to over 200 million addresses in less than 2 years. OSM is now a decade old, has millions of registered mappers, and contains less than 60 million addresses.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to be all doom and gloom, though.

10690706,comment,10686732,10690037,0,0,jevgeni,,,"My problem with the &quot;finite growth&quot; narrative I see often, is the fact that they always assume that growth is strictly a function of natural, material resources. To paint a caricature: they almost seem to say &quot;We had 100 people and 50 ingots of iron and we produced 200 forks and 30 novels. If we&#x27;d have 50 people and 25 ingots of iron, we&#x27;d only produce 100 forks and 15 novels.&quot; Which is retarded. One of the main (if not THE main) factors of growth is scientific progress - something that is mostly immaterial. The whole Internet revolution was made possible using machines that don&#x27;t exactly run on steam and copious amount of coal.<p>We are constantly learning to make more with less.<p>Until the finite growth theories start incorporating this notion, I will not treat them seriously.<p>The other problem I have with these theories, is that they tend to draw very weird and bolshevist crowd who want to start redistributing wealth, rationing out food, and breeding a &quot;stable population&quot; as soon as possible.",1449507747

In business, the teaching, listening, and understanding are communication between people with similar baud rates. My impression is that you may be projecting your experiences with groups of competent engineers -- who all passed a rigorous screening process and years of performance reviews -- onto the behavior of children drawn at random from the entire population.<p>Group projects are a tool to adjust the average performance, without any effort on the teacher&#x27;s part. The effect is more insidious than a simple numerical average would suggest because group projects introduce a time differential. Consider people as an op-amp. Their internal drive to produce a given quality is the reference voltage. What output the currently have (the progess towards the objective) is the input. When you put top performers in a group to pull up the slackers, the feedback gain of that system is artificially reduced. The good students want a certain level of quality, so they will work even harder to try an bring the quality (input signal) up to their standards. Depending on how bad the slackers are, the good student may even reach saturation, running out of hours in the day to compensate for the incompetence of others.<p>The incompetent teachers intuitively understand this effect. They are not fostering some kind of social nirvana, they are transferring the workload of pulling up the class average onto the bright kids. The bright kid ends up spending twice, three times as long on the group assignment, and that effort gets averaged out to the other group members&#x27; grades. The cost to top performers is all that time they could have been improving, moving forward, was stuck doing large amounts of low skill work.",1449507719

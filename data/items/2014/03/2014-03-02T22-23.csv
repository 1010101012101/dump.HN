I struggled with this when I was doing some CoreGraphics, I just couldn&#x27;t get a line to not &quot;blur&quot; when it should have been crisp.  The problem was exactly what you&#x27;re pointing out.<p>FWIW, I side on the NIB/Storyboard if your UI is even remotely complicated (sort of the opposite of what the article is saying).  Having to nudge a ton of controls around in code is a huge PITA and time saved using NIBs and Storyboards (properly).",1393801091
7331137,comment,7330683,7330683,4,0,SimianLogic2,,,"If all of your layouts are created in code, every visual tweak requires an engineer. In general I will do almost anything to NOT have to lay out views by hand, as nothing slows a project down more than jumping into the tweak-a-magic-number-and-recompile cycle. It sucked when I was doing CSS, and it sucks even more when I&#x27;m compiling code.<p>For the most part IB mostly doesn&#x27;t make sense for games, so I have a custom Photoshop script that exports each layer with metadata. A custom importer reads the metadata file and loads the whole view in the proper positioning. So I&#x27;ve basically swapped IB for Photoshop, but the work flow is essentially the same....",1393801084
7331136,comment,7327600,7329826,1,0,jmccree,,,"As I mentioned to the other poster, off duty officers here (and many/most places) work in their department issued uniform with their badge/radio/gun with full police powers/immunity. Besides neighborhood patrols, another common use is parking garages or high end shopping centers hiring officers to stop traffic to let people in/out of their location on busy streets. It&#x27;s not just ATL, NYPD paid detail unit supplies off duty in unform officers with dept insurance. Many police department websites even have online forms to fill out if you want to hire officer/s with standard rates.<p>I believe there are a few states/jurisdictions that restrict off duty officers from working in uniform w/police power, but that&#x27;s probably a minority. With budgets being cut everywhere, officers being able to earn an extra 50% or more of their normal salary working off duty gigs is a &quot;free benefit&quot; the department can offer, or like in NYC where the NYPD charges a 10% admin fee ($1.18m earned in 2011) it&#x27;s extra income for the dept.<p>For example, if Facebook was located in San Jose, they could just pay $46.50/hr for as many officers as they wanted, in unform, per <a href=""http://www.sjpd.org/PDF_Forms/SEU_Secondary_Employment_Employer_Application.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sjpd.org/PDF_Forms/SEU_Secondary_Employment_Emplo...</a> .",1393801066

There is no easy way in the browser settings to select your own stylesheet.  Also there is no easy way to just turn off the author&#x27;s stylesheet.  Doing so can be quite useful for troublesome sites.  In Firefox it&#x27;s View -> Page Style -> None.  But even that&#x27;s obtuse.  Not being able to easily flip between stylesheets in the browsers - has meant that author&#x27;s can&#x27;t really be bothered to supply them.  Having some free well rounded Core styles, that users can apply to any site would be a nice to have feature in the browser, or alternatively making it very simple to add your own.<p>Opera is the only browser that felt like it let me apply my own stylesheet.  Other browers behave inconsistantyl when adding my own.  Even Firefox is odd.  My compromise is just to specify foreground and background colours, with a larger font size, and an easy to read font.  That way the layouts don&#x27;t get that borked.  Reading a well designed page with logical flow off can read quite well, if you apply your own styles, or use your desktops.",1393800787

I work on Whonix and am excited that you&#x27;re commenting on it.<p>A minimum Debian is grml [1], 150-350MB, which Whonix uses as a base.<p>But by the time we&#x27;re done adding packages and KDE, it&#x27;s not minimal anymore. We use a popular GNU/Linux distro (instead of, say, hardened gentoo) because 1) Lots of eyes on a bigger project is more secure than few eyes on a smaller project, and 2) Bad or missing usability/UX hurts security: these systems are used by journalists and dissidents, not the Unix and computer security trained. The trick is making a system that moderately educated users can get work done on, without letting them shoot themselves in the foot.<p>VMs have their problems, but VirtualBox inside an average Windows install is harder to exploit than an average Windows install alone. Whonix can also run on dedicated hardware or inside a dedicated/minimal/portable host OS. Running inside QubesOS, the Xen-based (everything is isolated) security focused desktop OS, is a mid-term goal.<p>Additionally, as resources (that is, volunteers) grow, builds of Whonix based on other distros/desktops/hardware will appear. To see you post on our forum [2] or github issues [3], lending your experience with PORTAL, would be a dream! Let&#x27;s talk stream isolation. Or just voice your concerns and we&#x27;ll try to defend our choices.<p>---<p>Ditto on Pond, which is weird since Appelbaum is behind it, but apparently they don&#x27;t want to start from scratch (Pond was just a README last time I checked).<p>I have big hopes for TIMB, BitMessage, and the new (crossplatform) TextSecure. Hopefully redphone will receive the same treatment as TextSecure. Me and the lead Whonix developer tried to set up a crossplatform secure voice chat over Jitsi... an hour later we gave up.<p>Icebird + TorBirdy is just barely becoming a reality. A GPG capable email client that doesn&#x27;t give away your time zone is big news in this world. Don&#x27;t get me started on losing all your bookmarks when you update the tor browser bundle!

For example, iPhoto on iPad uses NIBs to load in UI interface assets as it&#x27;s more convenient than doing it in code - and this is an app with a large development team and a significant codebase (there&#x27;s an interesting WWDC 2012 video available on iPhoto&#x27;s iOS architecture, which is where I got this piece of trivia from).<p>One of the problems with storyboards - versus NIBs - is that it can become difficult to work at scale. Not scale in terms of team members (although that can be a problem), but scale in terms of the size of your app&#x27;s UI. A iPad app with a a dozen different screens of content can become very hard to navigate.<p>Where storyboards <i>are</i> useful is allowing those new to the platform to get up to speed on concepts such as custom table view cells, collection views, auto layout and the like without having to get bogged down in the large amount of code this would normally require. They&#x27;re definitely not for everyone.<p>Sadly, NIBs have a bit of a bad reputation with some developers. I suspect this is mainly for historical reasons - as of Xcode 5 the XML schema has been significantly simplified making code review and source control much easier, and NIBs have significant advantages for newer technologies such as auto layout.",1393799281

Of course this applies to literal machines, like when a website asks you if you&#x27;re 18. But what about machines that are made up of people? E.g. if the Nazis come to ask you if you have any jews in your attic, are you ethically obligated to tell the truth if it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that what happens from there is determined entirely programmatically, even if those programs are executed by people? These questions are especially important given the massive power imbalances between ordinary people and machines, be they technological, corporate, or political.<p>I think the lesson for the modern world may be that perhaps we need to teach our kids both to recognize the humanity of others more, but paradoxically also to deny the humanity of other more.",1393799139

Giving Bitcoin a political flavor does it a disservice.<p>Personally, I think that financial regulation is a great tool in the service of freedom. For example, before financial regulation in the US gained its teeth, most of the population was under the thumb of a small group of some very unscrupulous individuals (those who came to be called the Robber Barons). It was regulation that freed America from those people. Also, I think that human beings, by virtue of their biological and psychological construction, are prone to be subjugated to some substances as well as some ideas. What is freedom, then: allowing people to fall into slavery if they so wish it or preventing them?<p>I&#x27;m not saying my views are right and yours are wrong.

(Full disclosure, I helped write Auto Layout.)<p>One advantage is that it makes sure things are pixel-integral, no matter the scale factor of the screen. For example, his code example,<p>button.x = self.view.width  * 0.2; // Position the inset at 20% of the width.<p>has a pretty good chance at starting the button at x=21.845, or some other point in-between pixels and producing a blurry line. If you do this same relation in Auto Layout, the engine makes sure that the positions and widths are all pixel-integral.<p>This is not as simple as just rounding everything, either! For example, if you have two views<p>[blue][red], you want to make sure you round their shared edge either to the left or to the right. Otherwise, there will be a gap between them. You need to make sure you round their shared edge the same way consistently too, or it will jump back and forth as you resize a window and produce a noticeable jitter.<p>Also, in that same code example, they set a button&#x27;s x position to be directly related to the width of a view. If you ever want to support RTL interfaces, this is a bad idea. It is relating a width to a position. In a RTL interface, the correct code would be<p>button.x = self.view.width - self.view.width * 0.2 - button.width<p>Complicated! In general, you shouldn&#x27;t convert between positions and sizes. Instead, I would make an invisible spacer view and lay them out like this using the layout format language<p>|[spacerView][button]<p>Then make a relation setting the spacerView&#x27;s width to be 0.2 of the superview&#x27;s width.

I couldn&#x27;t fully penetrate a lot of the marketing BS on some of these sites so it wasn&#x27;t clear what was &quot;free&quot; and if it required a GUI client or some other thing capable of serving ads or whether the ads were just on their site or what.",1393797746

This is a mistake that is <i>very</i> common among iOS engineers. Anything dealing with subviews, layouts, touches, etc should go into subclasses of UIView; view controllers should handle touches (delegation!), interact with the navigation controller, and act as a bridge between your views and the rest of your application code.",1393797674

But the nix/open other bubbles are where programmers have to know more, be more manual and be more independent.  It is more of a street knowledge type game where the Microsoft bubble is the scheduled childhood. On the extreme, developers in Microsoft bubbles (or other bubbles for that matter Rails, Node.js) are like cults/religions.<p>There are good and bad sides to this type of approach to developers on a platform. They&#x27;ll constantly look to Microsoft for solutions rather than independent open source ones (changing a bit but only recently). It is easy to see why companies like using this tech.<p>Now with overlay attached or strict parents, sometimes the kids when they see the real world, they run for the hills.",1393797665

Figuring out what's best is a very hard problem, of course, but it's a problem worth trying to solve, rather than giving up and going for the next best thing, which is prestige. Plato and Aristotle are good examples, because reading them is a waste of time (but very prestigious).

Even today, any time I search in Japanese, google seems to provide much less useful results.",1219582610

Also the myth was busted properly in  mythbusters season 5, ""seven folds"":<p>""They decided to make their open big 170' x 220' piece using 17 rolls of paper joined together with double-sided tape. An experiment this large required that they go to Moffett Field and setup in one of the blimp hangers there.<p>Using the traditional technique of alternating folds length and width-wise, they were able to get eleven folds.""<p><a href=""http://kwc.org/mythbusters/2007/01/episode_72_underwater_car_and.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kwc.org/mythbusters/2007/01/episode_72_underwater_car...</a>",1219582478
285128,comment,284925,284925,0,0,vitaminj,,,"I read Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Flies and To Kill a Mockingbird years after I finished school. I'm by no means a literary snob and read all sorts of fiction (except I haven't gotten around to Harry Potter yet), but there's a reason why these books are taught in school over say Dan Brown... they're damn good. Especially without the burden of school assessment.<p>I think back to the books that I did read at school, like Conrad's Heart of Darkness and Fitzgerald's Gatsby, and I can instantly see the quality in those works. Same goes for ""classics"" I've read in recent years, like Marquez, Camus, Frank Herbert, Huxley, etc.<p>That said, there have been some classics I've found tiresome. I've never been able to finish a Dostoyevsky book, and Kafka was hard going without being very fulfilling. But in general, the classics are really fucking good.",1219582440

Here is my point: Would you rather read Plato, Aristotle, and the like, or the writings of a more ""modern"" philosopher who had conceivably based his opinions on all three?<p>And yes, using word timeless twice in my original post does make the argument appear circular. Works are not timeless because they are timeless (circular indeed!) but because their themes are timeless AND they were the first to thoroughly explore those themes.",1219579518

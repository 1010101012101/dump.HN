Simply put, it is just wishful thinking.<p>Regardless, Penrose himself dismisses the role of any supernatural factors; this leaves us open to the possibility that a non-algorithic but nevertheless synthetic intelligence could be created (and in theory wedged into my roomba).

4067663,comment,4067297,4067297,3,0,gojomo,,,"The FB IPO sends a signal that certain exits are about 35% less lucrative than the most enthusiastic might have thought. And, the IPO wasn't the 'starter pistol' for another frenzy. I think the memory of 12 years ago hasn't faded entirely yet, and there's so much other uncertainty in the economic world no one can be a runaway optimist.<p>But the IPO results might actually boost certain kinds of deals. For example, would you rather sell your company to FB for $X million of FB stock when that stock is at 45 or when it's at 26? (Of course X is larger when FB is flush, but I doubt X goes down linearly with FB market-cap when there are other bidders. And psychologically, it may be easier to think FB grows 50% back into its peak, than 50% more above its peak.)<p>If there had been an indiscriminate frenzy, everyone knows that ends in a crash. When everyone's instead been reminded that companies are different -- FB isn't GPRN isn't AAPL isn't LNKD -- and the particulars of value and model matter, that's better for a sustained boom at a more measured pace.",1338879130

In all cases, the ""beautification"" of the product happens after the underlying principles, data structures, circuit fundamentals, loads, thermal requirements, etc. are well understood and have gone through many prototyping and testing phases.  I am not talking about minimum-viable-product stuff here.<p>Yes, if the goal is a minimum-viable-product type web solution, by all means, make it pretty and fake the rest until you see enough traction to figure out if there's a real business.<p>For nearly anything else, the internals need to be well understood before it makes sense to do anything else.  I can't think of one mechanical design I've done where I spent a ton of time figuring out color, size, shape and location of buttons and knobs before fully understanding what needed to go inside the box, what the electronics was going to look like, communications protocols, power supply requirements, environmental requirements, etc.<p>So, yes, if I was going to design a car I'd start by selecting an engine, drive train and suspension components and then designing the of the vehicle rest around it.  You'd fit artists concepts and renderings to the realities of the underlying mechanics.  It then becomes an iterative process where you push and pull and make adjustments to both the artistic expression and the technical realities of the design in order to converge on a product that can be released.<p>Let me state the obvious:  These analogies are all imperfect.",1338879116

Your next step is to hire someone to develop business and manage relationships. You need a COO or president. Of course, you will then be expected to provide a great deal of leadership and vision, but you might have time to code again.<p>2, 3) Accomplishment may elude you until you build a product if that's what you really want to do. Best advice is to treat it like a client and find room for it.<p>4. Again, this points to your wanting a product. There's no way to get non-linear with a consultancy. Even a fat retainer is linear because staff has to service it (or it's so automated it's basically a product.) Also, as you keep growing you'll be able to choose better projects.<p>5. In general, or is this the project again? Regardless this is a good reason to start trying to land a good COO who is passionate.<p>As you can tell, I believe you are giving up too easily, and I think you should press forward to remove the business side of service consulting from your daily work by removing yourself from the daily business development work, and removing service consulting from your company's work by developing products. Hope it goes well.<p>2.",1338878985

For us we have the following issues: a) the raid degrades; on EVERY SINGLE MACHINE; we have, per machine, 1 degrade every month, meaning that for 2-3 days of the month the machine is unusable. We asked support; they have no clue as to the why and they always fix it, but it takes 2-3 days because everything will be very slow while it's resynching. b) we have rather a lot of network issues; the network just disappears for minutes to an hour. Now the other people on HN might not notice all of this as they have no (or no good) monitoring and they don't check their sites often enough; generally, for a blog or whatever you won't notice the downtime; if your server is not busy you won't notice the resync and if you don't have monitoring odds are you won't notice that ~1 hour / month network issue. But we really hammer hard (there were 2 very popular sites hosted on a cluster of them) on our servers and they were serving millions of hits/day. People notice then that suddenly the ENTIRE cluster is gone for a time. And when a machine doing 100s of hits/sec and goes into resync, you'll notice. So we are only running analytics there. And for the price/power it's a really good deal; hard to beat.<p>Also; they are HUGE and growing fast. When I started with them in 2005, they would ONLY speak french, you could not ask for support in another language, you could not pay in another way than the french bank and so forth. And machines + network would be down often. They improved a lot, so my guess is they will improve more over time, but they are a monster in hosting land.",1338878449

What startups really need most is cheap stuff, not good code, not cutting edge technology, not even smart employees. What every startup is after might be some cheap hosting, it might be cheap food, but most of all, it's just cheap programmers. They'll probably try (and sometimes succeed) luring you in with their promises of innovation, freedom and an altogether ""informal"" working environment.
It all sounds so cool and so much fun... Who could resist? The prospect of changing the world, of making a difference is attractive to any self respecting geek. But herein lies the problem: the people you'll be working for not only are non-technical, they are cheap and totally convinced that their idea is worth more than all the sleepless nights you'll spend; first trying to make them realize how mistaken they are, and then, once this has proven useless, simply doing what they ask of you and hoping that their repeated failures will give them a hint. 
You'll be expected to be available around the clock, during weekends and holidays (failing to do so will result in your bosses letting you know just how aggravated they are that you have some objections to becoming a slave). Your family will suffer, as will your social life. You, in the meantime, will be oblivious to all this, inmersed in the thrill of belonging to a startup. 
But one day, not so far off, you will wake up and realize that you've not only been wasting your life. You've also been selling yourself cheap.<p>If you really tink you belong in a startup, then maybe you should start your own. Just remember how narrowly you escaped becoming a victim of the startup fad. And spread the word. True nerds need an 'idea entrepreneur' as much as we need a plague.",1338877770

It's equal parts optimistic futurism and steadfast abhorrence to change.<p>Walk down the streets, look inside City Hall - look at the extreme effort applied to make sure even the streetcars hail from the early 20th century, and that the sanctified Victorians are never touched, and you'd never guess this was a city looking to be at the forefront of massive economic and population growth.<p>Depending on where you are looking, rents in the city are up from 30% all the way to 130% since this time last year. And the city added a net total of a whopping 269 new housing units in 2011. Everyone has heard stories - entrepreneurs cashing out with Fuck You money, and can't buy a condo - because none are on sale, at any price. We've also heard the stories, of the hated dotcom yuppies going to view an apartment and bidding substantially above the already outrageous asking price. It's getting a little crazy out there.<p>All the while the city has placed firm caps on the amount of new commercial space that may be developed per year. Worse yet, the city has placed restrictions even on <i>where</i> residential and commercial development can happen - pretty much exclusively in SoMa, which accounts for 0.8 square miles of the total 49 square miles of land in SF.<p>Meanwhile the other 45 square miles (minus the Presidio and Golden Gate Park) are full of low-density housing that is completely barred from building upwards to accommodate the massive influx of population. The 3-story Victorian House is holy, and must not be sullied by... well, more people living there, rents be damned.<p>And what's with using Twitter to recolonize crack row? Of all the businesses you can try to import to bring more ""desirable"" traffic to the area, you had to pick the one that caters all meals internally and has every imaginable perk already in-house? This is supposed to bring new businesses to the area? Not to mention the area's massive homelessness and drug abuse problem is not due to <i>lack</i> of legitimate business traffic, but rather the presence of numerous humanitarian aid organizations, none of whom are going to be moving any time soon (nor should they, nor would it be politically feasible to force them to).

At the time, they were about 12 employees.<p>I didn't realize it at the time, as it was my first time going through the interview/offer dance, but having much more experience with these things now (from both sides of the process), I can honestly say it ranks as the best I've ever heard of.<p>a) The technical portion of the interview was the best I've ever been through. It culminated in them asking me to set aside 4 hours to come into their office and work alongside them (asking questions if I needed to), writing an HTTP server in C.<p>I almost shat my pants when I heard the question, but to this day its the most rewarding technical interview of my life. I started off with a problem I wasn't sure I could sove in the allotted time, I _built_ something, and it _worked_. (Well, it mostly worked. There was one elusive bug I couldn't figure out that day. I had to leave because of another commitment, but I promised to come back the next day and fix it. When I got back the next day, a senior Meebo engineer had spent 3 hours debugging my code until he figured out the problem. We code reviewed my code line-by-line as a wrap-up to the interview.)<p>b) The non-technical portion of the interview was the best I've ever been through. They were very concerned about the ever-elusive ""culture fit"", and the entire team made an effort to get to know me, taking me out to meals, etc. I met all three of the co-founders (Seth, Elaine, and Sandy), all of whom I'm sure were busy trying to build a product and grow a company, but they were incredibly warm, genuinely interested in getting to know me, and generous with their time.<p>c) They gave me a great offer. For a fresh-out-of-college student with not much real work experience, both the salary and the equity portions of my offer were extremely generous. I didn't even have to negotiate. At the time, Seth explained they didn't want to go through a contentious negotiation process, so they were opening off with a generous offer and it wasn't really open to negotiation. It was, indeed, a generous offer. (Five years of experience later, and I'm making less money, adjusted for inflation, than Meebo offered me as a fresh-out-of-school untried new hire.)<p>d) The post-offer process was the best I've been through. At the time, I knew nothing about startups, stock options, VC, etc. I didn't even know how much I didn't know. At his own initiative, Seth (the CEO!), took the time to explain the equity portion of my offer. The offer included a number of options and a strike price (standard), but unprompted told me about the other numbers I should be concerned with: total shares outstanding, fully diluted % stake, preference multiples, etc. There's much more transparency about this stuff today (blogs, etc), but at the time no one else explained this stuff to you (and as a stupid college student, you wouldn't know to ask). Even today, in a much more competitive hiring environment, I hear about companies that tell experienced engineers (who know what they're negotiating) that certain numbers which are essential to understanding an equity offer (like total number of shares outstanding) are ""confidential"".<p>I ended up turning down the offer, but I have enormous admiration and respect for Seth, Sandy, Elaine, and the whole team at Meebo. Congratulations on your many successes over the years, and I hope to continue seeing great things from you in the future.",1338876866

I can't help feeling that the Facebooks and Twitters are using the web in a way that there really isn't a proper infrastructure for. They seem to be quite expensive to maintain and, by nature don't generate lots of money by what they do. In my opinion, if they charged they wouldn't be able to build the big networks of interconnected users that defines their value.<p>I think there are ways past this conundrum but I don't think that profit motive will be the what pushes them and I think they will require a somewhat different infrastructure than we have now.",1338876395

Nintendo chose to make their games more party and social oriented with the Wii and it led all consoles in sales until Microsoft came out with the Kinect. A social-focused console could become another hit in the era of Facebook.",1338876381

However, they can do nothing and wait for the deadline to come. If the price drops, they will buy a share to deliver the previous sell order, and make a new sell order at the same price to ""extend"" the delivery deadline.",1338876379

The only problem could be related to the fact that doing this kind of stack you're now dealing with one ""logical"" system so if the firmware is bugged or someone issues the wrong command, you can have a single point of failure (but this could happen also if an HA system goes wrong by itself or because of you)",1338876355

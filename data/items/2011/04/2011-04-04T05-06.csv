And there's not much you can do about that other than to actively drive users away from the site.  (Difficult captcha?  Erlang Fridays?

It isn't considered appropriate to downvote a comment unless it is overtly offensive or incorrect, so mediocre commenters don't receive signals when they are contributing almost nothing to the conversation.

There isn't an easy way to move up and the work is dull, but if you're looking to lead a new company or join a foundling company, you'll want to hone your skills at owning issues and solving them (did your entire ops team just quit? yes they did.

The largess of the GNU C compiler is the very definition of a black box.  If you're going to run off and do loads of systems programming, you're going to have to understand exactly how your black box works.  This is still very possible with C++, it's just a lot more complicated given the semantics of the language.<p>I think this back and forth sort of breaks down because people say things like C and C++ and it's not clear if they're talking about<p>1) The languages themselves.
2) The compilers
3) Possible runtimes and other overhead that need to be considered in a stereotypical environment (that is, probably not kernel coding).  It tweeks me every time we get into a language war, because a lot of the time the language itself isn't the real point of discussion, but rather it's some sideways way of referring to the toolchain that's popular at the given moment.  C++ as a language could very well be tooled to write a kernel, given a good compiler and a semantics that coders stick to (just like C).  I feel like the C++/HLL camps are crying for something other than C because they're not interested in the super low level details, but still would like to eek some functionality out of the kernel.  They're basically saying, ""we would prefer tools other than C"" (regardless of whether C++ is a worthwhile and better option, I am unconvinced).<p>I think an even more interesting conversation to have would be:  have operating systems kernels become TOO COMPLEX to code in (just) C/ASM?  Are we in over our heads?  Should we invest in the creation of better tools to handle such large, complex systems or is everything just fine?<p>DISCLAIMER: I actually don't like programming in C++.

A lot of schools offer a mix of motion graphics and graphic design as well.<p>Other schools you can consider are the unaccredited Art Institute, and Full Sail. I've heard nothing but bad things about the latter so I would avoid it. If your looking for strictly trade learning and no conceptual new media nonsense Ai might be good to consider. Keep in mind though that you won't be able to transfer credits earned there anywhere else.<p>If you aren't interested in unaccredited schools you should also check out your local community colleges offerings the credits you earn there  will transfer to private art colleges if you change your mind later and find one that you like.<p>Before applying for schools check and see whether or not they require a portfolio, I think a lot of the private art colleges do.

It eventually gets into why the Linux kernel isn't written in C++, but the beginning of the discussion starts with an innocent question about how to port a legacy kernel module that was written in C++ for 2.4 and no longer works with 2.6.<p>The OP is roundly criticized for even considering writing a kernel module in C++.  The authors of the module had to patch the Linux kernel heavily to make the headers compile as C++, and of course the patches for 2.4 don't all work for 2.6.<p>I can agree that if you patch the crap out of an open source project, be it the kernel or just a library, to make it work with your own code, then you get what you deserve when it gets out of sync with the upstream version and no longer is compatible.  How could it be otherwise?<p>But as an experienced C++ hacker I disagree with the argument the C hackers made in the discussion that ""you just can't use C++ there, you must use C"" (to paraphrase).<p>The problem isn't that they chose the ""wrong"" language, it's just that they interfaced the C++ code with the C (kernel) code incorrectly.  The Right Way would be to simply write a compatibility layer <i>in C</i> that calls functions in the C++ code.  And the C++ code could in turn call back to C functions in the compatibility layer when they need to interface with some kernel data structure.  Although performance is listed as an issue, they specifically say that their module gets its performance benefit by not having to copy packet data to user space.  They would still get this benefit, even if they had the minuscule extra time it takes to make a call through a C/C++ compatibility layer.",1301894453

This is not true of C++, which is why it is not the most suitable language to write kernel code in. Kernel software is so critical that it is not wise to cede control to a baroque compiler.

In an organization built around product-centric teams, it may be easier to release products more quickly and the average employee may perceive a smoother course from concept to execution, but the organization will quickly discover that horizontal changes become extremely difficult.  The frustrated product developer who can't get products out is replaced by the frustrated operations guy who can't patch unsecure systems fast enough.  Which one is worse?  For Google, I would say the latter.  While it always seems like a tragedy to hear about ""great"" products getting killed, pre-birth, in the corporate mill, I much prefer my stable, high uptime, browser-performant Google to a Google that releases way more product than it already does.<p>Not to mention that most products (like most startups) fail.  As a product-centric company, do you break teams apart after a product fails?  If a product succeeds, do you take that successful team and move it to the other product?  That may work if you're lucky enough to have a team with the proper skills balance (not to mention passion) to move across different products.  What about career goals?  People in a particular field tend to want to work with the best people in that field--a huge draw of working at Google is working with the best people in Field X.  In a functional organization, the functions (almost) never go away--so the teams are stable.<p>Of course, being on the outside I can't speak for the problems that are mentioned, such as in-fighting, lack of executive discipline (""You will not launch your product because I don't like your hair style, FUUUUUUUUU!""), etc., but those problems are bad regardless of organization type.",1301894012

However, something clearly isn't working in the education system for the majority of students today, hence all the talk of ""educational reform.""<p>Nobody will disagree that it takes work to learn, and I am by no means proposing that technology is a magic bullet that will make learning easy all of a sudden. All I am suggesting is that technology can help make aspects of learning easier in order to allow students to focus on the more difficult aspects.<p>Just like athletes wear specialized gear to reduce unnecessary pain, we can use technology to reduce unnecessary work in the education system and focus on the actual learning.",1301893922

While at University we had an exercise in my Comparative Politics class (I majored in Int'l Relations) in which we were provide with a description of a fictional country and asked to write a constitution that we felt would best unify the country and address all the political needs of the various demographics and social groups within the country.<p>What we learned from the experience is that it's the social structure of the country, its history and traditions, that are the driving factor behind how we, as a class, wrote the constitution.<p>In our case, the fictional country had various social groups of different sizes in tribal areas.  Each member of the group was assigned to one of the groups based on the group's size.<p>We developed a constitution quite similar to the U.S. constitution with a federal system, though I believe we used a proportional representation system rather than a winner-takes-all voting system like the U.S. and U.K. use.<p>In short, I don't think that modern technology would have a significant impact on how a constitution would be written because, as you said, it's all driven by human emotion, ambition, morality, and ethics.  While certain aspects of the implementation of a government may be different if modern technology were applied consistently, the overall structure, design, and operation of government would be still end up being a compromise of the various ideologies of the citizens (assuming a democracy, of course).",1301893591

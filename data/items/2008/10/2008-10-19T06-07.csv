The difficult part is making one that can survive when put into competition with other ideologies and still be benevolent.  Any survival of the fittest type selection will tend to favor nasty traits such as xenophobia.",1224399339

A company that has made layoffs is branded a loser, and it becomes very hard to get positive press, recruit new talent and close new rounds of financing. Until now that is. Companies that have made layoffs in the last week are generally being given a pat on the back for being financially prudent ...""</i><p>Think this will be the last round of layoffs?<p>Probably not. A salient point to remember about creating/joining companies with VC backing they become another layer of management dictating the terms when financial conditions are not in their favour. As for shedding the bottom 5% - trees do the same. Shed their leaves in a desperate bid to survive just before they die.",1224399061

Anyone who is trying to sell you one policy that would have fixed it ""it's all the government's fault!"", or ""if only we had had more regulation!"" (without saying what regulation) is very likely wrong.<p>Tyler Cowen, as he often does, has something sensible to say:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/19/business/19view.html?partner=permalink&exprod=permalink"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/19/business/19view.html?partn...</a>",1224398919

336945,comment,336876,336876,0,0,iigs,,,"Interesting that people are admitting it, but this has probably been true for longer than I've been paying attention (about a decade) -- it's generally recognized that the first cut is deadwood, especially if the number is low (like the quoted myspace 5%).<p>An often overlooked silver lining to this is that a person under-performing in a position often has as much to do with the position as the performer. The person will probably go on to find a better, happier, more productive, or higher paying job elsewhere. Failure of a person in a role has as much to do with the management that put them in the position as the guy who ended up there, <i>especially</i> when the employer is in bulk-up mode.",1224398311

203002,comment,202798,202977,0,0,zhyder,,,"Thanks!<p>1. I'm worried about database load. I'll have to do some intelligent memcaching etc. (haven't thought this thru yet) to make that a possibility.<p>2. Yep I've thought of that, tho I'm a little worried it might creep people out. (It's not as awesome as Gmail to get away with it.) That's one possible way of monetization, the other being the freemium model. But right now I just want to get some users, get the features right.<p>3. Hmmm... the library pane on the left kinda does that. Would you want it to work in a different way?<p>4. Sure. But I don't want to resize the canvas for UI reasons (see another of my comments on window resizing).<p>5. You can already create a library of shapes (the left pane). Did you mean something different?<p>6. I absolutely want to do something like that. But I've dreamed up a very different -and I think better- implementation. To build and sell a real physical product like that I'll need quite a bit of funding. PG, you there? :)<p>7. Yeah I was hoping to avoid that (see 4. above). Coz I hate having to constantly zoom in/out and pan around just to draw. But it may be needed if the current canvas just isn't big enough :(.",1212037152

What if a new language were created that either negated the need for arrays all together; or implemented core types that allow for complete creation of an array type in a library?",1212034311

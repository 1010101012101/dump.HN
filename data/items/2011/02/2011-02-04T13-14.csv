He's simply equating internet to electricity as if they were really similar things.<p>What he utterly fails to account for is the fact that the costs to provide a certain level of bandwidth have been dropping dramatically. You could simply be making regular, equal investments every year and that would be enough to see bandwidth rise in line with consumption. Yes, a 50% year-over-year increase in consumption is matched be a 50-60% year-over-year cost decrease.<p>Furthermore, Bell (for example) has little incentive to upgrade early and often if they can charge whatever they want. They can simply milk their creaky infrastructure until it breaks down (infrastructure that was heavily subsidized by the taxpayer), and then simply increase their rates to cover the costs of investments they should have made a long time ago if they didn't act according to perverse incentives.<p>From another angle, fast, ubiquitous, unlimited (for all intents-and-purposes) internet should be a policy objective for our government. Countries that have made heavy investment in internet infrastructure, like South Korea and Japan, are reaping the rewards. This will only become more important.<p>Canada also has THE most expensive internet access among OECD countries. Period. Full stop.<p>Finally, this ruling was about imposing UBB on 3rd-party providers, not about UBB in general. Teksavvy already had caps at 200GB and a more expensive plan that offered unlimited access, and as many people don't seem to understand, they're not using Bell's backhaul. They operate their own - they just need to access the last mile infrastructure because it's a bloody duopoly.<p>I could go on and on and on, but suffice it to say that David is just plain wrong here. It IS as one-sided as we think.",1296827882

This part was tricky for me. I love learning, and my approach for a long time was to just keep learning rather than doing. As soon as I would finish one programming book or tutorial series I'd start on another. If I ran across something new and interesting I would switch over to it. After a long time approach to doing that I realized I had a lot of half-baked knowledge and nothing to show for it.<p>Finally I buckled down and ""did."" I started by tackling a problem of my own - keeping focused, on task, and efficient. It has become a tangible project that I will (soon) be able to show a potential employer or even make money off of it. The best part is that it's something I personally believe in and need, so I'm passionate about it. Working on someone else's project sometimes makes it hard to get excited about what you're creating.<p>If you can't think of some problem of your own to solve, work on someone else's. The best approach I know of here is to find a local not-for-profit organization or charity. Ask them what could improve their ability to do whatever it is they do, or even help save them money and then create it. Give it to them free of charge. This a) gives you something tangible to show potential employers, b) could possibly be a tax write off, c) gives you real world ""pull"" experience, d) is for a good cause.<p>Some people might tell you that you should never do work for free. In this case, the work you're doing <i>is benefiting you</i>, even if there is no money involved. Besides, if it's for a good cause then there will be rewards - assuming you believe in God or karma :)<p>To reiterate edw519, adjust your attitude, find something to build, and do it.",1296827799

2179369,comment,2178439,2178439,0,0,rst,,,"Very odd to read, after the Android Market has been running for quite some time, that ""The result of [app store review] is that Apple can more easily let us use their payment system without scaring their lawyers, devaluing their store’s image, or incurring high fraud and chargeback fees from their payment processors.""<p>Google certainly has lawyers, and the (former) try-before-you-buy policy was a much more direct answer to fraud and chargeback than stringent app review.  As to reputation, the Android store's poor rep is more due to the absence of particular good apps (or the difficulty finding them) than the presence of crud (which Apple's store has in abundance) --- and I don't think you can credit the review process with attracting good developers.  Most of them hate it.<p>It's also funny that he doesn't mention the one thing that the review process <i>does</i> do for end users --- it makes sure that apps conform to Apple's UI guidelines.  They can be obnoxious about this, as in the flat rejection of camera apps that use the volume buttons as shutter controls, but the consistency is probably a net win for users overall.  Though for Android, manufacturer reskinning is probably a bigger problem.<p>But it's been used in directly anticompetitive ways (the Google Voice holdup, which let to an FCC investigation; the current Sony reader payments flap) that it's really hard to deny that that's one of the points of the exercise from Apple's perspective.

2179359,comment,2179123,2179263,0,0,chousuke,,,"I can't draw, but IMO git's basic operations are pretty easy to visualise if you think of the repository and commits as a graph (a tree). You start with the first commit/snapshot as the root, and every node after that is a child of the root. To bring diffs into this model, I suppose you could think of the edges as the ""diff"" between two snapshots; ie. how to get from node A to child A'.<p>The staging area is pretty simple. You can think of it as a ""WIP"" snapshot: it's what gets recorded in the tree when you make your next commit. It may seem like extra work if you're just used to committing every change you have in the working directory, but at least I tend to not want to do that, and git has some pretty cool tools for crafting neat commits out of working tree contents. :)<p>A node can of course have multiple children, so branches are natural in the git world. ""Named"" branches are merely pointers to a snapshot somewhere in the branching structure of the tree.<p>Merges happen when two branches join together: a new merge snapshot M has edges from both parents A and B (or more, if needed) representing the conflict resolution, and M represents the finished merge.<p>Rebasing or reparenting is somewhat different. You can think of it as <i>cutting</i> a branch from the tree and gluing it elsewhere. ie. if you rebase branch B onto branch A, then the divergence point of A and B is looked up, and all the edges (diffs) from that point on until the tip of B are applied on top of A, resulting in a series of completely new snapshots. This is why rebasing is ""dangerous"" or destructive: branch B is no longer the branch it once was, but something completely different.<p>Unlike in a merge, information about the original branches, or any changes needed to fit the changes on top of the new base, is discarded.<p>Of course, git won't actually destroy anything during rebases either. As long as you keep a reference to the original branch B, git will keep the snapshots and you can go back to them. There's just no straightforward way to tell that the original B has at one point been rebased on top of A.<p>EDIT:<p>I think I should note that every ""ref"" in git is a reference to this giant tree data structure. Let's take for example origin/master. When you fetch changes from the origin repository, git fetches snapshots from the remote data structure, includes them in your own local one, and updates origin/master reference to point to the correct tip in the data structure so that it corresponds to the remote's master branch.<p>The same happens for other branches, too of course, depending on what you tell git to fetch. (git can also handle snapshots completely unrelated to other commits in the repository. ie. you can have multiple root commits, but that's not often done. :P)<p>A ""pull"" then goes a step further and merges your local 'master' with origin/master and updates your local reference. (origin/master remains untouched until you fetch new changes or successfully push your merged master to the remote)<p>In essence, git manipulates references to a growing, mostly immutable, distributed data structure. I think it's simple and elegant, but YMMV. :)",1296827431

I graduated with a BS in ECE a few months ago, and also felt like I wasted 4 years for a piece of paper, but in those 4 years, I gained a lot of web development experience. While interviewing for the next few months after graduation, I saw that I knew a lot more about web development than EE, and that I was more interested in web development and CS. I landed a programming job where I'm learning more than I've learned during four years of electrical engineering courses.
So my advice is to find what you're more interested in, and maybe you have college work or extra-curricular experience that can help. Engineering and CS share a similar thought process, and employers look for this in their technical interviews - especially if they know you don't come from a formal CS education.

I have absolutely no formal training.  It took me 2 years to find my first job and then I was thrown into the deep end.  It was simultaneously frustrating and exhilarating.  There were so many times I didn't know what to do or didn't have enough ""tools"" in my box.  So I had to figure it out and find sources of learning.  But I always did.  Any when I got that first thing working and then saw my customer's eyes light up, I was hooked.<p>Your CS degree may make you think that you're a ""push"" learner, but may I suggest that you adopt a ""pull"" approach.  Forget what you think you know and find a job or a project or someone who has a real need.  Then build what you need.  You a several advantages over me:  (a) It shouldn't take you long to find that job/demand/customer.  Just keep looking.  (b) You already have tools in your tool box, maybe not the right ones for the job, but you have <i>something</i>.  And (c) It's easier than ever to adopt a ""pull"" approach.  Help is everywhere.<p>You may feel frustrated, but I don't think you have a problem at all.  You're in a great (and very normal) situation.  Just adjust you attitude, find something to build, and do it.",1296824920

I have been using every SCM since CVS basically like CVS (Subversion and Git specifically).
2. I have a GitHub account I use to host all my open source and commercial code.
3. I got it because it was the ""cool thing to do"" and I felt left out of the loop ignoring Git for so long.
4. I have no idea how to <i>really</i> use Git in the ways that make Git a powerful thing.
5. The few times I have seen real Git errors like ""Snapshot cannot be rebased, please schnoggleford your glerpentrap!"", they have freaked me out and never been immediately obvious as to what is wrong; if it weren't for Google search'ing error phrases I would probably be using post-it notes with hand-written source code as my SCM system.
6. I <i>REALLY</i> want an graphic showing these different concepts explained in the article. I am a visual learner and reading (at 6am) through the snapshot re-parenting section without visual indicators of what is actually happening just isn't clicking.<p>It seems to me a graphic compliment to this article of what situation the main character has every step of the story would make this pretty much the ultimate ""get your bearings"" resource for new Git users.<p>At least I think so.<p>Who knows, I'm still excited when my pull and push commands complete without errors :)",1296824579

Do tell more about it; as I feel that's not why they wasted millions.<p>IMHO management isn't required to understand much about CS, as long as the relationship with the developers is as between a customer and an engineer (i.e. customer asks for stuff, engineer explains what he can and cannot do).<p>Most problems with management comes from a disconnect with reality. Even when they know CS theory and/or could understand the complexity involved (ex developers); having bikeshed-style opinions and making demands with an iron fist in spite of developers advising otherwise (or the reverse, having developers on the team without an engineering mindset that can't think for themselves) ... that's the real poison.",1296824491

That needs someone who is comfortable with algorithms, and that needs a quite lot of thought.<p>The author describes simple CRUD websites and then equates all of web development to trivial tasks like that.

5831600,comment,5830993,5831442,1,0,einhverfr,,,"> Methinks it comes down to the old philosophical debate of free will vs. predetermination, and the innate fear many people have of the idea that you can do anything or be anything if you only work at it hard enough.<p>For the record, I don't think it works that way either.  I am largely a fan of the idea that F. M. Cornford reconstructed from Greek myth (""From Religion to Philosophy""), that we have free will within a granted partition of fate, or lot of life, which is limited in various ways and repaid when we die.  From this view, fate is a domain we must strive to achieve, and thus not inevitable.<p>> The IQ ""debate"" reminds me very much of the race debate, that race ""doesn't exist"" and is purely a social construct with no genetic basis. I keep waiting for someone to take a black or Asian baby and place it with white parents for it to grow up and have white skin and a pointy nose and blond hair. So far I haven't seen it.<p>Race is problematic in a number of levels.  Yes it is a social construct with no real genetic basis, at least as we have constructed it.  This doesn't mean however that you can't identify genetic commonalities among different groups.   We could, for example, just as easily say that the racial test is drinking milk as an adult, and therefore Mongolians and Scandinavians are of the Milk-Drinking Race, while Italians and Chinese are of the Cheese-Only race.  And before you say ""but skin is more visible"" it is worth noting that eating together and food taboos are historically much closer to ethnicity than skin color is.<p>The problem though I think isn't a question of mere egalitarianism.  There are people who are for all intents and purposes, greater visionaries, better at recognizing patterns that will change the world, and so forth than others.  IQ tests, IMO will never be able to capture that for very fundamental epistemological reasons.<p>This isn't to say that IQ isn't useful but as long as you are weighing different skills against eachother, assuming the only pattern that works (regarding pattern recognition) is the one the testers think is right, and so forth, what you have is a number which is fundamentally culturally constructed <i>and</i> fails to capture real genius.",1370516034

They have the same concerns, but HN will just tell you up front, whereas most people just won't say anything. Would you rather know what people are thinking, or not know anything at all?<p>I'd say you should just focus on answering people's questions/criticisms as long as they aren't trolling.

This is literally as bad as it gets, in terms of HN standards. And we got plenty of people who paid us money up front and Facebook connected (some people are paying us $200 and giving us access to a lot of Facebook information and they've never met us before). When you're dealing with money and identity, I think you should address people's concerns and take it seriously. Difficult to sweep that stuff under the rug and pretend like it's not a big deal to take someone's money or identity and use it in some way.<p>I'd say expect that HN will be critical, as will most people.

As soon as you are able to process the data you are often just one switch / flag away to also store it.<p>When telephone systems and backbones started to become digital on a broader scale in the 1990, the at that time already existing surveillance or data collection expanded massively because data became accessible and usable on a large scale. First huge processing farms were built for the FBI, NSA ea. and the congress appropriated hundreds of millions for them. For the next version of those server farms U.S. congress already provided dozens of billions 4-5 years ago. Follow the money and you can find out since when this is going on.<p>With every step our world is becoming more digital these ""virtual images"" of us will become more complete and we will become more dependent on them. Ask yourself how often you are still using a paper map today vs 10 years ago, soon there will be a generation of people living that will only navigate with digital maps and GPS leaving a trace of their every movements - for them it will be the norm and they will not know another way. If you prefer a more positive image think about people living with a heart disease and how many of them will survive because of 24/7 surveillance.<p>One key element with all that data often overlooked is that once we depend on it within many areas of our lives, falsification of ""data elements"" or blocking access to ""data services"" has substantial impact on the person herself. Thinking about finding a new job so that you can pay your rent - almost every step within that is already digital. And faking email conversations, phone interviews etc today only requires limited resources for ""someone"" having mandatory access to the mail servers and internet infrastructure. Putting incriminating material on computers of your business / political / life ""opponents"" might already be a drag and click activity for some of those. Falsificating / sabotaging financial transactions have been reported from various political activists since years and are for years already part of Hollywood folklore / films. In short - soon ""some"" will be able to completely change our real lives by ""working the data"" - if we are economically successful, whom we meet, what we think about others / products / politics, if we die from diseases or not...<p>It would be too easy to say that what happens with all the data about us, our activities and interactions is a matter of what society we are living in, if it's a true democracy with civil rights or an oppressive state. This per se is an illusion. It is denying how the majority of people are living their lives, they want to be part of a community, be safe, have no problems, enjoy incentives (or things you can buy). And it is denying how governments work, because the sole existence of such a feedback / control / surveillance / oppression mechanism is changing society itself and the way we are governed.<p>Think along the lines - what can be done will be done. And if powers of ""some"" in our societies continue to be expanded day-after-day - it certainly will.",1370514472

Someone who hears a rare misconception they've figured out the answer to<p>2. Someone who hears you're talking about a fringe technology they are also passionate about<p>3.

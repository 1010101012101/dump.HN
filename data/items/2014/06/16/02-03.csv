7897178,comment,7895268,7895747,2,0,doorhammer,,,"> Erlang: genuinely useful for its use case, distributed systems. This is a language where the intended use was really woven in the language design, to great effect. For the rest, it&#x27;s a bit like ML without types. Personally, I see no good reason for leaving out types, so that tends to annoy me a bit.<p>I believe there&#x27;s an interview with Joe Armstrong (creator of Erlang) where he mentions that the one thing he&#x27;d wished he&#x27;d added to Erlang was a type system at the jump.  I&#x27;m not a 100% sure on that, though.<p>In Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good they talk about the lack of types in erlang [1].  Apparently some Haskell folks wanted to make a type system for Erlang, so they called up Joe Armstrong and asked what he thought. (this is all a really cursory outline; check the sources for better info)<p>Joe Armstrong recounts the story and says that Philip Wadler told him &quot;he had a one year’s sabbatical and was going to write a type system for Erlang and “were we interested?” Answer —&#x27;Yes.&#x27;&quot;<p>Philip went on to write a paper [2] about the type system they wrote, but obviously it never really got traction.  More info in The History of Erlang [3]<p>I don&#x27;t really have a particular point to this, other than it&#x27;s interesting and maybe of some historical interest to folks looking into PL&#x27;s and how they end up getting made.<p>[1] <a href=""http://learnyousomeerlang.com/types-or-lack-thereof"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnyousomeerlang.com/types-or-lack-thereof</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/erlang/erlang.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/erlang/erlang.pd...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ZHq_V41y5SMJ:webcem01.cem.itesm.mx:8005/erlang/cd/downloads/hopl_erlang.pdf+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ZHq_V41...</a> (google cached version; couldn&#x27;t find another version right off hand)",1402887023

7897159,comment,7896776,7896776,18,0,nkoren,,,"I first read about this many years ago, in Olav Stapledon&#x27;s brilliant <i>Star Maker</i>, about a man who takes a magical mystery tour through the whole of time and space:<p><pre><code>   &quot;Then the Star Maker said, &quot;Let there be light.&quot; And there was light. From all\n    the coincident and punctual centers of power, light leapt and blazed. The \n    cosmos exploded, actualizing its potentiality of space and time. The centers \n    of power, like fragments of a bursting bomb, were hurled apart. But each one \n    retained in itself, as a memory and a longing, the single spirit of the whole; \n    and each mirrored in itself aspects of all others throughout all the cosmical \n    space and time.\n    \n    &quot;No longer punctual, the cosmos was now a volume of inconceivably dense matter \n    and inconceivably violent radiation, constantly expanding. And it was a \n    sleeping and infi-nitely dissociated spirit.But to say that the cosmos was \n    expanding is equally to say that its members were contracting. The ultimate \n    centers of power, each at first coincident with the punctual cosmos, \n    themselves generated the cosmical space by their disengagement from each other. \n    The expansion of the whole cosmos was but the shrinkage of all its physical \n    units and of the wave-lengths of its light. Though the cosmos was ever of \n    finite bulk, in relation to its minutiae of light-waves, it was boundless and \n    center-less. As the surface of a swelling sphere lacks boundary and center, so \n    the swelling volume of the cosmos was boundless and center-less. But as the \n    spherical surface is centered on a point foreign to it, in a &quot;third dimension,&quot; \n    so the volume of the cosmos was centered in a point foreign to it, in a \n    &quot;fourth dimension.&quot;\n\n    &quot;The congested and exploding cloud of fire swelled till it was of a planet&#x27;s \n    size, a star&#x27;s size, the size of a whole galaxy, and of ten million galaxies. \n    And in swelling it became more tenuous, less brilliant, less turbulent. \n    Presently the cosmical cloud was disrupted by the stress of its expansion in \n    conflict with the mutual clinging of its parts, disrupted into many million \n    cloudlets, the swarm of the great nebulae.\n\n    &quot;For a while these were as close to one another in relation to their bulk as \n    the flocculations of a mottled sky. But the channels between them widened,\n    till they were separated as flowers on a bush, as bees in a flying swarm, as \n    birds migrating, as ships on the sea. More and more rapidly they retreated \n    from one another; and at the same time each cloud contracted, becoming first \n    a ball of down and then a spinning lens and then a featured whirl of star-\n    streams.\n\n    &quot;Still the cosmos expanded, till the galaxies that were most remote from one \n    another were flying apart so swiftly that the creeping light of the cosmos \n    could no longer bridge the gulf between them.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nWritten, impossibly, in 1936.",1402886716

7897133,comment,7896974,7896974,12,0,Pitarou,,,"Abe is certainly making a difference. But a bastion of liberal democracy? Hardly. For instance, look at the man he parachuted in as the head of NHK:<p><a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-25901572"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-25901572</a><p>And there&#x27;s a large stretch between trying to boost the economy by encouraging female labor force participation and feminism. By that standard, Saddam Hussein might have been called a feminist in some periods of his reign.<p>Opinion is sharply divided over whether Abe&#x27;s economic policies make any sense. I&#x27;m in the &quot;they&#x27;re insane&quot; camp. I&#x27;ve likened Abe to the captain of a ship who, seeing an iceberg looming, calls out, &quot;Full steam ahead! We&#x27;re going to smash our way through.&quot; But all observers agree on these two points:<p>1. Abenomics will be a disaster without large-scale structural reform.<p>2. The reform we&#x27;ve seen so far isn&#x27;t nearly enough.<p>Optimists believe that this reform is just round the corner ... that even as we speak Abe is busy quietly building the necessary consensus in key organisations, because that&#x27;s the way reform is done in Japan.<p>The pessimists want proof.<p>Finally, there is a terrible, terrible paradox at the heart of Abe&#x27;s economic policies. This is a complex matter, so forgive me for skipping most of the details and implications.<p>No matter how you measure it, the Government of Japan is up to its neck in debt, and is still sinking. The only reason it can keep going is because it pays remarkably low interest rates. But the first &quot;arrow&quot; of Abenomics is to push up inflation, and you can be sure that this arrow will meet its mark because they can always &quot;print&quot; more yen. One of the iron laws of economics is that, when inflation goes up, so do interest rates.<p>Now, to cut a long story short, it looks like the government&#x27;s going to get out of this bind by directing the Bank of Japan to print even more money to buy it&#x27;s debt at below-market prices. In fact, if you follow the bond market news, it&#x27;s clear that this is already happening. And that, my friends, is a recipe for collapse in confidence in the yen.<p>Speaking for myself, as a Japanese resident, I believe that the yen is an increasingly risky asset to hold. I make a point of keeping at least 50% of my savings out of yen, and away from the Japanese financial system.

That said, thermodynamic limitations <i>do</i> set an upper bound on the efficiency of fuel cells.  For hydrogen fuel cells, the theoretical upper bound is 83% [1].  That&#x27;s for just the process of turning hydrogen into electricity, and that does not include the process for producing hydrogen in the first place.  &quot;90+%&quot; efficiency is strictly impossible in theory or practice.<p>> i think the carnot efficiency maxes out somwhere 40-50% so no matter what you do (and we&#x27;ve been doing this for 100 years now)<p>It must be noted that 50% thermal efficiency is a <i>practical</i> upper bound for a real electrical power plant, not a theoretical one.

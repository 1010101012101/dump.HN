Key stretching is essential, especially when something as fast as a digest function like the SHA family is used. PBKDF2, as the article points out, can be used to increase the cost of brute forcing, but bcrypt should be considered before opting for PBKDF + SHA.<p>An article [1] that appeared on HN last month (comments:[2]) also explains why just using hashing with a quick digest function is a bad idea, although this original article does a decent job of it (despite the author ignoring his/her own advice).<p>This article also uses built in equality tests for comparing the supplied hash to the stored hash. This is bad practice, as it is vulnerable to timing attacks.

Need drives innovation. A niche I would say is something people have been accustomed to not having. Programming like business is either focused on increasing profits(products or features which are money makers) or reducing cost (saving time, money, effort etc.)<p>If I could, I'd focus primarily on writing something useful that saves time. Trying to build something that's 'too useful' sometimes makes the process slower than it needs to be.<p>A simple example of the above-mentioned is inventory management systems (compare selling non-perishables vs selling perishables). An electronics store would use a first-in-first-out approach due to tax benefits. A 'food' store would use a first-expire-first-out approach. The latter approach is quite visible when standing in-front of rows of milk with the first to expire at the front and the latest to expire at the back.<p>An electronic store could identify electronics by type/brand, while foodstuffs requires another level of precision (a batch - all same ingredients used, same expiration date).<p>Selecting via type is much easier than selecting via type and batch. 'Foodstuffs' that are used as ingredients generally require some level of trace-ability - which adds another step into the process.<p>This is where pragmatism (business focused) outshines perfectionism (feature focused).",1341511039
4204086,comment,4200476,4200581,1,0,sgornick,,,"Will PayPal allow GitTip to escrow the funds?<p>If not (and likely not, considering PayPal does not allow for their payment network to be used for ""pre-sales""), then GitTip can only charge for the actual amounts tipped (and claimed by the donation target).<p>Right now, let's say I'm willing to tip $150 per year.  I can then donating $0.25 to ten people.  Since I carry no balance myself (from received tips), that means every Friday I get a charge for the amount I tip.  So I would see a charge of $2.50 (10 X $0.25) plus $0.30 plus ($2.50 X 3.9%) = $2.90.  So that is a 16% payment network fee.<p>Certainly this can be optimized, but Bitcoin doesn't have such high fees.  The sender pays the fee, and even then it is a fraction of a penny.  And the conversion from Bitcoin to USDs is generally under one percent.<p>Cash (USDs) can be received once each week by GitTip as an ACH direct deposit (using BitFloor) or through Dwolla (using Mt. Gox, Intersango or Camp BX) so easy cash-out methods are covered.<p>And there are no chargebacks.<p>So regardless of your politics or what you want to use as a store of value, Bitcoin solves problems very well.  Especially for micropayments problems like this.",1341511016

4204020,comment,4203421,4203421,48,0,jcizzle,,,"I think some of the comments are missing an understanding of sprinting, so I will attempt to clarify:<p>There are four ""pure"" sprinting events, 60m (indoor only), 100m (outdoor only), 200m, 400m.<p>On TV, you just see a person effortlessly ""sprinting."" However, the sprints are actually very technical events. What you don't see is that each race is comprised of four phases: beginning with an explosive start out of the blocks, a drive phase, a transition phase, and finally a sprint phase.<p>The drive phase - which some commenters have concluded as Pistorius' weakness - is where the athlete builds speed. It is characterized by a forward lean in the athlete and powerful, ""pulling"" strides. At the elite level, an athlete will remain in this phase for 30m-40m, depending on the length of the race and the height of the athlete.<p>As the athlete builds speed, it becomes much harder to stay in this forward-leaning position - their legs simply cannot keep up with their body. Thus, they begin to transition into a different style of running. This is called the transition phase - where the sprinter's body moves to from this leaning drive phase into the tall and upright sprinting phase. This can be anywhere from 10-30m.<p>The drive and transition are important. Some time during these two phases, the athlete will reach their maximum instantaneous speed. At no point after reaching maximum speed will the athlete ever reach that speed again. Thus, the race becomes ""who can slow down the least.""<p>The upright sprinting phase is where the athlete tries to maintain the speed they built up during the drive phase until the end of the race. An athlete will be upright, with the slightest of forward leans. Their legs are firing straight up and down very quickly, trying to minimize the time spent on the ground. The ability to do this correctly very much depends on an athlete's ""sprint endurance"" - which is a completely different kind of endurance than, say, running a mile.<p>So, on average, 90% of a 60m race is spent gaining speed, 50% of 100m race, 25% of a 200m race, and 12% of a 400m race. The race a sprinter chooses to run depends on whether they are powerful and explosive (shorter races) or how little speed they can lose while upright (longer races).<p>Here are two fun facts now that you know this information:\n1. Marion Jones (who is a cheater) did not have the fastest top end speed out of her contemporaries. She did, however, have the best ability to maintain speed. She was a 100m Olympic Gold Medalist.\n2. The Olympic-level weight lifters will outperform Olympic-level sprinters in the first 30m of a race.<p>There are some nuances to what what I've said that I won't bore you with (for example, some 200m runners can perform a mini-drive on the curve to grab a bit more speed for the straight), but the basic idea is that your sprint endurance is crucial in EVERY sprint race except the 60m. You can make your own conclusions about whether or not Pistorius is legit, but having run the 400m at a high level for a number of years, I can tell you that not being able to feel your calves or feet or have to use the energy required to make them move would have been something I'd be interested in.",1341510310

It's more profitable to make your competitor (unknowingly) become your economic slave than it is to put them in jail.",1341508898

On top of that his low leg is significantly lighter than non-amputees, though whether this is a curse or a blessing is arguable.<p>Oscars main 'advantage' over fellow amputees that he grew up wearing prosthetics and had the funds to get ones that are good enough to train on. I can't imagine a Jamaican bilateral amputee being in the same situation.<p>The problem is that at the moment he's a one of a kind, which makes comparisons pretty much useless. Regardless of it all, his achievements are impressive and he's an example for a lot amputees.<p>Edit: Here's a link to a literature review I wrote about him 4 years ago.

There are a lot of people with great ideas that need teams for execution. I have a series of ongoing projects that I could plug-and-play a good team into.<p>Questions include:\n1. How do you find the people with the great ideas?\n2. How do you structure the deal? You have taken funding already and are beholden to your existing stakeholders?<p>My answers:\n1. Finding Ideas: Hacker News is a good start. Also, you can act as a contractor-service company and see which projects may be good long-term fits for you. Try finding these online (odesk/elance) or offline (Berlin has a burgeoning tech scene looking for CTOs).\n2. Corporate Structure: You need to be very communicative with your existing stakeholders. Being proactive is essential in your pivot. Then, be realistic when it comes to the deal: Start with milestones are are achievable, and move your stake up through performance.<p>Time is of the essence! You want to keep your momentum moving forward.",1341507805

With the swimsuits, you could test two different swimsuits on the same swimmer and see if one offered a direct advantage. Not to mention, when people that have not broken world records before start breaking world records, all of them using the same suit, it becomes pretty obvious.<p>With prosthetics, however, how do you compare how they run with prosthetics to how they might have ran if they had legs? If they don't break world records, but they place 2nd when they might have placed 5th with legs, how will we be able to know that?",1341507614

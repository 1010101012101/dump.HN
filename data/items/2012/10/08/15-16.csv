4627439,comment,4627329,4627329,6,0,mikestew,,,"Regenerative braking is not just a ""hip, new (phrase)"", it has an actual distinct meaning. That meaning is distinct from engine braking. I've driven manual transmissions all of my life, from motorcycles to large trucks, and to me regenerative braking and engine braking aren't even close to the same thing.<p>As a side note, if your brakes can lock your tires at speed (and I don't know of a modern car that can't), then engine braking in an emergency isn't going to help as the tires are the weak link.",1349711974

And if you have an opinion about that, no one really cares unless you're a mathematician/computer science researcher who has positive/dispositive leads towards a conclusion, or a non-research person doing work, that can be used to push the research along one way or another towards an answer<p>This isn't about standards or opinions.<p>Is the paper correct showing P=NP is required for markets to be efficient? If yes, then ""Markets are Efficient"" is only true if P=NP. ""Efficient"" has a technical definition that's not one of opinion. That's like saying your opinion on whether this chemical solution has fluorine in it. No, it does or it doesn't.<p>Now: The paper is the only real thing for you to attack in this conversation. It's math.<p>""I prove that if markets are weak-form efficient, meaning current prices fully reflect all information available in past prices, then P = NP, meaning every computational problem whose solution can be verified in polynomial time can also be solved in polynomial time. ""<p>Here is the definition of weak-form efficient:\n""The weak-form EMH claims that prices on traded assets (e.g., stocks, bonds, or property) already reflect all past publicly available information.""<p>Why do I only list Weak-Form? Because the other forms have weak-form as a prerequisite<p>And what if you want to ""reject my opinion of efficiency here""? Then you're saying the free market is crap, because its prices aren't worth a damn because they don't take into account enough information.",1349711898
4627434,comment,4625474,4625552,1,0,apotheon,,,"This commentary of yours was well-answered by AnthonyMouse.  I just have to add a point of emphasis, and a chastisement:<p>The notion that Thomas Jefferson was a proponent of copyright and patent law is just flat-out wrong.  He was profoundly suspicious of the notion that government enforced monopolies on ideas and their expressions could have any but the most dangerous, counter productive effects, and has written eloquently of the benefits of the natural tendency of knowledge to spread freely regardless of attempts to restrict it.  What he did was not support copyrights and patents -- it was to resign himself to the fact that others developing policy while he was serving overseas as an ambassador made the decision to include copyright and patent law in that policy.<p>As for the chastisement . . . one did not (and does not) have to be a monarchist to completely wrong about copyright policy.  Pretending the argument is that one must be a monarchist, just because someone pointed out its monarchical roots, is to mischaracterize the argument so you can deride it without actually addressing its substance.",1349711891

4627426,comment,4626901,4626901,2,0,ValG,,,"The way they're going about it might not be the right way, but having worked at and run car dealerships, $600/year is not out of line (granted this is based on conventional engine vehicles). The first year of the vehicle you probably won't get your money's worth, but after that it becomes much more valuable. At a traditional car dealership, a 15k mile service is pretty basic, oil change and tire rotation, but they will try to upsell you on numerous other items (special  additives to improve engine life/gas mileage, air filter change, wipers, etc...) that will easily hit $250-$300 for that visit. These items can all be done in ~10 minutes at home for ~$50. For  a 30k mile service, you're looking at well over $400. To be able to take your car in, not have to deal with the hassle of someone trying to hustle/upsell you, get everything on the car done, road side service, and (hopefully) better service than you'd get at a traditional car dealership? Doesn't seem to me like the price is way out of line.<p>Not only that, but think about the last time you went to a dealership to buy a car, remember when you went in the finance office to sign the paperwork? More than likely the finance manager was trying to sell you a service contract from a 3rd party that was more expensive and covered less items.<p>In the end though it's hard to judge the value of these things without having the service contract in front of me, knowing you specific driving habits and exactly what services the contract covers and what services it doesn't (if any). Having said that, I would be highly surprised if 12% of Tesla pre-orders get canceled because of the service contract (as mentioned in the article).",1349711820

Thus, even if one measures equal ability among applicants, he should prefer those from a group which is stereotypically superior [2].<p>An interesting question this raises is how much collectivist attitudes play a role in this effect. For example - consider two hypothetical individuals from a stereotypically underperforming group. Individual A is a collectivist and strongly cares about the perception and welfare of his group. Individual B is an individualist and holds no special affection for his group relative to any other.<p>Will A be more vulnerable to stereotype thread than B? It's reasonable to hypothesize that individual B might care about stereotypes less than A, and therefore might be less affected.<p>A fairly straightforward way to test this would be to repeat stereotype threat experiments using dimensions on which people are not typically collectivist (e.g., blood type rather than tribal affiliation).<p>[1] Assuming the effect survives outside the laboratory, wouldn't necessarily apply in a hypothetical world with different stereotypes, etc.<p>[2] I'm focusing solely on maximizing group performance, ignoring legal risks, moral issues, etc.",1349711592

The other competitors aren't known to have the level of corporate espionage as Huawei has shown, the level of direct government influence, and telecom is gaining importance in national security.<p>Manufacturing equipment in China and producing Telecom equipment and software are different concepts for security. For example, all telecom equipment in the US has to allow ""lawful intercept""[1], and part of LI is it cannot be detected whether it is enabled or not.  I think if an issue was to escalate to the level of national security, both the US and China would be willing to make use of these features.

I also assume there are some large capacitors involved, as I can't imagine any battery likes having 30kW being dumped into it.<p>As far as I can tell the only time pads touch disk are 1) emergency stops when the generator can't cause enough load to safely stop the vehicle 2) below about 10mph (not much load from the generator) and 3) the battery is fully charged and has no room for additional electrons. The transition from generator to pad-and-disk can be felt if one is looking for it.<p>In summary, the vast majority of the braking on the Nissan Leaf appears to be done <i>without</i> the conventional brakes. I assume the Tesla works in a similar manner, hence my comment.<p>EDIT: added a third reason for conventional brake use.",1349710361

In fact when I had a MB I remember very clearly having to pay for scheduled maintenance that iirc certainly approached $600 per year to maintain the warranty. BMW as others have pointed out includes all maintenance. This is essentially an economic decision on the part of the manufacturer.  They could of course increase the price of the vehicle and give you free maintenance but then they would sell fewer cars. Although in general BMW cars actually are priced comparably to MB they have decided that they can sell more cars by including ""free maintenance"" than lowering the price of the vehicle (at least in the market that I am in it may be priced differently elsewhere).<p><a href=""http://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/service_and_parts/maintenance/src-4050"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/service_and_parts/maintenance/...</a><p>Cars today are very complex.

I agree that you very rarely run into real-world problems that look like a traveling salesman or bipartite test etc. But the thing about graphs is that they are the foundation of ALL data structures, and lots of algorithms. Lists, hashing, trees, arrays and more -- just special cases of graphs. If you can describe anything at all with a boxes-and-arrows diagram, it's a graph problem ;-) so if you know at least the core concepts of graphs, including some fundamental techniques (e.g. advantages of each representation such as adjacency matrix vs. node list vs. edge list), then you have the tools to work through any data structure problem; and any algorithm that's focused on searching or manipulation of specific data structures. And this can take you very, very far.<p>Once again, of course you can learn most of these foundational concepts more empirically, or in a more ""bottom-up"" way by starting with the standard data structures and algorithms that you use in practice, but gradually deducing general concepts that unify them.

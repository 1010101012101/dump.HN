There's an option called ""remember playback position""; check it and it should work.<p>How often do you have to do an advances search? For ones you do often, just make a smart playlist. Otherwise, what kinds of searches don't work easily with a simple fast text search? I'm curious.<p>As for the other stuff: iTunes on Windows is bad. I think it's better than some other media players (though I've heard WinAmp is better), but it's not particularly good. On a Mac, though, it's very fast. In my 50GB library, it searches near-instantly, and I really can't think of any time I've had a problem with it. So I can absolutely understand your complaint with the Windows version, and I hope they fix it, but on the Mac it's really a good program. (Good enough that no competitors have seen fit to exist, anyway, not counting the ultra-experimental Songbird.)",1237010120

Yes having the extra copy of notepad is easy and practical, but it ignores the fundamental principle that doing it the right way is going to have a return down the road.  An opportunity cost in having the capacity for hard links in all of those software components is taken, the utility of hard links to users in other domains not related to the single scenario can never be realized, and you've established momentum for taking the easy way out the next time the problem comes up (""Ehhh, well, we just added another copy of notepad, let's just add another copy of this dll, and this config file, and this, and that, and the other thing"").",1237009925

Who would buy them is a different question though.  Like the other comment, what stops a potential customer from just downloading my page, stylesheets, js files, etc... and making them their own?<p>For unique templates, companies like TemplateMonster have made a good business for themselves selling web templates though and I would see them as your primary competition in this market.  With their brand recognition and affiliate program though I would find it difficult to believe you would have a chance at competing against them unless you developed a different, better, pricing model and provided better services (i.e. include template customization or css conversion at no charge for customers).",1237009568

We had more than enough amenities wise.  In fact all we needed was wireless Internet, 2 desks and 2 chairs and a bathroom.<p>It was VERY nice to have access to a meeting room and kitchen, and great location.  I didn't even think of having a communal printer or fax.  I just did all the printing from  home.  We also used a very 1.0 key system that was fine.<p>With regards to this turning a profit, the same idea was tried a couple of years ago in Toronto and it was actually making a profit.  I believe it was called something like 'Indoor playground' or 'Digital Playground' but I can't find a website or link.  The last I heard was that it was closed down due to a problem with the landlord being a dick, not running out of money.  The founder also went on to do greater things.",1237008860

What would it need?",,"I've got some entrepreneurial friends who have been discussing opening a shared office spaceâ€“hoping to eventually expand it into a chain.<p>The idea would be, a small biz/soho/startup type pays a monthly fee (say $100-$300/mo) for access to a large, comfortable office/workspace with internet, printers, monitors, file server, coffee, etc. A receptionist attends the space during business hours and can answer the phone.

Do you people really take financial advice from ANYONE and just invest away?  Give me a frikkin' break, people are not the victims here.<p>First of all, ""mad money"" is the money you have left over to play with after making solid investments, so the show hardly counts as a serious investment show.  Secondly, people are not idiotic pawns and are fully capable of weighing their own investment decisions independent of what Jim Cramer is telling them to do.<p>It's completely unfair to blame Cramer and call him an ""asshat"" when the show is clearly for entertainment purposes.

515639,comment,515605,515605,0,0,Rod,,,"<i>""The last thing we need is yet another mind-altering substance to be legalized. We have enough problems with alcohol and abuse of pharmaceutical products. Do we really need to add yet another mind-altering substance to the array?""</i><p>That's a good point. Since I am not an expert on the topic, I will abstain from commenting on how mind-altering marijuana is. However, it does seem natural to conjecture that if one smokes more pot, then one's mind will be ""more altered"", right? Hence, why not follow the Dutch model? This would mean:<p>- all shops selling marijuana would require the customers to provide some identification card / document.<p>- a network would connect all the marijuana shops to a central database where each person's purchase would be logged. Each person would be allowed to consume a certain quantity of marijuana per day. If one exceeded this limit, the shop would NOT be allowed to sell marijuana.<p>That way, one could legalize the consumption of marijuana, but impose upper bounds on how much can be consumed daily.<p>Of course, the shops could sell pot and not register the transaction at the database, but if caught they would be closed down. There could be a limited number of licences to sell pot per county, so that no shop would have an incentive to break the rules, as that would lead to loss of the precious licence. The downside is privacy. All marijuana sales would be logged at the database.<p>Would this make any sense? What do you guys think?",1237007268

It works quite well with JavaScript disabled, is readable and does look like a homepage of a product of years of advanced research, in spite of the OP&#x27;s design, which is very light on information, lacking in links, and contains code for generating prime numbers using lazy evaluation, list comprehensions, a named function used as an operator via back-ticks, etcetera. In precis, OP&#x27;s design throws out of the window all the informativeness of haskell.org, and puts nothing as satisfactory in place.<p>Also, the design is not <i>nice</i> in any way; it is instead, merely <i>trendy</i> and <i>pretty</i>. A good design tells something correct about the thing it represents. OP&#x27;s design tells me that Haskell is a newfangled, superficial effort from some company, whereas the current haskell.org indeed represents, with it&#x27;s rich content and it&#x27;s <i>wikiness</i>, that Haskell is a product of community effort and research.<p>This effort of the OP is a good instance of <i>change for the sake of it</i>.",1401379116

Examples include banks with monthly transfer minimums and banks with hidden fees. Simple is nice because there really are no fees.<p>Their customer service is also remarkably quick and friendly, which again is a plus if you have an awful predatory bank now.<p>I basically think of Simple as the bare minimum of what a bank should be - friendly service, easy electronic access, no hidden fees, and an obvious business model. It&#x27;s sad that so many US consumer banks can&#x27;t even live up to that relatively low bar.<p>Sadly, Simple&#x27;s savings interest rate is near-zero and they don&#x27;t offer any alternative higher-interest accounts like MMAs. There&#x27;s also no rewards program, since it&#x27;s a debit card, so you&#x27;re actively losing a small amount of money by using their service versus a no-fees credit card with cashback or points rewards.<p>They also don&#x27;t offer any other banking services - there&#x27;s an online &quot;pay contacts&quot; option, but it doesn&#x27;t seem as integrated or fast as that offered by some banks. Since there are no branches you can&#x27;t really go get a cashier&#x27;s/secured check if you need one, and they don&#x27;t appear to offer the ability to wire money out - you can only ACH in and out of your own verified accounts.<p>I&#x27;ve since switched to a combination of my local credit union and a no-fees cashback rewards credit card. That way I&#x27;m losing less money off of the credit-card merchant skim, and I have a place to go when I need to wire money or get a cashier&#x27;s check for bigger purchases like cars. Plus my credit union offers loans and mortgages at good rates as well. The only advantage Simple has over my credit union is their better online / mobile app support. Their ATM network is OK but nothing special, and since many credit unions participate in a shared-branching network (like CU Service Network or CO-OP), I can generally find one to get cash if I need it.",1401378912

I had been trying to lose weight for a while before switching to Soylent, but found it difficult to always know exactly how many calories were in something (especially when eating out or cooking something using a wide variety of ingredients). The frustrations stemming from this made progress difficult.<p>With Soylent, I know exactly how many calories I&#x27;m eating. I can increase or decrease very easily to make room for &quot;cheat meals&quot; on evenings and weekends which I enjoy much more frequently and with less guilt than I did when I was trying to control my calorie intake with regular food. My weight loss progress has resumed to exactly the rate it should based on the number of calories I&#x27;m eating, which is possibly further proof that my estimation skills on a non-Soylent diet were not very good.<p>Soylent is a preferable solution to this problem over something like Slim-fast or Ensure mainly due to cost, but also taste. The meal replacement shakes marketed for calorie-control/weight loss are generally very sugary or sweet tasting which is not something I could do for 2-3 meals a day for 5 days a week. Something more bland and flavorless like Soylent is much easier to handle as a staple meal long-term.",1401378541

The intention was to thin it out so that wildlife could move around more easily in it and become a small wildlife sanctuary.

First, because Parrot developers didn&#x27;t treat Rakudo as the most important hosted language. Second, because Parrot didn&#x27;t provide the features Rakudo wanted--in particular, its object model was unusable by Rakudo.<p>Those reasons are tied together; the second was used as proof of the former. You can also throw in the deprecation policy as a supporting reason, but that makes things more complicated because Rakudo developers wanted it in place for some things (&quot;you can&#x27;t change things in Parrot and break our code&quot;) and wanted it gone for other things (&quot;why can&#x27;t you just fix this thing?&quot;).<p>I have a problem with both reasons #1 and #2, because I have multiple examples of Parrot developers offering to do make changes to <i>help</i> Rakudo. In my case, I was told not to do them. In the case of sixmodel, the stated impetus behind #2, Andrew and others (who had been accused of not wanting to help Rakudo) were continually volunteering to write the very code that Rakudo developers said they wanted and were continually told &quot;No, not yet.&quot; (See Raiph&#x27;s links, for a few of many examples.

It does not pertain to those who choose to or are forced to disable JavaScript...<p>Often web accessibility focuses on people with a disability, correct. Accessibility, like I said, really is more than that, though. From the Wiki: <i>Accessibility is the degree to which a product, device, service, or environment is available to as many people as possible.</i> Hence it does pertain to those who choose to or are forced to disable JavaScript. It literally means _as many people as possible_, RMS included. Even the WCAG do not solely focus on assistive technologies, but include &quot;a wide variety of user agents&quot;.<p>The comment &quot;just because your screenreader supports JavaScript does not mean you have no accessibility issues&quot; was in reply to your statistics on JS-support for screenreaders. 98% of screenreaders supporting JavaScript is moot when less than 75% of browsers support pushState. In other words: You leave much more than 2% of users incapable of accessing your content. WebAim Surveys show that people have increasingly more trouble accessing content on JS-heavy social sites and dynamic web applications.<p>> A plain HTML website can have accessibility issues. So can a JavaScript one.<p>A JavaScript site can have a problem. If you serve it without a fallback (under the assumption that 98% of your users can access it that way) then it has a problem for sure. I have nothing against JavaScript. I have a problem with JavaScript sites that don&#x27;t provide a fallback or weren&#x27;t build according to progressive enhancement principles.<p>>AFAIK, nothing in WCAG says you must have a non-JavaScript fallback to adhere to their standard.<p>It said so specifically in WCAG 1. WCAG 2 is more ambiguous. You can have a no-fallback application that requires JavaScript provided: You can not show the content in any other way (a fallback is impossible), and you clearly explain in <noscript> why JavaScript is required.<p>Where a fallback IS possible, not providing one lowers accessibility. This is the relevant principle:<p><i>Principle 4: Robust - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.</i><p>If you do not provide a fall-back and require JavaScript then your content can not be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents. Not providing a fall-back goes against this principle.<p>Relevant guideline:<p><i>Guideline 4.1 Compatible: Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.</i><p>JS-only non-fallback sites do not maximize compatibility, they minimize it, breaking this guideline.<p>Government 508 guidelines for accessibility:<p><i>When possible, the functionality should be available without requiring JavaScript. When this is not possible, the functionality should fail gracefully (i.e., inform the user that JavaScript is required).</i><p>Webaccessibility.com best practices:<p><i>Ensure elements that use ARIA provide non-ARIA fallback accessible content.</i><p>Since you should markup your rich web apps with ARIA, and you should provide a non-ARIA accessible fallback, you should provide an accessible fallback for your rich web app.<p>I do know that this can be a point of debate, and that is fine. It is up for interpretation what &quot;maximize compatibility&quot; means to you. If you have legal obligations to maximize compatibility (like government organizations in The Netherlands) then this becomes a harder rule.<p>> The benefit is a development style that is more productive, giving me more time as a developer to focus on solving the problem at hand, be it business logic, SEO, or accessibility.<p>I really don&#x27;t understand this way of thinking. If you want to spend time on accessibility, start with a fallback, don&#x27;t create a website without a fallback and then cheer on the idea that now you have time left to fix the problem you created a few minutes before that...<p>If you want to solve problems with SEO, don&#x27;t start out by creating one :D<p>> but don&#x27;t imply that single-page apps cannot have SEO on par with HTML sites and good accessibility.<p>Good accessibility means good SEO. No fallback means poor accessibility. Draw your own conclusions (Socrates is mortal?).",1401377566

7816733,comment,7816179,7816430,6,0,jonnathanson,,,"I was with you until the last sentence, which packed a low and somewhat unfair punch. There&#x27;s plenty to do with an English degree besides writing poetry. Law is a typical exit path. So are lucrative positions in media, entertainment, publishing, journalism, and public policy. To excel at these fields, one needs to be pretty smart. It&#x27;s a different kind of smart from the kind you need in technology jobs. No question about that. But one is not inherently superior to the other. And practitioners of one path are not incapable of pursuing the other.<p>There&#x27;s a trend towards convergence, however, and formal logic has had a profound effect on the English curriculum in the last several decades. Hofstadter, Tarski, Quine, Levi-Strauss, et al., are becoming required reading in forward-thinking English curricula. Your typical English course isn&#x27;t going to touch the type of logic discussed in your typical CS course. But advanced linguistics is, more or less, formal systemics. Unfortunately, you can encounter a fair amount of fluff on the way there.<p>English education is in need of an overhaul, and it&#x27;s starting to get one. But there should be no battle between the humanities and the sciences. Instead, we should do a better job bringing the average in the humanities up to par and rigor.<p>We should also do a better job coaching students on career paths <i>before</i> we ask them to choose majors. If you&#x27;re studying English because you like reading books, and you have no clue what you want to do when you graduate, you&#x27;re in for a tough road ahead. If you&#x27;re studying English because you want to get into Yale Law School, or write for the New York Times, or become the next Michael Lewis, that&#x27;s great. (But in that case, you&#x27;d better be good.)<p>Ultimately, what matters isn&#x27;t the content of the two paths, but the application of them. CS is a directly practical degree. You can put to work what you learn almost immediately and unambiguously. You can trace a more or less direct path between the input (education) and the output (skill). English is more indirect. You can learn extremely valuable skills in an English program, but those skills aren&#x27;t immediately applicable to any particular job. That&#x27;s because English is a really old curriculum, which predates the modern job market. If you want to make something of an English degree, you&#x27;ll need to develop skills above and beyond what you learn in the classroom. Generally speaking, schools don&#x27;t do a great job teaching those ancillary skills. And so the English degree is not, in itself, sufficient for positions to which it&#x27;s very well suited.",1401377529

So there&#x27;s none of that wiggle room.<p>CS grading is not the same thing as just programs working (and often that&#x27;s not even the most important part of it), and, in my (obviously limited and potentially not representative, I&#x27;ll admit, but there&#x27;s not a lot of structured evidence being presented on any side here), the variability between institutions and individual classes within institutions in CS grading is more alike than distinct from that in any other field.<p>The scope of the curriculum, OTOH, in CS is probably more consistent between institutions and individual students within institutions than is the case in most non-technical fields, <i>particularly</i> for CS taught within an engineering rather than liberal arts institution (e.g., at UC Davis, the difference between a degree from the College of Engineering and the College of Letters and Science), and, further, while there are certainly kinds of analytical skills that are central to most courses of study in English, its not at all unreasonable to expect that the <i>kind</i> of analytical skills that Google is more concerned about are more likely to be central in CS programs.<p>But, overall, I think people are generally overplaying this. The stated preference for CS over other degree fields even with a slightly higher GPA in the non-CS field isn&#x27;t anything like an absolute bar. Its saying that a degree in CS is one signal that is relevant to the Google hiring director that has some weight, not that it overwhelms all other information.<p>As an aside, though, it <i>is</i> worth <i>Google</i> examining whether this signal is given more weight than it should, especially considering their recently-posted diversity numbers and their stated concern for diversity -- since their overall diversity matches fairly well the diversity of CS graduates but clearly doesn&#x27;t meet what they want, they might want to consider whether part of their diversity problem is overemphasizing having a degree in CS in their recruitment material and selection processes. If it is overweighted -- and I&#x27;m not saying that it is -- that would be a <i>lot</i> easier for Google to fix than many of the other things they are trying to do to address diversity (not that those things aren&#x27;t valuable to pursue <i>even if</i> addressing the weighting of CS degrees can address some of the problem more easily and in a shorter time frame.)<p>Full disclosure: I am programmer whose only degree is in Political Science.",1401377070

7816547,comment,7815443,7816361,2,0,fmstephe,,,"It&#x27;s a very tricky collection of definitions. All descriptions of it are a bit vague. For instance under lock-free on wikipedia we read<p>&quot;An algorithm is lock-free if it satisfies that when the program threads are run sufficiently long at least one of the threads makes progress (for some sensible definition of progress).&quot;<p>That definitely sounds like locks would be included. I am pretty sure that if my program runs for long enough that descheduled thread will get rescheduled and continue to make progress. And then there is the hand-wavy &#x27;sensible definition of progress&#x27; what is that?<p>If we take an example from a single producer single consumer queue which is certainly non-blocking. With two methods.<p><pre><code>    // Returns true if o was successfully added to the queue, false otherwise\n    public boolean enqueue(Object o)\n\n    // Returns null if the queue is empty, otherwise returns a FIFO object\n    public Object dequeue()\n</code></pre>\nThere can only be two threads running. So lets suspend one indefinitely to test that our implementation is non blocking.<p>If we suspend the producer then the consumer will eventually stop returning objects from dequeue() and just return null. If we suspend the consumer then the producer will eventually start returning false from enqueue(). In either of these cases we could definitely argue that our system has stopped making progress and the definition &#x27;actually enqueue or dequeue some useful thing&#x27; seems like a sensible one. But this definition should really just be &#x27;always return from enqueue or dequeue&#x27; and this second definition allows us to say our queue is non blocking.<p>It&#x27;s pretty hard to pin down what constitutes a &#x27;sensible definition of progress&#x27;. For a user space spin lock saying that a thread continues to spin in a tight loop could be a sensible definition of progress, but isn&#x27;t helpful for our purposes of deciding if an algorithm or data structure is non blocking. This trickiness makes it surprisingly difficult to coherently discuss non-blocking x-free algorithms.<p>(Luckily, in practice, these algorithms are so much fun that it is worth the difficulty :)",1401375755
7816546,comment,7816184,7816406,12,0,JPKab,,,"I was recently in an 11 week class for Machine Learning.  3 of the best students in this course were females.  What was funny to me was how gender was never really an issue for anyone.  Competent people are typically awestruck by smart people who are displaying brilliance.  I was always cracking jokes about &quot;well, I&#x27;m not (insert her name here), so I&#x27;ll have to go look at her code before I can do that.&quot;<p>The big difference in treatment occurred with the lone female in the course who wasn&#x27;t a good coder.  Despite her having more experience than many in the class, she quickly fell behind.  I witnessed a vicious cycle, in which she (probably due to the way she had been treated in the past) was ultra defensive when criticism came down, which then caused a difference in how she was criticized, which was then picked up on by her...... She complained to me about being discriminated against for her gender.  While I&#x27;m very sympathetic to females in our industry who suffer at the hands of these brogrammer idiots (anytime I see anything remotely like that kind of behavior, I don&#x27;t hesitate to LITERALLY GRAB the guy/guys, pull them aside, and give them a menacing rebuke), this was a case in which gender wasn&#x27;t actually the issue.  It was personality.  And I have no doubt that gender discrimination in her past helped create this personality.  Such a challenge to deal with this.",1401375740

Merchants accept rewards cards because it is what their customers have and want to use- customer shave and want to use them because they are convenient (accepted by most merchants) and the reward is an extra.  If you can offer a secure payment system that is adopted by a significant portion of the market (make it even more convenient than rewards cards), while offering merchants significantly lower fees, eventually most merchants will accept your payment method- and as more consumers use it, many merchants will begin to stop accepting rewards cards and paying the high fees.<p>This is a long haul strategy, and likely a costly battle to fight.

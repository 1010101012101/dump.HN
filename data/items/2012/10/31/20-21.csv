4724902,comment,4724400,4724400,1,0,staringispolite,,,"Feedback incoming! I enjoy the idea, it makes me imagine being a better, happier person, given the context I already have with gratitude and journaling. Looking forward to the invite! A few points that come to mind from my past usage of similar apps:<p>* Have you checked out OhLife? I love that it optionally reminds me once a day at the time of my choosing, with an email (Subject: ""It's Tuesday, Oct 30 - How did your day go?""). Anecdotally, this greatly increases my retention and activation. Not sure about others.<p>* OhLife also reminds me of moments in my past, as it learns more about me. (It ends emails with ""Remember a year ago? You were all like..."".). I've always wanted it to be associated with a mood so it could constantly remind me of good things in my life (filter by mood > X or something). Think 'gratitude' journaling. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal</a>. I've always wanted an app that would make me happier. Gratitude journaling 'coach' app would be as close as I can think of for this vertical, and MVP could be some simple notifications on top of your app.<p>Your app in particular:<p>* Mobile will be great for photos and quick notes, but web input (likelihood I'll be able to use a real keyboard) is important to me for journaling. I hope that'll be an available feature.<p>* I'm on a 15"" Macbook Pro and the path that is supposed to visually draw you down through the product explanation to 'invite' were way off the fold for me. I almost thought you'd removed the invite link. I'd suggest scooting things up a bit, maybe cut off the bottom X% of the phones, since by then I get that it's a mobile app.<p>* I agree with others that I didn't immediately get that it was private. I'd also want assurances that I can get my data out at any time, but the latter may be a bias among HN people.<p>* This will suffer from a ""Mint""-like bootstrapping problem. It's value is extremely low at the very beginning. Any chance it could import moments from an existing timeline (FB? Path?) that I then choose to keep or not in the app?<p>* There's a certain ""one app to rule them all"" mentality, and I'm curious what, in practice, I'll do with events that I want to both (a) remember privately, and (b) share with FB friends. Have you noticed anything with this in your own personal use?",1351717149

4724898,comment,4718468,4721747,1,0,davidcuddeback,,,"Let's start by considering the original source for the story. It comes from this forum post: <a href=""http://forums.audioholics.com/forums/15412-post28.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.audioholics.com/forums/15412-post28.html</a><p>First off, that begs the question: how reliable do you consider a comment on a forum? Are you going to condemn an entire industry based on that? But that doesn't really matter. As I mentioned in my reply to mikeash, that's just not enough evidence. I'm not going to repeat myself here. You can read my other comment to understand why one piece of evidence isn't conclusive.<p>To address the Engadget article, it took one paragraph of that post out of context to make a narrow point about Monster cables. If you read the rest of the post (and probably the rest of the forum thread), it's clear that the author is <i>not</i> advocating that there's no difference between <i>any</i> stereo equipment. In fact, the thread that he's posting in is about how to choose the right loudspeakers. The paragraph that was taken out of context is just part of the author making a point to the other forum participants.<p>In another post (in the same thread), the author writes: <i>""Some systems sound boring, some are absolutely alive (such as on large horn speakers). Others are polite, compressed, but accurate (Martin Logans, Quads). Then again, others are explosive and extremely good at creating 'illusion' of reality such as Wilson Wamm, and like speakers in the $50,000 to $125,000.00 bracket. They draw you into an altered state of mind (hypnosis)""</i> [1]. It seems to me that he's saying he can hear the difference between speakers, which is exactly contrary to the conclusion that you're using his words to support. ""Audiophile equipment"" and ""mundane equipment"" includes more than just speaker cables.<p>[1] <a href=""http://forums.audioholics.com/forums/15419-post31.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.audioholics.com/forums/15419-post31.html</a>",1351717096

Literals are inherently immutable but when you assign a C++ variable a literal value, sometimes you want a const variable and sometimes you don't.<p>I don't think C++ can figure out the map<..> part simply because lots of things could have list initializers that accept lists of 2 item lists. C++'s overloading and implicit conversion conflicts with perfect type inferencing. This is an example of the kind of thing the FQA talks about, where several of C++'s issues collide to produce counter-intuitive behavior.<p>I do wonder if you could get away with this:<p><pre><code>    const map<const auto, const auto> TagDataMap { ...\n</code></pre>\nI don't have access to a C++11 compiler from where I am to find out though. I am particularly unclear on the interaction between `auto` and other aspects of a type declaration--I don't know if you can nest `auto` like this deep inside some other type declaration. I don't see why you couldn't, but wouldn't be shocked either.",1351716325

This is the first one that I think might be of real interest to the HN crowd. The original version came about because I was the founder of a startup and was bringing on an acquaintance as CTO whom I didn't fully know. And frankly, we didn't fully trust each other, so we wanted to find a way to protect our interests if things didn't go exactly as planned.<p>The result was this agreement, which although titled Memorandum of Understanding (aka Letter of Intent) forms a legally-binding contract upon execution. It helps to prevent co-founders from ""screwing each other"" over by stating exactly what will happen prior to the legal formation of the new venture. In fact, that saved me a lot of grief. My prospective new partner and CTO did not work out. She quit right before we incorporated and opted to take a payout as a contractor. This was stipulated clearly in the agreement, so we were able to wrap things up cleanly without bitterness and maintaining protection for my valuable IP.",1351714761

And no matter which materials win, we all win, as the boundaries of electronics as we know them are pushed to their extremes.<p>Silicon is a bitch. The equivalent doping density of silicon is something like the area of the United States, with 25 trees in it. Spread out, over the whole thing. That's what you target, and that's what we get because humans are awesome. But now we get something different. We get new materials that exhibit properties that we haven't seen before.<p>The nanotubes absorb IR. Awesome... transparent screens that make power (only at 1% efficiency, but it will get better). Still, there is a limit to how much power you can get if you're only able to absorb IR. So let's make it better, let's take Graphene (or nanotubes, although I'm not sure if they do it as well) and make the bandgap adjustable. It's like the ""smart glass"" (putting a voltage across a material 'scares' it into interacting with light differently) [1]. Now imagine we can do that with Graphene, but instead of just diffusing light, we can control when we absorb it. Put this on top of your tablet screen, when you're using the device, it is in IR mode, absorbing all the photons you can't see. When you shut it off, it starts absorbing all the visible photons, charging up your device. Put this material in your cars, keep the heat out of them in the summer while you charge your EV. On top of your house (although a plexiglas roof would be kind of scary).<p>The moment that we start being able to purchase the 'carbon train' is a great one. Technology is kind of a mixed feeling for me, it's so cool that we can talk to anyone, do anything (in imaginary land), but there isn't much environmental good that comes from it. Now you can use computers to do climate research or whatever, but we go out and grab the rarest materials to throw into our new fancy screens. Then we throw them away (eventually) when a newer, cooler one comes out. We are locking up all our of materials in electronic sarcophaguses that may never be separated again (at least until we get fusion and heat is free). I don't care how 'green' your laptop is, the amount of energy that went into making those teeny chips is absolutely ridiculous and I'm sure the 'energy footprint' of laptops is near the top of things we purchase. Carbon will change that though. It's plentiful. It's fast, it's new, it's sexy. It's different. We may need a little sprinkling of something special to make it really do what we want (hopefully not), but it's better in almost every way. It's going to blow our minds what the computers of tomorrow are capable of. Not because we know what's going to happen, but because the path we're headed down is going to be very, very rocky. It's time for a good electronic disruption.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i8keEAez2k"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i8keEAez2k</a>",1351714679

4724714,comment,4722300,4723834,2,0,colanderman,,,"Re: PS: Yes, I understand that, and I'm purposefully ignoring it because that information would only help my argument.  Vector drawing elements are richer than raster drawing elements and hence tend to contain more information (e.g. ""exactly <i>how</i> sharp is that edge?).<p>And you <i>will</i> get artifacts going from raster->vector->zoom, because the raster->vector algorithm necessarily infers information that is simply not present (i.e. beyond the Nyquist boundary).  While typically not apparent at 100% zoom, inaccuracies in this inference will become apparent once you zoom in (e.g. ""that pixel was meant to represent a perfect square, not a circle!"").<p>Re: PPS: I never claimed it did?  Music notation is bi-level and smooth edges that makes it well-suited for vector tracing with a bi-level tracer e.g. potrace (and therefore -- again -- aiding your argument).  Comparing a CCITTv4 bitmap -- a bi-level format -- to vector output from potrace -- a bi-level tracer -- would make no sense with color gradients.<p>In case it's not clear, I'm making the analogy CCITTv4 : potrace :: JPEG : the diffusion curve algorithm.",1351713793

4724709,comment,4721550,4723186,1,0,mercurial,,,"> This is a pretty odd thing to say, because you don't need an option type in most if not all dynamic languages, they all have implicit null anyway. All values are option types. The point of a stronger type system is that null explicit, i.e. null == 2 is a type error. And a static type system tells you that before you run the code.<p>Well, that's a problem, actually. After encountering option types, it's hard to live without it. Because you want to be able to mark that parameter A and B should not be null, but C may be. And unless you have a very good static analyzer, you are constantly at the mercy of a nasty NPE somewhere in your codebase.",1351713705

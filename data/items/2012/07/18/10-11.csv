You'll need to build your own GNU toolchain (gcc + binutils + gdb) for cross compiling (don't try to use the one that ships with your OS, it will subtly fail when you don't expect it to), get an emulator (e.g. qemu or bochs) and a bootloader to get started. Do <i>not</i> write your own bootloader code or try to stick to pure asm, you'll get nowhere fast. Use the multiboot protocol so you can easily get booted on emulators and real iron using GRUB2. Note: I assumed you want to work on x86.<p>In addition to OSdev, the Intel manuals are an excellent resource. They are a pretty nice thing to read even if you don't intend to write an OS. Although reading through them will probably get your OS hacking itch going and you can't stop yourself. That happened to me.

I mean I find both Islamic fundamentalism and American actions all round globe both equally dumb.<p>I don't think OBL ever had it as an explicit aim to pull down US militarily or culturally transform US into a Islamic state. That is impossible, and I assume somebody like him already understood that. I guess his aim was to drag US into a war and then reduce them to a state USSR, now russia was in 1990 post Afghanistan war. Long wars benefit nobody. They are a huge drain on man power, economy and morale of a nation. Its actually surprising that US fell for it. I was expecting more of a Intelligence based response where the CIA would hunt him down and kill him, instead of wasting trillions dollars.<p>On the other hand. Afghans seem to be very stubborn people. They don't give up easily no matter how shitty state they are in. Its just in their blood and culture to not accept foreign occupation over them. Even the British that had the entire Indian subcontinent under them couldn't conquer them. In the recent history alone, every body knows what has happened of USSR after going there. So no matter how bad the Taliban is, they still consider them as their own country men compared to Americans who actually released them from their bondage.<p>As a moderate muslim, I feel bad every time I'm pulled up for an ideology which I have nothing to do with. I've been a subject of religious discrimination many times since 911. I've been asked to come for extra rounds for job interviews, pulled up separately and checked at building security points, had troubles to open bank accounts, asked to delay visa filing for visiting abroad etc innumerable number of times. I feel having an arabicized name a huge liability to carry, a kind of burden for which you have to pay no matter even if you have nothing to do with their ideology.<p>On the other hand I see so much turmoil in the west, due to the war ordinary people like me having to pay for no mistake of theirs.

He received a stack of paper over 10 inches high. The government pretty much had every part of his life on file.

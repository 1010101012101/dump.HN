On the other hand, it's impractical to expect that people will know every element of your technology stack.  Most of the time, it's expected that you know the core of the technology stack (like the programming language), but it's ok not to know <i>every</i> technology.  And even then, you're expected to be able to get up to speed on what you don't know quickly and without sucking up too much of your peers' time.",1306087131

In trivial cases, we may be able to do this in two dimensions, in which case the ""hyperplane"" is just a line bisecting two different classes of data. It's easy to see how this can be conceptualized as a type of regression.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine</a>",1306087091

Obviously a more complex theory which actually correspond to observations is truer than a simpler theory which don't match observations as well.<p>Occams Razor says that if we have two theories <i>which both explains all the fact</i> (and have the same predictive power), then we might as well choose the simplest.<p>An example: The Copernican and the Tychonian planetary models match and predict the same observations, but the Tychonian model was more complex. According to Occams razor, the Copernican system should then be chosen. But if the models actually differed in some predictions, then Occams razor would not be relevant.<p>Occams Razor is not a statement about the world. It is a tool for thinking.",1306087083

2573743,comment,2572002,2573432,1,0,tzs,,,"Yeah, but if the press didn't screw up it would be easier to combat that. There are two main errors the press makes repeatedly when reporting on the Supreme Court:<p>1. Not distinguishing between the Supreme Court taking a case and making a decision on the merits, and the Supreme Court not taking the case. There are only a few things the Supreme Court is required to hear. Most of their cases fall into categories that they are allowed to decide if they want to take them are not. There are many more cases vying for their attention than they can handle, so they tend to only take cases that raise important issues and that have been sufficiently explored in the lower courts.<p>When they do not take a case, it (1) does not set any precedent, and (2) does not indicate what they think of the merits.<p>Yet the press often reports these rejections as if the Supreme Court decided on the merits that the appealing party was wrong.<p>2. Not understanding the history of the case and what the Supreme Court's decision means in the context of that history. In Campbell, for instance, one the issue of whether the parody of Roy Orbison's song was fair use, the district court said that since it was parody it was automatically fair use and granted summary judgement for the defendant. The appeals court said the fact that it was commercial and copied the whole song meant it could not be fair use.<p>The Supreme Court basically said they were both wrong. Parody isn't automatically fair use, but being commercial and using all of the song doesn't automatically make it not fair use. The case was sent back down for the lower courts to analyze using the guidelines the Supreme Court set out. However, the parties settled, so we never got to see how the lower courts would apply those guidelines.",1306086258

The goal of (most) businesses is to make money, not improve the welfare of others through good deeds.<p>To increase your the user base of your product, increasing reliance on your product, and thereby increase demand for support and licensing arrangements for said product.<p>Countless business have build their products and their business on top of that pattern.  Both at the consumer end and developer end.<p>This is, in fact, a feature closed software cannot provide.  The ability to continue to use and upgrade software after the developer loses interest in supporting the product.<p>Basically, open sourcing allows you to add features that you cannot otherwise add.  Features that are valued by consumers.  No one buys a product because it's closed.<p>Finally, if your products only advantage is being closed, it's only defense against competition is patents.  So, unless you are playing the patent game, someone at some point will come along and create a replacement.  And that <i>will</i> affect the money coming in.<p>> We are talking about software, not food or clothing. Digital goods are not physical goods so the comparison is irrelevant.<p>Why?

Your argument of ""go get it for free and piece together yourself"" also discusses a finite resource, ""time"", as well as ""knowledge"".<p>The comparison is relevant unless you can explain away time and knowledge.<p>> That is purely conjecture.<p>I disagree.  Remove open source, and the software engineering profession would be far different from what it is today.  The software engineering profession of today <i>is</i> built on the back of open source.  It's not the only element, but to dismiss open source as not being a foundation of modern software engineering as mere conjecture is ignorant.<p>I'm not of the belief everyone should be required to open source their products.  They decide what they want to do.  Open sourcing something might require a lot of effort and time that an ISV doesn't have.  That's fair.  However, outside issues like that, open sourcing makes a lot of sense.  Look at Mozilla and Netscape.  Wordpress.  Apache.  Linux.  MySQL and Postgre.  All these products make the people that build those products money.<p>Why should you open source your product? I don't know.  I don't know your product, or the business.  Or what you are providing.

You might not even care <i>if</i> they're running a server on port 80. Either the exploit works or it doesn't; who cares why it doesn't?<p>Hiding version numbers does nothing at all to meaningfully improve your security. Exploits don't care about version banners. They don't <i>not</i> try the attack if they see the wrong version.",1306084073

Compare using Qt and Gtk to the mess and hacks required to build web user interfaces.\nThe desktop gives access to hardware: web cams, microphones, printers, scanners, cameras, storage, 3D graphics and  proper networking(http is a terrible protocol for a lot of things)<p>The web as a platform still has trouble keeping up with capabilities of desktop apps from 10 years ago. But due to having pretty much no reasonable competitor in the deployment market and deployment being so essential to a company's success the web will likely continue to be a dominant platform for startups and should eventually catch up to desktop platforms(probably 5 years or so).",1306084042

2573655,comment,2573157,2573439,3,0,dvvarf,,,"One thing that gets lost in most of these debates is the fact that many students don't pay the sticker price that universities advertise. At most of the top 50 universities in the US, something like 50% of students receive some sort of financial aid/subsidy. These discounts are often substantial.<p>The $50k sticker price is a tool universities use to price discriminate based on a family's ability to pay and how much a university wants a student. Thus, it's not crazy to see a talented student from a low-income background paying something like $2k a year to attend a top-tier university. Of course, this doesn't really answer your question. This phenomenon still leaves the 50% of students paying full freight, and only applies to wealthy universities that can afford such financial aid programs.",1306083870

He thought that academia was a rip-off, training-wise, when compared to Sun. At his job in Sun, when he trains people he spends 40 hours preparing every hour of material. In academia, we spend two, perhaps three, hours per hour of training material.<p>I think it's probably fair to say that people overpay to be taught material by faculty who really view the lecturing as an imposition on their time.",1306083859

63968,comment,63009,63009,0,0,theirgrrreat,,,"I the article is pretty much spot on; especially the part about how big companies suck the life out of innovation.  Having worked in both environments myself; I even worked at a startup that went from nothing, to an IPO and then being acquired by a big company.  There aren't words in the English dictionary that can fully explain how the business and the people changed over the years.\n",1191653561

63963,comment,63916,63916,0,0,Zak,,,"Shortly after my parents bought a new Macintosh, I found a program on it called Hypercard. It was a RAD tool that included a scripting language with flexible, English-like (verbose!) syntax. I starting digging around in the source code of the demo apps, and it kind of snowballed from there.<p>I took quite a while off after being taught that ""real programming"" meant C or C++ ,and later Java. The thought of trying to write interesting applications in those languages was unappealing. I discovered PHP when I needed server-side processing on a web page, but didn't find it very satisfying.<p>A few years ago, I heard that some guy had created a spam filter that actually worked. I read some other articles on his site, and he kept talking about a programming language called Lisp. I had heard of it, but thought it was dead. I decided to give it a try, and I haven't turned back since.",1191652782

63961,comment,63916,63916,0,0,cperciva,,,"I wanted to draw the Mandelbrot set -- as fast as possible.  This led to an interest in code optimization, which led to an interest in numerical algorithms, which led to an interest in parallel computing, which led to an interest in computer security, which led to an interest in string matching and data compression algorithms.<p>I haven't done much in the way of code optimization lately -- I pretty much gave up once the P6 core came along and started aggressively pessimizing my code by executing instructions out-of-order -- but I'm still quite interested in all of the rest.",1191652703

63959,comment,63172,63952,0,0,thomasptacek,,,"I think you should ask questions of the conventional wisdom. The conventional wisdom says one of the reasons to move a company to the Bay Area is that it's easier to hire developers. You should question whether that's really true. I gave some reasons why I think it might not be, and cited my experience. I don't think it's true. But you make the call.<p>Also, careful with words like ""later stage"". You're ""later stage"" as soon as you hire the first person who isn't getting a founder's stake in the company. For us, that was weeks, not months, after the birth of our company.\n",1191652484

63954,comment,63702,63928,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"When people make claims and leave out few ""minor"" details or is missing some facts for the sake of hyperbole, it becomes less important to agree or disagree with them, rather you point out what's wrong. How can you argue against someone that doesn't present facts? That's not a strawman attack, that's just someone pointing out your mistakes.<p>As for your question: is Bush undermining the rejection of the Kyoto Protocol? I'll point this out: The US has neither ratified to nor withdrawn from the Kyoto Protocol. Maybe the question you should be asking is: why isn't the US ratifying to the Kyoto Protocol. ",1191651206

63952,comment,63172,63940,0,0,anamax,,,"There are lots of places where it's very easy to hire but that hiring ease comes from factors that reduce the success rate.<p>Does harder hiring in the SF Bay Area hurt or does it merely help weed out things that don't have a chance for some other reason?<p>As far as later stage employees go, successful silicon valley companies go elsewhere for what they can get elsewhere.<p>I think that you should start where you think that you have the best chance of success.  I don't think that ""harder to hire"" or ""more expensive"" captures sufficient detail, but it's your company, so that's your call.",1191650575

In the end it is just a stream of bits.<p>However I agree with you at a higher level. Our computer &quot;file&quot; systems have not evolved. And now they are being displaced by hundreds of isolated apps the manage out content. e.g. You might own the Jungle Book in your Nook account, but your copy of Peter Pan is on Amazon. Worse still, you don&#x27;t even own these books anymore, they are instead a lease, which can be revoked at any time.",1397570345

7591811,comment,7591186,7591637,1,0,jrabone,,,"From previous discussion, quoting &#x27;jbk&#x27;<p><i>VLC allows amplification of the INPUT above the sound that was decoded. This is just like replay gain, broken codecs, badly recorded files or post-amplification and can lead to saturation.</i>\n<i>... snip ...</i>\n<i>At worse, this will reduce the dynamics and saturate a lot, but this is not going to break your hardware.</i><p>Except it can - because the saturation skews the power distribution towards higher frequencies which weren&#x27;t designed for. This is very, very well known - it&#x27;s the reason why one always chooses an amplifier with higher output rating than the speakers, often by a factor of two. It&#x27;s  counter-intuitive but driving a low-rated amp into saturation can overheat and destroy tweeters. (Guitar amps get away with it by having massive voice coils on a speaker which will only ever need to reproduce up to about 5kHz.)",1397570323

7591745,comment,7591049,7591248,1,0,dspillett,,,"<i>> How can they not be vulnerable?</i><p>It very much depends which variant you have installed. 10.04 is not vulnerable at all as it runs with 0.98.something (with some backported fixes, not including the exploit). 12.04 was vulnerable (it carries OpenSSL v1.0.1). There is a very similar situation with Debian&#x27;s OldStable and Stable, and no doubt with the stable/long-term-support releases from RedHat and everyone else.<p>It also depends what they are testing: some things might be complied against GNUTLS instead of OpenSSL. That has had a vulnerability in recent months too, but is completely unaffected by this one.<p>If you are not using HTTPS (or other TLS wrapped protocols) at all on those servers then you are never going to be susceptible to this particular attack at all. OpenSSH apprently does not use OpenSSL in a manner that exposes he problem, so if all you expose is HTTP and SSH then you are fine (though if your users are sending anything sensitive over plain HTTP they are at risk from other problems).",1397569559

There&#x27;s QuickTest-like testing, which is tricky in this sort of situation, but powerful if you take the time. There&#x27;s static analysis, which are basically a form of automated testing. In fact, static analysis <i>can</i> in fact test some of the things you claim can&#x27;t be tested. Some of the other things are also more testable than you are saying, such as resource exhaustion, which can be both simulated via injection or via simply exhausting resources in the test case.<p>Further, even the relatively-weak guarantees that traditional unit testing can provide are a <i>foundation</i> for further analysis. What&#x27;s the point of analyzing a bit of code for whether or not it uses entropy correctly if you miss the fact that the code is straight-up <i>buggy</i>? Given the demonstrated difficulty of writing code even before it&#x27;s <i>security</i> code without solid testing, this is hardly the time to be claiming that testing isn&#x27;t necessary.<p>This strikes me as another iteration of the Real Man argument (&quot;Real Men write in assembler&quot; being one of the originals).

The purpose is to reduce the cost and finality of anti-aliasing filters when sampling the signal, it is just cheaper to manufacture. There&#x27;s a good reason for this being the standard in professional audio, they need to buy a LOT of audio interfaces, many studios will have thousands of such inputs.<p>Thanks to the basic laws governing signals, we know with near certainty that not only is 192KHz overkill, but so is 48KHz, and so is 44.1. Without significant new evidence showing humans hearing signals with frequencies greater than 24KHz, you will not make any convincing argument as to why we should go with any sample rate higher than 48KHz for human listening.<p>As for 24-bit, it is another production interchange format. It&#x27;s there so that you don&#x27;t need to stand around adjusting gain knobs on audio interfaces so that you get decent fidelity but also don&#x27;t clip. With 24-bit you can just sample your audio once, and assuming it&#x27;s within a reasonable range, you can adjust the gain in the discrete signal. There is some indication that 16-bit sampling is less than completely ideal. The very best ears in humanity(newborn ears) distinguish about 21 bits in the safe ranges of amplitude, 24-bit may make sense in an audio system for newborn babies.<p>I feel that in 2014, music should be released in the best format available from the studio, and if you want a crappier version so that you can shove only 100 songs on your iWhatever, that&#x27;s your choice.",1397568085

What I like about Riot is that I can actually understand exactly what&#x27;s going on in my application&#x27;s architecture without going through so many layers of abstraction and endless lines of code. Its event-oriented nature reminds me of developing for Flex using PureMVC. It results in loose coupling without resorting to magic.<p>I&#x27;m not using Riot&#x27;s router (I use jQuery Mobile&#x27;s integrated router instead).<p>About the template library, it got more useful after including support for object hierarchies, but I&#x27;ve mostly switched to Handlebars to take advantage of its support for collections and conditions. I understand the argument about keeping all presentation logic in JavaScript inside the presenter, but for my application at least, it seems that keeping the view in HTML+DSL results in tighter code.<p>Of course application requirements vary widely, and I agree that some could benefit for instance of components and two-way data binding.

What&#x27;s the difference? They both look crappy! \nMany people have an opinion on high res audio formats but they are so many places to go wrong.\nAudio should be given a little more credit for it immersive ability. When done right it can take you places. Something to consider is that our eyes can only see 1 octave of information our ears can hear 10 octaves. Whilst these high res formats aren&#x27;t needed for every application they do make a big difference when the source material can take advantage of it.

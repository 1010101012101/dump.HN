I wasn&#x27;t saying that private law anarchy imposes things on people <i>per se</i>; I was saying that it imposes things on people <i>if</i> they are forced to adopt it because the national betting market said that would be the best way to improve national welfare. The whole point of private law anarchy is that people <i>choose</i> it voluntarily.<p>With regard to the more general point, yes, living in a society at all imposes certain restraints on people, but there are different ways that can be done. One way is for people to rationally understand the benefits of living in a society as opposed to living as Robinson Crusoe individuals, and to be willing to accept restraints that are necessary parts of getting the benefits. The other way is for society to impose the restraints regardless of whether the people being imposed on agree with the need for them. In any real society, there will be some element of the second way; but I think all of our current societies are far too quick to adopt the second way instead of letting the first way work.",1380913181

It&#x27;s a technology problem that is surrounded by legacy systems, culture, and regulations.<p>Ultimately, though, I believe that those banks that can most quickly infuse themselves with modern technology and -- most importantly -- actually run themselves like technology-first institutions, will be the ones that have the most success in the future.

Anonymity systems rely on people transmitting particular messages in particular ways, whether online or offline.  When someone makes an anonymous statement to a newspaper, they do so with the assistance of the reporter who writes the article -- that reporter is repeating what someone else said, and not publishing the person&#x27;s name.  Tor, anonymous remailers, and related systems all operate on the same principle:  by running a Tor relay or a remailer, you are agreeing to repeat the contents of a message without its headers.<p>&quot;Whether we like it or not, governments are ultimately the overseers that permit networking infrastructure comprising the internet to be built&quot;<p>True, but only on a technicality -- the government also allows us to have computers in the first place.  The truth is that we do not need the government to &quot;allow&quot; the Internet; the Internet would be a lot slower without the government allowing fiber and coax to be put along public streets, but we could have built an Internet of point-to-point wireless links without having to ask permission (using only ISM bands, IR, and optical systems, for example).  The government could outlaw such things, but that does not mean that the lack of such laws is an <i>allowance</i>, unless you think that all your rights are things the government <i>allows</i> (how dare you breath without thanking the government for allowing it?!).",1380911915

Furthermore, vendors must mail the package; seeing as how it&#x27;s not terribly hard to see where packages come from, many vendors are probably vulnerable to simple surveillance of some mailboxes in a region.<p>These people were only getting away with it because law enforcement lacks the resolve and infrastructure to prosecute small scale buyers.

If you&#x27;re in the sun a lot, you would have darker skin (or skin that grows darker as the sun&#x27;s rays increase in intensity per the season). You wouldn&#x27;t be spending all day inside in the Midwest and then be in Brazil the next day. The sun is natural, the way you&#x27;re exposing (or not exposing) yourself to it is what is unnatural.<p>It&#x27;s the same argument that cyanide is natural. Yeah, but humans tend not to find cyanide very tasty at all (as an evolutionary protection). People don&#x27;t go around eating peach pits just for fun. Pure cyanide being added to foods in concentrated doses as a poison is a human invention and is not natural. Melatonin being used by the body to regulate sleep cycles <i>is</i> natural in the sense that it happens whether we supplement it or not.

The old standard, television advertising, can tie viewers to demographics but struggles with tracking conversions and understanding buying intent.<p>To try to get my head around the scope of this I did a bit of searching around for data on Television advertising. CBS got advertising commitments of $2.7B [1] for placement on its prime time shows. Prime time is 3 hours a night (7-10 or 8-11 depending on your time zone). Assuming 41 advertisements per hour [2] that is 123 Adds per day, 7 days a week is 861 ads, 52 weeks is 44,772 ads per year. If they sold them for $2.7B in commitments that is $60,305 per single advertising placement, one day, one show, one advertisement.

For example, if a user acted as a node (relay not exit) they mined a currency (probably inflationary.) If a user did not act as a node, they had to pay a currency which would then be distributed to exit node operators. The currency could be bought and sold through exchanges rather than to a central commercial entity.<p>The end goal, besides having a lot more network bandwidth, would be to have so many relay and exit nodes running it would be economically impossible for a single entity to compromise a significant number of them.<p>Of course, easier said than done.",1380910569

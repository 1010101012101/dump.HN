6547255,comment,6543892,6546574,1,0,vidarh,,,"> But the problem is precisely that the flats aren&#x27;t even rented out; they&#x27;re just left sitting empty<p>Are they? According to the London Empty Homes Audit, january 2012 done on behalf of the GLA, there were 11202 units sitting empty in London at the time. londoncouncils.gov.uk on the other hand reports almost 80,000, or about 2.4% of units based on numbers from emptyhomes.com. Either way that seems way too small for property investors leaving flats empty being a big problem, especially given that a lot of these empty units are very obviously empty for other reasons, such as being in very undesirable state or bad locations. E.g. I very much doubt the 6k total that the source of the 80k number lists for Newham and Tower Hamlets is due to foreign investors (unless someone got scammed good).<p>Looking at the numbers for the rest of England from the same source indicates that London is middle of the tree in terms of percent of properties left empty compared to other regions, which you wouldn&#x27;t expect to see if foreign investors was a particular problem in London. So either they&#x27;re just as much of a problem elsewhere, or they&#x27;re not having much impact in London.<p>The 80k source also breaks out the number of properties empty more than 6 months, and that is down to about 34k. Furthermore about 1/4 of empty properties are owned by the councils, housing associations or other semi-public bodies. So the percent of the total available properties left empty by investors necessarily can&#x27;t be very high. Lets assume the councils etc. never leave their properties empty more than 6 months (yeah, right), and the whole 34k number is investors, as opposed to owners temporarily living out of country etc. - that is still just barely 1% of the market.",1381759197

6547252,comment,6546350,6546911,2,0,KaeseEs,,,"There are many, many people who use C and rarely or never use C++.  Most embedded work is done in C, the Linux and BSD kernels are in C, etc.  There are a variety of reasons for this, with audit-ability and debug-ability being two big ones.  Code space is also a reason, although there are ways to make C++ mostly behave the way you want it to on all but the teensy tiniest platforms (although the resulting code is sometimes a questionable upgrade over just writing the thing in C).  A great number of language interpreters are also written in C rather than C++ (cpython being one of them) - easier bindings are one reason for this.<p>As another datum, where I went to school the intro to CS data structures and algorithms courses were taught in C++ and the operating systems course was taught in C.  In my day to day work I use C and a tiny bit of assembly (more reading than writing).",1381759158

Poor people have kids when they can&#x27;t afford to raise them, give them education, health care or even as simple a necessity like food. The net result is poverty, which worsens with every kid they have.<p>If you look at it closely, many a times its due to total ignorance about contraceptive methods.<p>So educating the poor, especially in third world nations is actually a very nice way of tackling poverty.

I say there&#x27;s a pyramid.  You say thats a politically incorrect concept to think about from a psuedo-right perspective, therefore it surely doesn&#x27;t exist and all topic change-y.  Bzzt try again.  Is there or is there not a pyramid of skills, and if a working definition of the level of civilization is looking at how the downtrodden are treated, what are you proposing?<p>There is another issue that as a civilization we&#x27;ve decided civilization means citizens will have police, fire, libraries, schools, national defense, unemployment, welfare of some forms, foreign aid, all that stuff (More civilized nations or more civilized people believe health care belongs on this list, and I agree).  Anyway it takes $X to provide those services privately or via taxes, or the govt at an overhead cost of Y*$X will provide those services by taking extra money from everyone else and redistributing from each according their ability and to each according to their need.  The &quot;welfare queen&quot; in this situation is the service station, getting labor hours at a below civilization market cost.  Essentially the welfare queen service station is stealing money from me as a taxpayer rather than paying their employees a legitimate fair wage.  This is the well known &quot;walmart effect&quot; where poverty increases when walmart moves in, because the employees are below poverty line so the net effect is negative on .gov and the residents of that .gov who know have to pay higher taxes so Sam Walton&#x27;s heirs can become richer, all while being told this is fairness, capitalism style.  Why should I as a 3rd party be impoverished to make a rich welfare queen business owner richer, because a welfare queen business owner doesn&#x27;t feel like paying his employees what has been determined to be a fair minimum wage?  I legitimately and legally and ethically earn enough income to pay enough taxes to pay my share of national defense; why should I have to chip in more than my share because some welfare queen business owner isn&#x27;t competent enough to match my level of business skill and pay his fair share of taxes via paying his workers a fair wage?<p>Your more fundamental failure is not recognizing that when .gov and .com merge, as they&#x27;ve done globally, a marketing game of divide and conquer makes losers out of people fighting on either side.  The goal is the destruction of the middle classes globally.  They&#x27;re winning.  Some countries are trying a PR campaign where .com and .gov merge and pretend .gov is in the drivers seat of the prison wagon, and some countries have a PR campaign where .com ang .gov merge and pretend .com is in the drivers seat of the prison wagon.  However, if you&#x27;re the guy in the prison wagon at the start of a real world &quot;skyrim&quot; game do you really care about which PR campaign is superior and who&#x27;s pretending to drive that prison wagon?",1381758116

This in the early stages, your graph is isolated nodes and isolated edges.<p>After a while, by chance, you happen to join an existing edge to a node.  That component now has three vertices, and is 50% more likely to be chosen at random than the isolated edges.<p>There comes a point where you join two non-trivial components, and before long you reach a tipping point.  Suddenly nearly every node you choose already belongs to a component, and that component starts vacuuming up everything.<p>Thus we have the emergence of &quot;The Giant Component&quot;.  This transition is sharp and well-studied.  Whether you think of it as &quot;obvious&quot; depends on how much you study these things.  I seem to recall that there is a major result that says that all first-order predicates have these threshold emergence properties, but it&#x27;s been too long (30 years) since I studied this, and I could be wrong.

6547148,comment,6546768,6547051,7,0,betterunix,,,"This is not the right way to look at it.  Finding a collision on CRC256 (a 256-bit CRC code) is nowhere near as hard as finding a collision on SHA256 (assuming SHA256 is secure).  A CRC code is just the remainder modulo a polynomial, so adding <i>any</i> multiple of that polynomial to the string will give you a collision.  The probability of a pair of independently and uniformly sampled random strings having the same CRC256 hash is certainly small, but cryptographic hashes make a strong guarantee:  even if the pair is not sampled independently or uniformly a collision is unlikely.<p>It is also worth pointing out that the hash size is not necessarily a measure of security.  Very Smooth Hash is a good example of this:  VSH has security that depends on the hardness of a problem that is closely related to integer factorization, and produces hashes that are as long as its parameters.  You might need 3072 bit parameters for VSH to be secure, and will thus have 3072 bit hashes; but the hardness of finding a collision will be about as hard as brute-forcing a 128 bit keyspace (estimating these things is something of a dark art, and I am not an expert; it might be that VSH requires much larger parameters than RSA for equivalent security).",1381757916

Sounds insane, yet its true.  Also I think UAW is a hair under 20% stock ownership of GM at this time.  Of course there are innumerable smaller unions who own no stock and pretty much have no assets on the balance sheet, which at least makes them judgment proof if nothing else.  Another problems is the concept of the local electricians union owning stock in a sole proprietorship small industry where one union card carrying industrial maint electrician works part time, and spends the rest of this time freelancing at residential small jobs, doesn&#x27;t even make sense.<p>The fundamental problem is you really can&#x27;t have two masters.  So you work to optimize your stock profits; or employees?  You might have to screw over some employees to boost the stock price to pay for health insurance for the retirees?  So you want to move into Toyota plants but honestly, frankly, the best thing you could possibly do financially for your GM stock ownership would be to completely screw up the Toyota plant IF you moved in?  Are you a non-diversified mutual fund representing the financial security of retirees, or a labor union representing the desires of the workers, or as a major owner you are by definition management representing the interests of management?  If unions start owning lots of stock, who exactly is representing who and when?  The game is a lot simpler if each player only has one master.<p>You could probably make an interesting startup game and/or cardboard eurogame of the whole crazy situation where multiple player factions represent multiple other player factions but you never really know who&#x27;s representing who at what time as the game progresses.",1381757000

Much like you can create a cipher with security that is reducible to the hardness of some problem (e.g. ElGamal is secure if the Diffie-Hellman problem is hard), it is possible to create collision resistant hashes with such security proofs, e.g. Very Smooth Hash, SWIFFT.

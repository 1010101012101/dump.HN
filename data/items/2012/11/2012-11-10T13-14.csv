4766644,comment,4762336,4762908,1,0,trebor,,,"If I offended you, I apologize for that. I'm not trying to offend or label anyone racist, I'm trying to point out the double standard. Technically I'm baiting the discussion by begging the question:<p><pre><code>    If a white man votes for a white man because he is white, he is racist.

    If a black man votes for a black man because he is black, he is participating in black pride.
</code></pre>
Wait, what?!<p>> Suddenly when it's a black guy THAT'S the issue. How brain dead.<p>Nope, the issue is that the same standard isn't applied to BOTH groups. The same issue applies to the straight/gay debate: why is it discrimination when someone straight is in a straight-pride parade, but not a gay person in a gay-pride parade?<p>> Wanting your kid to have positive black role models is not racist, no. That's a not very sophisticated but very valid and certainly not racist reason for voting for Obama that's entirely based on race.<p>I'm not going to go into why I think Obama is a bad role model. I'm white, but I have people I consider as role models...<p>My black role models are:<p><pre><code>  1. A police officer in Baltimore, whom I call my uncle and has been there for me more than my biological uncles.
  2. A parole officer in Baltimore for juvenile delinquents. He's in his job just to give kids a chance to work out their problems, and to change from the gang/criminal mentality they've had.
  3. And a woman who, as a single mother, raised two daughters and sent them to college by hard work and sheer economy. And now she suffers greatly from diabetes and arthritis but still refuses to give up. She encourages ME every time I see her.
</code></pre>
I've seen the lives of these people and respect them greatly. From what I've seen of Obama he doesn't even measure up. If he did, I could have considered voting for him.<p>So please, don't assume that I'm calling you names or wanting to attack you because you might've voted for Obama because he's black. I just want you to consider: could you have been racist? And maybe you'll think of me next time I vote for a white person, and think better of me than ""he's racist"".",1352555743

They don't purposefully make products harder to repair for the sake of it, or just to annoy people, or for some grand strategy of ""they'll buy more of it if they can't repair it""[0], they make products harder to repair as a compromise for other features: weight, external dimensions, battery life, appearance, reliability, robustness. So in a sense it's purposeful, but as an unavoidable consequence. You may not need one or more of those features and favor repairability, but others than you may.<p>[0] People owning Apple products already buy new Apple products even if (and dare I say precisely because) their current device is <i>not</i> broken and has not fallen apart in the meantime. My current machine is a mid-'09 MBP and is going strong, and I bought it after a '07 15"" MBP that I sold (for a good price precisely because it looked like new by any measure) to go more mobile and even more robust (this unibody really is strong). Both of them proved easily upgradeable, the newer one even more than the old one.

These laptops come with reference hardware which means that you don't need to wait for your manufacturer to release their versions of the latest drivers. This becomes a problem especially with display cards, with AMD/ATi and Nvidia releasing new drivers quite aggressively while the large companies take their own sweet time to customize the drivers to their hardware. Another thing I'd like to add is that as far as my knowledge goes, these guys use copper heatsinks/heatpipe system. Sure, you pay for it but good hardware makes for a longer lasting laptop.<p>The service manuals for Clevo are incredibly detailed, possibly almost as much as those Thinkpad ones. Reiterating again, the sheer joy of installing reference drivers over the course of years definitely outshines any advantages that I'd get by saving a few hundred bucks if I'd have gone with a popular laptop brand.",1352554744

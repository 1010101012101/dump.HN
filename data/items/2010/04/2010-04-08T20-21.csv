Nearly every single thread brings up this issue, and the fanboys come out in droves to try and explain away this lack of functionality -- most typically with nonsense arguments like I posted above:<p>- GUIs for multitasking are too hard!<p>- The battery will drain!<p>- The GPS will be pinging all the time!<p>- Nobody uses multitasking!<p>- I don't want a phone that needs a task manager to kill background apps!

So now what do we see fanboys carrying on about?<p><Backtrack backtrack backtrack, revision, revision, revision>
Fanboys: We never said that multitasking wasn't important! We just said that <i>mumble mumble</i>. Besides it's not lack these are just background apps, there's a special magic API that developers can use that's so carefully designed and built by <i>dwarves</i> in their <i>mountain</i> code smithery out of mithril and fairy dust that it doesn't fall afoul of any of the problems we see everywhere else, like UI LAG!<p>> The ""normal people""/people who love to troll Apple users/you like to claim that Palm, Android, etc. have great multitasking systems, while ignoring the fact that those platforms do have noticeable UI lag, and generally worse battery life or performance. If you're trying to make a sound argument against Apple's stance of offering limited or no multitasking, you need to acknowledge the tradeoffs and then show that the stuttering, longer page loading times, or lower battery life are worth the overall productivity increase of multitasking. You can't just claim the downsides don't exist.<p>My point is now proven. See your own comment. The OS upgrade and the availability of an API for background services doesn't suddenly free Apple from these constraints either. I think somebody here even made some claim about how other phone makers had a problem with location based apps draining battery by constantly pinging the GPS. Apparently he didn't read the press announcement where Apple allows for just exactly that function in background services.<p>Either fanboys said multitasking was a bad idea on a phone or they didn't.<p>And if they did they listed a bunch of reasons why.<p>None of those reasons are eliminated with this variant of multi-tasking.<p><i>sigh</i> It's like fighting with people who suffer from continuous short-term memory loss regarding things they just said.",1270758624

Unity3D which is a popular 3d framework for many platforms including iPhone (Where it runs a lot of games) was available before MonoTouch and is Mono based.<p>Assuming the OP is correct in the ""new developer license agreement"" statement (e.g. the relevant section is entirely new or changed) the ""Originally written in Objective-C, C, C++ or JavaScript"" is worrisome.  It technically invalidates MonoTouch.  Even if MonoTouch is hard translating code to One of the blessed languages before compile, you didn't write it ORIGINALLY in it.<p>And love or hate Mono, .Net, C#, etc etc. the fact is that it brings iPhone development to a larger audience which is (IMHO) overall good for the iPhone app world.<p>I seem to recall Adobe was demoing a similar system a few months back - which would compile down a Flash app to native code in more or less the same way as MonoTouch does.  I guess it's entirely possible that Apple is targeting this in their change, but unlikely as this wouldn't allow you to run downloaded flash.  It would simply let you download Apps from the store which were written for Flash, but since they'd been translated to native runtime probably wouldn't be the battery hogs that apple seems to fear.<p>I've been watching Apple long enough to think this may not be a case where they're targeting a specific person/company, rather ... it's future leverage.  If they run up against something they don't like (there are obviously lots of things like MonoTouch and more coming along) sometime in the future they now have a clear one liner to point at for ""VERBOTEN"".  They may still however work happily with companies like Novell to produce a grey-area inhabiting MonoTouch.<p>UPDATE: For the record, the MonoTouch FAQ (<a href=""http://monotouch.net/FAQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monotouch.net/FAQ</a>) states very clearly ""MonoTouch is delivered as a static compiler that turns .NET executables and libraries into native applications.

In other words, Google employees can't trade on news of a Google deal to buy Rackspace the company or Rackspace equipment/services.

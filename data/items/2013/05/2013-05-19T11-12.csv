Also, many brilliant people said heavier-than-air flight will never happen.  Fermi himself didn't believe in supercritical nuclear chain reactions.  I'm sure there are some other examples.<p>But the interesting question is: <i>why</i> is it never going to happen?  I can see several reasons:<p>(1) Dualism is true: we have a soul without which our bodies could not function, and souls cannot be uploaded with mere earthly artefacts.  Such machine not only wouldn't be us, they would be nearly empty shells.  Like zombies, only mechanical.<p>(2) Subjective identity does not transfer to the machine along with the information contained in our bodies.  While the machine would be a perfect copy, behaving like us and all, it wouldn't be <i>us</i>.  Only problem, the others can't make the difference, so your elaborate form of suicide goes undetected.<p>(3) Mind uploading requires an understanding of the human mind that is forbidden to us because of its deep self-referential nature.  Gdel theorems and such.  A superior being could do it, but <i>we</i> cannot.<p>(4) Our minds run on quantum stuff that we can't copy without screwing them (measurements of quantum system tend to have significant consequences on the system).<p>(5) We could never attain the necessary technological level.  Moore's law may cease to apply, we could screw ourselves in a major catastrophic event (WorldWarIII, virus from the lab, environmental collapse, Gray Goo accident, Skynet turning the solar system into paper clips or the banal asteroid).<p>I think AI people only have authority on (3).  Anyway, to the best of my knowledge:<p>(1) is bunk.  The world most likely runs on math, and probably relatively simple math.  Sure, we haven't found the complete laws of physics yet, but I have hope.<p>I wouldn't bet my life on (2) just yet, but it does sound improbable.  My confidence is grounded on the fact that current physics say that copy&paste transportation works. If you were disassembled and scanned into a hard drive, then reassembled elsewhere with local material, it would still be you, not just a copy.  Mind uploading only have the additional problem of the change of substrate (from neurons to silicon).  I'm not sure it's a real problem though, because we could still imagine downloading you back into your body, only with a few additional memories.<p>(3) Shouldn't be much of a problem, provided we only need a low-level understanding of our inner workings.  Self-referential or not, computer viruses <i>are</i> capable of copying themselves, because they don't need to comprehend themselves to do the copying.<p>(4) Is highly improbable.  I know of no evidence pointing that way, and our neurons tend to respond in much more obvious ways to stimuli (easily detectable electrical impulses, modification of the blood stream, sizeable chemical reactions).  Anyway, we should probably ask neuroscientists.<p>(5) is the most probable in my opinion.  That would really suck, but there <i>is</i> a good chance we bamboozle ourselves too deeply to ever recover.<p>Conclusion: like I said, it's a long shot.  Not too long a shot however to give up hope just yet.",1368963116

Set up a Cloudfront distribution to point to your S3 bucket, then setup DNS to point to your Cloudfront distribution.<p>One big point to note is that you need to either:<p>* Configure Cloudfront to expire objects after a TTL (time-to-live) that is reasonable to you (e.g. 1 hour, 1 day etc). You can do this from the Cloudfront 'new distribution' wizard.<p>OR<p>* Let Cloudfront respect HTTP headers and then make S3 (or whatever your custom origin is) set cache-control headers that make sense for how often you update your site. Not sure if/how you can do this with S3, with a custom origin its your app so you can set whatever http headers you like.<p>To be clear: if you don't do this, I'm pretty sure cloudfront caches things forever, or at least a very long time.<p>Personally, I think triggering cache invalidations should only be for emergencies (e.g. someone has uploaded questionable content to serve to other users and it's cached in at and edge). Rather than screwing around with that, save yourself some headaches: pick a sensible TTL and wait a little longer to have things up to date at your edges.<p>Note that by using Cloudfront in this manner, you get the performance benefit of serving static files. If performance at the expense of convenience was your main reason for going with static site generation, you might want to rethink that decision (there are other perfectly good reasons for wanting to use a static site generator, security being my favourite).<p>Do feel free to ping me over email if you have any questions on the above.",1368962537

Hiring for a technical position and 2. Had a listed address within 1,000 metres of the IP address and then plot a confidence factor on a Google Map view of which companies had come back to pay me a visit and upload the image to imgur so I could be alerted on my Android phone.<p><pre><code>    rem first we download the log files from my web server

For the most part, they became disgusting centers for drug use and prostitution. I didn't know they'd closed, but I'm not surprised they did.<p>Until San Francisco is willing to aggressively crack down on illegal behavior, which it's not, it can't have nice public facilities, for homeless people or otherwise. This includes things like the entrepreneur's well-intentioned mobile showers - criminals will destroy them, too.",1368961795

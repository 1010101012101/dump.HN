Maybe there are some that do use Wine, but I don't imagine that they will make them available through Steam unless they are confident that they will actually work.<p>So the real question here is, ""what is the real value of this assuming you already have a dedicated Windows PC or a dual boot for gaming?""<p>For myself it is nice to have a few good quality indie games available to play if I fancy a short break from coding on my Linux box without having to power cycle my PC.

</code></pre>
I'm not sure how Kurzweil feels about that but to me the whole point of creating sentient machines is to achieve human-like intelligence without all hindrances and idiosyncrasies that come with being a human.  I'm thinking of a thing like Data (or Spock) from Star Trek.  Are these guys not ""sentient""?  I know they're not real but they don't seem outwardly implausible or self-contradictory.<p>Furthermore, wouldn't some humans fail to qualify as ""sentient"" (or, at least, ""Homo-complete"") based on this definition?  What about early homo sapiens?  Do we know for sure they had the capacity for schizophrenia or autism?  Is it at least conceivable that very early humans lacked the capacity to love in the same way as modern humans?  How about future generations?  If they find a cure for depression, won't tomorrow's pill-popping, ultra-content humans also be ""sentient""?<p>2) Even if you grant him this assumption, it seems like the author is essentially saying that the only way to be ""Homo-complete"" is to be a ""Homo"" (pardon me).  That may very well be true and I think the author makes a compelling argument that it is.  But I still don't see why being a human is the only way to be ""sentient"".",1358884498

I think it's important to engage in other activities in order to reset your brain and even gain perspective.<p>I probably have too many hobbies.  Some techie, others not so.  One activity I have enjoyed for nearly twenty years is Schutzhund Obedience training my dogs.  I have now gone through this process four times (always German Shepherd Dogs).  I find it incredibly rewarding and lots of fun.  Nothing like spending a couple of hours at a park training your dog to completely unplug you from the keyboard.<p>It's even more fun when you get to teach your kids how to train the dogs.  For kids this inspires confidence, inner-strength, self-reliance, compassion, understanding and a whole host of other good qualities that you just can't get out of playing video games all day.  A dog is almost a perfect mirror of who you are.  They reflect how you treat them and how you relate to them.  If you are mean they'll be skittish and afraid.  If you are firm but fair they'll be confident and willing to do anything you ask. If you are not disciplined and consistent they'll be confused and will not respect you.  Too many lessons in just one activity to list here.<p>If you've never seen Schutzhund, here's a really neat video:<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTZmIFdgU2M<p>I am not affiliated with this dog or this kid at all.  I just think this video is a beautiful example of the connection that can be created between a dog an its owner.  Keep in mind that in this video she was seven years old.

Should I give up all rights of private property because of this error?<p>You and me would both be alarmed if someone entered our house after we forgot to lock the door, but I wouldn't consider that persons entry into my house a crime in itself (obviously, its probably still a crime whether I agree or not). Do you forfeit rights to your private property for forgetting to lock your door? Not at all. If you wake up in the middle of the night and someone is in your house, and you shoot them, you did nothing wrong. Whether or not you locked the door, your life is at risk if you assess the situation incorrectly (goes for daytime too). When that person entered into somebody else's house uninvited, they made a decision to subject themselves to your discretion.<p>> If they took anything, it would still be stealing--even though one could argue that if I ""really"" didn't want anyone to take my stuff, I would have locked my door.<p>They would be wrong telling you that you forfeited your rights to your belongings for not locking your door. If that were the case, nobody would be obligated to pay for anything at the grocery store or mall.<p>> Should the rights of people and companies be completely dependent on their ability to write invulnerable code?<p>It is up to you to defend your rights, nobody else. If you are going to offer a service and want to protect the server, data, code, licenses, etc.. the burden is on you to protect it through whatever means you see fit. It is no one else's job to protect your product.<p>> I would submit that that is not a sustain way for the law to operate.<p>The reason for that may be because we shouldn't rely on the law to prevent a crime aside from being a visible deterrent.  The purpose of law should be to enforce civil agreements when a crime is committed. If someone causes financial damage to your property, what good does it do to put that person in jail? Wouldn't a better solution be to have your property returned or receive financial compensation equivalent to the value of what was taken/damaged?",1358884381

5099148,comment,5098332,5098636,9,0,_delirium,,,"> PACER is a system for accessing court dockets, not a repository of case law.<p>This is becoming more true than it was a few years ago, but traditionally PACER has served both functions: it's the primary federal repository for publishing court dockets, <i>including</i> actual decisions, injunctions, and written opinions. That function has been slowly diminishing as public access through other avenues improves, but I believe some district court decisions are still available only via PACER. Some of these newer public-facing websites are actually implemented as some kind of no-login wrapper on top of PACER, e.g.: <a href=""http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/opinion.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/opinion.htm</a><p>The court system does seem to have realized that public access to court opinions vs attorney access to court dockets are two fairly different use cases, and there are moves to either free up or even offload the opinion-repository function of PACER. Since 2002, all final written opinions are free of page charges when retrieved via PACER, and there is a special opinion-search function that doesn't charge you for the search results either. But you do still need an account and to give them a credit card, so it's easy to get charged for something else if you run the wrong kind of search, or click on the wrong document. On the other hand, wrappers like that 4th-district one above make some PACER documents accessible without an actual PACER account.<p>Recognizing that that's still rather suboptimal, the courts seem to be moving to using a new service of the Government Printing Office, FDSys, as the conduit for public access to opinions, so non-lawyers won't have to rely on PACER for opinions anymore: <a href=""http://www.uscourts.gov/news/newsView/11-05-04/New_Pilot_Project_Will_Enhance_Public_Access_to_Federal_Court_Opinions.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uscourts.gov/news/newsView/11-05-04/New_Pilot_Pro...</a>",1358884099

For example, if you cluster with a sharded master-slave configuration, then, to serialize transactions that span shards/partitions, you'll need to do 2 phase commit or similar between masters for writes and, for most read/write transactions, make sure you don't read from slaves. If you cluster via master-master/active-active, then, for serializability, you'll need locking or some other concurrency control across masters for each shard/partition.

After all, he was saying that there was no real difference between banks involved in the subprime crisis and any homeowner ""going long"" with a bet on rising home prices. Except that there's a world of difference between placing a bet on a specific piece of tangible property in an open, regulated market, and placing bets of derivations from that market so far removed that they have no clear connection to reality. And he, of all people, should know it.<p>This refusal to see how cynically the inputs for financial models were being manipulated supports my view that many of the quants who played a key role in this mess had no idea who or what they were working with, that they were oblivious to the fraud and corruption engulfing the firms that employed them, and that they failed to register what would happen when things like fraudulent AAA ratings on securities found their way into a system. Among a broader class of market observers this blindness was attributed to a quasi-religious belief in efficient market theory, rejected the possibility of fraud out of hand.<p>The basic problem can be summarized as mistaking the map for the territory. In this case, the map was the Black-Scholes Equation. Or rather, the source of the maps was this formula. People who learned to model various risks to determine prices without properly understanding the equation's limits (there were many of both) ended up with catastrophically misguided decisions to their credit.<p>For a bit more background on all this, see here: <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/feb/12/black-scholes-equation-credit-crunch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/feb/12/black-scholes-...</a><p>If there's one thing that 'Inside Job' makes clear, it's that the policy framework that governs markets is absolutely critical to their stability and value. In America, this framework was subverted by the rise of an ideological (again, quasi-religious) form of market theory that say deregulation as both a practical and moral virtue. This was deep tissue corruption, and as it found its way into the laws that governed market players (or failed to govern, as the case may be), it opened the door to a cascade of fraud - people deliberately describing X as Y.<p>Like a ever-growing fog (toxic cloud, really) this continued until none of the major players had any idea what positions their counterparties were in. Knowing how fraudulent their own positions were, they had every reason to fear the worst from others in the same game. And then, on one horrible day in September, the music finally stopped.<p>To put it in very crude terms, a system built around bullshit eventually choked on the stuff. I'm not surprised that a person who shared more responsibility than most for the resulting catastrophe would respond by entering a state of deep denial. But it's sad, nonetheless.",1358883806

They had no idea what MIDI was and I was only familiar with it for the cheesy music files you could download off of AOL at the time.<p>I looked into MIDI more and realized you could hook the keyboard up to your computer for composing songs, granted I had no idea how to write music. Once I ordered the cables (over the phone from a catalog!) and received them, I soon realized that the cheesy sounding songs sounded less cheesy when I played them through the keyboard rather than the SoundBlaster 16. I also learned that I could set up the keyboard to examine specific MIDI-in channels and I could learn chords and melodies from downloaded MIDI files because the keyboard would have little LEDs above each key that would light up when the notes were played.<p>Fast forward about a decade. Over this time, I had learned more about playing keyboard, learned guitar, and had picked up some music theory and songwriting knowledge. Now, my stupid little PSR-230 could control just about any sound imaginable through the use of VSTi's. I could record music that sounded like the stuff on CD's on my computer using either real instruments or virtual ones controlled by the PSR!<p>To this day, even though I have another, more advanced MIDI controller, I'll often times still use the PSR when I'm working on song ideas.<p>So happy birthday, MIDI!

Should courts submit their opinions to some sort of centralized system instead of posting a link to the PDF on their website? Sure, you can make that argument. But it's hard to say that courts are remiss in not doing so, considering that they are dozens of independent entities. Moreover, someone has to pay to build that system. Categorizing information is not free--Google just makes us think it's free because it charges us by selling our privacy rather than simply asking for a fee. Now it's certainly something that could be done at the public expense, and maybe it should be. But until then, providing comprehensive access to these documents is a value-add.<p>> One could imagine dramatically better products (my thesis is that the right Silicon Valley startup can build them). If WL/Lexis/BL want to survive in the next 5-10 years, they are going to have to get away from publishing and push technology farther<p>I can imagine dramatically better products, but not in the next 5-10 years.

Why is he effective?<p>0 - He knows he's not working on each project day to day, so meetings and decisions are not very top down and are mostly done by consensus.<p>1 - He's got about 20 years of experience, so he can provide technical input and bring in ideas from other projects. If we hit a problem he'll throw out ideas that have come across in previous projects. He's not a super coder or a math genius and technically isn't super strong (which can make it frustrating to explaining things to him) but he can quickly bounce ideas off of us.<p>2 - Since he's very familiar with a lot of people (both because he manages a large group and because he has the years of experience) if our team gets stuck or we are not sure of something he knows exactly who to bring in from outside the project to help.<p>3 - All the above could apply to anyone with enough experience.

Whatever value they provide today might reasonably be discounted by their lack of defensibility going forward. As you noted, there is much room for technological disruption here. One could imagine dramatically better products (my thesis is that the right Silicon Valley startup can build them). If WL/Lexis/BL want to survive in the next 5-10 years, they are going to have to get away from publishing and push technology farther, either internally or by acquiring the very few startups who are doing interesting things in this space. What do you make of that thesis? It sounds to me like your thinking about their value add might be clarified by distinguishing between publishing and technology.",1358882622
5099026,comment,5097256,5097256,4,0,Zak,,,"I have some relevant personal experience. I grew up in Alaska, where Andrea, the woman who wrote in lived for 15 years and raised children. We lived in the woods outside a small town for most of my early childhood, then moved to a city when I was 11. Now, I live in Florida, I'm dating a German and spend several months out of the year in Hamburg.<p>I had a great deal of freedom of movement as a child. I could run around in the woods all day by myself if I wanted. In town, I could ride my bicycle anywhere starting from around 6 years old. I may have had a bit more freedom than other kids in the area, but not enough to shock anyone. When I got a bit older, I had access to snowmobiles and three/four wheelers - pretty much as soon as I had the physical size and strength to pull-start the engines and operate all the controls without assistance. This, too was not unusual in that area at that time.<p>My freedom of movement was pretty good when we moved to a city as well. The city wasn't especially designed to be bike-friendly, but it was possible to get most places without having to ride in traffic. A snowmobile was an option for a lot of things in the winter. Even when we moved a few miles out of town, it was practical to ride a bike to town.<p>Where I live now, I still use a bicycle for quite a bit of my transportation. It's a good workout and doesn't cost much to operate. There are a few places I ride that wouldn't be safe for a young, inexperienced or slow cyclist, but there are alternate routes available in most cases. Public transportation is not very good here, but it's an option that can fill in some of the gaps.<p>Germany certainly offers better parity between children and adults as far as transportation. Design may play a role, but it's also important to consider that it's 90 million people in an area smaller than Montana. Not owning a car can work for a greater percentage of people because economies of scale work for a larger percentage of possible trips. That, in turn allows all the infrastructure to be designed for a smaller number of cars per person, hence the smaller streets and multiple grocery stores in every neighborhood. This situation is probably objectively better when you're 12, but may not be when you're 21.<p>What's really different is parents in this time and place. They're now terrified of things that are less likely now than they were 25 years ago. It's that attitude we need to change more than anything.",1358882586

    Sometimes GV lets you know that it failed, sometimes it doesn't show up in your

    1) A bunch of non-google services don't recognize GV numbers as valid and

You may have to do more leg work, but you don't have to pay Lexis or West.<p>I think Mr. Foster's use of the term ""rent seeking"" makes it clear that he is the one who misunderstands the situation. It implies that through some collusion with the court system, Lexis and Westlaw have made themselves the sole source of getting public domain information. This is the sense in which I was using the ""charge for access to cases"" because this is the sense implied by the term ""rent seeking.""<p>But charging for <i>their</i> copy of a public document is not ""rent seeking,"" nor is it ""rent seeking"" to build a value-added service on top of publicly available information. Indeed, that's pretty much Google's business model--to make money categorizing information they don't own. I don't think anyone would accuse Google of rent-seeking if they e.g. showed ads associated with cached copies of a page.<p>In the context of pre-digital cases, why should ""freely available"" be coincident with ""download[able] for free?"" Back then, ""freely available"" meant putting a paper copy in a public law library (of which there are many). Going back and digitizing those reports, then charging for access to the digital copies is a value-added service, not ""rent seeking.""",1358881632

5098922,comment,5098332,5098332,12,0,afarrell,,,"Records access, storage and collection are not free.  The network connections are also expensive.  PACER has redundant commercial network connections to over 2000 courthouse locations.  Although costs have come down, this system aggregates data from 94 separate districts, including Puerto Rico, Guam, Hawaii and the Northern Mariana Islands.  It is triple redundant, so that the systems can survive any natural disaster.  After Hurricane Sandy, records were still available and the courts were open for electronic filing even though the buildings were flooded and off the grid.  These systems are far more expensive than a simple FTP server; they serve terabytes of data. The Federal Courts are open 24/7 for electronic filing, one of the more accessible government agencies in the world.<p>PACER charges a fee to maintain the systems that support public access and improve IT services in the Federal Courts.  It is very similar to using fishing license fees to support fisheries or drivers license fees to maintain the DMV.  User fees are an important way to maintain systems separate from a reliance on the political system.  PACER fees are the only fees coming into the Federal Courts that are not appropriated by Congress.  Most of the fees are collected from the law firms that practice in Federal Court.<p>One could argue that the funds to run PACER should in fact rely on the political system and come from congress. If you want to change this, contact the members of the House judiciary committee (<a href=""http://judiciary.house.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://judiciary.house.gov/</a>) and lobby them. However, the federal courts have not actually received a budget since September and are under a lot of stress to keep running despite this.<p>One could argue that PACER should be charging 5 to 7 cents per page rather than 10 and should not be generating money for general court IT projects. But be aware that these projects are not frivolous. They save significant amounts of time for the litigants. Given the high cost of legal services, this helps reduce financial the burden on both prosecution and defense.<p>With a cost of 10 cents per page up to a maximum of 3 dollars per document, the implicit comparison to a journal subscription which costs hundreds of dollars is specious. Also, this fee is waived if an individual's costs are less than $15. The OP acknowledges, ""That means that any individual using PACER can download 150 pages every quarter for free."" So the system is already free for anyone who is making casual use of it. There are also academic and financial-hardship waivers available. I argue, as many on HN have done about free-of-charge web services run by companies, that those who rely on a system in order to do business should pay for its upkeep in order to make sure the system stays around.<p>Where does RECAP's funding come from? What standards of availability does it guarantee? If it succeeds in serving most documents but without an availability or document authenticity guarantee, what has been accomplished but a degradation of service? If this diverts most funding away from PACER and makes it harder to maintain reliably, will that actually increase public access to court records? Will that actually contribute to a more just world?<p>As rayiner points out, state courts do not make their documents available nearly as freely as the federal court does. While that is separate from the argument over whether it is right to maintain PACER the way the court does, it does indicate that effort spent to increase access toward court records would be better allocated toward state courts.<p>Also, one could argue that PACER's UI could be better. This is true. Anyone want to put together a proposal?",1358881580

The butterfly problem was the source of at least 90% of the pain relating to cabal installations.<p>They are also going to allow multiple installations of the same package version with differing dependencies very soon, which will help alleviate some of the final problems still there with cabal.<p>I do think that it is not my relatively smooth experience that is the anomaly, but your unsmooth recent experience. Perhaps your installation was somehow borked? Perhaps you were trying to install new packages using a very old ""cabal-install"" that still had long-fixed issues?<p>If you just install the newest Haskell Platform and run ""cabal install cabal-install"" that <i>does</i> work on Linux. For  Windows, IIRC, you also need to install cygwin/mingw (well-documented) and then it is a smooth install as well. I don't know about OS X but it is generally smoother than Windows.<p>Can you describe in more detail the actual problem you encountered?",1358881502

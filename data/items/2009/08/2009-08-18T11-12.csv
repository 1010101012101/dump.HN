White noise CDs, when used with headphones, can aid concentration by blocking out irritating or distracting noises in a person's environment. In open plan offices, large corporations such as ExxonMobil apply white noise to reduce the reach of speech, thus, by preventing office staff from being distracted by conversations in the background, safeguarding productivity.</i><p>Source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise</a>",1250596758

I chalk up most of my frustration so far to being unfamiliar with the tech, in half a year or so I'll be able to make a more reasoned statement on that.<p>If I could start again, I'd probably reach the same conclusion because I'd apply the same method, sure there is some frustration but there always is when you're learning something new.<p>Your last 'be honest' question, no, rather the opposite, I have some pretty major issues with Python (that bloody whitespace thing, it's just too much of a hassle, significant whitespace was a bad idea in makefiles, it is not much better in a programming language). But I feel that the platform has enough momentum to justify my investment in time and other resources.<p>During the installation procedure (django/wsgi/apache on Etch) I ran into a bunch of snags, if you decide to go this route and you are using the same or a similar platform then let me know.",1250595778

770218,comment,770196,770196,0,0,ErrantX,,,"<i>What was your decision-making process when evaluating frameworks?</i><p>Accessibility, features, technology (i.e. is it up to date with the latest language features), development (looking for highly active development)<p><i>Was your ultimate choice made simply because the framework was the defacto in your language of choice?</i><p>No. However I did reject some other language frameworks because of having ot learn the specifics as well (RoR for example).<p><i>Assuming you're sufficiently experienced in framework X now, what are your regrets? What makes the other frameworks look like greener grass?</i><p>Most of the regrets are about the development. I chose KohanaPHP which is a solid framework - and but of a power user one (lowish documentation but very powerful once you get to grips). The problem is that they scrap revisions so easily - version 2 is ending it's lif cycle after a very short time frame and V3 is a complete rewrite using HMVC ideals (as opposed to MVC). Porting to V3 is something of a pain (mostly Im not going to bother while V2 still suits my needs). There are also outstanding bugs in the v2 framework that need ironing out and it's looking like they might not all be done.<p>Also there is sometimes a tendancy for it to bottle neck on some PHP versions / installations - I have not yet tracked down why but it is concerning me more and more.<p><i>If you could start your project over again, would you chose the framework again?</i><p>Yes I think so. I started on Code Igniter and Kohana was a more actively developed fork of that (later fully rewritten) so I was versed in the syntax and so forth.<p>It is a powerful framework.<p><i>Did you choose framework X secretly because you just wanted to learn it? In other words, was it attractive to you just because all the cool kids were doing it and you wanted to add it to your toolbox? Be honest.</i><p>Honestly - no. I used Code Igniter after a recommendation from someone. After finding it frustrated I heard from a forum post about Kohana and how it got rid of those bugs - and it did. At the time the cool kids were going with RoR - their website instantly turned me off at the time so I never bothered.",1250595726

If two libraries have good documentation then you read up on both and decide which fits your mental model better.<p>I tried RoR before it had hit version 1 and the only documentation was the prag Prog book.  Looked through the Zope and Django documentation and found the documentation to be better quality. Django just fit my mental model better so that is what I went with.  I don't regret the choice, sure I have found some corner cases where I and it haven't agreed but that happens any code that you don't write from top to bottom.",1250595664

7456796,comment,7456540,7456540,22,0,sedev,,,"> The other replies were mostly variations on the theme that Android users don’t pay for apps, they don’t have data plans, you can’t monetise them easily, and designers are all iPhone users and don’t really understand Android users … Socially, excluding Android users seems almost prejudicial. Unlike Android is difficult, this isn’t about about mere convenience; it’s a value judgment on who is worth designing for. Put uncharitably, the root issue is “Android users are poor”.<p>This position sells the opposing argument short. It&#x27;s not so much &quot;designers believe <i>a priori</i> that Android users won&#x27;t pay for good design,&quot; it&#x27;s &quot;Android users have a <i>long and well-established track record</i> of not paying for good design.&quot; People are still experimenting, and I think that this is actually a case you can rely on market mechanisms to handle. If Android users start demonstrating a willingness to pay for good design commensurate with the difficulty of producing good design for Android devices, there&#x27;ll be a market opportunity there. Someone will get rewarded for providing people with what they&#x27;re willing to pay for.<p>This leads into how Bowles sells the other argument short: he conflates <i>design</i> and <i>graphic design</i> when he address the &quot;Android is hard to design for&quot; argument. Design is, to borrow a famous phrasing, <i>how it works.</i> Sure, it was tough to do good graphic design for Gingerbread and it&#x27;s much easier now. Great. However, the fragmentation and glacially-slow upgrades have a real cost here - to design the same <i>functionality,</i> may require spanning multiple API versions. The comparison to the diversity of Web browsers and viewers doesn&#x27;t work because that diversity, relies on web standards. The equivalent of web standards that would allow an Android app to do responsive design in the manner of a web app, devices don&#x27;t have or respect.<p>Fundamentally, it seems like Bowles doesn&#x27;t get that the answer to his question is &quot;because doing good design work on Android is more expensive and people pay less for it.&quot; Sure, you could ask designers to make speculative investments in Android, but I suspect that&#x27;ll go about as well as asking people to make speculative investments of their professional time and skill usually goes. Professionals who respect their own time and worth, go where they can do good work and get paid well for it. Currently, that means they don&#x27;t go to Android.",1395637085

7456794,comment,7455828,7455828,1,0,csense,,,"Because in order to decide which is best, you need some criteria for success.  You also need to consider the application and hardware.<p>E.g. if sorting 16-bit or smaller integers, the best algorithm is to build a histogram in a single pass, then expand it again.  That&#x27;s assuming PC/laptop/smartphone hardware, if you are programming a microcontroller you may not have enough memory available.<p>Some applications want sorting to be a one-shot deal.  Other applications want a dynamic data structure that maintains sorted order -- this is the binary tree.  If the things you are sorting are very large and hence stored on disk instead of in memory, you may remember that disk hardware must fetch a whole sector to fetch one byte, having larger tree nodes can be a win because you gain when it makes the tree flatter, but the loss you pay doesn&#x27;t matter because when reading a anything from the disk, you get the whole sector it&#x27;s in for no additional cost.  These are called B-trees and are very popular in database implementations.<p>If your hardware architecture demands the indices of the things you&#x27;re comparing must be fixed (i.e. you&#x27;re not allowed to use the data to decide which array slots need to be compared), you want a sorting network.  This applies to designing sorting hardware, and is also used in programming sorts on GPU&#x27;s.<p>At least one other poster&#x27;s noted that caches on modern hardware give mergesort a strong advantage over quicksort.",1395637043

7456791,comment,7455757,7456442,2,0,danjayh,,,"That works both ways, though -- I went through college from 2000-2004, and aside from some brief forays into other languages (Ruby and Perl, from what I remember) we were taught exclusively in C.  I had some VB experience (self-taught) from middle school, but in my day job we exclusively use C and Ada ... and I&#x27;d never really had reason to learn another language.  A few years back, I decided that I should learn some new languages for a) fun, and b) the diversity that I&#x27;d need if I ever wanted out of my industry.  I taught myself Java, and then the Android framework.  Then C# and VB .net.  What really forced me to start learning new stuff was teaching - I started teaching as an adjunct at a local college after work (the only favor that getting my MS has ever done me), and then I had learn stuff to fit with their curriculum.  Anyway, my point is that it&#x27;s just as easy for older people to be oblivious to new tech as it is for young people to have a complete lack of understanding of fundamentals.  I actually teach binary number formats, boolean algebra, virtual machine code, etc. to my students just to make sure that they&#x27;re not completely unprepared ... and I will say that your point is valid - many of them have had no prior exposure.",1395637003

If a single OS ends up running >90% of the world’s connected devices, why bother writing software for the browser?<p>I can&#x27;t agree here. I think the OS world will be fragmented for a very long time (forever) and that the browser world will always have a core set of functionality to write apps once that run everywhere. I don&#x27;t think Android, iOS, or the desktop browser are going anywhere fast, and so the only platform you can write for that reaches all three is the browser.<p>I suppose the author is predicting the end of desktops/laptops being relevant but even given that (which I don&#x27;t think will ever happen) there will still be iOS and Android. That&#x27;s still double the work to release one app on both. People will always try to find the common denominator and the browser is it (even if in another incarnation, e.g., Cordova/PhoneGap).<p>And assuming Android beats iOS, I can&#x27;t imagine it beats the WWW too. I&#x27;d like to see a statistical breakdown of &quot;native&quot; apps with embedded browsers vs actual native apps. And if Cordova simply won&#x27;t ever offer an elegant enough user experience, then I think Firefox OS will become the winner. The WWW is just so much bigger than Objective C or Dalvik, no one&#x27;s going to port all that. So, even assuming that one OS rules >90% of devices, what percent of existing webapps/websites is that? And what percent of existing mobile apps&#x27; tech stacks is that, accounting for apps that are seemingly native but actually built on web tech?",1395636127

In most practical cases, however, one does not know the corresponding measure from which the data was generated (and will be generated in future). The old school thinking was that one should estimate the generating distribution, and then solve for the optimal decision, based on the estimate. Vapnik showed that it is far better to do it directly without bothering to estimate the distribution which in itself is a non-trivial problem.<p>So (ii) is the more interesting case that machine learners care to handle and Vapnik&#x27;s was one of the first breakthrough fundamental result in this formalism. It applies to all algorithms that does something called structural risk minimization, not just one specific algorithm. His bound applies to all generating distributions, all samples, and all structural risk minimization algorithms ! However in this set up we still  need to assume independence. Some form of independence, even in  some weak form needs to be present. But it is quite remarkable that you can give guarantees on performance <i>regardless</i> of what actual distribution generated the data. I should also mention Leslie Valiant. Lookup PAC learning you will understand the basic premise of this style. One genuine criticism is that it is overly conservative (and it has to be, because it is giving guarantees that applies for the worst distribution, worst training sample, worst algorithm...).<p>(iii) Removes the need for independent draws. If you want to read up on these, search for &quot;regret minimization.&quot; In this setup the guarantees hold for all sequence of data, even if adversarially generated by someone who knows the algorithm you will employ. Some geometric assumptions are necessary on the domain and some function analytic ones on the function that you are trying to minimize (typically convex. Non-differentiable functions are allowed).<p><pre><code>   -- Shalizi&#x27;s Review --\n</code></pre>\nShalizi writes good stuff but this review of Vapnik&#x27;s book is surprisingly mean spirited. The field of course has progressed after Vapnik and there are legitimate criticisms that one can raise, but the review exhibits bad form, I think. Prior to Vapnik there were very few results that one could state outside of the statistical physics community (that worked with strong assumptions, typically Gaussian noise etc)<p><pre><code>    -- Aside --\n</code></pre>\nNo you did not say the word &quot;yo bitches&quot; but that was  the attitude you demonstrated.

There is a huge difference between showing that minimizing a particular function has nice properties and actually coming up with a piece of code to efficiently minimize such a function, not just in theory where constants can be conveniently swept under the rug, but also in practice. So dont be too quick to dismiss the &quot;naive coders&quot;.<p>Most importantly, practice, almost always precedes explanation and analysis in engineering.

I faced a lot of issues when transitioning my server from non-backup to backup mode. To do that, you need to take a snapshot(server shutdown is required for this)of server. Then, you need to destroy it to get the same ip. There is  a chance that your ip may go to someone else & any services that are dependent on ip may need changes. I was lucky to loose the ip for a while & get it back after some trial & error.<p>Also, you don&#x27;t have any control on the backup. It is taken by the system and is supposed to be anywhere between 2-3 days.",1395635268

Talent <i>does</i> increase with age, at least if the developers in question actually care enough to stay current. [1] I don&#x27;t think it gets better by orders of magnitude, though -- the mythical 10x-20x programmer starts out as a 5x+ programmer. I know I was already at least that much better than most of my coworkers when I got my first day job.<p>What <i>does</i> happen is that developers are less willing to work crazy amounts of overtime just to impress management, and it&#x27;s <i>overtime bias</i> that&#x27;s the real problem.<p>I just blew away a team of two developers (both much younger) who had been working on a project for 9+ man weeks, catching up and passing them in less than two calendar weeks of development (on an implementation of the same code on another platform). And I did it in 30-40 hours per week. At a &quot;traditional&quot; company that rates performance by the number of hours each developer sits at their desks, I would have been the <i>worst</i> performer, and it&#x27;s only the fact that I was doing almost exactly the same thing as the other team that made it clear I was getting more work done in less than half the work hours.<p>The corollary is that, as a young programmer, I cost the same as an idiot who couldn&#x27;t put two lines of code together without creating three bugs, but I was <i>already</i> at least 5x as productive as that idiot (well, infinitely more productive than <i>some</i> developers I knew back then...). But now I have a track record and I make a lot more money; if I&#x27;m as good as 3-5 typical programmers, 3-5x the average starting salary is a bargain (considering reduced overhead, management, and increased chance of project completion because of reduced complexity).<p>But most companies don&#x27;t recognize that, so they&#x27;d rather hire and manage 3-5 young developers for &quot;cheap&quot; who are willing to work lots of overtime. If they get at least <i>one</i> who&#x27;s good, they may get more than their money&#x27;s worth. Otherwise they&#x27;re likely to end up with a project that&#x27;s late, has tons of preventable security issues, and that is harder to extend than if they&#x27;d hired the expert.<p>That&#x27;s what&#x27;s broken. As to how to fix it: Would be wonderful if there were some verifiable way to rate programming skill, but until someone comes up with a system that can&#x27;t be gamed, I don&#x27;t see how.<p>[1] I&#x27;ve known many developers who effectively &quot;give up&quot; on learning new things at some point, and from that point on their skills rot (and/or they become managers). The ones who keep learning don&#x27;t seem to hit a &quot;skill wall&quot;, at least into their 50s, where my sample size drops precipitously.",1395634137

If it had lasted more than one or two days, or if I had a temperature higher than 102, then I would have gone.  But as it was, nobody ever knew that I had the flu except myself and my family.<p>Even if I had wanted to go to the doctor for every time I got a flu or a cold, it takes at least a day or two to schedule a doctor&#x27;s appointment.  By the time the appointment had rolled around I would probably have cancelled, since the flu doesn&#x27;t usually last very long.<p>This being the US, there are also a lot of uninsured people who can&#x27;t go to the doctor even if they wanted to.  For those people, Google is the only option.  The CDC can collect as much data as it wants from the laboratories, but you can&#x27;t collect what isn&#x27;t there.<p>When you add in the uninsured people and the people who get better before visiting the doctor, it&#x27;s not at all surprising that the lab estimates are 2x lower than reality.

Layer2 networking architectures like this need to finally die off, as they are extremely complex and difficult to troubleshoot.<p>For high-availability HAProxy I&#x27;ve found ECMP to be by far the most simple way to achieve very reliable redundancy, with a side benefit of more or less infinite horizontal scaling (depending on what routers you&#x27;re talking to).  I&#x27;ve served hundreds of gigabits with this model, and it works well.  You can even scale it out on a global level by utilizing anycasting.<p>It works pretty simple.  Run bgpd on your HAProxy boxes talking to your router.  Each HAProxy box advertises your VIP, and your router will load balance this via ECMP.  Should a HAProxy machine die, the BGP announcement gets withdrawn and traffic flows to the remaining proxy servers still advertising the VIP.<p>The only thing left to do is get some sort of service monitoring going that can automatically down bgpd should haproxy die/otherwise mess up on an individual machine.  Add a couple checks in to ensure there is always a &quot;path of last resort&quot; should you have a bug in your app or monitoring code, and this proves to be very resilient, scalable, and is something nearly anyone can troubleshoot in a very short amount of time.  It also works well in a cloud type on-demand/devops model - as it&#x27;s extremely easy to simply spin up additional haproxy machines and have them automatically announce their configuration via bgpd.",1395633985

74153,comment,73972,73972,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"The only one I've used is ZODB.  The database was fine, I guess, but the Zope stack is huge and scary.<p>I can say that when it came time to move things to another non-Zope system (a pile made up of trac, Moin Moin, Virtualmin, and other bits and pieces), it was painful to the point of ridiculousness.  I'm sure ZODB masters can write middleware for that sort of thing without pain (and if you're building your system that uses the ODB from scratch, you'll probably understand it well enough to do so).  But I'll stick with standard cubbies in which to shove my things from now on (standard, to me, means flat files or an SQL database, as requirements dictate).",1193741022

And there are some OOs around that do a pretty good job of the second item (cayenne but I'm looking for one . I have had great experiences with using business logic layers around cayenne and have been able to rapidly refactor to achieve major schema changes like this.<p>Having said that - the allegro graph stuff looks like it might be a good alternative.<p>I'm currently interested in the idea of using couchdb while getting an app set up and then switching to postgresql later.

Tethering will cost them capacity they aren't billing to anyone. Sort of how like you can get in trouble for using a residential cable modem in a business--consumers get a price break and power users pay more.<p>> Connecting your phone to your computer as a modem is a standard feature for all other phones.<p>Not totally true, the iPhone is just now getting this in the upcoming 3.0 release for example. Many times tethering requires a more expensive data plan with the carrier and that may turn out to be the case with both Android and iPhone.",1238550902

Everyone is on it, yet significant (public company esque) profits have yet to materialize.  It is definitely a social phenomenon, but unlike eBay and Yahoo monetizing the service is proving to be difficult at very large scales.<p>Theres also the problem of advertising on a social networking site.  If we could observe everyone in that US Airways lounge's average Facebook session, how many ads would we see people click on out of that group?  How many people brought something or signed up for something after clicking those ads?  Advertising dynamics on a social networking site are fundamentally different.  A question I always ask people when the topic of Facebook comes up is ""have you ever clicked an ad on there?  I don't think I have"" and the answer is always some variation of ""actually, now that I think about it I haven't"".  I'm not going to extrapolate too much on this given my sample size, but if this is the standard response to this question everywhere, then Facebook has a serious problem (despite its phenomenon status).",1238550902

I feel like the potential is there, but it's is barely touched, and I'm not sure why.<p>Facebook's value is in moving toward mobile. They are ubiquitous enough where the chances of having Facebook in your local area is very high if you're a user yourself.<p>Given all of Twitter's hype, I feel Facebook could easily crush them. While Twitter's monetization strategy is also, of course, questionable, the two companies are tapping into a paradigm shift that has value that isn't quite fully understood.<p>Imagine people using Twitter, but with the richness of Facebook's content. While Twitter's 140-character limit was intentional, it's ultimately a limitation, since Facebook users utilize the service very much in the same way. Above all, though, Facebook knows profile information about you and your friends. It can not only serve ads based on what it knows about you, but where you are, and who is around you.<p>Facebook should ultimately strive to be the omnipresent social tool. There is undeniable value and opportunity for expansion in this. They have the user base, they just need to encourage people to use it in new ways. Twitter seems to be moving toward this, yet there is a huge difference between Twitter's user base (6M last I heard) and Facebook's (150M last I heard).",1238550619

If they were, another company would have replaced them by now.<p>There are numerous companies that can replace the big auto companies. Toyota and Honda has been slowly replacing GM is most of the world markets (including the US). If either GM goes into bankruptcy and gets split up/sold off (e.g. Opel gets sold etc...). It would not be a bad thing.<p>> Setting up an operation of that magnitude requires decades of experience and huge capital expenditures.<p>Setting up a car manufacturer is not that impossible in the market. Over the past years there were 10s of new car manufacturers that started (and some failed). A good example is some Chinese companies such as GWM, Cherry.

You might want to try the Rails Guide instead (<a href=""http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html</a>)<p>From there, I picked up Ruby for Rails (<a href=""http://www.manning.com/black/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.manning.com/black/</a>).  I read about 20% of this book.  It was critical for me understanding the ""magic"" behind Rails and the weird syntax behind Ruby.  I came from a somewhat CS background, so YMMV.<p>After that, I left the books behind.  I just found problems and tried solving them with Ruby & Ruby on Rails.

You may have to be patient, but the people there are super smart and super helpful.<p>---------------------------<p>Through a combination of self taught Ruby on Rails programming and putting myself in professional situations with room for programming growth, I have been incredibly successful.

I use WebKit nightlies which are very fast, and passes the most Acid3 tests right now. ;) The latest additions for :nth-child are a godsend and I can't wait for it to be implemented elsewhere. (No more odd/even classes!) Since I'm on an old iBook, the speed difference between Safari and Firefox is amazing. I don't know if Apple's cheating or Gecko is just unoptimized for the PowerPC.<p>Note that both like to eat RAM like no tomorrow. I haven't found a decent one that doesn't like 256MB+ after an hour's browsing.",1205030989

Opening Firefox would take two minutes or more (just to load the tabs). Same goes for Opera and all the other browsers. IE is built right into Windows so it already has all the necessary components loaded.",1205030753

I'll just add a quick one - Ubuntu doesn't enable subpixel smoothing on fonts automatically, and if you're using LCD displays it's a nice thing to have.<p>You can find this option in System->Preferences->Appearance, Fonts tab.",1205030038

(I know nothing about Rails, but I wondered whether it might be related to their inability -- if it's not just refusal -- to add a feature that their users, judging by the forums when I was evaluating, were clamoring for.)<p>I was frustrated by the 37s attitude. ""We don't comment on development plans"" was a common refrain from their staff. So... no hints on where you're heading or whether there's any plan to add a feature I so desperately need? And the focus on simplicity over suitability to customer needs was also surprising.<p>""Use it or don't"" seems to be their take on customer relations. It's their business and they can run it how they want and, yes, I can think of lots of rationalizations for the way they do things, but they're not a company I want to do business with. Maybe, as an earlier poster wrote, 92% of their customers are happy. I wonder how many potential customers they've lost.<p>Maybe it's a good thing: It leaves a place in the market for a better product, and maybe a better company.",1205029779

That said, there are times when I need them to run full bore without the fan on, say when I'm mixing audio, so here is the fix...<p>Before you get the computer cranked up, put on shorts. Place the laptop on your bare legs with plenty of skin contact area. Now as the computer needs to dissipate heat it can send it straight into your legs where your advanced mammalian temperature control system can easily dissipate it. My G4 powerbook never turns on a fan in this configuration even saturating the CPU for long periods.<p>The disturbing part, is that I always expected cyborgs to come about for benefit of humans, instead I'm donating my body to serve the computer.",1205029615

If I am joining a startup as a founder (or early employee with lots of equity), I will buy my own laptop, otherwise you are just being cheap.<p>3. That guy is smart.  There might be legal ramification with doing personal work on work equipment.  So, he wanted to keep his personal and work equipment separate (or maybe he had too much porn on his personal one, who knows).",1205028028

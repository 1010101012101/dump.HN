Anyway, poling is fine if it's initiated by a user action or it's a vary limited number of systems but if you have a few million users you can't uses it per user. As to reading old log's that's a trivially parallizable problem see database replication for some hints.  So you separate the active messaging that automatically adds new Tweets to a user’s cell phone from the way users read old messages with the webpage and your home free.<p>PS: Text is cheep EX: Slashdot is running off of ~4 computers.  And bandwidth is not a scaling issue until you need a single system to handle more than ~1GB of bandwidth per second.  (Saturating an OC-3 line costs a lot of money but you don't need to change your architecture to do so.)",1210081979

When I was freelancing, I was surprised by just how much non-billable overhead time I had (at least 5-10 hours a week when working with 3 clients). To reduce overhead, work with as few clients as possible. But you'll run into dead time that way, since jobs don't start on a dime.<p>I know a guy who has freelanced for 5 years and kept meticulous records. He knows what he's doing, but says every year he tops out at about 60% of his time being billable. Make sure you factor that into your rate.<p>It's really easy to take your rate and multiply by 40, thinking that's your weekly salary. This is pretty much never the case.<p>Also, don't forget taxes.",1210080644

Remember that you cannot get eight billable hours out of an eight hour day.<p>As a ""consultant"" you are running a business.  Asking other people how much your rates should be is not a business question, that is a programmers question.  You are asking like this is some sort of algorithm you can plug into your code.  You need to tweak your mindset a bit.<p>Edit: How to get consulting work.<p>Build your brand and visibility.  Pick a community (get a bonus for picking one frequented by paying clients) and establish yourself as an authority.  Create an open source project which you can point to which shows you know what you are doing.<p>Network!  The area in which I am has more work than there are people available yet there is likely no shortage of people who would love to break in.  The reason for this paradox is that I only work with people in my network.<p>All the freelancers I know are overworked.

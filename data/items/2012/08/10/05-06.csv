Neurons don't usually differentiate. So instead, cancerous neuronal cells are commonly used (neuroblastoma cells). Basically, these neuronal cells have decided to divide rapidly. You simply place these cells in a serum of growth medium consisting of protein, sugars, and salts and watch them divide over the course of a few days.<p>It would be nice to use stem cells instead or cancerous cells... but that is another thread entirely.",1344578363

Their p-values are explained very badly, so I did my own analysis by transcribing their data from those plots.  Let's take their weighting scheme for granted.  I agree with some other commenters that the sums and counts are misleading, and instead took average scores per font, and computed confidence intervals for those means.  The means are indeed a little different, and for some pairs, statistically significantly so.<p><a href=""http://brenocon.com/Screen%20shot%202012-08-10%20at%202.03.07%20AM.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brenocon.com/Screen%20shot%202012-08-10%20at%202.03.0...</a><p>But does it matter much?  Take the pair with the largest gap, Baskerville vs. Comic Sans, of 0.95 versus 0.79: a difference is 0.16.  This is out of a 10-point scale (ranging -5 to +5).<p>In fact, the standard deviation for the entire dataset is 3.6 -- so just 0.05 standard deviations worth of difference.<p>Or here's another way to think about it.  If a person does Comic Sans example, versus could have done Baskerville example, how often would they have score higher?  (This ignores the weightings, it's a purely ordinal comparison.  I think this is related to the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test statistic or something, I forget.)  So with independence assumptions (if they had proper randomization, hopefully this solves), just independently sample from the distributions many times and compare pairs of simulated outcomes.  22% of the time it's a tie, 40.3% of the time Baskerville scores higher, and 37.8% of the time Comic Sans scores higher.  I guess then it sounds like the difference is better than nothing.<p>Not sure what's a good and fair way to think about the substantive size of the effect.  I wanted to take the quantile positions of the means, but realized you can't exactly do that with ordinal data like this (zillions of values share the same quantile value).<p>I probably missed something, so here's the transcribed data and R/Python code probably with errors: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/3311340"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/3311340</a><p>Now that I'm thinking about it more, averaging the agreement scores seems weird.

I do ask questions which are taught in decent CS courses, but I couldn't care less, if the answer is right, about where it came from. Degree is just a piece of paper, it is knowledge and skills that matter.<p>I have a CS degree and I think it gave me a lot and helped a lot in my professional advancement. However, this way of learning is not for everybody, and I do see how somebody could have acquired the same knowledge and skills without any formal framework. I probably could not - and I know that if I join any formal framework, even free no-commitment one like Coursera - I learn much more effectively than if I just try to do it by myself. But for many people it is the opposite, and these people can be and often are more successful than I am.<p>So formal education is <i>very</i> useful - for some. For some it is not, so I completely understand why OP thinks it was his biggest mistake and I think he has made the right decision for him. I'd suggest him to try some free education though - like Coursera or many other major colleges have now free online course. You don't get the degree, but you do get the knowledge, and that's IMHO much more valuable.<p>OTOH, the formal degree may also be usable for some big companies and some other things (e.g. immigration, for those that want to live in different country than they were born in) - but one can do without it too.",1344577520

How gauche!<p>Of course, now with the recession on, a whole lot more people find it impossible to pretend to not be poor, and actually taking steps to see to it that you can feed yourself later in life are gaining some social acceptance.<p>Personally, I'd say that I learned a very similar lesson to the barista when I bought a BMW during the first dot-com.  You see, pretending to be rich is really expensive.",1344576957

I pretty much did that when I was in school, and I had about a 60% chance of an A and a 30% chance of a B, according to my GPA.<p>I wasn't quite as quick as the poster -- the total amount of effort I put into a course probably amounted to 2-3 days of work, including time spent in classes and exams. But, I knew people who were easily an order of magnitude more productive than I was; for them, it would have been an afternoon of work. If you read quickly, you can finish reading a textbook in an afternoon. The extra time I burned was the time it took to work through enough exercises to convince myself that I really got the material. For some really easy classes, I only had to do one exercise per section to convince myself that I knew it, so it ended up being just one afternoon. There are plenty of people who are smarter than I am, who could do every class that way. I don't know if the writer of the original article is one of those people, but it doesn't sound implausible to me.<p>Just for reference, I went to Wisconsin, which is approximately as rigorous as RIT, and I double majored in math and computer engineering, which are both comparable to CS. But, I graduated in three years and my tuition was a few thousand a year, so the total was was easily covered by an engineering internship. At a place like Wisconsin, you might as well stick around and get the degree -- after all, it's only a month or two of total effort, and you can easily make enough to cover the degree from doing internships, or working as an RA on campus or even at Starbucks. If the price tag were $44k a year, I probably would have dropped out, too.",1344576925

I got a distinct feeling that the author of this blog is in deep passionate love with himself and his writing, and the topic he is writing about is remote secondary to the flourish of his expression. I personally don't care too much about this flourish, when I get craving for it, I can read classic authors that tell real stories about fascinating things in great language and not a bit of snobbery about some geeks naming their companies wrong. When I read technical or around-technical article, I expect a decent command of English, but I expect the author to worry about delivering his point and not about loving his own voice so much that he can't stop embellishing and loses he sight of why he's doing it. Reporting and opera aria are different genres.<p>In this article, what is the point of it? That all startup ideas suck because they think too small? And the author instead thinks they should be doing... well, he doesn't. He just thinks they are named wrong, think wrong, dress wrong, speak wrong, live wrong and their future is wrong. Everything is wrong except for the one shining light that is the author of the article and his perfect whimsical metaphor-filled style. Bleh.",1344574987

He was doing stuff like the above, but also getting around the callback as well (I don't recall exactly what he did, but it was something along the lines of conning the line workers to divert an exec's phone number for testing purposes just long enough to get the callback).  That was just one of many times he pulled these sorts of stunts for curiousity's sake.",1344574931

And why does it matter anyway if my clothing accurately reflects some abstract startup ethos?   Startups talk about attracting women, but what happens when women get criticized for doing things a lot of us legitimately enjoy like wearing pretty clothes?<p>Either way, nothing is less business-like than judging a tech event by the attire of the participants. In tech, it's a lose-lose situation. Dress in a baggy Defcon t-shirt and don't brush your hair...you are too ugly and you must not be a ""people person."" Dress nicely...oh you must have just chosen those clothes to impress people, so you must be superficial.",1344574860

If you have enough employees, and you're covering an relatively small risk, you don't need to /buy/ anything at all. You just self-insure and you save a ton of money relative to what an insurance company would charge for the same coverage.<p>I've worked at several large companies where almost all of the insurance (health, life, etc) was done on a self-insured basis, with an insurance company providing providing administrative oversight (validating claims) for a flat fee. (But not actually providing insurance coverage.) If necessary, a company can buy reinsurance to cover claims above some (very, very high) deductible, the same way that your insurance company does.<p>And the reason why large companies do this is that, in fact, they do get a lot more bang for the buck than any of their employees could as individual consumers.",1344574856

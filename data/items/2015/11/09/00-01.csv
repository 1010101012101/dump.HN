The issue is that intelligence (which is required to be an intellectual) is an <i>intrinsically desirable trait</i>, meaning that someone who is smart (even if they are nothing else) is often seen as more desirable or worth more than a less smart individual. More importantly, having this position implies leadership. If you&#x27;re going to propose solutions, you&#x27;re not very good at your job if no one is actually listening to you. And since we value leaders over followers, it follows that intellectuals are considered more valuable.<p>This means that calling someone an intellectual doesn&#x27;t just define them as &quot;someone who studies society and proposes solutions for its problems&quot; - it defines them as someone who has <i>insight</i> regarding society and proposes <i>worthwhile</i> solutions for its problems.<p>This makes things weird. I can still call a shitty artist an artist. I can still call a shitty programmer a programmer. But when I call someone an intellectual, it&#x27;s making a <i>positive judgment</i> regarding his ideas. After all, a shitty intellectual is just a guy with stupid ideas. And who am I, Omegaham, a random electron microscope technician from Oregon, to say that Noam Chomsky or Thomas Sowell has worthwhile ideas? I mean, I have opinions, but saying so definitively is way above my pay grade.<p>As a result, the term is so screwed up by connotation that I tend to use &quot;intellectual&quot; exactly the same as you - sarcastically. For me, an &quot;intellectual&quot; is &quot;someone who would call himself an intellectual,&quot; with all of the misguided arrogance that doing so implies.",1447030770
10530847,comment,10523417,10528263,0,0,JohnTHaller,,,"When Texas Instruments exited, it&#x27;s likely neither Google nor anyone else had the proper legal agreements in place to force the release or licensing of the appropriate code/patents to ensure continued updates.  After this rather large debacle which affected numerous manufacturers in the mobile industry, I&#x27;d wager that&#x27;s now part of all of them.<p>Don&#x27;t forget that even without an exit, sometimes OEMs don&#x27;t update drivers, leaving manufacturers to drop support far earlier than they should in the lifespan of a product.  Case in point, the 2008 Apple Macbook.  It only had 32-bit graphics drivers. So, that meant it couldn&#x27;t run the 64-bit-only OS X Mountain Lion released just 4 years later in 2012.  I found this all out firsthand supporting my girlfriend&#x27;s problematic 2008 Macbook (which also had notoriously bad connections to the LCD panel).",1447030675

(However, having that separate internal format for data may well be a better way to go, in general.)<p>The algebraic approach, in this context, is similar to a superclass naming its subclasses (rather than a subclass naming its superclasses as java does). I&#x27;m not sure, but I suspect this open-world choice is deliberate, allowing extensibility. Java is very attentive to security considerations elsewhere. It also would be a too-dramatic change for mainstream OO programming languages.<p>A third approach is explicitly closed-world: naming the set of classes permitted for deserialization, as per some other commenters.  e.g. JAXB does this by necessity, for binding to XML Schema&#x27;s algebraic type system.",1447030559

These days, the difference between a startup salary and a Google salary might be something like $125k vs $150k -- and $125k is already enough money for taking vacations or having a down payment after 5-10 years of saving.

10530664,comment,10529269,10529269,0,0,Mz,,,"I was one of the top students in my graduating high school class, but was sexually abused as a kid. I spent a lot of years in therapy and generally trying to deal with my personal issues. At one time, I wanted to go into some kind of &quot;helping&quot; profession and considered psychology and social work.<p>I&#x27;m a woman and I CLEPed college algebra when I returned to college in my early thirties. I decided that with a relatively strong math background, I could do whatever the hell interested me and that becoming successful as a woman was the best thing I could do to try to make the world a better place. I could set the example instead of going into a helping field and this would be a better thing to do. The desire to go into a helping field was posited on the idea that the world was as broken as I had been at one time and people needed my pity and needed help.<p>My understanding of the problem space changed and I decided that oppressed and downtrodden need opportunity more than they need help. I still like helping people and I still want to do things that will help folks who are having a rough time, but my framing of how best to do that has changed dramatically.<p>I will suggest that a lot of people who go into psychology do so because they fundamentally view the world as broken and people as crapped on by the system and cannot imagine the system actually changing in any meaningful fundamental way.<p>I have had a class on <i>Homelessness and Public Policy.</i> I am currently homeless. I am abundantly familiar with the kinds of personal challenges that land an individual on the street. I am strongly opposed to writing people off as incapable of ever getting their act together just because things are really bad currently. I am strongly opposed to the idea that we need a system in place for being permanently &quot;helpful&quot; in a way that actively makes it harder for people to get their lives together themselves.<p>I run a website aimed at helping homeless people preserve their agency while trying to resolve what are typically very serious problems. On the other hand, I also am very clear that systemic problems like the high cost of housing can be relatively readily resolved by moving someplace cheaper. I did so in May and I am in the midst of writing a blogpost today about the fact that where I currently am is a lot cheaper and levels of homelessness per capita appear to be lower.<p>People who live on limited incomes, like retirement money, may be poorly positioned to increase their income in order to keep up with rising housing costs, but if they move someplace cheaper, their lives may suddenly work a whole lot better.<p>Being on the street should not be a reason to write someone off permanently. It is really not healthy for society for us to be taking that position. We should be doing all in our power to help people keep their agency and maintain their independence -- even people with mental health issues. It is possible to have serious mental health issues and still manage your life on your own. In fact, the more someone can manage their life on their own, the more they are empowered to conquer the root causes of their mental health issues, which either have chemical or social roots (or both). Having agency can help one get on top of that, regardless of the root cause.<p>Edit: Finished my blog post: <a href=""http://sandiegohomelesssurvivalguide.blogspot.com/2015/11/the-cheap-seats.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sandiegohomelesssurvivalguide.blogspot.com/2015/11/th...</a>",1447027647

I strongly suspect you&#x27;d prefer the latter, even though the median for that scenario is $0.<p>$100 or $490 or $1000 isn&#x27;t really enough to make a meaningful difference in my life decisions, so I&#x27;ll take the higher-expected-value option, simply because the money is strictly bonus. If I want to plan with the money, though, I want the lower-risk option.<p>In particular, compare a $90K + equity salary with a $120K + no equity one, where there&#x27;s a small chance that the equity is worth well over $100K in three years. With the higher salary, if I want to spend it now, I can get an apartment closer to work, I can visit my family more or take more vacation, etc. Alternatively, if I save it, I can take a year off of work and fund my own work, I can put a down payment on a house, etc.<p>It&#x27;s certainly true that if I win the equity game, I can take well over a year off of work, I can put a larger down payment on a better house, etc. But if I don&#x27;t, I have to keep working and living in an apartment. And since I have no guarantee of it, I certainly can&#x27;t spend that expected value now. From the purpose of planning, if I actively want to do one of these things in three years, I&#x27;d rather have a guarantee of being able to do it somehow, than a chance of being able to do it very well and a chance of nothing.<p>Once I have a guarantee of being able to buy a house in three years, I can do things like plan to start a family then. If I have such a goal in mind, it&#x27;s <i>clearly</i> better to choose the lower-risk thing, if it provides enough money to enable this sort of long-term planning.<p>$100 vs. $490 will hardly make any difference to how many people I can invite to the wedding.",1447027568

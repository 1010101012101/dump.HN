127458,comment,127400,127400,0,0,mk,,,"Mine is self-hosted using wordpress.It works, but I am always tempted to write my own just because I want more control over the app. The templates that use widgets are nice and wordpress has a lot of nice plugins, but it just isn't the same. I used blogger a couple years ago and didn't like it much. That being said I would have to agree with andr that if it was not a personal blog and my startups blog I would host it elsewhere. You want someplace where you have some sort of communication with your users about what is going on in the event of the site going down. Oh I also have a tumblr account but don't really use it for blogging. I just wanted to check out the features. For the most part it is pretty cool and I could see where a really nice microblogging solution could be built off of something similar.",1204480351

127454,comment,127433,127441,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"Showing all the territories, as they expand and contract, would be much more information. Also, the smooth growth of empires just isn't the way it happens. The quick snaps of change would be both more accurate and dramatic.<p>The time constant is an interesting aspect. If it were tunable, you might get bored in the past and overwhelmed as time progressed to modernity.<p>Globally, it would be interesting to see colonization through the end of the cold war.<p>Another interesting map might be a heat map of home prices over an area like NYC's 5 boroughs. Lots of people treat gentrification like some kind of war, so using a similar visualization would be appropriate.<p>Another map that would be interesting, even over the same time period and region, is total or per capita wealth within an empire. The best visualization would involve the area of the territory shrinking or growing like these scaled cartograms:

And if you do know what most of them were, it's fascinating to see things usually covered in different books all together one after another.<p>The main fault I'd find with this is that time doesn't flow at a constant rate.

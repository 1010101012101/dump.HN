However, if that&#x27;s how all humans were, it wouldn&#x27;t be defined as a disease, it would just be human nature.<p>It&#x27;s also about human performance in very specific environments, that being certain industrial and early-post-industrial environments. And I&#x27;ll add that most humans have inadequate attentional mechanisms for those environments, which is why 80% of adult Americans consume attention-enhancing stimulants every day, and why it is extremely rare to find an office environment without ready caffeine.<p>One caveat: there are a variety of things that get lumped under the term ADD, like organophosphate pesticide poisoning [1]. There are people with severe attentional issues who do indeed suffer, and would even in historical human environments. Here I&#x27;m speaking only of the 5-10% of the population with the standard sort of ADD that appears to be genetic, and wouldn&#x27;t have been recognized as a disease until recently.<p>[1] <a href=""http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2010/06/there_is_no_link_between_adhd.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2010/06/there_is_no_link_betw...</a>",1440982798
10144939,comment,10143563,10144310,0,0,s0lofounder,,,"IS IT NOT a very strange thing in this world, where there is so much distraction, entertainment, that almost everybody is a spectator and very few are players? Whenever we have a little free time, most of us seek some form of amusement. We pick up a serious book, a novel, or a magazine. If we are in America we turn on the radio or the television, or we indulge in incessant talk. There is a constant demand to be amused, to be entertained, to be taken away from ourselves. We are afraid to be alone, afraid to be without a companion, without a distraction of some sort. Very few of us ever walk in the fields and the woods, not talking or singing songs, but just walking quietly and observing things about us and within ourselves. We almost never do that because, you see, most of us are very bored; we are caught in a dull routine of learning or teaching, of household duties or a job, and so in our free time we want to be amused, either lightly or seriously. We read, or go to the cinema - or we turn to a religion, which is the same thing. Religion too has become a form of distraction, a kind of serious escape from boredom, from routine.<p>I don&#x27;t know if you have noticed all this. Most people are constantly occupied with something - with puja, with the repetition of certain words, with worrying over this or that - because they are frightened to be alone with themselves. You try being alone, without any form of distraction, and you will see how quickly you want to get away from yourself and forget what you are. That is why this enormous structure of professional amusement, of automated distraction, is so prominent a part of what we call civilization. If you observe you will see that people the world over are becoming more and more distracted, increasingly sophisticated and worldly. The multiplication of pleasures, the innumerable books that are being published, the newspaper pages filled with sporting events - surely, all these indicate that we constantly want to be amused. Because we are inwardly empty, dull, mediocre, we use our relationships and our social reforms as a means of escaping from ourselves. I wonder if you have noticed how lonely most people are? And to escape from loneliness we run to temples, churches, or mosques, we dress up and attend social functions, we watch television, listen to the radio, read, and so on.<p>Do you know what loneliness means? Some of you may be unfamiliar with that word, but you know the feeling very well. You try going out for a walk alone, or being without a book, without someone to talk to, and you will see how quickly you get bored. You know that feeling well enough, but you don&#x27;t know why you get bored, you have never inquired into it. If you inquire a little into boredom you will find that the cause of it is loneliness. It is in order to escape from loneliness that we want to be together, we want to be entertained, to have distractions of every kind: gurus, religious ceremonies, prayers, or the latest novels. Being inwardly lonely we become mere spectators in life; and we can be the players only when we understand loneliness and go beyond it.<p>After all, most people marry ad seek other social relationships because they don&#x27;t know how to live alone. Not that one must live alone; but, if you marry because you want to be loved, or if you are bored and use your job as a means of forgetting yourself, then you will find that your whole life is nothing but an endless search for distractions. Very few go beyond this extraordinary fear of loneliness; but one must go beyond it, because beyond it lies the real treasure.<p>You know, there is a vast difference between loneliness and aloneness. Some of the younger students may still be unaware of loneliness, but the older people know it: the feeling of being utterly cut off, of suddenly being afraid without apparent cause. The mind knows this fear when for a moment it realizes that it can rely on nothing, that no distraction can take away the sense of self-enclosing emptiness. That is loneliness. But aloneness is something entirely different; it is a state of freedom which comes into being when you have gone through loneliness and understand it. In that state of aloneness you don&#x27;t rely on anyone psychologically because you are no longer seeking pleasure, comfort, gratification. It is only then that the mind is completely alone, and only such a mind is creative.<p><a href=""http://www.jiddu-krishnamurti.net/en/think-on-these-things/1963-00-00-jiddu-krishnamurti-think-on-these-things-chapter-23"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jiddu-krishnamurti.net/en/think-on-these-things/1...</a>",1440982787

10144924,comment,10144891,10144891,0,0,vezzy-fnord,,,"Firstly, the age-old canard of microkernels being &quot;too slow for the real world&quot; is decades out of date, and L4 and QNX today are ubiquitous.<p>One should not make the mistake of using the term &quot;init&quot; to refer to a particular implementation. init(8) is simply the first process. There never was a single &quot;Unix init system&quot;, though the BSD rc was always the superior one out of the originals. This is reflected to this day by its ridiculously short init scripts and the fact that a dependency system (rcorder(8)) was easily retrofitted.<p>The issue of boot speed is a misunderstood one. Properly benchmarking and having a deterministic boot process has always been difficult. Linux distros were by and large using the same tricks with sysvinit (startpar, insserv, Makefile-style concurrency, etc.) that systemd centralizes to get the same speed benefits for a while. Further, systemd introduces failure points in the boot process of its own, particularly with how it handles job scheduling and states, the occurrence of dependency loops and so forth. A lack of proper integration (which is still common, it turns out having a full proper systemd-based init configuration is hard [1]) can exacerbate this, and I&#x27;ve had experiences of >2 minute-long booting on Fedora 20.<p>It must be stated that the problem with systemd isn&#x27;t its violating the &quot;Unix way&quot;. The problem is with systemd itself, <i>a priori</i>. It&#x27;s a landmine of an architecture with chronic mission scope issues and lack of proper creative direction.<p>I can also understand why a security researcher like Rob would be wary of systemd. The risks of systemd are indeed exceptionally great compared to previous systems. systemd&#x27;s PID1 handles things like configuration parsing, cgroupfs writing, supervision, system state management, mount/automount points and its coverage is much higher than even something like launchd or Solaris SMF. The central I/O bottleneck of something like the journal (which by far has been the buggiest systemd component) is also noteworthy.<p>[1] <a href=""https://wiki.freedesktop.org/www/Software/systemd/Optimizations/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.freedesktop.org/www/Software/systemd/Optimizati...</a>",1440982205

He makes a clear and succinct point: In a distributed database, managing consistency at scale gets complex because most systems are designed to assume a centralized authority [of consistency]. By removing the centralized authority and making conflict resolution the main mode of operation, the design can (according to the author) be made simpler.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with any of that, and it&#x27;s not a new idea (Lotus Notes and CouchDB come to mind as databases that solve replication through conflict handling), although I&#x27;m not seeing a clear description of how this synchronization algorithm actually works.

Business model design is just as difficult IMO. (He learned this at Pixar positively, and at NeXT negatively. Pixar&#x27;s campus is a great example of business design, along with their deal with Disney.

The reason why we have optical disc and tape robots is that the tape and discs need a separate device that reads/writes them. With hardware there&#x27;s not such need.<p>With hard drives it would make more sense to do some development on the electronics side and build a system where  lots of drives can be simultaneously connected to a small controller computer. All of the HD&#x27;s don&#x27;t need to be powered on or accessible all the time, the controller could turn on only few of them at a time.

But mainly alcohol is very good a taking up the flavour compounds of anything you add to it. This is a really big factor in what makes alcoholic beverages distinct.  Also the fermentation process breaks things down and releases flavour compounds from the thing fermenting in a way that is hard or impossible to get other ways.<p><i>But most alcoholic drinks can be duplicated without any alcohol and taste exactly the same</i><p>If this actually is the case, and I very much doubt it, why hasn&#x27;t anyone done it?  All non-alcoholic wines I&#x27;ve tested on the market today taste quite bad and bear only a passing resemblance to their alcoholic counterparts.  If someone could make a non-alcoholic wine that could hold its own in a blind taste test against a collection of reasonable even just $20 bottles I&#x27;d be be beyond happy.

Some things that have helped me in no particular order:<p>- Get a large (27&quot; in my case) monitor so I can have the text large without having to constantly zoom in. High resolution + higher DPI is easier on the eyes than getting big text by lowering the resolution.<p>- Learn a terminal based text editor (Vim or EMacs) and get good at using the terminal. Many GUI based applications, particularly IDEs have limited options or don&#x27;t work well with larger text sizes. Working within a terminal makes developing less &quot;visual&quot; while maximising the amount of information on screen. Now I spend 80% plus of my day in a terminal and my eyes are significantly less tired at the end of the day.<p>- Use a tiling window manager. On OSX I use Slate (<a href=""https://github.com/jigish/slate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jigish/slate</a>), or on Nix you could use something like XMonad. The screen-snapping stuff in recent versions of Windows is helpful too. The idea here is to rely on the mouse as little as possible.<p>- use a dark color scheme. I like Solarized-dark but there are several other good options.<p>- pick an easy to read font. I use Menlo and have the size up around 32pt.<p>- use a terminal prompt that makes it very clear where the prompt is when scrolling back through history. I use this one <a href=""https://gist.github.com/agnoster/3712874"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/agnoster/3712874</a><p>- get an adjustable monitor arm so you can bring the screen closer to you without craning your neck. I&#x27;ve had the same one for 15+ years but am planning on buying one of the Ergotron ones in the next few weeks<p>- use f.lux to take the bright blue tint out of screen colors <a href=""https://justgetflux.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://justgetflux.com/</a><p>- work in a room lit by lamps positioned so that they don&#x27;t add any glare.<p>- if you often find yourself working at the same screen as other people, set up a second monitor in mirror-mode or investigate using TMux if you&#x27;re both in terminal editors so that you can have your terminal configured so it&#x27;s comfortable for you, and so can your partner.<p>I&#x27;m happy to provide more info on any of this.",1398499650

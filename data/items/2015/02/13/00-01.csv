But in this day and age where people have much more to gain and very little to lose when being assertive and fearless in social situations, anxiety has become an excessive and prehistoric response that is largely irrelevant to the times and culture we live in.<p>Here&#x27;s an example relevant to most men. Why aren&#x27;t we talking to that hot super model at the bar? What do we have to lose? Nothing. What do we have to gain? Everything. The logic is inescapable but why are we still scared? Because in the past hitting on a super hot model meant dealing with her alpha male partner who could kill you in a duel. The emotions we feel are evolutionary relics from prehistoric times that were designed to keep us safe.

9042277,comment,9040023,9040023,0,0,dgreensp,,,"Let&#x27;s extol the virtues of fear and hate, while we&#x27;re at it.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s normal to get anxious sometime, just as it&#x27;s normal to get angry sometimes.  Someone who never, <i>ever</i> gets angry could be suspected of bottling up their feelings (but we can&#x27;t be sure).  Our emotions aren&#x27;t under direct voluntary control, so if we find ourselves getting angry, or anxious, or fearful, we must aim not to freak out, or criticize ourselves for it, or become anxious about our anger, angry about our anxiety, fearful of our fear, or any other such downward spiral.  Emotions are normal; they are ok.<p>However, doing what a negative emotion says to do usually doesn&#x27;t work out as well as doing something else, in my experience.   While we can certainly find evolutionary justifications for the things we feel compelled to do under the influence of these emotions, that doesn&#x27;t mean they are helpful.  Fear tells us to flee, to avoid, to destroy, or to deny.  I&#x27;ve read that highly successful people who seem fearless do feel fear but just aren&#x27;t as bothered by it.  I think this says the exact opposite of the OP&#x27;s message, which in this analogy would be The Importance of Fear: It Tells Us When to Run Away.  The hard part about fear is acknowledging it and not running away.  That is called courage.<p>Similarly, anger.  When you are fighting with your wife (or co-founder), they may say something that you take personally and it hurts your feelings.  You are outraged.  You strike back, and a fight breaks out.  Ok, that&#x27;s fine, that&#x27;s normal.  But one of you, at some point, has to ignore the anger voice that tells you to defend yourself at all costs, and to attack your enemy&#x27;s weaknesses.  Yes, your partner has become your enemy, thanks to anger.<p>Anxious drivers don&#x27;t drive better than non-anxious drivers.  I may have moments of anxiety when I drive, such as if I notice a car about to merge into me and I swerve.  Perhaps the anxiety plays a physiological role in helping me respond.  However, it takes many seconds for the feeling to subside, during which time the anxiety is not helping me, it is hurting me.  It also seems naive to identify the <i>feeling</i> of anxiety with the biochemistry of responding to an urgent situation.  We could just as well say anxiety is a psychological state which is a harmful byproduct of the physiology.",1423788613
9042276,comment,9039903,9041815,0,0,pdonis,,,"What the article is referring to is that de Sitter spacetime, which is an idealized universe that only contains vacuum energy, has no initial singularity; it extends infinitely far back in time (and infinitely far forward as well). This is the basic model (at the classical level--see below) used to describe inflation, so in that sense I think the answer is that the &quot;no singularity&quot; result applies to all inflation theories.<p>That&#x27;s not quite the end of the story, because the idealized model I just referred to is a classical model; it doesn&#x27;t include quantum effects. I think the general opinion among physicists is that, if we extrapolate inflation back far enough, we reach a point where quantum effects become important, and the classical model above no longer applies. I don&#x27;t think anyone expects a quantum model with an initial singularity to replace the classical model in this regime; but at this point we don&#x27;t know what the correct quantum model is.",1423788523

So for example:<p>Erlang introduced lightweight CSP-based concurrency.  Go popularized it.<p>Haskell introduced typeclasses.  Go and Rust popularize them (as interfaces and traits, respectively, the latter also influenced by C++ STL&#x27;s concepts).<p>Cyclone introduced linear types.  Rust popularizes them.<p>Smalltalk introduced object-orientation.  (More precisely, Simula did and Smalltalk took it to its logical conclusion.)  Java, C++, and Objective-C popularized it.<p>Self introduced prototype-based programming.  Javascript popularized it.<p>CLOS (Common Lisp) introduced the meta-object protocol.  Python and Ruby popularized it, particularly in their Django and Rails web frameworks respectively.<p>Usually popularizing a language involves a good deal of work that&#x27;s not sexy, notably building up a large standard library, developer tools, a package manager, and a whole ecosystem around the language.",1423787528

As far as I know, every Japanese citizen must be listed in a koseki.  Your family name is dependent upon the koseki.  When I got married to my Japanese wife, she decided to use my name and since I am a foreigner we had to create a new koseki for our family.  I could just have easily have changed my name to her family name and joined her family&#x27;s koseki.  I didn&#x27;t read the linked article, but I suspect that is what they are referring to as &quot;adoption&quot;.<p>I suppose it is adoption in a way since the person is joining the family, but when you get married one person or the other has to move to the other koseki.  Usually the woman moves, but there are many reasons why a man might be invited to join the woman&#x27;s family instead.  The obvious one is that the family has no male children and therefore nobody to continue the family (if all the female children get married and join other koseki).  Other reasons can include things like the man being an orphan and wanting to join the other family (this is the case of a friend of mine).<p>Note that gay and lesbian couples have hacked the koseki to have a form of marriage.  One of them simply &quot;adopts&quot; the other.  Then they are in the same koseki and legally in the same family.  I don&#x27;t know the details, but I don&#x27;t think this affords all the benefits of marriage, but I think it gets you quite close.<p>The koseki is quite strange when you first get exposed to it, but it is really a simple legal instrument.  There are definite problems, but for the vast majority of Japanese people it works quite well.  The main problems are related to non-citizens.  For example, in my case if I were to divorce from my wife, I would revert to a state where I was not on any koseki.  This would essentially remove a whole raft of rights that I have when I am on a koseki.  You basically aren&#x27;t a legal person unless you are on a koseki.  If I had children, for instance, if I got divorced my wife would automatically get custody because I would not legally be able to take custody, not being a person.  There are apparently some reforms coming down the pipe to handle these corner cases, but like I said the system works quite well for the vast majority of Japanese citizens.",1423787415

The oxide is apparently near useless as a supplement despite being very common, while chelated forms like magnesium glycinate are supposed to be much more bioavailable, and that form in particular doesn&#x27;t seem to cause digestive problems like some other forms do (the citrate is actually marketed as a laxative if I&#x27;m not mistaken).",1423785874

Sure, there were some people who had a Palm or a Windows Mobile phone, but they weren&#x27;t very good. Just like people have hand warmers and electric blankets, which are bulky, inconvenient, and not very good. The the iPhone came along and was slightly better, but better enough that people would take it seriously. Maybe something like the Nest fits that analogy. Then suddenly with a few small tweaks and a change of public mindset, everyone is carrying a 12-hour-battery-life, $700, all-glass smartphone in their pocket, to the point where PCs are being phased out and hardly anyone has a house phone anymore.<p>So what you&#x27;re saying is, we need mainframes and house phones, but maybe we should have cordless phones and network those mainframes together, because the problem of making a smartphone is just too hard.<p>So no, I don&#x27;t think you understand. You know what&#x27;s not <i>convenient</i>? Walking out the door and having my face frozen off by -30F weather. Having an AC unit in the living room where the cold air never reaches my bedroom at night. Bundling up in the winter. Sticking to the leather in the summer. You want to talk about convenience? That doesn&#x27;t sound very convenient at all. That just sounds <i>lazy</i>, because it&#x27;s what we have now. Lazy is not the same as convenient.<p>Do you have a cell phone, or are batteries too inconvenient? With current HVAC systems, you only have them in your house, your office, or your car. I used to have a bag phone in my car that I could plug into the cigarette lighter. But now I can take my phone anywhere. Why can&#x27;t I take my HVAC anywhere?",1423785743

Taking the matatu into town was always a fun experience.  I came just after they implemented strict laws that limited passengers to the number of seatbelts.  This opened up business for a lot more matatu operators but congested the roads.  Before there may be double the number of people per matatu standing or hanging off the sides.<p>It was incredible to me how each matatu basically had its own personality.  Some would be quiet like riding on a normal bus in North America.  But then you would have the party matatus that would be fully painted and blasting out music at 9am in the morning and the tout would be lauging and joking with all the passengers or singing.<p>I was on an exchange program and stayed with host families.  While waiting for matutus to take us into town, even though there were so many, they basically recognized all of them.  I would say, &quot;What about this one?&quot; and they would say that it was going somewhere else or that you can&#x27;t trust them.<p>At night, when coming home there was usually a 30-60 minute lineup just to get on one and then it could take another 60 minutes to get home when the normal time was just 20 minutes.",1423785724

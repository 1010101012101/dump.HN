921556,comment,920704,920704,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I am dubious that such language will appear in any kind of treaty in the future.<p>I'm not calling BoingBoing a liar, but I find it hard to believe that the U.S. is going to pass laws or engage in treaties that destroy some of its greatest companies. Either these provisions are misunderstood, they are proposed amendments that nobody thinks will be in the final language, or they are interpretations by folks looking to sabotage the negotiations. If I had to guess I'd say the latter, but that's just intuition.<p>My call based on one article? Flame bait for nerds.<p>Show me some more sources and we'll see if this develops into something worthy of all the yelling and shouting.<p>Even if this is true -- multi-source, people. It's much too easy for ""leaks"" to be more manipulative in nature when the internet is one big echo chamber.",1257339437
921555,comment,920110,921483,0,0,JoachimSchipper,,,"Hmm, you had not previously expanded on the prevention of impersonation, although that is indeed desirable. In fact, piggybacking this whole thing on PGP (with special ""is interesting"" messages) may work. Somewhat.<p>I don't see why the web of trust-approach would fail. Certainly, I admit, ""is worth reading"" is not (intended to be) a global value, while ""is really that person"" is.<p>But ultimately the web of trust answers the question ""do <i>I</i> trust that person to be who (s)he says (s)he is"". For instance, someone who trusts a lot of people is likely able to verify that key D5327CB9 belongs to Wietse Venema, while someone who has just created a key but doesn't yet trust anyone cannot. Therefore, while this key belongs to Wietse or does not belong to Wietse irrespective of who asks this question, the answer may differ.<p>There are obvious parallels to ""do I trust this person to produce interesting content/tag appropriately"".<p>I can understand your desire to bring the elite together, but what is the big added value over, say, Twitter or blogs? These are fairly stable, fairly reliable identifiers of people, with connections between them. Filtering out the nonsense is so easy that it's hard to notice that we're even doing it, and ""clusters"" of smart people form more or less automatically. (Which is not to say that either Twitter or blogs are the best possible communication medium, especially for small messages like this, but they seem to get this mostly right.)",1257339388

921522,comment,920488,920775,0,0,mseebach,,,"No, the right lesson is to take a deep breath and ask yourself what three hours of downtime is worth to your business and compare that to the cost of full failover.<p>The cost of full failover is first off a doubling of your hardware and datacenter costs. Then add the cost of developing a software system that can handle seamless failover, as well as testing it. By this I also mean the cost of significantly slower release-cycles, because you're not going to release a new feature without testing if it breaks the fail-over, are you?<p>If this comes out in favor of doing full failover, you're a bank or an airline or similar.

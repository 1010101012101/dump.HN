Thinking of it as a pair is not going to help you understand it.<p>from TFA:<p><i>The syntactic trick is how the API uses the name of the lambda’s parameter as the name of the HTML attribute</i><p>If your function is passed a function of one parameter, then it is a bit of a hack to vary behaviour based on the <i>name</i> of that parameter.

974012,comment,973803,973936,0,0,thejo,,,"On the first point, you have to remember that the larger a company grows, the more impersonal it becomes. Interviewing in most large companies is usually seen as a chore, the outcome of which does not have a huge impact on the interviewer. This is different in a startup, where hiring someone may significantly impact your own work. Of course, if the interview is conducted as though it is a chore, then it just sucks and you have to start thinking about how badly you need the job.<p>On questions, you can always ask about -<p>* the team you'll be joining<p>* if it's a small company / startup ask about their business and competition. An engineer who shows that he understands how his work fits into the larger picture is far more valuable than one who is happy to just write code.<p>* learning opportunities - large company or small, dig into what it is you can take away from the job<p>Of course, there's no point in making it a formality.

9635694,comment,9634468,9635203,0,0,electronvolt,,,"Something I learned during my first job (big box co. tech support and computer sales):  self service is great for people who know what they want or know more about what they&#x27;re buying than the salesperson does.  Groceries is a great example of this:  I generally know what I like to eat a lot more than most grocery clerks could possibly know, and I get groceries pretty often.<p>It&#x27;s less ideal when you don&#x27;t know much about the product (just that you need one) and don&#x27;t have the time to go spend a few weeks researching the purchase.  I spent some time selling computers:  for most customers, they knew what they wanted to do with the computer already (skype a military spouse, work on MS Office Documents, play Skyrim, whatever), but if I was helping them chances were they didn&#x27;t know how to quantify that in terms of CPU/RAM/HDD/Graphics card/etc., and being able to actually narrow their selection down to a few computers that could meet their needs and explain the differences between them seemed to really put people at ease in what would otherwise been a confusing process.<p>To expound on my point:  I don&#x27;t know anything about... say... HVAC systems.  A self service system for purchasing an HVAC would probably be unnecessarily stressful and confusing for me (at least, it would force me to go become knowledgeable about HVAC systems), and I might even make a mistake and get one that can&#x27;t actually handle heating and cooling my house.

I don&#x27;t disagree that the general public should be educated about the multi-sited nature of slavery of course; as an historian of this period I just wanted to point out that the people who actually study and teach this stuff are not trying to portray it as a solely European phenomenon.

You can learn to attack some classes of solved problems without having fun, but to be a mathematician you have to follow your sense of aesthetics.

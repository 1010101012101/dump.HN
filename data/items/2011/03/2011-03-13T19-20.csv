Anyone can come, change whatever they want and ship it as their own. This is what Ubuntu and others have been doing for years. The kind of competition you consider ""ideal"" is already happening, and has happened for years. The only problem is that some people seem to expect that because you hack on free software you should not be allowed to have strong opinions about the UX of the code <i>you</i> are doing, and must submit to the will of all users and drive-by designers on blogs (which routinely ask for an innumerable set of mutually contradicting features, threatening to leave the project if they are not listened to).",1300046165

Can you market it?  Can you sell it?  Can you raise venture capital?  What can you do?<p>Imagine a scenario in which I have two people, capable of all the potential in the world, pitching me an idea.  Imagine that I have a machine that can either add value to an idea, or add value to the business side of things -- whichever side I add value to, decreases it from the other side proportionally -- ie, if I add 25% of the 'value of the idea', I am subtracting from the 'business-management capabilities' by 25%.  In the end -- and forgive me, I just realized how dumb this hypothetical of mine is, but now I'm pretty much pot committed -- I end up with two idea guys -- one who has 25% better business acumen, and another with an idea that is 25% better -- I'm picking the first guy.<p>Alternately, of course, you can bootstrap, hire people, yadda yadda -- I'm guessing this isn't an option, as you haven't already done it.

Which if you want to boil it down further could be thought of as using the scientific method as quickly and efficiently as possible to create organizations and products where teams have fully adopted a culture of continuos improvement.<p>Lean is probably best  known for its ability to enable Toyota to be the amazing manufacturing organization they have been (ignoring recent growth related fuckups). See the book Lean Thinking or the many Lean Software books to see the ways in which people have translated Lean concepts to software development.

If you have seen the OODA loop or heard the phrase operating inside the enemies decision cycle then you have seen his work in action.

For example, I doubt that the creators of LOIC have ever used it themselves. Assange used to break into systems himself, but these days he just makes it easier for other people who break into systems to report what they find.<p>In the case of Wikileaks, these facilitators are at least themselves organized, lead by Julian Assange. In the case of Anonymous, they are less organized, spread across lots of random IRC channels, wikis, and imageboards, so that even the people running the show don't know who is running the show.<p>Such a system would, of course, collapse immediately, if there weren't a constant, massive influx of disgruntled people with Internet connections and plenty of free time to read through bugtraq archives and free online hacking guides, and the recklessness necessary to not care if you get caught (notice how various arrests haven't stopped anyone). Those who don't get caught, they eventually start teaching other people, providing kids who wander into lcirc asking ""how does I hacked BoA"" with the information necessary to make it happen. Recall that the hack that took down HBGary wasn't technically astounding; it was a combination of HBGary's total incompetence and Anon's willingness to try shit until it worked.<p>So, could this be Wikileaks operating under the banner of Anonymous, and is Wikileaks itself a part of Anonymous? It's hard to say, because Anonymous is itself more of a phenomenon than a group, a criticality accident of discontent, if you will.

We'll leave on a four hour trip and she won't think that it might be a good idea to eat before leaving.<p>Let's just say that it took a while before I made the connection from ""wow, we have most of our fights in the car"" to two things: my getting annoyed with other drivers and misplacing my aggression, and her getting peckish.<p>As for shirts, it's the same sort of choice as hiring a housekeeper.  The housekeeper time/value is a lot easier, though, as cleaning the house is certainly more onerous than ironing shirts. :-)",1300042976

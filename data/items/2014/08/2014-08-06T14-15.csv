For instance, he rented a video at Blockbuster (!) that he didn&#x27;t return. Blockbuster attempted to contact &quot;me&quot; several times about the video, assessing various late fees, but never charging them to my card for some odd reason, until finally it sent a collections agency after me. This entire, petty drama went unbeknownst to me until it wound up on my credit rating. All over a fraudulently derived, $15 late fee at a freaking video rental place.<p>Getting this incident wiped from my credit history took an elaborate and drawn-out series of phone calls, letters, forms, interviews, etc. Even then, a decent amount of damage had been done, and various reports had spawned other reports, and I was borked in countless derivative reports and company databases. I had to do some &quot;rebuilding&quot; (in the parlance of the credit companies) for a few years. And this was just one of several, roughly similar purchases that accrued in the system under my name. The irony is that a bolder thief, making bigger purchases and maxing out the card, would have caused less damage to me by catching everyone&#x27;s attention in flagrante delicto.",1407337050
8142751,comment,8140450,8140926,2,0,ethomson,,,"I would argue that you were right when you wrote:<p>> Even as Microsoft stuck to its waterfalls internally, Visual Studio was used by third-party developers who themselves wanted to use agile methods, creating pressure on the Developer Division to build better support for these approaches.<p>These features are definitely being driven by external customers.  (Disclaimer: I work on the TFS team, in particular on the Version Control team, so I can speak to the changes in version control throughout the years.)<p>TFS was initially conceived as a mix of the tools for software development (version control, issue tracking, continuous integration) that were heavily influenced by the tools already in use at Microsoft to build (say) Windows and Office.  That&#x27;s why the version control component in the first version of TFS was a checkout/edit/checkin model.  Clunky, yes, but scalable to the sizes of the codebases that we wanted to support internally.  That&#x27;s also why the work item tracking is crazily flexible in ways that are barely comprehensible to mortals, it was meant to adapt to the different development practices that go on around these parts.  So TFS 2005 looked a lot like the development tools that existed within Microsoft at the time, and it was really aimed at &quot;influential&quot; internal customers.<p>And that&#x27;s great, but most of our customers outside of these walls don&#x27;t have crazy multi-gigabyte source trees and the same checkout/edit/checkin model that&#x27;s so useful for a code base the size of Visual Studio is an unnecessary annoyance if you&#x27;ve got a much smaller or more modular code base.  And if you have a dodgy network connection or you travel alot, it&#x27;s downright problematic.  So bringing an edit/merge/commit model (&quot;local workspaces&quot;) and a DVCS (Git) to the party were truly about growing and adapting TFS for our customers, who tend to be a little lighter weight and more agile than we are.",1407337040

These bodies are not elected, so we can&#x27;t vote them out. While it&#x27;s true, in principle, that we could use the ballot to get Congress to claw back its power, or at least to influence the details, this would (a) take a really long time, and (b) is far too broad a brush to paint with. Being able to cast one vote every 2 years for my Representative, and one every six years for my Senator, is many orders of magnitude too gross a control to be able to influence specific regulations across the whole realm of governmental interest (suppose I hate the way the FDA is handling one thing, but love the way that the DOT is doing something else, etc.; how am I to influence all those factors with just two rare votes?)<p>Second, we&#x27;re no longer able to determine with certainty what our government is doing, in order to exercise control over it as necessary. For example, just yesterday afternoon there was a story [1] on HN covering the government&#x27;s efforts to actually rewrite the records of a court proceeding, so that we wouldn&#x27;t know what had actually transpired in the court.

8142657,comment,8140096,8141662,5,0,rayiner,,,"> 2- It&#x27;s government regulation that makes the tests so expensive.<p>Yes and no. You&#x27;ll see numbers saying that each approved drug costs several billion, with most of that money going to clinical testing. The reason for that is that something like 90-95% of candidate drugs never make it through clinical testing. So if you add up the clinical testing costs for each of these failed drugs, and amortize them over the approved drugs, you get these astronomical costs.<p>But I&#x27;m not sure if the takeaway is the same as what you&#x27;re saying. Would drug development be cheaper if these 90-95% of drugs that currently fail clinical testing made it onto the market? If you replaced the regulatory regime with the usual recourse of letting people sue for drugs that ended up being ineffective or harmful, then it probably wouldn&#x27;t be any cheaper for the drug companies. And if you blocked the legal remedy, then you&#x27;ve just externalized the cost of ineffective or harmful drugs onto the public.<p>It&#x27;s like a balloon: you can push all the air out of one side, and crow about how you&#x27;ve shrunk it down, but the air just goes to the other side. The fundamental issue is that drug development is intrinsically expensive: there&#x27;s an expense to proving drugs safe and effective through clinical trials, there&#x27;s an expense to allowing consumers to sue to recover for unsafe and ineffective drugs, and there&#x27;s an expense in allowing unsafe and ineffective drugs to enter the market.<p>The problem is that in a first-world country, taking years off of someone&#x27;s life is incredibly expensive, whether it happens because you sell a harmful drug, or because you sell an ineffective drug that precludes someone from taking an effective one. Let&#x27;s say the social value of a human life is $1 million per decade. One source puts the cost of regulatory approval for 12 leading pharma companies from 1997-2011 at $57 billion per year on average (<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/aroy/2012/04/24/how-the-fda-stifles-new-cures-part-i-the-rising-cost-of-clinical-trials"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/aroy/2012/04/24/how-the-fda-stif...</a>). What is that measured in person-decades? Only 57,000.

Constant insulin response that we have with all the sugar hidden (and not so hidden) in everything we eat causes swelling and fat storage.

If someone wanted to DDoS you, they hit the public IPs of these machines.  It can be nearly impossible to mitigate a large enough attack to the point of restoring normal service.  You&#x27;d most likely be forced to switch to entirely new IPs for a long enough attack event.  CloudFlare, in general, accomplishes their DDoS protection by having a super large, geographically redundant network that absorbs the attack before passing legitimate traffic on to your servers.<p>This problem isn&#x27;t strictly related to HTTP requests - it&#x27;s really anything running on your servers.  If the request is able to get past firewalls, switches, routers, to your machine, it has a chance to eat up resources, and ultimately take down that server / service.  WebSockets are being used more and more for event-based communications, as you mentioned, providing real-time updates instead of relying on polling, or long polling hacks.  Thus, they&#x27;re just as viable of an attack vector as directing an attack at port 80.  This is where the intermediate layer, provided by CloudFlare, comes into play.<p>The caching aspect of CloudFlare is an important, but separate aspect of their service.",1407335034

Lagrangian points L4 and L5 are not stable (with this definition) while L1, L2 and L3 are (only in theory, though, in practice perturbations matter a lot).<p>Since the mass distribution is unknown, we can&#x27;t quite predict if the orbit will be stable or not. The mass distribution may be very uneven and there may be spikes in the distribution (due to shape and porosity of the comet) that could cause the orbit to be unstable. The comet also rotates and makes things more difficult.<p>Now the goal of the crew is to find an orbit that is reasonably stable and predictable given the knowledge of mass distribution they have. Nevertheless, the space craft will probably have to do thrust maneuvers to stay in orbit around the comet.<p>And once the comet comes close enough to the sun and starts to lose mass to the vapor trail, all bets are off. That almost certainly implies some kind of unstability due to mass changes as well as the drag from the vapor trail. The comet may even break down to several pieces when it comes close to the sun.",1407334748

For example, the Solar System is chaotic that way in the ~100 MY time scale.

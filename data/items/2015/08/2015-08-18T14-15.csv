In fact, if you use Classic Theme Restorer (I use it not because I dislike australis, but because I really do not want a navigation toolbar), it has an option baked in to disable Pocket along with webrtc, et al.<p>Admittedly, I suppose it would be nice if Firefox actually packaged Pocket as a real extension that could be removed from the Extensions menu, but they have already integrated several things without using that schema.<p>I still use firefox, just with more and more things disabled, because none of the other browsers out there even come close to having what I need in a GUI browser (though, I would note that I&#x27;m evermore tempted to abandon GUI browsing altogether).<p>Either way, the write-up is great, and everything in the article other than that one characterization (which rubbed me a bit the wrong way in the wake of all the fevered discussions around the Pocket Integration) was a truly enjoyable read.

Thanks for telling me about gun.io, because I hadn&#x27;t heard of them, but they seem like basically just a slightly hipper version of a contract programming agency, and there are many of those. I don&#x27;t want to deal with a concierge and sort through resumes (to reiterate, I can already get that exact service from dozens of established agencies) and I don&#x27;t want to hire people for weeks/months to be &quot;part of the team&quot; -- which seems to be what gun.io is geared towards. I could be misunderstanding what they do, of course.<p>For my purposes, I like the elance/Freelancer model, where I can post a job and quickly hire someone to do 2 hours or 20 hours of specific work. I&#x27;ve just been very disappointed with the quality of work I&#x27;ve gotten every single time I&#x27;ve used these services (with one exception, noted above).",1439906419

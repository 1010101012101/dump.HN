With Dish, in the case of &quot;Primetime Any Time&quot;, the Hopper receiver (the DVR) receives the tv signal and records the broadcasts from Fox and I think 3 other stations onto a dedicated partition on it. From there, if the customer has the Sling adapter accessory or the built in sling adapter the customer can stream any live or recorded content to just about any internet connected device. So using Prime Time Anytime where the commercials are skipped, and streaming the content over the internet is pretty awesome for the DVR owner. This is all different from Aereo which for all intents and purposes held the DVR and then streamed the output of it to the user via the internet.",1405364379

8032556,comment,8028793,8028793,2,0,dkarl,,,"I&#x27;m very frustrated by the house door keyless entry systems on the market, having just ordered a Kevo despite being underwhelmed and a little bit concerned by the Amazon reviews.  It blows my mind (in a bad way) to see eager buyers waiting for neophytes to get acquainted with the business of hardware while the keyless entry system for my car has worked perfectly for five years now.  It seems like it would go so much better for consumers if a company in the automobile industry would spin off a unit to tackle the problem.  They have people with all the right experience, not just with the manufacturing challenges described in the article but with ergonomics, testing for durability, and security.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s an economic or business reason why it&#x27;s unfolding the way it is, but that doesn&#x27;t reduce my frustration.  So many things feel backward about it.  Starting with a cheap, bolt-on almost-solution?  That doesn&#x27;t seem right for a part of your home that you interact with every day.  Using consumers as beta testers?  That feels wrong for a security device that controls access to your home and everything you own.  Developing a home keyless entry system without exploiting the human capital developed on successful keyless entry systems for cars?  Definitely the hard way.  It seems like the right way for a home keyless entry system to be developed would be for a company with lots of resources and relevant experience to develop a reliable, durable, convenient solution and then work on bringing the cost down from a thousand bucks to something reasonable.  Instead, we have little companies trying to scrape by selling not-quite-there products at early adopter prices.  (I paid over $200 for the Kevo despite Amazon reviews reporting, among other things, accidental engagement of the deadbolt while the door is swinging shut.)<p>I don&#x27;t hold any of this against Lockitron.  They&#x27;re taking the route they are out of necessity, and I&#x27;m grateful for it, because without them and other upstarts, the market wouldn&#x27;t be moving forward at all.  At this point I feel conflicted, because I&#x27;d hate to see their work rewarded by getting blown out of the water by a bigger, better-funded competitor, but on the other hand, that seems like the fastest way for me to get a product I really like.<p>(As a final note/aside, determining intent to unlock the door is an unsolvable problem with traditional door hardware.  Usability is going to suck until all the lock/latch/knob hardware is redesigned for keyless entry.  Everything until then is just intermediate steps until home hardware catches up to the standard set by automobiles.)",1405364320

Authentication is simply ensuring that you are you. Normal security mechanism, nothing wrong with it.<p>DRM can employ authentication in itself, sure. But DRM is not about ensuring that you are you. DRM is about <i>limiting what you can do with your own system in various ways and / or spying on you (even when it already knows that you are you)</i>. Simply because DRM is preemptive policing.<p>I have no problem with authentication, same way I have no problems with you using a lock on your door (normal security). I have problems with DRM, same way I&#x27;d have problems with police putting their camera in someone&#x27;s house (overreaching preemptive policing).<p>Hopefully this makes it more clear. I often see people confuse DRM with merely security / authentication / encryption etc. That&#x27;s plain wrong.<p><i>> The key is to realize that DRM as practiced by corporations is evil and unworkable because the economics were utterly unrealistic.</i><p>No. It&#x27;s evil because it&#x27;s using police state methodology of treating everyone as potential criminal and employing presumption of guilt, which results in overreaching policing measures which violate one&#x27;s privacy and security.",1405364280

But I really don&#x27;t think newspapers are going to go extinct, really ever.</i><p>Still, particular newspapers have already gone extinct by the hundrends, and the trend is not showing any signs of reversing.<p>><i>They are one of the only permanent records of history. Digital publications disappear like yesterday&#x27;s rainclouds.</i><p>Sure, but it&#x27;s not like people, the average consumer etc, appreciates that fact or gives a damn about &quot;permanently recording history&quot;. Most of them don&#x27;t even print their digital photos, maybe 5-10 of the best ones, whereas they used to have albums with 100s of family photos back in the day. (And most don&#x27;t even backup their digital photos).<p>That newspapers served as &quot;permanent records of history&quot; was a byproduct of them being available, dominant and profitable. Not something people specifically bought them and subsidized them for.<p>><i>There will always -- always -- be demand for physical products, because as humans we are very tactile.</i><p>Well, tablets are quite tactile too. And people have quit CDs and vinyl for mp3s and digital downloads/piracy.<p>Sure, there&#x27;s still vinyl pressed. But it&#x27;s small quantities and is consumed without any wider cultural context in the society, just by a tiny niche of music fans. And pressing vinyl is a $1000 affair -- so you can afford to press 300 copies for stores etc, where running a newspaper is extremely costly, and a print edition even more so. So the difficulty of continuing one is not the same as continuing the other (vinyl) niche tradition.<p>><i>The bottom line is that there is always going to be a demand for newspapers and news in general. In fact, people have been predicting the demise of the newspaper since TV was invented.</i><p>That&#x27;s a common logical error. The belief that if people have been making the same prediction that didn&#x27;t pan out, it will never pan out.<p>Not to mention: who said it didn&#x27;t pan out? When radio/TV was invented, newspapers might not have vanished, but they lost a lot of their cachet as THE source of news and information.<p>The loss in readers was ofset by an increase in education and thus an increase in a middle class wanting to read newspapers. But that was a historical accident. The spread of the internet didn&#x27;t see any such simultaneous increase of middle class or literacy (probably because they had already hit a ceiling during the seventies).<p>And TV, back in the day, had limited chanels and was live only. So not much of competition for the newspaper. Nowadays we have 200+ channel options, 24-hour news channels,  Tivo and its ilk, and video on demand from the internet. Plus, written news on demand from the internet.<p>Plus, the numbers (of declining readership) are very different (and much worse) in the internet age vs the tv age.",1405363908

But the number of people accused is far less than one in ten.<p>In the case of denial, &quot;the odds of denial, given innocence&quot; is very nearly the same as &quot;the odds of denial, regardless&quot;, so the odds don&#x27;t shift back much.<p>So it is more likely after accusation and denial than before accusation and denial.  Note that this doesn&#x27;t mean that it is <i>more probable than not</i>, it means that it is <i>more probable than it was</i>.  That depends on the base rate that we agree needs to be incorporated.  But there being a low base rate doesn&#x27;t change what is or isn&#x27;t evidence, or the strength of that evidence.<p><i>&quot;We&#x27;re in the same position as we were before the allegation was made.

Let&#x27;s not mix unrelated subjects.</i><p>What is the limiting of who can have my personal data and when, but Digital Rights Management, or DRM? One cannot stop at authentication, because to be complete, one has to prevent copying data. Without this, it becomes problematic to trace who has released information, and without some legal support, nothing at all is practical.<p><i>DRM can not be trustworthy by its mere definition</i><p>Sorry, but this is fluff. You could apply this &quot;logic&quot; to authentication as well. DRM has to involve some mutual trust and cooperation to the same extent that any protocol involves mutual trust and cooperation.<p>The key is to realize that DRM as practiced by corporations is evil and unworkable because the <i>economics</i> were utterly unrealistic. Really, where DRM could help individuals would be the elimination of trivial deniability on the part of corporations. Right now, when your data privacy is breached, there is no cost to &quot;break&quot; anything and it&#x27;s very hard to pin this on a particular corporation. Add a DRM mechanism, and then there is something tangible to apply protection laws to and a labor cost with definite intent to breach an individual&#x27;s privacy. In aggregate, the cost and potential legal liability becomes too high to for virtually any corporation to contemplate. We would arrive at a situation where corporations could afford to violate the privacy of a few select individuals, but could no longer do so to the public wholesale. Ordinary citizens would enjoy a measure of protection, though rich individuals and corporations would not.<p>Sounds pretty good to me.<p>Underlying everything, I&#x27;m not so much advocating DRM, as I&#x27;m calling to question emotionally charged &quot;magical thinking&quot; combined with naive induction. Let&#x27;s not just leave things at &quot;DRM is bad&quot; devoid of real examination of what&#x27;s happening.<p>EDIT: It also occurs to me that the <i>historical factual differences</i> between individuals and corporations should be used to modify the current formulation of &quot;legal persons.&quot; &quot;Legal Persons&quot; should be considered as &quot;persons&quot; only in terms of a few specific factors, like the owning of property. The historical difference between actual and legal persons with regards to data privacy abuses would be an important corpus of information in support of this.",1405362150

Why do local ISP markets tend towards monopoly, even though it has been illegal since 1992 to grant local cable monopolies? Two words: universal access.<p>It&#x27;s the same principle that led municipalities to grant taxicab monopolies, of the kind that stifle companies like Uber today. The idea is that in a free market, providers would only focus on the profitable parts of the city, leaving the lower-income areas without service.<p>Universal access is why it&#x27;s impossible to &quot;disrupt&quot; the market for local internet. A new entrant can&#x27;t just come into the market and pick off the most desirable customers or the ones that are cheapest to service. They have to be prepared to service everyone, even many customers who can only be served at a loss, in order to be allowed to operate at all. Additional regulation in this space isn&#x27;t going to eliminate the underlying problem, it will just make infrastructure construction a more unattractive business and decrease investment.<p>There is no free lunch. You can have: neutrality, universal access, or a mostly privately-funded telecom infrastructure, but you only get to pick two. If you think universal access is important, and net neutrality is important, you have to be willing to publicly subsidize the construction of telecom infrastructure.<p>PS. Some folks have mentioned BT OpenReach, but it&#x27;s important to understand what did and did not happen there. First, BT was originally a government-owned corporation before it was privatized, so the government was in a position to set the terms of the privatization. Second, the government used a fairly generous &quot;RPI - X&quot; price cap to certain of BT&#x27;s services. Between monopoly pricing power and a relatively generous price cap, BT made very healthy returns on investment. See: <a href=""http://www.academia.edu/3399930/LESSONS_OF_PRIVATISATION_IN_THE_UK"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.academia.edu/3399930/LESSONS_OF_PRIVATISATION_IN_...</a> (p. 28-9).<p>In the U.S., unbundled DSL was a failure. First, it got caught up in litigation because the infrastructure was never public at any point. Second, it was an almost pure losing proposition for the telecom companies. The FCC mandated a not-very-generous cost-based price control (TELRIC), which made further investments in DSL infrastructure unattractive.",1405361626

There seem to be some good concepts in there for formulating a solution to my present personal challenge:  integrating multiple disparate sources of real-time events, some transient and being delivered with low latency, and some persistent but retrieved with high latency (up to 30min!), which needs to be analyzed (and potentially replayed and reanalyzed), producing a best-effort real-time feature stream while populating (and repopulating) a reliable data warehouse. It&#x27;s taking me a long time to break the problem down to the right level of components.<p>> As soon as a queue tries to have durable messages it is becoming a database and has all of the problems a database has to deal with.

It seems to me that metered internet could work just fine, if the prices are at least somewhat connected with reality (meaning cents per gigabyte at most, with a base cost not more than about $20/month). The form of metering we currently have in the US is usually punitive overage charges for data in excess of some unrealistically low monthly quota, and is applied on top of $60+/month subscription fees. <i>That&#x27;s</i> obviously bad for internet content providers (since their whole point is to deter further usage), but I think reasonable prices are possible.",1405361326

The policy matter is not whether copyright holders should receive recompense for their products (they should), but whether legislation to protect that right is aircover to perpetuate old practices at the expense of new networks. There is no doubt there are honest-to-God Web pirates operating in China, Russia, and elsewhere who are stealing copyrighted product. These pirates should be stopped. But SOPA’s effort to accomplish this – which also just happened to strengthen the hand of content companies in other regards – applied concepts more applicable to the command and control networks of yesterday than to the open access networks of today. The result was an unparalleled protest and a political train wreck.<p>Does that sound like some mustache-twirling lobbyist-in-disguise?<p>Or his thinking about net neutrality from 2009:<p>> So, in a world where spectrum licensees are unwilling to part with their assignments and the spectrum agency wants to help while at the same time increasing demand, why isn’t net neutrality an opportunity for the wireless industry? Viewing the current spectrum and net neutrality issues holistically rather than in isolation just might be an opportunity for both the wireless industry and the Administration.<p>> President Obama campaigned on his support for net neutrality. Thus, it should come as no surprise that his FCC chairman has moved promptly on the matter, or that a Democrat-controlled commission is likely to adopt it. How it is implemented thus becomes more important than whether it exists. Rules that recognize the unique characteristics of a spectrum-based service and allow for reasonable network management would seem to be more important than the philosophical debate over whether there should be rules at all. Similarly, a rule that allows for variable pricing is an opportunity for wireless carriers to change the revenue paradigm at a time when revenue per megabyte is in a freefall.<p><a href=""http://www.mobilemusings.net/2009/11/net-neutrality-and-spectrum-quest.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mobilemusings.net/2009/11/net-neutrality-and-spec...</a>",1405361123

Hamming would probably agree with Adleman here.<p>Perhaps they would agree that one should have some ambition and do what&#x27;s important, but Feynman would have you sneak up on it from behind, while keeping the juices flowing with playfulness.

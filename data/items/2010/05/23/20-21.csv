In exchange for a steep discount on your freelance rate, a salary gives you, in rough order of value:<p>* The employer's half of FICA<p>* A paycheck when you're not utilized<p>* Access to group health and some contribution towards your monthly payment<p>* Someone else to hunt down and close gigs for you<p>* Vacation and sick days<p>Take your freelance rate, knock off 30% for health and taxes (your ""fully loaded"" rate, which might include office space), and then another 40% for unutilized time, and you're ballparking what a salary looks like before you factor in the amount of effort you put into marketing, sales, and contracts.",1274648170

The new district leader offered a renegotiation of the teacher's contract in which they would give up their tenure rights in exchange for raises of the average teachers salary so that the bottom would be 70000 and the top would be 120000.  The union was flatly against this renegotiation plainly stating that they would rather have security to be mediocre than have the opportunity to earn up to 3 times what they were currently earning.<p>completely ridicules.  to my mind a district that pays their top teachers 120000 solves the entire problem.

Nowhere did I mention viewing a car as an investment.<p>There is no rationalization.  Of course it's more cost but there is also cost associated with reducing the amount of cash you have on hand.  With that said, a car is the second biggest purchase most people make.  It would be great if they all had the thousands of dollars to buy a reliable car with cash, but many don't.<p>Personally the last car I bought was used and I got a 6% 5 year loan.  I typically make double payments on cars so the loan is almost over less than 3 years in.  I did the math the other day and accounting for interest I've done much better by buying the car on credit and leaving the rest of the money in my various investments.  Over 2-3 years 6% isn't much to begin with so it's pretty easy to beat with other various investments.",1274646704

As an adult I follow the debate on education reform and I am frequently informed that there is something wrong with those examinations. If teachers took them seriously and modified their teaching with the aim of improving their pupils scores, this would be ""teaching to the test"" and educational outcomes would suffer.<p>As a child I took them seriously and modified my learning with the aim of improving my scores. Was I harming my education by taking the examinations seriously? Why do concerns about the quality of the examinations come out now, when teachers' pay is on the line? Why not earlier when children's qualifications were at issue?<p>The teacher's union party line, that ""merit pay leads to teaching to the test and that would be bad"" is a slap in the face to studious children who took their examinations seriously. It destroys the credibility of the profession.<p>Is it possible to construct good tests? <a href=""http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~fv/books/em/EssentialMaths.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~fv/books/em/EssentialMaths.pdf</a> is an interesting example of a test aimed at ensuring minimum standards at the start of a university mathematics course.<p>The usual technique for gaming an examination is to memorise answers to a core set of questions that keep coming up. For example one games a calculus examination by memorising cos 2x => -2 sin 2x and the examiners play along by providing enough easy questions that you can reach the pass mark with doing the hard questions that make the examination look tough.<p>In the article the examiner, Franco Vivaldi, is refusing to play the game. Instead of designing the test so that it can be broken and students can be passed even though they haven't learned the essential technique, Vivaldi takes the opposite tack and tries to design a test with enough variety that students have to learn the relevant mathematics.<p>Would teaching to this test do any harm? Drilling the techniques to get faster and more accurate in pursuit of a higher score would be harmful. Vivaldi needs his students to be competent because these techniques occur as basic techniques in the more advanced material that he aims to teach. He needs his students to be fluent enough that difficulties with the basics do not distract them in the course of advanced work, but beyond that their time is better spent on the advanced work, not on acquiring greater fluency with the basics. Knowing this he sets the test as pass/fail.<p>The success of merit pay will depend on improving the tests. It will be an interesting battle to watch.",1274646620

While sketching, I also figure out the main features and then the main db tables and methods/functions. Sometimes the sketch paper has some competitors there, ideas around how to make money, user experience notes etc... Often a little supersimple objectmodel or db scheme too. Always fits on 1 page.<p>1.5 Put that sketch on my ""ideas"" wall. Most ideas never make it. But for the ones that do:<p>2. Set up local domain mynewsite.peter, and optionally put codeigniter on it.<p>3. Put 1 or 2 html pages up.<p>4. Create a database table or two, code some functions that call it, and get something working.<p>Now I have something working, I iterate on it finetuning it for a while. And if I still like it, I might improve it a little and put it online for friends to play with. I've done projects that I launched but only ever used myself.",1274645063

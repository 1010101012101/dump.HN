The answer he gave made sense.<p>He said the reason Japanese websites were so busy was the greater percentage of mobile-only customers, many of whom weren&#x27;t using smartphones.  You could go to a website on your cheap &quot;feature phone&quot; and still comfortably navigate a site that was mostly a sea of links, while the sort of site you see more commonly in the West requires navigating too many pages.<p>Smart phone penetration in China is still around 50%, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the same logic applies.<p>EDIT:  He also said in Japan programmers have about the same social status as the guy on the loading dock, so many of the corporate sites were programmed by fresh-out-of-college guys who would be passing that task off to someone else as soon as possible.

But now you&#x27;re talking way more work, and yet another IR. If you&#x27;re going to build another IR for this, and you really really want to compile to C, why not just fix up LLVM&#x27;s C backend and save yourself a lot of work?<p>> Nope. Once you have generated C code, you debug your C code with gdb or whatever is available. No problems there.<p>Debugging the generated C code is not a good experience. A developer wants to develop the code they wrote. For that to work you need fine-grained control over the contents of the DWARF DIEs.<p>> Nope. C compilation is about an order of magnitude faster than C++ compilation.<p>I&#x27;m not comparing C++ compilation to C compilation. I&#x27;m comparing the time it takes to compile C to LLVM IR, plus the overhead of in-memory or disk serialization, against zero (which is what you have if you go straight to LLVM IR).<p>> LLVM IR creates an additional abstraction barrier between a game programmer&#x27;s code and hardware.<p>A C compiler IR, like LLVM IR, is not an additional abstraction barrier.

Water coolers &quot;were supposed to be the equivalent of a drinking fountain.&quot;<p>...<p>> The 2001 plumbing code under which UCF&#x27;s stadium was designed gave builders the option of installing water fountains or &quot;bottled water coolers.&quot;<p>> But several officials who are closely involved with building codes told the Orlando Sentinel that bottled-water coolers referred to refrigerated units fed by large plastic jugs, commonly found in offices.<p>> The code, they said, was not meant to include refrigerators containing individual bottles of water for sale, such as those that vendors used at the stadium last Saturday.<p>It then says that the university &quot;was not subject to review by another government agency. That&#x27;s because the university, like school districts, has the authority to issue its own permits and can decide whether it meets most building standards.&quot;<p>as well as pointing to a few previous cases:<p>> In 2003, the new stadium for the NFL&#x27;s Philadelphia Eagles opened without water fountains for the general public in what was called an oversight. In 1962, Dodger Stadium architects in Los Angeles forgot to install drinking fountains, though some suspected the team&#x27;s owner wanted to boost beer and soda sales.<p>In general there was a lot of astonishment over the lack of water fountains.<p>Oh, and no, you can&#x27;t bring in your own drinks. They might contain alcohol, so beer sales would go down ... err, I mean that people might get drunk and rowdy or violent.",1454891985

11055754,comment,11054089,11055418,0,0,comex,,,"> Is it more portable in a way that matters though?<p>A few months ago when I was trying to compile swiftc&#x27;s IR with emscripten, I would have said &quot;definitely yes&quot;.  It didn&#x27;t work both because of a LLVM version mismatch and because, well, the NaCl backend passes were apparently only tested on IR generated by Clang - random differences in what swiftc generated, like using &#x27;add&#x27; with a constant right hand side instead of get-element-ptr, not simplifying struct returns to return-via-pointer-argument, etc. made it variously abort or outright crash.  As you know, Rust has never really worked with it either due to the version mismatch.<p>Admittedly, though, that&#x27;s mainly emscripten&#x27;s fault, and I expect the new WebAssembly backend in trunk to be much more robust.  Other than that, a few reasons I can think of to want to compile to C:<p>- Performance.  Other compiler backends often produce more efficient code than LLVM; not always, but it&#x27;s nice to be able to test several independent production-quality C compilers and pick the fastest, while with LLVM IR you&#x27;re stuck with what you have.  Same goes for compilation speed, though LLVM usually ranks well at that, and even working around optimizer bugs.<p>- Windows support for LLVM is still not up to par yet.  Supposedly it will be in the near future.<p>- (edit) Easier to integrate with unusual platform-specific compilation modes, like C++/CLI or Apple&#x27;s LLVM bitcode distribution (well, that is LLVM, but imagine in the future someone comes up with a similar system based on a different compiler).<p>- You can distribute the C output from your compiler, and others can use it without having to work your compiler into their build process.  Like distributing object files, but those only work on one platform, while C works anywhere.  (Caveat: compilers often need to know data layout, which in practice means you might need to have separate C outputs for 64-bit and 32-bit pointer sizes, and not support any more exotic data representations.  But that&#x27;s still way more portable than an object file.)  Notably, even if you only need to distribute to people using LLVM, LLVM IR is not designed to be cross-platform.<p>Incidentally, for this reason, I&#x27;d love if someone made a Rust to C compiler, preferably working on the AST level to avoid the unreadable spaghetti that the LLVM C backend used to generate.  It&#x27;s easier to say &quot;swap out this insecure C library with a secure Rust library&quot; (to a larger C/C++ program) if doing so is a matter of swapping C files - distributing &#x27;binaries&#x27; is suboptimal from a maintainability perspective, but not much worse than, e.g., SQLite&#x27;s &quot;amalgamation&quot; distribution.",1454891292

IBM solved big problems with big, expensive solutions. Nowadays, developers regularly make the purchasing decisions, not upper-management, so FOSS or Freemium products win out over expensive IBM software licenses. IBM hardware is largely dying out because the Cloud and x86 won the architecture wars and no one wants to develop for PowerPC or AIX. So the legacy IBM is dying on the table.<p>IBM is losing its old accounts and old business agreements faster than it can generate new revenue with Softlayer/Bluemix/Watson. IBM makes 4.5B from Cloud revenue. In contrast, total revenue in 2015 was 81.7B. So IBM revenue is going to be a bloodbath until Cloud revenue can catch up. Unfortunately, Cloud is a razor thin margin business, where Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are willing to sell at, or below cost to gain marketshare, which will likely continue to hurt IBM&#x27;s cloud revenue at a time it needs it most. IBM is the underdog here, so it can not bring any of the other cloud giants to the table and make them end the price wars, so IBM cloud revenue is likely to remain anemic.<p>IBM also suffers from a number of management mistakes. IBM is way behind on automation and lacks the talent, so they&#x27;ve had to make acquisitions and &quot;strategic partnerships&quot; to buy it. IBM previously tried to outsource as much software and operations to China or India, and the unskilled labor available in those countries simply don&#x27;t have the skill sets to do devops or any sort of basic automation. So you&#x27;ve got datacenters where people still ssh into each box and run commands by hand thousands of times because the skill level isn&#x27;t there. But hey, a few quarters of lower labor expenses in exchange for long term growth is a great deal when you can just parachute out.<p>Other mistakes IBM has made includes massive buildup of debt and stock buybacks to inflate the stock price. As bad as the stock looks now, just consider how bad it would be if IBM hadn&#x27;t spent 8B+ buying back stock. These buybacks have largely been financed by new corporate debt. IBM&#x27;s market cap is nearly 40% less than only a few years ago. These buybacks hide a lot of the stock price damage (the stock would be worth about $75 instead of ~$130). In addition, buybacks are  essentially returning money from the corporation to the shareholders, unwinding the assets. This means IBM management has no plans which could return a higher yield to investors than simply handing back their money -- not great for investor confidence or long term future for IBM.<p>Source: Employee.",1454890091

There are 300,000 employees and more teams/products/departments than you can imagine. It&#x27;s absolutely insane.<p>However, what I can say is the following: IBM is shifting it&#x27;s strategy completely and that would&#x27;ve been very difficult to do without a drop in revenue and stock price. IBM is going from whatever it was before to a cloud-based company. All services and products will need to have some sort of cloud offering. I&#x27;m not sure if you can imagine what moving 300k employees worth of work to the cloud means. IBM has existed for like 100+ years now, this industry has not existed until a couple of years ago and, right now, all teams must re-evaluate their work and make the steps towards making this transition happen.<p>Many of the employees are stuck in their old ways, many people have been working at IBM their whole career (20-30-40 years) and it might be hard to adjust to so many new directives coming from the top. There&#x27;s much bureaucracy and many old ways that need to be absolutely obliterated. Also, IBM doesn&#x27;t have a great reputation for being cool or anything... almost everybody hates Lotus Notes, as an example.<p>This was sort of all over the place, I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of time thinking about this.

The North Korean conventional ballistic arsenal is too small to matter very much.<p>What they&#x27;re really worried about is South Korea developing the capability to stop the North Koreans from delivering a nuclear bomb.  The Chinese are probably thinking the US is more likely to nuke the North Koreans if we don&#x27;t believe they can retaliate effectively.<p>Still, it doesn&#x27;t make much sense to me.  If we were to make a first strike on North Korea we would get their nukes with a pretty high degree of confidence.  Not that we would anyway, but the strategic consideration there is China&#x27;s response,  not North Korea&#x27;s.",1454890040

A <i>lot</i> of Walmart locations have gotten subsidized building permits because counties think they attract a lot of business and grow the economy. They do - in the short term - just due to scale, until every other business withers and dies. You get a slight boost from cheaper prices before you realize rather than having an internal money cycle between small businesses you now have minimum wage workers at Walmart making the Walton&#x27;s rich off your communities wealth which is rapidly going away.<p>But Walmarts core business depends on the ability to use state aid to subsidize their employees - pay them barely above minimum wage, give them all the welfare pamphlets to get medicaid coverage, food stamps, electric subsidies, etc - and that lets them outcompete everyone since they don&#x27;t have to assume any burden as a multinational business operating in a local market where their economies of scale and corporate efficiency mean nobody else can compete with them on goods pricing. Their employees make unnaturally high relative wages because they spend so much effort hooking them up with state programs to subsidize their starvation wages.<p>And a large part of why these cities are in crisis is because archaic and overzealous zoning and building codes, and an immense amount of property-as-an-investment movements in the economy for the ultrarich since 2008 put up immense barriers to natural business growth. When you have all these regulations in your way it becomes way too much of an opportunity cost to try, especially when regulations are often intentionally written to be impossible to interpret for a non-lawyer, and even remain nebulous intentionally by the corporate sponsors who had them enacted as a means to stifle competition.<p>Most of us here are in software - why? What keeps the software industry growing so much compared to almost any other business? Part of it certainly is innovation and utility, but there is no way that tech valuations are realistic or that the frequency of unicorn startups is reflected at all in almost any other industry today. And I would certainly postulate that is in <i>huge</i> part due to the incredibly low barriers of entry to developing and distributing software as a product. Everything else has huge physical opportunity costs and often magnitudes more logistical and legal hurdles that make competition impossible, so it should surprise no one major entrepreneurial growth is disproportionately coming from software.",1454889737

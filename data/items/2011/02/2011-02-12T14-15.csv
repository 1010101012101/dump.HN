Here is the issue you identified:<p><i>It turns out that getting churches to initially part with their money isn't nearly as hard as convincing them that the investment of TIME is worth it for them and their members. Building an online community takes effort on the part of the church to promote it, and most give up within months. It's not unlike a forum or Facebook group; just sticking something out there doesn't draw in anyone.</i><p>Every time I see something like this, I wish I could figure out how to capitalize on (ie monetize) my ability to get conversation going and keep conversation going in online forums.  My ability to do that is ironic since I actually suck at <i>starting</i> conversations of my own (see my submissions on HN for an example of how lame I am at that).  Yet, I know how  to respond to other people and shape the forum culture to make it warm and welcoming and encourage people to open up. I have had repeated experiences where I joined some existing list or forum which had very little traffic in spite of significant membership and within a few months of joining traffic and membership increased significantly.  Typically, the owner then says something along the lines of ""I have no idea what happened but all of a sudden we are growing"". I know exactly what happened and never get credit for it.<p>Anyway, my only point is that it is possible to intentionally make community happen and increase traffic, usefulness, etc.  Teaching members how to do that would make this stickier.  And probably would take less time and energy than the three years you have already sunk into this.<p>Peace and good luck.",1297521712

The Linux kernel provides a rich collection of functions for synchronization and hardware access that, properly used, eliminate almost all need for volatile in regular kernel code.
If you are writing code for an in-order embedded processor and have little or no infrastructure besides the C compiler, you may need to lean more heavily on volatile.""",1297521669

Apart from the simple fact of early availability to pirates, these kinds of leaks can change the early review climate, since now reviews can come from all sorts of sources, not just the journalists given preview copies. What effect <i>that</i> has might depend on how good the game is (and how close to done the leaked version is).<p>A worse outcome than just the leaked version being available would be if it led to a flurry of negative reviews of the pre-release version, the way leaks of bad films have a much more negative effect on opening-weekend sales than leaks of good films do--- the didn't-see-it-because-everyone-said-it-sucked effect can be larger than the didn't-see-it-because-I-already-pirated-it effect.<p>The best outcome for EA would probably be a flood of reviews of the form: ""wow this is an <i>amazing</i> game but a few things are broken in the leaked version, which I assume will be fixed by release"".",1297521498

If you don't believe me, simply look at how effective the Finn's tactics were in the Winter War.<p>To put it simply everyone has access to liquor and fuel. From what I've read it still only seems to take 2-3 molotov cocktails to force the crew out of a tank (IIRC British crew were forced out of an APC from 3 hits that weren't visibly targeted), once the crew is out of the tank you either have a nice new tank, or access to munitions that can be used to your own advantage, or you simply killed 3 enemy combatants and a molotov inside the tank will ultimately render it useless or could potentially set off their ammunition and destroy the tank.<p>The military is armed to fight militaries. A tank, even a small unit of 20 men is no match for a guy on the 12th floor with a balcony lined with self-igniting molotovs. No weaponry on the tank can shoot him and a blanket bombing into the midst of the troops is going to kill most of them and the guy can be gone before any soldiers ever get to him (pulling the fire alarm disables elevators in most buildings, plus I doubt soldiers would ever trap themselves in an elevator when they've just been molotoved 5-seconds ago).<p>Over 80% of our populations live within urban areas, which in the US' case represents 2% of its land. Even given 1% of the population standing up to fight against their government would result in 2.4 million combatants in these urban areas, basically meaning insta-win for the guerillas as the US military only has 1.5 million active soldiers (I doubt you'd have 100% willing to fight against their own civilians, and I seriously doubt they'd manage to get 100% of the 1.4 million reservists to fight). Given the Finns lethality in the Winter War (6 soviet deaths/injuries to every 1 Finn; note this included the Soviets dropping cluster bombs). On the number of tanks the Finns destroyed ~100 tanks for every one they lost, so to put it simply the guerrillas likely destroyed near 3500 tanks with little formal hardware or weapons.<p>The thing that annoys me is that people think 'tank' and think its invincible from anything but a bigger badder weapon (IE a missile). Most tanks operate with their hatches open so they can see around themselves as they barely have any view from within the tank, which means a single hit with a molotov could potentially destroy the tank. A few of these attacks would mean all tanks would have their hatches closed, meaning operating blind when inside a city (they don't just have to see 360 degrees around themselves, but also 180 degrees above them).<p>Once the fighting starts, the civilians will have access to captured munitions. IE grenades, rifles and if they're lucky captured shells from a tank. Screw a molotov cocktail, a tank shell falling 10-stories would definitely be bye-bye to a tank.",1297521102

You are dedicated to substance over appearance, and for that, I give you an upvote.<p>Sadly, most people are more complicated than that.<p>If engineering alone mattered, then the dominant desktop computer would be the Commodore Amiga.  OS/2 Warp would be the standard business platform.  TOPS-20 would be the server operating system of choice.  They would all be written in concurrent versions of BLISS and run on multicore descendants of the DEC Alpha microprocessor.  Microsoft would be a third-tier maker of programming languages.  The Intel 8086 line would be long forgotten.  Unix and C would be unknown outside of Bell Labs.  Finally, academics and the cool open source hackers would be using different flavors of portable Lisp Machine.<p>""Man has as much of a sensible as of a rational nature.""

That is not fundamenatally what temperature <i>is</i>, though it works out that way for many common systems.  Temperature is a way to measure which way energy will flow between two objects at equilibrium.  Equilibrium in this case means a maximum entropy distribution.   Which way will energy flow so as to maximize this.  Well, we just take the derivative of entropy with respect to energy transfer, and we get the equilibrium condition.  T is (partial S / partial E)^(-1)",1297520709

The product is fairly mature, being in use at my own mid-sized church since 2006.<p>The problem is, my customer churn rate is horrendous, and growth is almost non-existent. Most churches cancel within a year of signing up.<p>It turns out that getting churches to initially part with their money isn't nearly as hard as convincing them that the investment of TIME is worth it for them and their members. Building an online community takes effort on the part of the church to promote it, and most give up within months. It's not unlike a forum or Facebook group; just sticking something out there doesn't draw in anyone.<p>So, the bad:<p>- Little or no significant growth.<p>- Product doesn't provide enough immediate value to customers.<p>- It's a time sink in support and I'm getting burned out, considering there isn't a viable business at the end of the tunnel.<p>Now, the good:<p>+ The business is in the black (barely), and it doesn't have any debt.<p>+ I still have my day job, which pays the bills.<p>+ The product does have a (tiny) bit of name recognition among church techies.<p>I see my options as:<p>* Pivot the product toward something less social that provides immediate value to church staff/leaders (rather than members), e.g. Church Management Solution (database).<p>* Provide some notice, and shut down the service. Keep my day job and find some other hobby.<p>...and maybe there's an option I'm overlooking...<p>HN, give me some advice.

The best way to do this is by creating an ""avatar"", which is a symbol for someone being remotely present. When you get closer to it, you can see exactly who is being represented by this avatar. If you think of it from the social robotics and symbolic interactionism (sociology) point of view, it is one of the most beautiful TPR solutions out there to date.

I establish a website to promote my views, and I call it &quot;singlesexschools.org&quot;.<p>5. I display, on my website promoting single-sex schools, the arguments and papers that convinced me single-sex schools were a good idea.<p>Pretty much anyone who possesses knowledge will be able to give you a &quot;stated belief up front&quot; if you ask them about it.

Most notable was when a client paid money onto a Namecheap account (for a domain name) but accidentally missed a sub-charge (and I forgot about it too). This meant that the account balance was a few pennies short of the price of a domain. If I used my credit card or Paypal not only could I end up linking my card with someone elses account but there was also a minimum of $5 charge (you could not add pennies). So I added the remaining pennies in Bitcoins and just a few seconds latter the balance had gone up and I could buy the domain name. :) I had a very good experience and it was a lot faster than even logging in with Paypal. I would also strongly recommend Namecheap to anyone. It&#x27;s a very good company.",1387115919

6909339,comment,6909172,6909172,26,0,silverbax88,,,"This is a dangerous idea. Why? Because it starts with the idea that single-sex schools are better, then proceed to attempt to prove that point with studies that show single-sex classrooms get on average better grades and are more likely to attend college.<p>But attending college and getting better grades is not the goal. In fact, one of the biggest employment and political problems in the United States is due to so many middle class parents conditioning their kids into thinking that going to college will solve their future and guarantee them employment. But, let&#x27;s toss that aside for the moment.<p>The argument on this site begins with a study of South Korea, which randomly assigns students to coed or same-sex schools (we don&#x27;t REALLY know how random this is), and shows data which these students are more likely to get higher grades and attend college.<p>But the real question is NOT can they get better grades - the question is whether there are educational systems that can better prepare students to be a success in LIFE, not just get to college. Do students who attend same-sex schools fare better in relationships, do they push society forward in the underlying principals of a better civilization? Do they make the world better, and are they happy?<p>The real result? South Korea is ranked 111th in the world in gender equality. (For comparison, the United States is ranked 22nd).<p>So let&#x27;s ask something that SingleSexSchools.org will NEVER want to answer - are opportunities for girls in South Korea as good as those offered by men? Is the education of girls in South Korea equal to the education offered to boys?<p>The reality is that South Korea is not just a bad environment for women and girls - it&#x27;s bad and getting worse. Their rankings in these categories were some of the lowest just a few years ago and have steadily declined each year.<p>I don&#x27;t really have time for a point-by-point rebuttal, but the basic point is this: removing diversity never makes society stronger. Are there benefits for single-sex activities and education? Of course. Is it &#x27;better&#x27; to reduce students interaction with the opposite sex to almost none in day-to-day education?

6909321,comment,6906843,6908969,5,0,oneshotaccount,,,"&quot;Underachievers&quot;?<p>My college GPA ended up at 3.1. During the last two years, I got into a pattern of signing up for a full-time courseload and then completely ignoring (and failing) one of the classes (if this happens to you, I can only advise formally shifting to part-time status).  I can provide some observations on particular things that got me through some classes:<p>One class I failed because I showed up on the first day, determined accurately that the subject material was quite easy, and stopped going for a while.  I showed up again in the fourth week of class, and learned that I had already managed a failing grade for myself -- one component of the course grade was a series of four pop quizzes, of which two had already happened, and to pass the course overall it was necessary to pass each component.<p>Since that class was required for a CS degree, I had to retake it.  Having failed it on a technicality pissed me off, so I showed up regularly and was quite vocal in class, and the professor (not the same one) became very familiar with me.  When late in the term I finally flaked on a homework assignment, I felt enough of a connection to him that I spoke to him after class, saying I had been a little busier than usual and hadn&#x27;t done the assignment (I made no offer to get it in late). He whacked me on the arm with the papers he was holding and said &quot;do you need more time? Take another day!&quot;, at which point, obviously, I had to complete the assignment.  I never missed another one.<p>So one lesson is: <i>you will do work for a personal connection that your work ethic would not have motivated you to do</i>.  Wounded pride helps too.<p>I had a class in which I was one of four students.  No real problems there either; it would have been too embarrassing.<p>Lesson: <i>close oversight can keep you working</i>.<p>In one class, I was already established in a flaking pattern when a girl in the class came to me and asked to be my partner (our university encouraged pair programming).  From that point on, I had nothing better to do with my time than work on the class assignments.  Impressing a professor didn&#x27;t register with me, but impressing a girl did.<p>This one is kind of a special case of the first &quot;lesson&quot;, so I&#x27;ll say <i>it helps if the reason you&#x27;re working is something</i> you <i>find compelling</i>.<p>This last point is something I have no personal experience with, but I imagine having friends who thought working on something potentially productive was a fun way to spend time would help me a lot.  &quot;Hey, let&#x27;s take a udacity course together!&quot; &quot;Hey, let&#x27;s learn rails and set up a website!&quot; That kind of thing.

Attending a single-sex school might lead to knowing a little bit more about Plato or the Crimean War (let&#x27;s just concede the point for the sake of argument), but they&#x27;re kind of ignoring the negative impact it&#x27;ll have on the emotional intelligence and gender-relations of the kids who will be stuck in a place where they never get a chance to learn from the perspective of someone of the opposite sex.<p>I would like the article to answer this: how well do the kids in the single-sex schools do later on in life, when they end up having to <i>work</i> alongside people of the opposite sex? What are the relative rates of rape, spousal abuse, divorce, unplanned pregnancy, etc. between adults who came from the single-sex vs. the co-ed schools?",1387113371

I&#x27;d heard of this a couple of years back and didn&#x27;t have the energy for it at the time.<p>Some years ago I spent a serious amount of time reading topos theory, particularly local set theory, as given by the Mitchell-Benabou internal language of any topos, looking for a better approach to description logics.<p>I do believe topos theory provides a better foundations than set theory because the logic is inherently intuitionistic. I found it also provided a simpler explanation of independence results. However one of the things I believe is true of the proof theory is that there is no cut-elimination theorem, which is important to establish a sub-formula property.<p>Sorry to ramble here, let me ask specifically, are there connections between HoTT and topos theory? Or geometric logic? Your earlier comment on the synthetic nature made me think there might be.<p>Thank you<p>Edit: I more or less answered my own question by reading the introduction, the section on open problems, the possible connections are between HoTT and the higher toposes.

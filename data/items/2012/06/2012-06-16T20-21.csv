Classic MacOS didn't use file extensions, programs had a 'type code',  'APPL' (ResEdit allowed you to view those codes and edit the resources within an application). At the time, when we used a short word for software programs, we'd call them 'progs'. This changed when Apple acquired NeXT. The Yellow Box software programs in Rhapsody were the first ones I saw that had .app file extensions, and when I went to a preview of that next gen OS in 1997, Steve Jobs repeatedly called them 'apps'.",1339879984

4121535,comment,4120837,4121463,5,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I do not understand this. You seem to be saying that the more efficient and open the market is, the greater the demand -- even to the point of having employees create holes on purpose (one supposes to be able to sell them?)<p>But couldn't employees <i>already</i> create holes on purpose to sell them? With an open market, perhaps I know that there is a bug in IE that involves flash and allows easy access to root. It just sold at 4 million bucks. With a closed market, I may suspect the same thing, but I don't really know for sure. The thing is, <i>the vulnerability, the market, the sale, and the exploit still exist regardless of whether I know about it or not</i>. The only question here is whether other people are in on what's going on in the marketplace.<p>""The cost to secure a large software project is orders of magnitude higher than the cost to find a flaw and exploit it.""<p>Yes, that is the current state of affairs. But the current state of affairs is that there are all sorts of vulnerabilities that the average person doesn't see. It's not the cost to secure a large project, it's the relative cost to the customer base of the exploit versus the current margin to the software provider. That's the way it should have been working all along. If you sell me a product for a buck and it steals my bank account -- or even if there is a one-in-a-million chance of it stealing my bank account -- I'm not buying it. Right now vendors create walled gardens and put everything in there. What probably <i>should</i> be happening is that separate physical devices should handle different types/values of things. My iPad should probably never both run Angry Birds in Space and control my brokerage account. That's simply too many eggs in one basket. Vendors get away with this because they are trying to hide all of the hidden risks. It's my belief that this practice has to stop. Immediately.<p>Because as technologists we love to generalize we are always trying to create multi-purpose walled gardens. But that's not the way anything else works in the world. My wallet does not also function as a gaming device, something I wave around to exercise with, and a device for meeting girls. I don't take all the physical cash I own to Starbucks and build little towers out of it. We keep things in physically separate areas for a very good reason -- it decreases risk. (And we accept various kinds of risk for various kinds of things) Opening up this market will only cause an evolution that has needed to occur for a decade or more: the end of the general-purpose computer.",1339879336

4121527,comment,4119060,4119437,1,0,Samuel_Michon,,,"Very interesting. However, what I was referring to was that Apple was the first company who launched a marketplace for native software programs, a marketplace carrying the name 'App Store', AND which was integrated in the OS. When we speak of 'the App Store', it's obvious whose marketplace we're referring to, even though other companies have launched similar software marketplaces for their own ecosystems (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Canonical, etc.)<p>That's not to say that the separate components of Apple's App Store were particularly novel. Before its launch, there were package managers, there were online marketplaces for software, and the name 'app' had already been used by several platforms. Apple united those ideas, made it a user friendly environment, made it easy to buy apps with one click (using the credit card that was already on file in iTMS), and integrated the update process. That's often how Apple gets their successes, by combining and improving on existing ideas (see OS X, iPod, iPhone, iPad, etc.)<p>I never used Acorn's Archimedes, but growing up in The Netherlands, the first computers I used were Acorn Electrons, our primary school classroom had six of them. That's how I started programming, in BASIC, at the tender age of 6. I have fond memories of using those machines.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Electron"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Electron</a>",1339879022

When I started regularly sysadmining in the late 80s/early 90s (after being a mere user for the a few years) I found I had to learn ed.  /usr was always a separate filesystem so any time there was a problem booting you didn't have vi available.  If you didn't have at least rudimentary ed skills fixing the simplest problems would be rough.<p>In linux at least the separate /usr never seemed to get that popular.  If you can mount the root filesystem you've got basically the whole OS at your disposal.<p>I will say that learning ed (or, better yet, ex) well does make you a more efficient vi user.  When all you have is command-mode you get very adept at using it.  It's actually sort of fun, too.  Just hit ""Q"" in vim some time and see how you do with only ex commands.",1339878984

I often deal with people from Monaco and work with a guy from Portugal and the difference in culture between southern Europe and here (US/Canada) is striking.<p>It's interesting to see how similar Monaco and Portugal are generally speaking. People from each area seem shocked by the excess we take for granted.<p>Food for example eating out and having a near litre container of sugar water plopped down in front of you doesn't raise an eyebrow here yet S. Europeans (as I call them) seem almost nauseated seeing it. Food is the same pounds of meat and lots of everything else, years ago a family would eat what one person eats today. None of the people I speak with eat after 8PM and most meals are small except maybe noontime, Portugal may be later.<p>I can't see the same results here for legalizing drugs we are a culture of excess, me first, I'm better than you, you-can't-handle-it-I-can kind of culture.

Europe.<p>As for cigarette smuggling not causing deaths, a car bomb going off in downtown Montreal killing an 11 year-old boy because rival biker gangs fight over smuggling turf, strip clubs (prostitution front) is pretty similar.

Type something ridiculous in the Address Bar (Google is trying to rename it the ""everything bar"" or whatever silly name they've come up with).  Put a dot where it does do not belong.  Mistype or mispell something.  Runwordstogetherinalongstring.  What happens?   You get a Google controlled result.  This is not insignificant.  (Sorry for the double negative.)<p>As a knowledgeable programmer, your internet experience with DNS and browsers is very different from others, because you know what you're doing.  Many people do not.<p>Should we teach them?  Or should we try to control them by controlling ""default behavior""?<p>Many people reading HN are probably too young to remember the browser wars and the battle over the ""default browser"" setting.  This is why IE triumphed over Mozilla.  And as any web developer knows, the web has suffered for it.  Users who knew what they were doing could change the default settings.  But that did not make the difference.  Chrome is highly configurable.  But that will not make the difference.  Default settings are what matter the most.<p>The success of ICANN relies on a default setting.  It's called ""root.hints"" or something similar.  If a person running a DNS server (that could be anyone, including the end user) changes this setting, they can bypass ICANN and these landgrab gtlds.<p>In the distant past, ""alternate roots"", an early reaction ICANN's abuse of power, failed because they were trying to do what ICANN is now doing: make money by selling registrations in additional, redundant gtlds.  Perhaps the ""alternate roots"" of the future will be noncommercial ones that subtract gtld's, not add them.  For example, maybe we as smart users will choose to use a ""pre-landgrab"" root that does not have all these silly redundant gltd's that try to capture whatever unorthodox string a novice user might type in a browser.<p>Domain names are important, but always remember that those who seek to control the browser can easily subvert DNS.  Given this decision from ICANN to sell out (which others, not just Google and Amazon, are following: e.g., the founder of BlackHat is running the newgtld program for ICANN; the author of BIND is partnering with a domainer to run a registry), we're going to see some aggressive moves from commercial authors of browsers to control type-in navigation.  Of that you can be sure.<p>Again, the question is whether we want to teach users how things work, or whether we want to let them remain ignorant so we can control them.  In the big picture, ignorance does not help the web.  Though it may benefit certain vendors.",1339877894

Once you make the mental switch from ""CSS is the stuff that I do to make the things that I build look right"" to ""CSS is a component of everything I build"" it becomes easier to see what I mean. It's not about ""I need to be able to reuse this font size"" as much as it is ""I want to reuse this widget when I am display text in this way on any page"".<p>In other words, if you want to build something maintainable, start thinking about all the ways you can help people not write custom CSS at all.<p>Also, LESS and SASS at their core do little to help with this problem, and can even hurt you with unintentional specificity (due to nesting) that hurts reusability. Mixins help you think ""reusability"" but they can really easily be misused in ways similar to how people are misusing CSS right now. This is by no means an attack on LESS/SASS, which I love.

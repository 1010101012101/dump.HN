This would help ""balance"" things out a bit for you, and would give you a more interesting life.  If you take the time to understand and collaborate with your newfound peers, you will also end up with a bunch of great friends whose perspectives are entirely different from your own; this is good for your brain and will keep you from becoming one of those ignorant, boring people.<p>For example, arts school in another country would be interesting.  Oh, and believe it or not, the girls would find it kinda alluring that you're not like the rest of the guys at their school.

The government path doesn't seem to have made a huge dent in the colonization goal over the last fifty years.  It's almost as if we've lost ground since the Apollo program ended.  And the reality of the ""golden age"" of space exploration is that the funding of the program was driven more by the need to beat the USSR than it was by the vision of space exploration as a worthy goal for humanity.<p>As for the private sector, the issue there is that huge profits <i>could</i> be made, but the risks are way too high and the timeline is way too long.  The handful of companies that could afford it are already making huge profits here on earth in things they understand and their shareholders are apt to take a dim view of those companies risking billions of dollars with little hope of return within the next couple decades.<p>Sadly, the best hope for space colonization is either a) breakthrough developments in a tangential technical field that enable cheap access to space (read: nanotech enables construction of space elevator) and/or b) we trash our planet to the point that our survival requires governments to commit everything they have to space colonization.",1231634964
428594,story,,,57,97,recession,"Ask HN: 5-7 months of living expenses left; terrified. Advice?",,"In April, I left my job at a hedge fund. This was, admittedly, not the best time to leave a job in New York, but I needed out because the lack of purpose in my work was starting to affect my health.<p>Even though we didn't ""technically"" know ourselves to be in a recession, I knew something bizarre was going on that summer. I had some really surprising rejections. I never find rejection to be shocking, because even if you're really good, you might not be a fit... but I got turned down for in-person interviews at companies that would have been slam-dunks (for in-person interview) in mid-2007.<p>Anyway, I found my way to a really cool startup and began working there, the only downside being that pay would be deferred until we had funding. I was told that we'd probably have funding by November. I figured January - March was more likely, since PG's essays have educated me on the fact that funding matters are always a lot worse than expected, but I had enough savings from the hedge fund days to hold out that far.<p>It's January. I enjoy the work a lot more than I have at prior companies. The problem is that I have no control over the funding situation, and it's started to scare the shit out of me the minute we crossed into 2009. I only have 5-7 months of living expenses now (<i>fuck</i> New York's ridiculous housing costs). I honestly have no idea what I'll do if this doesn't pan out. I don't want to go back to Wall Street and might not be able to (there may not <i>be</i> a Wall Street). With an imploded economy, even a traditional job search is going to be risky and time-consuming. I don't have any contacts that could lead into consulting projects, and taking a typical software job (Java to implement some business guy's lame vision) is about as palatable as selling out and getting an MBA. I want to stay in technology, but working on cool projects and using decent languages (e.g. Lisp, ML, Haskell... or Python/Ruby at the very least).<p>If the startup gets funding, and it probably will, I'm fine. However, I'm worried about that 1-in-20 (?) chance that we don't manage to line up funding in time, in which I need to do a crash job search in an imploded economy and on shaky ground (and I don't want to do <i>any</i> job search, because I really like the startup and the projects I am working on). It's getting to the point where I hate spending money and I'm delaying necessary expenditures.<p>So, I'm staring down a 1-in-10 or 1-in-20 risk of utter disaster and now that it's 2009 I'm starting to get scared. Has anyone here been through disaster before? How did it pan out?",1231634961

Zimbabwe's whites mostly left, so it is the black population that paid the biggest most terrible price. Naipaul has chronicled this process in his books very well.<p>As a member of an once ""inferior"" race, I can state with confidence that we were not inferior, we were just behind in adopting the institutions and cultural patterns of modernity.

Kicking the whites out took that opportunity away.<p>Yes, none of this politically correct. That doesn't make any of it wrong either. Yes, there are white racists.

It would have been better for everyone if the instigators had been caught and hung.  Instead, they won and set up our current government, so we remember them as heroes.<p>No respectable person believes these last three claims.  Indeed, the fact that I even posted such claims indicates that I may be a barbarian from Digg who somehow found his way onto Hacker News.  There are two possible reasons why these claims seem so repellent:  1) these views really are crazy and wrong, or 2) believing these three things would undermine the legitimacy of our entire government, including its education system.  Thus, via self-selection and overt-selection, no one in the education system or mainstream media defends these claims.  We spend our entire life only hearing one side of the story.

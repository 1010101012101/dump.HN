439291,comment,439282,439282,0,0,zepolen,,,"Very simple and easy to use, I would suggest 2 things though:<p><pre><code>  1. Remove the ajax interface, so it's possible to use the reference offline, also it means you can tell the client to cache the entire thing (as it is static).
  2. Abstract the javascript code into a framework that lets you just pass in a heirarchical js array of definitions.
</code></pre>
In fact, it's a perfect idea for a webapp, you provide the interface, and people can plug in their own 'definition' list for whatever they are working on. So if a person is developing an app, he can document the usage of it in a simple js array and plug it in to get a snazzy interface.",1232283210

  b) they go through the actual signup form which would take about 5 minutes to fill (maybe having to identify 50 photographs, copying a passage of text etc.)
</code></pre>
That would deter spammers, because it automatically limits them to x captchas to break per day.",1232282530
439287,comment,439262,439262,0,0,cx01,,,"I read that argument several times, but always wonder: Shouldn't VCs factor in the subjective risk of the individual venture, like banks do (by requiring higher premiums for riskier credits)?<p>So for example, if a venture has a (subjective) 10% chance of success, the VC should require at least a 10x payoff, but if it has a 50% chance, a 2x payoff would suffice.
Or am I missing something here?",1232282413

439284,comment,433405,433523,0,0,jules,,,"Interesting. Do you have pointers to any papers/implementations of optimizing compilers without abstract syntax trees. Also, are you still able to implement optimizations with the same effort? I'd gladly trade 10x longer compile time for 10% faster execution time.<p>> We can look at specific examples if you wish.<p>Common Subexpression Elimination, for example. Not just syntactically equal expressions but also cases like this:<p><pre><code>    a1 = b + c
    a2 = c + b // eliminated
</code></pre>
And how do you do loop fusion & interchange?<p>Edit: I now realise that we may be talking about different abstract syntax trees. I thought that you meant no intermediate data structures. But you probably meant that you don't need a parse tree, you can translate to the intermediate language directly from the source. If that's the case then here's another challenge: how do you produce error messages for type errors?",1232282336
439283,comment,439235,439235,0,0,zepolen,,,"Number 1 rule for a website:<p>Never change the default UI drastically without either:<p><pre><code>  a) Offering a method to go use the old way.
  b) Doing the change slowly so that users won't notice.

Everyone hates being confused, if tommorow they click something and get a different behaviour - that confuses and annoys.<p>For this change you are suggesting, method b) cannot be used, so it must be a), which adds complexity to an otherwise very simple site for no reason as the functionality to do this already exists.",1232281776
439282,story,,,14,13,dfens,"Ask HN: Looking for feedback on side-project",,"http://langref.net/xhtml<p>Short version:<p>This is what I envisioned as my ideal HTML reference when I was teaching myself web design. I couldn't find something close enough to what I wanted, so I made it and now wonder if anyone else would find it useful.<p>Longer version:<p>This is a side project I've been working on for a little while. The intention was originally to have a complete reference for XHTML that can be viewed as a hierarchy. Starting with a list of all elements, which can be clicked to expand the attributes and other information beneath it. Which can then be clicked to view information beneath them, and so on.<p>As I've gone along I've tried to keep it simple so that it could potentially be used to navigate through other hierarchical information. For example I plan to do other HTML versions and CSS as well, but with some tweaking I think it could be used for non-web design data.<p>It's quite basic at the moment. I have ideas for other features,  like being able to resize column widths and an easy way to zoom in and out. Also, some of the descriptions I've added are a bit rushed because I just wanted to see what it would look like finished.<p>Would anyone else find this kind of reference useful? Or have any other thoughts/suggestions?<p>(Note: only tested in Firefox, Opera and IE7. IE messes up the widths.)",1232281691

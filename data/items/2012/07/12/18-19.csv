I was meeting someone for beers in town and wanted to map out how long it would take to walk there. I looked and looked for a Maps choice in the home UI and I couldn't find it. I stood there for 3 minutes, scrolling up and down and nothing. Instead, there was AT&T Navigation (I didn't need navigation.. I just wanted some walking directions as an overview).

Modeling is an estimation of how something works, but it isn't the mechanism by which something works.<p>The current state of software patents results in people filing three sets of claims: the invention itself, a method that implements the invention, and a computer system that implements the invention. The rationale is that if invention claims (complicated math) are not enforceable, method claims might be, and if neither of those are, perhaps claims that mention hardware claim might be. You'll note that none of these motivations are strong, and that's because it has been left up to the courts to decide, and there is very little case law around software patents since everyone settles out of court. We think they are patentable because someone decades ago successfully enforced a patent regarding computer controlled curation of plastic.<p><i>Complex software that solves some real world problem shouldn't be disqualified on these grounds, since it is almost of exactly the same nature as hardware that achieves the same goals.</i><p>What makes complex software more valuable than simple software?

4236033,comment,4235432,4235782,44,0,tolmasky,,,"This is not just a bug in some feature that used to not exist, this is a regression that Apple took upon themselves completely consciously.<p>""Full screening"" existed before Lion. It worked fine. You could for example run Quicktime or iTunes full-screend in one monitor and do work on another. Then, in Lion, solely to be able to market it as a new feature, they tweaked it to conflate full-screening with spaces and broke the feature for many people that had been happily using it for over 5 years. They could have just added the existing full-screen behavior to the iLife and iWork apps and things would have been fine. They didn't. It is clear that Apple knew they were going to break this feature for people, and did it anyways. (For example Quicktime used to have an option in preferences whether to black out the other screen or leave it usable, this preference was removed in Lion -- someone literally went in and deleted functioning and better code -- this was not some ""whoops"" mistake).<p>On top of this, what is particularly infuriating about this is that it hurts the people that have invested heavily into Apple by purchasing more than one monitor, many times <i>expensive</i> Apple monitors. It is completely acceptable and expected for people to get angry about regressing their monitors' abilities. Maybe its not a show-stopper for you, but for people who have spent a lot of money purchasing monitors, and had an existing workflow that functioned for YEARS, to all of a sudden lose it to a paid upgrade is 100% what I would call a show-stopper. Especially because it has been a year now and it is clear Apple just doesn't care about this.<p>""Well Apple is just more focused on the single screen experience now and you're just not important anymore"". Bullshit. They repeatedly advertise, and continue to advertise the expanded capabilities of, multiple monitors: <a href=""http://www.apple.com/displays/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/displays/</a>. The Air + Secondary Display is widely used, and most the laptops now support more than one external monitor. Thunderbolt even added daisy-chaining of monitors. This adds to the absurdity and schizophrenic nature of the issue: many pros use multiple monitor setups, and yet Apple went into the pro apps and degraded them to now only work with one monitor in full screen mode.<p>Of course, this shouldn't be surprising, its really a microcosm of the entire Lion release: very little to no new functionality and instead unneeded ""tweaking"" of existing behavior. We paid to have our scrollbars made to look like iOS and have everyone learn to ""reverse"" their scrolling, for Safari to perform the worst its ever performed (I don't think I know anyone who uses it anymore), and to have full screen broken.",1342119072

Most of them seem so incommensurate with what they purport to be studying as to be nearly trivial. The researchers rarely seem to address (or even be aware of) the assumptions they're making, and their assumptions are usually significant enough to dominate the data.<p>That's not to say one can't extract value from such studies, but what the value is is so open to interpretation that everyone ends up relying on their pre-existing preferences to decide the issue, which defeats the purpose.<p>Edit: that study on code cloning that AngryParsley cited above is an example. They make some good distinctions among reasons why programmers duplicate code. But their empirical findings are dominated by their own view of what's valuable vs. not. They admit as much:<p><i>Rating how a code clone affects the software system is undoubtedly the most controversial aspect of this study, and also the most subjective.</i><p>I have mixed feelings about this study. On the one hand, it's good to see people working diligently to study real codebases. At least someone is <i>trying</i> to look at data. On the other hand, how they're interpreting it is no different than what we all do when we argue this shit online or over beers or  more to the point  when hashing out a design decision. This isn't science, it's folklore with benefits. The problem is that it's being shoehorned into a scientific format it can't live up to.<p>Their title, by the way, is a straw man. What they're really arguing is that not all forms of code duplication are equally bad, that some are good choices under certain circumstances like platform and language constraints. That's reasonable (if bromidic) and even interesting, but it's just musing. It's not at all up to the authoritative status that AngryParsley gave it; it merely looks that way because it was published in a journal. The reality is that they have an opinion and looked at some code. At least they did look at some code.<p>Nobody is going to change their mind because of such work, nor should they. It isn't nearly strong enough to justify throwing out one's own hard-won opinions-based-on-experience-to-date.  The net result is that everyone will look at it and see what they already believe. For example, I look at it as a Lisp programmer and the examples seem almost comedic. It's obvious that in a more powerful language, you could eliminate most if not all of that duplication, so what the paper really shows is that language constraints force programmers into tradeoffs where duplication is sometimes the lesser evil.

I find the concepts of modes jarring, even antiquated. Everyone who has used vi(m) has copied and pasted text in while in command mode and done who knows what.<p>Emacs is better in this regard but I find Emacs's need to consecutive key presses (or a key press followed by a command) to be longwinded.<p>The advantage of either is they're easy to use over ssh+screen (or tmux) for resuming sessions.<p>That all being said, give me a functional IDE any day. IDEs understand the language syntax. Vim can do a reasonable job of this. Emacs (with elisp) seems to do a better job (or so it appears; I'm no expert) but IDEs (my personal favourite being IntelliJ) just make everything easier. Things as simple as left-clicking on a method and going to its definition.<p>For statically typed languages (eg Java/C#), IDEs (quite rightly) rule supreme. Static code analysis, auto-completion, etc are just so much better than text-based editors.<p>Dynamic languages are more of a mixed bag and its certainly the norm for, say, Python and Ruby programmers to use one of these.<p>Still, give me an IDE any day.<p>One objection seems to be that people don't like using the mouse.

4235818,comment,4232044,4233714,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"The form of this argument ""if Y goes no more X"" is very common in disruption scenarios, it is always wrong. But the reasons its wrong are not always obvious.<p>When you have a market (and in this case its Television) there is an 'eco system' which develops to support that market. So for television you get producers, production companies, set dressers, directors, writers, actors, distributors, advertisers, and about a zillion other various bits. They all live and die in the 'value chain' which is the fundamental product being delivered to and then consumed by its customers.<p>Now disruption comes in two flavors, you can disrupt the eco-system and you can disrupt the product. If you disrupt the product, the product dies, the eco system tries with varying levels of success to adapt to adjacent markets. If you disrupt the eco system, parts of the eco system die and other parts replace it.<p>But lets use an actual example for a minute. I was recently in Maine at the Maritime Museum there and they chronicle the rise and fall of the Maine sailing ship business which peaked in the 1860's and then was demolished by the the switch from wood hulled to steel hulled and sail powered to steam powered ships after the American Civil War. At no time was the world ever at risk of not being able to get 'quality ships' but the <i>kind</i> of ships people bought, and how they were made, changed dramatically between the 19th and 20th centuries. Granted that buying a 'tall ship' has becomes something of a challenge since they aren't generally built these days, buying a 'ship' is pretty straightforward.<p>So back to your comment about losing 'expensive and well written shows.' I do not believe that this disruption has changed the desire for quality, episodic entertainment. Rather it is changing the eco-system around how it gets made. You start getting people like NetFlix buying TV shows rather than television networks, or Kickstarter type funding drives.<p>The eco system is changing on content. But I don't think we'll lose quality in the process.",1342116856

4235739,comment,4224873,4231587,2,0,tptacek,,,"So, I'm not defending anybody.<p>Like most people who actually pay some attention to what happened in finance, I trace much of the problem back to deregulation and poor enforcement.<p>The parties who successfully rolled back regulation made a grave mistake, and should bear the consequences of their terrible judgement.<p>Similarly, the people who today suggest that regulation isn't the answer, but rather that we should simply let failed banks fails, those people are making today's grave mistake. The people who argued that systemic vulnerability would prevent any failed bank from actually failing were, as I see it, obviously correct. As it turns out, we can't even let a single auto company crash, let alone a nationwide megabank.<p>Having said all that:<p>It does us no good to pretend that the other side of this debate isn't a ""side"", but rather a bought- and- paid- for theater role occupied by those lucky enough to receive lobbying dollars.<p>The reality is that it's an animating principle of roughly half the American political establishment that regulation is bad, and that its unintended consequences will tend to harm the economy more than crashes will. A pretty large subset of those people also believe that however painful a megabank failure is, it's survivable, and one or two of them will suffice to teach CEOs not to allow their companies to gamble to the brink of failure.<p>It's no surprise that this half of the establishment receives truckloads of money from financiers; their principles align with the lobbyist's interests. But attributing those principles to the lobbying contributions is an instance of the post-hoc fallacy, unless you genuinely think that finance subcommittee legislators, Republicans, and pro-business ""new Democrats"" really don't believe in deregulation.<p>I can separate the bad principle from the ""influence"" here, is all I'm saying, and having done so have started to conclude that maybe the influence is a red herring in this case.<p>Lobbying ""influence"" is bad for all sorts of other reasons! Most importantly: because it consumes gigantic amounts of time, time that could be spent grooming a staff that could have some hope of understanding the issues they're dealing with.",1342116076

As far as above and beyond, you're definitely right. It's all relative. If that part of it bothered me anymore, I'd probably look to make some changes, but oddly enough, I enjoy it, so it's not too big of a deal to maintain that kind of turnaround time.<p>For us, the biggest change was adding an awesome system admin to the mix on retainer.

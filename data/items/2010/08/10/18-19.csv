1592539,comment,1590524,1591161,0,0,Gormo,,,"Paper has been around for centuries without significantly changing in form or function.  Over that time, many stable conventions evolved for organizing information on paper and using paper as a medium communication.<p>Its digital equivalents are still immature - we don't yet have common expectations of how we share the same types of information digitally.  The underlying forms are still changing rapidly, and the decisions we make in how we communicate are therefore more coarse.  We don't think about the minute details of how we put out different bits of information in order when we first need to settle whether we're going to use email attachments or files on Dropbox or Google docs, or send an IM, etc.<p>Eventually, conventions will stabilize as certain types of information become strongly tied to particular methods of representation and communication.  Once those become stable contexts, we will be able to vary the more minute details within each context to carry metadata in the same way Tufte does with paper.<p>This situation demonstrates an interesting (current) weakness with using technology to manage information.  When your organizational systems, methods, and conventions are <i>purely</i> conceptual, it's very easy to change and adapt them in real time, allowing for a gradual evolution of processes, and progression towards nuanced equilibria.  But when we rely on software, we may often need to write new code to support a new idea - we increase the upfront investment needed for experimentation, often drastically.  And people who are non-technical can't experiment and adapt on their own at all.  Until most people can adapt their digital tools as easily as their physical ones, it may take much, much longer to optimize their effectiveness.",1281465860

Our joint proposal takes the form of a suggested legislative framework for consideration by lawmakers, and is laid out here. Below we discuss the seven key elements:<p>First, both companies have long been proponents of the FCC’s current wireline broadband openness principles, which ensure that consumers have access to all legal content on the Internet, and can use what applications, services, and devices they choose. The enforceability of those principles was called into serious question by the recent Comcast court decision. Our proposal would now make those principles fully enforceable at the FCC.<p>Second, we agree that in addition to these existing principles there should be a new, enforceable prohibition against discriminatory practices. This means that for the first time, wireline broadband providers <i>would not be able to discriminate against or prioritize lawful Internet content, applications or services in a way that causes harm to users or competition.</i><p>Importantly, this new nondiscrimination principle includes a presumption against prioritization of Internet traffic - including paid prioritization. So, in addition to not blocking or degrading of Internet content and applications, wireline broadband providers also could not favor particular Internet traffic over other traffic.

It was pretty sweet.<p>Not to say you don't deserve it, but I would not really consider doing ""above average work"" to be a good enough reason for a big raise.  A small annual one, sure.  I would think you'd need to be taking on additional responsibilities.  Assuming you're doing that, then I think you should be able to make a compelling argument.  Also, since you know that you're underpaid, you could bring that up as a point.<p>Whatever you do, don't make it into a threat that you will leave if you don't get the raise.  If they say no, just ask what steps you can take so that you WOULD be worth $10K more money to them.  If the answer is ""nothing"", then get the hell out.

The app/idea solves a problem for a large and growing market and has a definite built-in audience.  There are already competitors but they aren't very good and don't really capture/display the information in a functional way.  I'm sorry that I'm probably sounding cagey/shifty, but truthfully I think its something that would be really easy to build and a great, marketable product.  With some of the programmers here I have little doubt that we could have it built and live in a month after a couple of hours a week of work.  Enough of the preamble, here's the idea.<p>On the backend:  We extract location and timing data from schedules or twitter feeds ->  We use locations to ""pin"" those things on a map.<p>As for the app:  On startup we check the user's location then display (on the same map) the pins closest to them.<p>There's a bit more I've worked out as far as design, implementation and extra information that we would want to provide, but essentially thats it.  I'm looking for anyone with great skills/experience and an interest in food (of any type), slight preference might be given to folks in Boston and/or LA but thats only so that we could chat/work in person.  Everything else can be done from wherever and on whatever schedule you'd like.<p>If you'd like to chat, drop me an email (joshua.snyder(@)gmail.com) or post a comment, I'm looking forward to it.

I had similar weight loss result on both types of diets, but my blood panels were dramatically better on a low-carb diet. I'd also add that I never felt hungry on a low-carb diet, while I was constantly hungry on the low-fat, calorie-restricted diet.<p>I find the main difficulty with low-carb diets is that they are boring. Our society does not cater to them. Ordering at restaurants and eating lunch with your workgroup when meals are brought in ase challenging. There's also a lot of social pressure around dessert (parties) and alcohol.<p>Unfortunately - at least for me - cheating on a low-carb diet is a major setback because it can set up a cycle of hunger that take at least a few days to get out of. Low-fat diets aren't the same, mostly because you are often convincing yourself to be hungry all the time anyway.",1281464157

In other words, their analysis indicates that once carbohydrate intake has been restricted to a certain level, further restriction may have no impact on weight loss.<p>They did not compare carbohydrate restricted diets with any other form of diet, and therefore cannot draw any conclusions regarding the relative effectiveness of carbohydrate restriction and any other diet.<p>Their analysis also reveals the lack of published research performed on carbohydrate-restricted diets over the past few decades.  This fact is also unsurprising to anyone who has read GCBC.<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17507345"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17507345</a><p>The abstract does not indicate to what degree, if any, caloric restriction was used.<p>Compares a ""low glycemic load"" diet with a low fat diet; does not examine carbohydrate restriction.  Note that the low glycemic load contingent was still receiving 40% of calories from carbohydrates.<p>This study also appears to have examined LDL without regard to LDL composition (small/dense vs. large/less-dense).<p><i>Confused?</i><p>No, not really.<p>My understanding is that a carbohydrate-restricted diet:<p>- Will promote weight loss without hunger.\n- Will increase HDL levels (good cholesterol).\n- Will decrease triglyceride levels (very, very bad stuff).\n- Will increase LDL levels.  LDL is ""bad cholesterol"", BUT...\n- ...small LDL is correlated with CHD, and is not increased by a carbohydrate-restricted diet, AND...\n- ...LDL in general is much less important than HDL and triglyceride levels as a risk factor for CHD.<p>Both your citations and those of the OP have either been irrelevant to these points or have supported them.",1281463703

1592381,comment,1590503,1591646,0,0,Locke1689,,,"Sorry, fell into a little philosophical opaqueness there. Platonist is meant to refer to the ancient philosopher Plato. What he may be most famous for is his theory of Forms. The idea is that there are two worlds: the material world which we can perceive directly and another realm that is ""intelligible"" but not directly perceivable. We can refer to these as the sensible and supersensible realms. The supersensible realm is accessible through thought and abstraction: it is a world of perfection. It is this realm where perfect circles and shapes and ideas lie. In the Republic, he uses the allegory of the cave to describe the relationship between the supersensible realm and the sensible realm. In a sense, the sensible realm can be imagined as the shadows of figures on a cave wall, where we are unable to turn around and see the figures themselves and only to perceive their projections into the sensible realm. The most modern reinterpretation of Plato's philosophy is present in Judeochristian philosophy. Many would go so far as to say that Christianity is simply a dressed-up reinterpretation of Platonism.<p>My second section was meant to deal with a proof of God's existence known as the ""Ontological Argument."" I'm going to reproduce it hear and quote liberally from Wikipeda (I'm kind of lazy):<p><i>1. If I am thinking of the Greatest Being Thinkable, then I can think of no being greater\n1a. If it is false that I can think of no being greater, it is false I am thinking of the Greatest Being Thinkable\n2. Being is greater than not being\n3. If the being I am thinking of does not exist, then it is false that I can think of no being greater.\n4. If the being I am thinking of does not exist, then it is false that I am thinking of the Greatest Being Thinkable\nConclusion: If I am thinking of the Greatest Being Thinkable, then I am thinking of a being that exists</i><p>I know that you are not attempting to prove the existence of God, but the argument bares some similarity, simply replace ""Greatest Being"" with ""Perfect Circle."" If there is no circle more perfect then, by the same argument, such a circle must exist. The trouble is this argument is deceptively simple. Bertrand Russell notably said, ""The argument does not, to a modern mind, seem very convincing, but it is easier to feel convinced that it must be fallacious than it is to find out precisely where the fallacy lies.""<p>Perhaps my favorite refutation comes from David Hume:<p><i>[T]here is an evident absurdity in pretending to demonstrate a matter of fact, or to prove it by any arguments a priori. Nothing is demonstrable, unless the contrary implies a contradiction. Nothing, that is distinctly conceivable, implies a contradiction. Whatever we conceive as existent, we can also conceive as non-existent. There is no being, therefore, whose non-existence implies a contradiction. Consequently there is no being, whose existence is demonstrable.</i><p>In this way we can see that conception (of a form or of God or of a mathematical concept) does not lead directly to any statements of existence or non-existence: they simply ""are.""",1281463259

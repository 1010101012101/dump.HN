429916,comment,429477,429477,0,0,jmackinn,,,"I am a huge fan of Excel.  It's the program that I use most for doing work.<p>At the entry user end, there are so many features that are simply unusable or technically way to difficult.  For the power user of Excel, there is very little that can't be accomplished.  It's power is basically limitless with VBA (or choose your favorite scripting language).  Apart from the comment suggesting larger sizes to the sheets (larger than 1 million rows) and being online (something that would really not fly in most corporations) I can't find a problem in here that can't be accomplished with Excel and a firm knowledge of scripting for it.  This may be a cop-out though as you must actually script the stuff yourself.  This, however; is why I love this program so much.<p>So as for building a more powerful spreadsheet program for the power user market, it's going to be very hard for anyone to produce something that does more because it's already basically limitless.<p>For the novice user though, the program is convoluted, confusing and extremely limited.  The novice user also represents a much bigger market.  I have had several jobs simply because people couldn't do things in Excel that I assumed a monkey could do.  Companies love Excel even though 99% of employees at them have no idea how to do basic things with it (summing columns for example).  Giving some of the 99% of employees a program that they can do basic to intermediate things without having the limitless back end scripting power would put me out of many of my jobs.<p>Excel at the start is like a country kid visiting the big city for the first time.  There is just way to much power in it and the map for getting around is far too confusing, but once you've been living there for a while everything about it becomes a breeze.  Making that adjustment easier would be a huge benefit.<p>On a side note I enjoy using Google Spreadsheets but one of my top wishes is that Google, or someone, would implement either a Google scripting language or a allow for other scripting languages (Ruby, Python, VBA) to be used.",1231721480

429909,comment,428785,428785,0,0,netcan,,,"I think it is important to look at what I see as the two main sides of 'libertarianism'.<p>-The Moral Argument-<p>Libertarianism is about rights & opposing coercion. Other people & by extension governments should stay out of other people's business. Don't tell me where to work or what to do. Don't tell me to wear a seatbelt. Mostly that works fine<p>-The Economic Argument-<p>There is the second argument that (when it being criticised) gets called 'idealistic' or 'religious.' This is the idea that by not intervening in peoples' lives & by extension in companies, everything will work out good. Markets will function better. Economic output will be higher. Public good would be increased. This relies on economic theories, theoretically anyway. So far, most countries are really a balance here.<p>These are seperate & the arguments for them are seperate. On the first, I am pretty clear where I stand: I agree mostly with the libertarian position on personal rights. I am against drug/alcohol/seatbelt/smoking/exercise bans, prohibitions or requirements. I am willing to relax that if the negative public effects are substantial & prohibition side effects are less substantial. So if we legalised drugs & found we ended up with a severe amphetamine problem, I would consider reinstating the prohibition.<p>My biggest problem is the welfare approach. For a similar reason to the amphetamine prohibition above, I think that welfare/health is essential & should be provided by the state. If it is provided by non-state bodies to a sufficient level, the state doesn't need to do it. I would even extend that to international welfare.<p>The economic arguments get very technical. It is also an area where theories are rarely good at being predictive. I see the connection between the moral & economic theories. But I am not as worried about the rights of a corporation as I am the rights of an individual.",1231721272

429898,comment,429028,429510,0,0,tptacek,,,"Obviously, you know this stuff better than I do (I've been following you for awhile), but for what it's worth, here are my initial reactions to your post:<p>(1) Ruby and ObjC have inconsistent syntax, which among other things is the reason we have that crappy snake-case encoding. This is true, but like I said, Cocoa's nomenclature is already so bad that wrapping everything in Ruby idiom was a win for me<p>(2) Ruby/Cocoa has to bridge Ruby types (Hash) to ObjC types (NSMutableDictionary). It's true, but this is only really painful if you're using the bridge ""bidirectionally""; the real win is to stay in Ruby, and use Cocoa like a library, not a second programming environment.<p>(3) Ruby and ObjC have overlapping libraries, like ActiveRecord and Core Data (or a million smaller examples). With the exception of Core Data --- and in retrospect I wish I'd stuck with ActiveRecord --- I just stick with the Ruby side and use Cocoa only for appkit. Just like above.<p>(4) Ruby and ObjC are storing redundant objects. The bridge makes this transparent. If I cared about performance, I wouldn't be in Ruby at all.<p>(5) Ruby and ObjC have totally different memory management schemes. Part of the point of writing Ruby is not to have ObjC's memory management headache, which the bridge takes care of, but I admit that I could find out 6 months from now that that was a bad assumption.<p>(6) You can't call Ruby from multiple ObjC threads, or really using ObjC threading at all. That would be a problem if I was writing substantial amounts of ObjC code, but I'm not. (I'm also an async bigot, so I avoid threads anyways).<p>(7) If a Ruby name clashes with an ObjC name, you have to preface the ObjC name with oc_ to call it from Ruby. This does not bother me at all; isn't it exactly what you'd expect when merging two independent environments?<p>I'm sure this stuff kills you if you have a complicated ObjC/Cocoa application and you want to extend it with Ruby, or if you want to do a Tcl-style integration with Ruby glue code and ObjC engine code. Also, I am totally biased, because in my consulting life I've spent years in Ruby/DL and Win32 doing my own manual bridging and runtime code generation; Ruby/Cocoa is a <i>dream</i> for me. =)<p>Nu is really cool. But none of my code is written in Nu.",1231720735

Because your actions affect me. The fact that some geniuses at Citibank and others screwed up makes it harder for me to switch jobs, means raises are going to be nil this year, etc. The freedom they had took away freedom I had. And so it becomes a balancing act and often I get lectures about freedom as if it isn't such a balancing act.<p>To be clear, the items you state here aren't _rights_.  Rather, they're privileges that aren't guaranteed.  If you work and do a great job, you're not entitled to a big house in the suburbs, but you're increasing the odds of being able to afford it.<p>The Constitution guarantees rights to life, liberty, and property, as well as several other rights in the Bill of Rights and other amendments.  But nowhere there will you find a right to have a job or right to make x% interest in the stock market (or right to be bailed out if you get in over your head in the real estate market).<p>As a nation we have a real problem of mistaking opportunities for rights, and feeling entitled to things that we want.",1231720510

I think that regardless of the posted speed limit, some people will not exercise the proper judgement because they have evaluated the conditions differently.<p>In the example of reserve funds, imagine a world with similar information asymmetry to today. Banks are semi-transparent, and deposits are backed to some extent by the FDIC. However, the SEC takes less of an active regulatory role, the result of which is that some unscrupulous banks have started offering insanely high interest rates based on dangerous fractional reserves. People will likely flock to those banks, especially given that the FDIC is backing their investments... and then the whole thing collapses.<p>One solution is to get rid of the moral hazard inherent in the FDIC, and make it clear that the only way to hold your money safely is in cash, in your home. But one of the signs of civilization is increased specialization of labor; I should not have to do the job of banker and regulator all rolled into one, just to have a place to keep my money. Worse, it's not even clear that this is possible, because of inherent information asymmetry.<p>We can argue about whether an adequate ad-hoc bank insurance solution would arise, however, I'm not sure that such an invention would increase efficiency in the market.<p>As for regulation, there doesn't really seem to be any real alternative, unless the direct consequences for the operators of failed financial institutions became much more dire.

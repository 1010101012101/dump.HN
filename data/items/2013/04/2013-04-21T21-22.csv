5586615,comment,5585590,5586405,1,0,estavaro,,,"With eval language designers might have a delayed execution that could make compile-time optimizations less straightforward. Part of the toolset could have to be present during deployment time to be able to handle eval which happens at runtime. And yes, security concerns could also play a hand.<p>In Dart the code declaration is taken very seriously in many ways, and avoiding eval buys them more compile-time, loading-time and perhaps runtime optimization opportunities. I find that more than the language designers themselves, it's the end-users or developers that ask for more ""bondage and discipline"" from their tools. People who come from Java and C++ backgrounds, for example. They just can't have enough compile-time stuff aided by an IDE.",1366581559

All I've seen so far as far as company tumblr's go are Denny's and National Geographic so I don't think I could make a valid assertion on the subject.  I know that company Twitters usually seem very hollow so I'd love to be pointed to some great company tumblrs if you have them!  I thought about your second point, but I personally determined that the intense amount of customizability wasn't a real reason for tumblr's success with its user base.  Many tumblrs use the same 20 themes and those who overly-customize it lead down a MySpace-esque road.  I've actually found myself being more annoyed with the immense amount of customizations.  Please remember that I wrote this in an attempt to understand why users used tumblr, not discussing every aspect of the site.

5586596,comment,5585397,5586114,2,0,eatitraw,,,"In Russia, there are ballot boxes that automatically count ballots. No fancy technology here - they just scan ballot, detect mark position, and after the end of the election day these ballot boxes just print resulting report.<p>These ballot boxes are installed on some small percent of polling stations(like 5% or 10% - I don't remember the exact number). But statistical analysis shows that electoral fraud is commited considerably less often on such polling stations. I don't know, whether it is actually more difficult to cheat on such stations(at least there is a physical limitation - you can't put more than one ballot at a time, because it is needed to be scanned, - as opposed to normal ballot box where you can easily put 10-20 ballots at once), or whether they decided to install such automated boxes on polling stations where they had no intention to commit fraud. But my point is:
1) ""Paper-voting"" is no guarantee of fair elections. 
2) Sometimes ""hi-tech"" may even help you, if you use it properly.<p>You make a fair point about electronic voting(and I wholeheartedly agree with you), but it looks like you overestimate the reliability of old-fashioned methods.<p>To summarize, I'm calling you ""not-enough-paranoid kook"". :)",1366581291

Thus anybody can verify the totals.<p>If anybody's recorded vote on the website (taken by hashing their info) doesn't match their receipt, fraud is caught (thus removing votes or changing votes isn't possible). Also, if I didn't vote or am dead, and my info is entered, we can verify no tally appears for my hash.<p>If the hashes don't match up with all the registered voters via registration forms, then votes have been added. Thus in order to add fake votes, fake voter registration forms must be filled out manually [leaving a paper trail to catch the perpetrator].",1366581148

Previously there was a specific 'DeathAdder' utility which, as you said, didn't require any online junk. But they completely removed it from existence once their port of the Windows software left beta or whatever.<p>I did try installing a copy of it that i had saved from before, but it seems that the act of installing the new software somehow broke the ability to use the old one, and i didn't want to spend hours fucking with some mouse driver.<p>> You realise you don't need the software right? You can use the mouse perfectly without it.<p>No, you can't. Or i can't, anyway. The default tracking is unusable to me (i like it much slower and smoother-scaling than most people seem to), and OS X's tracking slider didn't help.

Additionally, the buttons would be recognised incorrectly unless you told the software what you wanted them to behave as.<p>> I have never experienced this problem.

Basically, you are asked about the number of ""fair and square"" numbers in a certain range, over and over again, in 10000 different cases. He could have just taken his solution, pre-generated all those numbers once and then ran all those test cases by counting in that pregenerated list, instead of generating it for every single test case(all 10^5 of them). It turns out, that in the whole span of 1->10^14 there is only 39 such numbers and it would've taken his program probably less than a minute to generate all of them(I'm being generous here, since it ran 10^5 test cases in 53min).<p>In fact, if you read the problem analysis later provided by google you will see that in fact you were <i>expected</i> to make this optimization to solve the problem.

These people don't feel like they can talk to people in the real world, their counselors and family don't understand so they come online for their fix of advice and help, to actually feel wanted and loved and cared for.<p>This is something which websites like Facebook and Twitter tend to miss, for better or worse, our profiles there are normally tied to our identities, we can't talk about these private things because then people in our real lives will know our most inner most fears and troubles, the sick people behind our normal exterior, so they use Tumblr to express this part of them.",1366579926

Because social app plumbing is getting pretty cheap and easy to pull off at scale with IaaS.</i><p>Huh?  IaaS does not provide users which is the basis of social, anyone can write code which implements a social network, getting users is the hard problem.  The problem App.net is trying to solve is to provide a social network that app makers <i>can trust</i>.  Currently you can get awesome functionality from Facebook or Twitter, but as Twitter have shown so publicly, they will only tolerate you as long as they perceive you as providing a net benefit to them.  If they see you as siphoning off any potential revenue for them you are dead in the water. Obviously Facebook is not quite as outwardly belligerent to it's developers, but the same rule applies.  App.net addresses this by aligning it's business goals with the apps on its platform making money.<p>Now obviously App.net doesn't have enough users yet for it to provide the value that developers get out of major social networks.  However App.net has a lot more tractionespecially with developersthan the majority of attempted stand-alone social networks.  What they need are a few wedge apps to create a virtuous cycle that attracts the attention of more and more serious commercially-oriented developers.  It's a tough row to hoe to be sure, but they've been putting one foot in front of the other and I don't see them as being anywhere near failure yet.",1366579781
5586480,comment,5585397,5585397,1,0,chacham15,,,"I've had the following idea for a while and was wondering if anyone can point out the flaw:<p>Imagine a system where every individual has their own public/private key pair (backed by tying it to their SSN). You then have two SQL tables:<p><pre><code>    CREATE TABLE voterVote (
        id           INT,
        category     VARCHAR(255),
        vote         VARCHAR(255),
        PRIMARY KEY (id,category)
    );
    
    CREATE TABLE voterVoteId (
        voter_id     INT PRIMARY KEY,
        voter_city   VARCHAR(255),
        vote_id      INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES voterVote(id)
    );
</code></pre>
Both tables are published. The one thing I forgot to mention though is that the vote_id is encrypted with the users public key. This way any individual voter can check that his vote is what is should be and people on the whole can check that votes were tallied properly. Furthermore, we dont need to worry about hacking compilers, etc. because this can be done on the internet. The last thing we need to worry about is that the machine is lying to people when they go to check their vote. The only solution to this is to have the code which decrypts the persons row in the voterVoteId open source, but still since the protocol is open source and the data is open source, we can bet that there exists one honest person to build a tool to check. One more thing: how can we tell that extra rows werent added to VoterVote? We can check that the number of people in a city matches the number of keys issued to every person in that city (which again is backed by SSN).<p>This will probably fail miserably at something simple I've overlooked, but it was fun to dream up :)",1366579776

There's a limit of 100mg potassium per pill, but afaict there aren't any controls on buying the supplements in bulk, so you could order thousands of the pills if you wanted. The total-quantity limits seem to only be on things where the DEA has gained some authority over the substance.",1366578756

Until then, it's available to everyone, but they must help pay for the drugs development.  If nobody pays, the drug isn't developed, and nobody gets any benefit.<p><i>It's far more important that we move to a world in which all human beings have access to basic sanitation and healthcare than it is to spend billions of dollars attacking statistically rare diseases producing medicines that will help only a few rich people.</i><p>Would you die for that?  You expect others to, no?  That's kind of totalitarian.  At the same time, this argument is fallacious in the sense that it assumes we should address no problem until the lowest level problem is solved for everyone.  That's undesirable for a large number of obvious reasons I will not bother enumerating.<p>Do the  ""few rich people"" that are helped not end up paying for the R&D of the treatment for everyone else in perpetuity?<p><i>In fact, I'd go one step further and argue that your statement is actually false in the long term. A world where all humans have access to good healthcare and education would actually be a world in which more people contribute to research and development of new drugs and one in which knowledge would advance faster.</i><p>That's a nice thought.  Unfortunately, there is a huge advantage to not paying development costs, in that you can externalize them to others and reap the benefits, which is what many countries, including India and the UK, have chosen to do.  In India it's ignoring the patent, in the UK it's setting a price ceiling, which effectively shifts the burden to the US since the profit maximizing strategy is still to sell the drug in the UK because marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost.  If the US stops paying, the drug never gets produced, or gets produced much later because there is no private incentive to produce.",1366578711

Could  this be a desirable feature?<p>I don't really know of any tool that may be useful, I don't think that Microsoft project could really fit, it is too complicated for the task IMHO. I it should be something with this features (maybe not, Just guessing!):<p>- A version control like git that allows to save procedures, sub procedures, edits, comments, explanations or technical discussions that are not included in the ""printed"" version, informs and a tool to navigate all of them visually.<p>-User management: be able to have your own user, so as to have your edits in your account. Be able to follow another user or group of users.<p>- Word editor template a la google docs, that allows to see both EVA procedures, but with some excel like capabilities, like creating a time line(rows). Steps (cells) that can have a relationship with other cells from the same EVA(column), with the other EVA, with mission control and/or self properties (like tool to be used, comments, reports, etc..)<p>-Possibility to save sub-procedures to be used again, insert them in a different mission, also must have the possibility to be branched in a new mission to modify them. Also be reported, comment/discussion timeline, etc...<p>- Be multi-platform: laptop/PC/mac/linux, tablet, print format, and also HUD appliances(google glasses), (so the astronaut is able to scroll and read while on the vest).<p>-Also I suppose that multiple views of the same procedure must be possible, like simple, expanded, annotations, reports, versions, missions, incidents, warnings...<p>I don't know if a software of this kind could be created from parts of open source programs like open-office, git, etc.. or it must be created from cero.<p>Edit: typos.",1366578685

5586415,comment,5585590,5586171,15,0,pak,,,"> it is very reasonable to code that part in some fast language while delegating the bigger (and often more complex) part in a higher level language such as Ruby.<p>Agreed. Contrary to what lbrandy said, I've tried it, and it works very well.  Writing Ruby extensions in C, or wrapping C libraries for Ruby, is really easy.  Wrapping a PNG library for Ruby allowed us to draw about a trillion pixels' worth of images based on the human genome across a modest cluster of ~100 cores in a few days [1,2,3].  For reference, a terapixel image is about ~4TB of uncompressed data and ~800GB compressed, with Microsoft putting up comparable numbers for a project they ran on a fancier HPC cluster in 2010 [4].  We were heavily compressing it into PNG tiles on the fly so ours came down to ~60GB.<p>Regarding pointers to pointers to ints--if you keep all the data within the heap of the Ruby extension, as we did with the wrapped PNG library, then it can be stored in whatever simple data structure you want.<p>[1] <a href=""http://chromozoom.org/?db=hg19"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chromozoom.org/?db=hg19</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/rothlab/chromozoom"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rothlab/chromozoom</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/3/384.full#sec-3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/3/384.fu...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/terapixel/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/terapixel/</a>",1366578655

Then explain the reasons for needing an hourly assessment: lacking functional specification, requirements, etc. - making it impossible for me to determine an accurate project timeline.<p>I include a few points that can help them clear up ambiguity in their project requirements, and generally offer an hour of project review as a complimentary service.<p>On this call (or meeting if they are close), you can quickly determine if they are just trying to get a free hour, or if they are genuinely interested in a more experienced consultant who can really help them with their project.<p>My experience is about 25% of posters will respond to such a bid/proposal.  Of those 25%, about 33% are actually looking for assistance and open to paying for experience.<p>Notes:  I moonlight, and usually bid on projects for which I estimate 40-120 hrs of work, and they are generally in the realm of system administration, database optimization, and php (often on shared hosting).

When it ultimately comes down to it, you shouldn't be competing with the $10/hr crowd.<p>Clients that understand the importance of good design and solid code knows that it costs money and they're willing to pay for it. Clients that think $10/hr is a normal rate are probably bad clients with an unrealistic expectation of how much work it takes to produce a good website. They'll be late to pay and double the scope of the project.<p>When I freelance, I usually go through a talent agency. This guarantees payment, the clients are usually much bigger and the projects much more exciting than mom and pop stuff I'd find myself or on those freelancing sites. With them, I'm getting at least $35/hr full time for the period of the project. Sure, not as high as my personal rate when I deal with clients directly, but I enjoy the peace of mind that buffer provides. Plus working through an agency, I never run out of work because it's their job to find work for me. I usually go back and froth between agency and direct work.",1307195162

One stack will have 150 flaky looking quotes to do the whole project for $300, none of which stand out as inspiring much confidence.  The other stack will have a single well written proposal, quoting a bit more than he'd expected to pay, but clearly from a guy who has done this before and can do it again.<p>His choice is now:  Sift through that rubbish pile and hope I get lucky, or go with the expensive guy.<p>That's a pretty good place to be.",1307193391

Our approach has been ""The OS is our VM"".<p>We use mmap() heavily, and when running on 64-bit systems take liberal advantage of the giant address space.  Using the system to do more of the buffering also allows us to have lightweight processes that can start quickly.  We think there will be both speed and memory advantages in the long run. The other main difference is that C is much easier to integrate with other languages than Java.  We're starting out with Perl bindings, but have plans for Ruby, Python, Lua, Tcl, and others.  The goal is to offer a truly native interface from the language of your choice.<p>The degree of host language integration is wild.  You'll be able to seamlessly subclass just about any part of the C library in any supported language.  Nothing is ready beyond C and Perl, but eventually you'll be able to have your indexer in one language, and your customized searchers in a couple more, while all sharing the same shared system cache.<p>As for why?  Marvin, the main developer started the project as KinoSearch at a time when Lucene wasn't really ready for prime time.  He's been very interested in real time indexing, and at the time Lucene didn't handle this well.  I got interested because I was looking for something lighter weight than Lucene, where I could try to blend the boundaries between search and database retrieval.  Lucene had too many layers of abstraction for my purposes. A parallel might be SQLite and Postgres.  Both have their place, but Lucy is more on the SQLite side of things.",1307193375

I&#x27;m certain I can&#x27;t generalize across the board, but typically my assumption would be that the person who is &quot;better&quot; or more experienced with certain things are getting the more difficult cases, and so perhaps by either separating them with a &quot;senior&quot; or &quot;specialist&quot; title and different pay scale they&#x27;re not being graded on the same curve as people who are handling the more routine cases.<p>Ultimately I think those edge cases can be fleshed out and monitored with regular auditing.",1441727981

10186461,comment,10185435,10186206,0,0,ufmace,,,"Based on my personal experience, I wouldn&#x27;t second-guess how people choose to get the most out of classes.<p>I find that really paying attention to something over an extended amount of time is hard work. Very few lecture subjects and presenters are genuinely interesting enough for it and paced well enough for it, and it also requires a certain amount of energy, which I may not always have, or have for long enough for the whole thing. So I often try to find a way to have something mildly to moderately distracting while in these lectures, like a newspaper or magazine or something. I often find computers and TV shows to be too distracting, such that I may not really hear anything, but the mild distractors help keep me focused enough to hear the important parts without my attention drifting away entirely.<p>But I also haven&#x27;t been to any lectures in a long time, because I think that they&#x27;re a terrible way of conveying information, mostly because they force a lot of people to all share the same pace. If something was paced just right for me, then it&#x27;s probably too fast and hard to follow for some people, and too slow, boring, and tough to stay focused on for others.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s also possible that the student just doesn&#x27;t care at all, and is only there to get the piece of paper, which he has been told will automatically lead to a good job.",1441727946
10186460,comment,10185435,10186303,0,0,mercer,,,"There&#x27;s no reason why MOOCs can&#x27;t be effective in the humanities. I think the problem is that there&#x27;s much less overlap between those who are skilled at teaching, say, history and those who are skilled at creating good online courses.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed this same lack of overlap in the field of journalism. I know quite a few people who are really good (and successful) in their field, but despite being in their late twenties or early thirties, they&#x27;re shockingly inept at operating computers.<p>This is a problem, in my opinion, because much of what (specialist) journalist do is find the story in high volumes of data. And computers are great for that: RSS readers, DEVONthink (or other personal databases), good google searches, collaboration through, at the very least google docs, etc.<p>And yet they settle for ordering books, reading huge stacks of newspapers, cuting out the good articles and writing in their paper notebooks, and composing word documents that they send around via email with -2 added to the filename.<p>But I digress. My point is that there&#x27;s significant low-hanging fruit in combining technology with the &#x27;stuffy&#x27; areas of academia or fields like journalism, but relatively few people from either side collaborate in this area.<p>In part, I think this is because of a fundamentally different personality/temperament and social surroundings, and in part I suppose it&#x27;s because this &#x27;low-hanging fruit&#x27; is not low-hanging when it comes to profit. That saddens me.<p>But the fact remains that if I as a data/tech/web geek were to &#x27;fuse&#x27; with one of my journalist friends, great things could happen. While such a &#x27;fusion&#x27; is unlikely, I&#x27;m still trying to find a good starting point for collaboration.",1441727940

Only HFT systems could have cheaply dealt with this new complexity&quot;.<p>In any case, I&#x27;d sum it up as &quot;it is cheaper to trade now after the rise of HFT than at any other time, at least some of that is because they can market make more efficiently than a dude in a vest&quot;.

You didn&#x27;t have time to think about what you were doing, was it the right thing, was it what you wanted, etc...<p>This is a great point and one I think clearly happened to the author and to a lesser degree myself.<p>I was all about going into academia, being a professor, travelling the world on other people&#x27;s money and studying romantic cultures in far away places. I was warned about the environment then (early and mid 00&#x27;s) and the lack of pay, but I wanted to experience it so bad. I had blinders on and all I wanted was my doctoral degree and then kickstart myself into a PhD program.<p>I burned out in epic fashion and took a few years off and regrouped. In the meantime, a half dozen of my friends graduated and landed teaching jobs, and others started in their doctoral programs. Within a year, they were all out. Either pivoting and going back to school for a completely different major, or pivoting into some other field and out of academia completely.<p>I was lucky and avoided most of it - but without my burn out, I&#x27;m afraid I probably would have been in the same place as the author. Without a real examination of where I was going and what I <i>really</i> wanted to do with my life, I almost lost several years finding out academia really wasn&#x27;t the place I wanted to be.

You shouldn&#x27;t use ECB mode with any cipher because it is not semantically secure. This is Crypto 101.<p>In addition, it&#x27;s a bit wacky to use RSA encryption on your entire message because RSA operations are slow and you are limited to encrypting messages that are the length of your RSA key (well, minus the padding, which is how this developer arrived at the &quot;split plaintext into 214 byte chunks&quot; workaround).<p>A better solution (in every way) would be to use a &quot;hybrid&quot; encryption scheme, similar to TLS or GPG. To do this, you would:<p>1. Generate a random key for use with a symmetric cipher (e.g. AES-256)
2. Encrypt the plaintext with the random key, using a secure block mode (e.g. CBC, CTR)
3. Encrypt the random key with the RSA public key
4. Package those things together and share it on Github<p>Efficient and secure. Also totally unnecessary (you basically just reinvented a subset of GPG) but that&#x27;s neither here nor there.",1441727205

Not just that I could shop around for rotator cuff surgery or a hip replacement, but actually interesting stuff that&#x27;s only done internally right now.<p>If prices were published then someone could track the prices of a great many procedures and look for procedures that were getting cheaper.  You could then interview people at institutions that are able to do those procedures less expensively and publish it.  Other institutions might then follow suit and the savings could be shared widely.  The lessons might cross boundaries and spark other folks to recognize that X is very similar to Y and they can use the same lessons to make Y cheaper, easier, more foolproof, etc.<p>Further, with reasonable pricing information and some measure of quality it would be pretty easy for people (and perhaps insurance companies) to encourage medical tourism of a great many varieties.

Sometimes, the nylon is replaced by CNC-machined aluminum (at higher materials cost--maybe $2 instead of $0.10), and that part will never need to be repaired again for the lifetime of the vehicle.<p>Such one-off manufacturing moves the market from zero competition, where the market can be manipulated and controlled, to a more competitive model.  Even if the original manufacturer can create a replacement part at 1% the cost of a home-repairer garage-manufacturing a part, the threat of it places an upper limit on what the business can charge for their officially sanctioned repairs.<p>It is the manufacturer&#x27;s refusal to sell those parts at a reasonable price that creates the market opportunity.  Every complete new watch must necessarily contain working parts.  So someone buys one, takes it apart, makes detailed photographs, and discovers the means to duplicate the parts.  It&#x27;s not whether the parts <i>can</i> be produced at lower cost, but whether they are made available for sale by anyone at lower cost.  If it costs you $20 to make a part that <i>can</i> be produced at $0.02, it hardly matters to you if the only way you can get that is by paying $100 and shipping to and from the factory.",1441726735

It might also assign a severity level. Based off of the DRG and severity level and the negotiated fee schedule a price will be assigned. This price might be a per day amount or a price to cover the entire span.<p>So you have an added layer of abstraction between what the service is costing and what the hospital is being paid.

- Start with the known non-master key

The real issue is that having a backdoor makes a new class of attacks possible. A wilful or accidental leak, for example. Or you can reverse engineer the master key if you have enough locks.<p>The big impact is that one leak kills the security of all locks (of that type).<p>I don&#x27;t think this would necessarily be the case when looking at (publicly) backdoored encryption. Here, you could have an individual backdoor key for each &quot;lock&quot;. Of course, the mass storage of backdoor keys make a mass-leak also more probable.",1441726287

By professor standards, which admittedly aren&#x27;t that high, I could rock the mic.

As an example one theoretical reason you didn&#x27;t mention is changing bandages twice as often reduces post-op infections by 75%, although no one has discovered or proven that yet, its sounds possible, and post-op infections are expensive and painful compared to cheap bandage replacement.  Minimization of cost of any random individual component almost always doesn&#x27;t result in minimization of total system cost.<p>Its important to build robust fault tolerant fail safe systems.  By definition, half of all management will be below median.  A system designed to give the bad ones maximally overpowered weapons to wreck havoc is not a good system design.  Numerology as a weapon can be destructive.<p>It seems reasonable that as a system it might enable the top half of managers to take three steps forward, while enabling the bottom half of managers to take five steps back, not forgetting the fixed cost due to documentation and processing labor (bean counting) and micromanagement somewhere around a fixed two to four steps back just to gather and process the data, regardless if its used or not.  That&#x27;s a badly designed system.<p>This is before design criticism along the lines of never implement a system more complicated than its minimal need.  Simplicate and add lightness.

Or you are specialized in knowing as much as you can in every field to build something out of it. So or you are specialized in a field like deployment (AWS, boto, Chef, docker, kubernetes, Mesos... and the list goes on), or like front-end (React, bootstrap, CSS3 reactive design...), or iOS app, back end, databases... Or, you are specialized in connecting all these dots. And this is a full stack developer.<p>Just knowing how to do the &quot;operational details&quot; is a job in itself. It&#x27;s a job to work on very specific things at Google/Apple/FB, and it&#x27;s what they need the most: developers who are the bests in their field. On the other side, it&#x27;s also a full time job to know how to build a website with RoR with a RDBMS db and cache db, maybe on AWS, and even with some React in it. It&#x27;s already quite a lot. And this is more what startups wants. Or at least a few of these people as a team leader or working closely with every person in their team to connect their dots, to design the app/web app/web site as a whole.<p>Now yes ask to a full stack RoR dev how to design and code a database and he won&#x27;t know, ask him even how to do specific things on AWS and he may not know either. But he will know how to design and build the whole product from A to Z, and to manage people doing what he can&#x27;t do. And at the opposite ask an expert in iOS apps how the back end really works when he sends a request to their Restful API and he won&#x27;t know. Same thing for someone specialized in the back end and you ask him something about React. Both are specialised in one stack.<p>Or you want to master specific tech/stack/field and you become specialized in one of them, or you become broader and broader and you become a full stack developer. It can be full stack dev in iOS (so maybe with some NodeJS in it to do Restful API), or as another example a full stack dev in big data (so I guess: Python Luigy, MapReduce, Spark, Redshift, Scala, Java, AWS...). At the end of day our time is limited and we can&#x27;t be specialized in everything so if what we love the most to do is to use<p>Personally as a full stack dev, I am like a small CTO and can be one. I love to have the whole picture in my mind and to know how everything works together on a higher scale. I love all these tech around (AWS Boto, Docker, Vault, Consul, Spark, ML...) and I am like a kid who with a new toy when projects like these ones come out. I prefer to read an articles on Highscalability.com about Airbnb or Uber and do the same, rather than crunching SQL requests.",1441724402

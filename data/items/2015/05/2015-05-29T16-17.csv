My father owns a property with an easement, purchased from an attorney who worked in easement law, in a different jurisdiction:  this man himself mistook some points of law, and last minute paperwork was required.  At several levels of government, various departments use maps that clearly indicate (incorrectly) that my father does not own the easement, and the city at one time attempted to suggest that it was frontage.  And this is regarding an easement whereupon there is a well-established thicket, not a road.<p>This brings me to the consideration that real estate agents are not lawyers, and that legal status of the easement might have been unclear or incorrectly represented when the purchase was made.  Also, I think that if the road was being treated simultaneously as a liability and an obligation by whatever mix of regional law pertained, a legal confrontation would be completely understandable.<p>I do not know or assert that any of these things are the case, but I know that easements are complicated beasts, and that a simple violation of contract may not be the only explanation here.",1432918681

It seemed like an assembler language for cluster computing: something for raw efficiency or to hold us over until we get a <i>real</i> language. I was playing with Cilk and other parallel tools then. <i>Much</i> better but little adoption or optimization.<p>The examples given in Spark and Chapel show how much better it can be. Such methods deserve much more investment. The bad thing is that the DOE labs are clinging so hard to their existing tools when they&#x27;re in the best position to invest in new ones via huge grants they have. They built supercomputing before anyone heard of the cloud. Their wisdom combined with today&#x27;s datacenter engineers could result in anything from great leaps in efficiency to something revolutionary. Yet, they act elitist and value backward compatibility over everything else. Starting to look like those mainframe programmers squeezing every ounce of productivity they can out of COBOL.<p>I think the change will have to come from outside. A group that works both sides with funding to do new projects. They either (a) improve MPI usage for new workloads or (b) get the alternatives up to MPI performance for HPC workloads. Then, they open the tool up to all kinds of new projects in both HPC and cloud-centered research (esp cloud compute clusters). Maybe the two sides will accidentally start sharing with each other when contributing to the same projects. Not much hope past that.",1432918270

The generational hypothesis means that most objects die young. Allocating them is a simple, uncontended pointer bump in the thread-local allocation buffer (as fast as stack allocation), and freeing them is free, as they are never traversed. They are much, much (much) faster than malloc/free. They do however increase the frequency of young-gen so they have an indirect cost.<p>When it comes to throughput (i.e. total time the application spends doing memory management), modern GCs handily beat malloc/free. What you can do, however, with manual memory management is all sorts of arena allocations, but then you have to be careful when sharing pointers (Rust helps with that). Then there&#x27;s the question of concurrent data structures, that are very, very hard to do well without a GC.<p>> cache line misses hurt.<p>What does that have to do with GCs? If anything, copying GCs bring related objects together, so the prefetcher can help.

The reason hiring people is expensive is largely because of the regressive (ie: not scaling with the wage) taxes and insurance premiums.  <i>Those</i> are why any given employee costs something like 40% <i>on top of their actual pay</i> to their employer.<p>And by and large, much of what&#x27;s &quot;bought&quot; with those fees and taxes <i>just doesn&#x27;t fucking work</i>.  Pension taxes can either go up for low-wage workers (precisely where they impact low-wage employers <i>more</i>) <i>xor</i> they can stop topping out for well-off professionals (and instead scale linearly or progressively with income).  Health, life, and disability insurance should be consolidated into a more efficient public system.  Company-provided 401k&#x27;s are often basically just a handout to mutual-fund companies (that is, the fees take away from contributions but the investments don&#x27;t perform better than a random walk).  We can switch people over to firm-independent IRAs or some other supplementary pension system to increase efficiency, and give the gains back to workers as pay rises.<p>Also, getting rid of the minimum wage - or any other measure designed to decrease mechanization and increase the usage of low-wage, low-skill labor - is <i>exactly the opposite</i> of what should happen.  Public policy should never be written to deliberately hamper productivity growth in the name of increasing human toil!",1432917593

We’ll be offering developers the ability to download and build apps for &#x27;Simulator only’, completely free. Publishing to the App Store will require the purchase of a license.<p>This is us: http://www.getredbeard.com (still under construction)<p>Option 1:
A perpetual license based on a one off license fee. Build and publish as many apps as you like.<p>Pros:
- Traditional model and something developers are used to.<p>Cons:
- Piracy, serial keys all over the internet pretty soon.
- Very little flexibility in pricing which could potentially result in us launching at a price that is prohibitive for a certain demographic.<p>Option 2: 
Licenses are not tied to a particular developer but rather to an App (Via Bundle Identifier). A license is required to publish the app into the App Store. At the point when they’re ready to publish their App they’d log into the Redbeard website and claim the key by entering the App Bundle identifier.<p>Our thoughts on a tiered pricing model are as follows:<p>Tier 1: One off App - Cheapest option and perfect for indie Devs. Gives a developer the ability to purchase a one off license. 
Tier 2: Freelancer - Developer given a bulk allocation of 6 serial keys that they can claim as and when needed for each App project.
Tier 3: Agency/Organisations - Larger bulk serial key allocation, 20 serial keys.<p>Pros:
- Prevents Piracy
- Allows us to offer a tiered pricing model, as one size never fits all, thus allowing us to target a range of the developer demographic.
- Gives us the ability to later adjust tiers based on market demands.<p>Cons: 
- Potentially unfamiliar licensing model and thus feels complex.
- The need to login to the Redbeard website each time a Key is needed for a new project.<p>We’d really appreciate any thoughts on this or anything related to our website or framework.<p>Thanks",1432917584

9625532,comment,9624987,9625348,0,0,eli_gottlieb,,,">Aside from these core issues, I&#x27;d also speculate that a tremendous quantity of money is trapped in financial instruments. If it&#x27;s in a financial instrument, it isn&#x27;t exactly employing people or building goods or creating demand for goods. The same could be said about the billions of dollars held close to the chest by the oligarchy.<p>We can further unpack the huge amounts of money trapped in financial instruments.  There are really two functions for financial instruments: investment in productivity growth, and rent extraction.  The pool of capital for private-sector productivity growth is glutted; in fact, it&#x27;s being <i>held back</i> by stagnant consumer demand and high rents.<p>So beyond stagnant consumer demand, we&#x27;ve got a lot of rent-extraction (asset and real-estate bubbles being created to extract resource, information, and land rents as debt-service or legal expenses) and a major dearth of productive public-goods investment (public health (ie: vaccination and disease prevention), infrastructure, education, etc.) loading down the economy with dead-weight losses.<p>(We can also simplify our model by construing capital/labor bargaining as capital owners extracting a rent from laborers for usage of their capital, ie: money, machines, land, etc.)<p>>There&#x27;s a huge opportunity here to have a government public works program or some other major initiative to mobilize the underclasses, but it won&#x27;t be taken.<p>The basic problem is that many, possibly even most, of the rent-extractors adding dead weight to the economy are using their wealth to buy themselves government policies favorable to rent extraction rather than wealth creation and distribution, ie: further neoliberalism.<p>Let&#x27;s be frank: an economy in which the workers are healthier and more educated, the work is more mechanized, and collective problems (like transit, urban development, and disease control) are handled collectively is more productive!  It outputs more stuff!  So you don&#x27;t have to be a socialist like me to realize that <i>reducing the net output of the economy</i> to enrich a few people at the top is a bad idea!<p>You just have to use accounting metrics that don&#x27;t count increased rents as growth.",1432916733

I mean, he was eating 500-600k a year without complaint maintaining the property for the public. That&#x27;s pretty generous. Seems it was a dispute over parking and fees...and considering how trivial $2 is compared to the 500k+ he was already paying it just feels like there&#x27;s a bit more to this story than &quot;Koshla is an evil 1%&#x27;r&quot;.<p><i>edit</i><p>So, it was exceptionally hard finding anything from Khosla himself on the issue. But I did find a few more details on why the beach was closed.<p>So, when he got the property he allowed the same access as the previous owners. Which was generally accessible during the day, but typically closed at night, during bad whether (often during winter), and when &quot;inconvenient&quot; which I assume is when property managers were on vacation or whatever. This level of access has been confirmed by the previous owners, the Deeney&#x27;s, in their court testimony.<p>So, for some unknown reason, the county issued an order to the property manager for them to a) reduce parking fees to $2 (which is what they were in the 1970&#x27;s) and b) to keep the gate open 24/7.<p>Khosla&#x27;s managers/attorney&#x27;s/whatever thought this was a significant historical change in access policy and so fought it, closing the property until the dispute was resolved.<p>I got all this from the following article: <a href=""http://www.mercurynews.com/san-mateo-county-times/ci_26166316/khosla-sounds-off-martins-beach-slams-news-coverage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mercurynews.com/san-mateo-county-times/ci_2616631...</a>",1432916521

The kids (~20 altogether!) are wonderful: well mannered, eager to learn. So my frustration is extreme when I see the material they&#x27;re being force-fed. The school follows the ACE (&#x27;Accelerated Christian Education&#x27;) curriculum. It&#x27;s imported from the USA, and teaches that the Earth is 6000 years old, that there was a Great Flood, and that evolution is evil. The textbooks are seething with pseudoscience - from illustrations of humans coexisting with dinosaurs, to articles connecting snakes to the serpent from the Garden of Eden, and so much more...<p>The real problem is that Ofsted - the UK government&#x27;s regulator for standards in education - has consistently given the school a &#x27;good&#x27; rating. (WTF???) Worse yet, the accreditation offered by the school - the ICCE (International Certificate of Christian Education) - is actually considered by UK NARIC (the &#x27;designated National Agency responsible for providing information, advice and expert opinion on qualifications worldwide&#x27;) to be &quot;comparable to the overall Cambridge International O and A Level standard respectively.&quot; (Again, WTF???)<p>Since the government has utterly failed these student victims, I figured that perhaps an appeal to rationality might get somewhere. So, a few weeks back I had a 9 hour(!) meeting with the school principal and her husband. It failed, and perhaps I came close to being asked to leave. But I&#x27;m diplomatic (and valuable), so I&#x27;m still there.<p>Since then I&#x27;ve devoted many hours to Bible study, and research into the arguments of Creationists. (Remember: one can&#x27;t engage with these people using reason or rationality. <i>Know your opponent.</i>) I strongly feel it&#x27;s possible to convey to them the vitality of Science - that it&#x27;s one of the holiest of human endeavors, to be blessed rather than reviled.

Because, even with iterative/agile development, a week out can likely be considered in-scope (or close enough).<p>So, narrowing the timeline so dramatically fundamentally changes this entire discussion. YAGNI&#x27;s statement implies that there&#x27;s a reasonable degree of uncertainty with regard to the features you&#x27;re considering. However, there is generally much less uncertainty about what you&#x27;ll be building in the following week. The requirements are essentially known for all intents and purposes. So, at that point, it&#x27;s more like, &quot;I Know We Need This&quot;, because you&#x27;re essentially driving it from the current requirements.<p>So, I think the real determinant is whether you&#x27;re looking at current requirements, vs. trying to anticipate future requirements. If you&#x27;re doing the latter then, I think we just disagree.<p>And, if your experience is that extrapolating  requirements far off into the future has been helpful on average, then we have definitely worked on different kinds of projects.",1432915577

That&#x27;s a recipe for failure.<p>> Its self-serving to stick a dialog box in somebody&#x27;s face<p>Yes, that&#x27;s the point. I want their email addresses.<p>> then spend 100&#x27;s of words defending that choice by denying the obvious.<p>Frankly, you cannot argue with the effectiveness of popup email collection. Every time we blast our 150,000+ email marketing list (mostly gathered via the popup as well as other means), the websites are almost crushed under the traffic load. 1 email can generate $10&#x27;s of thousands in revenue... so yes, collecting emails is of very high importance for us, and many similar ecommerce companies.<p>> are not about the visitor gaining value by reading a blog entry<p>You are certainly right -- it&#x27;s more about the company gaining value, however, a great many of our customers gain value by seeing deals on products they are interested in. That is a win-win for everyone.<p>> And those who object to the process are &quot;not my target&quot;.<p>If you aren&#x27;t buying something from my site, or clicking an ad, then you are not my target. Instead you are just consuming my company&#x27;s resources and ultimately won&#x27;t convert into a sale. To be frank, we don&#x27;t want those types of visitors on the website, although it&#x27;s unavoidable (ecommerce generally considers an average 3-5% conversion rate to be good).<p>The point is, you are annoyed by popups, and choose to punish sites that employ them. Just like some choose to punish sites that provide free content but pay the bills with ads. It&#x27;s a strong bias to impose on the rest of the internet users... especially when you are in the minority percentile.",1432915576

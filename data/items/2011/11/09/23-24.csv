And it's ridiculously high, beats any property tax in U.S. That's probably one of the reason why the Chinese government is so rich.<p>The propaganda has invented a new saying, calling this the Chinese Socialism, and it tries to credit itself for the economic boom after the 1980s. We the people think that the gov is just trying to collect massive money after they abandoned soviet communism so everyone had a chance to make a better life. The chance is getting slimmer as the gov is getting much more greedy than in the 80s.",1320883178

I kind of chuckled at the iOS statements about Flash, but it seems to run OK on every mobile device I ever got to try it on.<p>Potato, Potatoe.<p>If browsers are the new Universal Interface to conquer and standardize, there's a new problem. We now have variety in implementation of standards, making those standards tough to use.<p>Where Flash was when it was 2-3 years old isn't much different than where HTML5 is for those of us who have been around long enough... except there's a lot more browsers out there than there were Operating systems.<p>Flash could control how efficient it was, or wasn't.. but who will make sure all the browsers process HTML5 efficiently?<p>Are we really aware of how much we're going to get ahead, and how soon?<p>How much time will I spend recreating what Flash, or something else could do for me already today, so I'm not just trading some great HTML5 features for spending my time coding stuff Flash has?<p>I don't use a ton of Flash or HTML5 right now and don't foresee it.  When it's the best tool, I use it.  Where it's not a complete tool, I'll think twice.<p>This is one area though, where Adobe's expertise might be second to none -- making it work identically everywhere as best as possible with gracefully degrading libraries.<p>I hope their recent acquisitions serve as fuel for solving a problem really needing solving.. by them or someone.<p>Should be interesting to see what happens when we get what we wished for, the devil we don't know vs the devil we kind of did.. :)",1320883148

There's some negative sentiment towards Kaggle, but much less, and much of it boils down to, ""meh, I don't consider it worth my time, but if others do, that's their decision"". I'm guessing it's mostly a question of economics; ML consultants don't feel like spec work threatens to seriously affect their pay, while designers are more worried. Photographers seem to be at the far end, with photography forums full of all sorts of crazed ranting, some even claiming that people who CC-license photos and upload them to Wikimedia Commons are unethical.",1320883097

I'm pretty sure most people's hatred of Flash comes from ads that are not only annoying and poorly coded, but embedded with opaque or transparent. Then they will melt your laptop, yes.<p>It's easier to hire for, HTML/CSS/JS are more common skills than AS, especially when you're not hiring to do 'push movieclip around' Flash, but working inside a huge Flex app with 90% custom in-house components. It's also easier to find people who might not have a lot of development experience but are good at pushing around html and css to finetune the interface to our designers' desires. Maybe that got easier in Flex in Flex 4 with the Spark components, but we weren't allowed to drop support for Flash 9 despite it being less than 1% of visitors, so we were still on Flex 3.<p>Downsides:<p>Performance. Holy crap performance. The flash site still ran well in ancient browsers like IE6 and IE7. The new site struggles in IE7 and we had to drop support for IE6 entirely (performance was not the only reason there but, you know). And on the subject of mobile, the flash site was sluggish but technically worked on my Nokia N800 tablet running Maemo. New site doesn't. We're working on making this better, of course, but the new site was written pretty quickly and accumulated a ton of technical debt, mostly in the form of poor performance tradeoffs.<p>Stability. Ditto what I just said about IE6 and IE7. And now throw Opera in there too. jQuery eases a lot of cross-browser pain, but not all of it. The edge cases in which Flash behaves differently on different platforms are just that, edge cases, and usually occur when you have to cross the boundary into JS. So now instead of basically one platform to test your code on you have...well all the major browsers * all the major OSs.<p>Maintainability. When your application is pushing the 100k LOC mark, strict typing is a godsend. So are real namespaces, and interfaces. It is very very easy to write stupid code in JS. You can write stupid code in any language, of course, but at least in Flash the compiler will yell at you if it's blatantly incorrect, and exceptions throw useful stack traces on all platforms. I don't know what it is about JS and swallowing errors, but sometimes it's a battle just to figure out where in the code you need to even start looking for the error. Or that an exception even occurred.<p>I guess I should make a blog post about the switch someday...",1320881755

It would be hard to build social apps on an application layer that didnt transcend physical platforms, because then there would be platform-induced delineations between the social groups that could congregate.<p>But the other motivating factor is that web apps by definition are a centralized container for the data you put into them. You use Freshbooks and you can access your invoices from anywhere. I think this will become far less important as cloud-storage-on-the-desktop services like iCloud mature and largely eliminate this advantage of web apps.

But beeing a ""lender of last resort"" is quite diffrent then what the fed did. They literly flooded the hole bankingsystem with cash, knowbody knew what was going on, how will be saved who want, witch banks acctully are still liquid and witch will bust when the flow of cash stops. Why should banks lend to each other if the get free money. If I would get free money, I too would just sit around and wait until the worst is over.

Usually they'll have all the caffeine you need, but having a clear mind really helps you keep going at 3am.<p>Talk to a lot of people (everybody) when you're there. Hackathons are a great way to meet intriguing people and discover new ideas.<p>I don't like losing, especially where I have damned good control of the outcome! Here are some tips for actually winning!<p>Make a workable demo<p>One huge mistake that most every team makes is that they aim too big, then realize there simply is not enough time to realize that vision, so they start cutting features at the last minute just to have a workable demo. Instead, prototype an MVP, test it, then add features if you have time.<p>Test your demo<p>The judges and people in the audience are going to want to try your demo out. Give them a working URL that shows off the functionality you promise.<p>List your challenges<p>I always hate talking myself up and making it seem as though some problem really wasn't too difficult. At a hackathon the other day, one of the judges asked what the hardest part about building our app was. I answered, ""building it in 10 hours."" Wrong answer. Instead, I should have already thought about what the hardest part was and included it in my slides.<p>Don't go first<p>Going first in most any presentation sucks. Judges have no idea what to expect of any other hacks, so they give wildly varying point spreads. Try to go second or third. In these positions, you can look better than the previous presenters, and also still make the more mundane details of your hack look new (for example, with data api hacks most teams will use the most data heavy table. If you go first, you look the best).<p>Avoid sitting near judges<p>You probably have an opinion on each of the hacks being presented, and it is in your best interest to keep those opinions away from the judges. If you're impressed by a hack and a judge hears you express such, they probably think you yourself don't think your project is as good. Conversely, if you denigrate the presented hack it makes you look jealous and spiteful. Either way, you lose.<p>Have a full presentation<p>Spend a little time working on your presentation. I'm not advocating a fully polished presentation with a video demo, bios of each team member, etc., but make sure you have a few slides and you know the order of them. I try to stop hacking about 30 minutes before presentations so that I can think about the best way to showcase what I spent my time on. The slides I usually have are:<p>* Title, My Name<p>* Problem<p>* Solution<p>* (Demo, actually do the demo)<p>* Language and APIs<p>* Challenges Overcome<p>Avoid talking about Version 2<p>You know how many people continue working on a hackathon project after the hackathon is over? Nobody. Ok, maybe a few hacks are continued (GroupMe, Kindlegraph), but the vast majority get dropped before the first round of after-hackathon beers is downed. When you show a slide with your Version 2 roadmap on it you look disingenuous. Instead, highlight the awesome stuff you managed to crank out during the hackathon and go in-depth on how each of your features works and why it is beneficial.<p>Tell a story<p>You're told this all the time when asking how to pitch bloggers and connectors. Same concept applies in your presentation. Tell where your awesome idea came from (who thought of it, how did it evolve?). Describe the situation where a make-believe person would use your hack.",1320880838

Prices for the ridiculously named &quot;Gigapower&quot; are undoubtedly going to go increase repeatedly over time if Fiber backs out since it has achieved what it wants. Competition would have the opposite effect.<p>Or better yet, why not treat ISPs as utilities.

That&#x27;s because for many Chinese people, Mandarin isn&#x27;t their mother tongue - other Chinese dialects like Wu, Yue, etc. [1] As the BBC article you linked states, this is an issue of &quot;linguistic unity&quot; more than a symptom of a bad education system.

It makes up one or two of my meals each day. I&#x27;ve got to say, I really really like it. I think it has a good chance of catching on.

I can imagine it replacing those aisles and aisles of junk, easy food (cereal, canned soup, mediocre pasta).<p>That said, I quickly had to come up with a better name than Soylent.

People I know in SF encourage me to drop out all the time, and I know of several college students that dropped out.<p>Edit (reply to below): I took a year off to work before I went to college, so I think I have a good perspective when I say this. You assume that: 1) college is going to educate someone about the world, get them a good job (not a measly startup job), give them discipline, and introduce them to cofounders; and 2) college will do this so much better than you could by working in industry that it justifies the cost (anywhere between $150-200k tuition for a good school, and possibly $200k in lost savings).

From the article itself: &quot;To the average user, the URL is noise.&quot; In other words, if you assume that they already can&#x27;t understand URLs/aren&#x27;t bothering to, then what&#x27;s to say they&#x27;d be able to notice the difference between a real URL and a phishing URL in those examples?

Now hiding the path to &quot;prevent phishing&quot; has the completely opposite effect! You could argue that this is an edge case, but it still seems to be an awfully discriminatory practice to me; I personally have password-protected accounts on various servers where the login is located at somehost.com/~myusername , and a phisherman with somehost.com/~otheruser could do this quite easily with hidden URL paths.<p>The real solution to preventing phishing? <i>Education.</i> Educate the users. Empower them with the knowledge to understand what URLs are and how they relate to where they are on the Internet. We should not continue to keep them ignorant, as they will become even more so, and that will have negative effects on the future of the Web and continue to propagate the notion that computers are &quot;impossibly difficult to understand&quot;.

As far as (hard-ish) scifi goes, it&#x27;s a big deal. In a way, what MT calls MUH Egan calls &quot;dust theory&quot; (roughly). It&#x27;s a very interesting exploration of the whole idea, and it involves cellular automata, etc etc.<p>There&#x27;s also a short story of his, &quot;Wang&#x27;s Carpets&quot; (which you can read online[2]) - it was later incorporated (as a chapter) into his book &quot;Diaspora&quot;[3] (which is <i>also</i> a great read that I&#x27;ve thoroughly enjoyed.)<p>> <i>Although, to be fair to Tegmark, he goes further than I ever did: &quot;The predictions of the theory take the form of probability distributions for the outcome of experiments, which makes it testable.&quot;</i><p>I wonder, though, if this is not a bit of a stretch. I certainly understand what he (and you) mean by probability distributions, but it seems to be there because he <i>really wants</i> to be able to call it a &quot;scientific theory,&quot; which requires it to be falsifiable (<=> testable.) But, yeah, it&#x27;s pretty neat!<p>> <i>I was thinking maybe the probability of finding yourself in a given universe is related to the length of the computer program that runs that universe.</i><p><i>Now</i>, can some of those programs run a (say, finite-tape-version-of) Turing machine[4] (can some of them not run it)? Does this have any implications (re: / in relation to the halting problem, for example)? I don&#x27;t have the faintest idea. Tegmark has a thing to say about mathematically incomplete (in the Godel sense) universes, but again, I&#x27;m not sure how much of it is just him having fun. ;) (which is the best way of having fun, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.)<p>...anyway.

These ideas are not new in themselves in the very least. e.g. I&#x27;m still yet to try and honestly delve into Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason,&quot; which actually addresses some of that stuff (in its own very particular vocabulary and context.)

Or, while we&#x27;re at it, <i>&#x27;list files&#x27;</i>, or <i>&#x27;list files in current directory&#x27;</i>. Maybe someone has and I just didn&#x27;t meet them yet.<p>I do see the point of a programming language to be a bit more verbose, since it makes sharing between humans easier, as understanding old codebases – but even there, people are split (Java is too verbose! Ruby is natural! Lisp is too much abbreviated! etc.). But <i>using</i> a shell, issuing <i>commands</i>, is fundamentally different to <i>programming</i>, in my opinion. Consider the analogy of a crane (just to avoid cars for once), what would you prefer: Waving your finger around in thin air, or using levers? And before you answer that: while the former seems way more cool, it doesn&#x27;t work well. Getting rid of mechanical controls has been tried experimentally by the Air force (I read that back in the 90&#x27;s; sorry no link to a source now): They were able to interpret commands from the pilots brainwaves, but manual control was <i>consistently</i> faster. We humans just evolved this way: <i>Thinking</i> of moving a plane into particular direction is slower than moving your hand accordingly to yank a stick – it seems to have a higher more mental load for us. Do you picture your arm moving your mouse? I bet you &quot;just do&quot;.<p>But I digress; though the fundamentals in play are the same. My fingers are fast; why should I slow down the whole thing by making them type more?<p>Of course, a shell using of single-letter commands would be equally useless to an overly verbose shell. The sweet spot, in the end, might be a personal preference and dependent of daily usage and experience.

784206,comment,783912,783978,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Occam's razor suggests that Wired's explanation is complete bullshit. Let me give a far simpler explanation that would explain all the phenomena mentioned in the article:<p>We are seeing a rise in physical health problems due to increasing social isolation and other mental health risk factors.<p>As we replace the community barbeques with family grills we're losing more than a fun weekend activity, we're losing something that's evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to keep us mentally healthy. And more and more, scientists are learning that mental health is one of the greatest predictors (if not the greatest) of physical well being.<p>Why do you think ~50% of college students experience clinical depression? I'm sure that stress, poor diet, lack of sleep, and excessive alcohol consumption are all contributing factors, but at the end of the day these poor lifestyle ""choices"" aren't really choices at all; rather, they're triggered by specific design decisions made at the institutional and societal level.<p>Placebos aren't working better because people have more faith in medicine, they're working better because of the Hawthorne effect; people feel like they have someone who cares about them. That's why the effectiveness is radically different across populations, depending on the social environment, even though we're all exposed to the same media.",1251176355

I'm not going to completely discount the study, but I would like to counter - with capitalism itself.<p>Capitalism enforces the reward concept so effectively, that every now and then we almost collectively implode exchanging rewards. The system works too well, if anything.<p>Aside from that, the only thing this shows is that people who enjoy the task in question will do a better job than those who do not. Well, duh. A talent is a combination of skill and enjoyment - of course they will outperform someone who is simply assigned a task.<p>That doesn't mean rewards don't encourage behaviour, it just means that you can't pay for passion.",1251176225

Nobody with any experience handling a mouse is thinking about the mouse itself, but only about the effect it will produce on the screen.<p>The ""move towards"" / ""move away"" analogy falls apart because the screen is a vertical plane. ""Up"" is more intuitive than ""away"", and ""down"" is more intuitive than ""towards"". You may even see an example of this intuition in how people talk about using the scroll wheel: nobody says ""scroll towards"" or ""scroll away"".

784193,comment,779531,783308,0,0,shiranaihito,,,"Well, my understanding of all this is that:<p>1) You were actually eavesdropping on e-mail conversations.
2) The people being eavesdropped on used their company-provided e-mail accounts.
3) You found out lots of really personal stuff about the people.
4) Your ""defense"" here is that they shouldn't have been talking about personal stuff on their company-provided e-mail accounts.<p>Correct?<p>Now, assuming that I've got it right, let's go through these again:<p>1) This is bad, mmkay?
2) This is likely to happen at, you know, workplaces.
3) Again, people's personal matters are <i>personal</i>.
4) This is a bit more complicated:<p>I'm sure you agree that by default, whenever you send an e-mail, you don't expect it to be read by anyone else besides the intended recipient(s). That's just the way people perceive e-mail - that they're sending ""letters"" to others.<p>But basically now you're saying that because these people were sending e-mails from a company account, they should expect them to be read by people other than the recipients, and therefore should avoid talking about anything personal?<p>It's true that some shitty companies do read their employees' e-mails, so this argument has some merit, but not all of them do. I wouldn't want to work at a company that I'd expect to be reading my e-mail all the time.<p>At the workplace in question, do you think people had any reason to suspect their mails were being read by others? Were they the kind of people who would even be aware of the possibility?<p>You said you were just trying to find out how fucked the company was, but did you really think there was <i>nothing wrong</i> with your approach?<p><i>Besides, knowing someone screwed on the conference table after work hours is useful knowledge when you sometimes eat lunch in the conference room.</i><p>Cute, but I'm sure the table is cleaned daily.",1251175801

I don't know her personally, but she seems constructive and smart and funny.<p>As for monetizing it, since their system will/does support renting/loaning between people, I imagine they can take a cut of that? Maybe membership? (Now i'm just guessing)<p>I in no way mentioned Neighborgoods as a reason you should stop working on your project, but rather something to <i>validate</i> it! (Yep, I'm one of those polyanna's... :D)<p>I really do think you should open source it though, or at least big chunks of it, even if you do a hosted service. (I can save the reasons for this for another time.)<p>As for eBay rep, I don't think it should replace an internal reputation system, but especially in the early goings, what could it hurt? And not just eBay, selective data from as many 3rd party places as possible. Even a Twitter account that's more than 6 months old could make some people (like me) more comfortable loaning certain kinds of things.<p>And man... I think there's so much wasted cycles on sites like Freecycle and Craigslist free section... basically there is no item ""management."" Even when stuff is free, so many inquiries on stuff that's gone, or redundant follow-up letters to tell people it's taken, etc.  I know your system is a different use-case than give-aways, but I see an overlap in need and purpose, and stuff + relationship management is applicable to multiple situations (and similar demographics of people who like to be resourceful).<p>As for beta of NeighborGoods, I have an invite for you.

Until that point, armies were largely expected to be self-funding, so they would take resources from local towns (and destroy those of their opposition). Due to the utter exhaustion on all sides at the end of the war, and the cost of supporting large standing armies, a number of military reforms came about, including making armies smaller and more professional, and making non-combatant populations (more or less) off-limits. This is largely were we get the concept of a ""civilian"" -- someone who has allegiance to a nation but is not directly involved in the fighting of its wars.",1251173352

I found that even with those opportunities, they continued to treat others with a lack of respect.  The kind of lack of respect that makes people not want to help them or even be around them.<p>I even rent-to-owned a house to a family with 5 kids. This family would never have had the opportunity to own a house had I not given them that opportunity.  They didn't have a high school diploma, no credit.  Judgements against them. Criminal history.  So I thought, ""If they have the opportunity, will they take it to improve their life?  If they have the opportunity to buy and own a home, will they make the most of it?""<p>They <i>destroyed</i> the house. They caused more damage than they paid in rent.<p>It isn't the lack of opportunity.  I thought it was, but it isn't.  Opportunities are external motivators.  It takes internal motivation to succeed.  You can't <i>provide</i> that to someone.  They have to create it within themselves.  It's the people who have that internal motivation who <i>find</i> opportunities and make the most of them.",1251173178

You need to heat up water in your microwave and then let it sit for a few minutes.  If you really are worried about time, pre-grind a bunch of beans over the weekend.  You'll sacrifice a bit in taste, but it will make preparation faster.  With an automatic coffee pot, just set it up the night before on a timer, and you'll have steaming hot coffee ready when your alarm goes off.  We're really only talking about a difference of a few minutes.  It will take you longer than that to get rid of the extra calories.",1251172967

It wouldn't have to be complete sterility, just just enough to bring the rate of successful procreation down to a 2.0 on average. The <i>hard</i> part (that is, the part that I can't think of an ethical means of studying) would be making sure that the infertility/impotence occurs only at the point of conception, and doesn't affect growing foetuses or developing children or hormone production in adults.<p>EDIT: To those that downvoted me, can you clarify what's wrong with the suggestion? When changing the social structure is impossible (without destroying the culture that informs it), you have to resort to a technical solution, no matter how distasteful it may be to imagine. The cultures affected most by overpopulation won't <i>use</i> condoms and birth control, won't <i>listen</i> to those that proselytize them, and won't let those that <i>would</i> listen anywhere near the educators. Just making a trade agreement such as ""you may only have two children if you take this aid crop"" won't work, because once they <i>have</i> the food, they'll go ahead and have the kids anyway (or more likely, just won't know <i>how</i> to <i>not</i> have the kids, whether you require it or not.) An agreement of ""you must allow sexual health educators to talk to your people in exchange for the aid"" might be closer, but again, nothing's making them take the advice to heart. What's so important about fertility that makes it override concerns about people's actual happiness over their lifetime? We're not talking about killing living people (or even living <i>cells</i>), we're talking about making sperm not attach to eggs.<p>And I apologize that this has turned into a definitively-non-HN comment; it was originally—humans can be ""hacked"" just as well as anything else, you know—but it seems people use the arrows to express their <i>ethical</i> opinion, which is something I've never seen before, so I decided to defend my own ethical stance, rather than just being objective and technical like most positively-seen discussions here are.",1251172886

His first thought was ""that's a good idea, but we'd have to make sure it would be easy to move that code to a different CMS in the future.""  There's just no way to make that happen, so the idea probably won't get off the ground because management wants things future-proof.<p>I see where they are coming from, but it means everybody suffers instead of just enjoying improvements in the present.",1204925913

But every time I think about it, I end up being inhibited by the question 'What if I want to make money off of this?' or I think 'By releasing this, I'll be wasting my competitive advantage.'  Then I get all conflicted thinking big general thoughts about capitalism vs. er... anti-capitalism (socialism? idealism? whatever you call it).<p>I'm currently 23 and being supported by my parents, which is nice because it offers me freedom, but lame for obvious reasons.  What I really want is the freedom to work on my ideas and the power to make them real.  I don't care much about money and am not very interested in going the VC -> IPO route, but I also realize that turning big ideas into reality may take a lot of money.  So part of this is me figuring out what trajectory to set my life on.  I guess I'll probably end up doing some combination of open / closed stuff, but I'm having trouble deciding where to draw the line.<p>I guess this is just the classic tension between open source vs. closed source playing out in my head.  Stallman vs. Gates.  I'm curious to see what YCers think of the issue.",1204925855

Because I get bored on either of them fairly quickly :-)<p>I love both of them, but my vote goes towards Ubuntu/Linux (and I mainly code on ThinkPad) for three reasons:<p>1. Most hackers' software is native on Linux, although nearly all of it exists for OS X. But nothing beats Debian/Ubuntu's aptitude: nearly everything imaginable is a few keystrokes away: can installed and pre-configured in seconds. And guaranteed to ""just work"".<p>2. Apple's hardware is no match to IBM's. UltraNav combo kicks ass, and I feel crippled and slowed down when using a touchpad of other laptops, including Apple's.<p>3. Linux is more flexible. It's not the ""sysadmin carp"" that some people from the 90s complain about, it's genuine flexibility that comes with choice. There are many more different terminal apps, different ways to manage workspaces, various window management plug-ins, screensavers even! OS X is more commercialized.<p>Besides, I dislike some of Apple's software. iTunes is number one on my hate-list. :-)",1204925274

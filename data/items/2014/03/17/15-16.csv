The employee has a right to privacy in the hospital and not having his coworkers &quot;checking up&quot; on him. If he was collecting disability, he should have his doctor communicate with HR/someone who handles the claims and HR needs to keep their mouth shut to others. I spent an extended time sick and a bunch of that time was in and out of the hospital and I would have been awfully pissed, really really pissed, if my boss or coworkers showed up to &quot;check in on me.&quot; That was my private time to suffer in peace, I was disheveled, suffering, and in pain and the last person I wanted to see was my boss/coworker. I was collecting disability through my employer and my doctors filled out the appropriate forms and faxed them in to the HR person who handled medical claims. I informed my boss when I would be coming back to work when I knew and was cleared by my doctor. My doctor had to sign another form permitting me to return to work, so I called my boss once that form was faxed into HR. If they needed to know if/about when he was coming back, they could have called and asked if there was a time the employee would be back to work without asking details of his illness or progression. Sending someone to &quot;check up&quot; on him was terribly inappropriate and was possibly a violation of the law.<p>Furthermore, the author also doesn&#x27;t have any idea what caused the illness, don&#x27;t assume it was caused by working too hard. There could have been no cause at all, or the employee could have had a history of acute psychotic episodes for all the author knows.",1395071583

After that, you precalculate the intercept to a plane that works timing-wise before you take off.  Non-trivial, but simple enough to do - on ground ahead of time you can get a computer to do all the work.<p>Once you go dark, you fly the traditional way with GPS and nav aides (GPS, VORs, etc, are broadcast, so you can use them passively) backed up by manual nav with time, speed, and bearings.  Note that handheld (throw it on the dash) pilot grade GPSes are readily available and relatively cheap.<p>Intercepting the target aircraft is do-able via visual contact if your navigation is reasonably good and the target aircraft is on time.<p>If you have help on the ground, they could use FlightAware to update the hijacking crew via something like HF radio, again a passive receive on the hijacked aircraft. This would be very helpful for the hijacking crew to improve their intercept by adjusting their speed so that they sneak up under and behind the target aircraft.<p>Edit: As thekevan points out (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7416153"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7416153</a>), the hijackers could use a ADS/B receiver (SDR and laptop or equivalent) to receive the position data from the target aircraft.

In addition, there is abundant psychometric evidence that individuals with higher IQs have larger vocabularies [26], [27]. Prior to taking the vocabulary test, the respondent is told the following by the interviewer [24]: “We would like to know something about how people go about guessing words they do not know. On this card are listed some words–you may know some of them, and you may not know quite a few of them. On each line the first word is in capital letters–like BEAST. Then there are five other words. Tell me the number of the word that comes closest to the meaning of the word in capital letters. For example, if the word in capital letters is BEAST, you would say “4” since “animal” come closer to BEAST than any of the other words. If you wish, I will read the words to you. These words are difficult for almost everyone–just give me your best guess if you are not sure of the answer.” The respondent is assigned a score between 0 and 10, corresponding to the number of words she defined correctly.<p>&quot;Our second measure of intelligence is an assessment by the interviewer of how well the respondent understood the survey questions. The interviewer notes down whether the respondent’s understanding of the survey questions was “good”, “fair” or “poor” [24]. We refer to our first measure as ‘verbal ability’ and our second measure as ‘question comprehension’. The Pearson correlation between these two variables is 0.37 (p<0.001), meaning that they are moderately positively correlated. The strength of their correlation is depicted in Table 1, a simple cross-tabulation. It indicates that 98% of those scoring 10 out of 10 in the vocabulary test have a good understanding of the survey questions, yet only 36% of those scoring 0 out of 10 have a good understanding of them.&quot;",1395071400

The one key area of overlap is in the image portrayed by Prius and Model S ownership.<p>The study is pretty old (2004, I think), but J.D. Power found that the average income of a hybrid buyer was $100k/year versus $85k/year for the general market. They also found that 42% of hybrid owners make more than $100k per year. This means that a lot of Prius buyers have the means to own a Model S.<p>The context in which a Tesla Model S gets cross-shopped against a Prius is in that both cars showcase the owners commitment to being &quot;green&quot;.

But if they were to run these two festivals in consecutive weeks perhaps the economies of that would make it more viable.<p>Fortunately Glastonbury has managed to stay resolutely non-corporate, unlike most of the larger UK music festivals (V, Reading, Leeds etc.) and still manage to host a shedload of really good bands across the fame/size spectrum.<p>But maybe, in a similar fasion, if SXSW were to split and leave the corporate shilling to the mainstream crowd/event, maybe the other half of the festival could return to more how it was, discovering new music with people who care about new music and not having to queue for ages for the privilege?",1395071193

7415680,comment,7413622,7414744,2,0,leoc,,,"> Paying off a pilot who is skilled enough to fly the aircraft evading all radar and land it unassisted at night or early dawn on some remote airbase would be a major expense. Paying someone to kill off the rest of the 220 passengers would be a big challenge as well. And everybody involved would know that and the additional risk and thus demand much more money. You would have to find such an airbase. And you would have people at the airbase to take care of everything, including hiding the jet from satellites. And the airbase would have to be unused and remote.<p>If you wanted to use one of the actual Malaysian Airlines pilots to divert the plane, I expect you might have great difficulty being confident about approaching the right guy (if any) without first being turned down and reported. Likely nothing else in the above is unduly difficult for a number of state actors. The rest of the passengers might not be killed either.<p>> Ditching the aircraft safely into calm waters is even more unrealistic. First of all AFAIK it has never been successfully done with a wide-body aircraft and even in a small-body aircraft it would be a major risk. It would require perfect weather and calm ocean. And it would have happened at night!<p>Perhaps, though if the plane went south to the Indian Ocean SATCOM arc it would apparently have been daylight when it was last pinged. (Source: <a href=""http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/6027829/#13"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/re...</a> ) The primary radar reports seem to suggest otherwise though.<p>> There are a ton of risks involved in all of this. How could they hijackers have known that the Malaysian air force wasn&#x27;t properly looking at its radar? They could have scrambled jets at that point and all of this complicated plan would have been for nothing. What if the flight they allegedly used for the radar shadow would have been delayed or they would have been delayed? What if there had been a military ship with their own radar on an exercise or patrol? After all they flew over one of the busiest water lanes in the world with an active piracy problem. What if ...<p>Flight 370 in all probability <i>was</i> pinged several times by primary radar without any decisive response. Someone whose job was to be well-informed about these things a) might well choose to take the calculated risk that Malaysia would do nothing effective and b) would likely have been right.<p>> You are looking at it after the fact and not from the perspective of someone who had to come up with the plan and evaluate all the risks.<p>> I&#x27;m not saying that kidnapping or killing a handful of people on the ground would be easy. But compared to such an unprecedented and skilled aircraft hijacking plan it seems like a piece of cake.<p>On the contrary, I think that any such alternative plan to kidnap and interrogate a handful of the Freescale guys would probably seem at least as risky if you described it in some detail, then looked at it with as much scepticism as you&#x27;ve directed at the flight-370 version.<p>I think the real primary reason to discount it at the moment is indeed the attention: the political blowback for being caught would be too painful, even if you&#x27;d had the minimal good sense not to deliberately kill the Chinese or US citizens on board. It would be a huge <i>causus belli</i>, more or less a second 9/11. Any attempt to misdirect the blame would likely not hold up long. (And a few secondary ones: China is the #1 usual suspect for military-industrial espionage on the US at present, and there are several additional reasons it wouldn&#x27;t want to, or have to, pull something like this. A state hijacker would presumably be well informed enough not to be caught out by the disabling-ACARS-doesn&#x27;t-shut-down-SATCOM gotcha. And probably if you pull a random airliner off its course in SE Asia you&#x27;re quite likely to catch a significant number of interesting-looking people like the Freescale group.)",1395070587

You haven&#x27;t for example mentioned how much experience you have with the language, how much programming experience you have in general and other useful things such as what you are using Java for.<p>Now for recommendations there are a lot of directions that you can go:<p>* for one the language has a lot of features that all the fancy frameworks use, you should know these so you don&#x27;t end up using some blown up solution when all you needed was a simple servlet. This would include things like: collections, generics, annotations, enums, concurrency, IO & NIO, JAXP, sockets, servlets, JSP.<p>This part is pretty heavily covered in Bruce Eckel&#x27;s &quot;Thinking in Java&quot;. Not the easiest read, but definitely a very complete language reference. Servlets & JSP are pretty well covered in &quot;Head First Servlets & JSP&quot;.<p>* another point to consider are general practices that transcend language such as coding practices, design patterns and testing.<p>You already mentioned &quot;Effective Java&quot;, which would be the first one I would recommend in this category.<p>A very good book about coding practices based in the Java world would be &quot;Clean Code&quot; by Robert Martin. &quot;Head First Design patterns&quot; are very easy to digest, while the &quot;Design pattern&quot; book by the GoF is heavier reading. For testing I would definitely recommend you have a look at &quot;Growing object oriented software guided by tests&quot;.<p>* depending on your field of work you might or might not be interested in Java memory stuff. This includes things like how and where objects are kept in memory, gc algorithms etc.<p>Have a look at this presentation from JVM tuning at Twitter and see if this is your thing:\n<a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/JVM-Performance-Tuning-twitter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/JVM-Performance-Tuning-tw...</a><p>* finally, and in my opinion the lowest return of investment you could get, is by going for some framework. Not that this is bad, but generally frameworks tend to have shorter lifespans than the language itself and they usually change between projects so all your new Spring chops might not help you on your following project that uses EJB.<p>I&#x27;m not going to recommend anything here, since this is a very fuzzy topic and it depends on the problems you are tackling.<p>Let me know if you need other ideas.",1395070461

I have PTSD from my combat time in the Corps, and when I got out I determined to never work so hard for so little ever again. I have since been a part of 3 startups (current employer included), and I continually see the issue where C levels like to do C level things and offer little to no incentive for actual productive employee&#x27;s to continue to be so. I think there is a miscommunication in the American social business contract that is more exaggerated these days and that is where these problems start.<p>It goes like this:<p>C-Guy: I work 80 hours a week, and have for X years.. (implying worker A should too)<p>Worker A: I get paid salary, and no matter how hard I work I don&#x27;t get anything other than state-mandated overtime pay.<p>C-Guy: Well if you worked harder and produced more value to company you might get a bonus or incentive Y.<p>(This is where the misunderstanding comes into play)<p>Worker A: I&#x27;m not going to kill myself on verbal half-assed promises of maybe bonuses. Honestly I&#x27;m getting underpaid as it is (startup culture ftl) and my time is worth more than you are paying me.<p>The problem is the idea of vague half promised incentives that aren&#x27;t on paper and aren&#x27;t easily legally enforceable. Hence, and entire section of the work force who might be able to do great things doesn&#x27;t.<p>I forgot the other jab the C-level gives:<p>C-Level: We are working to benefit humanity and doing great work!

In addition, data monitoring systems could be programmed with the intelligence to transmit more detailed telemetry in the event of an anomaly (e.g., the &quot;left turn&quot; with regard to MH370). This would be an attempt to find the right balance of data fidelity, with regard to available transmission capabilities and associated costs.<p>Sadly, as it is now, we are left with relying on essentially locating the proverbial &quot;needle in a haystack&quot; with regard to locating the FDR. Another example is the case with AF447 [1]. Although the FDR was recovered, it was not until nearly 2 years after the incident.<p>My heart goes out to those that lost loved ones.

Think about all the movies you&#x27;ve seen since the 1980s, the shows you&#x27;ve watched, the books you&#x27;ve read. Embedded in the majority of them is the simple idea that there&#x27;s something special inside you that can set you apart from everyone else. It whispers seductively to that part of your brain that lies to you about how important you are. Any story or idea that fills the need to feel different, special, and unique passes through our scrutiny without a second thought. We want to believe it&#x27;s true even as we examine our motivations for doing so because it&#x27;s hard wired into our brains.<p>The problem is that this weakness is easily exploited. Writers, motivational speakers, game designers, poets... they&#x27;re all in the business of hacking our brains. We&#x27;ve been doing such a good job of it since the sixties that our popular culture is unconsciously driven by it.<p>And it manifests as burnout when it clashes with other popular memes like the Protestant Work Ethic. If you just put in a little elbow grease and work harder you will stand out. If you write that amazing library to make programmers&#x27; lives easier they will shower you with praise on the Internet and invite you to speak at conferences so that you may shower the masses with your brilliant message. Burnout happens when all of the rewards of those fantasies fail to materialize despite all of the effort and hard work you&#x27;ve put into chasing them.<p>Worked 60 - 80 hour weeks for the last six months and still got overlooked for that promotion? Burnout.<p>Put off investing time with your family in order to work on that semi-popular open source library and pimp it out at every conference you can submit a proposal to... and you STILL aren&#x27;t getting the accolades and recognition you deserve? Burnout.<p>My advice for avoiding burnout? Figure out where your desires and ambitions are coming from. Why do you want to work so hard for recognition? Why do you feel you need to be recognized?

Where you can walk to your roof, get in your personal space ship and go pickup your buddy on Sirius 3 to go that hot new restaurant on Mars.<p>And it could probably be done, just 100 years ago cars were a thing for the richest of the rich.

Most products aren't like that. It is relatively hard to know the quality of an Accounting package before you buy it and use it extensively, for example. In that sort of context, price does often send a signal about what market niche you are aiming for.",1220878478

298243,comment,297909,298006,0,0,cturner,,,"It's tempting to flag this - politics not hacking. However, North Korea is interesting in a special way - because it's so extreme. It's like one of those exercises where you run some code the way it's not meant to be run with the idea of ""I wonder how far we can push this"". Starving people, no foreign relations, extreme corruption, yet still it chugs along as it has for two decades. The horror is resiliant.<p>> Supposedly, schoolchildren there are taught that both\n> Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il are superhuman beings that\n> do not exercise the same bodily functions that\n> conventional humans do.<p>I think it's a lot more practical than this. North Korea is like one of those systems where you've deleted all the source code but the process is still running. So long as you don't stop the process, and can keep the power running, it just ticks along. Of course, you can't make change beyond that provisioned for before the problem developed. So.. you just run with it because you don't have any other options.<p>The interesting thing is - if it collapses the results could be profound for all of us. The south feels a strong companionship to the people in the north even though, for practical purposes they now have very little in common. The south is prosperous.and educated and liberal. Currently the humanitarian crisis is hidden behind the parallel, but as soon as the state flounders in the north then countries around the world (locals like the south, China and possibly Russia) will feel obliged to help, and the west will probably play a role too due to their close historical relationship to South Korea.<p>North Korea is a two-state society - the ruling group, and the rest. The ruling group will do whatever they can to stay in power. In the west, I wouldn't believe that a lie like this could be sustained. I've met people from former eastern-european countries who really do know how to keep a secret, and to separate their clan lives from their public face. Even if he's still alive then it's an amazing situation for the resolve he has shown to avoid the mistake (on a selfish level) of attempting gradual reform in a system that is beyond it.",1220878209

After a long absence, I will emerge from my hideaway armed with a thorough understanding of Common Lisp. I will write a single macro, more profound than the deepest koan, more concise than the <i>Reader's Digest Condensed Edition</i> of a haiku. When executed, this macro will generate the source code to a second program -- a program so powerful it will be a Google killer that evolves into a Google killer-killer, all while running on a single 386, even if it isn't plugged in. My Series A will empty Fort Knox, exhaust the New York Fed, and leave me with the Crown Jewels of a thousand forgotten dynasties.<p>I will sell some of these on ebay, and donate the profits to charity.

I had actually misspoke; I meant we had replaced a (relatively) large amount of Republicans with Democrats, <i>as well as</i> gained a majority in both houses.  However, yes, even with majorities we can't ever get anything done because of the way the senate and vetoes were designed, regardless if you think the design is good or bad.

You don't know how exactly, but you have a starting point: inject some sort of protective something that will do it.<p>Why do you think I would laugh at them? It seems quite plausible to me.<p>You are totally wrong about people in 1920. People 2000 years ago even were eating various plants for their medicinal effect. Some of the books from that time (or a little later) still exist! And some of them even work (willow bark for pain for example).<p>That does not exist with AI. Give me any idea at all of a programming method (besides random permutation) that will, eventually, even with a lot of work, result in AI.<p>You don't realize just how much harder creating creativity is from anything else humanity has ever done. Create a mechanism that will create something new that has never existed before? (And is not simply a reshuffling of other things.) Computers can not do that, and I don't think will ever be able to do that. (Again, except by trying everything randomly.) Even humans rarely do that - and the ones that do have no idea how they do it, so what makes you think we can program such a thing?<p>Read some quotes from Mark Kac about magician genius and you'll start to understand the problem. No one has any idea how they make their leaps. A regular genius simply can not do what they do. So why do you think we can program a computer to do such a thing, when we can not even understand how it's done in the first place?<p>AI is not coming. And on top of all that computing speed has hit a wall. The entire premise depends on computers getting faster and faster. They aren't right now. Intel can not make CPU's run any faster than they are right now. Instead they are adding cores.<p>Now I expect that to be solved at some point, but it means the exponential growth curve broke. And that means no more singularity.<p>That's something I don't see much talk of. But it's over, there is no more exponential growth in computing speed.",1220875665

He treats it like a new html rendering engine, which is just wrong.<p>He doesn't even mention the gauntlet that it throws down with Javascript performance, and the challenge that this brings to Microsoft's silverlight (for instance). The new javascript engine is where the web dev testing may be needed.<p>But his main and lengthiest mistake is with regards the EULA, which he seems to take as evidence of google being evil. Did he honestly think that google would try to cliam ownership of blog posts (or books) written via google chrome? Like that was going to ever fly, with users, courts, or sane Google executives.<p>It looks very much as if Google was not ""trying to pull a stunt"" with the EULA.<p>Google made a cut-and-paste error. It was a bug. Google chrome is a beta. B-E-T-A. It has bugs, and they get spotted.

The problem is, though, that in traditional law firms many things that <i>can</i> be done by computers are done by humans. This has a couple of effects:<p>1. Soul-sucking work. Want to know why so many lawyers hate what they do? Because they are doing stuff that computers can do better and faster. It kills initiative, creativity, and any sense of joy.<p>2. Higher bills for clients. This is all done by the billable hour, so having humans do lots of soul-sucking work <i>is extremely lucrative.</i> We recently had a massive all-hands-on doc review that needed to be done over the course of about three days.

Dynamic languages on .NET got the benefit of neither of these, so it should not be surprising that they are slower than their native implementations (which also get better funding/bigger communities).

Yes, there are exceptions - but from a practical standpoint, the working of the black box is irrelevant for most projects and it appears that Microsoft recognized this when Longhorn was shelved.<p>The speculation that the javascript/HTML5 model indicates a fundamental architectural shift in the Windows OS core seems to be unjustifed - the meaningful evidence for such an architectural shift being underway is the demonstrated ability of Windows 8 to run on diverse architectures.<p>Which is why the FUD being disseminated about the Javascript HTML model is so interesting.

These are not standard algorithms, and the likelihood of a closed implementation of a chess engine exactly matching the logic of an open sourced version on a number of unusual algorithms cannot be down to pure coincidence.<p>I guess the developer behind Rybka studied the code behind both Crafty and Fruit, and elected to use pieces of code from them, but didn't acknowledge/give credit for those pieces of code.<p>One of the example pieces of code is a hack to avoid enpassant specifically in a King and pawn versus a King and pawn endgame - something rather unusual considering the same issue occurs if either/both sides have more than 1 pawn. Fruit's approach was just to treat the KPvKP, and so to did Rybkas.<p>Again, the algorithms documeted were based around unique approaches to evaluating various facets of evaluating the score of a position, not something as simple as ""can the White king castle in this position"". So they don't make a massive difference in playing strength, which suggests more strongly that there's been some uncredited copying going on.<p>Rybka has been the strongest rated chess engine for a few years now. Granted that the developer has found definite improvements over the other chess engines out there. But, for the purposes of World Computer Chess Champion, the developer must own the program he runs (or document/credit the sections of the code he doesn't own)<p>Definitely have a look through the evidence.

My thought is based on some assumptions of course, so feel free to launch an attack starting there.<p>1 - Javascript is not fundamentally easier to code in than Java. I wouldn't make that statement with Ruby for example, but I've done lots of all 3.<p>2 - when writing servers, you actually care about performance.  Nodejs is fine, but there are (including Java) solutions that hands down beat it by several factors. And that's on a single or (shudder) multiple cores.<p>The coding paradigm of node.js is not novel, it lives in Netty (among other places).  The reports of having 100k connections is great but again, any server in C or Java written correctly should be able to do the same thing (asynchronous I/O with proper VM/kernel tuning).<p>I am a big fan of trading performance for programming productivity when appropriate. That's the entire point of things like Rails. But developers enter those at the application layer with strong intent of scaling to handle load ""if they get popular"" with the trade-off of faster development.<p>But if you are writing at the node.js layer, you're writing a server. The V8 js engine changed everything and even made this possible, but dynamic languages are at an inherent disadvantage to statically-typed languages in terms of performance (node.js vs other solutions, and JS vs. Java benchmarks are easy to find)<p>Choosing node.js over netty (again, for example) simply seems like a choice of ""cool factor"" over performance. Unlike comparing Rails vs. Java for a web app (where I, if able, would choose the former) the coding productivity claims are dubious.",1309357130

Socket.io (WebSocket sever with multiple transports to fallback to) is an example of why this is useful.<p>The lack of interprocess communication that would help parallelize tasks between cores is the one thing that's lacking.

Yeah, you won&#x27;t get sent to jail for it, but if you don&#x27;t make it <i>legal</i>, you are still dealing in a black market commodity. That means that you&#x27;ll still have criminals with no access to the legal system supplying the stuff, so you won&#x27;t see the same reduction in drug-related violence and you won&#x27;t see quality control.<p>With heroin at least, the &quot;bad batches&quot; that kill people (and have killed a number of my family members and people in my extended social circle) tend to be the ones that are purer - people know that they usually need 1 bag to get high, then suddenly there&#x27;s twice as much heroin in a given bag because the batch is purer than they expected and it causes a bunch of people to OD. This problem would be solved if it were legal and you could buy it in a store from a person who you could <i>sue</i> if they caused your wrongful death, but decriminalizing heroin wouldn&#x27;t do anything for that.<p>Furthermore, this doesn&#x27;t reduce the incentive that Mexican drug gangs have for killing <i>thousands</i> of people to secure their territory along the border, because you&#x27;d still need to produce the drugs somewhere and smuggle them into rich countries like the US.<p>Certainly it&#x27;d be nice if in addition to all these other horrible problems we also didn&#x27;t spend a ton of money throwing people in jail for using drugs, but honestly I don&#x27;t see decriminalization as anything more than a stepping stone on the way to full legalization of all drugs.",1405785405

This is easier to understand, if you study go circuit.org because it is a concrete product not just a semantic. There:<p>A program starts and sees nothingness. Then a host emerges out of nowhere. (A human provisioning engineer must have turned it on in the data center.) Then the program can do something with it (like start a database) or it can wait (indefinitely) for another emergence of a host (before it sets up an elastic DB, say). The point is that objects emerge in your &quot;sight&quot; and they are nameless. The namelessness is the choicelessness. And this might seem like a small difference, but it is huge.<p>Chomsky tells Linguists: Try to imagine the world from the new-born baby&#x27;s point of view; and trust me that the baby is\nborn knowing nothing. The only difference is that the baby sees a &quot;blooming buzzing confusion&quot; (i.e. many hosts are online already). But the connection is that everything is nameless (at first). The baby sees many visual pixels. They have no meaning (i.e. no linguistic names). Later the baby sorts out the confusion and assigns names to all phenomena in its sight. Same for circuit programs. They see a nameless army of live hosts. They are all equally good, hence nameless. Then the program start purposing them differently (some are dbs, some are https, etc.). This is the same as the baby assigning names to pixels in its sight until it wakes up one day at age 5, thinking it understands the world. Ha :)",1405783772

8057662,comment,8057401,8057401,4,0,chimeracoder,,,"My favorite part, right at the end:<p>> After each crash, disaster or terrorist episode, it is natural to point fingers and say, Why didn’t we foresee that specific threat? Thus one attempted shoe bombing leads to a decade of shoes-off orders in security lines. The truth is that air transportation, like most other modern systems, could not operate if it fortified itself against every conceivable peril.<p>Many people like to use phrases like &quot;one $INCIDENT is one too many&quot;. In reality, all of life is about balancing and mitigating risks. Just because a single failure happened in one case doesn&#x27;t mean the entire system is faulty; given enough time, any system that is not 100% foolproof (that is, all of them) is going to have a failure. The question is whether it is actually feasible and/or reasonable to prevent those.",1405782490
8057661,comment,8057401,8057634,5,0,danso,,,"HN is just about software &quot;bugs&quot; now?<p>This is a systems bug based on an underestimation of a technical bug, i.e. that flying 1,000 feet over a 32,000 feet restricted altitude was considered &quot;safe&quot; given the hardware used. Such an assumption ended up being wrong. OTOH, the OP makes the point that diverting flights isn&#x27;t as simply as moving the joystick in a different direction, given the nature of crowded airspace and routes. It&#x27;s also interesting to note, as the OP does, that flights at lower altitudes were routinely conducted over Afghanistan and Iraq.<p>I actually think the OP is overstating his case though...but I posted it here because I know there are flight enthusiasts who care about the details, such as whether 1,000 ft. above a restricted altitude is not much more reckless than speeding 63 mph over 65.<p>HN will be a sad place if it concerns itself only with bugs in pure logic, and not all the bugs and misunderstandings of details and mechanics that exist outside of software code.",1405782473

5930555,comment,5929789,5930386,3,0,mpyne,,,"There is actually already a lot of law and regulation that deals with what types of functions contractors working for government are allowed to do.<p>IMHO the government far overstepped those lines during Bush and have failed to come back under Obama, as that would mean taking on civil servant headcount to replace the contractors leaving, which is politically a hot potato.<p>Unfortunately the people only rarely expect and demand <i>less</i> service from the government; instead they want the government to stop all the stuff that they don&#x27;t personally use. So of course this means that the government rarely stops with a given function entirely.<p>The military ended up with the same problem. The draft would not be politically feasible and you only get to go to war with &quot;the Army you&#x27;ve got, not the Army you&#x27;d wished you had&quot;. What the Army did have was money, and so they farmed out everything they could make even a half-hearted case as being a &quot;generic business function&quot; (e.g. building security) off on private contractors.<p>And that&#x27;s even with the Navy drawing down on its already-undermanned force to send sailors to Iraq and Afghanistan to free up even more soldiers to do Army-type things.",1372039177

This brings a part of my life back to mind that I hoped to forget...  FS, if you&#x27;re reading and recognize this, I still respect the hell out of you and wish you well. I can&#x27;t go into too much depth here without revealing more than allowed.  I am purposely vague and I apologize if that bothers or offends you but I don&#x27;t want to see any litigation in my future.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to take this article.  I wish some of the insight had been around when it mattered to me (working 60 - 80 hour weeks because of management over-promising because they wouldn&#x27;t take the time to understand the scope because the PM was sure it was &quot;trivial&quot;) but some of it also smacks of the PM thinking of her/himself as some kind of deity whose wishes would make the work happen magically.  Me, personally, I like my deities to be left in church where I can ignore them as I deem necessary...<p>Anyway, the best PM like being I ever had contact with was a QA department head who had been in the line of business his whole life and knew <i>exactly</i> what something needed to do to succeed in that business.  He had a second in command that was also a lifer.  Between those 2 guys, when they got interested in something, that something did some smooth sailing.  If they were disinterested or too busy with a fire, all hell would break loose.<p>Well, at this particular company, every time all hell would break loose, they would, instead of fixing the original software, buy something similar and try to massage it into the product.  During the ~19 months or so I was there, they bought, had been in talks to buy or were suing the seller over the bought product not working for <i>4</i> different products.  The funny thing was, all of these products were based on disparate technology...  The original software was built in a combination of Delphi, Borland C++ and the Borland DB engine.  Of the bought software, One was Java based, it wouldn&#x27;t run for 12 or more hours at a time.  One was based on .Net and it crashed more than it worked.  2 were based on popular C++ App Frameworks.  Those 2 kinda worked, sometimes, if you held your mouth right and kept your support contracts up to date.<p>Now, we have a company with at least 4 different technologies with maybe 2 of the original developers of any of the software left.  The only guy that remains with any sense and sanity is the QA guy because his family is tied to the company.  And all along he&#x27;s been yelling/screaming/cajoling/nurturing, whatever he can do to get the management to leave the programmers alone and so they can get the work done.",1372038575

I say if someone has done more than you, let them have their ego.)  Anyway, Wolfram&#x27;s emphasis on making the text accessible (through short sentences, etc) give it a meandering quality that makes it difficult to discern whatever implications he&#x27;s actually trying to go for.  There are so many examples that you forget what point he&#x27;s trying to make.<p>That said, I found some of the philosophy interesting.  I didn&#x27;t get all the way through the book, but the one that stuck out to me (which I also recognize is not something that Wolfram himself came up with) is the thing about how random outputs can come from systems with very simple inputs.<p>The implications there are interesting because it means that you can&#x27;t always reverse-engineer.  (&quot;Computational Irreducibility&quot;)  It also means that reductionism isn&#x27;t the end-all be-all of analysis, and that &quot;systems thinking&quot; and models-based analysis might be the only way to come to certain classes of insights.<p>It also means that the existence of highly complex systems is not evidence of a higher power, or a soul.  We cannot always reverse engineer the outputs of a highly complex systems down to a simple system with simple inputs, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that simple system doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>So it starts tying into the free will vs determinism philosophical argument - the point being that we as people <i>can</i> be non-deterministic complex systems, and that might feel like free will to us.  Which isn&#x27;t the same thing as saying that we are highly complex deterministic systems, with response patterns that would be completely predictable if we could analyze it enough.",1372037535

It&#x27;s one you bring up with your insurance company when they&#x27;re following up on the errors and omissions claim (E&O) you filed in order to cover the losses incurred by your own negligence.<p>Protip: When you&#x27;re in this situation DO NOT blame an intern. Interns - by definition - are unskilled, unpaid, and uninvested. If your insurance company finds out that interns are the only thing standing between them and damages for an IP lawsuit, they&#x27;ll strongly consider yanking your insurance altogether, at which point you&#x27;ve got a snowball&#x27;s chance in hell of finding a distributer.<p>That&#x27;s because copyright law allows rights-holders to sue not just the author of the illegally derivative work, but the author&#x27;s distributors. Since the distributors have no way to be absolutely certain that the authors they buy from have actually cleared every single underlying right, they insist that the authors carry insurance that will cover any losses suffered by the distributer in cases just like this. In any human enterprise, a certain number of errors will happen. That&#x27;s normal. But if a production company develops a history of recklessness, it may find itself uninsurable, and that&#x27;s the end of commercial viability.<p>Handling Rights & Clearances is work that is both skilled and tedious, meaning it should pay well.

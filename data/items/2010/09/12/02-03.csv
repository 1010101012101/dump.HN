I've been creating a ""social application framework"" called PHP On Pie over the past 2 years, mainly to streamline my own work with social media applications and also to re-use code and help my developers get up to speed quicker. I'm open sourcing it under the BSD license and hopefully others among you find it useful. If you do, feel free to contribute back to it.<p>I came up with its design after using a lot of other PHP frameworks, including Cake (RoR clone basically), symfony/agavi, CodeIgniter, Kohana and Zend. And drupal. I think PIE really tries to take advantage of the PHP way, and make things simple. If you want, you can drop classes from ZF or PEAR into it and they ""just work"". Anyway if anyone wants to get involved, drop me a line.<p>http://phponpie.com",1284260240

However here, since the user can refine results rapidly without their hands leaving the keyboard, I think you should only display 4, MAX 7 so they can scan all the results in a single isntant rather than performing multiple scans.<p>Maybe have JavaScript to cycle next 5 images binded to arrow key without leaving keyboard.<p>The human mind really only has visual memory for 5-7 objects at once, you should design it with this in mind if you want it to be <i>truely</i> instant.<p>edit: another idea easier to implement.

Whether the whole entertainment or ""lifestyle"" sections are superfluous or not doesn't event matter, as this really doesn't increase maintenance costs or makes the car itself that more complex. That's pretty orthogonal to the basic design. You could revamp a Model T with DVD players if you'd want to. I'm not saying that we need all that all that added stuff (AC, sound etc), but that even the essential components nowadays require a high level of complexity.<p>To get a reasonable amount of safety, you have to be either very cleve or apply huge amounts of brute force, i.e. build a friggin tank. Which probably still won't be as safe as other vehicles, neither for the car itself nor the one it hits. And the fuel economy will be utterly atrocious, especially if you want to keep the engine simple and user-maintainable.<p>I'd like to be proven wrong, but I think that it's simplicity, safety, performance – pick two. Maybe not even that, depending on current laws, standards and morals. I doubt that even something like the VW Beetle or the Citroen 2CV would be feasible today. You'd either end up with a gas-guzzling tank or a not-quite-car like the Vespa Ape, if simplicity is a constraint.<p>Again, I'd like to be proven wrong.

One endorsed by a department and whose name everyone understands. Do not invent the name of your major. A major is a brand. (Believe me: It need not have anything to do with your future career, let alone what you actually do in your own time.)<p>When I say that I have a degree in ""Physics"" people know for a fact that I have formal training in quantum mechanics and electrodynamics, that I have enough math background to navigate Maxwell's equations, and that I've probably seen an oscilloscope before. If my degree were in ""Computational Physical Sciences"" they would harbor doubts. They would be justifiably suspicious that I was bullshitting them, that I had dodged around grabbing easy electives and had never done any heavy lifting.<p>You only have to spend so much of your time taking courses in your major, so get one and finish it. Indulge your whims with electives -- go ahead and spread those around; it is good that you want to do that.<p>As for <i>what</i> to study, I'll adopt my usual advising tactic and tell you to study something <i>hard</i>. Your major is your brand; let your brand be ""interesting, hardworking, and smart"". Sciences and math are hard. Statistics, mathematics, accounting, economics. Biology, chemistry, physics. Electronics. Mechanical engineering. Linguistics. Dare I say it: Computer science. Philosophy is actually pretty good. Music can be pretty good -- both technical and artistic; takes a lot of hard work and determination; a good way to practice communication and get over your stage fright. Things that make you read and write a lot are very good -- I minored in history, it was great -- but do not <i>major</i> in ""communication"" (though if there's an elective lab course that lets you run pro-level audio and video equipment, that would be great fun) and do not waste time studying creative writing in college.<p>(You <i>really</i> can't learn to write like Roald Dahl by taking a course. Very few of the great writers ever formally studied writing, and Dahl appears to be no exception. Great creative writing is mostly about practice -- you must read a lot, and you must write a lot -- and you can get that without paying tuition, though it certainly does take time.

I once took a well-paying job, but the main language used was ColdFusion - and not just ColdFusion, but a huge, complex, disgusting ColdFusion framework that the company had written themselves and was riddled with bugs. I figured I'd be fine because of the paycheck and the prestige of the job. Switching to a new language wasn't hard or anything, but I ended up only lasting a few months, then quit, taking a significant pay cut to get away from ColdFusion. I found that I just couldn't stand the stupid language.<p>I guess my point is, when deciding whether this is the right job for you, language is a very important factor. After a little time writing in a language you don't enjoy or respect, if you're like me, you're going to start to feel creatively and intellectually unfulfilled.",1284257740

It's not like Ruby or Python where someone sat down and tried to think things all the way through.<p>So yeah, I don't think any sane PHP advocate is going to get in your face about PHP as a superior language.

Without those open minds the world would probably be an entirely different place. And not for the better",1290236136

1924037,comment,1923851,1923851,0,0,chancho,,,"This is an interesting read. One part jumped out at me (sorry for the long quote)<p><i>The purpose of the technical problem was to assess more directly candidates ability to write Haskell programs that can be used to solve real world problems, where memory usage and performance are important. The problem was all about evaluation order and memory behaviour. We started by asking candidates to look at a short program and say what shape they would expect the heap profile to be. That would then lead on to a discussion of what things are evaluated at what stage and how much memory they are taking in the meantime. For the final step we asked candidates to rewrite the program to run in constant space. We felt overall that the technical problem was quite useful and we allowed it to become a significant factor in our final decision making process.</i><p><i>The choice of problem is based on our belief that a good understanding of evaluation order is very important for writing practical Haskell programs. People learning Haskell often have the idea that evaluation order is not important because it does not affect the calculated result. It is no coincidence that beginners end up floundering around with space leaks that they do not understand.</i><p>I've written a lot of C++ and a fair amount of Haskell, and this kind reasoning about the evaluation order and space usage of Haskell a program is no less of a black art than pointer arithmetic or manual memory management in C++. In both cases, it's too steep of a learning curve to just be able to write practical programs, which is why garbage collected languages have displaced C++ in many domains.<p>It's particularly damning to say that ""good understanding of evaluation order is very important for writing practical Haskell programs"" because the easiest evaluation order to understand is strict evaluation order. In that sense, lazy evaluation is to strict evaluation as manual memory management is to garbage collection, except that the latter is supposed to be an improvement on the former.",1290236123

Zappos wants to provide an enticement to help you make the decision to leave in case you want to.<p>More importantly, Zappos realizes that for a lot of people, staying in a job is a matter of finances.

Even the rocks know it by now, 9-11 was conceived, planned and executed by US administration as an excuse to steal Iraqy oil. It's happening all over again with Iran, only this time the excuse is that Iran has nucs and we need to save the world from those evil people. How ironic. People have morals these days you see, we can't just go invade other nations when we run out of money, we need an excuse first! Terrorist retaliation, nuc disarming, or something else catchy like that. Because that's what we are, other nations raise taxes to close their deficit, we just invade the weaker instead. As for all the anti terrorism measures that have been introduced since 9-11, it's all a huge bill for the tax payers and a great inconvenience, which according to many security specialists, are completely redundant. Now with the body scanners and the invasive body search we don't even respect human rights or the US Constitution. The lobby of the manufacturing corporations who promote these and the interests of the corrupt officials who are getting their cut is stronger than legislation.

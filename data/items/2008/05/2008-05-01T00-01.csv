Don't get me wrong - I like Xobni... I am just saying this from a practical sales standpoint.<p>Considering this and considering they have to pay income tax instead of capital gains tax, they may have to sell at least a million copies to make $20 million.<p>Of course they can make it into a product with a ton more features making it worth $100 a piece in the eyes of Joe CubeDweller.",1209603309

We serve hundreds of thousands of video streams a day, and have supported up to 30k live concurrent viewers. Our site is growing every week, and we just signed a contract for a 2gbps commit in our colo. Our unique visitors are up 900% since January, and we just broke the Alexa Top 500 yesterday.<p>There are a lot of pieces that fit together to make Justin.tv work: our video cluster, IRC server, our web app, and our monitoring and search services, to name a few. Both our video and chat servers are written in the Twisted framework, and we're looking for talented engineers who want to improve these things and build more.<p>Responsibilities<p><pre><code>    * Contribute to product design and implementation discussions
    * Implement projects from the idea phase to production
    * Test and iterate code before and after production release 
</code></pre>
Qualifications<p><pre><code>    * We like dynamic languages. You should too. A lot of the things we build are in Twisted or Rails.
    * Experience building web applications.
    * A strong desire to work on website with passionate users and ideas for how to improve it.
    * Experience hacking video streams, python, Twisted or rails all a plus.
</code></pre>
While we're growing rapidly, Justin.tv is still a small, technology focused company, built by hackers for hackers. Six of our eight person team are engineers or designers. We believe in rapid development, and push out new code releases every week. We're based in a beautiful office (see pics) in the SOMA district of SF, one block from the caltrain station. If you want a fun job hacking on code that will touch a lot of people, JTV is for you.<p>Note: You must be physically present in SF to work for JTV. Completing the technical problem at <a href=""http://jtvproblems.weebly.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jtvproblems.weebly.com</a> (for non-Flash devs) will go a long way with us. Cheers!",1209601716

It's one thing to have a product, a business and be allowed the freedom to innovate.  Its another thing to be brought in and fix someone-else's problem.  Its my guess that MS wanted Xobni to re-vitalize outlook rather than advance their product.",1209601651

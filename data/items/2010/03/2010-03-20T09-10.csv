The image is often of mentarbatory discord.<p>I do not like at least modern ""free jazz"", but fortunately I still have tons of good, slightly groovier stuff available from 1920's onwards, and I think much more people would likewise find enjoyment in the classics. With the various ""internet radio"" and customised stream software, searching for these usually brings an excellent selection of music: Miles Davis, Ornette Coleman, Sun Ra, Thelonious Monk, Billie Holiday, John Coltrane.",1269078992

1206256,comment,1205163,1205163,0,0,Confusion,,,"<p><pre><code>  - One quality measure of an abstraction is the complexity
    ofits interface (ie API size).
  - Another measure is the amount of state the abstraction
    encapsulates.
</code></pre>
The simplest abstraction of many interfaces is two methods:<p><pre><code>  setParameterForNextCall(paramName, paramValue)
  call(functionName)
</code></pre>
The API is small, not complex and the amount of state is small, given that parameters are only set right before a call, all parameters are cleared after every call and no other state is retained. Yet it's clear to anyone that this isn't a good abstraction and that it doesn't result in an implementation that requires few unit tests. It requires an immense amount of documentation and allows a great many variations that yield bad/unexpected results.<p><pre><code>  Hence, good abstractions require few unit tests.
</code></pre>
Abstractions don't have unit tests: <i>implementations</i> have unit tests. It's the size and complexity of the implementation made possible by the abstraction that matters.",1269078419

1206242,comment,1204860,1205246,0,0,stse,,,"That's very subjective. It's true though that Apple has been able to sell products that generally have lower specs then their price equivalent. But if that is because of marketing, killer applications, user experience or something else isn't really clear. They're definitely not dominating any market based on number of devices though.<p>What I'm most curious about in the tablet space is if Linux, with Android, MeeGo, Chrome OS etc. will be able to shine. As many tablets will be ARM based, there will be less competition from Microsoft. With a decent distribution platform we might see a situation where developers will be able to reach more devices with Linux than with iPad/iPhone OS. Especially from a global perspective.",1269077296

The thing you quoted about Theora winning out is a perfect example of this, especially the last sentence:<p><i>Since Firefox is by far the largest HTML5 browser, encoding your video in H264 alone is shooting yourself in the foot.</i><p>Saying so completely disregards the fact that a lot of, maybe even the majority of, the video on the web now is already in h.264 alone, because that's one of the encodings that the Flash plugin supports. And when we add to that the fact that for the foreseeable future there will continue being a non-insignificant portion of people using browsers that do not implement HTML5 at all, meaning video sites which go HTML5 will still have to provide a some form of a fallback - most logically through a Flash player - a fallback that can easily be served to Firefox and Opera users, exactly the opposite of Thom's statement becomes obvious. <i>Not encoding your video in h.264 alone is shooting yourself in the foot</i> - you'd be more than doubling your storage cost and your video transcoding cost and even increasing your bandwidth bill, for no good reason whatsoever.",1269076235

3776593,comment,3776441,3776441,1,0,dalke,,,"Which is a worthless number for any meaningful comparison. The effective tax rate for Fortune 500 companies is under 20%. Quoting from the Economist, Nov. 2011 (see <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/11/focus-0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/11/focus-0</a> ):<p>The statutory federal income tax rate for big American companies is 35%. But a study by the Citizens for Tax Justice and the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, two Washington, DC-based think-tanks, has assessed the tax records of 280 companies from the Fortune 500 list with reliable pre-tax profit reports. Among these companies the average effective tax rate between 2008-10 was only 18.5%. While 71 companies paid over 30% of their profits in federal income tax, 30 enjoyed negative tax rates over the whole three year period. Pepco, an electricity company, had the lowest effective tax rate of -57.6%. Wells Fargo, a bank, received the biggest tax subsidy over the three years of almost $18 billion, and was one of 25 companies which took more than half of the total $223 billion subsidy claimed. In at least one of the three years, 78 firms paid no or negative tax rates, and legally-by writing off capital investments before they actually wear out (known as ""accelerated depreciation""), making use of tax deductible stock options and industry-specific tax breaks, and offshore tax havens.",1333123157

A ""bump"" going from the screen to the bezel makes it nearly impossible to effectively touch at the edges.<p>If you extend the glass past the screen but then also introduce a ""bump"" to transition to plastic or some other material, you either make the device bulkier, make it uncomfortable to hold, or both.<p>> <i>an aluminum back</i><p>Meh.

3776557,comment,3776546,3776546,1,0,aaron_k,,,"Qmato is the first web/mobile site to provide truly occasion-appropriate, personalized restaurant recommendations. Qmato solves a common problem that no other site or app can: What is the best restaurant for me, for this particular occasion? We do this by scoring restaurants on over 250 different sentiment metrics drawn from an analysis of millions of reviews and reports - so unlike other services, Qmato actually knows what each restaurant is like, and what is <i>specifically</i> good about each restaurant. This means we are able provide recommendations that are truly tailored to the occasion (and to your taste as well).<p>Heres an example: Lets say you want to eat outside and enjoy the weather. You don't just want a place that has any old outdoor seating, even if it has a high rating and even if your social network has Liked it a lot. That's all well and good, but it doesnt help you identify what you really want: a place that has really excellent outdoor seating. A couple tables on the sidewalk of a busy street wont cut it - you want something more pleasant and secluded, where you can really enjoy the outdoors. Because Qmato scores each restaurant on the pleasantness of its outdoor seating, we can actually recommend a place where you can really enjoy the weather - and that youll truly love.<p>Or take breakfast - when you go out for breakfast, you don't just want a place that serves breakfast (whatever else might be appealing about it) - you want to go to a place that serves a <i>really excellent</i> breakfast. Knowing that this restaurant has a high rating and it also serves breakfast isnt enough. What if the high rating results from other features of the restaurant, and their breakfast is just mediocre? Qmato actually scores each restaurant on its breakfast quality, and will recommend the places that have the <i>best breakfast</i>.<p>Or even atmosphere - other services dont provide any way of identifying the best places for a quiet, intimate meal or a fun lively one. Because we score each restaurant on over a hundred different atmosphere properties, Qmato makes it easy to find the places that are the best fit for whatever atmosphere youre looking for.<p>In total, Qmato gives users direct, one-click / one-touch access to great recommendations for over 30 different kinds of restaurant experiences. Or, if you want more control, Qmatos natural language keyword search lets you describe anything youre looking for - atmosphere descriptions, service, price, value, food qualities, recommended items, etc. (Oh yes, Qmato also provides carefully curated item recommendations, so you wont have to puzzle over the menu when you arrive.)<p>On Qmato, there is no need to dig through hundreds or thousands reviews to find a good place, like youd have to on Yelp. And unlike other restaurant recommendation products (like Ness or CleverSense), Qmato recommends restaurants that will actually provide the kind of experience you're looking for. Thats something these other services simply cant do.<p>Now, we know that occasion isn't the only thing that matters. Thats why we developed Qmetric - our proprietary ranking algorithm that optimally combines the occasion category score with overall rating, general preferences you can set explicitly (e.g. quiet, good value, creative food, vegetarian friendly, etc.), and preferences machine-learned from your ratings. Qmetric ensures that for every search, your results are always sorted in the all-around optimal way, and that you always get great recommendations.<p>Qmato lists over 800,000 restaurants nationwide. Currently, Qmato is available as a website and a mobile-optimized website at qmato.com. Native apps are under development.<p>Any feedback would be much appreciated!<p>Aaron",1333122782

Obviously in life other non-technical issues can take precedence.<p>The New Yorker online edition (archives.newyorker.com) consists of a javascript interface that displays 760x556 jpegs for browsing. Now we get to the good part: if you click on a page to zoom, it brings up a 1228x900 png overlaid on a 1228x900 jpg. The png is the high frequency information (abrupt black and white transitions) and the jpg is the low frequency information (large swathes of colour). Im confident the data is processed by DjVu to perform this image separation (if you dive the image urls djvu is one of the directory names). The hilarious part is that they OCR their images and this text is in the html. Even more fun is that there is a separate 1613x1181 jpg when you print from the online edition but as we know jpg is totally inappropriate for black and white text.<p>So to summarize the data is already passed through a DjVu toolchain to generate a djvu file but they render all of these ridiculous image sizes in various formats to fit their terrible viewer.<p>I dont have an iPad so I cant confirm but Im pretty sure the Kindle New Yorker app runs on the same Adobe AIR platform.

3776382,comment,3775431,3775431,-1,0,EGreg,,,"Look people. We all know that SOPA sucked. Personally I called my congressman and suggested the following amendment to SOPA:<p>When the dept of justice (or whoever is tasked with prosecuting these sites) finds a site, they contact it and issue a invitation to participate in domestic proceedings, and the invitation is good for a certain period (30 days for example). During this time, the site can respond, realize the problem, maybe make amends or reach a settlement. If they do not <i>respond</i> within the time period, then they are considered in default, and US financial institutions, search engines etc. could be compelled block them. However, at any time they can start legal proceedings within the US, and try to get reinstated, until the statute of limitations runs out (a few years).<p>This would have introduced the proper concepts of due process (inviting them to participate and offer them an opportunity to resolve the matter before taking drastic measures), jurisdiction (only US financial companies would be compelled to stop dealing with them, and possibly search engines, etc.) And IMHO it would be a good compromise.<p>Finally, here is why it would work: it takes a while from a site to grow from an insignificant pirate hub (where people can download movies, etc.) to something that lots of people in the US know. Remember, the problem is only that US citizens are downloading pirated US movies & shows (which cost a lot to make) from abroad. Once lots of people in the US know how to get to it using domain X or method X, then the entertainment industry can take notice. By that time, the site has been operating for a while (probably over a year). What is another 30 days at this point. The due process should take place. The entertainment industry is presumably going after big fish, not fly by night file hosters. So there is no reason to shoot first and ask questions later.<p>I am probably going to get downvoted because I am talking about SOPA and saying it could work using some sort of compromise. But I try to be open minded. Those who know me know I criticize copyright, but I don't think our society is ready for a completely wikipedia-like approach to art. I have thought about the issue and in practical terms, copyright is actually quite useful as it enforces copyleft. And in fact, using copyright and copyleft, we have a competition of content creation by open groups and by proprietary interests. Which is good for society. Patents in software, on the other hand, should be abolished :)",1333121191

I only mean to clarify expectations with the use of Micro's. A whole swarm of them grinding through a work queue in random order is great; using them as the backbone of your web presence will have pain points. (Yes you can put 20-50 of them behind an ELB, but at that point why not run a handful of Mediums or a few Larges).<p>Anyone with a Blitz.io account, please feel free to setup this exact configuration and run the benchmark for 1hr with the same load to verify the meltdown.<p>[UPDATE] Ewan, I am not knocking your article, I wouldn't expect most people to be familiar with the ins and outs of every cloud provider. The tips and techniques are great regardless of the actual performance on a Micro (and applies to anyone trying to scale WordPress). Just wanted to clarify for anyone getting excited that they can now run their Fortune 500 website on a single AWS Micro that there are nasty surprises lurking just under the surface.<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts_micro_instances.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/co...</a>",1333120837

However, modeling application processes effectively is harder and requires deeper thought and a more thorough understanding of REST.<p>I've always thought the key to understanding REST is understanding idempotence. Is HTTP request to mark an order as paid idempotent? If so, a PUT/PATCH should be fine. If not (say, you're actually transferring funds) then a POST should be used. This key principle will help make your URL design choices much easier. In your example, the PATCH API appears idempotent, making the suggested POST replacement sort of confusing to me.<p>When it comes to modeling application processes using HTTP, understanding which requests are repeatable without consequence and which aren't is very important. It's hard to talk about modeling processes RESTfully without talking about idempotence. It's at the heart of the protocol's design.<p>RESTful thinking needn't be harmful for application processes as long as you do it effectively.",1333120624

If you know you're going to cover multiple platforms from the beginning, you will do a lot of things to make that a lot easier.<p>Most of those would be written to target a graphics framework (like OpenGL) for the visual elements. Then, for each platform there will be a host that OS-specific things like file & network access. You can also use libraries to abstract that for you.<p>So the amount that needs to be rewritten depends on how similar the new platform is to the old ones. Going from PC to iOS would be about 40%. Going to Nintendo Wii, maybe 70%.<p>Unless the platform is particularly unusual, most of the hard problems were solved in the first release, adding additional platforms is fairly mechanical.

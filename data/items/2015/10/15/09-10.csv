10392203,comment,10390732,10392125,0,0,simonh,,,"I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re arguing against automation, just that completely driverless vehicles won&#x27;t be the optimum path. I think there will be some applications for which fully driverless vehicles will be fine, such as trucks transporting goods between loading bays and taxis collecting and dropping off at street addresses, and many others where some level of driver control will be useful.<p>Take their example of submarines. Fully autonomous submarines are completely possible, but what they point out is that some level of human control is more useful. They don&#x27;t say why, but my guess is that this is because if the sub comes across something unusual that merits further investigation, humans are better at making that judgement call than a robot would. The same principle applies to the Mars rovers. But it also applies to plenty of routine uses of vehicles. Most of the time I&#x27;m driving from my house to a car park or street parking space and such journeys are probably completely automatable. But sometimes I arrive at e.g. a country fair and the parking is in a field and I know I want to park over there in a place which will soon be shaded by that tree, and not in a different place where it looks a bit muddy. At times like that I would want much more direct control over the vehicle and an automated system would not be able to make such decisions for me.<p>So while the article does a poor job saying so, I think the point is that 100% full driverless automation isn&#x27;t the best answer in every situation. It might be a fine solution for many purposes, but not all. They&#x27;re arguing against a (perhaps imagined and possibly straw man) maximalist automation position such as &#x27;in 20 years time no cars will have manual controls&#x27;.",1444902249

For the restaurant manager / head chef / lead chef, it&#x27;s generally  &quot;how much autonomy do I get with dining room design, menu design, hiring,&quot; &quot;what&#x27;s the food cost I need to beat,&quot; and/or &quot;what&#x27;s the concept (and can I play with it)?&quot;<p>If the right level of autonomy/restaurateur participation is there and they can get behind the theme/concept of the restaurant, the chef/manager takes the job. Then they get to work building a menu they like and training the staff for the experience they want.<p>WRT bringing a team with them, as high-stress a job as running a kitchen/restaurant can be, knowing already you work well with someone is worth its weight in gold.<p>Restaurateurs also are not, generally, blowing by and making whimsical changes. The margins in a restaurant, after food cost, salaries, fixed costs, are usually not super high, so if they have money in it they&#x27;re thinking a lot about how to maximize the ability for that restaurant to grow its business (or increase margins).<p>Luckily or unluckily, there&#x27;s not a ton of strings to pull to manipulate the restaurant&#x27;s profit:<p>- The rent will be the rent. Changing locations is a huge sunk cost in both capital and customers, since existing ones won&#x27;t know where you&#x27;ve moved to (or be able to walk down the street to get to you) and new ones won&#x27;t know yet why they should stop in.<p>- Salaries will have a floor for the area your restaurant is in. You can pay more, but in any case once you get to minimum wage, yeah.<p>The main way to modulate the profit point is to play with costs on the ingredients. You see pretty quick that if you cut ingredient quality by too much, you have to start dropping price points because people won&#x27;t overpay by too much for crappy food. And some venues or concepts won&#x27;t support breaking out of the average price for prepared food in a region, i.e. you&#x27;ve gotta be doing special to charge $20 for a cheeseburger.<p>So, you look at how cheap you can keep ingredients for the quality you want on the other end, And how well you can build the dining experience to resonate with the target customer so they fall in love with your restaurant and keep showing up.<p>The restaurateur is thinking about that a lot, as much if not more than the on-the-ground leadership he/she hired.",1444902125

Is it just the general variability of lab results and similar variability could be find in quest diagnostics as well?<p>Because Edison and the dilution procedure produce low quality results.  Thus for a large number of the tests Theranos is less accurate than traditional methods.<p>> 3rd Theme: almost all people say Theranos is dramatically cheaper than competitors. How is that possible when they are using the same equipment as everybody else for most of the tests? Is it a process innovation in operations rather than from Edison/better equipment tech? Or are they just subsidizing these costs and being cheaper and possible have bad unit economics?<p>The above is possible because they are not currently focused on profit, rather market share.  All that money that they have raised has had to go somewhere.",1444901808

DeviceAtlas adds a few µs per request. Typically this does not cause much of an issue. Example: if a load balancer is serving 20,000 requests per second with 80% CPU, that&#x27;s 40µs of CPU time per request on a machine that can\ngo up to 50µs. If we add 4µs to that we reach 88% of CPU under the same load, and the end user performance is not degraded in any meaningful way.<p>- <i>Memory footprint</i>: DeviceAtlas lets you configure the per-device property set to tailor the memory and performance impact.

Well, I suppose one reason may be that it may not exist, but it seems like it should be pretty cheap to pay some low-end Android manufacturer to <i>remove</i> a few features from their design.  Or maybe you even buy &quot;normal&quot; hardware and strip out radios.  At some level, the wallet manufacturers are all trusting someone, as I don&#x27;t think any have designed their own low-level components.

Not much of our millions of years of evolution has fully prepared us to tackle the slew of random events and conditions the daily driver has to face. And while our hundreds of thousands of years of tool use has certainly managed to have some influence on our genome we&#x27;re still barely equipped to operate tools that increase our speed, strength, and carrying capacity by orders of magnitude. This is demonstrated every day by the astonishingly huge number of terrible accidents caused by these tools. Automobiles are responsible for perhaps the most (no doubt due to the vastly varying levels of skill and practice across their operators). Human decision making is simply not fast enough to handle all of the situations one can encounter while operating a motor vehicle and is certainly many times slower in any given situation than a highly optimized specialized system designed to solve that type of problem. The area where human brains currently have the advantage is in reacting to novel edge cases, but at that point providing adequate autonomous conveyance at safer-than-human accident rates becomes a numbers game.",1444899936

Of course, perfectly decent, well-meaning and good-hearted white people sat around dinner tables during apartheid and slavery and said exactly the same thing.    History has proven them wrong, and in fact if we imagine popular support for uncontrolled global immigration, it&#x27;s rather easy to conceive a practical implementation - quotas gradually increased, borders lowered - it could be achieved in a controlled way.<p>I also hear the &#x27;why should we?&#x27; response.  Indonesia has squandered its natural resources - aka it&#x27;s their own fault they&#x27;re poor.  But none of us would stand in front of a classful of Indonesian schoolchildren and say this.  Being born in a rich western country is a colossal slice of luck, not a personal achievement.  The fact is that thinking of people in terms of nations tends to dehumanise them, and that&#x27;s one of the reasons why greater migration and a blurring of borders would be a good thing.<p>The economic arguments around immigration have raged in the press here in the UK for the last few years.  Here at least the general academic consensus has been that it&#x27;s a net plus, and that the additional burden on state benefits is outweighed by the economic benefits of a well-motivated and grateful migrant workforce. The risk to any benefits system is not more people per se, but that it will be abused - ie the development of a benefits culture, where people choose not to work because the safety net will support them.  It&#x27;s up to us to decide whether this attitude is more likely in the indigenous population or with recent economic migrants.<p>The real barrier to adoption is lack of popular support, and I accept that few people are going to agree with me on this issue.

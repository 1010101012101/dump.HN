I mean, could write Scala in TextMate, too, if I had the jones for it. But I could also <i>not</i>, and use IntelliJ, because I value having tools that are able to improve my productivity. (And decrease my frustration; by sticking with the JVM I have the benefit of not have to rely on Mono, whose GC, from experience, I do not trust in long-running processes; after spending a year owning a trivial Mono ASP.NET app that presented no end of troubles, I am very happy not needing to have a watchdog ready to kick it over when it undergoes its daily spaz-out.)<p>Xamarin Studio is not an acceptable product, either. I&#x27;ve been trying to use it for a couple weeks now and about ready to pitch a computer out a window--the basic functions of <i>editing code</i> are magnificently broken and have been for a long time. Random phantom line breaks in the editor that aren&#x27;t in the code file, bad auto-indenting, phantom error highlighting, no partial-build error solving--and Visual Studio doesn&#x27;t work on OS X. (To say nothing of the &quot;you have to restart because XS forgot how to talk to xbuild&quot; bugs...) That leaves the shitty bodges you well-actually&#x27;d your way into or not doing .NET at all. The latter makes a lot more sense for a lot more people.<p>I really enjoy C# and F# and I&#x27;d love to use .NET more if the frustrations in using it on not-Windows were not of such a magnitude. I am critical because it should be better and isn&#x27;t.

The other company can do anything it wants with that data.  This is bad for your visitors and bad for you as well.  We know there are sites willing to do this, but they&#x27;ve talked to us and told us how much they hate doing it.  We think it&#x27;s bad news.<p>Also, if you swap pixels and you both target eachother, you will absolutely be driving up your marketing costs.  And that&#x27;s also really bad.<p>With Connect, we&#x27;re serving as the audience traffic cop, maybe audience escrow is a better way of looking at it.  No data changes hands or control and no bids get jacked up. It&#x27;s better on all fronts.<p>Instead of swapping pixels back and forth, you can use software to manage access.<p>2. Absolutely not.  Nothing is public.  All profiles are locked down behind a registration wall and behind other requirements like &quot;has tag installed&quot; and &quot;has at least 1000 cookies&quot;.  We have no intention of publishing a public list of people using Connect.  Right now you can find people to connect with by syncing with your LinkedIn contacts, by directly inviting people to view your profile, or by seeing who&#x27;s connected to people you are connected to.<p>In addition, there&#x27;s hardly any hard data shared on the profiles.  We include a rough range of audience size and a list of who their connections are...and that data is available only to people you connect with...who must be using PA.  So it&#x27;s all very restrictive.<p>3. Stay tuned! :)<p>4. Stay tuned! :)<p>5. No data is being sold.  No data is changing hands.

This caused ample moral licensing, letting most development team members and business people cut down on the unpleasant aspects.<p>This collective ball dropping was fortunately mitigated by a surplus of employees happy to pick up this poor, unloved ball.

The one that I&#x27;d recommend here is based on Little&#x27;s Law, which gives a limit on throughput based on the number and latency of outstanding requests: Concurrency = Latency * Bandwidth.<p>It turns out that each core has can only have 10 requests for memory outstanding (line fill buffers).  Since in the end these requests are coming from RAM, each request has a latency of about 100 cycles.  Since each request is for 64B, this gives us a maximum throughput of about about:<p><pre><code>  Bandwidth = 10 * 64B in flight / 100 cycles\n  Bandwidth = about 6B per cycle\n</code></pre>\nAt a 3.5 GHz clock frequency, this would suggest that we have a hard cap at about 3.5 billion cycles/s * 6 bytes/cycle = 21 GB/s, which is mighty close to the actual limit! The numbers are fudged a little bit because it&#x27;s not actually a flat 100 cycle latency to access RAM, but I think this limit is more relevant and indicative here than the instruction count.",1400017275

But on the question of how hard it is to find applicants, it depends what you hold constant: the qualifications or the compensation. Here we&#x27;re holding the compensation constant and raising the qualification bar however high we can. I&#x27;m sure hoards of people would apply to become CEO of Microsoft if that was a thing you could do, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the position is overpaid. The experiment here is to see if you could get much better teachers by widening the pool of potential applicants to people who who wouldn&#x27;t normally want to do that, by a) making the pay competitive with other high-skill industries and b) cutting out a lot of the bullshit involved in applying that skill to teaching children. That pool would surely include plenty of people who are already rockstar teachers, but additionally lots of people who think of themselves as bound for, say, business consulting or finance or software engineering. How would you choose among your applicants? I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of answers to &quot;if I could turn anyone into a teacher, who would it be? And I how could I maximize their abilities?&quot; Maybe this is actually lots of different experiments with different selection criteria and different degrees of freedom in applying themselves to the task (e.g., in defining curriculum).",1400017227

If we have existing partners we work with, why wouldn&#x27;t we just have them place our pixel on their site/in their container tag? Then we could use this with whatever network we wanted instead of being locked in with Perfect Audience.  The Bid Guard piece could be interesting in some cases, but depending on other targeting options being used, may be unnecessary.<p>2. Do companies need to make their audience profile publicly visible?  The information that would be listed (site traffic, types of visitors, etc.) is VERY valuable info to some companies that are not traditional publishers and don&#x27;t want to publicize that data.<p>3. Echoing jamiequint&#x27;s suggestion for the option to simply buy access.  In some cases, it may not make sense for a company to offer up their user data as currency depending on how they approach privacy, but buying access to other&#x27;s may still be fine.<p>4. Also echoing the thought on enriched tagging.  Being able to bid up on someone who purchased compared to someone who just visited is VERY valuable.<p>5. Have companies needed to change their privacy policies as a result of using this?  Seems like you would need to make it clear that you are selling your user&#x27;s data if you participate, even if the exchange isn&#x27;t a direct monetary one.<p>6. Does this work in conjunction with cookie syncing providers like LiveRamp, etc. to tie everything together in one&#x27;s DMP? It would seem you could only account for overlap from visitors you&#x27;ve tracked with the Perfect Audience tag, but there may be existing audience data in a DMP that an advertiser would like to dedupe against.<p>7. Do you provide any reporting insight into cross-site behavior?  Seems like if both partners opted-in to it, that could provide some really unique data for both parties.  For example, is the cross-pollination providing mutually beneficial results?  If so, it may make sense for the advertisers to engage in additional co-marketing opportunities.",1400016158

Which is not what I said.<p>It says a lot: If you can do feature exctraction on a social problem <i>that</i> easily, it means something is really screwd.<p>I also think there&#x27;s an impedance mismatch here between what you say and what I understand, and vice versa. I agree on the fact that people living in ghettos must be empowered, and a way to do that in my mind was to get their children a better education, easing the financial burden on the parents, and shielding the children from their <i>toxic</i> environment.<p>If I went overboard, it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s too important to let ourselves dwell on rhetorics. My reasoning was: We may not be able to help the parents (they had their lives), but the children still have a chance. The parents played their turn, now it&#x27;s the children&#x27;s turn at life.<p>But I agree on your point about draining the youth from these communities. I haven&#x27;t seen it that way.<p>{\nI&#x27;m saying that the way to fix the issues associated with these areas isn&#x27;t a white knight swooping in to save the poor colored kids; that.does.not.work. It&#x27;s for these areas to be empowered through community investment to fix it for themselves.\n}<p>Which would be easier if they had a better education, education which would be easier to obtain if they didn&#x27;t have to hustle to eat, or have to choose which child to send to school, or chose if the child is going to eat or get an education.<p>>Do you know the best way to empower a community? Education >focused INSIDE of it.<p>I&#x27;d say education no matter where. As I said, my rationale is that children are too precious to waste on a social experiment of community stuff. They need education and be able to be children. \n{\nAnd for Melville: I&#x27;m not certain that his upbringing is really all that important. Your argument here is really, really weak (and is an outstanding example of Ad Hominem; what does it matter where he&#x27;s from?).

Living in a ghetto just sucks and nobody needs research or a PhD to know that. It&#x27;s just reality, man.

If qualifying costs include day-to-day healthcare or not, it depends on the policy, but it&#x27;s health insurance either way, because that&#x27;s what &#x27;insurance&#x27; means.<p>But I agree with you that a health insurance policy paying for regular expected healthcare costs is weird and different than most insurance markets in a way that makes underwriting weird. It&#x27;s still the insurance market we&#x27;ve got for health insurance in the US.",1400015662

I don&#x27;t think that these numbers hold as high for other universities, but it&#x27;s not 10 or 20 people at a school. It&#x27;s like 1/8 to 1/4 of the freshmen that may need to transfer credits.<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.mercurynews.com/education/ci_25731300/uc-nonresident-students-increase-californians-admissions-slow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mercurynews.com/education/ci_25731300/uc-nonresid...</a>",1400014858

LIBLINEAR is specifically designed for situations in which you have many features and relatively few training instances. When using a linear classifier it may make sense to simply generate as many features as you can, and then use, i.e., lasso regression in order to do feature selection. <a href=""http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/</a>",1400014802

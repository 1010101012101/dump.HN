Finding a cofounder is more a meeting of minds and interests - the ideas one has and are passionate about can be modified accordingly.<p>Every entrepreneur isn't short of ideas - but every entrepreneur in his/her social circle is a maverick of one sort or another. SO if the local concentration of mavericks isn't high it makes things difficult. Finding a cofounder is pretty hard and only something that can be done by finding someone you agree with - then trying out the relationship over a project.<p>I met my cofounder accidently - last year i had an idea and approached a couple of people cold and just tried doing a project. One of the guys i met i seemed to work with amazingly well. We sparked ideas, started creating other side projects, had complementary skills, believed in beautiful design and how simple ideas could really impact the world and above all we had the same positive attitude and stamina to make things happen (we both have great stamina and a get things done attitude). Our ideas have changed from the original one. A year later we've worked on so many things - but most importantly we can depend on eachother to make things happen. <p>Bottom line, cofounders pop up in unexpected places. Be open, talk to people you know, friends, their friends - see if anyone sparks. Its a hard road until then - but trial people out - get them involved in your project. Hidden mavericks do exist in local environments and passion is infectious.

There a few provisions one must be wary of regarding security, but for the most part I believe it is a move in a positive direction for managing web identities.",1173266616

It seems that many users are now beginning to *expect* Web 2.0 startups to provide support for it (just as they did for Firefox). I anticipate that, in the future, when big name startups like Digg and LiveJournal begin supporting OpenID, there will be a huge following by other sites as well. Put simply, crowds follow crowds.",1173265791

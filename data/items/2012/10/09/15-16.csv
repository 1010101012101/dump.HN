4632264,comment,4631362,4631362,8,0,tylerneylon,,,"Cheating without consequences hurts everyone taking the class. I'm disappointed to see so many comments implying it's fine to just let that go.<p>My thought on this comes from a good chunk of direct experience: I've taught a number of courses to undergrads at NYU, as well as having about 5 summers of teaching experience in programming and cryptography at summer camps including CTY.<p>Imagine all students are given a button that says ""give me an A,"" and they can press it if they choose, or do all the course work and possibly get a worse grade. Even if you chose to do the work because you were self-motived, you'd still be tempted to press the A button to guarantee a good grade.<p>That's an exaggeration, but the point is the same. The easier it is to get _any_ kind of validation without real work, the harder it is to learn.<p>It is harder to stay motivated, and the feedback received becomes less meaningful. It is even disappointing to simply know many of your fellow students probably cheated without consequences.<p>I do believe in seeing answers after doing the work, but it is just common sense to avoid posting them before things are due, and to support clear communications between the instructors and students about the details of posting answers.",1349798364

4632260,comment,4631270,4631800,3,0,freehunter,,,"I've thought long about this issue, as I did a paper in marketing class about the threat of Amazon to brick and mortar stores. I don't think an Amazon showroom is really the best answer. Sears tried that (and still has some of these stores). Volume is very low. It works best for catalog items, and catalogs are fairly rare.<p>The ability to touch and feel is a value-add, but just one of many. The pimply teenagers you mention are something I feel needs to change. The biggest value-add these stores can have is information and strong recommendations. Basically, if someone who knows what they are doing cannot recommend this product over that product, don't stock this product. That way when people walk into the store, the salesman can ask what they are looking for and recommend the best product they can buy for their needs. This keeps cost down and having a knowledgeable sales staff is a huge win for everyone.<p>Right now in Best Buy, all I can really do is look at what is available and then research it online for more specs and reviews, combining the best of both worlds. This is time consuming and unproductive in the long run. Asking a sales member for advice is worthless currently. This is what needs to change for Best Buy, in my opinion. The best product for my needs, recommended by a salesman who knows what he is doing, available instantly.",1349798342

That's not to say yours can't be successful but if you'd like it to stand out you need to differentiate yourself somehow. Right now you've basically got a todo list app that lets you share lists via a public URL. It's very simple (that's neither good or bad, it just is).<p>So considering how simple the concept is, I think there are a few things to think about that would make this valuable and stand out from the crowd.<p>First, focus on convenience. There are a billion todo lists all approaching different aspects of the task management problem and approaching it in different ways. Your approach is my favorite of all - just a list that you can check stuff off of. Its perfect. But I won't use it unless its easier and more convenient to use than any other option. So I need an app (a mobile web site will suffice which I see you already have but can use improvement). I need a way to come back in case I forget the URL of my list. I just need to be able to whip out my phone/tablet/laptop/browser and be able to get creating/checking off/reading my todos in no more than 2 or 3 steps.<p>Once you get convenience down, then work on design. You're off to a great start. There no frills, its super simple and minimal and its really great but it doesn't have that intangible thing that makes it memorable. You're definitely on the right track and I wouldn't tell you to add anything but just to refine what you have. Focus on typography and UI interaction.<p>And if this is meant for teams then I think you'll need to create a login system and some more privacy. I don't always feel comfortable putting all my todos in public even if they're only available via a special URL. A lot of things can happen to a URL. I think its great that you have a lazy login system but to me the fact that I can't save my own account and come back to it later to see all my lists and all my tasks, and see who on my team is currently sharing tasks wit me makes this feel like a one-off app. Like something you use for a day then forget about. But if I could use the app, decide I like it, then create a permanent account I'd be much more likely to return in the future and be invested in the product.<p>I don't care how many trillion todo apps we have out there, there are never enough. I like what you're doing and I'd say focus on convenience and design and if you're serious about making this for teams then give people the option to create permanent accounts. I probably won't use this today or tomorrow or next week but I did sign up for mailing list and I'm definitely excited to see what you come up with in the future.",1349797639

For car one, the salesman kept hedging of a price. The price that I knew I could get according to my research wasn't even close to the price he quoted. He was actually quite pleasant to deal with, but I just had a feeling that the dealership wanted to keep prices high.<p>At a different dealer for the same car, the salesman wouldn't even give me a price for the car until they saw my trade-in. I walked out of that place immediately.<p>For the car that I ultimately bought, I walked into the sales office with my wife and two kids. He immediately setup a test drive (including our car seats). When we got back, we quickly went through the options we'd need and the price of the car. It was all very transparent, and with the manufacturer incentives (end of the model year) it was a pretty reasonable price (well below invoice), and I was very happy with it. I actually liked the first car better, but was very happy with the one I ended up with.<p>Because of how that guy treated us, I'd go back to him to by multiple cars in the future.

4632096,comment,4631373,4631373,8,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Sigh, I wonder why people write stories like this.<p>Data Center servers don't suck, and I'd bet that most folks running them understand what their utilization is. Blekko has over 1500 servers in its Santa Clara facility and we know pretty much exactly how utilized they are, but that is because we designed the system that way.<p>Its funny how things have come full circle. Back in the 70's you might have a big mainframe in the machine room, it was so expensive that the accounting department required you to get maximum use out of the asset, so you had batch jobs that ran 24/7. You charged people by the kilo-core-second to use economics to maximize their value.<p>Then minicomputers, and later large multi-CPU microcomputer servers (think Sun E10000 or the IBM PowerPC series) replaced mainframes they  didn't cost as much so the pressure to 'get the return' was a bit lower, you could run them at 50% utilization and they still cost less than you'd expect to pay for equivalent mainframe power.<p>Then the dot.com explosion and suddenly folks were 'co-locating' a server in a data center because it was cheaper to get decent bandwidth there rather than run it the last mile to where your business was. But you didn't need a whole lot of space for a couple of servers, just a few 'U' (1.5"" each of vertical space) in a 19"" rack. And gee, some folks said why bring your own server, we can take a machine and put a half dozen web sites on it and then you could could pay like 1/6th the cost of 4U of rack space in the Colo for your server. Life was good (as long as you weren't co-resident with a porn or warez site :-)<p>Then, at the turn of the century, the Sandia 'cheap supercomputer' and NASA Beowulf papers came out and everyone wanted to put a bunch of 'white box' servers in racks to create their own 'Linux Cluster' and the era of 'grid' computing was born.<p>The interesting thing about 'grid' computing though was that you could buy 128 generic machines for about $200K which would out perform a $1.2M big box server. The accountants were writing these things off over 3 years so the big box server cost the company $400K/year in depreciation costs, the server farm maybe $70K/year (if you include switches and such like) so it really didn't matter to the accountants if the server farm was less 'utilized' since the dollars were so much lower but the compute needs were met.<p>Now that brings us up to the near-present. these 'server farms' provided compute at hitherto un-heard of low costs, and access to the web became much more ubiquitous. That set up the situation where even if you could offer a service where you got just a few dollars per 1,000 requests to this farm, like a real farm harvesting corn, you made it up in volume. Drive web traffic to this array of machines (which have a fixed cost to operate) and turn electrons into gold.\nIf you can get above about $5 revenue per thousand queries ($5 RPM) you can pretty much profitably run your business from any modern data center.<p>But what if you can't get $5 RPM? Or your traffic is diurnal and you get $5 RPM during the day but $0.13 RPM at night? Then your calculation gets more complex, and of course what if you have 300 servers, 150 of which are serving and 150 of which are 'development' so you really have to cover the cost of all of them from the revenue generated by the 'serving' ones.<p>Once you start getting into the ""business"" of a web infrastructure it gets a bit more complicated (well there are more things to consider, the math is pretty much basic arithmetic). And 'efficiency' suddenly becomes something you can put a price on.<p>Once you get to that point, you can point at utilization and say 'those 3 hours of high utilization made me $X' and suddenly the accountants are interested again. For companies like Google whose business is information 'crops', they were way ahead of others in computing these numbers, Amazon also because well they sell price this stuff with EC2 and AWS and  S3 and they need to know what prices are 'good' and which are 'bad.' It is 'new' to older businesses that have yet to switch over to this model. And that is where a lot of folks are making their money (you pay one price for the 'cloud' which is cheaper than you had been paying, so you don't analyze what it would cost to do your own 'cloud' type deployment). That will go away (probably 5 to 10 years from now) as folks use savings in that infrastructure to be more competitive.",1349796929

But as you can see from my second link, many (most?) physicists insist that we can derive a ""probability"" from a complex number.  Note that such probability would then be an actual real world probability, where the universe itself is uncertain about what to do.  True non-determinism.<p>It's only natural.  At the experimental level, the researcher does observe Born statistics.  Same setup, different results, so there <i>is</i> probability in the territory after all.<p>There's a problem with that however: The equations, which make such wonderfully accurate predictions, (i) are dederministic, and (ii) do not state at any point that the blob of amplitude we don't see disappear in a puff of smoke.  They merely say that the blobs eventually stop interacting.  The same way that if you launch a photon to outer space, never to meet it again, it won't disappear the instant it reaches the boundary of our observable universe.  If you insist on a mono world, you have to assert that the other blob, despite being predicted by those otherwise accurate equations, somehow doesn't exist when you don't see it.<p>One way to do it is to believe that, <i>contrary to what the equations say</i>, the blob you don't see does disappear in a puff of smoke.  Its amplitudes are literally zeroed out behind your back.  In hindsight, this one looks nuts to me.  I mean, how can we justify distrusting accurate equations in a way that doesn't even make experimental predictions?<p>Another way is to call the square moduli of those amplitude ""probabilities"", and pretend that because it's probabilities, the blob you are not in isn't real.  But the equations do not make any difference between the two blobs.  Then how come the other blob is less real than our own?<p>To me, those two explanations really feel bizarre.  You have to start from a mono world assumption to come up with that.  An easy mistake to make, since personal experience is telling us all the time that there is only one world.  A bit like a leaf in a binary tree: its ancestors form a line, not a tree.  But Kolmogorov complexity says a literal interpretation of the equations (which means many world) is simpler than anything else we currently know about.  So to hell with personal experience (which by the way is responsible for much worse whackery than mono world).<p>Now there <i>is</i> a way out: we can admit that <i>current</i> physics imply many worlds, but insist that <i>real</i> physics probably don't.  Current physics are not complete after all.  We may have big surprises.  This argument is certainly be much saner than the Copenhagen interpretation.  So much that it does lower my probability for many worlds somewhat.  Just not enough to squash my confidence. :-)<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_space"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_space</a>",1349796622

There is no reason to be scared of RoR, but it can be frustrating. I'm just starting to feel more at ease with RoR in the past few months. I really like it and would encourage you to learn it. If nothing else RoR developers make more money.<p>Long story short if you are patient with RoR I think is a great asset to have in your programming toolbelt. But be prepared to hit the wall when you try to do something that is very easy to do in PHP but at least tricky with RoR. I had a lot of problems with routing, subfolders, the asset pipeline, gem dependencies. Running RoR on a windows machine is kind of a nightmare.<p>Here are the details - this is kind of long;<p>I really like the organization that is enforced with RoR, although to some degree you can get some of that with a PHP MVC based framework.<p>I have a love hate relationship with it depending on what I am trying to do. I really like RoR features like dynamic find methods for db queries, but there are are moments when I hit the wall with the limitations in RoR that I want to ditch it to go back to PHP. Debugging statements especially in the view with helpers can be hard to figure out. PHP is nice when a single line of code fails the line where the error occurred is easy figure out. This is not always the case with RoR.<p>My biggest advice when learning RoR? Skip everything as it relates to coffeescript and the asset pipeline, just include your css/js as standard html tags in your views. There may be a big advantage to coffeescript/asset pipeline for some people, but the learning curve is steep, and it is utterly ridiculous for an app to fail due to compiling js/css and the asset pipeline. And this happened a lot early on. This is the thing I hate the most of RoR. My experience was that coffeescript and asset pipeline while running in production did not provide enough of a benefit to offset the time wasted to resolve the errors.<p>The failures I've had with the asset pipeline has been maddening. My first error on a deployed app in production was a css file that was not 'compiled'. The magic at times can be great until it isn't.<p>The PHP documentation is so clear and easy to understand, while RoR documentation has a tendency to be oblique and lacks examples. I'm on the same page as hekker mentioning the faults I have with documentation.<p>One of the best thing about RoR is the ability to leverage gems in your own code base, it really accelerates things when you want to add new features quickly. The drawback is that most of those gems do a lot of things behind the scenes stuff and again you might hit the wall.<p>These are some notes I made when I started sketching out a future blog post for my experience with Rails. This is mostly negative stuff. However even with all these negative bullet points I would definitely do it again and will use it more often going forward;<p>Documentation is subpar compared to PHP - php has so many well illustrated examples right in the documentation, RoR doesn't always cover that.<p>Even looking for the find method attached to ActiveRecord or ActiveModel is confusing - a find method with no record fails miserable, i.e. record = Record.find(value that does not exist in the db) -> FAIL<p>deployment is a pain in the ass, and its more expensive to deploy using rails, compared to PHP.<p>With php you just send the files up via FTP - Rails doesn't work that way\ndifference in the gemfile comparing Linux to Windows: your css/js files need to be 'compiled' using RoR<p>I needed to add 2 additional gems to get my stuff to work on linux environment, execjs and therubyracer. These do not work on windows, at least without some serious work involved that is beyond my knowledge. I had a devil of a time getting rails and mysql to work on windows. I already had apache and mysql for PHP development and I did not want to install a bitnami RoR package.<p>The Windows Ruby interpreter crashes frequently, even just on tripping on rails automatic includes for css and js.<p>Not happy with error messages, can be very hard to decipher what is going on at least in the beginning. Got easier as time went by BUT sometimes you'd get an error related to a view or form helper, but it would say something like ""no route for YZ"" which would seem to indicate the problem was in the route not the view.<p>Some IDEs have issues with ROR ERB files, i.e. they would not highlight appropriately or consistently.<p>Had a nightmare trying to namespace controllers - putting controllers into a subfolder responded very differently.<p>Sometimes it is just too much magic going on.<p>The differences between environments - js/css includes would work fine on local environment but not on hosting environment.<p>It is an opinionated framework - and sometimes I don't like those opinions<p>Saw weird errors in partial files that would fail when included, but if the code was just put into a single file there was no issue.",1349796474

Both students readily admitted to what had happened- neither was trying to hide anything. Nonetheless, the professor gave my friend a two letter grade demotion and the person whom he helped an F.

Learning this as an adult is impressive and probably exceptional, but it's a phenomenon we're all familiar with.  We all know people who behave like this reflexively and have done so their entire adult lives.  It can be pleasant to hang out with people like that in a heterogeneous group where not everyone is comfortable with everyone else, but they make damned unsatisfying friends and lovers.  Policing comfort zones is a sure-fire intimacy killer, and it isn't exactly a triumph of empathy to avoid uncomfortable topics of conversation, even if it requires prodigious <i>skill</i> at empathy.  Children of troubled and violent households, such as Bill Clinton, are the poster children for glib empathy that is a mile wide and an inch deep.  (No political aspersions meant, by the way; I liked him as a politician and a president.)<p>I would argue that in this case we are seeing a misguided (and probably temporary) ""zeal of the convert"", and by convert I mean someone who has discovered the practical value of this Clintonesque ""emotional easing.""  Emotional easing is much like quantitative easing:  it shifts unpleasantness out of the current context.  It's a valuable tool, but it can't be applied universally.  I'm not comfortable calling it empathy, either.  ""Perking up"" when another person's uncomfortable emotions come to the fore and steering the conversation away teaches them that their problems are their own, and that their full selves are excluded while a partial self (with unpleasantness filtered out) is welcome.  That's appropriate in some social contexts, but not all, not by a long shot, just like quantitative easing is only appropriate in certain contexts.  And it's the opposite of empathy, even though executing it requires a limited use of empathy.  Empathy means feeling what another person is feeling because your human bonds transcend the difference between you, not strategically tapping into their problematic feelings so you can override them with your own more attractive and pleasant ones.",1349796449

Then they would claim that child owed them money because that child's uterus benefits from the characteristic of the original uterus they provided.<p>The problem doesn't lay around the idea that Monsanto owns the seed they created. I don't dispute that. The problem is that they claim that they own the rights to anything resulting from that seed forever in the future, including cross pollination. Therefore, they feel fully justified in suing a farmer simply because his neighbor grows his crop from Monsanto seed and bees cross pollinated the crops.<p>The best defense I've heard against Monsanto is that Monsanto's seeds are contaminating ""pure"" or ""natural"" crops of soybeans. Which is probably where the argument that the seeds are indistinguishable from natural ones and resulting foods do not need a label telling the consumer the soybeans involved are genetically modified comes from. In that case Monsanto wants both sides covered to their advantage; ie, the seed is unique enough to allow for patent protection but no different than a natural one so you don't need to be told that it is genetically modified.",1349796430

You have to ask for the files and they'll let you know when they're ready, this takes time (up to several hours).<p>AIUI they essentially fill up each Pod with incoming data and, when it's full it goes into a low power mode where they spin down all of the disks in that Pod.<p>Restore requests (from many users) will usually span quite a few Pods so they batch up requests for each Pod so that can minimise the number of times that drives in a Pod need to be spun up to copy off files. Rather than spinning up and down once every 10 minutes to service 36 requests over 6 hours they wait 6 hours, spin up once and service all 36 requests for that pod in one go. (Figures are for example only.)<p>(Small restores may be instantaneous if the Pod is still being filled or just happens to be spun up for restore soon. Large restores will more than likely span multiple pods and so there's more of a delay until all parts of the restore have been obtained from all of the pods involved.)<p>If anything this maps pretty well to the expected usage pattern of an HDD in an external enclosure as many of them are used for infrequent backups rather than extending constant use storage. It's how I expect Backblaze will be hoping to get much more than the usual MTBF out of their drives they have purchased.<p>HDD guarantees may be time based, but HDD failure rates are linked much more closely with usage patterns; number of spin-ups/downs, number of seeks, number of sector writes, etc. A drive in constant use on a desktop machine is going to be hammered a lot more than one that's essentially written to just once (as the pod fills up) and then spun up every now and again for partial reads.",1349795889

Especially if nature takes its usual course where the natural seed slowly takes on the characteristics of the patented seed due to cross pollination. Which cannot be easily controlled in an open field unless Monsanto wants to crack down on all the insects involved in pollination.<p>Oh yes, make the wind illegal as well.<p>Based on articles I've read about Monsanto's behavior in this industry it seems they think they do indeed own the rights to soybean seeds in the US.<p>If the patent covered the process of creating said seed then I can understand. But I don't agree that one can claim to be unique and generic at the same time. Plus if the resulting seed is indistinguishable from a natural one and the patent was on the seed itself then it would seem that the natural seed is the prior art to counter the patent in the first place.<p>In your example, a proper comparison would be if the new organ is resistive to aging or whatever other common human failing that would cause one to replace the organ. Therefore, it is not indistinguishable from the natural one. It would indeed have a distinguishable characteristic that makes it different than a natural one. Then you can have the patent on the organ.

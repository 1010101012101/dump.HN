4424204,comment,4422871,4423381,8,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Before we pursue this metaphor too far, some observations about the National Electrical Code.<p>One is that software is <i>many orders of magnitude</i> more complex than an electrical delivery system. People have spent decades trying to figure out how to construct secure software by bolting together ""secure components"" in a simple way. Let's be charitable and just say: That work continues, and will continue throughout my lifetime. It's a much harder problem. Electricity is easy.<p>The other is that even the electrical code doesn't provide strong guarantees against malicious attacks by hostile humans. That's not in the spec. There's no armor on the wires that come into my house, no alarms that would go off if a ninja with a saw started cutting down a crucial utility pole in a DoS attack on my power, no formal procedures for screening the wiring in my walls for wiretapping devices. The electrical code doesn't even mandate a backup battery or generator, let alone that said generator should be tamper-proof.<p>Similarly, the fire code doesn't specify that my smoke detectors should have locks so that those ninjas can't easily remove the batteries before setting off a gasoline bomb in my living room late at night. There isn't even a gasoline-fume detector in my house. The windows aren't armored. This place is not defensible!<p>Of course, there are places in the world that are built at great expense to withstand attacks by armed bandits or trained spies. But if we wrote our building codes to incorporate such measures, what would happen is just what we see happening with software: People would line up to sign waivers and variances, so that they could just build a simple inexpensive house and get on with their lives.",1345748211

4424201,comment,4423171,4423533,2,0,jrl,,,"""It is also important to dispute the dissent's analogy to snapping a leaf from a tree. With respect, no one could contemplate that snapping a leaf from a tree would be worthy of a patent, whereas isolating genes to provide useful diagnostic tools and medicines is surely what the patent laws are intended to encourage and protect. Snapping a leaf from a tree is a physical separation, easily done by anyone. Creating a new chemical entity is the work of human transformation, requiring skill, knowledge, and effort.""<p>They're not creating a new chemical entity. The gene was created by evolution (natural selection, genetic drift, mutation) millions of years ago. The DNA sequence existed and performed its function long before any human began studying it. Furthermore, such information could already be found isolated in the form of mRNA, which contains the same information as the DNA gene (with the thymines replaced by uracils). Ultimately, what really matters for the function of the cell and even the diagnostic method is the information coded in the DNA, RNA, or protein. You are simply using a different alphabet to represent the same thing. And because the information was designed by nature, it shouldn't be patentable.<p>Nearly all experiments require you to modify what you're observing in order to measure it. That's why I feel the argument asserting that because you ""modify"" something makes it susceptible to patent protection is weak. If I combine water with some powder and sell it, I can patent the final product or maybe even the process to make it, but not the water. Water was present before I had the idea. BRCA1 was there before we had the idea of linking it to cancer, it's a substance just like water.<p>The troubling thing in this case is there's not even a modification involved. Cutting a DNA segment from the chromosome doesn't alter its sequence. In fact, separating DNA pieces happens routinely during recombination.<p>The problem is that they're not only protecting the diagnostic tool like the majority ruling says, they're claiming ownership of a chemical substance present in all humans that was invented by nature. I would support patenting the DNA sequencing method they used, but never the gene itself.",1345748170

Delaying that update by 3 weeks (due to the App Store process) is itself a form of sacrificing the user experience.<p>Or more likely, consider an example where Facebook is not sure which of 3 UI changes would most improve the user experience, and they want to serve each of the 3 to small subsets to collect test data. Native UI rendering takes away this ability, potentially reducing Facebook's ability to improve the user experience--also a form of sacrifice.<p>Now maybe you believe that the poor performance of the HTML5 UI was an even <i>greater</i> sacrifice than these, and thus the switch to the native UI is a net improvement in user experience. I happen to agree with that, but that doesn't mean there aren't tradeoffs.<p>Performance issues aside, the user experience of the Facebook mobile app is miles better now than it was when they last rendered the iOS UI natively. A big reason for that is the speed at which they iterate changes in the HTML5 UI.<p>Edit to add TL;DR: There is more to optimizing the user experience than maximizing UI performance.",1345748081

4424152,comment,4423171,4423377,11,0,anigbrowl,,,"I'm not sure you have understood the argument made by myriad here. Consider a parallel situation: crude oil is a product of nature, but getting it out of the ground and refining it into gasoline or other distillates involves a great deal of technology and ingenuity. If I invented a new way to refine oil into something that had the combustibility of gasoline but behaved differently - ignition at lower or higher temperatures, say, or that burned more cleanly - then my novel formulation would certainly be patentable.<p>Likewise, Myriad has been granted a patent on the isolated genes - their ability to produce DNA containing the two BRCA genes in quantity. The utility here is that if you're a medical researcher you can just order up this stuff for your research lab in a bottle, so to speak, instead of going through the tortuous business of isolating and purifying it in useful quantities. Now Myriad's competitors would like to do that too, and large research labs would like to do it for themselves. But Myriad has argued, successfully so far, that it invested all the effort and expense in learning how to do this reliably, and is entitled to recoup that investment by selling the product of all its research and development.<p>They didn't apply for a patent on the genes that lie within people's flesh and blood as part of their own DNA. They applied for a patent on the extracted, purified, and commoditized form of a single gene. If you could come up with a way to extract BRCA and BRCA-2 in a form that's useful to genetic researchers but employing a different process and final form from that of Myriad, then you wouldn't be infringing on their patent. Conversely, if you had spent a lot of money and time on the development of such a technology, wouldn't you be anxious to recoup that investment? It would be nice if they just gave it away, but then how are they going to pay their employees and attract future investors? What exactly are the economic incentives to expend all the effort and expense on developing an industrial process if one is not allowed to commercialize the result?",1345747715

Downloading the whitepaper from the Quantum web site, I see ""With data center construction costs running as high as $2,000 to $3,000 per square foot"", and the i6000 requires about 15 sq. ft. so that's a $30,000 up front which wasn't included in the estimate. Granted, that's only 5% more to the estimated tape costs, but it isn't the only real estate cost. I see estimates of about $2,000 per square foot for operations cost, so there's another $150,000.<p>It omitted any discussion of off-site backups. How much will that cost?<p>It ignores growth rate. Do you get the 5TB hardware solution now, when most of it isn't needed, or expand when needed? While with Glacier you just add data and don't worry about it. Assume you start with 1TB now, and grow by 0.8TB per year, to end with 5TB at the end of 5 years. That's almost a 2x reduction in price over the author's estimate.<p>But hey, that's all in the Amazon Glacier's front page: ""Companies typically over-pay for data archiving. First, they're forced to make an expensive upfront payment for their archiving solution (which does not include the ongoing cost for operational expenses such as power, facilities, staffing, and maintenance). Second, since companies have to guess what their capacity requirements will be, they understandably over-provision to make sure they have enough capacity for data redundancy and unexpected growth. This set of circumstances results in under-utilized capacity and wasted money. With Amazon Glacier, you pay only for what you use.""",1345747681

No body does so you see crosshatch pattern on them.

It's like distraction free mode in many editors and follows the iOS concept of one App at a time. Apple allows the developer to use all the monitors when in fullscreen the way they want in the app but less than 5% of the fullscreening apps actually do anything with the other monitor.

The company I was working for was out of money and couldn't find a serious outright buyer for numerous reasons, but worked out a deal with another company for that company to hire almost all of the previous company's employees and take over the building lease so we could continue working in the same building.<p>Virtually the whole company moved over -- a handful of people didn't get offers at the new place because their jobs didn't really make sense given the focus switch.  However, everyone who was offered a job save for one moved over to the new place.   The first sign of bad things to come was that nobody was offered a raise or any form of signing bonus, yet we still all accepted because the team was really great and we enjoyed working together.  The layer of engineering management inserted above us turned out to be incredibly horrible (the company came from a media background, not software), committing to developing software for a lot of sketchy platforms (eg. Yahoo Widgets running on Vizio TVs) but demanding full-featured rich AppleTV/GoogleTV-style apps, making content deals that didn't mesh well with technology needs, badly mismanaging the entire development process, putting people in positions based on politics and nepotism, etc.  Within ~5 months virtually the entire engineering (development and IT) staff from the old company, including me, had quit.<p>The story may yet have a happy ending, the CEO at the acquiring company (who was almost as new as our acquisition was) has since been cleaning house and trying to solve a lot of the problems that became glaringly obvious by all of the quitting and I wish him well because the product they are trying to build is a good one and I have friends who still work at the company.<p>tl;dr - this ""aquihire"" was terrible for me, but maybe indirectly helped the acquiring company realize how terrible it was before it was too late to fix it, so... partial success?",1345746967

The way our industry incentivizes ego, posture and dishonesty (and punishes the lack thereof) means that young Carmacks either find a rare lagoon, change fields - or get squashed into a different shape. Smart people can still do good work, but the required output is mostly other than technical, and knowledge takes a back seat.<p>This is what we are spending our lives on!<p>Finding like-minded people is not impossible, but like-minded workplaces hardly seem to exist. If you are not a Carmack-scale God to create your own lagoon, you literally can't afford just to be straight up about everything. You will fail every interview. That is why this is so rare and refreshing - it is rare because the environment heavily discourages it. Only some people need an ego-oriented environment - but everyone has to eat.<p>There is actually a parallel in science. People who start out deeply interested in truth and their subject have to exist in an environment which really isn't about those things. They either leave or learn to self-promote, inflate the sizes of their grants and chase fashion rather than bearing down on a particular subject in a disciplined way.<p>If this culture won't change then we need more lagoons.<p>In Feynman's words: ""So I have just one wish for you--the good luck to be somewhere where you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I have described, and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity.

My understanding is that many teams starting with TSP didn't have much of a process to begin with.<p>The good: PSP encourages a high level of developer responsibility for quality. So you use a checklist to review your code before running the unit tests. You record every defect you find and if applicable, use that information to make a better checklist. Every team has a TSP-trained Coach to guide the process, answer questions, and keep the team on track. The metrics generated from the process are analyzed weekly to see if the team is on target, if quality is where the predictions say it should be and if there are any roadblocks.<p>The bad: it can be a <i>major</i> change to how you are used to working. The data collection, while as automated as possible, is annoying. The constant emphasis on tracking time on various stages of fixing a bug/adding a feature adds a noticeable amount of friction to your workflow. While it's not Waterfall, TSP is definitely not Agile. Its entire focus is on predictability of output. It's an attempt to take what works well for Manufacturing and apply some of that to software dev.<p>In short, TSP/PSP is a good idea at heart for those types of development where initial product quality is critical or where you may never have a chance to fix a defect. This is not the case for most instances of modern software projects.",1345746581

If you're trying to get a track loud (making it sound drastically <i>better</i> in cars and on laptop speakers  a trade-off), you have to find a balance between distortion and compression. Badly done compression sounds way worse than a little clipping. Listen to Oasis's <i>Definitely Maybe</i> for an example of a CD that doesn't clip at all, but is virtually unlistenable because the dynamics were squashed out of it.<p>Short lengths of clipping (just a few samples) or clipping on drums can't usually be heard. The one thing that will always start sounding bad right away is clipped vocals, but that doesn't usually happen on professional recordings. These people know what they're doing.<p>If you open up all your favorite albums in a wave editor and rage everytime you see clipping, you'll be doing a lot of raging. But most of those sound engineers know their stuff and aren't being stupid. Worry about how it sounds, not how it looks.",1345746179

That's often the case at big publications; authors write reasonable pieces, and then editors slap crazy headlines on them to maximize views.<p>An Atlantic blog post that merely pondered the question of ""Why is Twitter willing to alienate new Tumblr users"" would obviously not drive as many views; people (rightly) don't expect random bloggers at The Atlantic to have a lot of insight into that question, and the only reason you'd want to read someone grappling with that question is if there was some promise that they'd have an answer.<p>The Atlantic's mostly poor coverage of technology issues is synecdochic of the decline of the whole publication in the wake of its pivot towards online journalism. They built a website with a pretty firm wall between The Atlantic Monthly and The Atlantic (Website), recruited some blog writers, and got some of their correspondants (Fallows, in particular) to write alongside them. Gradually, the blog writers seem to have swallowed the whole place, driving it towards Huffington-esque short-form provocations instead of essays and journalism; this mentality has infected the Monthly as well.<p>The same fate, of becoming a second-rate version of Slate with a reputation propped up by a second-rate version of The New Yorker, interestingly hasn't seemed to have befallen The New Yorker itself.",1345745849

I rather think that it's finding a different basis.  To take an analogy, monads and lambda calculus are like Fourier series.  For many classes of problems, they produce a cleaner, simpler understanding of the solution.  I'd hate to try and solve a boundary value problem with just Taylor series.  However, while expressing linear functions with Fourier series is possible, it's less clear than the Taylor series and you're more likely to mess it up.<p>In the same way, monads, arrows, and recursion are great ways of describing many classes of programs.  Additionally, they help with communication when your problem is a monad or an arrow.  However, certain classes of problems are better described under other paradigms than being forced into the functional one.<p>This comes back to Carmack's point.  It's important to know Haskell, since it's distilled computation down to a set of elements which are useful for describing a large class of problems.  Being able to communicate these solutions is important.  However, other paradigms are less error prone and do communicate solutions more clearly on other classes of problems.",1345745842

They are developing a great frontend and using others backends, but to really beat google or MS or yahoo you need to develop a great backend that can filter results well and troll the web efficiently then you can put an awesome frontend on it.<p>I still think the real silver bullet will be to make a backend system that can peer with other systems to gather data and can be customized to get deep results from a small subset of the web that interests a particular user ( think corporation uses it for internal search and to make their site show up better on a common front end).

The only real common ground is that refrigeration of food is required.<p>There isn't consensus in the language of the law, but there is consensus in the principles. Your example that refrigeration is required is an illustration of that point. Rather than focus on the details of the law, we can recognize that all food safety laws make some requirement related to the maintenance of temperature. Taken further, this is based on the principle that the available science is aware that food pathogens grow more rapidly at certain temperature ranges. There are many principles similar to this, upon which food safety laws are based, and these principles are the consensus.<p>The principle is what matters to this discussion, because that is what the laws will be based upon. I would expect that ""software safety"" laws will follow a similar tact. Even if I were to take the most cynical view possible, it doesn't seem plausible that legislators would attempt to write software safety laws for Java, C, C#.NET, Python, Ruby, Closure, etc, etc. Rather, they would attempt to establish principles, upon which process would be built.",1345745040

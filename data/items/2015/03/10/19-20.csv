9180228,comment,9179962,9180169,0,0,bbcbasic,,,"Following on from this, a good lesson I have learned is to try to work for profitable companies. You want the $ profit per employee to be as high as possible. I have worked for companies that struggled to make a profit, and guess what they underhire and underpay. I have worked for companies that make good profits and they hire just right and pay nice salary or bonuses.<p>The follow-on from this is to try to work for companies with good recurring revenue models that are efficiently run. Warning signs are companies that rely too much on one off big sales instead of a broad base of customers. Also another problem is consultancies who are hiring out your time and need you to be 100% billable.<p>The other warning sign is very small companies that are bootstrapping with tight owners who want to have lots of potential upside in the future by exploiting employees to make them do the work of many people in the early days while giving no little or no equity. Read up on HN and blogs about peoples experience with this, there is a lot written about it.",1426017598

It&#x27;s immoral some of the things many companies do in all legality, risk-free. You won&#x27;t stir up an internet shit storm for every one of them, even if you can get a few.

I really don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve gotten all that more moral.

9180194,comment,9178861,9178861,0,0,wongarsu,,,"I think using the polyfill as a baseline in the benchmark is misleading. Of course implementing SIMD is faster than emulating it in JavaScript, but nobody cares about that. What everyone is interested in is: How much faster is their SIMD implementation over a normal everyday non-SIMD implementation of the same algorithm. The whole article doesn&#x27;t even acknowledge that question.<p>Given that SIMD should bring about a 4 times speedup and yet the polyfill is 17 times slower than the Ion SIMD version and 40 times slower than the asm.js SIMD version, it seem likely that an implementation of the same algorithm without SIMD or polyfill would vastly outperform the polyfill too.",1426017240

9180192,comment,9178117,9178566,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Yes, it&#x27;s called pruning, it&#x27;s in development and not finished.<p>The basic idea is that bitcoins are actually units of money that are in your wallet. Rather bitcoin works by chaining transactions (put into blocks, hence the blockchain).<p>Thus if you give me $1, I don&#x27;t have $1, I actually have a record that you gave me $1 so that must mean I have $1 to spend. That&#x27;s the simplistic idea.<p>That is the reason why instead of storing account numbers with money numbers in them, bitcoin stores transactions.<p>By now it&#x27;s probably obvious to you that the vast majority of those transactions don&#x27;t need to be stored. If I give you $1 and you give it back, repeat 1 million times, we end up with exactly the same amount of money. And all but the last few transactions can be reasonable deleted. (pruning)<p>As for syncing, syncing up a wallet is much, much faster now that it&#x27;s headers first. But most users never sync, they either use 3rd party wallets like Coinbase, or they use wallet software that plugs into various nodes and APIs, so that no blockchain has to be present on-disk. The blockchain is really stored mostly by nodes, dedicated servers, businesses, a few enthusiasts.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean someone else manages the wallet by the way, like you mentioned for &#x27;consumer devices&#x27;, it just means that someone else manages the node. But the node doesn&#x27;t control your money, your private keys do, and those are just a few bytes of storage. And as there are thousands of nodes and many APIs, trust of nodes isn&#x27;t any different as when running your own node (which gets and sends data to other nodes, requiring the exact same amount of trust which is zero when it comes to controlling your money).<p>As for transaction fees being expensive, they&#x27;re extremely cheap? Pennies to send thousands or millions, and as it&#x27;s an open protocol anyone can build free centralized payment networks on top of it, like Changetip. Conversion with other currencies is also cheaper than most fiat conversions (e.g. dollar to euro), and in fact some companies already offer it for free (e.g. bitcoin/usd is completely free and pretty much instant with Circle, founded by Jeremy Allaire who founded Coldfusion).<p>The 15minute thing might be a deal-breaker for some. There are lots of solutions though that can remove that timer, built on top of bitcoin. Sidechains, treechains, payment channels etc. Anyway time will tell if these things work well but there don&#x27;t seem to be any dealbreakers yet on the horizon.",1426017233

That was the culture of rapid growth that gave MySQL its popularity and the developers are paying now the technical debt that has left so many features with poor testing behind. What Oracle is doing now is trying to redress that situation by strengthening the defaults, for which I commend them.

E.g. if they use AngularJS say you need a couple of days to learn it from tutorials etc.<p>If they are complete assholes about it and pressure you with &#x27;just get it done&#x27; &#x27;we need it done by end of day&#x27; &#x27;why is this taking so long&#x27; then maybe it is time to look elsewhere for a job.<p>In any case look at this job in terms of if it is good for your career (and more importantly, your mental health!) and if you thrive on high pressure fast learning or prefer to work for a bigger company that has the resources to give you more time.<p>Out of curiosity how many devs are working there? Is it one man and his dog, and you?",1426017070

But should updateable-ness really be the differentiating factor?  Now lets say that seL4 was compiled into VHDL to put in a fpga.  (I am using seL4 as an example because it is small and written in a functional language which would be easier to implement in hardware than a macrokernel written in a sequential language like C, and because it performs a significant function of a computer, even though it may be impracticable to implement in a hardware description language).  Is that hardware or software now?  I would say hardware, because it is now a collection of physical elements connected together.  But gnu.org&#x27;s definition only seems to care about the updateability-ness.<p>What if instead the seL4 code was on a rom that couldn&#x27;t be updated internally, but could instead be physically removed from a socket or unsoldered and replaced (even if not intended to be).  I&#x27;m not even sure whether this gnu.org definition would consider it hardware or software, but I would guess using the strict updateable-ness criterion alone, by having some manner to be replaced, it would be considered software.<p>Sometimes organizations choose definitions to provide realizable goals.  FSF uses this updateable-ness distinction, and then can for example say that the  libreboot X60 runs entirely free &quot;software&quot;.  But of course my libreboot X60 has a bunch of processors running un-updateable proprietary code, such as the wifi, disk, and graphics chips, even though they are interfacing to the cpu using open source drivers.  Also FSF seems to tolerate the preconfigured microcode already on the cpu, but won&#x27;t tolerate microcode updates loaded at boot.  But by using this non-updateable-ness criterion, FSF has a much more manageable but achievable conditions to meet the goal of free computing rather than having to &quot;free all the things&quot;.<p>Maybe FSF is attempting to find definitions relevant to libre-ness.  But I don&#x27;t think making up their own new definition of hardware and software is necessary for achieving goal of free computing, nor terribly useful.  I think they should just stick to the 4 freedoms (to run the program, to study how the program works, to redistribute copies, to improve the program) and might be better focusing on using the word &quot;program&quot; instead of having to make up their own new definitions for hardware and software.  The word &quot;program&quot; transcends the distinction between hardware and software.",1426016580

9179941,comment,9176586,9177563,0,0,karmacondon,,,"As usual, rayiner has answered these questions better than I can. Here is my take anyway:<p>1) The short version is that there is a difference between collecting information and looking at it. The NSA doesn&#x27;t look at or act upon any metadata it collects without first obtaining a warrant from a judge. It just sits there on a server until government lawyers can convince a judge that evidence shows that the data is relevant to a time sensitive security matter. You may not personally believe the government when they say that, or trust that they will always get a warrant to look at information that&#x27;s already in their possession. But, that&#x27;s the process. As of right now, the judicial system takes them at their word. That&#x27;s why the 4th amendment isn&#x27;t being violated. They still need a warrant.<p>2) Evidence collected via parallel construction is not withheld from the defendant, just the method of obtaining it. If the DEA says &quot;We have a tape of the accused discussing drug trafficking&quot;, that defense will be notified of that tape&#x27;s existence during discovery and will be able to hear it and prepare for it before trial. It&#x27;s just that the DEA won&#x27;t have to say exactly how they got the tape, as not to reveal the full extent of surveillance programs. This may or may not be an unfair advantage for the prosecution, depending on the details of the case. That&#x27;s why we have judges, who are in fact specialists at deciding what&#x27;s fair or not fair to present as evidence during a trial.<p>3) The Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches of government have all weighed in on these programs and approved them in some form. That&#x27;s the bottom line. You may disagree vehemently with their judgement, but this is how the American system of government works. If all three branches of the government agree that something is legal, then it&#x27;s legal.

It&#x27;s impossible to be &quot;weird&quot; anymore by simply having tattoos for example (at least where I live) because so many people have them that the presence or absence of ink is recognized as a completely ordinary variation, well within accepted social norms.<p>To be weird, something has to be outside of local social norms, and by definition such things call attention to themselves, each one using up 10 - 20% of other people&#x27;s extremely limited attentional resources (because we can only pay attention to 5 - 10 things at once.)<p>As such, budgeting your weirdness wisely is simply polite and pro-social.

It&#x27;s amazing if you want to just get a product out of the door. NoSQL is the short term answer. And MongoDB is the answer if writing your data to /dev/null feels like a good idea to you..<p>However, strong typing and regular databases offer consistency. You have no way of going wrong because it would have refused to compile twenty times before you even think about pushing your (wrong) code in production. Sure, you can force yourself to get such consistency in MongoDB. But first, it&#x27;s pretty taxing mentally, and secondly if you&#x27;re doing that, why not go the way of a relational DB which offer you tools to enforce that and is faster ?<p>KV columns in databases feel wrong to me too, I feel dirty using PGSQL&#x27;s json storage because I feel like I&#x27;m throwing normal forms away.

All of which were planned over years in some cases. There was no &quot;serious shit&quot; at any point in the process.<p>One popular reason for migrations is licensing costs (e.g. escaping Oracle or IBM), or due to mergers where the other company had a different database system and they wanted to consolidate both technology but also expertise.<p>> I&#x27;ll also guess you&#x27;ve never done it because the EF + MySQL = a world of pain.<p>I&#x27;ve never done what? I&#x27;ve never done EF with MySQL. I never claimed I did however.<p>I&#x27;ve used EF with other database systems including Oracle 11g, MS SQL (several), and other integrated it with some smaller database systems that had EF providers available.<p>> MySQL does not like nested queries, the EF uses them like they&#x27;re crack, one of the reasons the SQL it produces is so hard to read.<p>You, the developer, formulate the queries. If you&#x27;re seeing excess nesting then examine how you&#x27;re doing things.<p>> I&#x27;d guess that the EF + [any db that&#x27;s not MS SQL] probably suffers from similar &quot;holy shit why did the DB just die, oh it&#x27;s the EF&quot; problem.<p>That&#x27;s not been my experience. While I have found some other EF providers &quot;limited&quot; compared to Microsoft&#x27;s provider, most of the problems encountered were due to underlying bad configuration or bad entity layout rather than EF itself. I will say Code First is significantly better than EDMX-style modelling. In particular in larger projects (the Visual Studio designer kind of sucks).<p>> mainly because you have no idea what convoluted SQL it&#x27;s going to spit out.<p>It is very easy to see exactly what EF spits out. You can even pipe that output all over the place (e.g. error system, performance logs, etc). There&#x27;s no excuse for being ignorant of what EF is doing under the hood anymore.",1426014331

These have OO interfaces. According to you, these don&#x27;t exist, or are somehow not OO. It&#x27;s a purist attitude that does not fit reality.<p>You must know the performance characteristics of your API. OO says nothing about performance. Sure, it&#x27;s possible to have a random-access/list-like interface to a set of records ... on a file system, and assuming you&#x27;re willing to take the initial hit for indexing should you want to seek to the end. But this assumes you are working with a file, and not a tape drive, socket, pipe, keyboard or other interface.<p>It also assume that memory is infinite. You do not get a &quot;list of entries&quot;, you get an iterator (notice the &quot;-or&quot;!) of records. A reader doesn&#x27;t know if you have enough memory to provide a list. A list does, or it had to provide a lot of work to fake it.<p>If you don&#x27;t care about performance, memory constraints, latency, and other real-world factors then sure, your idealized world could do what you want.

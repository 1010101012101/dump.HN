He donated the funds to the school and while that may give him some authority in the program that shouldn't give him the rights to attempt to subliminally message students. Academic halls exist for freedom of information and that information shouldn't be pay to play. Talk to a department chair who works in that building and see what the deal really is.",1255867116

888265,comment,887743,887854,0,0,YorkSEO,,,"Yes plenty of companies request linkbuilding only, I'm not going to go into all the details of how we do it, but often its a case of contacting webmasters and asking them to link. Although there are certain techniques we use to increase our success rate which is where marketing aspects come in. In fact most good seo companies are really just online marketers, with seo being an umbrella term for a wide variety of techniques",1255866783

888255,comment,888117,888117,0,0,barrkel,,,"This is essentially the same feature that is exposed by MS in languages like C++, C# etc. as ""edit and continue"".<p>It's a feature I've never particularly liked, and never wanted to use to any strong degree. I have a strong suspicion that programming in this style is correlated with an aversion to strong typing, and actually amounts to a different way of thinking about programming. Not necessarily better, but different, and its effect on your productivity depends on how you prefer to work.",1255865893

I believe the Fed only serves as the lender of last resort.<p>The carry trade is nothing new either, it's often used for example when borrowing rates in other countries are favorable compared to rates on US treasuries.",1255865882
888253,comment,887743,888112,0,0,gaius,,,"The point is that there are only two ways to ""optimize"" your site: 1) hire a better designer and 2) game the ranking algorithms. The latter is what SEO ""experts"" do. From the search engine's perspective, they want their ranking to accurately match which site is most useful and relevant to their user. The ideal search engine, once things like location are discounted (a brilliantly designed site offering a useful service too far away from me is a bad search result) <i>is</i> going to rank on how good the site actually is.",1255865871

I'm tired of polls asking ""Do you agree with the racist decision by xxx?"" and 8-month old news recycled as a news video taking up the headline spot.<p>Anyone know of a good, real, hard-core news site?

The ratio size and complexity of the environment (fitness function, domain of the chromosomes, degree of mutation, etc...) compared to the size of each creature (i.e. how many possible chromosome possibilities there are) would have to be enormous to make a long experiment worthwhile.",1255865471

While I can imagine it's possible to send data across the audio port (modems anyone?), it seems like a more difficult route to take. Any idea's on why they would do that?",1255864305

GCC definitely performs this and I'm sure that it's true of other widely used C++ compilers.<p>I also don't know what yosefk means when he says that smart pointers rely on defective meta-programming techniques.

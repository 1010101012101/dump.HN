Also, your install should show some notification that it's complete. Currently, the install just disappears, making it tough to know if it even started.<p>Also, there is no background noise, so it's difficult to know if the program is working at all if nobody is talking (like in the HN room).<p>Furthermore, pushing the push-to-talk button causes behaviour I don't understand. The button pops up, then disappears again. What does that mean? Is it now on? I can't tell.<p>And finally, clicking the ""Add room"" button causes a strange message about the room that is not clear at all what it means. Am I now in multiple rooms? Do I own the room?

Larger, and easier on the eyes.<p>2)  Kindle UI is clunky here and there, but once you're reading a book it disappears.  Easier to turn pages on the Kindle than the iPhone (you get tired of swiping all the time on iPhone)<p>3)  I'm surprised how well the computer-voice readback feature sounds.  Probably useful in a car, or if you love audio-books.<p>4)  It's a poor-mans computer for browsing the internet.  The iPhone is miles better than that.<p>5)  Nice and light, good screen with light<p>6)  I'm going to read a lot more books now, I can already tell.  :)<p>.

.<p>===== DRM Issue =====<p>I did have an issue with one of my ebooks, ""Hackers and Painters"" no doubt, having a DRM issue getting this message:<p>""The selected item could not be opened""<p>The message said to go to Amazon.com and I'd find an answer on my ""Manage Your Kindle"" page.  Nothing there, unfortunately.  I emailed Amazon about the problem, but solved it before I got a response...<p>===Troubleshooting===<p>I tried deleting and re-downloading the book, and de-registering and re-registering the Kindle a couple of times with no luck.<p>===Solution===<p>Finally I figured it out.  I plugged the Kindle into my computer, deleted the Hackers and Painters ebook from the Documents folder on the Kindle (there were four files for the ebook), manually downloaded the ebook from Amazon's ""Manage Your Kindle"" page to my PC, and transferred the book onto the Kindle Documents folder via USB connection.<p>Sure enough that worked.<p>I bought this book on my iPhone initially, along with another one.  The other worked fine, Hackers and Painters didn't.  So my initial impression of the DRM is it's flaky.<p>The other two eBooks I've purchased haven't given me any trouble.",1236642802

509260,comment,508918,508918,0,0,rayvega,,,"The distinction between <i>functional</i> design and <i>technical</i> design is very important and often overlooked. Some developers tend to miss it or mix it up.<p>I have worked with programmers who felt they lost all control because they were not driving the functional design. However, they did truly have control, as Joel points out, because at the end of the day they still own and decide the technical design which is generally better aligned with their unique skills.<p>Good functional design tends to be technology ignorant by being more focused on <i>what</i> something is going to do from a user's perspective versus <i>how</i> it is going to do that something behind the scenes in code (as defined by the technical design).<p>While a functional design can be written out as a spec, the technical design can be developed and evolve as you write actual code if you follow an agile, iterative style of development. I think writing a technical spec (not to be confused with the functional spec) and handing it off to junior developers is why people get turned off by the idea of creating documentation on how something is going to work by someone who is not going to be the one actually implementing it. (In Joel's article, it is what Charles Simonyi was trying to define as program manager.)  Once again, this is not the same as someone who provides a functional design spec.<p>Alan Cooper's The Inmates Are Running the Asylum does a really good job drawing out and describing that distinction between the areas of functional vs technical design (although if I recall he uses different terminology to describe the two but the same concept nonetheless).",1236642347

It is just not possible to build a project that requires rights-of-way stretching over vast distances and needing planning horizons extending decades into the future without the government being involved, if only to settle the inevitable disputes.<p>I do find it amusing that Atlas Shrugged idolized the railroad barons and the industrialists who fed off them since in reality their businesses were completely dependent on government subsidies; and would not have been nearly as successful had the United States not been <i>GIVING</i> vast tracts of land to railroad companies to fund their expansion.<p>But leaving all of that sordid history and ideological self-delusion aside.

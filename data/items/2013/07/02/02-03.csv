Protocols keeps things open, into nodes not hubs.<p>- Applications/platforms provide easy comsumption, with a user design but also dependancies. It is like a menu to order, as you choose what you want to eat but you don&#x27;t have to care about how to do it (the recipe). They mutualize things as code librairies, CPU etc... but are hubs, not node and close the network in counterparty of user experience.<p>To see in depth the difference of design between a recipe and and a menu, more explanations in the Donald Norman book &quot; The Design of Everyday Things&quot;<p>Edit: To see the difference between a protocol and an application, why people are using Gmail instead of STMP? <i>User experience vs implementation</i>",1372733788

This in a town where one patrol cop, when interviewed during a ride-along by the local paper, stated that patrol is pretty boring in Redmond.<p>At first I thought that they got it cheap or free, but it still costs money.

In Western Europe you have brick houses, heavy double glazing, and the outer doors are solid wood or stretched metal, or one of the very heavy plastics reinforced with metal bars. The walls, nearly all of them, are concrete or brick. Security doors are reinforced concrete. Lately there has been a big push (by the police) to replace traditional locks with security locks and put locks and shutters on the windows, security doors, ... complete with tax breaks and a personal advisor (police would come down and do a security survey of your house if you wanted them to. They&#x27;d index all the entrances and exits, point out where there would be no visibility, tell you to have at least one locked barrier inside the house, ... Then give you the report, and I don&#x27;t think they even kept a copy. Not that it would help them that much to get in). Windows get double tax breaks : better security and better isolation.<p>The big problem they&#x27;re trying to protect against is power-tool equipped robbery gangs coming in from outside of the country, but within the EU.<p>Frankly, given the response to self-defense these days (intrusion = 1 year probation, hurting an intruder goes from 6 months to 10 years, but guaranteed not to be fully probation), you&#x27;re pretty much forced to do things this way, plus it&#x27;s a lot safer.<p>If the police wanted to kick down my door (previous owner installed a security door) ... they&#x27;d have to bring a tank, or heavy power tools, and it would take them 20-30 minutes to get in. SWAT teams exist of course, and they regularly get into that situation. Person locks himself in with drugs, and they need the entire afternoon to get past the door of the house.<p>Then you go visit America, and you see American houses. I&#x27;m not exactly fit anymore, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I could kick down one of those doors. The windows do not resist a light tap (average West European windows will easily resist a football getting kicked into them, good ones will resist a hammer, and when they do shatter, they shatter like plastic does, which still doesn&#x27;t give you access without 10 minutes of cleanup)<p>Always wondered why that is.

I say &quot;best&quot; in that there is consistent demand for websites and these are projects that are great to learn on. You could definitely start freelancing right now and charge $35 p/h. Just bill for 1/3 of your time as a previous poster mentioned & learn on the job - this is the most efficient way.<p>In your spare time (if any), I would highly recommend learning Javascript. Not Jquery - core Javascript. This will be incredibly useful when you do want to go to a startup. You will most likely be positioned as a front-end dev anyway, so focus on that. I have had to learn angularJS on the job and it&#x27;s been incredibly rewarding, yet I do wish that I had learned serious JS earlier (rather than just rolling WP themes).

I recommend it, it&#x27;s an eye opener. I got talked into letting a female friend do make-up on me, it was pretty much perfect (I basically dressed up as a girl that didn&#x27;t bother with a costume), and ta-daaa, at the carneval party of our school, which we did this, some older guy who worked there (super posh place), passing by behind me in a very crowded spot, grabbed my ass with BOTH hands, and so hard it very nearly hurt. But just for a split second, and before I could fully realize what had happened, much less turn around, he had moved on and when I finally did turn around I only saw his balding head disappear in the crowd (<i>of my schoolmates, none of whom had such big hands by a very long shot, before anyone tries to tell me something about a situation I experienced first hand that I didn&#x27;t know already, as seems to be tradition for some</i>).<p>I&#x27;m not proud that I actually laughed instead of running after him,  it was like he certified what great a job we had done (her mother was a professional make-up person, and she spent over an hour just on my face) -- but I wasn&#x27;t the 15 year old girl <i>he</i> thought I was, and other than that he knew exactly what he was doing, he attacked and moved away like a snake, there was nothing playful about this, nothing at all. I often thought back to this episode when growing up, and I vowed to never take any of this lightly. And even with the stuff others told me, first-hand experience, even as minor as this one, made a world of difference to me. It&#x27;s like seeing a world that was hidden from you for the first time -- <i>the stuff some men normally don&#x27;t do when I am around, because I am around</i>...! -- and it&#x27;s a shitty fucking world we should nuke from orbit.<p>So.... I see what the OP was being called creep for (not that they told us, just that the fact that they were called that means the word means nothing, heh), and raise you my little anecdote for what I would call <i>very</i> creepy.<p>You surely can see how &quot;Not everybody gets along with everybody&quot; is not really a good response here -- it kinda constitutes the default position of passivity, which is siding with the offender. And ignorance is not a defense when you&#x27;re not even <i>trying</i> to understand, but immediately prefer to talk stuff which is NOT the subject.<p>If little kids think it&#x27;s fine to wish rape on girls just because they&#x27;re owning them in Call of Duty, then personally, I don&#x27;t care if they&#x27;re rapists or butt grabbers in spe, they&#x27;re supporting something, unknowingly or recklessly or because they&#x27;re actually twisted, which fucking needs to go, period.

5975340,comment,5974509,5974509,8,0,jgon,,,"The reason it makes people angry is that &quot;creeper&quot; has become the male equivalent of slut shaming. I was thinking long and hard about this and it suddenly hit me.<p>1) It entirely a judgement in the head of the person making the claim.  There are no objective agreed upon standards for it, so there is no way to refute the claim. When someone calls another person a slut, they are using their own standards of sexuality, something about which there is no universal standard, and judging the person against that standard.  Because the standard is the accuser&#x27;s own there is no way to claim that they are objectively wrong.<p>2) Because of the above, it is entirely context dependent. As others have brought up, this means that the exact same behaviour from two different people can be called &quot;creepy&quot; in one instance, and desirable the next.  Examine the difference in reactions between  a person who does not fit the idealized marketing body type making themselves sexually avalable and a person considered &quot;hot&quot;. I have seen women called slutty for the same behaviour that was proclaimed as &quot;awesome&quot; all because they were seen as less conventionally attractive than the other woman.<p>3) It immediately associates that person with a negative societal perception and group. Because of this both words have incredible power, although much good work has been done to dull the impact of slut but it is still damaging.<p>Due to all of the above, calling someone a creeper is an incredibly powerful way to immediately disempower that person, place them on the defensive, and quickly impact them in a negative fashion.  We recognize that a combination of the above three points makes the word slut an incredibly negative word that should really never be used, and I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll get there with creeper/creepy.  But if you want to know why it makes people angry, well just remember that question the next time you get worked up over someone casually dropping a &quot;slut&quot; bomb on someone else.",1372731208

That goes with /any/ subject, not just this one. People that agree usually just hit &quot;like&quot; or move on.

There are of course exceptions, such as when the subject expects privacy (even in public, upskirts are no good), when you are making a profit from your photographs (which will then require model releases), or when ""national security"" is involved.  (ref <a href=""http://www.krages.com/phoright.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.krages.com/phoright.htm</a> )<p>In the UK it is approximately the same, with the addition that the subject may not be harassed (defined as behavior that causes alarm or distress over multiple incidents) (ref <a href=""http://www.sirimo.co.uk/2009/05/14/uk-photographers-rights-v2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sirimo.co.uk/2009/05/14/uk-photographers-rights-v...</a> )<p>I've found the relevant laws regarding photography in Canada (<a href=""http://ambientlight.ca/laws.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ambientlight.ca/laws.php</a>), and it seems to follow the US and UK in general.

Protectionism may (or may not) have helped specific industries in individual countries, but it was net harmful for medieval Europe, because nearly all international trade in medieval Europe was with other European countries.<p>It's a very interesting question how medieval Europe stopped being medieval.  The short version is peace and trade.  When society is dominated by local warlords, you tend to have neither.  Europe's rise out of medievalness was basically achieved by an alliance between medieval kings and a growing merchant class.  The kings used the wealth of the merchants to increase the power of the central goverment, which then protected the merchants from the random exactions of over-powerful nobles.",1250646026

You think I am one of those ""sacrifice liberty for a little security people""? Don't assume that's what I'm arguing for. As far as the cases in the article mentioned, yes. It's a controversial topic and I understand a lot of people have strong emotions over it. And the action these cops took might seem like it's leaning towards the <i>wiretapping</i> camp but it's not. I do think they were all guilty. There was a complaint and someone called the cops to help. They did.

No. So I don't even know why you brought that up.<p>I know what you're talking about though. If cops decided to target minority neighborhoods simply because minorities have a higher chance of criminal activity it would be a point of contention for me too. But that's not what the cops did in the article. They <i>answered</i> a cry for help. They <i>knew</i> there was problem in the area. And yes the last thing the cop did where she parked that car in front of that house was a little iffy, assuming she wasn't sure if a drug dealer actually lived there.",1250644424

It is a way of thinking and a way of life codified.<p>> I was wondering recently if it would be interesting to argue that forcibly teaching children a globally useless language for the sake of pleasing the adults who arbitrarily want it saved is a weak form of child abuse.<p>Actually, killing the language and the culture of a child because it is ""useless globally"" is cultural genocide.<p>And it has happened way too much.<p>Now for people conditioned to think that ""evolution"" should be applied to human matters, culture, this might not seem much.<p>But go read the experiences of smaller cultures oppressed and eliminated by ""global"" or local mightier forces, and you can plainly see it's a different kind of holocaust.<p>I want ways of life to change, die and whither organically, by their own cultural momentum. Not by ""global forces"" and market influence. And surely not by cultural imperialism.",1292997564

2030693,comment,2028984,2028984,0,0,ashearer,,,"John Gruber speculates that SEO-style titles don't work for SEO, and goes on to state that they're useless. This author reads a Google starter guide that says search engines read titles and that you should come up with good ones, and states ""I think it's safe to say"" that SEO-style titles actually do work.<p>There's little to no science happening here. It's amazing that despite search engines being such an important part of our lives, we still aren't sure about this basic question.<p>In a more ideal version of the world (that is, better for all of us except black-hat SEOs), Google's relevance and anti-gaming algorithms would be strong enough to withstand being opened up. But in reality, Google warns [1] that full knowledge would open the floodgates to search-engine spam, while the black-hat SEO industry already thrives on the meager number of flaws they stumble upon themselves.<p>So barring openness from the inside, the next best thing would be for scientific experiments to figure out what matters, attacking the problem from the outside. Though some SEO experts try to do this, many of their articles just retell folklore, or micro-analyze offhand gospel from Google employees, or run worthless experiments that end with the author reasserting a hunch. (To be fair, setting up a valid experiment is difficult. Algorithms change without notice, different data centers return different results, the rest of the Internet changes constantly, and there's no control Google. Physics, at least, runs the same from different locations.)<p>The best, most rigorous way I can think of to test hypotheses would be a set of carefully controlled pages with no outside competition (Googlewhacks). Something like this must have been tried before. If it has, can anyone point to it?<p>[1] <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/meaning-of-open.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/meaning-of-open.html</a>",1292997425

You can learn the science of programming along the way, but whats more important is showing yourself that you can do it.

However, if this thing hits the nightly news with an expose on how completely exposed we are to opt-in marketing and malicious apps that spy on us remotely through the camera or microphone -- it's going to kill Android for a good long time.<p>So, Google, let's fix this before it hits the evening news.",1292995534

I can say first-hand that governments and government contractors are constantly needing programmers that can talk to ArcGIS and properly visualize that information. This is true for any agency that needs to deal with official definitions of geography when calculating their statistics - I've seen law enforcement agencies, transportation agencies and housing agencies all need GIS applications developed, to name a few.

In other words, I agree with hugh3 that it may have been wise for them to do it this way.<p>I also think there's a certain elegance in delivering news that is actionable without news that isn't actionable. It's kind of like the [ANN] messages in user group mailing lists.<p>Sometimes I put on my action hat and am likely to see things as being action-related even when they aren't.

That fear went away once I started using version control, because I know that if I ever need the code, it's a rollback away.<p>The same goes for fiction.  I find it hard to discard ideas and whole pages of prose, because damnit, I worked hard on that, and the story might shift again in the future to require it.  If I'm using a word processor with revision history, I can just trust the computer to keep the old stuff, and if I ever need it again, I can pull it up.",1292994354

A more succinct version of Knuth's <i>""Programs are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute""</i><p><i>> the first makes my intent clearer than the second:</i><p>I really think the beauty of list comprehensions may be in the eye of the beholder.<p>I personally find the list comprehension syntax easier to read than equivalent map syntax most of the time, especially (as you point out) for cases where you want an anonymous function (ie quite often), but even for simple ones like your example.<p>Doubly so when you start chaining map & filter functionality to do one thing. Statements like <i>[ f(x) for x in xs if g(x) > 3 ]</i> seem to read quite nicely for me. You only need to change two words and you have a pseudocode description: <i>""f(x) for all x in xs where g(x) > 3""</i>.<p>This is obviously subjective, though, and maybe I'm in the minority. I knew list comprehensions before I knew Python, so I'll accept that makes me suspect.<p>(Edited for clarity)",1292994268

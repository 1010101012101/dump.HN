Given that the Internet is the creation of DARPA, indeed, was once called ""ARPAnet"", they're already up to their eyeballs. And to their credit, they've done an excellent job. I don't have citations handy, but I recall reading over the past year about many supposed ""cyber attacks"", yet for the most part, we all go about our business and surfing without even noticing that anything was going on.<p>The folks that designed the protocols on which this network runs (everything from ethernet through TCP/IP through DNS) did a phenomenal job. The network just may be the most robust thing ever engineered by man.<p>So perhaps they've already done their job. The front-loaded engineering gave us something that can withstand huge amounts of abuse, and so doesn't require an army (literally) to babysit it.",1274979421

First off, Apple isn't in the game of admitting that their products suck, and they certainly wouldn't encourage people to go out and buy PCs.<p>Secondly, Apple doesn't make that much money off app store sales, they make by far the most money off of the hardware. This includes (though with decreasing relevance) mac hardware sales. This may not discourage all that many mac purchases, but will it really increase iPhone purchases? It isn't like Apple is having a hard time getting apps on the store as it is, they are already dominating in terms of volume. Not to mention, this would be reaching out to a world of developers that Apple has spent the last decade insulting as being incapable of producing quality products, exactly the kind of ""crap"" the ""review"" process and 3.3.1 are designed to ""prevent"".<p>The only argument in the back of my mind that strikes me as particularly persuasive is that Apple is gearing up way ahead of anyone's predicted schedule to simply stop making macs altogether, at which point they would need a solid alternative development platform.",1274979059

While it might seem like a moot point to folks from other countries, we make a distinction about which agencies can do what and where. There needs to be some thinking about how an actual cyber war would happen. Would Air Force personnel physically take out internet backbones located inside the Continental U.S.? Would they serve search warrants? If not, would they direct the FBI to do so? Can they detain or investigate people?<p>We focus on the logical structure of a cyber-attack: computers, code, vectors, etc. But there a are a lot of physical components as well, and they can be located anywhere.<p>I completely agree that the AF is best of all the services to do this.

He had no idea what a uniform looked like or how to wear one, and it was quite an adventure making it all happen on time. All of the paperwork and procedures the Navy required made absolutely no sense to him -- so he had other people take care of it.<p>Now you can get away with this for a while in small isolated units where the rest of the organization can ""cover"" for them, but it's another thing entirely if 90% of the guys doing the work don't fit into the cookie-cutter mold they are supposed to.<p>An organization structured to hone young people into super responsible war-fighting roles, doing so in ways it has learned in wars since Sparta, is going to have a lot of problems with the people, personalities, and experiences necessary to fulfill this particular mission.

In my opinion, the fault lies with the business side. Lawyers provide a service - just like consultants. You wouldn't let a consultant run your business, so what's up with placing all the blaim on lawyers if deals get stuck? It's the business side's fault for not properly managing their lawyer and not telling him what exactly he is there for.<p>Legal education makes you an expert in spotting problems and helping put consensual agreements between people in enforceable language. It doesn't make you nit-picky per se, it's more a matter of character. There are first-hand lawyers out there who are probably even better at the business side than the business people themselves (think Peter Thiel) - they have an expert ability to spot lots of problems, and then proritize those and decide what's important and what not.

Tell them that within 5 years you will choose a winner based on returns.  You will soon be making over $400,000 a year in income, if not closer to $750,000 if you go aggressive.<p>At this rate you can fund a startup every 6 months as an angel.

I have seen parents push student to take Science then take Engineering/Medical school and then work in a company with nice salary, they want it or not. I often found it rather unnerving how my friends were pushed to top classes, my parents always pushed me to do what I love, but do it right. Sure I couldn't crack the most prestigious exams of the country but that is not the only way to get a good life is it?",1274976150

The problem is that your financial advisor's purpose is probably to make money, which he or she probably does most efficiently by separating you from yours through fees. A few minutes ago I recommended the book <i>The Millionaire Next Door</i>, which points out how fees can quickly kill your returns, which can't beat the market over time anyway.<p>You have a major principle-agent problem with financial advisers, and that's why I suspect many are better off without, especially if they can find an investment column in a newspaper or something like that. Years ago I read a guy named ""The Coffeehouse Investor,"" which helped me enormously, as did the books I recommended previously.",1274976125

That's the approach you use when developing Android apps with Eclipse ... Eclipse connects to a virtual emulated Android device.<p>I also think if this happens that Visual Studio would support Objective-C (and C/C++) instead of C#/Silverlight on the iPhone.  Microsoft would prefer the C# approach but Apple won't allow it.",1274976106

What if John Doe did a bootstrap startup with the intention to become the next Bezos, but instead ended up making $500k a year?

With iPhone development support, they could get new markets for Visual Studio.<p>Apple wins because (I hope I won't offend anyone with that) Visual Studio is just simply vastly superior to XCode. It is a truly great IDE (as opposed to Adobe Flash) that could make OS X / iPhone development an awful lot easier.",1274976002

You'd have to port all of the UIKit/CoreFoundation libraries over, you'd have to make a Windows version of the iPhone Simulator, you'd have to write a Objective-C compiler from scratch (remember, Microsoft would never ship GCC), that was <i>compatible</i> with GCC, the list goes on and on.<p>Now, maybe he's announcing a compatible version of Silverlight, or a way to compile SL applications to iPhone/iPad, which makes <i>far</i> more sense, and would be very compelling for developers. From one codebase, you could have a rich website, a desktop app, a WinPhone7 app, and an iPhone/iPad app, and you could write that app in C#, VB, Python or Ruby. <i>That'd</i> be awesome.",1274976001

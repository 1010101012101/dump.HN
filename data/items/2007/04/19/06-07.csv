Don't go higher, and don't give him twenty five grand or the pisant will just go buy more domains he won't use.<p>If you can't get it up front, go with the .com you own now.  I may be bitter and jaded, but I'm sure anyone who has ever tried to register a domain name feels the same way.  Domain squatters and ad spammers are lifeforms barely above spammers and slightly below the bacteria that grows in sewer sludge.  If you get enough success to let you be exploited into paying his ransom, he'll just raise it.<p>After all, it's now more valuable.  Get it now, get it cheap, or get another name.",1176965263
14503,comment,14485,14486,0,0,brett,,,"It seems pretty clear that you're right. What makes it hard to stomach though is that they're seriously on to something with S3 and EC2. Moral issues aside, should developers be wary of the poison spreading to the web services division that they've built their startups around?<p>It would make me feel better if the other shoe dropped and some other huge company released some competition for S3 and EC2 (I'm looking at you Google). That would provide some competitive protection from them screwing people over and another viable option. I would hope for a startup to fill the void, but this seems like as good a candidate as any for the type of problem where the big guys have some advantage. ",1176963468

In very plain language with in screen demo.<p>For a sample look at Mosoto:\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpuU4l_4Nr0&eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fmosoto%2Ecom%2F"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpuU4l_4Nr0&eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fmosoto%2Ecom%2F</a><p>You don't have to be anywhere near as crisp as these guys. If you can answer what's the problem and how juwo solves it in 2minutes you'll have fewer confused minds.",1176962885

14500,comment,14497,14497,0,0,ryan,,,"Here's a scenario: my co-founder and I are trying to finalize our company/website name.  We have two names right now, one we like slightly better than the other.<p>The problem is, the .com for the 'better' name is held by a squatter who wants $25k!  I hold the .net and .org.<p>The 'worse' domain is slightly longer (an extra syllable), and from my tests so far people find it a bit harder to pronounce.  The positive is I own the .com/.net/.org<p>So my question to the bright minds here: how hard do you think it is to brand a company with a .net domain (and potentially purchase the .com when we can afford it)?  I know some companies have done it.<p>Would you go with a slightly-better-name.net, or a slightly-worse-name.com?",1176962807

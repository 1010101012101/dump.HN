9018106,comment,9016669,9017958,0,0,cjf4,,,"I guess it&#x27;s a matter of taste as I greatly preferred Business Adventures to the Jobs biography. The Jobs book, while informative, felt like it was missing something. I got a better sense about the guy watching his old NEXT era PBS interviews than I did Isaacson&#x27;s bio, which too often felt like a recounting of major events shoehorned into what Isaacson decided the theme of Jobs&#x27; life was.<p>I&#x27;d still recommend reading BA because the writing style is first rate (and unexpectedly funny). It&#x27;s also worthwhile for the realization that, due to it&#x27;s mid century setting, that while the materials and ideas of the business world have changed since the books time, people really haven&#x27;t, thus business itself really hasn&#x27;t changed as much as you might otherwise conclude.",1423421940

My take on it is that the way people absorb information is unique to the individual and some presentations get through that filter and some don&#x27;t.<p>The other important thing I learned was that the filter changes, as you become more educated in a subject, you can pick up more with less if the author assumes you already know the basics. When writing for publication I sometimes felt I was explaining too much but my editor would dial that in for me, when I described to little she would gently prod me back to reality with &quot;How the hell is someone reading this supposed to know what that means?&quot; :-) When I went to far she would chastise me with &quot;Everyone already knows that.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve read Brooks, and in my opinion he writes for people who are already in the role of business leader and are trying to advance by not making the mistakes others have made. But is it brilliant? I don&#x27;t know. Can it be brilliant for Bill and Warren and not for anyone else? Probably. I found it useful but not as useful as Larry Bossidy&#x27;s &quot;Execution: the discipline of getting things done&quot; [1] which really helped me understand what &quot;progress&quot; was when you were a manager versus when you were an engineer and progress was &quot;obvious&quot; in the sense that the project got completed. But I can&#x27;t say that Execution is more brilliant than Business Stories, they are just different and one was better for me.<p>Bottom line don&#x27;t sweat it if you don&#x27;t see the brilliance, note it and move on. Later if you find you can recall what you read differently, based on your experience, consider going back and re-reading it. See if it has become more, or less, brilliant given your additional understanding.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Execution-Discipline-Getting-Things-Done-ebook/dp/B000Q9IR0A/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Execution-Discipline-Getting-Things-Do...</a>",1423421686

The job these tools exist to do necessarily means they can&#x27;t do better than what today&#x27;s browsers&#x27; JS engines will support.<p>Presumably in due course browsers will provide ES6 natively and so be better able to optimise code that uses tail calls in this way. Still, it&#x27;s important to realise that the 6to5 implementation is <i>much</i> slower, and more of a forward-compatible stepping stone if you need it than something to use routinely if you like a functional programming style.",1423421623
9018089,comment,9017719,9017877,0,0,jamesbrownuhh,,,"It&#x27;s a bit more complicated than that - as with all matters pertaining to agreed broadcast standards, the demo is sending data in the correct format but in a way which you would be unlikely to see in &#x27;normal&#x27; use, hence the code drives a truck load of edge cases through the various TV manufacturers&#x27; implementation of the spec, and some of them fall over and crash hard.<p>To explain it in a bit more detail:<p>Teletext works by sending 40-byte data packets in the unused screen lines of an analogue television signal known as the &#x27;vertical blanking interval&#x27; - basically a part of the TV signal where no picture is normally present, included only for timing purposes and to allow an old-style CRT monitor to drag the electron beam down from the bottom of the screen back up to the top again. (Oldskool console programmers will know all about this, also known as the flyback period.)<p>There are only so many usable screen lines in that period - say around 16. So the maximum number of data packets that can be sent via teletext is 16 packets per field, times 50 fields per second (PAL) = 800 packets.<p>A teletext page is usually 25 lines of these 40-byte data packets - although it&#x27;s not required to send every line, as a line that is not sent is assumed to be blank - quite common between paragraphs. This will become important later. But assume 27 packets per page, maybe a few more or less depending on page content.<p>That means a typical VBI period, at absolute top speed, can carry maybe 1.3 pages per frame. (A page is roughly 1K in size - 25x40 bytes, remember.)  So this is all pretty low speed stuff, and the TV manufacturers generally have plenty of time during the course of each picture field/frame to process these pages and do whatever they want to do.<p>Something else which will become important later - the transmission protocol of these pages is such that a page is only considered to have been completely received, when the next page (or indeed any other page) begins transmission. So for example, in some implementations, the process of starting a new page will trigger some software in the set to start assembling the packets that have been received to form the completed old page.<p>As I said, all pretty low speed. Nothing too taxing. So all the TV has to cope with, on a typical broadcast teletext service, is responding to a stream of packets along the lines of:<p>I am starting page 100. Here is line 1. Here is line 2. Here is line 3. Here is line 4. Here is line 5. Here is line 6. Here is line 7. (one fiftieth of a second goes by) Here is line 8. Here is line 9. Here is line 10. Here is line 11. Here is line 12. (another fiftieth of a second passes). Here is line 13. Here is line 15. Here is line 16. Here is line 17. Here is line 21. Here is line 22. Here is line 23. (Another fiftieth of a second passes). Here is line 24. I am starting page 101. Here is line 1... and so on.<p>Plenty of time to process all that, typically very low speed.  (I&#x27;ve only used eight lines per field there, to give a more realistic example of what a &#x27;real&#x27; teletext service transmits.)<p>So, clearly, a regular teletext service obviously takes a certain amount of time to transmit each page, which gives a regular teletext receiver a good amount of time to process it all. And teletext services in general don&#x27;t transmit blank pages. Not because they can&#x27;t or shouldn&#x27;t, but because there&#x27;s no point in doing so.<p>So here&#x27;s where it gets interesting. This proof-of-concept code is ONLY sending &#x27;here is a page&#x27; commands (also known as headers, or row zero packets) - and because no page content is being transmitted, that single &#x27;here is a page&#x27; command is all that is needed to describe a blank page.<p>TV sees &#x27;Here is page 100. Here is page 100. Here is page 100. Here is page 100. Here is page 100. Here is page 100. Here is page 100. Here is page 100...&#x27; and so on.<p>So if these pages are being interpreted by a TV&#x27;s code, rather than hard-wired hardware, suddenly it has a whole lot less time to process what it perceives as a completed page, than it had before. Where under normal conditions the TV would expect to be seeing maybe 10 or 20 pages per second, NOW every single line of the VBI is describing a new page, so it&#x27;s now seeing (e.g. 16 lines x 50 fields) = 800 pages every second.<p>If the software in the TV can&#x27;t turn all those pages around in a fraction of the time that it would normally have - something which it was almost certainly never designed to do, and never tested against - then soon the code has fallen on the floor with its pants down. There&#x27;s either a massive series of race conditions and collisions going on, or there&#x27;s a stack filling up and overflowing instantly, or whatever kind of showstopping fault can occur in a situation like this. In some TVs the decoding process will fail silently, in others there&#x27;ll be other effects, and in some the various watchdog processes in the set will eventually shut the TV off completely.<p>It&#x27;s a beautiful example from the olden days - your code might work against the generally accepted and agreed real-world usage of a specification, but can it stand up to legal inputs which &#x27;nobody would ever send&#x27; ?<p>And of course in a modern context, it does raise interesting possibilities - could you compromise a TV just by having it tune to a &#x27;specially crafted&#x27; video signal? It might not be as hard as you&#x27;d think.",1423421616

I think the fundamental misunderstanding a lot of people have, is that they use money as a value store. It is pretty crappy at that and that is by design. You are supposed to invest or consume with the money you earn, not leave it in your bank account or wallet, which is why what currency you use is more or less irrelevant as long as it is relatively stable and doesn&#x27;t devalue too fast.

9017978,comment,9017699,9017825,0,0,jarcane,,,"This is one of my favorite things about Racket: DrRacket itself is the language&#x27;s killer app.<p>Why? Because if I want to program in Racket, I install DrRacket, and then I run it, and now I am programming in Racket. When I want to run my program, I click run.<p>The end.<p>Whereas with basically every other language out there there is indeed a whole wall of bullshit in between me and just writing some goddamn code.<p>First I have to install the language. If I&#x27;m on Linux, this probably means installing a package from my distro&#x27;s package manager, unless of course I&#x27;m on Debian or something, in which case that&#x27;s the last thing I want to do because it&#x27;s probably out of date anyway, so I go hunting for an alternate package somewhere. If I&#x27;m on Windows, if I&#x27;m lucky there&#x27;s a standard installer and it goes without a hitch, except almost none of them ever set the path properly so now I have to dive down into the environment variables to make sure cmd.exe can actually find my compiler when I need it.<p>Next, I need an editor, because of the contemporary languages present, virtually none of them actually include one, and the ones that do are usually terrible. So now I have to find an editor or IDE I can stand, then whatever plugin I need for it to properly recognize my language syntax, and there&#x27;s a good chance the latter is only available for Emacs or Vim, neither of which are exactly a trivial learning curve.<p>So now I have my language, and I have my editor, and it&#x27;s time to start coding, right? Oh my no. Turns out I&#x27;ve picked one of the increasingly common languages that basically requires you to set up a package or project file before you can even start writing the bloody thing, so now I&#x27;m diving into making sense of Leiningen syntax or hunting for and then configuring Visual Studio templates, just so I can doodle out a quick script.<p>And now, if I&#x27;m lucky, I finally start coding! But now I&#x27;ve done some coding, and I want to actually run my program (hope you got your path set right!), which means I need to know what arcane series of compiler flags I have to pass in just to get the damn thing to run a file, and if anything goes wrong there&#x27;s always the chance that rather than being able to just click &quot;stop&quot; and halt the process, it will instead hang my entire system with a runaway thread because I typoed an if statement somewhere in one of my loops.<p>Compare all this to Racket: Download Racket, install Racket, run DrRacket from convenient shortcut or commandline, write code, run code. It&#x27;s the first language since QBasic that&#x27;s really got it right.",1423419572

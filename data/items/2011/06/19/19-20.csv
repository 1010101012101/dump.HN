The official CoffeeScript wiki on GitHub has some good content, but it's fairly scattered; no one has taken an intense interest in it. It's what happens when the main source of wiki contributions is people on an issue tracker saying ""Let's add this to the wiki."" A good wiki needs to have some organizing principle behind it, and the Cookbook's how-to ethos is clearly striking a chord with a lot of folks.<p>Of course, the Cookbook is only a few weeks old; its main page is a mixture of welcome and sorry-about-the-mess, and it still lacks a strong sense of focus. Some topics feel superfluous (""Converting Radians to Degrees"") while others are undercovered (only two short pages on jQuery?).<p>Also, I find it a little alarming that the first page listed on the TOC is ""Embedding JavaScript""I feel like the page should more or less just say, ""Don't do this!"" And what's with all the classical OO design patterns? (A bunch more are listed on the ""Wanted Recipes"" page.) Yes, CoffeeScript adds classes, but a lot of those design patterns are just plain unnecessary in the land of JS. Adding Java-esque boilerplate would be a huge step backwards.<p>Still, I'm optimistic. As CoffeeScript gains popularity, it's likely that the Cookbook will grow to become an important resource.",1308513229

When I asked a supervisor whether I should focus on Industrialization or Urbanization, or whether I would have enough time to take a detour to discuss the ""robber barons,"" I was told that it didn't matter what I taught them. It didn't matter if I never got to the Cold War, as was written in the curriculum map, and it didn't matter if we covered Vanderbilt but not Edison, or if I spent a week on the First World War but only a day on the Civil War.<p>""The only thing that matters is that you teach them how to write,"" she said.<p>You see, our school was being examined by the state (Connecticut), and our standardized test scores were low. History teachers were openly referred to as ""secondary english teachers,"" and our purpose was to teach children to write essays with thesis sentences. Every week, we were to devote class time to writing lessons, go over things such as topic sentences, conclusion paragraphs, editing, grammar, etc. Never mind that the kids have nothing to write about, nothing to say, because they haven't actually engaged with the world in any meaningful way. They could have been writing VCR instruction manuals.<p>History isn't tested on standardized tests. It isn't tested because no one cares. Writing is important because it gets you a job. History never gets anyone a higher salary (with the possible exception of history teachers), and so who gives a shit?<p>You have no idea how demoralizing it was to see the subject I love, that I passionately believe in, degraded in this way. Who cares what you teach? It's all a bunch of useless bullshit anyway, right?<p>Our problem with history is a symptom of our problem with education, which is that we don't know what it's for. We don't know, or can't decide, why we still adhere to the classical, liberal form of education. When little Joan or Sam or Miguel looks up at us and asks why he has to learn about Thomas Edison, the administrators of our school systems have no idea what to tell them. They don't say that the world is more interesting, more vivid, more meaningful, when you understand how it works. They don't say that we only understand ourselves when we understand where we come from. They don't say that much of popular culture has roots in historical precedents, and that understanding historical references opens up a whole new level of cultural understanding. They don't say that all Americans have a civic duty to understand their own past, and they don't say that understanding the past is the only way to avoid repeating our worst atrocities.<p>They say that it will all help them get a good job.<p>And that's total bullshit, and the kids know it.",1308513023

I do some contract work (when not working on my startup :)) and I can remember creating my first proposal from scratch and being somewhat overwhelmed. Not because anything in particular was all that difficult, just that there were lots of details that needed to get right, and then it needed to be formatted and professional looking. The second proposal was a million times easier b/c I had the first as a reference.<p>Some constructive criticism based on my first visit to the site:<p>- I really wanted to see an example final proposal, right away. I never did find one. I guess you have to sign up to see one? That seems like expecting too much from someone who doesn't know if they want to use your service yet.<p>- I didn't get what the 'negotiation' features where about. The site mentions the ability to get parts of the proposal approved or discussed with a client, but I think you need to describe that a bit more up front. I'm hesistant to ask a client to do very much work to give me a contract, so I'd need to know exactly what the client would need to do to use that feature. Sure, I could figure it out by signing up and playing with that feature, but I'd rather you just tell me.

I want to give it a try, but don't want to postpone my studies anymore. I decided I'll give this idea a chance.<p>To my understanding building a start-up and pursuing this dream can take forever, that's why unless I give it a final deadline I believe that I won't study at all.

That semester I got all As though, doing the bare minimum, which I suppose for myself was more than the maximum others were doing.<p>Someone like yourself is naturally intellectually curious and likes to create things and explore. The structure of college is not really necessary especially with a technical degree. Engineering programs tend to have reduced general ed/humanities requirements anyway. For something like a classics background, perhaps college is really beneficial. For engineering, nearly everything was things I already knew about since I'd been making things and reading tech journals since adolescence. As to the professors, very few had any life experience designing working software used by other people. Most professors simply don't know very much about design, creating things, or running a business. Most have lived sheltered lives, straight to teaching from grad school. If I was studying Russian literature I would not be impressed by a professor who could not read Russian and had not read any Russian literature.

It's not just prophets though, it's most things. New town, new start, new person. It's interesting that college allows you free time and space to succeed, completely aside from the classes.

These aren't random permutations you test, they're new tweaks to a design that you suspect might help.<p>Sure, changing the font may be meaningless, but at least with a test, you KNOW it's meaningless.  I try to let experience and taste guide my changes, but without checking that the change is effective you're just guessing.<p>Design exists to further a goal.

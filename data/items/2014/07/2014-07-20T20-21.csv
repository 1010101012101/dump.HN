In general, there is a lot of money to be made in China selling the level of sophistication common in the West but doing it in a way that&#x27;s culturally acceptable to the Chinese.  If you&#x27;re interested, check out James Fallows&#x27; &quot;China Airborne&quot;.  It&#x27;s about the nascent airline industry in China but it&#x27;s a bellwether for other nascent sophisticated industries in China.  For example, when Boeing needed to get China to follow the same strict practices that the US airlines do, they had to tell the Chinese that they need to meet the &quot;international&quot; standards.  While it is true the standards are international, what Boeing didn&#x27;t mention is that the US pretty much wrote those standards.  The Chinese find it a lot easier to accept that it&#x27;s an international standard everyone has to follow instead of an American standard.",1405889997

8061478,comment,8060356,8060356,5,0,skierscott,,,"I&#x27;m an undergrad in a lab that focuses on compressed sensing (and we&#x27;re getting more into sparse machine learning).<p>Sparsity is a way of saying that most of the data you collect is related in some way. One advantage of sparsity (and there are many more) is sampling at sub-Nyquist rates[0] and still being able reconstruct the signal precisely. Why? Because the signal is sparse in the Fourier domain -- there are only a few frequencies present in the signal.<p>Reading this article, I had some issues with this quote:<p>>  According to Candes, you could take half the samples (16) and rerun the test. If it is positive, the infected person is in this group; if negative, the culprit is in the other half. You can continue to whittle down the possibilities by once again dividing the group in half and running the test again.<p>That&#x27;s just a simple binary search[1]. Instead, why not collect other information? Collect some genetic information, lifestyle habits, living location, etc. Then I believe (that&#x27;s a strong I believe) you could optimize even further by testing patients that have some of these traits in common -- you&#x27;d have groups of unequal sizes based on who you think has the disease. This corresponds to sparsity. Most traits don&#x27;t matter but a select few do.<p>To see real-world results of sparsity, we&#x27;re able to reconstruct precise approximations after we assume our input is sparse in the wavelet basis (corresponding to many areas of the same color). We&#x27;re able to push this sampling rate down to ~6% for simple images by doing a &quot;sample, compute&quot; method. The reconstructed approximation and sampled locations are shown in this image[2]<p>[0]:<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search</a><p>[1]:<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_rate</a><p>[2]:<a href=""http://imgur.com/PmYpze6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/PmYpze6</a>",1405889718

Most startups fail so at a typical startup, there is no upside for employees <i>or</i> founders. Funding, however, is plentiful and most of that funding is directed to employee salaries. So who is benefiting the most at the average startup? The engineers paid well into the six-figures to work on modest CRUD apps regardless of said app&#x27;s ability to drive sufficient revenue to sustain a real business.<p>In other parts of the post the author suggests that engineers (and other non-founders) aren&#x27;t compensated appropriately, but his argument isn&#x27;t convincing. Lots of early stage startups (perhaps the majority) don&#x27;t generate enough cash to fund operations and many won&#x27;t any time soon if ever. Just how much should folks be paid at a company that, without investment dollars, wouldn&#x27;t be able to make payroll?<p>> There is a reason it is hard to hire in Silicon Valley today, and it isn’t just that there are a lot of startups. It’s because engineers and other creators are realizing that the cards are stacked against them unless they are the ones in charge.<p>There are <i>a lot</i> of reasons companies find it hard to hire in Silicon Valley today. They&#x27;re too picky and/or focused on &quot;culture.&quot; They can&#x27;t pay market salary. Lots of companies are uninspiring and thus unattractive. Many startups fail at retention. Not everyone wants to work at a startup or live in an area with a high cost of living. And so on and so forth.<p>Absent hard numbers to back up the claim, the author fails to present evidence is there that there isn&#x27;t enough talent primarily because individuals are leaving the labor force to start their own companies.<p>> Founders are not normal people in any of the ways that matter of course. For them, the benefits of building a business are many-fold. They can connect with journalists, advisors, mentors, new business partners, and most importantly, investors...<p>Note how the author left out &quot;customers.&quot; Interestingly, the word doesn&#x27;t appear anywhere in this article, nor do the words &quot;sales&quot;, &quot;revenue&quot;, &quot;cashflow&quot; or &quot;profit.&quot; For a post that does an awful lot of complaining about how the fruits of startup success are divvied up, I think it&#x27;s telling that the author completely ignored the things that make a company successful.",1405889628

If you think the &quot;bar is so much lower&quot; to becoming a founder then stop whining about being one of the forgotten early employees and get off your ass and start a company for the right reasons: finding a market opportunity and making money from it. If you can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t, then you can&#x27;t expect the rewards.<p>Early employees are important, and should be given credit and fair payment for their work, but their risk profile is far, far less than the founders and investors. Investors stand to lose their investment (which is an accumulation of work) and the founders can lose money, reputation, and time.

Now compile a list of the first 10 - 100 employees. Now take the net worth for those individuals and compare it to the rest of the world. You&#x27;ll find it lands north of the 99th percentile.<p>You can pull out exceptions of course, the sales guy at Sun who was worth several million and lost it all through a series of really poor choices, the Googler who left 6 months in rather than vest that first tranche of stock, the Apple employee who gave up their shares to live a simpler life. But for the most part all of those people have a net worth north of $1M. Ask Charlie Ayers, the original chef at Google if he is mad/bitter/whatever because Larry and Sergey are billionaires and he is just a multimillionaire.<p>The narrative that founders win and everyone else loses is wrong. You&#x27;ve heard about the abominable failure rate of startups 9 in 10 fail. An employee can get a piece of 10 different startups in 10 years if they move from place to place, vest their 25% of their option and exercise it. A founder is lucky if they get 3 shots at the prize in 10 years. Do the employees who are driving around matching Ferrari&#x27;s in the Facebook parking lot feel bad that Zuckerberg is worth a lot more than they are? Most of them no, they don&#x27;t care, they are &quot;rich&quot;.<p>Do founders get the &#x27;fame&#x27; ? Sure, is that a good thing or a bad thing? Sometimes it makes you a target.

I stayed at one of my co-workers places for the last three weeks. He had a computer which he used to monitor the stock market, I helped him enter data into it (which at the time there was no Internet). One evening having just gone through a list of number/value pairs (qty and price) I multiplied them all out in my head and summed them, the result was over $2M. I asked him if that was his savings and he said &quot;yup&quot;. I couldn&#x27;t believe this guy who lived in the same tract house he had been living in for years was a millionaire. Where was the fancy car? the lavish furnishings? None of that. I asked him what it was like, he said, &quot;I worry less about the future than I did before.&quot;<p>My point is that the ecosystem that is Silicon valley creates a lot of those kinds of people.

To compare, Uber is allowed to charge 3x the normal price during peak hours, whereas NYC cabs have a fixed 50 cent surcharge at night and $1 during evening commuting hours.<p>Personal anecdote: requested an Uber at the ferry terminal on the embarcadero 20 minutes before a surge.  Driver was a block away and suddenly canceled, forcing me to request again.  The second request occurred during a surge, so I had to pay 2.5x for that trip!  Fortunately Uber refunded me but that type of stunt is what the laws exist to prevent.<p>As I understand UberX, since the drivers are not required to take on commercial insurance, their insurance costs are also significantly limited.  The biggest botheration, though, is the fact that the insurance policies technically don&#x27;t allow driving for hire.<p>It seems we all want a situation with the regulations, guarantees and protections that are currently provided by the laws AND the convenience and benefits of Uber.  Unfortunately they are mutually exclusive.  If we allowed taxis to charge more for fares and to skirt the other regulations that they are currently bound to, I&#x27;d expect that the taxi landscape would improve immensely",1405888709

Pretty much all of the authoritative name servers (Bind, NSD, Windows, Knot) have made the signing service a few lines in a configuration file. YES, there are operational steps you need to put in place, primarily related to KSK rollovers, but the actual deployment is pretty simple these days.<p>Similarly, on the validation side, deploying DNSSEC validation is basically one line in a config file for BIND and Unbound and a little bit more in Windows Server 2012.  It&#x27;s simple to deploy.<p>> * It sucks up all the oxygen from the effort to actually mitigate flaws in the DNS. The most important DNS security flaw is the last-mile problem between browsers and nameservers<p>That may be the most important issue to YOU, but to others ensuring the integrity of the DNS info is more important.<p>> * It provides a setting for us to transition the CA system from untrustworthy companies directly to world governments<p>Huh? I keep hearing DNSSEC critics bring this up and I&#x27;ve yet to have anyone truly explain how this can happen.<p>> * Any way you try to project the math out, it will be ludicrously expensive to deploy (the deployment numbers we see today are, effectively, trial/pilot deployments, since virtually no end-user software cares about DNSSEC).<p>There are 18 million customers of Comcast in North America who are receiving the integrity protection of DNSSEC.

As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend to be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would prefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million, while the VCs can afford to be &quot;rational&quot; and prefer the latter.&quot;",1405886964

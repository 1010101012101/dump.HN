Keep your demo/beta or whatever running, and if people start using it, you'll see that and can move back to it. Further investment is all you should worry about.",1181073488
26498,comment,26237,26478,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I'm curious - if individual founders write a significant amount of code before incorporation, do they then have to legally sign over rights to the code to the corporation once it's been formed?  Are there persistent legal problems that might arise from working first and incorporating later, or can everything be solved by a good lawyer?  (Assuming a good working relationship between cofounders...if there's no legal framework and then things get sour, I'd imagine there're lots of problems that might arise...)",1181072680

Truemors is more derivative than most, so using it as a barometer for how much it takes to launch a startup isn't completely accurate.",1181072165

Seriously, everything interesting and truly remarkable was built in ""Web 1.0"" days: online search, online directions, blogs (yes, they are a lot older than most think :-), you name it - everything was built or <i>invented</i> back in late 90s.<p>With Web 2.0 people talk alot about:\n- Using code that you did not write (god bless open source)\n- ... and never spend a dime on (or contributing to) it\n- Never worry about actual content/service\n- ... and never pay a dime for content (let customers do it for you!)<p>so... basically Web 2.0 is largely about <i>not</i> creating anything, but rather finding ways of capitalizing on what others have done.<p>Do I sound to pessimistic? :-) Did I forget about AJAX? :-) But <i>AJAX is just one function call</i> and it's been innovated by Microsoft wa-a-a-ay back in Web 1.0 days.\n",1181070967

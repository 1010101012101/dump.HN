Just like the MacBook finally shook up the &quot;ugly grex box&quot; status quo of laptops the new MacBook Pro finally shakes up the &quot;big ugly grey box&quot; status quo of workstation computers. I am curious how many watts/m^3/dB will Apple be able to pack with this approach, it seems to a be a very interesting direction.",1371902345
5923300,comment,5923114,5923175,5,0,pmjordan,,,"<i>The Mac pro only has one CPU because that&#x27;s all they could fit in.</i><p>I suspect the real reason is that Apple still {can&#x27;t be bothered|can&#x27;t figure out how} to add NUMA support to OS X. The existing 2-socket Mac Pros have been crippled by the interleaved-mode NUMA. (which, interestingly enough, is even hardcoded in the firmware, so when running OSes that support NUMA on a Mac Pro, you can&#x27;t benefit from that support, presumably so the benchmarks don&#x27;t shine a bad light on OS X - of course it&#x27;s blindingly obvious when compared to a same-spec workstation from HP, Dell, etc.)<p>In fairness, adding NUMA to xnu is probably quite an undertaking. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they&#x27;ve previously tried and got in a terrible mess. The task/thread management is scattered across the Mach and BSD subsystems, and the virtual memory system handles some conditions (such as low memory) terribly, and seems to scale badly to large amounts of RAM and 64 bits.",1371902344

But that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;d be impossible.<p>Regarding oldskool sabotage, those aren&#x27;t quite reliable to produce freak accidents. Too much chance and user behavior involved.<p>Regarding breaking: Anti-blocking systems can release the breaks all by themselves. They do this by computer input issued after evaluating the sensors for each wheel when they&#x27;re working. If hacked, they could do this on pretty much any condition.<p>Regarding steering: assisted steering uses an acctuator to amplify your input. This can be circumvented to steer by itself. Self parking systems make use of this, there&#x27;s no separate system to make the steering wheel turn for self parking, it reuses the mechanics of assisted steering to do the job.",1371902285

If so...<p>I find it very, very hard to believe a modern Mercedes would do that. Merc are very safety conscious, they sell to well off people who expect not to blow up, and that is on top of strict EU safety rules and testing. I assume the US also has it&#x27;s standards to comply with too. This is a luxury car manufacturer which prides its self on safety above and beyond legislation or international standards, and sells to customer who fully expect that.<p>So, is there no public Merc statement or full on internal investigation? A Merc blowing up like that publicly should be a massive PR disaster for them. Who wants a luxury car that blows up in a front impact? If it is as simple as a front impact causing the car to blow up, I would have thought Merc would be very, publicly, concerned about that.<p>If I were some one interested in investigating this, I&#x27;d be perusing Mercedes to see what they have to say.",1371900693

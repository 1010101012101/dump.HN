You can choose to make your life easier or your users experience nicer.<p>Personally, my strategy is simply to not write HTML or CSS.  I write to a DSL that is implemented based on what browser is being served, so there are no sniffer scripts in the pages themselves.

1032107,comment,1031950,1032019,0,0,pavs,,,"While generally I agree with you. New type of software/hardware tends to reach a point where subsequent improvements doesn't add _huge_ value to end users. Which is when I think it is a perfect time to buy a new technology. Some example I can think of is:<p>Iphone Original and 3g. The original was good but with 3G Apple reached a point of equilibrium where it is safe to say that waiting 6 months to a year for the next iphone won't give you hugely superior product. (Maybe a free firmware update to a better software)<p>But ereader market is not very matured, until recently it was dominated by sony, who didn't care much about innovation - because there was no major competition. With big players like Amazon - B&N - Apple entering the market, just now, it will initiate some major changes/improvements in a very short time. Which is why the perfect time to buy an e-reader in my opinion is at the end of this year.<p>Personally I read a lot on my macbook, which  I think is a great indoor reading device.",1262681493

The game wasn't skill based - it was <i>story</i> based.  Sure I can ramp up the difficulty now and try and solo it - but the main reason for playing it is to explore the world and to follow the story.  In some ways it's more of an interactive movie than a game (albeit a 60 hour movie).  The reward in a game like this is not the playing - it's the world/story/vibe.

However, in UK there is a standard form for direct debits which says ""If an error is made by <the company> or your Bank or Building Society, you are guaranteed a full and immediate refund from your branch of the amount paid."" which puts the responsibility on the local branch directly and doesn't allow a refund to wait till some random day in the future (so closing the direct debit should work the way people from the article wanted).

1032086,comment,1031922,1031984,0,0,timr,,,"Eh...you're confusing antibiotic resistance with the fact that alcohol-based sanitizers aren't 100% effective.  There are two different things going on here:<p>1) Most anti-microbials aren't antibiotics.  They're compounds that happen to kill bacteria by smacking them with the chemical equivalent of a sledgehammer, preventing them from sticking to things, or some other, broad-spectrum mechanism (i.e. they don't generally work by blocking an ion channel or targeting a specific protein or pathway, as would an antibiotic).<p>2) Hand sanitizers are a special case of #1, where the vast majority are simply alcohol-based gels.  Effectiveness of these is determined by concentration and time of exposure (the longer, the better), and in real life, people don't leave them on long enough to be 100% effective.<p>For the most part, anti-microbial treatment is broad-spectrum, meaning there's no single thing that an organism can do to escape damage.  Membranes are dissolved, cells are dessicated, proteins are denatured.  Saying that a bacterium could evolve resistance to this is a bit like saying that if you dropped a car on a group of people, the survivors of the catastrophe would be more fit to survive future car-droppings.  It's hard for a bacterium to evolve a protective mechanism against having its membrane proteins denatured, or having all of its critical energetic pathways blocked.  The damage is simply too extensive.",1262679648

Or what if I did find the critical bug, but had to wait weeks for forms before it was pushed through?  Or was blocked by office politics?<p>There's nothing more disheartening as having a fix for something serious that you can't push through.  I've worked at companies like that: taking away the power to break something means taking away the power to make it better.<p>Not to say that I somehow dislike code reviews or generally fly by the seat of my pants:  the situation really was a real emergency.

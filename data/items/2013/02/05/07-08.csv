5169676,comment,5168711,5169648,2,0,lutusp,,,"> It's a valid question.<p>Not really. Releasing secrets to the media counts as giving it to the enemy. Wikileaks was just a middleman, sort of like a hit man or a bag-man -- one can still hold the originator responsible.<p>I'm not taking a position on this case, only the logic you're using.<p>When Geraldo Rivera was in Iraq, attached to a combat unit, he went on the air and revealed his unit's future plans and location in far too specific terms. He was immediately expelled from the country on the same grounds -- giving information to the enemy -- even though he just broadcast the information, without any specific recipient in mind. Just like Manning.<p><a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/31/sprj.irq.rivera/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/31/sprj.irq.rivera/</a>",1360051043

People use the term ""democracy"" constantly, so figuring out what it means (and what they mean by it) matters. So just ignoring it, as you suggest, is not a viable option at all.<p>From reading [1], you will pick up that I think we should define these terms by their essence, not (say) how closely some specific historical cases did or did not approach the ideal.<p>Moreover, it's been intellectually important for progressives to insist that the US is a democracy since the progressive movement began (1900s or thereabout), because democracy is necessary to implement their ideas. I'm not saying it was a grand conspiracy.

5169661,comment,5168711,5169516,1,0,mc32,,,"I think one of the main reasons is that they, AQ, are 'outlaws'  they operate outside the laws of places they operate from and most of their operational bases are in places which are too weak to locally deal with AQ in a more traditional method.  So because they are outside the law construct (of extradition, reach of local enforcement, local complicity, etc.), they, almost by necessity require this approach -which some people question and some approve of.<p>It's an an answer to the question, how does one deal with an entity which does not subject itself to a set of groundrules one expects/operates in.  In this case, you meet them half way (in vernacular terms, that's a good deal) for the offender (since their, AQ's, whole existence is predicated on vanquishing Kafirs).<p>The alternatives are you meet them in their terms adopting their groundrules for dealing with you (this is a strong position to work from), another is you deal with them as you deal with other entities with whom you have structured relationships (this is a weak position to work from) since they would not likely reciprocate.<p>A tax evader, you attempt to extradite, if you have agreements, if not, you try to get them when they make a mistake (fly into a place with a treaty).  But when a nation is concerned with national security, there is less pussyfooting and more serious action, where possible.  (i.e if AQ were based in China, the approach would require some rethinking or at least some negotiation with the host country.)",1360050586

One thing they share is the idea that, unless their critics can disprove their beliefs, the beliefs must have merit. In other words, they hold the opposite of the null hypothesis (the idea that an idea with no evidence is probably false) -- they also unfairly shift onto others their own burden of evidence.<p>> The funny thing is these people are otherwise quite intelligent and capable of rational thought.<p>Intelligence is no assurance of reasonable thought processes.

For instance, let's say I put $10,000 down on a house in 2007 that's worth $500,000. Is that house really worth $500,000, or is that valuation a side effect of easy lending? I guess it depends on when you calculate that worth.<p>But take 5 companies that have a combined valuation of $5 billion according to their last round.  My point is simply this: those companies together are not actually worth 5 billion dollars, in that you cannot find someone to buy them at that price.  You can sell portions, sure.  But you end up with less than the 5 billion quoted in NYT.<p>But as pg points out, in practice, nobody is trying to buy companies that way, and there are many other factors at work.

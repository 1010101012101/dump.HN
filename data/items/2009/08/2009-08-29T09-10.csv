A strategy I have followed is to make long names for the top-level, interface-like functions, and succinct ones for all the internals; i.e. put the verbosity where others need to look up code to use it as a library, where ""library"" is understood as an individual/indepenent component of a larger software project.",1251539376

793014,comment,790800,791595,0,0,peoplerock,,,"Yes, it's a nasty, no-easy-solution dilemma: Shugging off the spammers yet not mistreating the ""false positive"" decent customers that your algorithm bans.<p>What I find distressing (and would find even more so had <i>I</i> been the victim) is that Google refuses to to identify <i>which</i> part of TOS have been violated.  Police and courts have to specify which parts of criminal code a defendant is accused of violating.  Can we not get similar fairness from corporate America?<p>Are you afraid that such clarifications would give too much useful info to actual spammers?<p>Well, maybe a <i>slight</i> edge. But I might compare this to the dilemma that clarifying legal defendants their constitutional rights (""Miranda"" in the U.S.) deprives law enforcement of some opportunities to tap some useful self-incrimination: It's part of the cost of valuing Constitutional rights.  Would Google dare to offer its customers some Consumer Bill of Rights?",1251538687

One of the best things about Matlab is the community of plugins and algorithms, and having a somewhat central repository that makes them easy to find.<p>That being said, requiring Silverlight is a deal breaker for me. I'd also like to see something more like github, where it's easy to fork and make improvements to other people's code.",1251538485

793008,comment,792920,792989,0,0,derefr,,,"> I can't think of anyone good enough to write a robust, performant language interpreter/compiler and runtime balking at implementing algorithms and needing automated translation from a website.<p>You're assuming we're talking about big, robust, powerful languages here. This wouldn't be for those, because those can survive without any help. We're talking about a <i>long tail</i> for language design: if you have an idea (say, Erlang's actor-model-as-core) and want to try it out, writing a standard library is a big barrier to putting out something satisfactory enough for ""normal"" programming that others will want to tinker on your language and help it grow. Imagine if Linus had to invent C when he was starting off with his tiny little prototype of Linux. We have rapid <i>app</i> development; why can't we have rapid <i>language</i> development?",1251537744

793002,comment,792389,792971,0,0,tigerthink,,,">First of all, they cannot increase the latency of their software; in fact, as is explained in the presentation, they work hard to keep it as low as possible and to continue to lower it. An extra layer which must monitor everything would increase latency.<p>Right.  So there is a sweet spot: you want to monitor often enough that you aren't bankrupt in a millisecond, but not so often that your profit becomes 50% of what it could be.  I'm not familiar with the algorithms used in trading, but assuming they're complex, the sanity check that I'm proposing would not use a very large portion of your cycles.<p>>If it's different, then one of them is incorrect.<p>The presenter spoke of humans shutting off the system when it was causing them to lose a lot of money (in older days when their system was slower?)  Presumably the humans were using some algorithm other than the one they implemented to decide whether to shut the system off.  Which algorithm is incorrect?<p>How complicated do you think the algorithm the humans use would be to implement?<p>>You should watch the video, I think you will find especially interesting the part where he describes how they were unable to pay enough money to get people to even carefully review certain types of code.<p>I watched the first half.  I stopped watching when it became apparent that I would get more out of the video if I knew OCaml, and I plan to learn it at some point.<p>>That is a static check. Metamath does not fork a process and monitor your proof, assuming that were somehow possible.<p>I'm talking about the effectiveness of using one system to confirm the correctness of another.  For some reason, someone put a lot of hours into Metamath when they could have put the same hours into checking their own proofs.  Why do you think they did that?<p>A final point: He mentioned that their software is in constant need of updating.  Every update is an opportunity to introduce a critical error.  It seems likely to me that monitoring software would not be in need of constant updating, since the algorithm that the humans use to determine when to turn off the machine probably does not change along with the things he mentioned.",1251536402

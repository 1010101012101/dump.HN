The Romans evacuated Dacia and its capital around year 270, and then everything collapsed. Around Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa writing just vanished, for the next 800 years or so there are no archaeological finds involving written texts (either in stone or on the buildings&#x27; walls). Stone churches started to get built around year 1100-1200, many of them using stone from the Roman ruins. Theater as an art form would only return to the region around year 1600-1700, that&#x27;s almost 1500 years after the Romans had left.",1434409195

There&#x27;s no mention of the most popular early open source (Analog) or closed source (Webtrends) analytics tools.  And how can you spend multiple paragraphs telling the story of how GA came to be the most popular analytics platform without mentioning that it&#x27;s a freebie?  GA is an add-on to Adwords, whereas New Relic costs hundreds per month, and Webtrends/Omniture cost thousands.  And why say &quot;New Relic is its nearest competitor...&quot; when New Relic doesn&#x27;t even compete with GA?  This article is just a shambles.<p>And where is sessionization?  Isn&#x27;t going through a logfile and associating the hits with specific users what made the Webtrends founders rich back in the late 1990s?  Nope, it never existed, just like web data warehouses, OLAP, etc.  In this alternate reality, web analytics moved directly from &quot;glorified hit counters&quot; to &quot;event tracking&quot;.<p>This is not a history of web analytics, it&#x27;s marketing material for Amplitude, whoever they are.

9722698,comment,9719639,9720796,0,0,yoz,,,"I was hired into 18F last year. I work out of San Francisco, where we have a team of about 15 working in the center of the city (UN Plaza). It&#x27;s the second-largest office; the largest is DC, but we have smaller offices in Chicago and NYC, as well as many people working remotely in other parts of the country.<p>I have 20 years of software engineering experience, and the salary I get is competitive with similar salaries in SF. The benefits are decent, plus you get loads of discounts of things just for being a Federal employee.<p>There were several reasons I joined, but patriotism isn&#x27;t one of them: I&#x27;m actually a British citizen who relocated to the USA almost a decade ago. Having kept in touch with friends back in London, I&#x27;m amazed and inspired by what GDS has achieved: they are, quite literally, setting the high water mark for user-centered design and research. Then I looked around the state of US government websites, and I felt what is one of the most common motivations for an engineer: seeing something broken that you know how to fix.<p>Not only are the people here fantastic, but we&#x27;re getting to use better tools and services than I have previously. We started deploying using AWS and all its associated services, but have recently set up Cloud Foundry, and that&#x27;s made fast development and deployment so much easier. (Yay, that wonderful feeling of deleting huge swathes of configuration you just don&#x27;t need any more.) The project I&#x27;m on uses Mandrill and Twilio, plus Snap CI for testing & deployment. (Other projects may use different tools. Not much is mandated.) We all work on MacBook Pros with Thunderbolt Displays. (Some of us run Linux on those MacBooks.)<p>Part of what makes this work so well is that, while 18F does bill clients for our time, our primary motivator is quality rather than profit. We get to do the right thing because it&#x27;s the right thing. If we find a better way to build, we switch to that. I&#x27;ve worked with plenty of startups but I&#x27;ve rarely worked with any team that was able to improve its working methods so quickly.<p>Everything we build is open source by default, available on Github. Plus, we contribute to other FOSS projects (such as the aforementioned Cloud Foundry). I&#x27;ve ended up making PRs back to plenty of libraries and other projects while working on this one to fix minor bugs or add useful features.<p>No, my day job here is not totally free of strange and frustrating bureaucracy, but there&#x27;s far less than you&#x27;d guess, and plenty of freedoms that make up for that. I could bang on about my beliefs about the role of government and politics and how all this should work, and that is all important to me, but it&#x27;s less relevant to the day-to-day work. And so far, that work is immensely satisfying.",1434408846

Not sure either is a great option for the future.<p>Note: Yes micropayments/universal &quot;internet&quot; subscriptions might work but this is a far greater problem than people make it out to be. Any company attempting to do this will need massive scale, perfect tracking (again privacy issues here), secure access to billing and identity and ease of use for users. They will possibly help from either ISPs or some other infrastructure layer to actually make this work and even Google is having trouble with their 2nd try at a micropayments model in their new Contributor program.

9722628,comment,9721478,9721478,0,0,xoa,,,"The debate about whether students are being insufficiently challenged in terms of opinions and beliefs appears to be a growing one, and it ties into the debate on academic freedom on college campuses that has existed since at least the 1800s. It&#x27;s somewhat distinct though from the more generalized debate about Free Speech in overall society, and I have to wonder in this case if The Economist (and many others) aren&#x27;t picking the wrong correlation here. While the exact reasoning changes over the decades, &quot;so and so professor should be pressured/fired for saying something I don&#x27;t like&quot; remains constant and the answer was the tenure system. I think the modern decline of tenure positions is actually much more of the actual, root cause of any problems we&#x27;re seeing right now. Overall popular opinions are always in flux and new trends come and go, and right now extreme sensitivity towards anything that might make someone uncomfortable seems to enjoy popular support. But just like with previous trends, if a professor had tenure they&#x27;d be equally free to argue back as hard as they wished and tell students to either successfully convince the professor, shape up, or suck eggs.<p>It&#x27;s true that in many cases economic pressure on some colleges have become heavier over the years as public funding has evaporated, but economic pressure is still economic pressure and has always existed with the same natural result. Money talks. Counteracting that natural trend with mechanisms like tenure is much more important and lastingly useful then trying to apply bandaids to any particular trend of the day. With a strong basic framework ensuring that debate can continue even in the face of popular consensus, there is a much higher chance that the marketplace of ideas will succeed and prevent any permanent fall into a local minima. It&#x27;s somewhat disappointing that The Economist of all places would fail to explore this, with even the very word &quot;tenure&quot; not showing up at all.",1434408301

Sure, you might want/need to read a couple manpages, but this is the case with systemd, too.<p>Back to the GNU/Linux world, the complexity of SysVInit is not a hard dependency of using shell scripts for daemon management; there&#x27;s very little stopping a GNU/Linux system from adopting a BSD-style rc system, rc.subr, etc. and making life significantly easier for sysadmins.  Alternately, there&#x27;s very little stopping a GNU/Linux system from implementing shell scripts in something significantly less horrendous to use, such as an interpreted scripting language (like Perl or Python or Ruby).  SysVInit and BSD-style rc-based init both have a distinct lack of hard requirements on how initscripts are implemented, so long as said scripts are valid executables.<p>> Maybe there&#x27;s something to be said for &quot;sysadmins who want to be able to model the entire boot process and run-state in their head&quot; but with correct information about dependencies and so on, I personally think that&#x27;s something computers are a lot better at solving.<p>Would you not want to be able to model the startup process and run-state of the software you write in your head?  Why should the underlying operating system be any different?  If you have to rely upon external tools just to be able to reason about the execution flow of something - your server, your program, your recipe for lamb vindaloo, whatever - chances are it&#x27;s <i>way</i> too complicated and needs significant refactoring.",1434408173

There are a lot of people who have trouble getting good employment for various reasons beyond their control. To worry about those who are already employed, <i>especially</i> when they make &quot;wrong speech&quot; about those who are not (e.g., an IAC executive talking about AIDS victims in Africa), seems to be misplaced priorities. If we truly believe that people should not be losing their living for small mistakes, we should also believe that people should not lose their living for <i>no</i> mistake, either, and we should find a way for everyone to live a comfortable, happy life, whether or not any employer wants to associate with them.<p>The second is that I don&#x27;t believe that this is actually happening. There&#x27;s been a certain scientist in the news recently, who resigned from his job, but has kept his knighthood and Nobel Prize. This does not seem like <i>unlimited</i> consequence and going into hiding and starting a new life. It certainly does not seem like a poor-taste joke made to 50 Twitter followers; the comment in question was given in an invited speech at a conference with a worldwide audience.<p>I believe there is certainly an incentive for the powerful to weave a story that regular innocent people are losing their lives for an honest mistake, since they want to protect their power (the same reason they <i>have</i> the opinions that people find distasteful: they act in accordance with those opinions, to protect their power).

If an artist wants to do something that emotionally charged, I think they need more skin in the game than this guy had.<p>All the article claims happened, as far as I see, is that the art was taken down, and the school apologized they didn&#x27;t take it down earlier.  The language the school used in its apology seems a little hyperbolic, but whatever.  Assuming this is the sum reaction against the artist (and maybe there are more repercussions), then I think that&#x27;s all a reasonable risk that an artist takes and the artist should take his punches and move on.<p>Creative defacement of the art would have been a more interesting in-kind response, but I suppose that ship has sailed.",1434407478

Just because a feasibility study says it is feasible does not actually make it feasible.  I skimmed the document you linked and nothing in it pertains to large ground movements that would occur due to fault offset - it is all with relation to ground shaking rather than fault slip.  Further, it is common knowledge, in fact, that underground structures generally perform better under ground shaking as compared to above ground structures except when the structure crosses the fault which experiences the offset.  That is, tunnels work better than pylons except at the point where the large offset occurs.<p>I understand that you may not be an engineer.  I am an engineer, with my area of expertise being in geo-structural interaction, and I am telling you that your statement about a tunnel not being feasible because of earthquakes is NOT correct.

Once you change your password on a server, there&#x27;s little harm in publishing it -- it can&#x27;t be used any more.  But the key is a file that may still exist (see also Wikileaks&#x27; key being published by David Leigh).<p>Consider: your database exists as a file.  If someone is able to gain access to a copy, that copy remains valid as long as at least one password within it remains unchanged.  So you need a strong key, because it&#x27;s subject to offline bruteforcing.  Now they get a second copy of your database, with a different password.  If any of your passwords are ever published or cracked, your database is exposed.  If you have to change your password regularly, it&#x27;s going to be tempting to make it weaker, or to store it somewhere less securely.  If you&#x27;re using key files, they only need to get one of your files.  It seems to me that the more key material you need to secure, the more difficult it&#x27;s going to be?<p>Anyone who knows better want to chime in?",1434406148

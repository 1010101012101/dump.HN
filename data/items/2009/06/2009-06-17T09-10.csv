But then, the popularity of a service hugely depends on the size of its userbase right? How would tgethr ever get a huge userbase by putting restrictions and making people buy to get a feel in the first place.<p>I think the domain togethr.com would've been better, matches the pronounciation ... tgethr sounds like T gethr or something... I keep forgetting the domain for I thought it was togethr when I tried to open it after 20 minutes...<p>I wish tgethr could have a nice favicon, can't see any in chrome.<p>BstOfLck",1245232570

1) 20% ""business tax"" or knowing the right people. Can be interpreted as paying someone 20% of X to put me in contact with the right people. The point is getting business done should be transparent and only the buyer and seller need to exchange any money. Paying 10 guys in between is not how normal business gets done.<p>2) I feel very strongly about police corruption. Even if it is only a small powerful minority. The fact is the rest of them know there is a problem but won't do anything to stop it. Which means they are part of the problem. And if they are overshadowing then it is institutional corruption. And once they are that embedded than numbers don't matter because every part of it is rotten.",1245232454

I only played with the first Android release so far. Yet, honestly, for me the Iphone developer documentation and support seem by far better.<p>Openness?
Why do I still have to jailbreak and unlock an Android phone, when it is so open? (Rhetorical Question)<p>Price?
Yes, check if you want phones with really bad battery lifetime (so far, let's see when a decent phone comes out, I might reconsider).<p>Btw, is it true that you can only use the phones if you have a google account and that there are several phone home features in the phone?",1245231647

I was part of a site that used it to provide new users easy access to the IRC room; in that case, it would be less technical visitors using the mibbit (iframe) interface. Many of these sites were previously using Java applets, but the only one I generally see has poor usability and can be quite slow. Mibbit is a very strong alternative for non-technical users in this case. I haven't even addressed the case of people using it to get into IRC in general, which is also probably going on to some level.",1245229500

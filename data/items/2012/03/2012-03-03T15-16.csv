3660306,comment,3657542,3658090,2,0,wpietri,,,"There are a few ways to handle technical work like that.<p>The simplest one is just to do those things as features require it. Most non-developers don't care about what the details of you're doing anyhow, so just don't tell 'em.<p>The next way is to maintain a technical queue that's parallel to the main story queue. We use this mainly for improvements that speed the development process generally but no particular feature requires it. It's just understood that developers will do some of that each week. As long as we keep delivering other stuff, it's fine.<p>The hardest way is to put technical cards in the product queue. I tend to reserve this for things that are large enough to have schedule impacts because getting a product person to understand the importance of some technical thing is always an uphill battle.<p>For a lot of things, the real trick is to turn something from a ""technical"" card into one with direct end-user benefit. E.g., putting in a load balancer. Instead of talking about that, I write cards like ""system handles X simultaneous users"" and ""system survives single-box failure"".

Basically operations is going to 'lose the war' of trying to control every device that is inside your network because there are phones, and tablets, and personal computers etc. which all want to be 'connected' at some level. So creating an infrastructure that is tolerant of that may ultimately become the norm.<p>Apparently in some sensitive facilities there are networks keyed off by MAC address, and then 802.1x key, so you need to have both the right MAC and the right key for that MAC to get an address and to send and receive packets. Connecting to the network switch with a 'non-authorized' MAC puts you on a different VPN than the if you connect with an authorized machine.<p>One of the attendees at the show told me they assumed that their network was 'unsafe' all the time and planned accordingly.<p>Now its probably naive to think we would go there in a year or two but it does seem to be a road we're being inexorably forced down.",1330789590

If you're running on bare metal machines and performance is your requirement, you're going to require more vertical scaling on AWS. If you are paying for boxes that are underutilized, then, you might find running on AWS to be cheaper.<p>You also have the advantage of AWS scaling and the ability to do things you probably cannot do with your existing host. First and foremost, if you're moving to AWS, make sure you can split your services into multiple availability zones. A lot of people got burned when they put their entire company in separate deployments within the same availability zone.<p>Is price your only motivation to move? If so, ask your current provider to renegotiate. Have quotes from two competing providers so show them that you have investigated other providers that appear to offer a better deal.<p>I don't know what your company does, but, unless you have a ton of hardware you're really not utilizing, simply moving to the cloud isn't a silver bullet for cost savings. Things don't run the same way and there is definitely a different paradigm to implementation. You will likely spend a lot of your cost savings, if any, in re-engineering your current processes to better fit the cloud.<p>Are you hiring people at your company to maintain the AWS installation?

There aren't <i>that</i> many flagship franchises for either of the consoles, and just look at how Nintendo basically don't know how to innovate in videogames anymore and end up releasing Zelda 15, Mario 8, and Mario Kart/Party/Tennis/Golf Umpteen as a result. The iPhone is destroying the handheld market, and I'm sure Activision will figure out how to develop Call of Duty for the new console, if it gains traction.<p>Valve will allow their customers to play their games on Mac, Windows, and their console, if any versions are available, due to the cross-platform presence of Steam - they have basically already done this with Sony. That's new and very alluring, although I have to wonder how they will manage the disk space of the console. Maybe people will have to buy the physical version of the games and use the Steam key to let them download it to their Mac and PC. The prospect of selling your games directly to your customers with no expenditures save bandwidth through Steam might help the platform earn a profit, too.",1330787991

But that is really besides the point, the point is people use religion et. al. as a scape goat for mans inhumanity to man. Human nature is complex and men have used all kinds of excuses to drive men to kill one another. If anything religion proves this, I mean all of the books pretty much universally say be a nice person, yet ""men"" are some how able to convince others that they say kill at the whims of your religious leader. Religion does not by any means have a monopoly on driving men to war. Look at the Army commercials they are geared towards appealing to the new secular godless man. They just replace god with Nobility, Honor and country. Men will kill each other over football, to see it as anything other than human nature is to mask the real issue, and prolongs finding the solution.<p><i>I just didn't agree with your argument that Anonymous is targetting a bunch of people who're harmlessly minding their own business.</i><p>So you argue that they should be held accountable for the sins of their fathers, because some religious person somewhere along the way killed a witch, then every religious person today is guilty. If that is the case should we not be held accountable for the sins of our fathers, any genocide committed by our fathers should it not also be our fault as well. I personally know many religious people and churches that have never persecuted another person and I personally think that yes they are harmlessly minding there own business. Unless we want to hold them accountable for history in which case we should be willing to take the same critical look at all groups we are linked to through history. I for one am German by ethnicity but I really don't want the sins of my history put on my shoulders, especially given the fact that I don't even live in Germany nor have I ever stepped foot there.<p>Further another often overlooked statistic is that religious organizations contribute to philanthropic causes 10 to 1 over secular organizations. We like to model the secularist billionaire like Ted Turner as the new model of giving but the reality of it is, the churches are still doing the lions share of the work. But just as we should not hold them accountable for the past of others we should not give all religious organizations credit for that giving and betterment of humanity. Each group is different, each church is different and each person is different and they should be judged by their deeds and not generalized with blanket statements about religion. Because religion can be both good or bad because it is an organization of men. And men are both good and bad.",1330786934

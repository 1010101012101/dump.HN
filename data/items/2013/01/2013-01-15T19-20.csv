Note that Tumbleweed is basically a rolling release but based on the current stable version, which means you update normally upon a new distro release and over time updated packages (Kernel/KDE/Gnome/XFCE etc. etc.) are being added as they are being submitted into Factory, the development branch.<p>[2]: Unfortunately, though SELinux is a work-in-progress right now: <a href=""https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:SELinux"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:SELinux</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:One_Click_Install"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:One_Click_Install</a><p>[4]: Yast lets you use a GUI for a number of things like adding users, setting up servers, runlevels(!) etc. I see many people disliking it, but I am unsure why. It is nice to have sometimes, but at no point are you ever forced to use it, in fact, editing configs directly works just as well.<p>P.S.: You can of course also run openSUSE factory straight away, it often works, however, since that is where development happens, things might break. This is much the same as Fedora Rawhide, and it might (or might not happen) that someone on a given day breaks something essential (like say...systemd). So consider yourself warned! ;)<p>edit: formatting & added fluffing to Factory explanation!",1358278833

It sounds reasonable, however you cannot modify what is in the Places menu, so even if the folder doesn't exist, you're stuck with it. I don't have a Videos folder, but I cannot remove it from the sidebar.<p>They've also removed the tree view from Nautilus, I used it all the time, but now it's gone. I need multiple windows to look at the contents of multiple folders at once.<p>I cannot make a new empty file directly inside Nautilus. I could understand if this had never existed , but not why they'd remove it now.<p>The App Menu, or whatever they're calling it, is confusing. Nautilus has a button on the toolbar which seems to cover half of the options, and uses the App Menu for the remaining options.<p>The Connect To Server dialog has been changed, for no reason as far as I can tell. It now only has a text box for entering the URI, no easy-to-use Protocol/Server/Port/Username/Password sections.<p>Typing to locate a file will no longer take you to that file, but instead start a search. I personally hate this, although I could understand why some may prefer this.<p>In terms of system configuration, they've stripped a bunch of options out, again.<p>I can no longer enable horizontal scrolling using my touchpad.<p>You can no longer select a background image which is outside of the root Pictures folder (Non-recursive). You cannot even specify a different folder.<p>You cannot specify the background scaling (Zoom seems to be the default, no tiling, or centering etc.)<p>Problems with are still around:

The incidences of violent crime have dropped steadily year after year since 1990, including forcible rape[1]. The internet was introduced in 1989, so the introduction of the internet coincides directly with the introduction of the medium which provides porn to most porn consumers.<p>This is only a correlation. No causation can be should. You could argue that the drop in rape incidents is attributable to better crime fighting technology that has put more serial rape offenders behind bars. It's anybody's guess as to the cause of lower incidents of forcible rape, but what you can't do is attribute greater incidents of forcible rape with the rise in porn because the actual historical figures simply don't support that conclusion, in fact they contradict it despite any self reports of hypothetical behavior might suggest.<p>I don't know the figures, but I imagine that most incidents of rape involve someone the victim knows and involves ambiguous circumstances such as both the victim and the accused being under the influence of alcohol or some other voluntarily consumed mind altering substance. For rape under those conditions, both the victim and accused are equally at fault, just like a drunk driver is responsible for a car accident. Driving your body into another under the influence is not really not that dissimilar from driving a car into another under the influence. Your approach of educating your daughters into making the right decisions and avoiding risky situations is the best weapon you have to combat the risk of rape.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.lowtechcombat.com/2010/12/50-year-trends-in-violent-crime-in-us.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lowtechcombat.com/2010/12/50-year-trends-in-viole...</a>",1358278637

But note that the court sustained the objection to the police officer's inference that his silence was evidence of guilt, and required the prosecuting attorney to elicit a description of his actions (looking at feet, tightening up) in lieu of conclusory testimony about the significance of same.<p>On the other hand, the prosecutors reference in the summing up is not evidence. It's like pointing at a defendant and saying 'look! he sits there showing no remorse. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, is there any doubt that this man is a cold-blooded criminal?' It's a an empty rhetorical argument, but no more so than 'My client has the face of a baby, look how sweet and innocent he is - you must acquit!'. Those statements aren't offered as facts for consideration, but as the opinion of counsel, which the jury is free to ignore. Witness testimony is supposed to be dry and factual; attorneys can work themselves into Shakesperean fits of indignation if they feel like it (I exaggerate, but not that much...I'd personally like to see stricter standards about this).<p><i>Surely that's the only way to ensure a suspect's silence will not be held against him?</i><p>But the jury <i>is</i> quite entitled to hold it against him. That's their call to make. What's not allowed is for the <i>prosecution</i> to say that the failure to answer is legal proof of guilt. Failure to answer does not unask the question, as it were.<p>I don't think we are sacrificing vital constitutional protections here. The guy wasn't under compulsion, and the record shows that his silence wasn't used as the basis of an improper arrest. The constitution is very explicit about scope of the 5th amendment, and there's a good deal of precedent backing up the court's decision.",1358278061

</code></pre>
From what I've read elsewhere, of the 10% or so that do go to trial, something like 9 times out of 10 the verdict is guilty. Given that a federal criminal trial takes $1.5 million to defend and that the prosecutor has all the weight and resources of the federal government behind then and the citizen has to rely on his own financial resources (which are likely to be frozen if they are well-heeled defendants), then that rate of conviction isn't surprising in the least. Federal criminal cases are totally asymmetric in favor of the federal government. As citizens, we always complain of well funded people prevailing in civil and criminal cases because of the money they have to defend themselves, but we ignore the well funded prosecution that US district attorneys have that allow them to consistently find people guilty who may not be.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/2003/10/v26n3-7.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regul...</a>",1358277682

5062243,comment,5060076,5060076,3,0,kafkaesque,,,"I've been writing 'seriously' for about 17 years.<p>I think what the OP says is great advice. The list is especially useful for beginner writers, because it gives them a specific guide to follow.<p>I was taught the value of an introductory sentence and paragraph differently. I was told to simply ""Be specific!"" If you have a look at his dos, this simple phrase is put to use in all of them. The don'ts are the opposite: they're vague. I default to this be-specific phrase when I write.<p>Having said that, writing is such a tricky thing. All throughout my academic history, I've been taught the 'principles' of style only to have to unlearn half of them and adapt to a new 'standard'.<p>As a few people have written, context matters.<p>In the end (and in practice), you have to consider your audience, how much time you have to write (if it is your job, because there are hundreds of content mills), develop your own style (this itself is a trite/clichd remark), but most importantly, have a reason to write that word or punctuation. This last concept is what I adhere to, which is why I only write short stories and poems. Novels are a completely different beast, though I am working on one slowly but surely.<p>I can read Shelley and Keats and love every expressed emotion. Most people will tell me, ""But it's soooooo cheeeesy!"" Damn right it is. So? What's your point? Context. Business writing is not creative writing is not poetry is not a short story is not a novel. Likewise, romanticism is not modernism is not postmodernism is not magical realism is not anything.<p>If you think about it, writing is a very depressing art form. It is one of few skills that has a low price tag in a society yet is valued by everyone. ""Oh, he's a great writer! Found his book for cheap at a used bookstore! $1 for a classic!"" The only writers that make a good chunk of change are the Stephanie Meyers or the sci-fi writers that pump out a book a month. Author mills. It is rumoured that it took Ezra Pound about six months to write a three-verse poem. Can people even tell the difference? Some say they can.<p>It's difficult to go in to an interview and act like I really know how to write. My use of grammar and style is poor. I edit a lot. Revise, revise, revise. It takes me an hour or more to write a short paragraph. It doesn't come naturally to me. The only thing I do better than others is spell correctly.<p>There is an ongoing joke that is repeated pseudosincerely: the worst thing you can do is take advice from a writer.<p>So what do I know.<p>PS: One of my favourite opening sentences comes from Camus's L'tranger:<p>Aujourd'hui, maman est morte. (Mother died today.)<p>This one is from Kafka's Der Prozess:<p>Jemand mute Josef K. verleumdet haben, denn ohne da er etwas Bses getan htte, wurde er eines Morgens verhaftet.

5062227,comment,5051892,5059008,1,0,Mz,,,"Re the logical progression: I imagine I could say a lot more about it. I spent time in therapy. I spent a lot of time reading, journaling, contemplating sexual morality and the like. So there is certainly a rich background that informed my thought process. But I laid out my logic as best I could concerning what I actually thought in concluding that emphasizing consent was the single strongest and most civilized measure I could take. Without going back to reread it, I will add that I may not have touched on this: I also did not leave my children with sitters they did not like. Even as babies, if they disliked someone, I made other arrangements.<p>As for adult women: Violent assault out of nowhere with no warning is incredibly rare. The vast majority of rapes (and child molestation) start with disrespecting social boundaries and escalate. It is almost always someone you know who has opportunity to worm their way inside your defenses and has spent some time doing so. Women are generally raped by ""friends"", relatives, coworkers, dates and other members of their social circle. Being randomly assaulted by a stranger is the exception. As an adult, I have never faced imminent violent assault of that sort, though I have routinely faced social situations wherein some man was pretty clearly up to no good. I have a track record of not allowing them to escalate. If you don't allow the escalation, it gets pretty darn hard to take advantage of someone.<p>Please remember that the definition of rape hinges on the detail of consent. Most rapes do not involve significant violence. A lot of rapes boil down to tragic misunderstanding. I am pretty darn confident that most men who would be okay with manipulating and maneuvering me and cavalier about whether or not I really wanted sex would absolutely not resort to violent assault if I simply refuse to engage them in their sick little game. I am confident of it in part because I have a long history of doing exactly that. I have been met with anger, frustration, shame, and other strong negative emotions. But I have not been violently assaulted and brutally raped for refusing to go along with their plans to have me, like it or not.<p>As for physical defense, it is possible I am somewhat biased about not needing any particular preparation due in part to my ""cultural"" background, for lack of a better word. I had a knife collection as a child. My father was a career soldier who grew up on a farm. There were guns on the wall and I knew how to use them. My ex was a career soldier. He took martial arts, had a knife collection, and owned a couple of swords (a real katana and a wooden practice katana). I am 5'8"" tall and athletically inclined. My oldest son tells me he has watched me face down a threatening group of three or four men and my subconscious response was to position myself to be able to grab the nearest impromptu weapon should it escalate. Having been slapped around by a drug addicted relative, I have some firsthand familiarity with violence. I am aware I will fight back when faced with such.<p>Still, I was not taught to shoot on the idea that I might need to kill a rapist. I find that a somewhat horrifying message to give a young woman. Yes, other people can be dangerous. But that is true of both men and women and it is not particular to sexual situations. Suggesting that it is sounds pretty emotionally poisonous to me. (Which may not be at all what the OP is doing. I am trying to answer <i>your</i> question, not slander him.) Having good boundaries is a generally more useful and better solution than being prepared for the worst. Preparing for the worst can be self fulfilling prophecy.<p>My experience is that victimizers are not just bad people. They are also victims of a social paradigm which gives them no other viable choice. Having been trained to be a professional victim and then retrained myself, I am clear that part of the problem is that we teach women to be prey. If you run from a bear or wolf, it will chase you. Your flight incites its predatory chase instinct. Backing away slowly is a much better plan. You are much less likely to get mauled. That same general principal applies when dealing with another potentially predatory animal: Humankind.<p>I do not believe that overemphasizing a need to be prepared to physically assault another person is a means to teach women to not behave as prey in relation to men. I think it mostly reinforces the mental model that women are, in fact, prey. It strikes me as counterproductive to frame it that way. Again: I learned to shoot as a child. I was a damn good shot at one time. I was aware that my father viewed the guns on the wall as a potential means of defense if someone invaded our home. But they were also tools by which food was put on the table. He hunted. I grew up eating squirrel and deer. So my exposure to guns was not a strong message that the point was to shoot other people. For one thing, I was taught to shoot in part as a gun safety issue. It was part of teaching me guns are not toys and you do not play with them.<p>So I don't have any problem whatsoever with teaching children to shoot or enrolling them in martial arts. But I am very leery of doing so with some implicit or explicit message that it is something a girl needs to know ""to deal with rapists"". The main thing a girl needs to know is how to insist a man treat her with respect. That will protect her far better and in far more situations than being a good shot. Violence is not the best antidote to violence. Respect is overall a better antidote. It is more likely to actually prevent violence rather than merely invert who got hurt.<p>Since you mentioned it, I will suggest you are putting your children at grave risk to view protecting their sexuality as an issue for their teen years. I was molested as a toddler and again from age 11 to 13.5. I did not get my period until I was nearly 17. My lack of sexual maturity did not prevent me from being raped at age 12. If you are worried about predators, your daughters' sexual maturation is not that relevant to the problem. Teach them now that they have a right to say ""no"" to unwanted affection -- to anyone, you included, with zero need to justify it. Be prepared to back their decision if someone else will not take ""no"" for an answer from them. Tell them that is the policy -- that it is their choice and they can call on you to back them if necessary.<p>Thank you very much for asking.",1358277205

The only difference is that contracts <i>without</i> the exemption (ie, total assignments) are considered enforceable, whereas in California, they aren't. That doesn't mean that Californian contracts don't sometimes include those clauses anyway - from a legal strategy standpoint, it's in the company's best interest to do so.<p>Furthermore, my understanding is that this Californian precedent is rather limited in practice, since it's easy for a company to claim that your product is related to something that the company is doing or is planning on doing (and hard to prove otherwise), and similarly easy for them to claim that you've used company resources and/or time to do the project, as people sometimes do without thinking about it. When you start picking it apart, the Californian exemption is very narrow in letter, and even more so in practice.<p>In short, you're definitely not missing out on anything automatically by coming to New York, because it depends on what kind of a contract you negotiate. And Californian law won't get you home free either, because there are too many other variables at play, and too many other ways for them to wiggle around the law - they just need the incentive to do so.",1358276883

5062125,comment,5060076,5060076,7,0,jonnathanson,,,"Most people stop reading something after the first few sentences. In that crucial 10 to 15 seconds, a book (or essay, or article, or blog post) has to make, and win, a subconscious appeal to your attention. Your reader's attention span is like a snotty doorman at a hot club. Your opening sentence needs to grab his interest and sneak the rest of the piece into the door.<p>Consider the following examples from fiction:<p>""It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.""  --George Orwell, <i>1984</i><p>""It was a pleasure to burn.""  --Ray Bradbury, <i>Fahrenheit 451</i><p>""As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect.""  --Franz Kafka, <i>The Metamorphosis</i><p>Or these examples from nonfiction:<p>""Air-conditioned, odorless, illuminated by buzzing flourescent tubes, the American market doesn't present itself as having very much to do with Nature.""  --Michael Pollan, <i>The Omnivore's Dilemma</i><p>""I like to take my time when I pronounce someone dead.""  --Jane Churchon, ""The Dead Book""<p>""Out of nowhere I developed this lump.""  --David Sedaris, ""Old Faithful""<p>This is not to suggest that opening lines should be pure gimmickry, or that they should be conceived entirely apart from the rest of the piece itself. Provocation for provocation's sake is a game of diminishing returns. Rather, the opening line should immediately intrigue the reader by establishing a compelling tone -- one that the rest of the work will follow.<p>Compelling does not necessarily mean brief, though in modern practice, the two are frequently corelated. That being said, some of the best opening lines in literary history are long and winding. The key is setting up intrigue, however many words that may take.",1358276472

When people can't afford justice, justice may as well not exist.

However, AppScale is just an API shim over memcache and a number of different databases such as Redis or mysql.

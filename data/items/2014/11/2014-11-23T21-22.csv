8650092,comment,8649727,8649727,0,0,techjuice,,,"Well in life you have to eventually make the choice of following the sheep herd (the employee) or becoming the sheep herder (the boss man (not a middle manager), founder, SME consultant or contractor with their own company).  The latter is a very rough road and most will not be able to push through the barrier to entry but you will never know if you do go through the process of doing it.<p>In your situation you are apart of the herd as most of us are in the beginning and many of us will stay there for our entire lives ( Because it is easier and normally equals a nice steady, reliable paycheck).  Many of us are brought up to do good in school, get great grades, go to popular colleges, go get a popular degree or degrees and land a great job.<p>You are getting a peak under the hood of some of the bad habits of some businesses.  You are not supposed to know you are being underpaid but since you know this information (information is power) you now have the opportunity to change your career path.  Also don&#x27;t worry about your coworkers as I can guarantee they are not worrying about you and your pay.<p>Time to start a new job search and match the job requirements with your experience and skill sets.  If you honestly are very good in a high demand, low supply technology/programming language you can negotiate a higher salary.<p>Just to give a breakdown on the potential of what you could accomplish if you have what employers are hungry looking for and you are not on the be your own boss route yet.  Normally in the USA if your a junior programmer you can make $65,000+ minimum, 40 hour work week, some rare overtime, PTO, DTO, and full benefits.  If you are an intermediate developer/sys administrator you can negotiate around $80,000 minimum and if your a senior developer you can demand $90,000 to $200,000 a year depending on how difficult your craft.  If you are an expert $200,000 to $300,000 a year and if your a master $300,000 to many millions but at that point you should probably be running your own company and working on taking it public to increase your total earning power within a short period of time.  If an employer tells you they cannot pay that type of salary, find one that will just note the more your paid the more that will be demanded from you so you have to stay on top of your game.<p>If your not a founder of a company, CEO or other extremely highly compensated C-Level executive or top business/tech brass you should not be putting in more than 40 hours a week on a regular basis unless you knowingly signed up for it (Military, intelligence community, NOC, on-call type work).<p>During your job search compare your skill sets and experience with salaries available on Glassdoor, indeed, Bureau of Labor, etc. in your area. If you have little to no experience in the technology your working in below junior (journeyman) your pay will more then likely be under $65,000/year as there would be no way to justify paying or demanding more if this is your first time using the technology.<p>Relying on a bonus is only OK if your already happy with your salary as the bonus is after all just a bonus.  If your a core part of the business you should not be getting paid bottom dollar for your efforts and should negotiate more for your contributions.  If negotiations are unsuccessful, find a company that will pay you what your worth.  If your at the top talent pool in your specialty you should not have to worry about what your salary is but should be thinking about what your going to do on your next vacation, retirement planning, family and other non work related fun things.",1416779831

8650078,comment,8646948,8646948,0,0,jmarantz,,,"This is a great debate.  I&#x27;ve thought about this quite a bit lately when the PageSpeed team was contacted by Microsoft [1] about the conflict between PageSpeed assuming that Android 4.0 can handle webp, and mobile IE masquerading as Android thus breaking on PageSpeed enabled sites.<p>The debate will never end but it&#x27;s nice to understand the perspectives.<p>PageSpeed, plus other WPO tools and complex sites, want the first view to be fast and small.  We measure our effectiveness on first-view speedup.  The most effective way to get this is by UA sniffing.  We know about the other mechanisms and use them too at times, but they don&#x27;t produce results that are as good for metrics we care about.  However we are pretty serious about doing a good job about robust UA parsing; we put more energy into getting this right than a web developer should be expected to expend.  The downside (as Microsoft points out) is that when we have to make an update we can&#x27;t push it to all our users instantly.  We should consider mechanisms to dynamically load an updated UA-mapping from a server we control when PageSpeed starts up, but haven&#x27;t started such an effort.<p>Browser vendors have their own legitimate motivations.  Microsoft IE11 developers don&#x27;t want to be punished for the shortcomings of earlier versions of IE, and want users of IE11 to get the best, most modern web sites possible, not the IE6 version.  Microsoft justifiably wants servers to send mobile versions of sites to Windows Phones.  I totally sympathize with their perspective.  Chrome was in the same boat when it first launched so it has all kinds of masquerading in its UA and unfortunately still does.  Same story, different decade.<p>[1] <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/modpagespeed/issues/detail?id=978"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/modpagespeed/issues/detail?id=978</a>",1416779617

While America may have more of a functioning democratic republic <i>on the surface</i>, the clear message of actions such as these -- as I saw it -- was that <i>at the top</i> America is a nation of men and not of laws.<p>When people who know the right people get in trouble, laws no longer matter. Any and every measure will be deployed to bail them out, even at the expense of the long term health of the nation and of the civilian economy. We live in a nation run for the benefit of those who run it, not its people.<p>This has deep implications going forward.<p>It&#x27;s a clear signal to the American people that if something really bad does happen, like a <i>serious</i> financial crash or worse, we must assume that the authority figures are not on our side. We can and will be sacrificed for the benefit of the connected.<p>Secondly, it means that we must expect the situation to worsen. As time goes on we must expect more and more of the legacy gloss of a functioning republic to flake away, revealing the machinery of arbitrary lawless power that is operating beneath. Unless something fundamentally changes we will become a classic corrupt and barbaric empire, and then rubble. We&#x27;re probably still early in the process, but that&#x27;s the trajectory.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is overreaction. To me there&#x27;s something different about the 2008 reaction vs. Watargate, or the overreach of J. Edgar Hoover&#x27;s FBI, or anything else for that matter. For all those things it was possible to make a reasonable argument that they were <i>exceptions</i> driven by rogue or out of control actors within a system of democratic republicanism that was still basically intact. Nixon and Hoover were &quot;cowboys.&quot; But this is just so &quot;business as usual,&quot; so utterly without clear authorship, that it betrays this kind of favoritism as standard procedure rather than an exception.<p>It&#x27;s the <i>banality</i> of it. There was no Hoover, no Nixon, not even a 9/11 or other traumatic event to inspire emotional over-reaction. It was just an economic crunch, a particularly bad one, and there were many options that did not involve obvious cronyism. Yet these were not taken, not even entertained. The message was: &quot;<i>Of course</i> you&#x27;ll be sacrificed to rescue Goldman Sachs. They&#x27;re members of the nobility and you&#x27;re not.&quot;<p>I&#x27;d describe it as a total loss of confidence in my country. I no longer believe America is in any way special or remarkable. It is morally equivalent to other totalitarian oligarchies. It can only be said to be superior in pragmatic ways.<p>P.S. The Iraq War is a close runner-up, but as I allude to above that is somewhat &quot;excusable&quot; or at least explainable as emotionally driven overreach due to a traumatizing event. It can also be attributed to a list of identifiable actors -- there is someone to blame. There&#x27;s still a sense that it wasn&#x27;t business as usual. I do not expect that America will arbitrarily embark on another pointless invasion anytime soon, but I <i>do</i> fully expect that if another financial crash happens my and every other American who isn&#x27;t a member of the connected nobility will have their futures sacrificed without a second thought. We now clearly have a noble class that are &quot;more equal&quot; than anyone else.<p>I also still hold out some hope that this trend can be reversed, but only if the level of political discourse in America can be elevated above naive ideological pandering and tabloidism.",1416777912

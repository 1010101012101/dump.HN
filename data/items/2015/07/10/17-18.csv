There is so much under the surface stuff that goes into fueling ideas and shaping them. If a funny meme can explode in popularity over the internet, why can&#x27;t an opinion that has no foundation in the facts, but instead it just &#x27;clicks&#x27; correctly with a set of minds? It is nonsensical, but yet, it makes sense.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it is genuinely easier to criticize something than it is to make a positive or neutral comment. I am interested in whether it is possible to have intelligent and polite discussion last for longer than what seems to be seconds at a time, in public, anonymous forums.<p>I do know that I have been thinking about developing an intellect that is okay with being confused for extended periods of time, just because it&#x27;s something that I haven&#x27;t tried to do in all my years of internet communication and various other kinds of education. I don&#x27;t know what would happen to the shape of technology, of coding, of ideas, of analysis, if many people at once, gave themselves the chance to breathe, instead of having to constantly digest (or verify against their own) a selected path in a realm of chaotic, loosely connected, incomparable, inconstrastable, unsortable, etc, ideas. I just feel like this constant reaction to preference makes us feel like we are in control, when it&#x27;s more that our individual control begins to control us.<p>The shape of reasoning for technology in the contemporary age looks more like that which is irrational and disorderly.<p>/shrug",1436551149
9865596,comment,9864783,9864783,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"This sounds a lot like a story from 20 years ago, that was probably in Discover Magazine or Scientific American.  The new nucleotides at that time were labeled kappa and chi.<p>And as a point of fact, three-base segments of DNA to not have a one-to-one mapping to amino acids.  I also believe that a non-standard use of one of the three stop codons can change an encoded methionine to selenomethionine, with similar special cases for other proteins using rare amino acids.<p>Furthermore, 6^3=216, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that adding a new base pair can code for that many amino acids.  The original set of 4, with 64 possible codons, usually encode for 20 amino acids (excepting special cases as with selenomethionine).  mRNA also employs uracil and tRNA adds hypoxanthine.  These lead to &quot;<i>wobble pairs</i>&quot; which in turn allow a single tRNA to match several different-but-synonymous codons.<p>As it stands now, every codon without a matching tRNA would be a different variety of stop codon.<p>Now, what would be interesting to me is if the P-Z pairs could match some tRNA anticodons that translate stereoisomers of the standard 20 amino acids (or actually just the 19 that are chiral).  That way, the D-(KLAKLAK)2 apoptosis promoter sequence could be synthesized directly by the ordinary transcription-translation mechanics of a cell.",1436551135

9865575,comment,9863919,9865406,0,0,Nadya,,,"<i>>Whites in the US are less likely to be Christian than Blacks.</i><p>There are more white Christians than white Athiests and white &quot;Other&quot; religions. Regardless if only 60% of Whites are Christian and 95% of [other race] are Christian it would still be a white majority, just not &quot;per capita&quot;. 100% of 100,000 is still a minority compared to 55% of 100,000,000.<p><i>>By restricting immigration, and not allowing the overall quotas to align with where the people otherwise qualified and interested in coming are located? Certainly.</i><p>This has nothing to do with race and more to do with a government, &quot;it&#x27;s people&quot;, and the effects of immigration on both of those. Your argument presumes that someone can be anti-immigration but &quot;pro-white immigration&quot;. As someone against immigration and pro-restrictive immigration, that&#x27;s a bit of an absurd and out-of-touch claim to be making. I&#x27;m equally against a &quot;qualified Irishman&quot; from immigrating as I am a &quot;qualified Indian&quot;.<p>Also what do you mean by &quot;overall quotas&quot;?<p>Open-borders also actively harms &quot;lesser-off&quot; countries: all their talent leaves for greener pastures. Leaving these countries with a lack of leaders and professional talent (ie. doctors). How do you value the interest of an individual over the well-being of an entire country? What if we simply took every single doctor out of India and let the people fend for themselves when it comes to health care? Should millions die so a few 10,000 could move to a &quot;better country&quot;? Immigration has harmful side-effects than I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re fully considering.<p>><i>Why would the whites holding the majority of the power oppose having greater non-white subject populations as long as they were still subject?

It doesn&#x27;t take a strategist to know that ruling over a minority that outnumbers you isn&#x27;t feasible and revolt is likely when you are outnumbered. (see: history)<p>The counterpoint is that whites are <i>not</i> uniformly racist because they <i>haven&#x27;t</i> created systems to guarantee a smaller non-white population than white population. If white people <i>were</i> uniformly racist, as you mentioned, they would have had systems in place to insure they remained the majority population in order to remain in control.<p><i>>Zimmerman is of white race and Hispanic ethnicity.</i><p>He&#x27;s of Hispanic race and Hispanic ethnicity.

You do have to tell customers the tax id of your LLC. Thus, the check may say John Doe, but the 1099 at the end of the year should not be issued to your SSN, it should be to the LLC&#x27;s tax number.\nc. YOu do need a business tax account\nd. You can elect to pay yourself yearly, and take most of the distribution as dividends rather than income---check with your accountant. In some states, they will insist you provide employment details every quarter anyway. This is a headache and you may want to use a payroll company or outsource this--that costs a few bucks. \ne. I am not an accountant, and not a legal expert. Just a guy who has had to deal with business issues. So please check everything with experts.\nf. In my opinion, liability prevention and tax advantages can accrue through this course of action, so you are on the right track.

Protein crystallization is a tricky process with many irreducible results. Yet if you have a crystal, and can use the crystal to determine the protein structure, then you can verify that the crystal indeed contains that protein - even if you are unable to reproduce the chemical process used to create the crystal in the first place.

9865243,comment,9864455,9865050,0,0,brightball,,,"Well, there&#x27;s a couple of reasons for it.<p>The main reason is that there is this idea of equal pay for equal work which only works if your work is producing widgets per hour. That&#x27;s fine on a manufacturing line, an hourly job, or a job where the variance in performance of a job isn&#x27;t measurably valuable to a business.<p>I&#x27;ve got a lot of experience as a programmer/devops guy, but if somebody hired me to setup Wordpress with a template for them I&#x27;m not really adding much more value than anybody else who could do the job. From the business perspective, they just want the site to be setup and look nice.<p>If a company is looking to hire a developer who can both develop the application, help manage the infrastructure and identify programming decisions that are going to cause a negative impact down the line...I&#x27;m going to add a lot more value for that business.<p>But...if my salary at that business was public and you could clearly see on paper that I made more money that another programmer on the team who really felt like he was contributing just as much it&#x27;s going to cause resentment. The only way to clear up that resentment is for somebody to sit down with said guy and say, &quot;Look, this guy does X, Y and Z and has experience and a track record of identifying problems and preventing us from making expensive mistakes. His salary is based on the value proposition. You are focussed on an area of programming for the app and you do a great job with it.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s no way to explain it without causing resentment, having another person constantly having to justify themselves, or backhandedly belittling the contributions of another person.<p>This is essentially why people don&#x27;t talk about it. Because nobody thinks their work isn&#x27;t as valuable or their contributions are as valuable as the most valuable people at the company...and they have no way of understanding that without actually doing those people&#x27;s jobs.<p>There&#x27;s not a PC way to say &quot;there&#x27;s no such thing as equal work&quot; unless your job is so specific, so thoroughly defined and so repetitive that anybody can be plugged in to perform the tasks...and at that point your job doesn&#x27;t have much value anyway.",1436548123

It&#x27;s so common to hear people complain about how their chosen Internet communities aren&#x27;t like they used to be- everyone used to be so thoughtful, now it&#x27;s just a bunch of precocious kids flaming each other over dumb things. I remember feeling the same way about Usenet circa 1996, or Slashdot circa 2000.<p>Constructive, productive communities are very tenuous things and I think there&#x27;s just a natural entropy that happens as they grow where the tone of the conversation gets watered down, snarkiness and flames beget more snarkiness and flames, the more mature community members get annoyed and stop participating, and after a while it&#x27;s just a bunch of people who don&#x27;t know what they don&#x27;t know screaming at each other about which phone/language/Linux distro/whatever they use.<p>It&#x27;s tempting to attribute this to the profession as a whole (&quot;my fellow developers used to be interesting, now they&#x27;re all jerks!&quot;), but I think it&#x27;s more just the inevitable deterioration someone sees if they go to the same forums or stay on the same mailing lists for a few years. It might also be due to the observer getting more mature and clueful and picking up on negatives that have always been present in those communities, but previously unnoticed. Back in 1995 I really put Usenet on a pedestal, but that&#x27;s partially because I was way more immature and thought many of the other posters were far more insightful than they actually were. In other words, it may seem like everyone else has become really clueless and immature but part of that could just be you, the observer, becoming more experienced and mature.",1436547973

9865180,comment,9864074,9864693,0,0,mikeash,,,"That doesn&#x27;t happen. There&#x27;s a trip energy graph which shows your projected remaining charge when you reach your destination, and compares it with the actual usage. Energy use is strongly dependent on speed, so if you find yourself using more than projected, you can slow down a bit (5MPH is generally plenty) and get back on track. If you use more than expected you can see this happening with plenty of time to spare and take appropriate actions without any worries.<p>One of the nice things about an electric car is that the measure of remaining capacity is really accurate. In a typical gas car, anything below ~50 miles of range is basically a crapshoot. In an electric car, if it says you can make it 5 more miles, that might actually be 4, or 6, but it won&#x27;t be zero.<p>I don&#x27;t know what happened with the author, but given the total lack of discussion of the trip energy use graph in the article, I suspect he was not using all the tools available to him and misinterpreted something. That&#x27;s not to make excuses for Tesla; they seriously need to improve their trip planner to stop being so stupid. However, if you take five minutes to familiarize yourself with the car and the tools it provides you, then there is no worry about the battery suddenly jumping to -22% and leaving you stranded. It&#x27;s <i>certainly</i> not an &quot;inevitable occasion.&quot;",1436547645

Developers needing specific behavior for this pattern could easily have used java.nio.CharBuffer which makes allocation/copying/access to the underlying array/etc explicit, and just happens to implement CharSequence.  No reimplementation of String necessary.<p>In general, Java is not C or C++, and has never been billed as a platform where you could rely on the internal representation of anything unless it is specified as such.  Even the same bytecode running on the same platform on the same machine can run differently if the hotspot compiler says Make It So.  That of course assumes you are even using Oracle&#x27;s JVM or OpenJDK... there are in fact other implementations of both the JVM and the standard library that are free to implement things however they want.<p>Even within the Oracle/OpenJDK sphere - there are 4 different garbage collectors which all could affect this pattern differently.  There is even a new String dedup feature that would have an impact on the internal behavior of Strings:<p><a href=""https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2014/08/string-deduplication-new-feature-java-8-update-20-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2014/08/string-deduplication-...</a><p>tl;dr - don&#x27;t assume and pick the right tool for the job",1436547638

7951775,comment,7951082,7951559,3,0,sheepmullet,,,"It sounds like releasing daily is part of your testing strategy in that you simply let your customers do the testing for you.<p>Making small incremental changes with extensive manual testing can work. It just looks like you don&#x27;t have to pay for the test effort.<p>I&#x27;ve seen it a fair bit with internal projects at larger companies but most external customers I have met in my career would quickly switch products.<p>Edit: It also sounds like you are confusing best practices with good code. I&#x27;ve met teams, usually without a formal cs education, who haven&#x27;t used version control and didn&#x27;t have any unit tests, but still had a well designed codebase.

7951757,comment,7951420,7951663,4,0,jonnathanson,,,"Or the reverse: caving in and picking an Icelandic first name, but keeping Harriet as the middle name, and calling her Harriet in everyday circumstances.<p>I&#x27;m not an expert in Icelandic by any stretch, but I think the problem here is that names are used in declensions in everyday speech. Which means that &quot;Harriet&quot; isn&#x27;t painless, from a linguistic point of view. It sort of &quot;breaks&quot; the language. It returns an error, so to speak.<p>This is an imperfect analogy, but imagine if I were to name my son &quot;Michael&#x27;s.&quot; Not &quot;Michael,&quot; but &quot;Michael&#x27;s,&quot; which is essentially a possessive tense. That would create some odd headaches in certain conversational and written contexts. It&#x27;s hard to understand from the perspective of English, because in most cases, we don&#x27;t use declensions in proper nouns. In theory, you could probably force Icelandic to work around foreign words and names, just as English has worked around and incorporated foreign words and names. But English has a long history of doing that, and the population of English speakers worldwide is enormous and heterogeneous.<p>I&#x27;m opposed to the Icelandic Naming Committee&#x27;s position here. Seems they could stand to be a little more flexible, and/or to recognize that this inflexibility breeds more inflexibility, recursively. But I guess that&#x27;s their goal. Linguistically, they are extremely conservative and would prefer their language remain static. English is pretty much the opposite: unregulated, as it were, and constantly evolving.",1403819660

7951736,comment,7950102,7950102,5,0,warfangle,,,"> &quot;What about load times and performance?!?!&quot;<p>If you&#x27;re rendering everything on the client like that, how many HTTP requests are you making, other than the initial 3 (stylesheet + javascript + html document)?<p>I&#x27;m especially focusing on mobile performance, here. On 3G you have 200-2500ms latency on the control plane, 200ms latency for dns lookup, 200ms latency on establishishing a tcp connection, your TLS handshake will have a latency anywhere from 200-400ms and the actual http request will have a latency of 200ms.<p>That&#x27;s 1000-2900ms per http request, minus 100 if your client can cache DNS responses (and everything is on the same domain). Sometimes these will be multiplexed. You can&#x27;t count on it though. 4G is only marginally better: you have an overhead of 240-500ms on 4G.<p>And none of that takes into account the time it takes your server to process a request, or the time it takes for the client to parse and execute your rendering codebase.<p>If you&#x27;re aiming for sub-1000ms request-to-glass, you can&#x27;t follow the advice of this book (don&#x27;t render anything on the server ever) - unless you don&#x27;t mind the client showing a loading animation for the 2-15 seconds it&#x27;ll take to load your &quot;app.&quot;<p>(good luck with that mobile bounce rate)<p>0. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Il4swGfTOSM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Il4swGfTOSM</a>",1403819238

I&#x27;ve seen similar positions from other scientists. The odd thing is that if there&#x27;s a scientist who&#x27;s of the opinion that <i>their</i> science is the only one that&#x27;s important or true, it&#x27;s usually a physicist. I haven&#x27;t seen a biologist or chemist or the like take this position. Strangely, I have seen it from a psychologist.<p>I found the context of the article to be more talking about philosophy the field with occasional mentions of philosopher the occupation. In any case, I haven&#x27;t read a lot of stuff from 20th C occupational philosophers - but it was talking to a philosopher that opened my eyes to the seeds of questioning my own stigma of the field. That lead me to more investigation of the methods and histories and reasoning of why we do science the way we do, and realising that understanding the process means you know why you&#x27;re doing it that way, and where you can appropriately modify your methods<p>For example, I&#x27;ve butted heads here on HN before with people who think that the only way to &#x27;do science&#x27; is with a null hypothesis and a double-blind trial. For some cases in medicine, this isn&#x27;t possible (usually due to both low n <i>and</i> ethics), so case studies are used. Case studies are recognised as not being as robust and subject to a number of caveats, but they still give us knowledge that can be used to make predictions and repeatable actions. Keep in mind the caveats, and you&#x27;re drawing from a valuable pool of knowledge. The difference here is understanding what you&#x27;re trying to get (robust, repeatable data, preferably published), rather than having a golden method that is the One True Thing and any departure from it is straying from the right path.<p>But back to the question of what occupational philosoph<i>ers</i> have given to society recently, I don&#x27;t know. But philosoph<i>y</i> has given us astounding amounts, including most of the egalitarian and civil rights advances we&#x27;ve seen. I get the impression that occupational philosophers &#x27;keep the flame alive&#x27;, and that their work infiltrates other fields via philosophy fans in those fields. Certainly for physics and science in general, most of the philosophical problems have been solved, though there are still some hanging about, like how do we define consciousness? In order to study it, we need good definitions, and this one eludes us with great agility - philosophical discussions on this at least help nail down what it isn&#x27;t.",1403818354

It&#x27;s mature enough that you can find cheap textbooks for it. Microfluidic assays (which can be combined, like circuits, on a silicon chip) for every conceivable metric of interest have been developed, debugged, and sold to incumbent diagnostics companies. It was only a matter of time before someone integrated them, but the &quot;usual suspects&quot; were tripped up by market kinetics:<p>No academic group has been sufficiently capitalized to pursue an &quot;Integrate All The Assays&quot; (IATA) project. A lab typically pursues 2 or 3 assays at a time, which they will often integrate into a &quot;µTAS&quot; which is academic slang for IATA but should get its own term because typical µTASs measure 2 or 3 things which is far below the potential of the technology (what I&#x27;m terming &quot;IATA&quot;).<p>Industrial groups that were in a position to go IATA already had hard-won silos in the payola+bundling ridden rat&#x27;s nest of the medical supply industry. They wanted to keep those (payola+bundling = low competition and high margins) and they didn&#x27;t want to fight the war-on-many-fronts that would arise if they tried to invade everyone else&#x27;s silos at once. The big risk is that their competitors in every silo could undercut/outmaneuver them in individual silos faster than they could weave a political network to unify purchasing across silos.<p>Well, now someone has figured out how to do just that. Strategy: lots of money, lots of connections, and a killer entry strategy. It&#x27;s all in the execution, as always.<p>Two interesting questions to keep in mind as this plays out:<p>1. Now that someone has gone IATA, will the medical device supply industry become truly competitive again? I think there&#x27;s a nonzero chance of that happening. That would be a dream come true for consumers and medtech startups alike.<p>2. How much of the proceeds will filter back to the people who actually developed the technology? Obviously the answer will be &quot;a teeny tiny fraction,&quot; but the amount in absolute terms will be an important indicator (to me, personally, and I suspect others) as to how well the patent system works in this sector. Will it be like the software sector (patents discourage implementation AND don&#x27;t encourage innovation) or will it be like the drug sector (patents function more or less as they were intended albeit with the caveat that a lion&#x27;s share of the proceeds flows, as it always does, to capital)?",1403818313

The fact that there is a minimum wage, and that many earn just that, is a clear indication that the market price of labor isn&#x27;t negotiated between parties of equal strength.<p>To be clear: regardless of who sets the minimum wage, there is a minimum wage, and you aren&#x27;t free to take a job under that level. To be honest, it would seem easier to &quot;control&quot; the union of which you are a member, than to adjust the minimum wage. It&#x27;s just two organizations where one (congress/parliament) feels larger and further away.<p>A huge drawback of a single minimum wage (not differing between different parts of the labor market) is that it will spel trouble for companies when businesses on different parts of the cycle would be treated the same.\nAs an example, here companies relying on export such as truck makers are hugely sensitive to drops in global economy, and unions will accept frozen wages to limit layoffs as soon as bad times hit, which it does early in the cycle. Meanwhile service jobs or the public sector may be at a completely different point in the economy cycle, with perhaps 1-2 years before bad times hit. To use the same wages in both parts of the labor market would be a rather blunt solution.",1403818180

Perhaps software quality was not the 1st but actually the 2nd or 3rd reason why the company failed.  I&#x27;m not saying such examples of software execution killing the company don&#x27;t exist. I just can&#x27;t think of any prominent examples at the moment.<p>I&#x27;m leaving out poor software examples such as the Atari 2600 E.T Extra Terrestrial game cartridge because that was not a startup situation.[1]<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial_(video_game)#Critical_response"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial_(vid...</a><p>On the other hand, an internet company like Friendster looks like an interesting case study.  Their infrastructure software was not efficiently traversing their social graph.  It was something Facebook programmers conquered but Friendster did not.  But was software quality the #1 reason behind Friendster&#x27;s demise?  Apparently, the board-of-directors didn&#x27;t prioritize and throw money at the engineering challenges that Friendster was facing.[2]  So the their failure can be reinterpreted as a combination of management of priorities and software execution.  Maybe if they did throw money at the issue, it wouldn&#x27;t have mattered because their programming staff didn&#x27;t have the unique competencies to tackle at-scale social graph problems.  In that case, it&#x27;s not a &quot;technical debt&quot; issue but a &quot;hiring talent&quot; issue.<p>[2]<a href=""http://highscalability.com/friendster-lost-lead-because-failure-scale"" rel=""nofollow"">http://highscalability.com/friendster-lost-lead-because-fail...</a><p>Another case study might be the Chandler software (chronicled in the book &quot;Dreaming in Code&quot;).  However, it appears that the product got bogged down by architecture astronauts unable to make decisions and not &quot;technical debt&quot;.<p>If there are thousands of companies that failed on software quality, it&#x27;d be interesting to see which ones can be disentangled from non-software issues and we can confidently say, &quot;<i>yep, that technical debt is what killed them.</i>&quot;<p>(My curiosity for real examples does not mean I&#x27;m endorsing technical debt.

7951632,comment,7951324,7951324,10,0,tptacek,,,"Ouch. The bug here is simple. The LZO format has a block type for uncompressable data (&quot;literal runs&quot;). LZO implementations (all the ones Don Bailey looked at) keep a counter associated with literal runs that count NUL (00h) bytes. The counter can be made to grow quickly and eventually overflows. The LZO codecs Bailey looked at use that counter for a copy, and thus have a memory corruption flaw.<p>It&#x27;s likely that anything you use that decompresses LZO (MPEG files are a good example) uses C code to do it, and not code in a higher-level language.<p>So you&#x27;d want to know any place your application accepts a file format that can use LZO, because that might be a potential memory corruption flaw in your application regardless of the language you built it in.<p>Memory corruption flaws are very bad; these are the bugs that often result in attackers being able to upload code to your server that is then executed. That vulnerability, once triggered on your site, is probably game-over for your whole data center/deployment environment.<p>This flaw won&#x27;t be as easy to exploit as the Rails YAML bug will be, but to the extent that your code reuses a well-known LZO codec, there may be shrink-wrap exploits available soon.",1403818078

7951580,comment,7951494,7951494,3,0,nostrademons,,,"I generally recommend that new devs who don&#x27;t yet know what they want to specialize in learn front-end dev first and then work their way backwards.<p>The reason is that frontend skills are widely transferrable between companies, and qualify you for a large number of jobs.  This means that you can get your foot in the door at a lot of different places, and if you don&#x27;t like it, you can switch to another company or product really easily.  Once you find a specialty, <i>then</i> you can start learning backend technologies in depth, and probably switch roles within the company.<p>Backend technologies are often surprisingly tightly tied to a particular problem domain.  Yes, familiarity with SQL and an RDBMS will help you in a lot of places.  However, many of the more interesting places to work need graph databases, high-performance timeseries stores, memory caches, bloom filters, flat file formats, and a large number of custom technologies.<p>And when it comes to data <i>analysis</i>, your effectiveness is largely dependent upon how familiar you are with the particular data set you are analyzing.  I saw wizards work wonders with Google&#x27;s corpus of news articles; they could really quickly machine-learn models from the corpus, even for totally new products, because they&#x27;d been working with the data set for the last 10 years.  However, while there are some general techniques that most data extraction & prediction problems use, that wizardry wouldn&#x27;t translate to, say, protein folding.  Backend data processing is much less transferrable between different sets of data.<p>The flip side is that domain-specific knowledge tends to last much longer than frontend technologies.  Typically, you have to learn a new frontend technology every 5-10 years; I started my career in 2000 and have already had to jump from Java Swing to static webpages to single-page webapps to mobile technologies.",1403816868

Similarly I guess to the stories about how the Obama elections team worked. Deploying a small group of devs with a battle group, who have for purpose to write custom software to make the battle group more efficient. By participating in the pre-deployment training and exercise, the devs could familiarize themselves with the most important tools that need to be created for the deployment. Then while deployed, polish the rough edges and adapt the tools to new situations.<p>Otherwise, going through the procurement chain of the army will inevitably lead to insanity and bad software, and no actionable result.

Then you can ask questions like &quot;What is the likelyhood that a given individual has experienced an inflation rate that differs significantly from the reported rate? (either positively or negatively)&quot;<p>Charts like <a href=""http://www.city-data.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.city-data.com/</a> which can show you housing pricing changes by city for example you can see the wide disparity in changes between coastal vs more central states. Some states would have experienced very little change, others quite a bit. Now overlay that on population. Then you start to get to the answer of &quot;What do &#x27;most&#x27; people&#x27; experience in terms of inflation.&quot; The newspaper archive is a great way to check the numbers.<p>Thanks again for the links, one of the criticisms for the CPI scale has always been this : <i>&quot;The CPI follows the prices of a sample of items in various categories of consumer spending—such as food, clothing, shelter, and medical services—that people buy for day-to-day living.&quot;</i><p>Which historically did not include changes in quantity. So a &#x27;can of soup&#x27; which went from $1.00 -> $1.25 over 10 years seems like it has a 25% increase in cost, but it went from 16 -> 10 ounces. Which means its actual cost went from $1.00 -> $2.00 when computing the per ounce price. This is another great thing you can see/check with newspaper archives as grocery prices are exceptionally well documented.",1403816699

I believe this is due to licensing, and if it is, it&#x27;s a really prime example of licensing rules having absurd consequences.<p>In another region, the shows in the language of the region where you pay come with subtitles in the region&#x27;s native language(s) that <i>can&#x27;t be turned off</i> in a pleasant way through the UI. It <i>can</i> be done via a hack where you can provide the player with your own custom, empty, subtitles file, but this has to be reloaded for each new episode / movie that you play. It took me a good while to figure out how to do this via forums, it&#x27;s certainly not something Netflix suggest or encourage, or even seemingly acknowledge, in their help sections.<p>A related problem is that for shows not in the language of the region where you pay, there aren&#x27;t any subtitles in your language, even though back in the region where you pay, that same show is available, of course with subtitles in your language.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s Netflix themselves, or draconian licensing conditions that lead to this absurdity, but I suspect the latter as with Netflix&#x27;s own shows, the problem doesn&#x27;t exist.

However, it seems very interesting, that as much as we like to differentiate ourselves we also tend to some kind of collectivism (e.g. trending sports, technology (iPhone/Android), etc.), even working for the same corporations (Google/Facebook/Apple...) which also appears contrary to the article. It may be true that the speed of change is accelerating but I can&#x27;t agree with the idea that we already reached a fully fragmented society (yet) which is here to stay.<p>Another interesting part was the analogy to Ford&#x27;s vertical integration. The trend definitely went from fully integrated mega corps to fragmented networks of corporations. The car industry is a perfect example. It would be exciting to know if PG thought about Tesla/SpaceX and it&#x27;s current move towards a higher level of integration (producing more and more parts by themselves) in order to control the quality of their products. It may be sign that we are on the edge or maximum of fragmentation and there are trends emerging which pull us back into consolidation (maybe in another form than it used to).",1451842955

By definition lots of people are coming up with SaaS solutions for AWS, etc, because it is absolutely not bleeding edge anymore.

Uber sounds like an obvious idea now, requiring little technical wizardry (at least to get the idea going).

Wrapping containers in an easily understandable cli and making them mutable through a secure daemon API required a lot of technical acumen to accomplish.

There&#x27;s some good information in this thread about why (freebsdgirl&#x27;s reply, for instance), but there are other reasons.  Dealing with law enforcement can make a problem much, much worse; google around for the experiences that victims of sexual assault have when dealing with police and the courts.  Reporting crimes like this can also get you blacklisted as an &quot;HR problem&quot;.  Victims sometimes blame themselves.  Reporting a crime is a huge time and money sink.  Statements, testimony, attorney&#x27;s fees... it all piles up (and don&#x27;t forget about the wage gap!).  Again I&#x27;m only scratching the surface, but there are fundamental problems with the criminal justice system that need to be resolved before &quot;just call the cops&quot; is an adequate recourse.<p>> What many people now know as safe places, however, overreach their stated goal of providing security for minorities.<p>But what I think you mean is that you think it&#x27;s too easy to experience disproportionate consequences for violating a safe space, for example Brendan Eich was forced to resign after his donations to an anti-same-sex-marriage campaign came to light.  I&#x27;m guessing you feel like that was unjust: Eich was exercising his right to free speech, and he lost his job (one could argue it was more than just a job for him).<p>It&#x27;s not unjust.  Besides the fact that everyone who pressured Eich to step down was exercising their own free speech (blog posts, board resignations, public opinion campaigns, browser boycotts), all opinions are not valid political views, and not all political views are equal or even acceptable.  For example, some people believe that all first-born children should be male, and all female fetuses should be aborted until a male child is born.  If any CEO donated to a campaign supporting this cause, they&#x27;d likely lose their position, as it&#x27;s pretty reprehensible.<p>Being racist, or homophobic, or transphobic, or misogynistic, or bigoted in general, is also reprehensible.  It always has been.  The friction here is that these attitudes are deeply entrenched in our culture; it takes time to clean them up, and people who are slow to change their attitudes are experiencing serious consequences for things that used to be completely acceptable (yet, importantly, still reprehensible).  Victims of these attitudes rightly have no patience with this effort: their whole lives they&#x27;ve been oppressed for who they are, and their oppressors hide behind &quot;free speech&quot;, and &quot;well that&#x27;s just my opinion&quot; while minorities labor under the disparate impact caused by large numbers of relatively powerful people holding these beliefs.  For example, 40% of managers admit to avoiding hiring women of childbearing age because they might use maternity benefits.  That creates a bias against women that goes far beyond free speech and opinion.<p>The state constantly has to balance everyone&#x27;s rights.  There are tons of examples: free speech vs. harassment; freedom of religion vs. freedom from religion; liberty vs. safety (you have to get a license to own a gun or drive a car, etc.).  You&#x27;re arguing that, along the free speech vs. harassment continuum, safe spaces go too far to protect minorities from harassment, balancing the right to be bigoted against the right to feel safe and not be discriminated or prejudiced against.  You need to take a closer look at the current state of things, because we&#x27;re far, far away from &quot;overreach&quot; on this issue.  Minorities continue to experience wildly disproportionate levels of harassment, physical violence and injustice.  Over 80% of sexual harassment claims are made by women.  African-American men are far overrepresented in our prisons.  The wage gap between white men and white women, men of color and women of color is real.  LGBT people face the threat of violence and discrimination every day.<p>> If you force someoen to empathize, they aren&#x27;t truly empathizing, they are remaining quiet for fear of being called a bigot and getting their reputation ruined.<p>If someone does not empathize with the minority experience in the US, they&#x27;re either ignorant or a bigot.  You can dislike the facts, but you can&#x27;t disagree with them.",1451841267

10831271,comment,10822777,10829490,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"&quot;You&#x27;re obviously more in tune with the project than I am. I never worked at Intel, but a lot of my friends did (mostly in implementation rather than architecture).&quot;<p>Nah, I just read the Wikipedia articles, the chapter from the capability systems book, and the other papers I linked. I&#x27;m digging history out piece by piece like anyone else.<p>&quot;As for Colwell&#x27;s critique, Intel must have liked it so much that they hired him. :) I attended a number of Colwell&#x27;s public presentations on various x86 chips, and he seemed like a smart, approachable, down-to-earth guy.&quot;<p>Oh hell! Didn&#x27;t know he got hired. That&#x27;s cool. Good to hear that about his character, too, because that makes him a worthwhile consultant on clean-slate chips if he&#x27;s still alive and in the field.<p>&quot;So I&#x27;m sure there was lots of internal politics going on at Siemens also.&quot;<p>Politics and trying to do everything at once from what I gather. Along with picking safe languages like Ada again with market rejection. Gotta at least support whatever is popular. Additionally, there was the backward compatibility effect: need to virtualize prior ISA so apps aren&#x27;t thrown away. IBM&#x27;s capability system (System/38->AS/400) was doing that while Intel&#x27;s didn&#x27;t.<p>So, a number of reasons these things failed.<p>&quot;One other thing that confuses me with various wiki entries of all this is that Wiki mentions Fred Pollack more prominently, whereas the name I heard more was Justin Rattner.&quot;<p>That is weird. Someone should try to get to the bottom of that sometime. Meanwhile, a quick Google led to this:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rattner"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rattner</a><p>Tells us little but notice that the patents&#x27; functionality correspond to subsystems of i432. The first 3 at least because the 4th is ambiguous. He could&#x27;ve been one of the bright HW people on the team coming up with the tech while Pollack led the project.<p>&quot;perhaps something more architecturally advanced should be considered. Who cares if it&#x27;s only 25% of the performance of the x86. The tradeoffs in terms of security etc might make it worth while. At least for high reliability applications.&quot;<p>You see, I agree but they&#x27;ve tried and failed this before. The only one you didn&#x27;t link was Itanium: the third attempt to clean-slate CPU&#x27;s for higher performance, reliability, and security. Itanium had enough RAS features for use in mainframe-style SMP systems and its security features <i>could have</i> been used for very secure systems. One company did with its CTO being the Itanium designer probably having something to do with that. ;)<p><a href=""https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/intel-itanium-secure-white-paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/docum...</a><p>Anyway, VLIW part and disconnect from legacy meant little uptake despite around $200 million spent. At this point, Intel may have been burned too many times by the market to try too hard. The next step is to go for the legacy + accelerator model which has paid off for them with GPU&#x27;s and custom instructions. Dedicated hardware or onboard FPGA&#x27;s can give a performance boost while supporting legacy app.<p>I&#x27;d also consider mixing clean-slate and legacy CPU&#x27;s in the same system where legacy app can run on one with accelerators running on other with smooth, function-call-level integration. They could have the same endianess, ABI, data-types, etc to make it easier. The rest is different for better parallelism, less bloat, enhanced security (eg pointer protection), fault-tolerance, and so on.<p>Many possibilities but Intel will be careful given billions invested in nothing so far.",1451840928

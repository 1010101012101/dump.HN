There's something buried in here that I find fascinating.""</i><p>One wonders if the rise of markets, global communication, etc., have rendered the nation state somewhat obsolete.<p>In theory, we still depend on our governments for things like public works, for ensuring peace, for promoting justice, and protecting personal property. These are things that we believe corporations would be ill-suited for.<p>And yet, in practice, at least in the United States and in the PIGS of Europe--we see that hey, holy shit, they've dropped the ball in a lot of cases. I'm willing to wager that we wouldn't be too much worse off with a different system.<p>Note: I take this position not in support of our new corporate overlords, but out of the necessity born from the realities of our government. If our government actually helped the public, actually had a legal system that worked justly and fairly, and actually did Good, I'd shun the amorality of the free market. But it doesn't, so I can't.",1334779168

Everything is considered in terms of <i>aggregate demand</i>. The thing is, we don't have an aggregate demand problem in this recession: in aggregate, we're doing fine, and have been for some time. The problem is that we've got over-investment in some areas (like housing), and the need to shed that excess, and redirect it into sectors that have greater demand, is painful in any case. But the government's efforts to prop up housing costs is actually interfering with that process. And putting people to work on infrastructure projects as a stimulus doesn't do anything to help. Keynes's model assumes that demand (again, let me remind you that his terminology is ""aggregate demand"") is one homogeneous thing.<p>Second, inflation can't be used so effectively as a tool. Milton Friedman demonstrated pretty conclusively that such manipulations can't be effective, except in the very short term. The people aren't stupid, they can see that the government is inflating the currency, and then they take action to protect themselves from the losses that it would engender. The result is that the market will stymie the government's effort to benefit from inflation (not that the market will stop the inflation, but that it will interfere with any good that it might have done).<p>Further, inflation turns out to be a vehicle for redistributing wealth -- in the wrong direction. Before the inflationary pressure is felt, the first ones who get their hands on the new specie will enjoy its full value. And those people are the bankers. Do we want to make the banking sector the beneficiary of all that extra buying power?",1334778841

And because Lisp was so high-level, we wouldn't need a big development team, so our costs would be lower. If this were so, we could offer a better product for less money, and still make a profit. We would end up getting all the users, and our competitors would get none, and eventually go out of business. That was what we hoped would happen, anyway.</i>",1334778829

So James Cameron, Larry Page, and Eric Schmidt are starting a venture to mine asteroids. James Cameron recently dove to the deepest parts of the ocean in his own submersible. The launch of Elon Musk & SpaceX's Falcon 9 mission to the ISS is just around the corner. I know I've read about other famous people launching wildly ambitious projects, but I can't remember them at the moment.<p>This is just mind blowing to me. These are endeavors normally left to nation states. There's something buried in here that I find fascinating.<p>In the past, when these endeavors were carried out by nation states, all the baggage of bureaucracy was along for the ride. Fast forward to today, and you have individuals with the imagination and the means to dream big. It's possible to undertake something insane -- like mining asteroids -- on your own.<p>I'm left thinking about the way that Steve Jobs ran Apple. I don't intend to steal credit from all the hard work of the people at Apple, but Steve Jobs ran Apple in a way that stands in contrast to many other companies. The fulcrum of decision making was remarkably focused on a single point: him.<p>I don't know the end game for capitalism, but a lot of people believe that along the way to its downfall, there is a massive consolidation of wealth. The presumption is that these individuals will all be corrupt fat cats that enslave the masses.<p>What if it's the opposite? What if the people who end up with the wealth do great things with it? It's kind of like a bunch of micro-sized benevolent dictatorships, but the dictator is naturally selected through capitalistic means: successful individuals gather the wealth required to reach this role in society.",1334777811

Maybe I'm just getting old?<p>On the other hand if I'm not out of touch it seems like it could be a great time to step out of 'traditional' consumer tech and push on some of the 'new' things like 3D printing, robotics, computer vision, etc as well as seek out applications towards other industries (education, health, food, etc.)",1334777358

The web experience is much better and doesn't bother me much, except when I want to upload photos.<p>Also, the whole Facebook experience sucks on mobiles phones because Facebook was designed for desktop browsers and there are no easy ways out. The difference on mobile phones is that because of the small screen size the consumption of content has to be linear and the Facebook stream is anything but (unline Twitter or your SMS Inbox). To add salt to the injury, a big part of what forms the Facebook experience is made of Flash-powered games and shitty apps that weren't designed for small touch-screens.<p>Basically Facebook has gotten too big to turn around fast and redesign their experience around mobile phones. They may be able to pull it off, but I suspect that their strategy is to break Facebook on mobile phones in multiple apps.<p>A really big and important part of Facebook is sharing and seeing photos of other people. Google saw that and one thing that Google+ does well is the sharing of photos. Google Picasa was integrated with G+, so this means cheap storage for full-resolution pictures and a kickass desktop tool for managing big photo collections. Android also comes with Google Picasa integration by default, so whatever you upload on Picassa it ends up synchronized to your mobile phone (or vice-versa). Then the G+ interface is really slick; the mobile app is not too shabby and the web browsing experience is good (or was, there's something off about their redesign).<p>The bottom line is this ... those 40 million users may already be Facebook users, but I bet they aren't mobile Facebook users ;-)",1334777317

I'll save tptacek some time and quote liberally from the article:<p>""It's unclear why new legislation is needed to allow this kind of uncontroversial information sharing to occur. Network administrators and security researchers at private firms have shared threat information with one another for decades. And the law also allows information sharing between private firms and the government in many circumstances. For example, a private company is already free to notify the FBI if it detects an attempt to hack into its network.""<p>[...]<p>""The ""notwithstanding"" approach to cybersecurity is fundamentally flawed because it's almost impossible to predict which parts of US law might be effectively changed by the new law, or to prevent unintended consequences from unduly broad sharing. It would be far better for Congress to figure out which specific privacy laws (if any) prevent effective network security responses and explicitly reform those provisions.""<p>[...]<p>""Given the roaring success of the Internet's backlash against the Stop Online Piracy Act, CISPA opponents have an irresistable temptation to compare the two bills. Both bills represent attacks on the rights of Internet users, but the similarity largely ends there.<p>A better analogy is the 2008 FISA Amendment Act, which granted major telecommunications incumbents retroactive immunity for their participation in warrantless wiretapping and eliminated judicial oversight for a broad category of government surveillance. CISPA is likely to further erode the already weak legal restraints on government surveillance of Americans, and there's no meaningful judicial oversight of information shared under the ""cyber threat"" program.""",1334777189

(Exercise: try to code a solver for the ""Tower of Hanoi"" in Node.js that is really non blocking :-))<p>The Opa compiler cuts your code into chunks and makes it non-blocking by managing all the callbacks for you. (Technically, Opa compiles functions using a continuation-passing style.)<p>2) Consistency between code and data (using static types).\nOpa features a static type checker with (almost complete) type inference. Programmers can also declare typed MongoDB collections and build typesafe DB queries in the Opa syntax. In the end, consistency between code and data is statically ensured in the entire application (client code, server code, and database queries).<p>Needless to say, there exist no such things as script code or database code injections in Opa programs :)<p>3) Transparent protection against XSS attacks.\nMost frameworks are based on a templating system that sees XHTML values as a ""flat string with holes"". In this setup, the problem of choosing the right escaping function at insertion points is called ""context sensitivity"" and is generally considered very difficult to solve without hints from the programmer.\nIn Opa (as in Scala) XHTML and XML values are first class tree-based data structures. Inserting a string into a XHTML value will generate an automatic typecast and trigger the proper escaping function by default in a very predictable way.<p>In the end, I believe that Opa has the potential to be for V8+NodeJS what Scala+(Lift or Play) are to the JVM -- Opa being at the same time arguably simpler to use.<p>How does this all sound to you?",1334776863

The idea is that you should be able to write, say, an HTML canvas game as if you were running code on one machine, writing to a 2d framebuffer. But then how do you deploy it? If the clients are powerful enough (and there are no dependencies on server-side state), you can run it all client-side, as JS that implements the game and writes to the canvas.<p>Alternately, you can run everything server-side, except every time a framebuffer update is needed, you generate an AJAX call which triggers the appropriate canvas update, treating the client as just a remote framebuffer. But that can be way too high-latency, and not run <i>enough</i> on the client side. So instead you might want to put the data boundary somewhere between those two extremes. Ideally the compiler would figure out where, based on some kind of analysis (either static or from profiling data, or both) that tries to minimize latency problems and/or data transfer, and takes into account capabilities of the client and server.",1334776486

I'm not sure if that was a good decision. The law may not see it as theft but realistically, it seems like it to me.

Well, if I stole it and even made it publicly available but no one actually used it then that's not theft though in reality it'd be a scary prospect if I owned Coke as I'm sure someone would use that recipe.<p>Putting the law aside for a moment, doesn't it make sense that simply obtaining source code without permission is unethical but shouldn't be illegal so long as its never used without permission? The funny thing about code is that it falls into the area of ideas more than products but at the same time once it's used it does become property in a way. It's a tool but there are a lot of different ways to create any given tool as far as code is concerned.<p>It's like language.

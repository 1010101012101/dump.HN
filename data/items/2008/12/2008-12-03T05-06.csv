Anyone who passed would be considered a ""financial adult"" trusted to handle his own affairs with minimal government oversight. Those who hadn't passed would be protected from getting themselves into deep trouble.",1228283887

384066,comment,383781,383875,0,0,bokonist,,,"The crux of the problem was the rating agencies.  By law, regulated funds (insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds) can only invest in bonds that are rated ""investment grade"" by official rating agencies ( such as Moody's).  The rating agencies had two problems: 1) because they were given official status by law, they became less vigilant about guarding their reputation 2) instead of using a mix of statistics and personal judgment to rate bonds, they relied solely on models.  It's analogous to managing programmer performance by only counting lines of code written.  The banks found a way to game the algorithm ( slicing securities into tranches) and thus were able to sell massive quantities of very risky loans to big, regulated funds.<p>So you're right, it is the banks job to make sure the customer can afford the loan, and ordinarily a bank would never have made these subprime loans.  But in this situation, the banks were able to resell these super risky loans to regulated funds that were obligated by law to invest in them.  The result was disaster.",1228282761

Evolution is just the mechanism. It's well within human capacity to design evolving systems, so why couldn't an omniscient God do the same? And indeed, wouldn't this vastly simplify the process?</i><p>I personally don't wish to add any power to the whole ID ""debate"". But the point you raise is one that I have often thought about myself. It's only that certain groups need to hold to the bible as the ""inerrant word of God"" (the earth is ~5000 years old, dinosaurs did not exist and obviously fossils were planted by God to test our faith, Adam was created first and then Eve from his rib bone etc.) that makes them fail to realise exactly this: Evolution could fit into their world view (slightly adjusted) as the mechanism put in place by their ""intelligent designer"".",1228282658

That would be the case if the legal costs, repair costs and above all medical costs of an accident were enormous. Like it is in the US.<p>But no, in India the government will bail you out if you get in a road accident. They do that by providing free healthcare, maintaining low fines, leaving glaring legal loopholes for your convenience and in most cases keeping motor mechanics in a low income tax exempt category, so you can fix your vehicle for dirt-cheap.<p>Hence you don’t care if a terrible driver is permitted to drive. Neither does society at large.<p>Strong economies are driven by the duality of strong incentives and costly penalties. Weak ones are undone by cultural and economical ecosystems built solely for saving each other’s ass.",1228281741

So that would make a few assumptions:<p>1) Advertising could be done on a wider scale and more targeted (not just one class) making it more profitable<p>2) Once a well established system and relationships are made with advertisers they would make much more money per ad<p>3) In order for the school to remain competitive, they would need more resources to provide a better service,  giving them an incentive to maximize revenue.<p>Based on that scenario it doesn't seem that unreasonable.",1228281284

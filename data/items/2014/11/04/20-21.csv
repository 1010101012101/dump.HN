Merely paying attention to something and expressing an interest can be hugely rewarding without needing to praise.<p>The flip side of this is why parents who have busy schedules for one reason or another often have kids with behavioral issues; the only reliable way for the kid to get attention is to piss off their parents.",1415134794

In the sense that I feel like our government just kind of makes stuff up as it goes along and only occasionally responds well to the strongest forms of shame.<p>In 2010 the Obama administration added an American citizen (Anwar al-Awlaki) to the CIA kill list, circumventing all due process. In a year they were able to strike and kill him with with a drone. They also hunted and killed his son, a 16-year-old US citizen, a couple of weeks later.<p>The Obama Administration, when challenged, claimed that it has the right to kill in &#x27;dire situations requiring an immediate action to save lives&#x27;. However, they were not able to provide, for al-Awlaki or his son, evidence that there was such an immediate threat. First it&#x27;s an absurdity because they hunted him, and had him on a kill list, for a year. Furthermore, the US had tried a drone strike on al-Awlaki before but missed. In this case there is no question that there was no immediate threat.<p>Finally al-Awlaki is not known to have participated in any violent action. Rather he was a radicalizer. As an imam, he preached about Islam and about the West. He was popular online (some called him the &#x27;Osama Bin Laden of the internet&#x27;) where he would exercise free speech (however extremist) but US government partnership with online companies such as Youtube were able to mostly silence him.<p>al-Awlaki&#x27;s father even tried - before his son was killed - to get him removed from the kill list. But he was blocked in court.<p>You mention MLK. There are some parallels - his carrying a radical message and evangalizing others, and his status as a religious and spiritual leader. I do not mean to draw equivalence - only analogy.<p>Because I wonder what would happen to the next MLK. If al-Awlaki is any precedent then I worry that our guarantees of a fair and speedy trial - jury of peers and all of that - won&#x27;t be respected when it isn&#x27;t convenient.<p>As an addendum I&#x27;d like to note that we&#x27;re seeing more of this. Snowden is allowed to come home and face trial - on the condition (imposed by the US government) that it is not a trial by a jury of peers.",1415134533

8558944,comment,8556935,8558451,0,0,owenmarshall,,,"> Let me put it this way - name a couple of open design issues with the current Telegram protocol.<p><a href=""https://core.telegram.org/img/mtproto_encryption1.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://core.telegram.org/img/mtproto_encryption1.png</a><p>The use of encrypt and MAC is the one that should jump out at even a crypto neophyte.<p>There are some nice proofs around this[1] that I&#x27;ve read before. The important one is that encrypt then MAC guarantees INT-CTXT: it&#x27;s computationally infeasible to produce a ciphertext not before sent by the sender. INT-CTXT implies INT-PTXT which is the weaker claim but typically the one people associate with the function of a MAC: that you can&#x27;t forge a plaintext the sender never sent.<p>While E&M isn&#x27;t immediately bad it has been used as an avenue for attack[2]. If Telegram&#x27;s aes_ige_decrypt() function accidentally overflows a buffer... and because they&#x27;re doing E&M it <i>must</i> call aes_ige_decrypt() on whatever message I decide to send it.<p>Now, Telegram can claim that those attacks don&#x27;t apply because of their use of IGE, and they may very well be correct! But then we move into IGE: there are known attacks that show chosen error introductions can cause the stream to resynchronize without error[3]. What does that mean in practice? Who knows: we know IGE is broken, but we don&#x27;t know how badly because no one actually studies IGE, or knows how it is implemented in this system!<p>The real failings here: Telegram uses a MAC with less security guarantees AND a cipher mode that would be charitably described as anonymous, instead of using a provably secure MAC along with well-studied modes.<p>Now, I&#x27;m a big security dummy (seriously) but if there&#x27;s one thing people far smarter than me have banged in my head, it&#x27;s this: you follow the well-beaten path precisely because it is well-beaten. When you start venturing off the trail into the woods of funky block cipher modes and known-problematic MAC modes, your margins get a lot thinner.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/oem.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/oem.pdf</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.thoughtcrime.org/blog/the-cryptographic-doom-principle/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thoughtcrime.org/blog/the-cryptographic-doom-prin...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sci.crypt/4bkzm_n7UGA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sci.crypt/4bkzm_n7UG...</a>",1415134030

A DB built for fast disk persistence would only update the relevant records, keeping the disk writes as small as possible. I don&#x27;t think Loki has any option other than writing the entire thing each time (with the current JSON savefiles, that is). Since save() is an expensive op, you also can&#x27;t be calling it at every update (it wouldn&#x27;t even work! the first one would lock the file for writing and all subsequent save() ops, until the first one is done, would fail!) so it would be inherently unsafe <i>unless you committed GBs to disk for each update!</i>.<p>So, this might be somewhat dangerous, but we can mitigate that, right? We&#x27;ll save frequently, but not too frequently, and somehow version-control our JSON file. Which is GB+ in size. So we&#x27;ll also compress them? And when we need to restore, we&#x27;d.. hmm.. start reading from the latest until a valid one is found? (<--inconvenience)<p>> Note, I&#x27;m really just dreaming here, and I appreciate you dreaming along.<p>Likewise!<p>> Sounds like there may be plenty of persistence schemes that make this not entirely painful (load latest data first, or fallback to disk reads if the data isn&#x27;t entirely loaded yet, which makes the service slower but still available right after a crash).<p>While those certainly exist, the one currently chosen by Loki can&#x27;t do any of these things. Since you can&#x27;t parse half a JSON file (especially in this format, which appends index info etc at the end of the file), you have to read the entire thing from disk, JSON.parse it, and then feed it into Loki. Only after all of that will you know that you are actually restoring from meaningful (and complete) data files and not junk.<p>The way I see this, it would be great for throwaway-prototypes on the serverside (or for few/unimportant data) but its real value would show on the client side. You basically get a mini-mongodb for 2K LOC that you can embed on anything that speaks ECMA3.<p>What&#x27;s even cooler IMHO is the future - on their slideshare presentation they list replication and horizontal scaling on their roadmap. While I have no idea how they have envisaged implementing those, I would love to experiment with the meteor.js concepts and this - providing a full, fast cache of the user&#x27;s data on the client side and then throw differential updates around.<p>edit: spelling",1415133120

Then, once they have spent the X years and $Y in opportunity costs to get a PhD, they have to figure out a career for themselves. This is a bad, not a good, thing. It reduces early-stage career experimentation and encourages low-quality science.<p>2) You don&#x27;t need to be smart to be a scientist; you need to be stubborn.<p>This is similar to the argument that ideas don&#x27;t matter for entrepreneurship. There are loads of theories and ideas in any given field about the way that things may be. What you need, as a minimum, is the ability to stick the course to figure out a way of testing those theories and ideas and do the (extraordinarily boring) legwork to get it done. I know a lot of scientists (physicists and mathematicians) and all of them are stubborn, but not particularly brilliant. 99% of physics and mathematics are made up of people who will do drudge work for years with very little recognition or reward. Very, very occasionally, one of them hits the jackpot.

As a policy matter we would never advocate building a project without codifying the process as zero-arg tasks in the build.boot file. You can see this in our own projects (eg. <a href=""https://github.com/tailrecursion/boot-useful/blob/master/build.boot"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tailrecursion/boot-useful/blob/master/bui...</a>). This project has one way to build the project jar file:<p><pre><code>    (deftask build-jar\n      &quot;Build project jar file.&quot;\n      []\n      (comp (pom) (add-src) (jar) (install)))\n</code></pre>\nWhen you build the jar file you just do<p><pre><code>    boot build-jar\n</code></pre>\nThis ensures repeatability, etc.<p>But we don&#x27;t only use boot for repeatable builds! Boot is in a unique position in that it&#x27;s on the intersection of application and environment. That is to say, boot can be used to &quot;bootstrap&quot; the application. With boot we can create sort of self-configuring applications, where the entry point of the application is the build.boot file.

And while the first line shows the flags, one could argue that without the version number for g++ you still don&#x27;t know what the compiler has done.  But in this case, it does seem that gcc-4.7 and gcc-4.8 both produce more less the code that you&#x27;d expect when compiling with -O2.<p>But to show that compiler behaviour is not just an idle worry, icpc 14.0.3 -O3 produces much faster times by realizing it can combine the loops and completely omit the reads.

Oh, it segfaults, because it tries to optimize to a 128-bit &#x27;movdqa&#x27; (Move Double-Quadword Aligned) that requires 16B alignment.<p>While unhelpful, I think it&#x27;s technically legal for it to do this, as (incredibly?) reading an unaligned int directly from memory is actually undefined behaviour.

8558730,comment,8556126,8556126,0,0,Joeri,,,"Interesting to think that complexity can be a result of trying to do proper software architecture. It occurs to me that the way software is typically built probably approaches the problem of complexity in software architecture from the wrong end. We try to build software systems that minimize complexity, have predictable behavior and operate under controlled conditions. Most software has extremely low tolerances for aberrant behavior.<p>Looking at biological systems though, that is the opposite of how reliable systems are constructed. If we design from the assumption of failure and runaway complexity, with watchdog and recovery processes, and using emergent behavior from small discrete components to obtain large-scale results, then we can build software components that are much better able to recover from unexpected interaction and produce more reliable systems. It seems to me that this is what the theory should be. I just have no idea how to do that in the real world when building a web app, aside from recycling server processes every now and then.",1415131268

2715903,comment,2715532,2715642,4,0,skroth,,,"I'm obviously in the minority here, but I don't feel their response was so bad. There are plenty of ""well-reasoned critiques that outline several important, thoughtful points"" of many companies on the internet. I think the fact that they responded at all is good. Remember Apple's response to the iPhone 4 issues? We (finally) got Jobs pointing the finger at other companies and trying to shift the attention.<p>Here RIM is admitting they're in some shit, and yes, they are only offering the typical response, but what else do you expect? That's not a rhetorical question. I'm genuinely curious how they could have responded that would make critics happy.<p>My thought is that the only thing they can do right now is promise action, which they did. Whether they follow through or not, I have no idea.<p>In response to your quoted text:\nI have no idea if the person really was an employee. I think people should take a neutral look at this instead of assuming one way or the other. On one hand, it could be an employee who has already talked to his colleagues about these issues and has been ignored. On the other hand, it's possible that it is just a bad media stunt by someone trying to bring negative attention to RIM or even trying to make some money with shorting them. If it's the former, I agree with you and would find this backpedalling immature. In the latter case I would agree with RIM and feel their response is appropriate.",1309471139

I've known for a long time that Facebook had near-identical groups functionality, but the interface is simply so painful to use that I barely even notice it. G+, on the other hand, has created a simple and intuitive privacy interface, and everything clearly shows who can see it.

We realized we're all seeing lots of amazing content, and increasingly having social experiences around that content every day - so we wanted to build a product that really reflected that - a place to discover cool content, and to comfortably share all of the interesting things you come across on the Internet.<p>We have many similarities to Reddit and HackerNews - except we are focused on people's real identities, and connections between their friends, and the experts in the topics they care about.<p>We are constantly tinkering with the formula of what makes something interesting - is it because it is controversial and there are many comments about it? Is it because a large number of people posted it too? Or is it enough that one of your friends, who is knowledgable about the topic, posted it? These are the questions that we are exploring and planning on answering by building The Shared Web.<p>But, there is something even more powerful that we realized as we were developing and using it. The sense of community and common context that is created when people that you know start seeing the same content as you. It makes for better conversations. That social engagement around content translates to discussions in different topics - its the evolution of old school forums. Its a way to make sure that the people you care about see the things that you find interesting so you can discuss them, so you can interpret them, so you can develop closer relationships by having common experiences. Thats what we hope to achieve with TSW, creating stronger, more meaningful connections between people through the content that they enjoy together.<p>Thats our mission. Thats why we are building The Shared Web.<p>What do you think are the most interesting heuristics to decide whether content is interesting to you or not?<p>We'd love to hear your thoughts, so please try out The Shared Web, tell us what you think help shape our vision: http://thesw.com/e1Eff5",1309470794

So, Zuck declared ""Lockdown"" for sixty days. ""Lockdown"" was a term from Facebook's early days, which meant when they had a serious competitor emerge at a particular school, they would stop everything and redouble their efforts until the new threat was gone.<p>This time, Lockdown meant removing all the obvious shortcomings from Facebook that Google could possibly beat us on. Since most of these were already in the pipeline, this meant shipping everything, now. For sixty days there was a constant fervor in the office, with fewer meetings, late(r) nights, and many people coming in on weekends. They even extended cafeteria hours.<p>The results of Lockdown were visible last fall, with the almost-monthly new product launches. New Messages (Titan), High-res photos, the new photo viewer, New Groups, Profile, and several other non-obvious additions were accelerated by Lockdown.<p>I think it is very indicative of the company's culture that their ""response"" was so pro-active.

It used to take me 10 - 15 minutes to get out of my car every morning just to walk inside.  I was able to use free work to transition from a boring career to one I enjoy in an incredibly short amount of time.<p>Rather than go back to school only to finish in debt and start at the bottom I was able to trade valuable work that I could do (finance/accounting) for experience in work that I wanted to do (development/data analysis).  I would always suggest short projects so as not to overwhelm either party, but this turned out to be very favorable in the long run.  \nOne major caveat is that these were not company created internships.  I wasn’t in the business of letting a company compile all of their shitty work only to pass it off on someone to do for free.  THAT IS WHAT NEEDS TO BE CALLED BULLSHIT ON.<p>If a job seeker shows just a little initiative they can force free work to have a training component that is defined in advance and one from which they will benefit.  Too many workers put their future in someone else’s hands by assuming the company has some training program mapped out for them.  Not surprisingly, these are exactly the types of employees who continue the cycle of useless and exploitative internships that you rail against.<p>If you are doing work for free, YOU are on the hook.

72245,comment,72231,72231,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Well, if I was to predict the future I would say that we will see new browser architectures that will allow new types of code to be written that are not currently possible. I think web browsers will be more like a VM that can run any kind of code compiled to them instead of being forced to render only HTML and JavaScript. I would take a look at the things about web development that people currently complain about and would venture to say that some smart people will get together and address them.",1193265174
72244,comment,72056,72235,0,0,mojuba,,,"Good point, but still, you can apply operator [] to a and b in some non-C dynamic language, which means the ""int a[]"" style is probably more relevant psychologically.",1193265127

72238,comment,72010,72010,0,0,DaniFong,,,"I heard from a math grad student at Princeton that there's some really weird drama behind Wolfram and some of his proofs.<p>Apparently someone working at Wolfram labs discovered a one dimensional, universal Turing equivalent cellular automata, announced it, and then tried to publish it under his own name. Wolfram apparently sued to keep him from ever speaking of the proof, but the court documents _included_ speaking to Wolfram about it.<p>So for about a year (or more?), there was a universal Turing machine, but no proof.<p>I guess this is a different machine, but it still seems really sketchy.",1193264632

72235,comment,72056,72216,0,0,Goladus,,,"The problem with the first one is that what you are declaring is effectively a const pointer named 'a' to 10 consecutive memory locations allocated for the size of int.  The second is a declaration of a variable-length array named a.<p>So, for example, you can't do this:<p><p><p><p><p><pre><code>       int a[10];\n       int b[10];\n\n       a=b;\n</code></pre>\nYou get a type error, or an lvalue error, because you can't assign anything to a constant.",1193264336
72234,comment,72190,72201,0,0,DaniFong,,,"I would suggest trying, nay, struggling, to learn to hack for a month or two. Learn a cool new language, like Ruby (it's actually easier than, 'production languages', but it's cooler). Make an effort to build things yourself. Put enough effort into the technical side so that you might be able to notice technical brilliance for yourself, and so that you can make informed decisions regarding hiring and project directions.",1193264287

Basically we'd like something which can (1) provide site traffic information on a slightly more real-time basis than Google Analytics, (2) help figure out which pages are taking a long time to render, or are heavily loading the database, and most importantly, (3) pull out any errors thrown by the code.

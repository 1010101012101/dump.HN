So yeah: I doubt most programs linked against OpenSSL are generating keys. Only processes that generate a key matter for the purpose of seeding entropy.<p>What, exactly, do you think your computer is generating so many new keys for during a routine boot process? Can you tell me what these new keys are for?<p>> Ditto for your claim that blocking for entropy is something that doesn&#x27;t happen or is trivial. It&#x27;s not, the kernel writers know.<p>Clearly it does happen: the question is how much does it happen; a desktop system generates enough entropy that it is easily capable of keeping up with generating enough random data from /dev/random to seed /dev/urandom every now and then because a new SSL-enabled daemon spawned.<p>> If you still believe you&#x27;re right, try to explain to the kernel writers how they can just initialize the urandom pool just once after the boot, and you solved the problem for everybody at once! You may even enter some hall of fame.<p>1) Apparently FreeBSD does this. Can you tell me how FreeBSD apparently does the impossible? 2) The kernel can clearly store a boolean; I mean, the kernel does all kinds of things only once... are you seriously thinking that the reason the kernel hasn&#x27;t implemented this is because they can&#x27;t?",1394229123

It makes sense to subtract times and get a timedelta, so you could define addition as the subtraction with signed times and signed timedeltas. So, since `time(today) - time(yesterday) = timedelta(1 day)`, we could say that `time(today) + time(yesterday) = -timedelta(1 day)` and `time(today) - -time(yesterday) = timedelta(1 day)`.

7362891,comment,7359992,7362641,1,0,saurik,,,"> You claim that only idiots beyond help will resort to working around /dev/random to prevent blocking. I disagree. I claim that any sufficiently frustrated developer will eventually go down that route if no other obvious choice is available.<p>The good workaround for /dev/random is trivial: you use /dev/urandom instead; if you are sufficiently frustrated that you hardcode /dev/random to a file of static data, you probably have made numerous other horrible mistakes. Yes: I maintain that this developer is an idiot who is &quot;beyond help&quot;; it is <i>harder</i> to make a static file for this than to use /dev/urandom.<p>This can also be a configuration file option: &quot;potentially blocks, but always works&quot; vs. &quot;will never block, but you&#x27;d better have setup your system correctly&quot;. Even better, the developer could go to steps to verify /dev/urandom is ready (such as reading from /dev/random and writing it to /dev/urandom) before using it receptively in ways that could block.<p>> I fear the assessment of the damage done by /dev/random blocking is understated.<p>When /dev/random blocks you know it happened, and a FAQ entry can guide you to a reasonable solution. (And again: given that you can apparently seed /dev/urandom from /dev/random, a solution that the advocates of /dev/urandom are still unhappy with for some reason, it seems like there&#x27;s no excuse to end up with /dev/random blocking; instead, what everyone should be encouraging is to seed /dev/urandom from /dev/random and then use /dev/urandom.)<p>Alternatively, the people who end up building systems that do not have enough entropy at boot have no way of knowing this happened, and are sufficiently divorced from what is being executed that they are unlikely to even realize that someone is relying on something they shouldn&#x27;t. This is where &quot;sane defaults&quot; come in: on Linux, it seems like software should not rely on /dev/urandom until the software proves somehow to itself that it is &quot;ready&quot;.",1394228262

Appliances built on it - now that&#x27;s more open to interpretation.<p>Back in 2003/2004 I was building a centrally managed security appliance system. At the time I made the hard choice that first-boot operations (such as generating long-term device keys) MUST use /dev/random. It made the initial installs take longer, but I refused to take the chance that an attacker could install and instrument a few hundred nodes and find out possible problems with entropy sources.<p>Once the first-boot sequence was over, applications used /dev/urandom for everything. This included the ipsec daemons. Forcing everything to /dev/random during first boot made sure that on subsequent boots there would be (for all practical purposes) enough entropy available for urandom to work securely.<p>The first-boot problems were amplified by the fact that we were running our nodes inside virtualization. (At the time: UML, and we built our own on top of it. Xen wasn&#x27;t nearly ready enough back then.)<p>It&#x27;s fascinating to see that the problems we had to deal with 10 years ago are now becoming an issue again.

The rules are pretty straightforward ( have a firewall, don&#x27;t save CVVs, encrypt credit card #s at rest). You then pay an auditor to audit against PCI DSS.<p>If I were looking for vulnerabilities I&#x27;d probably start with any XSS. Chances are the credit card data is locked down tight and encrypted. But what if I can scoop it up as it gets transformed into a token? Also look at where you store the encryption keys to decrypt the card data. There are hardware devices you can use that are especially hardened.<p>The problem with bitcoin is that it necessitates an even more secure architecture because you don&#x27;t have a 3rd party to run to if things hit the fan. Suppose all your credit #s got stolen in this case. You can run to Visa/Mastercard and they will invalidate the card #s in bulk. Or at least do monitoring on them. What do you do when all your bitcoins are stolen?",1394227690

If every single process that generated a key initialized /dev/urandom once, your desktop system or server is unlikely to flinch, and given that your router is probably only running three such programs (and one of them probably only happens the first time you turn it on), you are unlikely to notice either (especially given that the thing probably takes a while to boot anyway for unrelated reasons).",1394227316

7362804,comment,7362613,7362698,69,0,jedp,,,"Mozilla Identity dev here.  The reason for that was due to a large degree to time and priorities.  We were close to shipping Persona preffed off in Firefox over 18 months ago.  Then FirefoxOS came along and our focus was changed to implementing Persona as the sign-in system on the device (which we did; it&#x27;s natively supported there).  FirefoxOS has been a massive effort on behalf of the whole company, and it has diverted crucial resources from the Persona effort on desktop.  Then we shifted our focus again to Firefox Accounts and revising Sync.  A native implementation of Firefox Accounts should be landing in FirefoxOS 1.4.  As a result, we have native BrowserID support (both Persona and Firefox Accounts use this protocol) in FirefoxOS and as a backbone in desktop Firefox.  There is a lot of persona in Firefox right now, but sadly you can&#x27;t see it.  Despite these massive efforts, we <i>still</i> have not been able to land the last patches to surface this in the UI on desktop.<p>And you&#x27;re right, it appears to send the message that Mozilla did not see enough importance in federated, user-controlled identity on the web to make sure it landed in the desktop browser.  But Mozilla, like all organizations, has to balance its priorities.  There&#x27;s a lot going on, and the decision was made that other projects would take priority.  I hope the decision is revised in the future.<p>If it looked half-hearted, I can assure you it was not from lack of effort or dedication from the team.

Do you claim that all these invocations should actively wait on /dev/random? Even if OpenSSL manages to keep the global state, doing this only once after the boot (how can it know that?), then every other library would need its own global state and its own new /dev/random call for not knowing that other libraries already did this. See how it becomes always less reasonable?<p>Once again, kernel can&#x27;t manage to do it only once after the boot, in general.

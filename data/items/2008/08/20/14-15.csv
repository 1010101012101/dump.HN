281507,comment,281310,281467,0,0,Tichy,,,"The most interesting aspect of Game Theory I have encountered are the ""Evolutionary Stable Strategies"". Not sure if they are even officially considered Game Theory, as I read about them in a Dawkins book.<p>But I think the concept is extremely important when trying to understand the world around us. It makes the ""people are just not rational"" aspect irrelevant - evolution in the long run is rational, or rather mindlessly testing all the relevant strategies, so we still need Game Theory to figure out which strategies will be the most likely to prevail.",1219244234

281505,comment,281221,281221,0,0,wwalker3,,,"Interesting essay, but it sounds like to the author, programming is merely glueing together things that someone else has written, or writing a few pages of code to translate some text from one format to another.<p>For small-scale projects like that, scripting languages are great. But on larger projects, the advantages of scripting languages turn into disadvantages.<p>For example, say you're writing a short program in Perl that just has to work right now. If you discover that in some corner case, you need to shove another data member into one of your objects, you don't have to go back and fix your object definition -- you can just cram it into an instance and have done with it.<p>But large programs are very hard to understand if objects don't have a coherent identity over time. Scripting languages give you the freedom to ""just make it work now"", but they don't give you the ability to make decisions about your program's inner structure and enforce them. This inner structure is what makes a large program understandable and maintainable.",1219244049

And if you're friends aren't hip enough to have an SMS plan, what are the odds they are all going to have smartphones and this little app running? Approaching nil.)<p>I do take issue with the slow and inconvenient part. It's real time and much less distracting than a phone call. If you stick with it for a few days you can type messages at a surprising rate and it really is faster than a phone call. You don't stop what someone's doing and take over when you send someone a text message. SMS has the convenience of email and the immediacy of a phone call.",1219244043
281503,comment,281310,281461,0,0,Tichy,,,"Usually when I try to read a philosophical text, I find it very unsatisfying. The philosophers are just not rigorous, effectively invalidating all their own thoughts.<p>Take chapter 23 from the lecture. It is about ""how to live life in the face of death"" and possible ways to maximize ""value"". But it seems to dodge the question what is value in the face of death, which would be the only worthwhile question. Instead it dwells on ways to optimize value, which could be better done with solid economic theory (it is ""how to invest actions and time to maximize results"").<p>Why does it matter what value one's life has? The lecture doesn't seem to give an answer. Will there be a judgment in afterlife, depending on our lives value? I don't think so. I think the ""value"" is strictly a subjective, individual thing, and therefore Philosophy can't help much with it. Perhaps what is useful is to get a better idea of the effects of our decisions (will people be harmed by my life style, that kind of stuff). But then again it seems ""hard sciences"" would be much better suited to answering that question than ancient poems and philosophy.<p>Even if you believe in a judgment after life, I guess then you should assign a probability to the kind of god you will encounter and align your actions accordingly. I just don't see how philosophy could help.<p>Except if you say mathematics is a special kind of philosophy - I could accept that. So in theory there could be useful philosophy, but I have never seen it (except for maths).<p>Take that lecture: I actually new I could safely skip most of the chapters because they are obviously irrelevant (like the one's about ""is there a soul or not""). They are just WAY too shortsighted. I bet they don't have a proper definition of what a soul would be, to begin with.",1219243996

281501,comment,281310,281461,0,0,Retric,,,"Most philosophy questions are a result of language not abstract ideas.  When someone says something 'blue boy dry kite'  you try and extract meaning so when encountering an idea that lacks meaning you still try and parse it.  Some words even imply a world view that could be wrong.  So: Q: What is ethics in a random universe? A: They are not compatible concepts. (In other words the question is wrong.)<p>PS: As to the few big questions like life after death there is nothing in philosophy that let's you tackle such questions.",1219243856
281500,comment,281431,281445,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I'm generally inclined to agree with you. That's why I was never really in favor of any downvoting schemes. But what I'm trying to suggest is not downvoting; it's only slightly more than a <i>placebo</i> for downvoting.<p>(An ""irrelevant"" flag that didn't even display a vote total would be <i>purely</i> a placebo. If it weren't for the fact that the users here would immediately figure out the trick, I'd semi-seriously propose the placebo idea. Restraint is easy to preach, but sometimes difficult to practice, and one way to make it easier is to offer a displacement behavior. Instead of getting angry, you can forcefully click a button and depart. ;)<p>And I wouldn't have even brought up the idea of a formal Cold Shoulder system if I hadn't seen so many users -- including myself -- doing it anyway, using comments. Perhaps this <i>ad hoc</i> comment method that we currently use is actually better than a formal system for feedback. I'm not sure. But I figured I'd at least discuss the idea for a minute.<p>Why don't people show more restraint and just have faith in the force of gravity? I just discussed the irrational reason: they could use a better displacement behavior. The rational reason is that, as the number of off-topic submissions becomes a greater and greater percentage of the submitted stories, one fears that new submitters are increasingly unable to tell the difference between a story that dies because it is offtopic and a story that dies because it's lost in a sea of other submissions. So, they keep trying. I'm not sure I blame them. Why shouldn't users submit the kind of highly-crafted linkbait that works so well on sites like Reddit and Digg? The answer is that many such links don't work well with the culture we're trying to foster on HN, but users aren't born knowing how HN culture works. Experienced folks have to teach them. And one good way to teach people is to have a means of providing subtle corrections: One that's more gentle than a stiff-arm to the face, more polite than a cutting insult, and less work to create than a well-crafted post.<p>Anyway, perhaps you are right and I just needed further encouragement. I will return to the ""restraint"" tactic, and we'll give the whole thing another three months and see what transpires.",1219243702

281469,comment,280841,280841,0,0,ca,,,"I think that for some user types and in some applications sacrificing capability for simplicity can actually be a good idea in product design. It seems that most humans experience ""decision fatigue"" when dealing with extremely feature-filled products and find their productivity decreases when using it.<p>By decision fatigue I mean that it seems that on average, people make worse decisions if they've had to make a lot of other decisions recently. Furthermore, it seems that accepting that a certain option will not be chosen also contributes to this. [1]<p>Relating this to product design, each new feature represents an additional decision that must be made when a user attempts to accomplish a task where the feature is presented as relevant -- ""should I use this feature, or shouldn't I?"" Even if the feature is not used, it's presence as an option contributes to decision fatigue.<p>I agree with Prof. Norman's point that good design helps alleviate these issues by giving us the mental models to avoid considering irrelevant features during interaction. The problem is that both the users of these designs and the designs themselves are imperfect, leading back to the fatigue caused by consideration and decision making about irrelevant details and options.<p>Maximizing capability is as incorrect as maximizing simplicity. I believe that the ultimate goal should be one that balances simplicity with capability in a way that takes the user's humanity into account such that <i>productivity</i> (whatever it means for a certain product) is maximized.

Most people just don't seem to be that mathematically inclined and they stop iterating through some decision problem well before where logic should take them. As such, it makes a lot of the points that the field is making m00t, as they try pin the results derived from <i>Homo economicus / logicus</i> onto Homo Sapiens.<p>see <a href=""http://slashdot.org/pollBooth.pl?qid=1518&aid=-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slashdot.org/pollBooth.pl?qid=1518&aid=-1</a> for an example of this.

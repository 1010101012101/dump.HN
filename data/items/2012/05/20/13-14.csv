Mexico faces the same supply chain problem as building in America, so it wouldn't really get anywhere.<p>You should also note that with NAFTA in place, there has been significant shifts of manufacturing to Mexico. A lot of car factories sprung up in Mexico after NAFTA (both brand new factories, as well as relocated from Canada/US). While the degree of work being done in Mexico is not as large as in China, it is not fair to say that none as happened.

Coding is one activity that requires a tremendous amount of focus and concentration, you shouldn't even think about this for programmers. And I, for one, find headphones to be irritating and distracting, so that doesn't work out very well either.<p>For programming there are times where collaboration and group innovation is great--it's before you start coding. Yes, by all means hang out in bullpens and shoot darts at each other, cool. But once you start building, you take your piece of the structure and go build it in solitude. If you need to confer with someone else you figure out how to make it happen, whether it's walking up and interrupting them or even if you have to schedule a meeting.

3998754,comment,3998490,3998490,1,0,NyxWulf,,,"For this type of service spamgourmet is my long time favorite.<p>Create disposable e-mail addresses that forward to your real e-mail address.  You get a name stub and then you can create e-mail addresses on the fly.  For instance you can have something like ""hacker"" as your name stub, and they have 20ish domains to use.  So it works like this, say you are signing up for a subscription with inc you can then use inc.hacker@recursor.net or inc.hacker@neverbox.com or inc.hacker@spamgourmet.com.  Whichever you prefer as the domain.  In this case it would use my default burnout rate which is set at 3 when you signup.  I bumped mine up some, but you can also specify it.  So if you wanted say 10 e-mails before it burned out you could use inc.10.hacker@recursor.net.  If you don't do anything else, once you receive 10 e-mails at that mailbox it will burnout and start eating them.  You can also go whitelist the domain so if you get an e-mail from inc.com it will come through, but it will use the normal burnout settings for e-mail from anyone else.  There are also much more advanced features for when/if someone figures out how this works and tries to spam you like setting watchwords.  So if an e-mail doesn't contain the current watchword it will not allow the creation of a new e-mail address, but old ones continue to work.<p>One thing that is nice is the interface shows you how many e-mails have been received on a given address versus how many have been eaten.  For instance when I signed up with inc, they apparently gave my e-mail away and I started getting e-mail on that inbox, so I let it burn out.  Now they can no longer reach me.  Market Samurai has been incredibly bad, they've had my e-mail address for almost 2 years and I have already received 2500 spam messages on that inbox.<p>The great thing is this is all free and open source.  You can  donate, and if you use the service a lot, you probably should.  You can also download all the source and set one up yourself.  Overall the current setup is not user friendly by design.  In the FAQ it specifically discusses they don't want to support end users who can't take the time to read the FAQ.  Overall I cannot overstate how great this has been.  It solves such a major source of pain and does it in such an elegant way.  If you haven't found a service you are happy with, give spamgourmet a try.",1337521897

Back in 1985 I ran out of money half-way through college and enlisted in the US Army for the college fund (plus they repaid my existing student loans, which was a nice deal). I got stationed in S. Korea and became friends with a number of KATUSA soldiers. KATUSA stood for Korean Augmentation to the US Army, and was mostly college students fulfilling their service requirement.<p>Quite a few of my KATUSA friends were engineering students like myself. They told me that the average starting salary for an engineer was $400 / month. So when I see that 25 years later, the average factory worker is making 5 times that amount, it's truly stunning.<p>As a side note, when I was there, most of the cars on the road were new. It wasn't because everyone could afford to ditch their old cars and buy new ones. It was because prior to that period, not many people could to afford to buy any car, so there simply weren't many old ones.<p>And their products were crap. Buy a TV, VCR, or other electronic device, and they often failed out of the box. Pop open the hood of a Korean car and you half expected to see a squirrel on a tread mill. But they keep plugging away, improving quality, and growing their markets. Today, I buy Korean products with confidence.<p>People talks about the rise of China, but to me, with factory salaries at $2000/month, South Korea is the more impressive success story in the developing world.",1337521583

3998729,comment,3996557,3997207,3,0,bryanlarsen,,,"As somebody who sometimes cycles on the road even though there is a bicycle path and gets honked at by assholes like you, there are usually many different reasons why a bicycle isn't using the bicycle path.<p>Here are some of them:<p>- it's actually not a bike path.   It looks like a bike path, but if it doesn't have a yellow stripe down the middle and isn't signed, it's a sidewalk, and it's illegal and probably dangerous to cycle on it.<p>- the speed limit on the path is 20 km/h, and I'm going 30.<p>- it's a mixed use path, frequented by toddlers who are very unpredictable and sometimes hard to avoid when going at high speed.   I'd rather deal with assholes on the road than endanger toddlers.<p>- it's a mixed use path, frequented by people walking dogs.   They're dangerous because dogs can veer suddenly, and that leash can snare a bicycle very easily<p>- it has poor road crossings.   Most ""recreational"" bicycle paths in North American cities are much more dangerous for cyclists than riding on the road is, even though they seem safer.   Why?  90-95% of all bicycle fatalities happen at intersections.  The bicycle path still has to cross roads, and they generally do so either by merging with the sidewalk or by setting up a crossing a few yards away from the intersection.   Some drivers do not slow down or look until they reach the intersection proper.  To cross safely you have to slow down to walking pace and be hyper-vigilant like a jaywalker.   The safest place in an intersection is as close to the centre as you can get, where you are visible to everybody.<p>- it has lots of curves and lots of close trees.   Which means that visibility around curves is very poor, so it's not safe.   It was designed for pedestrians, not cyclists.<p>- it doesn't actually go where I want to go.   This is more common than you think:  just because it parallels your road now, doesn't mean it will later<p>- I don't know where I'm going.   Bike paths are very random, and often aren't marked on maps.   If I'm following a map designed for cars, I have no choice but to use your road.<p>In summary, most so-called ""bike paths"" in North America are really just repurposed walking paths, and are unsafe and slow.   Cyclists should be on the road.",1337521485

A cropping plate is a sheet of steel with holes drilled for all through-hole component leads.  You place a few PCBs on it, then stuff all components.  You then place the plate on the cropping machine, which has ""drop down pins"" to hold the components in place and sliding blades under the plate which scrape / cut the leads off.  You then take the PCBs off the plate and put them through a wave solder machine.<p>One potential problem with tacking topside (and this is more theoretical than real) - sometimes the through hole plating is cracked.  On a multilayer PCB this may mean that you don't have proper connection between all layers.  If you only solder from the bottom of the board you can see if the solder has correctly flowed.  Some high-spec jobs will forbid soldering on the topside.  (Aerospace, etc.)",1337519359

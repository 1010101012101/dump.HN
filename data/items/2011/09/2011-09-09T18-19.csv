Haven't you noticed that Americans are obese drug addicts with little knowledge of world culture, don't speak any other languages at all, and love to declare war or otherwise bully anyone they can while shouting rah rah patriot freedom? That is part of what happens from never being able to take a month of vacation, which means no long trips to europe or south america or africa or anywhere really other than across the state line to the indian casino for a few days of gambling and buffet eats.<p>All right, perhaps not every one would go mad. There's quite a few jobs especially in bureaucracies like government and banks where work is a social club where they chat and drink coffee all day. These people probably don't need a vacation, but they are the ones where there is no problem for them to take it since they weren't contributing much in the first place.<p>It's the productive people that get backtalk from managements about vacation: ""You can't go, we are in a crunch.""; ""This is a crisis, where is the team spirit.""; ""I can't believe you are considering taking 5 days off this year when things are the way they have been lately.""",1315594794

2979360,comment,2979271,2979271,2,0,dreamdu5t,,,"OP's post misses the root of the problem: Increasing technological productivity slowly eliminating the market for manual labor and low-skill jobs. The only jobs left for these people is service jobs which don't pay enough. These people aren't going to go away.<p>Not every human being is a well-adjusted intelligent computer programmer. Some just want to be told what to do, and get paid for it. These jobs are slowly being replaced by machines and they will never come back. McDonalds will eventually replace order-takers with machines, but they will still need customers. What will this segment of society do?<p>That seems to only leaves three options to solve the lack of jobs: 
1) Create busywork jobs for them 
2) Provide welfare for them 
3) Oust them from society<p>First and third options tend to be impractical, and the second and third options are objected to by the populace on moral grounds. Leadership chooses the status quo and the problem just gets worse as the economy becomes increasingly knowledge-based.<p>You might think that another option is to give businesses money, but that doesn't work in the long-run because business' opportunity for investment is increasingly in ventures where menial labor/low skill jobs are either done overseas or by machines. Especially in America where you can often get that labor elsewhere for much cheaper.",1315594417

2979349,comment,2978933,2978933,6,0,krschultz,,,"The author has the concept of a patent troll entirely backwards. The author is arguing that the trolls are people who have prior art to a patent and then come along and submarine legit patents after they have been issued. In the author's world, the victim is the patent holder who paid the money to get a patent.<p>In the real world, the patent trolls are the patent holders that don't actually use their patents, not the ones invalidating patents with prior art. This law only makes it worse, now the patent trolls don't even need to buy patents from legit inventors, they simply have to patent inventions before the inventors get around to it.<p>Before this you could keep good records of your work and be safe in the knowledge that if anyone patented your idea after you created it, you would at least have the prior art to prove you came up with it first. Now you <i>must</i> patent it in order to be safe. A troll can come along at any time and patent your idea and screw you out of your hardwork.<p>If I'm an un-employed patent lawyer, why don't I just sit around reading tech news all day and patent every un-patented startup idea that comes up and sue the companies for their VC money?",1315594209

2979323,comment,2978082,2978436,5,0,bugsy,,,"I am a designer, engineer and entrepreneur, but I have also taught high school in the past.<p>As an engineer, I would not consider working for a place that had a problem with less than 4 weeks vacation. It is absolutely necessary to have that as a minimum to recharge and do a great job. If I'm not allowed to do what I need to to do a great job, I don't want the job, I tell people to give it to some lackey instead and just be comfortable with their full on corporate BS environment.<p>I think that the extremely lengthy vacations should be taken into consideration when discussing teacher pay issues. It's relevant since a lot of teachers take part time jobs in the summer, something 12 and 11 month workers can't do. Some even write books and generate additional income that way, and recognized copyright case law in the US has the cool exception that books written by full time academics are not work for hire by their bosses. That's not the case for those of us in engineering where companies try to grab all they can.<p>Teaching high school in the US is extremely emotionally exhausting. You're expected to be a social worker and you deal with people with problems, yet you have little training and no support or back up or authority for dealing with this. When I was a teacher, if I did not have the entire summer off, I would have gotten a gun and come in and shot the entire administration. Not because I am crazy, I've had a psych eval for security clearance and am completely stable. It's just how close to breaking being a teacher in the US will drive you. The system is incredibly dysfunctional. Work stress is comparable to being a soldier on the front line. Most teachers are suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. I am not surprised when I hear of so many female teachers having sex with their students - that is not because they are pedos, it is a stress response from having a total emotional breakdown from working in a horrific system.<p>If the 3 months of vacation time was removed from US schools, we would see a wave of teacher led psychotic breakdowns, suicides and massacres that would be so legendary they would be spoken of 1000 years from now.",1315593771

The same is true of hoarding much needed commodities, just to raise their price. I'm not even a big fan of speculatively buying up domain names.<p>However, stocks can not be consumed. For most people, there is no reason to transact in the financial market other than financial gain.<p>I don't see how this type of trading automated trading harms retirement investments. High frequency exists because exchanges now allow electronic transactions and automated matching. Algorithmic trading (which generally means automating the execution of large number of shares, such as institutional (retirement funds) orders) have also greatly benefited from same opportunities.<p>If the complaint is that when retirement funds buy or sell large number of shares, HF guys come in and pick them off -- this is no different from regular day traders (or even professional traders). In fact, large trades have no ""right of way"" in the stock market. If you are buying a million shares of some stock, other traders will react and raise the bid. This is not a subversion of how the market works, this is the essence of price discovery and how the market is supposed to work.<p>>I see the market as connecting investors with investments. Spending heavily to leverage momentary arbitrage does not, in my perspective, add significantly to the base function of the market.<p>But does it take away from the base function? Just because some rich guy is spending money on computers, routers, programmers and mathematicians does not mean the market is negatively effected.

Yes, they're possible, and a few sites and designers even manage to do them well without spending wads of money. But, for everyone else, it just represents an additional layer of effort without any direct benefit to themselves.<p>There's a point at which we should accept that our pontifications about the ""ideal"" design, engineered for every conceivable device and screen resolution and software platform, is just completely impractical for the majority of designers and developers.<p>Developers already are expected to make sites work:<p>- with and without Javascript;<p>- with IE 6 - 8, Firefox 2 - 7, Safari, Opera, Chrome, and every other two-bit browser out there;<p>- with readable text and fonts on systems that may or may not have particular or even common fonts installed, including Linux which can render even decent fonts nearly illegible and including the font-weight differences between MacOS and Windows;<p>- on screen resolutions varying from 800 x 600 to OMG x AreYouKiddingMe, without horizontal scrolling or wasting lots of screen real estate;<p>- without compromising people with disabilities or screen readers.<p>Did I miss anything?<p>I think these are unrealistic expectations, and I submit as evidence the great majority of websites online -- including the professionally-designed ones -- which fail catastrophically on at least one of those points.<p>Now, we're to be expected to make these same sites, using the same general design, work on devices with ittybitty screens and radically different physical interfaces?<p>No.<p>Here's what I hope happens instead: I hope that the concept of the CMS gets extended a little bit and begins to do a better job of abstracting the content from the design, so that sites can easily manage two or more completely different presentations designed for specific devices. (I understand Wordpress already does something like this?)<p>You'll have your blog or what-have-you, and your blog will have a mobile version, and a desktop version, and they will be completely and totally 100% separated from and independent of each-other.<p>Because any attempts to make a desktop design work at all on mobile devices without compromising the advantages of the desktop is going to result in much gnashing of teeth.<p>edit: I meant to add that I think the ""right"" way to do this is to continue to make the desktop version of a site the default, at least for now, and then check the user-agent of the request <i>on the server</i>. Let the server handle which layout to serve up, not Javascript, and if a mobile user changes the user-agent on their mobile browser to something which will break sites, then they should expect to get broken sites.",1315592547

Java programmers should not program in Java.<p>I'm not sure that any of these things follow, or if they do, that they have anything to do with Java specifically.<p>At this stage, Java has existed for 15 years.  Once a language has seen serious adoption by regular programmers for a decade, it obviously becomes very difficult to change (for training, IDE, etc. reasons).  It's also unclear if programmers of the language necessarily want it to change.<p>Now, let's be clear.  I absolutely despise Java for a variety of aesthetic reasons.  I'm as happy as anyone else to have a chance to make fun of it.<p>However, if we look at C standards, there's C89, C99, C1X.  C++ standards, there's C++98, C++03, C++11.  These languages, used by millions of programmers (and with very similar syntax, feature set) change every 5--10 years.  What exactly is special about Java?

There is a Ministry dedicated to keeping the French language ""pure"". There is plenty of lip service paid to the preservation of French culture. Basically France is acting like its language and culture is under siege... because it is. There are many examples like this.<p>English as a language seems to have no issue with absorbing the concepts and words of other languages. Once that have been here for centuries have long since been anglicized but more recent adoptees often preserve the original pronunciation.<p>So what you see as Japanification I see as English-speaking culturue and language simply absorbing another language and culture. This changes the language and culture but both remain firmly ""English"".<p>One could even characterize this as ""cultural hegemony"". It's not really any different to Romanization that took place 1500-2500 years ago.<p>I would even argue that as much as you might think of this as Japanification that Japan is probably becoming more American/English than we have become Japanese. Japan is still obviously a very different place to the US but many things have changed.

2979176,story,,,1,1,kaput,"Ask HN: Advice for a one-man services startup?",,"(Apologies for the amount of text; questions are at the end.)<p>I'm a fairly ""high-end"" Linux/network admin with a very broad range of experience. I've no formal training, but in less than 10 years, I am now responsible for 1000+ high-security servers.<p>That said, I'm getting pretty tired of having my fate and job satisfaction rest in someone else's hands. I make good money, but I'm willing to walk away from some of it (especially temporarily) for higher job satisfaction.<p>So, I've decided to start my own IT services company. My last job was as the lead engineer for just such a company which focused mostly on small-to-mid sized businesses. I think I'm going to emulate their model as it was wildly successful and there's a <i>lot</i> of companies out there that don't need a full-time IT person and/or full-time a specialist, but need someone to do the work. That's where I come in.<p>Here's a summary:<p>1) Pre-paid, hourly contracts
All work and time spent is documented and then signed off by the client on completion. I keep an inventory of hours and initiate re-upping of contracts when the client's hours ""inventory"" become low.<p>2) Rates
My last employer offered ""tiered"" hourly rates ($125-$200). I'm thinking of a flat $150 per hour for most clients. Scheduled after-hours work is x1.5 and unscheduled emergencies are x2 (most clients realize it's not really an emergency and will schedule when reminded of the ""unscheduled emergencies"" clause.)<p>3) Regularly scheduled appointments
Two-thirds of my last employers business was from regularly scheduled appointments. I'm planning on focusing on the same type of arrangements (with one/two appointments scheduled per week). I may set up ticketing systems for customers to submit tickets for non-emergencies for me to prep for and tackle when I get on-site (or remotely).<p>4) Not a re-seller
I don't want to be a re-seller. I've found that clients (rightfully) don't trust most VARs because they profit from the sales. Instead I'll make recommendations and the customer buys the hardware. They just pay me for what their IT guy would do. If they prefer, they can pre-pay me cost of hardware and I'll facilitate the purchase, but for a 10% fee (full transparency).<p>I've already got some interested clients and my minimum know-I-can-make-this-work threshold is 10-15 billed hours per week. Once I get to 25+ hours, I may consider bringing on an employee.<p>The great thing is that I need almost nothing to start. I've got a name, the domain, and a laptop. The only thing is I need to save up a bit more seed money and/or pre-secure a few clients.<p>That said, I've got <i>lots</i> of questions about how to form the company (LLC?), business insurance, accounting practices, and many of the other business issues.<p>I'm very good at this and I had previous clients beg me to start my own company so they could work with me exclusively. I'm confident I can do this. I just need to get the details and timing figured out.",1315591804

In protestantism, spiritual development comes from contemplative experiences (e.g. thoreau) that are set apart from everyday life, that hopefully allow you to connect more fully with both the secular world and your religious values once you get back to mainstream society. And in fundamentalist christianity, spiritual development comes from the active and purposeful rejection of secular society.<p>I think the reason we have so many extremists in the GOP right now is as a reaction to the existential arrogance of modern liberalism. E.g. not only do fundamentalists see things like Starbucks and Michael Cera / Seth Rogan movies as endorsing an implicit set of values and model of spiritual development, but they see also them as basically purposely shitting all over their way of life just to rub it in.

I noticed they were showing standard busybox ping output, so I tried out the basics: semicolons, ampersands, etc.  They seemed to be throwing a null in at the first instance of a semicolon or other special characters, cutting off your command and preventing exploitation.

Someone already mentioned Nasuni.<p>TwinStrata might be closer (block oriented I think, iSCSI interface). <a href=""http://www.twinstrata.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twinstrata.com</a><p>I think Gartner refers to these products as ""cloud storage gateways."" Also known as ""hybrid cloud storage."" Google either of those to get a list.<p>Good question about the pain points TuaAmin. Those usually include:
a) never having to run out of storage again
b) never having to deal w/ tape backups again
c) knowing you can recover data to anywhere in the event of a disaster",1315591291

Again he made the same joke about how he doesn't know what Business Development people do.<p>Although I'm originally a programmer; in the past I've also had a title of VP, Business Development. During those years I did everything and anything I could imagine for the company I worked for, from cleaning up the office for important visitors, to writing product specs, whitepapers, web pages, user guides, proposals and new product suggestions and features, to selling to and managing partners, customers, journalists and investors, to speaking in conferences, etc. I.e. I developed the business.<p>Then later when I applied for a job, I was shortlisted but finally turned down because I had had a title of business development and the hiring manager didn't like that (that's directly what he told me).<p>So Steve, what's wrong with business development? Why does it give such bad vibes to people? And is this a universal thing?",1315591287

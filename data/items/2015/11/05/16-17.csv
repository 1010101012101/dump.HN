The first is the danger, especially considering the rate of technical evolution, of your trade being obsoleted before your retirement. A focused development into one field leaves workers unable to pivot in reaction to changing environments.<p>The second, in my opinion, represents a misunderstanding of why the (likely STEM) college degree has become the defacto gate to employment. Academic curricula, by design, focus far less on skills and masteries that are directly marketable and instead focus on building a foundation in a given field from which students can build on later (in either employment or  higher studies and research). In my experience, the first 6 months to two years of many technical jobs is exactly the apprenticeship you&#x27;re alluding to. However, they are being subsidized by the employer, not the taxpayer. Given the investment being made in new hires, the focus on cheap (from the employer&#x27;s perspective) general signals to basic competence (like the ability to complete a degree at a university that already invests heavily in selecting for the best candidates) becomes a logical position to take.<p>I say all of these things, but unfortunately can&#x27;t offer a solution.

There&#x27;s no reference made to any of the potential issues that come up when investigating the historicity of Jesus.<p>Now, to be clear, I believe in a historical Jesus, Savior, Messiah, second person of the Trinity -- I&#x27;m doctrinally quite orthodox.  But I think when you&#x27;re arguing for a historical Jesus, it&#x27;s important to be clear on what the evidence both does and doesn&#x27;t say.  It&#x27;s important to point out that, for example, the large number of manuscripts helps us determine that the story wasn&#x27;t modified over time, but the accuracy of the original stories must be judged using other criteria (including some of the criteria you pointed out.)  It&#x27;s important to note that &quot;unchanged&quot; and &quot;accurate&quot; are independent questions.<p>-----<p>As for the date ranges themselves, one of the most interesting arguments I&#x27;ve heard has to do with the distribution of names in the canonical Gospels.  Modern archaeology has given us a fairly good idea as to the most common Jewish names in the region in that era, as well as in later and earlier eras and in other regions.  And the canonical Gospels show the same pattern as early 1st century Palestine -- there are several characters named Simon, the most common male name in the archaeological record, and the name is treated like a common name that needs to be clarified (so you see things like &quot;Simon Peter&quot;, &quot;Simon the tanner&quot;, etc.)  In short, the people who wrote the Gospels were clearly familiar with Jewish names in first-century Palestine -- people who lived there during the time of Jesus and then scattered before the fall of Jerusalem.  Compare this to the various gnostic gospels, which hardly ever use names outside of Jesus and whoever their purported author was (Thomas, Mary, etc.)  The lack of ordinary details like names and locations in those writings point toward their being mythology.",1446741186

I think there are really two large phenomena that underlie the apparent decline of liberal arts education:<p>1) More and more people are attending 4-year colleges due to inflation in expectation without necessarily any fundamental change in demand for skills which means 4-years colleges are increasingly forced to perform the roles previously filled by vocational schools and community colleges.<p>2) As our understanding of the world increases and our technological capability expands, more and more things are brought under the umbrella of STEM.  A lot of what counts as science (social sciences, for example) for example would have counted as liberal arts going back a few hundred years.  Even much of computer science as we know it today would&#x27;ve fallen somewhere between math and philosophy.  Study of languages at one point was an extremely liberal-artsy pursuit, but Linguistics is a quantitative discipline with strong connections to math and computer science.

Even in countries that are net receivers of existing jobs, those jobs may not be particularly great ones, in that they may harm traditional industries.

If the purchase is less than ~$100 you don&#x27;t need to enter a PIN and don&#x27;t need to sign anything (we outlawed signatures for domestic payments mid last year). It&#x27;s just done. Visa/Mastercard/banks generally cover any fraudulent purchases using the system so you don&#x27;t need to worry too much about fraud.<p>In addition to this, since the US tech companies generally don&#x27;t appear to have cared about the rest of the world until now, our banks have provided us with contactless payment apps for our phones and unlike the numerous standards being developed in the US, the banks&#x27; apps work with the existing payWave/PayPass systems that are already supported.<p>The reason I&#x27;m bringing this up is to show just how behind the US is when it comes to payments. I&#x27;m currently living in the Bay Area and the only places I&#x27;ve been able to successfully complete a purchase using a contactless payment method are Office Depot and Whole Foods.

You want to have that physical product and certain mental pleasures that come with it, she wants to get money for it. So the question is - why should she pay higher % in taxes than you or me on that money she makes?",1446739224

Sort for CTO&#x27;s, VP&#x27;s of Engineering, who are alumni from your school.  Reach out to those people 1:1.  Talk to them live, reach out seeking their advice.  You&#x27;ll be surprised how receptive they will be to your call. And that&#x27;s how you&#x27;ll uncover hidden summer jobs.",1446739221

Persue education to get a high paying day job.\n2. Live below your means, and save and invest the difference. Don&#x27;t buy new cars. Try and fix as many things\nas you can yourself. Cut back on the Starbucks visits. Go to the library. \n3. Stay out of non first mortgage debt.\n4. Turn off as many advertising sources as possible. Get rid of cable TV, seek out free sources of entertainment instead. Get on the do not call list, contact the Direct Marketing Association and tell them not to mail you promotional materials, Tell businesses you patronize not to send you promotional materials. \n5. After you purchase your first home and the first mortgage payments become easy to pay, start looking into investing in rental property.\n6. Build a large F.U. money reserve so that you can tell exploitative employers to &quot;take a hike&quot; if need be. Read up on American employment law. Most of you will be shocked on how biased it is towards employers.\n7. Read up on how to start your own business. Fictitious names, incorporation, small business loans.",1446739210

If you ask at the distilleries, they&#x27;ll tell you it&#x27;s because the bourbon casks are simply cheaper.<p>Scotch generally doesn&#x27;t age in new oak. But <i>all</i> bourbon does, by law. So there&#x27;s a pipeline of used barrels for Scottish distilleries to use.<p>If you get a chance to try to Woodford Reserve new/old wood rye sample, you&#x27;ll see why Scots use our barrels: the first aging in whiskey in a new barrel extracts <i>huge</i> phenolic flavors. Those woody flavors would compete with Scotch, especially since Scotch generally ages much longer than bourbon. Meanwhile, sherry barrels are much more expensive and contribute their own distinctive flavors. So bourbon casks are they way you go when you want a neutral aging environment.<p>I was moved to nerd out about this because you suggested Scotch is aged in ex-bourbon casks because of the sweet notes they impart. I don&#x27;t think this is true. I am a fiend for ex-sherry Scotch, and the sweetness generated by an ex-sherry casks is usually unmistakable, club-you-over-the-head powerful.<p>You&#x27;ll notice that lots of Scotch releases make a big deal out of the wine casks they age in --- what kind of sherry, what age the barrel --- but few ex-bourbon Scotches will say anything but &quot;aged in bourbon casks&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s because bourbon casks are boring. :)",1446739206

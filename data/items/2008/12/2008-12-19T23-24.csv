I'm sure there are many, many fields where Trojan work and a determination not to give up will get you very far if you get a little luck and grab it for all it's worth, but you have to be up to hammering your head at that wall until it breaks, and in some fields the wall ain't breaking (mostly due to licenture issues)<p>A friend took three years to get into video games programming after building a substantial portfolio, getting business experience and doing a Masters that's stupidly competitive to get into, after getting his CS/IT degree.

There is obviously way more variety on the internet than what your friends might have.<p>So, you are correct that there will be counter strategies implemented by the P2P community. This is the way it has always been. ISPs like Comcast started throttling torrents, so torrent clients started encrypting their transfers. Early on, when Napster was sued, new P2P programs emerged that lacked a centralized server, so you could never just shut down the community.<p>I don't know if they will be able to encrypt and mimic http or mail protocols though, the volume and behavior of traffic just wouldn't match up.

403993,comment,403562,403562,0,0,jamiequint,,,"I don't understand why most people here are siding with Twitter. Their TOS clearly say that they don't tolerate impersonation, but running a fan account (or even simply holding a Twitter name and not using it) doesn't amount to impersonation. Why should any company automatically be granted the right to their username on any service? Of course Twitter reserves the right to do whatever is best for their business, but stop glorifying Twitter for doing the right thing, they have just as much of an interest in profit as this guy does.<p>Also, I find it very odd that a community of people who seem to mostly fall on the libertarian/free market side economically have a big problem with domain squatters, or people on Twitter attempting to take advantage of an imperfect market. While I certainly did not like domain squatters when we were searching for company names, I understand why they exist. The market for domain names is not efficient because it values all names at the same price (lsdjhaofiwjleijwa.com costs the same per year to register as google.com) of course this is wrong. Where there is an imperfect market there is usually money to be made, with domains you have domain squatters. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that domains don't tend to lose value so the cost of holding them is very minimal. Its a market, someone is going to make money off of demand. To suppose that domains didn't have monetary value and then they suddenly did when a squatter bought the domain is absurd. They always had value, everyone was just paying below market rate before.<p>Don't like market pricing? Go back in time to Communist Russia.",1229729548

Due to the influx of equal parts quality and junk, a lot of consumers have experienced buyers remorse on the AppStore. Particularly in the first few months... remember the flack the AppStore was receiving for the junk?<p>That said, there's a significant barrier that even a premium 'niche' app must now overcome aside from generating awareness. Couple this with the app likely having very few reviews, not in the Top 50, etc.. then a buyer will become very cautious. (Myself included). In addition, user review system is broken (1-way channel), significantly less than 20% of customers will leave feedback, and upon uninstalling the app rating defaults to 1-star.<p>I've been struggling with trying to figure out how to best overcome this as a marketer.

So, it's not enough for Facebook (or anyone) to make money off of money invested.  It must make more money off that investment than the investment could get at a standard investment rate.  If Facebook is worth $100trillion in 100 years, it doesn't justify a $15B valuation because that $15B would become over $200trillion in average stocks.<p>Specifically, the math is: sigma[1,100,$profit/1.1^k]<p>Sorry for the notation.

I have worked with startups in Silicon Valley since 1984 and remember the ever-increasing dismay throughout the period extending right up to the early-to-mid-90s of the ""UNIX guys"" (that is how I saw them) as they were almost ready to explode watching Microsoft apparently taking over first the consumer desktop and then the enterprise with what they saw as crappy products relative to the far more robust systems they worked with and developed. All they could do was shake their heads in dismay and bemoan the fact that consumers and enterprise customers could be so forced to conform to the lowest common denominator that DOS/Windows and their progeny begat - all the while complaining of Bill Gates's ""evil empire.""<p>I mention this only to emphasize, for those who are younger, how all-pervasive this dispirited mindset was back then. Of course, this all changed with the Internet and the rest is history.<p>I think this piece reflects that mindset perfectly: Microsoft sucks? Of course, it always has!<p>I don't even know that this is fair characterization of what Microsoft did or did not achieve back in the day (I am not a techie guy) but I do know that it was how Microsoft was overwhelmingly <i>perceived</i> by many of the tech-savvy people even as it was crushing all competitors.",1265471441

The money raised was apparently a small angel round, with a somewhat larger follow-on round, one would assume from the same angels. At some point, they determined that there was no good market worth pursuing and shut it down.<p>I don't see anything here to implicate VC funding as the culprit. In saying that, I would add that I love bootstrap companies and believe that, in general, they represent the wave of the future for the startup world. I just don't think anything in this piece supports the idea that VC funding kills companies (VC funding, whatever its shortcomings, is and always will be an integral, and major, part of the startup world and, indeed, of its premier segment).<p>A prime strategy of many of the bootstrap companies I work with is to use bootstrapping, coupled with angel funding, to build valuation while <i>deferring</i> any attempt at VC funding and, then, once initial goals are met, to approach VCs from a position of comparative strength and high valuation so as to get good terms. Others, of course, seek to bootstrap their way toward an acquisition. I would say only a minority plan to build for the long-term in the way the author of this piece discusses (this path can be treacherous in fast-changing tech markets).<p>The post itself is a good one.

Pho is a touch dish to make requiring lots of detail to assemble complex ingredients in the right proportions over many hours. Good places are famous, bad places die.<p>Around where I live the best Pho place is ""Pho 75"". However, eating there is like eating at a cheap cafeteria. There's almost no decoration, everybody eats at long, fold-up tables like you might see at a middle school. They don't really have much of a menu and it's printed as cheaply as possible and then laminated so they don't have to print more. Napkins are the $2/1000 type you get at institutions, the silverware is so cheap it's possibly dangerous, and the chopsticks and soup spoons are made of heavy grade, dishwasher safe plastic. There's almost no service from the staff, they get your order and come back to drop off soup.<p>There are fancier places, with better napkins and silveware, tableclothes and expensive statues of dragons and such in the area. There's a few places that try to make Pho hip and trendy with modern lighting and fancy, custom interior decorator designed decors and fancy napkins.<p>But Pho 75 regularly beats them all. The line at lunch is always out the door (even in frigid weather), usually giving you about 10-15 minutes to actually eat the steaming bowl of soup. Yet from appearances to new people, it's a dive.<p>Anybody who's asked says they go to Pho 75 instead of some other place because of the quality of the soup. Not because of the napkins.",1265470265

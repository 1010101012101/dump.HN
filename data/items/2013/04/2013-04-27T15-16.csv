Even clojure owes part of it's success to the great presentation skills of Rick Hickey and the other early clojure adopters. Languages DO succeed mostly because of marketing, if it was features, then smalltalk would have won, and C++ and Java never would have existed, Lisp would have won and python, ruby and perl would have been forgotten. Even other technologies works that way too, NeXT and the other Unixes would have won, and windows would have never had a chance if what you are saying is true.<p>As for the name, if clojure was named anything that had the word ""lisp"" in it, like ""foo lisp"" or the like, it would have been dead already.

5618091,comment,5617743,5617984,7,0,zzzeek,,,"it's because the stored procedure development model lacks the tools in order to make integrating with an application-level domain model simple.   You end up needing to write not just one persistence layer, that of marshaling your object model to and from SQL statements, but two - all the SQL statements behind your stored procedure layer, and a second to move all the data between the SPs and your object model.  To make matters worse, the stored procedures must be written completely by hand without the benefit of any in-application schemas to help compose statements.<p>One reason for the variety of opinion on this is that different developers make more or less use of domain models in the first place.  Those who are accustomed to writing all SQL completely by hand with no helpers at all, and not working with a domain model tend to view the stored procedure approach as equivalent.   Those who are accustomed to having at least some simple marshaling layers like a construct that generates an INSERT statement given a list of column names see the SP approach as more tedious since simple techniques like that are usually not easily available, at least in more old school SP languages like TRANSACT-SQL and PL/SQL.<p>All of that said, I do think this is a problem that can possibly be solved.   Postgresql allows SPs to be written in many languages, including Python.   I have an ongoing curiousity about the potential to integrate a Python-based object relational system into a stored procedure system.  But it might end up looking like EJBs.",1367077868

Men do have advantages, socially, politically, and economically, that women do not have, and those advantages are far more prevalent in STEM fields than most others.  These programs, directed at young women, act as a counter-balance (though a weak one) to the societal pressures that keep them out of technology in the first place.  When men (of any age) cry foul, well, I just don't have any sympathy. Even with these programs, the scales still weigh heavily in our favor.<p>Up to this point, I've not taken a stance on this particular program, but I will not.  There's plenty of research that suggests that the impact of public ridicule on young women is different than the impact on young men.  While the reasons for this aren't, necessarily, clear, the reaction is different.  Allowing young women to develop their skills in a ""safe"" environment where criticism can be sought from trusted sources prior to making that work public has been shown to be beneficial.  So, in the end, I do support the idea of making it easier for young women to to get private github accounts.  As I also support ""girls only"" clubs that help develop their skills, and counter act the social pressures that push young women away from technology in the first place.  These programs  do exactly as you suggest, they attempt to level the playing field by giving women certain advantages and encouragement to balance the social, political, and economic advantages that men already have.  Until such time as we actually have gender equality, these programs are necessary.",1367076614

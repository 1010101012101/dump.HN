I don't want to have to create or import a project.<p>Whereas, if I'm actually developing something, I'll use IntelliJ because then I need all the additional build tools.<p>I think it's a matter of using the right tool for the right job.

3059591,comment,3059520,3059520,8,0,mdasen,,,"I think part of it is that a lot of IDEs don't ""feel"" good.  For example, Eclipse doesn't feel like a Mac app.  Dragging tabs around works, but is ugly compared to Chrome or similar; the icons used are more utilitarian rather than something someone put thought and care into; often times the advantages it provides for the Java language just aren't as good with scripting languages (less mature support for Python and Ruby, less of a need for an IDE for those languages, and less ability to provide good features since they aren't statically typed).<p>Sometimes you want every feature.  Other times, you want something that might have fewer features, but might feel better.  When the iPhone came out, it didn't have a keyboard, it didn't have 3G, etc.  Yet, it just felt better - the size, the icons, the way you interacted with it.  I think that editors like Sublime Text and TextMate really go for that feel.<p>Users seem to see Sublime Text or TextMate as just missing a feature or two while looking at Eclipse and finding that it has the features, but lacks the basic joy of interaction.  They also feel that it would be easier to extend something like Sublime Text than to fix the feel of Eclipse.  Personally, I'm starting to warm to Eclipse as I use it and I appreciate the features it brings to the table, but I don't ever think I'll see Eclipse as ""feeling good"" in the way that TextMate feels right.",1317455606

With the right level of funding how hard would it be to conduct a heap of controlled landings taking things similar to ISS modules to the moon, and then use similar tech to apollo to ferry astronauts to put together a base.<p>Given the budget is there really any tech that needs to be invented to do something like that? Astronauts could stay no longer than ISS stays so you wouldn't even need to push into new longevity of space travel.<p>Granted the a Mars mission would be a big step up, which makes incremental improvement that seems to work best in tech progression harder. Still I think it's mostly about the budget and the will of people to  want to achieve this stuff.",1317455534

3059588,comment,3059520,3059520,13,0,danieldk,,,"It's a trade-off. An IDE will often provide more and better integration, but is usually focused on a small subset of programming languages and is less flexible.<p>Most editors less integration, but are far more flexible. Take Sublime or Vim, you can customize every bit of the experience with scripts without too much effort.<p>Also, I think some languages tend to need an IDE more than others. E.g. Java's relatively small feature set increases its verbosity. An IDE is almost required to avoid too much typing and memorizing. Haskell, on the other hand, is very expressive, making it less fit for smart autocompletion.",1317455413

Last week I read about scientists who knocked out a rat cerebellum and replaced it with an artificial one - and it worked. A few weeks ago I read about gamers, over the course of a few weeks with FoldIt, discovering how to fold a protein crucial to AIDS research that had eluded scientists for years.<p>Like William Gibson said, he now writes novels about the present because the present has caught up in many ways with science fiction. Not that we have flying cars or heroic robots, not that we have the future they predicted, but every week in the New Scientist you can read about stuff that would have been pure sci fi fifty years ago. We are inundated with magic.<p>I think the space program stood out more because it was channeled through the media that way. Everyone was watching the same thing and the same scientists. Today we have as much science to admire as we have viewing options on the internet.",1317455401

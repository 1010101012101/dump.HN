6490680,comment,6490166,6490166,1,0,mathattack,,,"Very good post.  I think times have changed quite a bit.  Similar to you, coming out of a CS undergrad I only considered huge (20,000+?) firms.  Most of my peers were similar.  1 or 2 went to the 50 person shops, and were considered visionaries.  What&#x27;s changed is people realize that bigger firms don&#x27;t like to change, so you get locked in to old technologies.  They also offer less career alternatives - the top spots are all filled.  So there&#x27;s much less downside to joining a firm that may go out of business.  (Look at Blackberry as the counter-example)<p>There&#x27;s just one thing that you missed - mentorship.  The first job does disproportionately put someone on a career trajectory based on how they learn to operate.  10 years later, your first boss will have a higher impact on your career than your undergrad degree.  This means that it is more important to pick the right first manager at a startup, then getting the firm right.  Finding a boss whom you respect, that will give you time is the most important thing for a new grad.",1380823104

It strongly (and wrongly) assumes that the monthly payments for owning a home are the same as the rent plus whatever you would be putting into savings. There are plenty of homes in other places you can buy for $2000/mo vs spending $2000/mo on rent in SF while saving separately in either case to maintain the liquidity you are talking about.<p>>As I believe I have demonstrated, you have no justification for this statement; none whatsoever.

6490621,comment,6489477,6489477,11,0,tikhonj,,,"I&#x27;ve always liked the Game of Life implemented with stencil convolution[1]. It&#x27;s very declarative.<p>Stencil convolution[2] transforms a matrix (often an image) by taking a small matrix--the stencil--and using it as a set of weights to add all that cell&#x27;s neighbors. Let&#x27;s imagine our stencil is the following matrix:<p><pre><code>    1 2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9
</code></pre>
Then, to process each cell in the big matrix, we start by putting the 5 over that cell. The new value for the cell is going to be 1 times the cell up and to the left plus 2 times the cell directly above plus 3 times the cell up and to the right and so on.<p>If we represent the Game of Life as a matrix--a two dimensional array of Ints--we can use a stencil to easily compute the neighbor count. We would use this matrix:<p><pre><code>    1 1 1
    1 0 1
    1 1 1 
</code></pre>
Applying this stencil gives us a function that goes from the matrix of alive cells to a matrix of neighbor counts. Then, to do a step in the game of life, we just zip the two matrices together with the transition function.<p>The neat bit is that the real code looks pretty close to what I have just said! For example, here is how the stencil looks:<p><pre><code>    neighbors = [stencil2|1 1 1
                          1 0 1
                          1 1 1|]
</code></pre>
We can use basically the same transition function as in the post:<p><pre><code>    transition a 2 = a
    transition _ 3 = 1
    transition _ _ = 0
</code></pre>
And the actual step algorithm:<p><pre><code>    step grid = R.computeUnboxedS . R.zipWith transition grid $ 
                  mapStencil2 (BoundConst 0) neighbors grid
</code></pre>
(BoundConst 0) just tells the stencil to treat every square outside the large input matrix as 0. R.computeUnboxedS just turns the result of zipWith back into an unboxed array.<p>Now, the computeUnboxedS function call is not really intuitive. Unless you knew how the API was supposed to work, you would not think of it. This is where Haskell&#x27;s types come in, acting like active documentation: you can see that you need the computeUnboxedS function because that&#x27;s the only way to get from the type at the result of zipWith to the type you actually want!<p>Anyhow, this is not the best way to implement life, admittedly. The biggest shortcoming is that, since you&#x27;re using an array, the field is always bounded to the same size and you&#x27;re always representing <i>every</i> cell, even ones that won&#x27;t be alive for generations. Mostly, this is just a great example to see how stencil convolution works!<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/kizzx2/repagolpdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/kizzx2/repagolpdf</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/ndp/Stencil.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers...</a>",1380822709

They say to themselves, &quot;well, I studied for four years and got a job, now it&#x27;s finally time to sit back and relax.&quot; So they put in their regular 9-5 and then come home and waste their lives away by watching TV shows and playing video games and going out and getting drunk on weekends. Essentially, they &quot;settle&quot; into a middle-class lifestyle, where they earn enough money to get by and may be save a little too. They may be content, but they are also always stressed about the prospect of losing their jobs, because at their level of skill and ambition, they are almost always employees, rather than employers. Eventually, that&#x27;s exactly what happens as the work they do is automated and they find themselves unemployed with little savings and no other skill that they can contribute to the economy.<p>The second type has a perpetual hunger for knowledge. They see college as the &quot;launch pad&quot; for a lifetime of learning. So they graduate and get jobs, but on the side they continue to read, discuss, listen and apply. They hang out with smart and successful people who also read, discuss, listen and apply. They look for problems and opportunities, and figure out what they need to learn to be able to work on them. These are the Jennifer Dewalt types whose ambition and discipline set them up for a continuously upward trajectory. They are the ones who refuse to settle, and therefore end up as leaders in organizations that innovate and change humanity.<p>It&#x27;s funny because over the years I have developed what I think to be a very reliable method for predicting someone&#x27;s future success.

If you want to have a family later in life, that should <i>not</i> prevent you from living in places you&#x27;d like to experience. You will likely regret being so cautious at the exact time in your life when you had the least reason to be so.<p>> You are building no equity in rent<p>If you are saving a dramatic amount of money per month and putting that money away in savings or another investment vehicle, then I would argue that you very much are. People underestimate how little &quot;equity&quot; they actually build up when they didn&#x27;t happen to buy before or early in a real estate bubble. In reality, the closing costs of acquiring the property, maintenance, insurance, and property taxes, and the (optional but likely) 6% sales commission the realtor takes when you decide to sell all add up and chip away at effective equity. True, equity <i>will</i> eventually outpace these costs, but the time that takes is a function of how well the market is doing and other externalities.<p>There&#x27;s also a cost of liquidity. $10,000 sitting in a bank account at 0.1% is arguably worth more than $10,000 of equity in a house that might take 3 months to sell.<p>All of this means that unless you know you&#x27;re going to buy a place and stay put for a while, you&#x27;d probably be better taking the cost difference and building &quot;liquid equity&quot; that you can use later.<p>> so you will essentially have to leave and start over somewhere else to have kids.<p>True, but that may be a complete non-problem depending on your disposition. Personally, I don&#x27;t get attached to places. They&#x27;re just boxes with soft places to sleep. Relationships make it a home. In my case, in the unlikely event I decided to start a family, I could buy a house relatively close to the apartment I live in now (if I so desired). I wouldn&#x27;t call that starting over. By the way, I&#x27;d be able to buy that house because I was able to save a metric crap-ton of cash while living on next to nothing with cheap rent.<p>> Your story is fine as long as it ends with you being single and alone without any real assets.<p>As I believe I have demonstrated, you have no justification for this statement; none whatsoever. It&#x27;s simply not the case that a person who choses to spend one part of his or her life saving money living with roommates in a fun town will be forever &quot;trapped&quot; by that choice.<p>Also, you might not have intended it this way, but that statement was mean-spirited.",1380821908

I&#x27;ve long felt that thin layers between SQL and applications are superior to ORMs. MyBatis and jOOQ are great examples of this, as is Python&#x27;s basic dbapi (PEP 249). But Uncle Bob hits the most important point here, that the application is not the data. Yes, you need some kind of gateway to put data over there or to fetch data from over there, but that interface should not be what drives your application. If you practice Domain Driven Design (DDD) then your application is composed of objects that represent the real world activities that the application engages in. The data is incidental. I still think it pays off to carefully structure your data in your RDBMS or NoSQL datastore because it is likely to be SHARED with many applications, but that structuring is a separate thing from the applications which use and update the data.",1380821875

Then when cellphones first came out, everyone got lackadaisical about dropped calls. And overnight an entire industry worried about reliability &quot;to five nines&quot; changed, and &quot;whatever, it&#x27;s a new service, you&#x27;ve got to expect some difficulties.&quot;<p>The internet started with relatively low reliability.

6490435,comment,6489135,6489135,16,0,hooande,,,"There are several fundamental problems with prediction markets:<p>1) Every market participant is not a savvy investor. InTrade was notorious for political bias and emotional trading (check out the comment section). The idea is that a true insider will place a large bet that provides valuable information to the market. This is rarely the case. Most of the people bet based on what they want to happen rather than what they know will happen. [1] This problem is compounded by the fact that most of the bets on intrade in particular were rather small, hundreds of dollars. People tend to speak more accurately with their wallets as opposed to their mouths, but only with significant amounts of money on the line.<p>2) The markets themselves are never large enough. The system doesn&#x27;t work unless the people that place big bets are experts or insiders. The majority of people aren&#x27;t familiar with the concept of prediction markets, much less any particular sites. One of the best cases for an information market would be someone who works on a political campaign placing a big bet for or against their candidate based on inside knowledge. But something like this can&#x27;t happen until the average political staffer has heard of a prediction market site, which we are still a long way away from.<p>3) The best way to make money from a market is to out think the other participants. Accurately calculating prices based on the current supply and demand situation works too, but it&#x27;s slower and more difficult. Instead of asking &quot;Who do I think will be elected president?&quot; people might themselves &quot;Who do the other participants think will be elected president?&quot; This leads to a functioning market but it doesn&#x27;t do much for the goal of aggregating knowledge to make accurate predictions.<p>I like the concept of prediction markets because I love the idea of utilizing collective intelligence. But I&#x27;m constantly disappointed by the implementations that I see. It&#x27;s a very tricky thing to do but I think that whoever finally figures it out will have built something valuable for all of us.<p>[1] <a href=""http://go.bloomberg.com/political-capital/2012-06-29/intrade-bettors-lost-on-health-care/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://go.bloomberg.com/political-capital/2012-06-29/intrade...</a>",1380821035

When you have two people, getting through the soul-crushing lows is a little easier because odds are both of you won&#x27;t be miserable at the same time.",1380819860

There are multiple other areas, Web development is currently a good entry point for self tough people, but not the only either. I know a lot of people that start with VBA macros in Excel.<p>Let me put it this way: I learned how to change the brake pads in my car. Then I decided that I was going to change the brake pads in 100 different car brands and models, so I did. Can I call my self a car mechanic? Nope, not even a brake specialist because I am forgetting a lot of other pieces and mechanism. But I can make a career out of it, fast brake maintenance.<p>Now I see someone that has the stamina, the admirable dedication to actually go through it, so I see someone that has the ability to go much further than the average guy. Tease her, give her some pointers and directions, if she likes challenges, challenge her to go more out there.<p>It is easy to sit back and clap at an accomplishment, and is no small accomplishment in this case. But she is thirsty for more, challenge her to more!!!... unless you don&#x27;t know where that more is because the belief that web development is all there is to it<p>Some areas of web design is programming... JavaScript, server side, and a long etc certainly are. HTML is document painting. It is important, it requires some serious skills, skills that for that matter I don&#x27;t have, but HTML is not programming because there are no conditionals, no loops. The basics building blocks in programming are those. If this hurts, I am honestly sorry, but you have 2 options, either react in anger (which is a secondary feeling, and you need to see what feeling is the primary), or research what else is there and maybe you will learn a thing or 2. HTML plus JavaScript it is programming, HTML and some CSS can be stretched to call it programming<p>Elitist? Confusing with &quot;Computer Scientist&quot;? I was just giving some pointers into other areas of software development. I did not mention Discrete mathematics, set theory, compiler construction, semantic analysis, etc, etc, etc. Those are areas for a Computer Scientist, and putting her against that can become discouraging instead of challenging, but then again, another computer scientist would have known that, wouldn&#x27;t he?<p>If all that you see about Rich is Datatomic and Clojure, then you are missing a lot. Simple vs. Easy is more what I am talking about, or functions as the thing that make data time travel, aha! that can change the way you think about software development. That is programming BBQ, not HTML salad.<p>If you don&#x27;t know what I am talking about... Google meet my friend here, friend meet Google. If there is something where she is above is that she took a challenge and meet it<p>What the original article did is nothing short of amazing... so much accomplished, so much stamina, so much potential. She claim that she wants to jump off... well, I mention a few pools where she can dive in<p>And finally... what is the difference between a jerk and tough love? can you recognize when you see it?

Similar to radiation, worst?<p>Neutrons are interesting in that they dump all their energy into a very small region. Instead of losing energy continually and gradually, they travel a ways and then dump all their energy into one spot. This makes them potentially very useful for things like cancer treatment (you can select neutrons to ensure they deliver most of their energy into the cancer, rather than evenly along their travel path). I suspect this effect means that, for reactors, the wear and tear is more localized, but of a larger amplitude.",1413395979

8460399,comment,8455966,8456791,0,0,adamtj,,,"Yes, credit card numbers are used as passwords and need to be secret, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that they are also used as names and need to be public.<p>This is the fundamental problem.  We&#x27;re using a single thing both as a secret and as non-secret public information.  This confusion of purposes is what results in the massive data breaches we constantly hear about on the news.<p>When you buy something at a physical store like Target, their computers will store your credit card number.  Why?  They aren&#x27;t Amazon.  It won&#x27;t ease your next purchase as you&#x27;ll still have to present your card.  Isn&#x27;t it dangerous?<p>Yes, but consider what happens when you return something.  They can&#x27;t just give you cash.  That would open the door to money laundering and plain old theft.  They have to put the money back on in your card account.  But which account?  They need to name the account when informing the credit card company of the refund, which means they need to store the name.  That name is the credit card number.  I suppose they could store a hash of your account number and require you to swipe your card when returning items, but that&#x27;s inconvenient.  You might not have the correct card with you.  You may have cut it up.  You may be returning an item for somebody else.<p>A credit card number is the name of the account.  As such, it must be public and cannot be secret.  If instead it is to be the password, then the account really ought to have a different public name.  After all, we need the ability to talk _about_ an account without the mere conversation granting all parties permission to _charge_ the account.<p>Here&#x27;s another way to look at it: My bank will let most anybody take money out of my checking account -- provided they present the bank with two things:  They need to tell my bank which account to take money out of, and they need to present an authorization token granting them permission to do so.  One type of authorization token is called a &quot;check&quot; (though there are others).  An &quot;account number&quot; is how a person specifies which account -- it is nothing more than the name of the account.  Simply presenting the account number is not normally enough to grant access to withdraw from the account.<p>Everybody to whom I write a check will know my account number.  It&#x27;s not a secret.  For convenience, it&#x27;s even written on the check.  What protects my account is that my bank is only allowed to withdraw money when presented with an appropriate authorization token.  They aren&#x27;t even a secret tokens:  they are single-use, tied to a specific person and a single amount, and they can only be activated by me.  Stealing my checkbook won&#x27;t help you.  Stealing a check I wrote to somebody else won&#x27;t help you.  You can&#x27;t cash a check multiple times.  You can&#x27;t withdraw any more or less money than I authorized.<p>The problem with credit cards is that the account name is also the authorization token.  Moreover, it&#x27;s a multi-use, unrestricted token.  It&#x27;s a name that many people need to know and store long-term, but anybody can use it, multiple times, to withdraw any amount of money they choose.  The credit card industry doesn&#x27;t yet have anything that works like checks, which is why they work so hard at fraud detection.<p>The future is probably limited-use auth tokens for websites and chipped cards for physical stores.<p>For websites, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be the same process as signing in to a random website with your facebook account.  Imagine buying something on a website, but instead of entering your credit card number, you are redirected to your credit card company&#x27;s website.  You &quot;sign-in-with Visa&quot; by entering your account password.  You are then redirected back to the website you came from, this time with an authorization token.  That token will only be usable by the website you authorized.  It would be useless to anybody who stole it.  You may even be able to add restrictions.  You could make a token that can only be used once.  Or once a month for up to a year, and no more than $10 each time.  The token will contain your unencrypted account number, so you won&#x27;t need to enter that, but it also won&#x27;t be secret.  Only the token as a whole can authorize a charge, not the mere account number.  The secret is your account password that only you know.<p>For physical stores, chipped cards will likely contain the secret.  Or maybe cellphone hardware or apps.  They can be used to create a valid auth token for a without ever having to surrender the secret to the computer that&#x27;s processing the purchase.<p>Passwords are authorization tokens, but not all tokens work like passwords.  Passwords are an inappropriate kind of authorization token to use for purchases.  Confusing an account name with such a token is even worse.",1413395912

Maybe even eliminate, or at least reduce commercials.<p>And it&#x27;s not exactly a-la-carte, because most channels aren&#x27;t individual networks. And most shows are perfectly suited for on-demand viewing. There are very few things I watch that are actually &quot;broadcast&quot; live (news and sports are pretty much it). All I&#x27;m suggesting is that we bypass the cable companies and pay the publishers directly for content. I&#x27;d pay good money to an Internet Service Provider who gives me a fast and stable connection to the publisher&#x27;s servers.<p>The flip side of all this choice is that it&#x27;s no longer dead-simple for consumers. It sure is convenient to simply pay Comcast $100 a month and they take care of getting all of these networks and publishers into my home in one box with one remote control. Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon apps are fairly ubiquitous on pretty much every platform including built right into many TVs. I doubt traditional TV networks want to invest in that technology.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Networks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Networks</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%26E_Networks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%26E_Networks</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal_Cable"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal_Cable</a>",1413395611

As someone who&#x27;s done a reasonable amount of undergraduate-level film and literature analysis, I felt that the video fell quite nicely in line with that style of presentation, and it&#x27;s clear that Ms. Sarkeesian has a strong background in that area.  If this were for an assignment, she would&#x27;ve gotten a perfect score.<p>However, watching the video as a gamer, not as a student, there is one thing about her video which stands out to me as the reason why she inspires rage in a subset of gamers.<p>Ms. Sarkeesian doesn&#x27;t highlight anything positive about gender roles in the games that she critiques.  While she is under no obligation to do so, the indignant gamer might accuse her of cherry-picking her facts, forgetting that her video series is about &quot;Tropes vs Women&quot;, not &quot;when games do justice and injustice to women&quot;.<p>Her series really is like a homework assignment for a college class, where the professor has asked for a list of tropes.  If she&#x27;d included a &quot;full assessment&quot; of each game, her paper would&#x27;ve been ten times as long, and the professor would&#x27;ve given her a lower grade for including a bunch of irrelevant information.<p>In other words, her series is so single-minded in its purpose (to identify tropes) that it bothers gamers who feel that it&#x27;s unfair that she only talks about &quot;Tropes vs Women in Video Games&quot;.  They misinterpret this as a video series on &quot;games that fail women and are therefore terrible&quot;, when she&#x27;s just doing a series on &quot;games that have these tropes.&quot;<p>They&#x27;re enraged not by what she says, but rather by what she omits.<p>And as far as games journalism goes, the fully-fledged &quot;feminist game ratings&quot; YouTube series/website is a void still waiting to be filled.",1413395191

Replacing an out-of-bound token with one stored purely online. Any actor who controls the network (or your computing device) can subvert the login.<p>3. Depends on a pre-existing authentication, which itself uses passwords (or none at all), leaving you at the <i>exact same state of security</i> as you had before. Instead of two passwords that are the same, you have one password (the e-mail password) that is the same, or zero authentication with SMS.<p>4.

Zero security for the tokens (cookies) stored on the user&#x27;s system, so data at rest is at risk, unless your browser encrypts cookies with a master password. Of course this is moot considering the total lack of encryption on the smtp/sms side and the lack of out-of-bounds auth.<p><i>Reasons why password logins are more secure:</i><p>1. Uses secured, encrypted connections to transmit secrets. Prevents man in the middle attacks and interception of logins.<p>2. Provides an out of bounds auth token. The only way to subvert this is to intercept it as it goes into a computing device, meaning either the client or server would have to be compromised at the time of login.<p>3. Data at rest is encrypted and only the user&#x27;s cached token (cookie) can be used to steal a pre-authenticated login.<p>4. Password can be unique to the service, so a compromise of one system does not compromise all.<p>5.

I mean, does anyone actually notice the difference? Because if that difference means I&#x27;m paying $100-200 extra for a better screen, a better graphics chip etc, and it means my battery life is reduced, I really just don&#x27;t get it.<p>There are several reasons:<p>1. Display quality is very important to (high end) phone users. People use these things for a lot of text-heavy, image-heavy and video-heavy stuff. And the higher resolution makes a lot of difference, particularly for text. I&#x27;m not saying resolution and display quality are the same thing, but resolution is definitely a contributing factor.<p>2. Because they can. Display manufacturing price scales with surface area, but much less so with resolution. Although higher res phone screens are more expensive, they are <i>not</i> that much more expensive. You don&#x27;t pay $100-200 extra for a better screen, the manufacturer pays maybe $30-50 more when compared to a 1080p screen.<p>3. Because people can still see the difference. People still claim Apple made the end-all solution when with the retina displays &quot;you couldn&#x27;t see the pixels&quot;. As it turns out, not being able to make out individual pixels does not mean higher PPI stops adding value. Returns are diminishing, sure, but I sure as hell prefer my text rendered on 500ppi devices compared to 300ppi devices.<p>4. There is in fact a resolution arms race going on mobile phones.

8460159,comment,8459075,8459833,0,0,ar7hur,,,"Thanks for these excellent remarks.<p>We differentiate ourselves from the Android Speech API in several ways:<p>1) As a developer, with Google you have no way to customize the speech engine by providing your language model. Wit.ai builds a specific, customized configuration for each app. If your app is specific and you cannot tell Google what kind of thing it should expect, accuracy will be bad especially in noisy environments. Wit.ai builds a specific language model for each app automatically and in real time (each time Wit.ai learns more examples about your app, it&#x27;s updated), and queries several speech engines in parallel. To do that it uses not only your data, but also relevant data from the community. This is the core of our value proposition and not something Google does provide today.<p>2) Google keep their Natural Language Understanding layer (what translates text to structured, actionable data) for themselves. Developers cannot access this. They&#x27;re left with free text, but they often need actionable data.<p>3) Wit.ai is cross-platform. We have SDKs for iOS, Android, Linux, etc. [1] or you can just stream raw audio to our API. Android Speech API is just available on Android (well, you could hack it and use it from elsewhere but you&#x27;re not supposed to, and you can be shut down anytime). More and more wearables and smart devices will run Linux. For instance hundreds of developers use Wit.ai on Raspberry Pi.<p>As for the Apple doc you linked, it&#x27;s Mac only (no iOS) + it just recognizes a few phrases you provide in advance. I think it&#x27;s a very old API that&#x27;s still here :)<p>Regarding listen.ai, yes please we would love to have Google (especially Now) there. We have the Siri founder, the top Cortana guy, the former CEO of Nuance... but nobody from Google yet.<p>[1] <a href=""https://wit.ai/docs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wit.ai/docs</a>",1413394485

It&#x27;s built in to Safari and securely stored, encrypted with your OS/device&#x27;s master password -- which is an improvement on Firefox & Chrome&#x27;s approach, where master passwords are optional.<p>From a usability standpoint that email method is way <i>worse</i>, at a minimum due to the latency issues. Waiting a minute for an email to arrive can feel like an hour when you&#x27;re trying to log in to do something urgent. Password managers work &quot;magically&quot;.<p>For a security standpoint the email method is also worse, because it is only usable with very long-lived sessions -- which is not the best security practice. The article even heavily qualifies this method as not appropriate for sites users &quot;visit frequently&quot;.<p>So by the author&#x27;s own logic, this method is only appropriate for sites that <i>NO</i> users visit frequently. Which is no sites.<p>Finally, the nail in the coffin for the email approach is that it&#x27;s <i>incompatible</i> with the more general password manager solution. So those users who do need to visit a given site frequently can&#x27;t use a password manager (at least without redirecting themselves to an alternative method, which is also poor usability).",1413394469

Sometimes the compiler&#x27;s default idea is less than optimal, so you can tweak it by adding bangs and other strictness annotations to the code. The semantics change slightly because maybe now you evaluate an expression that throws an exception or goes into an endless loop, whereas before it wasn&#x27;t evaluated, but apart from that the changes are guaranteed not to affect the meaning of your code.<p>Sure, garbage collected languages are not suitable for hard real time, but interactive apps and games are soft real time (a 100 ms delay once per hour isn&#x27;t going to break the game).

8460062,comment,8459205,8459873,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"> Resolution does make a difference.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that resolution inherently makes absolutely no difference. Yes, 100 PPI is markedly different from 400 PPI.<p>As for your comment on printers, it&#x27;s apples and oranges. For example, you can print a 150 PPI image at 600 DPI, and each pixel will be 16 dots.<p>Secondly, dots aren&#x27;t a uniform unit, you can have many different type of dots for different printers.<p>Lastly, it really, really depends what you&#x27;re printing. Newspapers go below 90 DPI and billboards even below 45 DPI. In short, any number is extremely dependent on context. Your numbers are kind of meaningless.<p>But as for my actual question, it&#x27;s not whether resolution matters. Of course it does. Battery life matters, too, but having 1 century of battery life on your phone that you replace every few years, or 2 centuries, doesn&#x27;t really matter, you&#x27;ll agree. There&#x27;s diminishing returns. And there&#x27;s a cost factor.<p>So what I&#x27;m wondering: does the difference between 400 to 450 to 500 PPI create such an improvement to viewing experience, that it&#x27;s worth the hit to battery life and the more expensive hardware you inevitably end up with when trying to push almost a million extra pixels. I&#x27;m not so sure, I&#x27;d much rather get a 720p display that&#x27;s cheaper and lasts longer.",1413393896

Assuming the firmware isn&#x27;t crippled, those sticks should be able to run unmodified copies of any modern x86 operating system.

Equating all of these, as the article points out, rarely causes problems in practice, but it is nonetheless a conceptual error.<p>If you&#x27;ll pardon me pulling out my soapbox for a moment, this kind of bug would be less common if the &quot;programmers don&#x27;t need math&quot; attitude was not a successful meme in our culture. The notion of &quot;between zero and one&quot; may seem straghtforward and obvious, but is actually ambiguous. Perhaps, given the number of distinct floating point values that can be represented in the interval (0,1), it would hardly seem to matter what interpretation of &quot;between zero and one&quot; is used. But in mathematics you will never see such terminology used without a qualifying statement that clarifies* the meaning.<p>*E.g. &quot;between 0 and 1, inclusive&quot;, &quot;on the closed interval bounded by 0 and 1&quot;, &quot;[0,1]&quot;, etc.",1413392653

World events, the weather, another restaurant featured in the paper or on TV all can greatly affect your ability to get asses in seats.<p>It's more achievable to maximize revenue through sales than through anticipated table turns.",1226925577

Also, it still seems to be the most productive language, which is odd, given it's crappyness. Try to find a popular blogging system or CMS that is not written in PHP (I know there are some, but somehow the PHP ones always have more traction).",1226923841

I am capable of reading a book on statistics, but it is not the same as getting some practical experience.<p>I guess I could just start with randomly selected data sets, but somehow that doesn't seem to be enough motivation (like stock market data: seems unlikely to discover something new, with all the Quants already working on it). So I guess what I mean is, among other things: how to find worthwhile statistical problems for starting out? I am not into sports, so betting is kind of out. Also missed the elections, since I am not from the US. I look forward to the book by the 53something website guy, though.",1226923744

I'd always had it pegged as smaller than the USA.<p>The shocking thing is that I got a high grade for Geography when I was in school (what are we teaching our kids?!)",1226923725

You probably needed to stick big blinking irony tags around it though - those of us living in the rest of the world have a poor opinion of American geographical knowledge (justified by the incident to which you refer), and sometimes we forget that the US actually has quite a lot of very well educated individuals.",1226923310

That's it--just something that could read CSV files. We figured that <i>had</i> to be available in classic .NET We look around, dug into forums, and finally got in touch with the local .NET user group guru. The ideal solution? Use MS's communication tools to open the CSV file <i>in excel</i> and read it there. Or? Roll your own.<p>We ended up doing the thing in python and imported the csv lib.",1226923227

Design isn't how something looks.<p>It shouldn't be confused with graphic design though, which is really how something looks.  Graphic design is purely in the realm of the aesthetic.",1216666700

The E66 = $500.  Let's see, buy 2-3 iPhones or one Nokia?  The average US mobile consumer is going to look at the fashion factor / price and very little else.<p>2) The N96 is being released without support for NAM-3G (the same thing they did with the N95), so basically the phone is useless in the US from that standpoint.<p>3) Nokia E66 is not a U.S. spec Nokia N96<p>The N96 might drive sales over in Europe/Asia, but in terms of seizing a growing 3G market in the US, they're absolutely screwing themselves by releasing NAM-3G counterparts half a year later.  Nokia needs to get in the game and realize that NAM-3G is finally here (because of the iPhone 3g), and waiting 6 months isn't helping to push new products.  3G is the US cell-phone buzzword for 2008, and Nokia fully blew it on this one.<p>And yes, I'm pissed, because I expected to get rid of my Euro-spec N95-8 and get an N96 that would fully work in the US.",1216666286

It's an inevitability.<p>I'd like to see a single global licensing body with a harmonised and simplified model covering every component; record labels, publishers, performers, writers, download rights, artwork, etc. There could be ways for them to support small broadcasters - by providing access to a large catalogue of digital music, waiving fees in exchange for delivering ads, etc. From this we'd see some really innovative services bubbling up to the top.<p>However, I still stand behind what I said - if you want to turn a service like mixturtle into a viable business then you have to play their game, which is very difficult. I know it makes me unpopular, but it's just a reality we have to live with (for now).<p>I had discussions with PPL and MCPS-PRS here in the UK a long time ago - their model is pretty complex - and if I wanted to have users in other countries then I'd need to get licensed with their representative bodies too. Not to mention the issue of download rights and artwork - all that has to be negotiated directly with the copyright holders. I'd wanted to build an ad-based model, but in the end I couldn't see any alternative to subscriptions, so I gave up - I couldn't afford the Â£10,000 advance fee.",1216666170

Swedes speak English exceptionally well which is the only foreign language most foreigners know (no one comes in knowing Swedish).  The extra layer of language barrier is an issue (for Swedes and immigrants).<p>For a highly trained (grad school+) immigrant, being limited to one small nation was a big limitation (this was before the common EU passport).<p>As far as preparation for world business, I can't see why any Chinese student would want to learn anything but English.<p>No idea how immigration status changes post-graduation.

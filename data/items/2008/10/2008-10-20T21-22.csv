It doesn't matter to most researchers if they are looking at the results from subject #098352 vs. John Smith, either as a single record or in aggregate. Tacking on the other part of the project -- seeing how subjects' benefit/suffer from the release of their personal information -- may be an interesting experiment on its own, but it could have some very negative impacts on participants and skew the data toward people with a different set of values and lifestyles than the population at large.",1224539725

Well, did you know that the Human eye only percepts approx. 2° of it's total vision(110°x170°) clearly? Through multiple jumps per second of the eye(saccades) we combine the sharp spots(highest bitrate/second<i>mm²) in our brain to an overall sharp and steady picture.<p>My question is: Using a given high end 3d-Graphic-Card and an Eye-Tracker, one could concentrate half of the Render Power on this spot, which is usually displayed on a 20 to 40 ° degree screen. So take the worst case: 0.5 </i> 20°/2° * 20°/2° = 50. And there is my factor 50.<p>So why aren't we using this device:
The Eye-Tracker cost about 15000 to 40000 $.
And lots of the Render-Force is used for focus independent Rendering (reflection, etc..).<p>But: The price could be reduced by mass-production within a few years to 100 $, and probably 10 % of the Render-Power would last for the non clear vision degrees, so one could take 40% for independent rendering.<p>I came up with this idea after understanding objects and though about how the brain could save render power by only checking parts of a new object and recognizing it as real, and afterwards simulating it in its own Semantic-3d-Room Matrix-Engine.<p>Post me if you find the idea cool, have questions, or tell me that I am far outdated(never heard or read about such a application)!<p>Regards",1224538104

Thinking back, I have to agree--I used to see 3 real estate or realtor ads on every page in some of the local papers, but not any more.  It makes sense that realtors made a lot of money, and so did newspapers, so a lot of jobs were created for that short period of time (more realtors, and more journalists, who of course reported about the great benefits of owning real estate.)",1224537834

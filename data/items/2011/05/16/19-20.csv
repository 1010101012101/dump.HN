Riverbed is (or was?) generally regarded as the tech leader in the market and its head start is based on a patented compression scheme. There's no question that the patent is a big part of what allowed the company to survive the entrance of 800-lb gorillas into the market and I'm fairly certain that if software patents were abolished today, that algorithm would be in Cisco's WAN solution tomorrow.<p>I still think the software patent system as it stands now needs serious reform but you know, that saying about a broken clock and all.",1305575878

You yourself state that you can't understand this example in Clojure, which as you admit is almost trivially simple.  Again, I'm 99% positive the Clojure as written is exactly equivalent to the full Java versions, so he really couldn't be clearer on this particular example.<p>It is a hard task in the end as an author, to come up with an example that CAN be understood by someone who likely only knows one of the languages talked about, yet still provide some comparison.  I think he deserves some credit in that he does try to make them exactly the same code (probably very similar bytecode even), just expressed in that language.<p>To your contrived point, I would say running through the elements in a list and operating on them is far from contrived, rather it is one of the most common operations we do day to day.  That Java is particularly verbose about that isn't the fault of Clojure.<p>To keep this constructive, what piece of Java code / functionality would you use as an example?",1305575742

The primary goals of these designs were weapon related programs. Even molten salt reactor (supposedly coming in the happy future as Gen IV) was successfully prototyped in Oak Ridge 40+ years ago.<p>I'm completely for technological progress, including full speed nuclear. Yet, without hitting the current nuclear establishment hard in the nuts, they wouldn't let the progress happen, and will be continuing to build, if permitted, these old designs, or nothing will be built at all. The human race thus is kept hostage - either old and dangerous or nothing. There is no debate whether nuclear is safe or not. It is just a PR of the existing industry trying to sell old dusty designs and their minor tweaks wrapped as the necessary component of the technological progress of the human race. The real answer is - existing nuclear is dangerous, costly, and huge portion of its cost is socialized (as typical for any monopolized industry). The nuclear energy, if/when it is developed using even existing today state of human race technology (not 50 years old) can possibly be made safe and very effective.<p>Edit: among my best hopes for advanced nuclear and thermonuclear is that Musk will need a source of energy on Moon, Mars, etc... and there is no nuclear industry yet capable to reach beyond the Earth to limit the progress there",1305575607

Perhaps there's a little ""+"" sign and when I click it, I can add a tag/title/description/picture\n- The app needs to be able to save your work for that user to retrieve later on.\n- The layout that a user is able to create in is sort of widget based where the user can add a new bubble and then in that bubble they are able to add text or content.<p>I started programming this with HTML5 canvas and Javascript, but I'm stuck on creating a connection to the database that isn't directly from Javascript (because that seems very insecure to me).

2553750,comment,2552740,2552740,2,0,petegrif,,,"I think the problem here stems from the fact that people talk as if ""software"" were one homogenous entity.  But as we all know - it isn't.  Some software is trivial and some isn't.  Some represents a trifling investment and some a huge investment of time and dollars.  Some is very easy to copy and some much harder.  It is only when we start thinking about such categories that we can make real progress thinking about where and when patents may be appropriate when they are not.<p>Let's stipulate that the USPTO is not perfect.  They do make mistakes.  Patents are issued that should not be.  But the existence of such patents should not be taken to be an inditement of the entire system.  Few systems are perfect, but recognizing this let's further stipulate that advocating tossing the baby out with the bath water on this basis alone is impulsive.<p>The difficulty is in drawing a line - defining innovations which deserve protection and those which don't.<p>Let's try a thought experiment.  Imagine you have an idea which you believe to be novel.  You research the field and it does indeed look novel.  You look into the problem.  It's non-trivial.  It is going to take man-years of work to put together an implementation.  But there's a problem.  The technology you have to use to implement it is such that it is extremely easy to copy your work.  You don't want to have to patent your work.  You don't want the time and expense.  Perhaps you have principled reasons why you don't want to patent it?  But let's consider your options.  If you don't get patent protection you are left with (a) trade secret (b) copyright.  We already know that a trade secret won't work because your work will be in a form that is easily copied.  Does copyright protect you?  No.  Why not?  Because copyright only protects the expression of the work, not the underlying ideas, no matter how novel and valuable they may be.  It is easy for a determined competitor to take your work and re-engineer it such that copyright is worthless.<p>So what are you going to do?  That depends on who you are.  If you are a huge company and you still don't want to patent it you can go ahead and develop and publish your progress so that it is in the public domain and a competitor can't patent in the area.  You are relying on your market strength to carry the day.  But what if you are a small company?  Are you prepared to risk everything with no protection?  It is risky enough anyway starting a company, as we are constantly reminded, but if you can so easily be ripped off, isn't it wise to think twice?<p>It's your decision.  You may have philosophical objections to patents so strong that you just don't proceed.  That is your right.  But if someone else decides to proceed it seems to me that it is perfectly rational for him/her to seek patent protection.  It would be crazy not to.  There is plenty of recent precedent of large companies ripping off small innovators even when they have patent protection!<p>IMHO to evaluate 'software patents' as a class is dangerous.  Our industry is too big and the use cases are too various for such generalizations to be helpful.  It is only by considering categories of innovation that we can hope to make progress on patent reform is such reform is needed.  A knee jerk 'all software patents are the work of satan and should be trashed' doesn't help any more than a strident declaration of IP rights by well financed patent trolls.",1305572739

Looking at the measurements reported, (both from TEPCO and other agencies) there isn't an indication of either groundwater or watertable contamination.<p>[update: The TEPCO folks early on said they <i>did</i> see some groundwater contamination with Iodine. They also point out that the plant is 'downstream' of the water table with any nuclides most likely being carried to the ocean rather than to either of the rivers higher in the water table. The engineers will know more when they open things up and start cleaning them out.]<p>The 'news' is that cleanup will take longer because rather than pulling fuel pins out of the reactor and sending them off to be either re-processed or disposed, the core material at the bottom of the reactor will have to be removed piecemeal by what is probably custom equipment.<p>This was the same procedure used at TMI to remove material that had migrated to the bottom of the reactor after having melted.<p>I don't think anyone disputes that this was a tragic event and at seems nearly the worst possible accident (it could have been worse if all reactors were at full power) but it hasn't killed anyone yet, this incident is unlikely to be the principle cause of death for anyone in the forseeable future. And yet tens of thousands of people are dead because they couldn't flee the wall of water, so the tsunami <i>was</i> a disaster, the damage to the nuclear plant <i>was not</i>.<p>When you see a head-on collision and the person in the car walks away because the airbags went off, we don't argue for banning driving because the car is destroyed, there is $50,000 worth of damage to the guardrail, and hundreds of people lost work because they were caught in the traffic jam. We say, ""Isn't it amazing how safe cars are these days! That accident would have killed them even 10 years ago.""<p>We have had a head-on collision between a late model nuclear reactor and an incredibly and extremely unlikely large magnitude double disaster and so far, the safety systems that were built into the reactors and upgraded over the years have kept everyone safe. Slowly, steadily, and with good engineering practices.<p>The results of that disaster are being addressed and will be cleaned up and repaired. I realize that someone walking away unhurt from what would have been a fatal collision might feel that it was a miracle, but it might just have been good engineering.",1305572604

An area will be uninhabitable for a while.<p>Lessons learned: nuclear power is pretty darn safe, although you shouldn't build 50s-style reactors near the coast in a tsunami zone. If you do, don't live nearby. No surprises there.",1305572550
2553734,comment,2552183,2552183,1,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"By far my most heavily used program is KEdit which is a PC version of the IBM VM/CMS editor XEDIT written by an IBM guy in Paris.<p>In both cases, there is a macro language based on Mike Cowlishaw's Rexx which is elegant.<p>Why such heavy use of KEdit?  I am a heavy computer user, and, except for Web browsing, nearly all my computer input is via typing.  So, the first issue has to be, what software to type into?<p>Well, I don't want to type into just a standard graphical user interface (GUI) 'multi-line text box' 'control' because the functionality is meager.<p>Yes, I'm a Windows user:  So, in particular I don't want to type into Outlook or Visual Studio.  Since my most important work is applied math, I use TeX for that and for all my high quality word whacking; so, I don't want to type into Word.  I use SQL Server Management Studio for data base 'browsing' but won't type anything important into it.<p>So, here's much of what I type into KEdit:<p>(1) e-mail to send,<p>(2) input to TeX for mathematical and high quality word whacking,<p>(3) blog posts such as this one,<p>(4) notes on everything I want to remember in programming, shopping, equipment repair, medical care, financial records, phone numbers, addresses, abstracts of Web pages -- everything,<p>(5) software source code, including T-SQL for input to SQL Server,<p>(6) most of my important program test input,<p>(7) looking at program test output,<p>and more.<p>E.g., a little KEdit macro does my telephone dialing.  Another little KEdit macro types mailing labels.<p>More?  I'm developing a Web site; it's my first serious HTML programming.  Since I'm a Windows user, I'm using ASP.NET.  Well, I want some good logging for the Web site.  ASP.NET has some default logging, but I didn't like it.  Well, .NET also has some lower level tools for logging; these tools do handle the important issues of multiple threads of multiple programs on multiple machines all writing to the same log at the same time.  Good -- that's the crucial functionality I needed.<p>So, now I have some good data logging.<p>Since the log file is 'circular', the first thing to do when reading one is to sort it on, say time, date, and machine.  And with multiple log files, there can be some duplicate lines.  In using the log files it can be important to 'select' lines based on the user's IP address, the name of the Web page, the routine in the Web page that wrote the line to the log, the message number of the message within the routine, etc.  Sure, all this can be done with relational data base, but for log files of reasonable size it can also all be done more easily just within KEdit, especially if write a few KEdit macros.<p>So, I look at and do the first cut analysis of log files just within KEdit.<p>To be clear, on the title of the article 'On The Flight to Old Text Editors', I never left my ""old text"" editor.  I've been using KEdit or XEDIT since 1985 and was using good text editors before then.<p>Alternatives?  I see no good alternatives.<p>Why?<p>Well, the article lamented:<p>""That a new generation of programmers flocking to these old tools is concerning, if for no reason more selfish than the desire for peers in my dissatisfaction.  Without a consensus that we can do better, there’s no incentive, no motivation, no market for improvements.  If as modest a step towards a better editor as TextMate is abandoned, what hope is there for a true leap forward?""<p>Well, there's been no ""true leap forward?"" apparently mostly because of the overwhelming theme of the 'graphical user interface' (GUI) from the bean bag chairs and 'cognitive psychology' people at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) and the use of GUI ideas by Apple, Microsoft, X-Windows, and now, with further development, smart phones.<p>In particular an important special case has been the Web and Web browsers.<p>The PARC goal was to make computer interaction easy for the pre-school children of the PARC employees for future Xerox office machines, and the approach was to have a user interface much like that on, say, a microwave oven.<p>So, with GUIs what we've got is for pre-school children using microwave ovens, and that's not promising for a ""true leap forward"".<p>So, the assumption in the computer industry has been that humans should interact with computers via a GUI, almost exclusively.<p>For a user mostly just receiving information, maybe that assumption is okay, but, for a user generating information, no.<p>The good text editors were designed by some of the best programmers ever for use by some of the best programmers ever.  So, it's no surprise that good programmers prefer good text editors.<p>Bluntly, for generating information, it is still very important to type, and so far for people doing a lot of typing a good text editor is by far the best software to type into, in particular, much, Much, MUCH better than any of the check boxes, radio buttons, text boxes, and multi-line text boxes of the GUI standards.<p>In particular, for programming, I've been doing that for a long time.  I've always found programming to be fast, fun, and easy giving the input just via a good text editor.  I could count on one hand all the times I got any benefit from 'interactive debugging' tools.<p>So, I tried Visual Studio.  I saw a window with many 'panels', and I could never find what all the panels were for.  Some of the panels were said to be 'dockable', and the intended meaning was obscure and not in my copy of Webster's.  The one little window was cramped, and in strong contrast when I program I typically have a dozen or so windows open at once, using either KEdit or my favorite Web browser, for entering source code, for documentation, for earlier versions of the program, for other programs I can use as samples, for various notes, for program output, for searching for information on Google, etc.  The one cramped window from Visual Studio is, in comparison, a bad joke.  For just the typing, Visual Studio gives me just some little panel within the one window, and KEdit is MUCH better.  It's easy to write powerful macros in KEdit, and I do, and I saw no promising way to write macros in Visual Studio.<p>When I saw that with Visual Studio the work is to be a 'project' and even a project to report ""Hello World"" starts with 50 MB, I concluded that Visual Studio was from the far side of Xerox PARC in luna-land.<p>For my present development I'm mostly using just Visual Basic .NET via a script program from command line text windows.  I'm thrilled:  The complier is fast, easy to invoke, gives good error messages, so far appears to be essentially free of bugs, and generates surprisingly small EXE files.  Terrific.  What's in the Visual Studio 50 MB has to be glop, gorp, and goop I very much don't want to have to work with when things go wrong, and with that much glop, gorp, and goop some things are very likely to go wrong.<p>So, yes, I do a lot of typing and do my typing into the best text editor I know of, KEdit.",1305572546

3877660,comment,3877179,3877179,2,0,moocow01,,,"""Learn to program"" is probably going to be a repeated answer here but I'm not so sure this attitude is going to be doing any good.  Enticing people into technical professions that do not have the inclination is not going to make things much better - instead your going to end up with a significant band of people disinterested in their work.  We all know how much ""negative"" work can be done by bad apples in software.<p>The problem is that everyone has natural competencies, personalities and cognitive methods and only a relatively small sliver have the type that will fit software development.  If you think I'm saying were special, I am not.  Every discipline has a relatively small sliver of people who will be naturally inclined to do it and enjoy it.<p>The real problem is us... meaning society.  We currently aren't culturally organized in a manner to take advantage of everyone's abilities and part of the main reasoning I'd say is a lack of diversity in terms of what is appreciated and rewarded.  From my limited perspective our culture seems to have a maniacal focus on money and a growing monoculture that is focused on how to become a millionaire at whatever cost.  Right now software development seems to be a good way to get rich partly due to our monoculture's love of video games, apps, business processes etc. so our industry gets green lit for now so to say.<p>The problem is that there is a lot of important stuff to us humans all living a better life that the majority falsely considers unimportant and lowly for the most part because of its current low correlation to the almighty profit ... things like culture, art, anthropology, farming, geology, architecture, care-taking, etc etc  The sad thing is that we have swaths of people with great skills and inclinations that should be going into these different segments but essentially can't because we collectively don't appreciate people doing these things.<p>In other words if you ask me our real jobs problem is that we don't have diverse enough ""consumers"" who appreciate the interesting niches different humans fill.",1335164372
3877659,comment,3877191,3877551,11,0,adrianhoward,,,"You don't have to replace all of Adobe CS to compete with Adobe CS.<p>Not many of the folk I know with CS actually <i>use</i> the vast majority of it. For example I do almost no print work. All the stuff Adobe sweat over for the print folk - doesn't impact me in the slightest. In fact it gets in the way of the stuff I need to do since it adds complexity to the UI.<p>In the Mac land a bunch of folk are switching to paid tools like Pixelmator and Acorn as alternatives to Photoshop for some work. They don't replace everything that PS dues, but offer what a subset of the PS audience needs for a substantially cheaper price with some arguably better functionality in a few places. I know people who have CS <i>and</i> Pixelmator, and spend most of their time in the latter and just bring up CS when they need something ""clever"". Both Pixelmator and Acorn seem to be doing very well for themselves - and I think both are still single developer shops.<p>What nobody apart from Adobe seems to be really doing is the ""suite"" part - managing the integration well. For example - I would part with $200 in a heartbeat for a micro-suite that handled bitmap and vector work together  to the same level that Pixelmator managed bitmap stuff, with some nice glue/plugins to support where I work (web apps, mobile apps, pushing out multiple resolution versions, etc.).",1335164348

It does, however, do a nice job of getting around the fundamental problem of finding <i>some</i> environment that's reliably and consistently available.  It also nicely end-runs the problem of trusting a remote site to hold your data in confidence.<p>There's the remaining problem of key management, though for many people, browser-based password managers are a reasonable mechanism.<p>PGP/GPG and TLS still provide key management issues (with several notable registrar incidents in the past year).  And even if you're, say, parking a public key on a site to autoencrypt material sent there (assuming it's not encrypted prior to upload),  there's the question of how you're going to interact with encrypted data on that site.  I see three basic options:  server-side encrypt/decrypt, browser-based, or client-side non-browser utilities.  In the latter case, you now have a wide range of environments (Windows variants, Mac, Linux, etc.) to support.<p>Not saying it can't happen, but good crypto is hard.<p>Even the pros (PGP) ended up using a server-based solution which had <i>both</i> public and private keys on it as their solution to the key-management problem.",1335163083

This phrase is a distortion of the ""liberal education"" (that included calculus, biology, chemistry, and physics) provided by universities of the past.  From what I can tell, universities used to have a much smaller student/professor ratio, and had a bit more ""disciple"" in the study of a particular discipline.<p>Presumably that ended with the G.I. bill, but no one particularly minded because factory jobs were plentiful.<p>So when baby boomers of yesteryear look back at their college experience, and try and figure out what they got out of it, can they point to stellar education that they use every day?  If they majored in Communications, probably not.  Do their jobs require collegiate-level knowledge or skills?  If they're in marketing or sales, probably not.<p>So they remember that they smoked their first joint there, and met that one foreign kid from Uzbekistan, and throw in the first awakenings of independent thought that come from living on one's lonesome for the first time, and call it a ""cultural experience of self-discovery.""<p>I malign communications and the so-called liberal arts a bit, but that's not completely deserved.

1163827,comment,1163758,1163758,0,0,alexandros,,,"Being in Digital Ecosystems research myself, I would say the author is missing one important point: Absence of single points of control and failure. Natural ecosystems are rarely if ever dependent on singletons (single species or single organism) to be sustained. Their adaptivity and resilience comes from that one fact. All the examples the author states are tied to a single corporate entity, often designed so, and therefore cannot exceed the lifespan of the entity that created them. A great example of that is napster. Once the central entity was shut down by way of courts, the ecosystem evaporated.<p>In a sense the Internet and the Web are much closer to the true Digital Ecosystem, even though purists such as myself  can still find things that can be improved, single points of control/failure etc. but at least they are not as pronounced as the ones present in the star-topology twiter/amazon/apple ecosystems.",1267612724

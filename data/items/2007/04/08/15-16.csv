You can tell some of them(Adobe) know this because they're buying webtop application(Macromedia) companies to stay alive.<p>I just wish Flash would work better on Linux instead of worse.<p>And if I ever buy another prebuilt computer, it probably will be a Mac, since Linux doesn't get the same recognition or money for its similar market share.\n",1176046733

It is not dead by any means and still exists in the game. <p>You point out some reasons Microsoft why is ""dead"":\n \n""AJAX and Javascript is the new programming model of choice""\n I am currently developing a web 2.0 venture namely UReporting. Our Project is based almost entirely on Microsoft technologies. We had the option to use both LAMP based development or ASP.Net/ MS Sql. We chose Microsoft as it served all our needs and then some. Mapping, mobile, streaming, AJAX, Scalability, Community building you name it we are doing it. \nI have nothing against Javascript or AJAX but I can assure you Microsoft technologies can do everything that AJAX or Javascripting can. Also Ajax for ASP.NET is widely avaialable and used. This is a view not from someone who funds ventures but an actual entreprenuer seeking to minimize costs and develop a scalable and efficient platform.<p>""Buy all the good ""Web 2.0"" startups. They could get substantially all of them for less than they'd have to pay for Facebook.""<p>Interesting point especially coming from someone who funds such venture... <p>In conclusion, While microsoft is definately facing some challenges today (normal for all major businesses), there is no indication they are even close to where you claim them to be.<p>Have a Good Day<p>Danial Jameel\nwww.UReporting.com\n",1176045354

When you have Google as the #1 search engine being used within Microsoft and iPods as the #1 music players being used by Microsoft employees, I find it very hard to believe they don't know they suck.<p><a href=""http://www.techweb.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=189500876&cid=RSSfeed_TechWeb"">http://www.techweb.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=189500876&cid=RSSfeed_TechWeb</a><p><a href=""http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/commentary/cultofmac/2005/02/66460"">http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/commentary/cultofmac/2005/02/66460</a><p>\n",1176044976

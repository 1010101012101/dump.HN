From my personal standpoint Sharepoint is really quite lacking in features. Yeah, it has a Wiki -- but it's no comparison to the likes of say, DokuWiki. Yeah, it has a forum-like portion -- but you could probably pick any of the top 10 forums available for free on the Net and it'd be 10x more powerful than what Sharepoint offers. It's also an online file manager -- with searching and ACLs built-in. Not exactly ground-breaking stuff here.<p>To pay for this kind-of stuff when there's far better options online and for free seems almost ludicrous to me. Not to mention a terrible waste of money.",1213246620

215656,comment,214584,215279,0,0,RichardPrice,,,"Andrew, I think that's a really good point about the pot calling the kettle black.<p>It’s an assumption in Buffett’s argument that Helpers don’t create value; they just take a portion of the pie. This is a fine assumption to make in an imaginary world, but what it requires is that any opportunities that Helpers invest in, and which go on to create value, would have been spotted by the Gotrocks family. So the Helpers don’t spot any new opportunities; they merely charge for advice on investments that would have been made by the Gotrocks family anyway. How applicable is this assumption to the real world? In the real world, there is no such all-seeing Gotrocks family that spots every new business opportunity that arises, and allocates appropriate capital accordingly. If there had been no venture capitalists (who are one kind of Helper) to invest in Sergey Brin and Larry Page when they were starting Google, say, there is no real world Gotrocks family who would stepped in and invested in them. In the case of Google, the VCs did not just take a portion of the pie that would have been created anyway. The Helpers here are partly responsible for the value that Google created.<p>The actual distinction between a Helper and a non-Helper is not very clear either. If a Helper is an allocator of capital, then all companies are Helpers. VCs allocate capital by buying chunks of companies that, they hope, will create value. Microsoft, say, allocates capital by hiring programmers who, they hope, will create value. Is it possible to draw a distinction between kinds of activities that are value-creating, and kinds that are not? It is hard to see how one could. Perhaps one could try to argue that the activity of buying chunks of companies (as VCs do) is inherently less value-creating than the activity of hiring programmers (as, say, Microsoft does). It doesn’t seem that this argument could work even in principle, as a company that hires programmers, for instance, will frequently pay for them with cash that they have raised from VCs. If the programmers hired by the company create value, the VC is partly responsibility for that.<p>Buffett’s argument is beguilingly simple, and it took me a while to think through what its assumptions are. When you think it through, it really does look like the key assumption is that Helpers don’t create value. And it seems that this assumption could only be true in Buffett’s imagined world if all business opportunities invested in by the Helpers would have been invested in anyway by the Gotrocks. This is the point where Buffett’s model fails to apply to the real world; there is no real world counterpart of the Gotrocks that would find and invest in business opportunities if Helpers did not exist.",1213246102

Buffett invests his own money and doesn't sell his stock: he started the Buffett Partnership with $100K of his own savings.  His gains or losses are proportionally equal to that of his investors.  I guess maybe the original limited partners had it different (Buffett probably got a larger share of Berkshire for his $100k than the limited partners got), but I doubt any of them are complaining now.<p>Investing in Berkshire Hathaway is ""Heads we both win, tails we both lose.

If, on the other hand, you believe that the future of personal computing is ""in the cloud"", then it is a crazy boondoggle that tries to attach obsolete technology to the Internet.<p>If, like most of us, you think there isn't an absolute truth on either side, it's probably a relatively effective stopgap measure until Microsoft actually figures out the Internet.  History would indicate that they will figure it out, eventually, and history indicates that a large segment of the market probably won't come around until sometime after Microsoft does.<p>Personally, I think that, in the case of the Internet, Microsoft misunderstood it for far too long, and they've lost their chance to make the rules (thankfully--I've been in the in the technology industry long enough to know that when MS makes the rules, everybody else suffers, including consumers), but they'll still be able to mark out plenty of territory for themselves.",1213244669

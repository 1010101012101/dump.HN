I don't believe it takes guidance from the site owner to see why this practice is bad. It should be very clear to just about everyone that it's sneaky and does not enhance overall HN content quality. Not every example of sneaky, degrading behavior should need to be explicitly addressed in the FAQs.<p>As for the question if it's a good idea to Ask HN whether you should Show HN, I don't see any legitimate reason to do this. If your project is bad and unworthy (or just unlucky), it will get ignored and/or flagged. I know, because it happened to me, too. Several times, actually. It's a great signal to stop working on a project.<p>But chances are, your project is actually pretty nice and it will end up on the front page. There is absolutely, positively no need to ask whether you should show - other than to increase your visibility and circumvent the duplicate link mechanism.<p><i>> tons of Show HNs that no one (except you) complains about</i><p>I realize that in this, like in many other things, I might be utterly alone and that posting fake Ask HN items is actually considered a great hack to improve your exposure and everybody thinks it's just awesome.<p>That's OK. I'm just a random guy stating his opinions. I tried to explain why I think it's bad and why I think people who are doing that are abusing the system. While I would never personally upvote or engage with such an entry, it's totally possible that nobody else sees a problem here. In fact, I'm pretty sure pg and admins don't see a problem there, or measures would have been taken to prevent it. Nevertheless, I feel the need to say what I believe is right anyway.<p>It's up to you to decide whether I'm right or not.",1368363222

Selecting five rows from one (sharded) table and the looking up matching five rows from another (sharded) table by primary key is almost just as fast from the application as it would be done by the database itself.<p>Additionally many NoSQL databases let you store arbitrary number of data in a row, so you don't need (big) intermediate join tables.<p>However, I agree that a database can be much faster when you want to join two huge datasets, because then it has all the fancy ways of fast joining with sort-merge-join or hash-join, etc. But if you need to join huge datasets, you're screwed anyway, because such joins don't scale at all, and are still really, really slow - they need to do at least one sequential scan (and typically 3) over each full dataset. Definitely not something you want to do in your OLTP app.<p>I saw an OLTP app where joining a few thousand rows (yeah, thousand, not million!) killed the app performance totally, up to the point that a <i>single</i> user using the app had to wait >10 seconds for a page refresh.

(Ignore the fact that python doesn't have types in the function signature to start with, say you're reading the documentation instead)<p>If you knew that color was of the enum-type <i>my_gui_lib.standard_colors</i> you know exactly which colors you can use and you can reuse them for fill_ellipse also because it most likely uses the same type. Instead of every function having to reiterate all valid integer values of color or referring to some table. Your editor will also provide you with auto complete of valid values unless you're coding in notepad.<p>In a type safe language you will even get compilation error if you provide a type/value out of range but since python is dynamic this would be hard.

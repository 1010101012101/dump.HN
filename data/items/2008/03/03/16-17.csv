You must be in San Francisco.<p>This is a simple business that can <i>easily</i> grow to make $1mm a year (and with some work, $5mm/year). I will help you understand how to grow and run a business.  I am focused on OpenDNS these days and EveryDNS has been neglected (though we added AAAA support on Saturday night).<p>In addition to the business side of things, I will also teach you about networking, routing, BGP, and every other aspect of running a world-class global operation that provides a necessary service to the Internet.<p>Contact me directly -- david at ulevitch dot com.",1204563572

128140,comment,127675,127675,0,0,geebee,,,"This depends on the situation.<p>There are times when an ""employee"" is really a founder, but the founders don't want to admit this.  Even if there is a salary, the financial situation may be very unstable (ie., making payroll may be an issue). This is often the case for very early employees, and seems to happen most when non-technical founders are hiring their first progammer.  In this case, I think the founders should really be either bringing on a technical person as a founder or paying a contractor.  It's a sign of a pretty clueless bunch of managers, either way.<p>The other situation (which I am in right now) is when you have a fully functioning ""startup"".  The business may not be cash flow positive, but it's been around for a while, has a stable funding base, a product, and probably some customers.  In this case, a very small bit of equity is reasonable, because the employee is really working for a salary, plus a chance at a nice payout (maybe up to a mil, but no more than that).<p>My advice is that you evaluate the company - they need to be in category 2 for this offer to make sense.<p>By the way, I agree with you that the risk can be ""greater"" in some situations for the employee than for the founders.  The founders have more control over the exit than the employees do, and they'll see trouble coming from much further out.",1204563205

You don't need to worry about complicated web-related tasks such as handling asynchronous calls, that is all abstracted for you. You can layout your pages like you would a Swing or SWT desktop app and that should get you started.: <a href=""http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/</a><p>GWT is a higher level of abstraction than most other frameworks, which some like and some do not. The top-most layer is actually not coupled to anything specific related to javascript, DOM, or HTML in general. DOM manipulation and javascript are treated much like in-line native assembly code in a traditional high-level language. You can develop an entire web application like GMail without ever seeing anything below this high level abstraction. This may make it sound weak or limited, but its actually very powerful b/c you can focus on building rich functionality rather than debugging erratic cross-browser quirks.",1204561317

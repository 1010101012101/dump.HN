528621,comment,528300,528603,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"I agree about the collusion bit but for another viewpoint<p>""Measurement alone is not enough. An example of a job with measurement but not leverage is doing piecework in a sweatshop. Your performance is measured and you get paid accordingly, but you have no scope for decisions. The only decision you get to make is how fast you work, and that can probably only increase your earnings by a factor of two or three.<p>An example of a job with both measurement and leverage would be lead actor in a movie. Your performance can be measured in the gross of the movie. And you have leverage in the sense that your performance can make or break it.<p>CEOs also have both measurement and leverage. They're measured, in that the performance of the company is their performance. And they have leverage in that their decisions set the whole company moving in one direction or another

That said, if you wrote the contract to include disclosure of source code you should be able to legally ask for it. That said, $2500 is a relatively small amount when we're talking about a complete system with source code rights. Your best bet is likely to file for small claims (usually costs you between $25 and $250 depending on the amount, and you can only file for up to $2500 here in Florida). You likely will not make it to court, and he'll settle. Why? Because everyone fears litigation, especially when they're wrong.<p>Next time around, write the contract the way you want it to read, and account for failures. Make certain everything is in writing, even if there is a deviation agreed upon by both parties.

528603,comment,528300,528300,0,0,dejb,,,"One good alternative explanation of CEO salaries is by analogue to sports stars. Most people can see the impact of hiring a standout player for a team. There may a huge pool of competent players but a team full of mediocre players will most likely lose. Paying the big bucks for the best players can make sense. In a free market the amount paid to stars will be close to the perceived increase in profits that having them will provide. I'm surprised I haven't heard this argument made.<p>Of course running a company is a lot less transparent than sports so people can't really judge if these CEOs where ever talented enough to justify these wages. Certainly the performance of their 'teams' has lead to doubt of the value of their talent.

The bombs (old fashioned, dumb bombs) would then fly in a parabolic trajectory like you'd expect and land somewhere near the target ;)<p>If I remember correctly this tactic was actually used in combat with surprisingly effective results.

528578,comment,527363,527436,0,0,Lightbody,,,"(Note: I'm the founder of a cloud-based load testing provider...)<p>Well, there are a lot of reasons why cloud-based load testing makes sense beyond scripting. But specifically about scripting, I believe that the cloud actually _does_ make script creation MUCH easier and script playback MUCH more realistic. Here's why:<p>Traditional load testing tools emulate HTTP traffic. Their recorders watch the protocol-level traffic a browser makes, and then poor engineers have to disassemble the traffic to make it appear as if thousands of users are coming from one machine.<p>They end up writing regex expressions and other such logic which effectively emulates the more expensive parsing a browser does. Often times, especially with rich AJAX apps, they end up duplicate much of the same code written as JavaScript to run in the browser, but this time inside of their load tool. For an example, see my article on why load testing is hard when it comes to AJAX:<p><a href=""http://ajaxian.com/archives/why-load-testing-ajax-is-hard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ajaxian.com/archives/why-load-testing-ajax-is-hard</a><p>With cloud-based scalability, a new opportunity is here: to ditch the old ways of load testing and actually use real browsers. Scripts become way simpler because you're no longer scripting complex protocol-level traffic, but instead scripting simpler user behavior. And the script playback becomes more authenticate because you are guaranteed not to have a bug in the protocol-level playback, error reporting can show you what the user actually saw with screenshots, and the traffic pattern is realistic (two connections per host, etc).<p>Of course, not many providers are doing this (yet). My company, BrowserMob, is. Thanks to the cloud, instead of allocating 2GB and 2 CPU cores to a load test, we might allocate 2TB and 2000 CPU cores. But because it's elastic usage, our cost is still low, so our prices stay low too. All of the scripting is done with Selenium, an open source browser automation technology I am a contributor for.<p>If you're interested in trying it out, we provide $100 worth of free trial credits:<p><a href=""http://browsermob.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://browsermob.com</a><p>Besides the browser vs virtual user stuff, there are definitely plenty of other reasons why the cloud is a great way to do load testing, but I think those have already been touched in the comments.",1237818393

That should show us something -- and please don't assume that I mean all users of these techs fall in here, because I know that very intelligent people use both -- but Rails and Mac both seem to attract arrogant, know-nothing hipsters.<p>That said, frameworks are a pain when they're overused, but they're handy, even in advanced apps, when you simply consider them as a set of macros and convenience functions instead of an entire philosophy.

The model you are assuming sounds a lot like the type used for chess program. I played along with the 'culling algorithm' bit for the sake of convenience. But I'm not sure there is good enough evidence to assume that as the underlying model.<p>The definition of speed I am using is analogous to the clock speed or memory retrieval speed in a computer and it does seem at one level to be the way you are thinking of it as well. I think this fits in with what the researchers are measuring.<p>> The reason I didn't mention the possible variation in working memory capacity was a single word that I left out, leaving it, like I said, to the Computer Scientist: ""exponential.""<p>The memory requirements of a particular algorithm don't necessarily grow exponentially with the solution space or the input data. As with time complexity common space complexity relationships to the input size are n (you need to store at least the input), nlog(n), n^k and k^n. Most tractable problems would be nlog(n) or at worst n^k where k was small. The implication of this is that often small differences in memory can make a huge difference. Possibly you are forgetting that every extra bit of memory 'exponentially' increases the number of options it that can represent.<p>One of the first things you learn in CS algorithms is that the an efficient (let's say nlog(n)) algorithm running on a very slow computer will beat an inefficient one (say n^2) on a much faster computer. Sometimes resources such as memory will make the difference between being able to use an nlog(n) rather then a n^2 algorithm. To me this is a good analogue to apply to intelligence. For particular classes of problems (the harder ones) the better algorithm will trump a faster processor. Having a store of 'right algorithms' probably has a lot more to do with intelligence than raw thought speed.<p>Your view seems to be that the fundamental thinking algorithm is a fixed tree-pruning-like one. If it was then yes speed would be the main differentiating factor. I think this is the crux of our disagreement.",1237817079

Does the amount of money handled change the difficult of the work?</i><p>I think this is an interesting aside in the article.  Seth seems to be arguing that it's the same work, but it really isn't.  The amount of money handled does change the difficulty.  First, it's going to require more trips to move the money and that is increased labor.  More importantly, the risk goes up the more money you're transporting.  Maybe those changes are small.  OK.<p>The real difference comes in the value to the firm hiring you.  If you're being entrusted with $1M vs $100K, the firm has a greater interest in making sure you're good at your job.  Loosing $1M because you hired a poor driver is worse than loosing $100K because you hired a poor driver.  Likewise, when we're talking about hiring for a CEO, a firm will want the best since they're entrusting that person with the livelihood of the firm.  His or her job may be no more difficult than anyone else's job, but the firm has a high interest in making sure the CEO is competent.  An incompetent person in an entry-level position is unlikely to be in a position to do the damage that an incompetent CEO could do to the firm.<p>So, by paying high salaries, firms hope to be able to take their pick of managers and get the most competent.  However, firms have yet to show that they are able to determine the competent from the incompetent.  So, at the moment, most firms are simply paying high salaries to whomever is good at politicking and showing themselves in a good light regardless of actual competence.<p>There is a theory behind it and it's not just marketing.  However, the fact that firms have proven unable to filter the competent from the incompetent limits the applicability of that theory.",1237816813

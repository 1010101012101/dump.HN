In fact, Greg Mortenson's organization (The Central Asia Institute) has built dozens of schools since then.

And what you accomplish is not linear with the number of hours you put in.

I don't have a cite for this with me, I'll track down a reliable source later to be sure. I know for instance that Greg Mortenson's does. Most also do independent audits every few years.<p>#2: In many of the most isolated areas, even if they 'know how to build buildings', local custom requires gender segregation, and building a girls' school isn't a budget priority, but if someone else pays for it, families will gladly send their children to school. \nSome areas of rural Afghanistan and Pakistan have had skyrocketing rates of female education once additional schools were built.<p>As with any foreign aid, throwing money at the problem isn't the answer (and lucrative large-scale construction projects rarely are either), it's how the aid is deployed and used.

Houses in Kenilworth, IL have a lot less to worry about from crime than do houses in the Edgewater neighborhood in Chicago, but that's not because the houses themselves are intrinsically more secure. Would you argue someone should move to Edgewater instead of Kenilworth if they're worried about crime?",1242252833

If true, this change would further the problem because even less real votes from the new page would be occurring.<p>To test this possibility, randomly reserve some of the places on the front page for new stories (perhaps in the bottom half).

The other two times we replaced the memory and solved the problem.<p>Of course Macbooks can crash. There's very little Apple can do about defective parts and physical damage, other than to very effectively service their gear, which is something no PC OEM has figured out how to do.<p>Macs have an intrinsic reliability advantage over PCs. It isn't that their OS is more reliable --- it isn't; in fact, even inside the kernel, Win32 is more resilient than OS X. It's that for 99% of its users, Apple is the sole supplier of both hardware and system software.<p>Within the OS architecture that OS X and Win32 share (monolithic kernels with driver code running as native unverified instructions in ring zero), and given the current state of the art, there is nothing Microsoft can do to negate that advantage. The only thing that can happen is for Apple to fuck it up, by sourcing crappier parts than the average PC OEM (not happening), or by providing poorer support than the average PC OEM (not happening).<p>Sorry.

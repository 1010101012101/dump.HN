At that time, the exemption was $675,000 and everything beyond that basically got taxed at significant rates, obviously affecting a lot of middle class people. If the tax is allowed to revert to the old rates in 2011, there will likewise be a significant impact on middle class people. That is why the politicians are squirming and why the exemption amount will likely be increased for 2011 and beyond to something that excludes many such people from the impact of the tax.<p>By the way, I have worked as a business lawyer with family businesses since 1984 and am pretty familiar with their concerns in this area (for example, in almost desperately trying to use vehicles such as family limited partnerships as a way of trying to avoid or minimize this tax and thereby preserve their businesses for their kids on death). Those concerns are real and they do not apply simply to the ultra-rich (who, by the way, have ample mechanisms available to them - e.g., foundations - to bypass the estate tax altogether).",1262188351

1022538,comment,1022430,1022430,0,0,gecko,,,"This argument is absurd.<p>All functional languages have mutable global variables.  Most provide explicit support for mutable values (e.g., Scheme, OCaml), but even in the ""pure"" ones, there are the secretly global mutable values.  Clojure gets them from its STM and from classes in the JVM.  Erlang stashes them in ETS, DETS, and Mnesia.  Haskell shoves them into the IO and State monads (among others) and hopes you won't notice.  In all of these cases, the variable changes may be isolated, threadsafe, or internally consistent, or however you wish to describe it, but if that's not mutable state at a global level, I don't know what on Earth you'd call it.  In all cases, this means that a function called twice in a row from the same point in a program may return two different values--and that's <i>exactly</i> what the author is saying is a flaw of imperative languages.<p>Turning things around, while it's theoretically possible that any given function mutates global state in random ways, no good program is written that way.  Instead, the relevant state is passed to a function in the form of a struct or class--exactly what you'd be doing in a functional language, as it happens.  The only difference is that the function can, and sometimes does, mutate the structure passed to it, whereas the functional equivalent would likely return a slightly different version of that struct.  But, again, a combination of passing things conservatively, naming functions well, and making heavy use of const/final/sealed/what have you to lock things down makes this problem largely absent in practice.<p>I am not saying that functional programming can't a huge improvement for some things.  I am utterly convinced that a multithreaded program should be written in a functional way, if not in a purely functional language.  I likewise tremendously favor functional languages for algorithm-heavy applications, where the ease and safety with which I can backtrack and memoize can yield huge productivity gains.  But saying that all imperative programs have hundreds of arguments, while functional languages have only those defined?  Unless you do no output with the outside world, that claim is simply ludicrous.",1262187130

In the measly 174 days (actually longer, just didn't create an account) I have been hanging out around here and enjoying your company, insight, intelligence and humor, I might have missed this topic being discussed.<p>I think the YCombinator news aggregator, the quality of the submissions and the quality of the community compel me to news.ycombinator.com as the first stop when I want some intellectual stimulation. Some visit gossip sites when they have a down minute or bored moment on the internet, I turn to you and here.<p>But what brought the majority of core users here--if I may assume--was YCombinator the firm, which kicked off this community with like-minded people who set the tone that this will not become a site for spam, memes, or flames, rather thought provoking and conversation provoking news, information and discussion.<p>YCombinator ""the firm"" is a trusted venture group that funds the early stage startups--something utterly invaluable to economic growth.<p>So I ponder this: Digg has struggled with monetizing their site (something that is a must for their long-term survival) and you can make your arguments as to why. BUT, I do not believe that YCombinator would have the same problem. Why? Because they do not need to monetize this community off-shoot they created to survive. In fact, I'm sure they have absolutely no interest in  making money from ads here whatsoever.<p>So, instead of serving ads for the purpose of monetizing, what if for the purpose of funding?<p>Huh? What? Yes, for funding. What if that money was put into funding startups in some way shape or form? Either traditionally or rewarding startups for winning contests?<p>I'm sure there are tax and business implications in doing this, but throwing out a ridiculous idea isn't always ridiculous.<p>Lastly, there seems to be a very niche (yet diverse) demographic that uses this site which would yield higher rates to collect on ads and I'm sure we can trust that YCombinator wouldn't place irrelevant ads in our face. I'm sure there are a few businesses/entrepreneurs in this community alone who would want to buy time/space.<p>I leave you with that and hope that I did not 1. repeat something that has been discussed a million times before and 2. wasted your time.<p>Cheers,\nJames",1262185894

I think I have a sense of humor, but I downvote fluff jokey comments unless they're screamingly funny.<p>A good example is yesterday, there was a post that got a <i>lot</i> of upvotes before it died -- it was an image with a 6 by 6 matrix of programming languages, and each slot had a funny image macro-y picture showing how proponents of language X felt about language Y.  I flagged that thread.  (If it were a comment, I would downvote it.)  Well, why did I do that?  It wasn't terrible, although it was only a little bit funny.<p>I did it because there are literally a million places on the internet where I can look at pictures that are a little bit funny, and only a handful of places where I can have a serious discussion about things that I am actually interested in.  I believe the problem with throwaway jokes is that they're so easy.  Among 1,000 average readers, perhaps 5 of them have an insightful comment about, i.e. a new feature in R6RS Scheme, but 500 of them could easily post a silly joke about parentheses.  Result?  If you try to talk about Scheme you get 495 jokes for every piece of expert commentary.  Not cool.<p>(Realistically, there are many other kinds of comments that are problematic in this way.  For example, it's easy to religiously stick to one big general paradigm and zealously apply it to everything, so you wind up with some of that.  It's easy to attack people instead of confronting complicated ideas, so you wind up with some of that.  I think it's just a consequence of less-informed but social people trying to find an angle by which to contribute.  Sometimes I'm guilty of this myself!)<p>Based on my experience in other places online, it looks like a really, really, really slippery slope, so I err on the side of throwing out all fluff.",1262185223

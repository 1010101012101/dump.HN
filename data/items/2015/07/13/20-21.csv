You can foster a culture of innovation by doing things like giving away theater tickets, giving them time to do whatever the heck they want without proposing anything and seeing if anything useful turns up, and generally giving them more leeway to screw off, not less. The minute you try to slave <i>innovation</i> to results, you kill it. It just dies.<p>I wish I could recall the name of a book or article or something. I cannot. Innovation is about putting different things together. You want to foster creativity by getting people doing different things and then find a way to capture the value. If you try to determine first if it has value, this will not work. It is a little like the idea that for brainstorming sessions, it is critical that you NOT pass judgment. You just toss out ideas and write them down, no matter how wacky sounding. Then you judge them LATER. Creativity and innovation need to be born of a situation with few constraints. These things do not perform on command. Milking them for value has to come at a later stage.<p>Start hobbyist type clubs at work. Have social events for people to meet and greet. Get cross connections going. Give away tickets to theater or other enriching experiences. Feed the creative process. Don&#x27;t try to make it &quot;productive&quot; from the get go. Capturing value has to be a later step in the process.<p>Best of luck.",1436821011

Steve Jobs allowed Edgar Schein to have teams of his grad students follow Steve around and record every conversation and interaction. But Schein made one mistake - He gave Steve the right to veto the final book which was produced. When Steve saw that the book was almost exclusively about him, and didn&#x27;t put him in a positive light, he refused to let it be published. So Schein rewrote the book into &quot;Organizational Culture&quot; - it is famous because it coins the term &quot;corporate culture&quot; - and it mostly describes Steve and how he created a culture of innovation (even though the examples are based on other executives.) When I read the book while working for Steve it was amazing - it described Steve with incredible accuracy (though, unfortunately, it lacks good examples since Schein couldn&#x27;t describe how Steve handled specific situations.) For me, the book was like a master class in creating a culture of innovation.<p>In hindsight, I&#x27;ve often wondered how the benefits of a culture of innovation could be created without the derangement of Steve.

You are referring to the BFED extremists whilst the article is maybe referring too much to the cool frontend extremist.<p>I work for a large medical company in its platform department and for any third party package or framework we definitely consider if it is really worth adding it, or if we can do this ourselves. Sure, things like sass we take, as we do with grunt. But we have serious issues managing our resources (fte) and backlog items. Many teams, even within our company, all want a different new cool technique. They want angular so we made directives on our UI toolkit. Another suddenly used dojo so we made wrappers for that as well, next we had ember, backbone, and soon angular 2.0 no doubt. We test the angular directives with jasmine, the JQuery with QUnit, and have saltarelle in the party as well.<p>Next come the just out of beta frameworks as meteor, sure you can work with meteor and our REST api services but minor support is only officially added in 1.2 (not even out yet). O, less is much better than sass, give me less, no wait typescript! You are missing out if you don&#x27;t use react! O, and nodejs and Mongodb not postgres! We hear it many times, as many as we have customers actually.<p>My point, there is a middle ground here. Teams have a limited amount of resources and you have to balance the supported techniques with actual functionality.<p>As always, choose the techniques that work for you, not what is trending (new)  or well backed (old) just because.

However that is almost NEVER the case (even if you have the tools, you still have too many edge cases). Case in point, I&#x27;ve been troubleshooting a Windows CPU usage issue recently. Our monitoring wasn&#x27;t catching all of the disparate processes, so I couldn&#x27;t see what was eating it up. Plus I would pull the node from the ELB prior to investigating, which then caused it to no longer peg CPU.

So many (here included) constantly shout negativity towards these technology concepts (SPA, in this case), and thankfully also citing what they&#x27;re negative specifically about.<p>What i&#x27;m surprised to see though, is that so few focus on improving the tech concept (SPA). I see so many complaints, but so few fixes. I don&#x27;t think SPA is inherently bad, not by a long shot. It&#x27;s just that, like any young idea it is far from perfect. But, that&#x27;s technology! It&#x27;s how advancement goes.<p>As technology goes, we tend to take two steps forward one step back. But it&#x27;s often for the sake of _progress_. I have a Moto 360 on my wrist as i type this, but do i consider it amazing? God no, it has some nifty features sure, but it&#x27;s massive and i can&#x27;t even see what the time is without turning it on.<p>Take that in for a second - i have a watch and i have to turn my wrist and bring it up to my face to see the damn time. But do i think that it shouldn&#x27;t exist? God no. When i got my first &quot;smart&quot; phone it was also awful. If i followed the (seeming) mantra of these negative people, i&#x27;d have been shouting for no smartphones phones and no smart watches for years before they had a really solid UX.<p>I understand a MPA currently offers a more reliable and overall better UX than SPAs tend to. However, can we please focus on improving this technology concept rather than screaming for them to not exist anymore? The HTML5 History API attempts to solve many of the complaints here. It also sounds like we should use data caching (in our SPAs) so that when a user hits back, they get a back-like experience. And as far as scroll position goes, that might be something the History API should provider (if it doesn&#x27;t already).<p>Like it or not, JavaScript is here to stay. Usage of it will only increase. Rather than saying how terrible of a UX it has, please try to think in the reverse. Even if you aren&#x27;t going to work on the solutions, this is the exact type of crowd that will.

There&#x27;s a free system called PACER which allows you to download the filings for any federal court case, but it costs about 10c/page (although you can get a certain # free every quarter). As you can see form the link above, litigation generates a <i>lot</i> of paperwork so if you&#x27;re interested in a case you can easily run up a large bill on PACER. Usually people who are interested in litigation share key documents from a case because court filings are by definition in the public domain. But this is slow and unreliable and if you&#x27;re a law nerd the minor procedural filings are often as interesting as the important documents like the complaint or key motions.<p>The reason for the 10c/page PACER fee is to support the digital infrastructure required to provide it; Congress controls the budget for the federal courts an is notoriously stingy - perhaps because many members of Congress are unenthusiastic about funding another branch of government that has the power to strike down legislation - see for an overview of the funding picture <a href=""http://www.americanbar.org/advocacy/governmental_legislative_work/priorities_policy/independence_of_the_judiciary/federal-court-funding.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americanbar.org/advocacy/governmental_legislative...</a><p>State courts are a whole different ball of wax. Some have everything online, others don&#x27;t.<p>One other thing to be aware of is that if you&#x27;re interested in a particular case and you want to know what happened at trial - with all the exciting (?) cross-examination and &#x27;Objection! overruled,&#x27; moments the court transcript is <i>not</i> an official court document. The court reporters who produce them are hired by the attorneys and they charge a small fortune for copies. Now, because the trial is public domain the transcripts are almost certainly in the public domain too (this is law in the 10th circuit and I don&#x27;t think it has been contested elsewhere). So if you can find a copy of the transcript on PACER* or one of the parties&#x27; websites, you&#x27;re likely free to use it. The court doesn&#x27;t hire reporters because they charge a lot - it&#x27;s a very skilled job that&#x27;s not so easy to automate as you might think - and the transcript only has legal value in the event of an appeal, whose benefit would accrue to one or other of the parties rather than the court itself.<p>Some courts have audio recordings of the trial available for free or relatively cheap, and many appeals courts, including the US Supreme Court, have recordings of oral arguments that are available for free. As data storage becomes increasingly cheap then full audio copies of trial proceedings will probably become the norm, but if you are listening to one then you&#x27;ll quickly realize why court reporters charge so much.<p>* You probably won&#x27;t find it on PACER because appellate courts generally don&#x27;t want or need to see the entire trial record, but sometimes you can. Be careful if you do, transcripts often run for hundreds of pages and you&#x27;ll be billed accordingly.",1436818506

It was soon obvious to many that the sale had been premature, the site was unmanaged and under-resourced under the old-media giant who simply didn&#x27;t understand it and could never realize its full potential, so the founders and their allies in Y-Combinator (where reddit had been born) hatched an audacious plan to re-extract reddit from the clutches of the 100-year-old media conglomerate.<p>> Together with Sam Altman, they recruited a young up-and-coming technology manager with social media credentials. Alexis, who was on the interview panel for the new reddit CEO, would reject all other candidates except this one. The manager was to insist as a condition of taking the job that Conde Nast would have to give up significant ownership of the company, first to employees by justifying the need for equity to be able to hire top talent, bringing in Silicon Valley insiders to help run the company. After continuing to grow the company, he would then further dilute Conde Nast&#x27;s ownership by raising money from a syndicate of Silicon Valley investors led by Sam Altman, now the President of Y-Combinator itself, who in the process would take a seat on the board.<p>> Once this was done, he and his team would manufacture a series of otherwise-improbable leadership crises, forcing the new board to scramble to find a new CEO, allowing Altman to use his position on the board to advocate for the re-introduction of the old founders, installing them on the board and as CEO, thus returning the company to their control and relegating Conde Nast to a position as minority shareholder.<p>> JUST KIDDING.

This means less than 10% of the money has reached the people of Greece.&quot;<p>Furthermore, there&#x27;s a common misconception that the Greeks are lazy, but the statistics show that they have the longest average working hours in Europe, and their average retirement age is not that different from the rest of Europe.<p>As for Argentina, yes they&#x27;re not out of the woods yet, but since their economic crash they&#x27;ve had impressive growth. IIRC it&#x27;s been the fastest growing economy in South America recently, I&#x27;m sure I could find the stats if you disputed this.<p>So, with all this in mind, why do you think more loans is the answer?",1436817996

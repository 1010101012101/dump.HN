See <a href=""http://www.xspf.org/quickstart/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xspf.org/quickstart/</a> for more info. Since you are sharing links to videos, distributing them into a standard format could be a good idea for instance.<p>Or hook it to the YouTube API, to provide more info about each video.

That would have been boring. Plus as we tried to explain, at some point you have to let go and not micro manage every individual stat and app. I'm sure if we did that we could make some more money by optimizing, but that's not what our business approach was about. We wanted simple, stress free which gives us time to do other things. We're not experts, we don't have a degree in business or anything like that.

Both are pretty similar, way expensive (waits for someone from NYC to comment).  Boston is actually a bit more expensive than the bay.  If you are willing to commute 45 minutes into the city the prices do drop quite a bit, but who wants to do that.<p>Diversity.  Bay area is much more diverse than Boston.  Being a white kid from the suburbs I had never had thai food nor known someone from vietnam before moving the Bay.  Boston is a really young city, tons of colleges, so you do have a good mix of cultures in those crowds.<p>Smart People.  Boston is full of them, but really so is every other city.  There are a lot of schools here, so there are plenty of smart people.  You will have no problem finding smart people in Boston/Cambridge.  All of my friends are driven, but I do not think thats because of the city, its mainly because of who I choose to hang out with.<p>Family. I'd probably want to move out to the burbs for that.  Cambridge can be a bit of a young crowd, crowded, etc.<p>Feel free to ask any questions.",1288915218

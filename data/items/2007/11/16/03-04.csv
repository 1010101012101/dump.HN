We need to rearchitect our backend in data warehouse + MOLAP terms, and ActiveWarehouse is too young to bet a company on. So, time to learn a new platform and rewrite everything. :P<p>\n",1195183916

It works for some people; And since it is only code at the end of the day, you can always get to the bottom of the magic if you do a little digging.<p>While we are on the topic, I have always wondered why the Django team insists on being an MTV (Model Template View) framework..don't you guys think just conforming to MVC would make life easier for people new to Django?\n(This is a serious question)",1195183363

80502,comment,80502,80362,0,0,adrianh,,,"I think you'll find that the stuff Django does behind the scenes is <i>quite</i> clear, with very few exceptions. The basic parsing of HTTP requests is dead simple, and although the code for the ORM is hairy in places, what really matters is the SQL it generates, which is pretty clean. And like somebody else said, there's nothing that says you have to use the Django ORM.<p>One of the nice things about Django is that it's just Python. You can always look at the import statements in a module to see <i>exactly</i> what code is being run and where it's coming from. I've never used Ruby on Rails, but I have the impression it can be opaque in this area. (""Just create a file named makeasite.rb and put the single word 'create' in it, and Rails will do the rest!"")<p>Personally, I'm vehemently against ""magic"" in a framework / programming environment, which is one of the reasons I love Python -- and one of the reasons we don't have a lot of magic in Django.<p>Let me know if you have any specific questions.<p>Adrian (Django cocreator / core developer)",1195182555

The translations of Google Translate are made from machine learning and are completely inaccurate.<p>Besides that, I agree that I&#x27;m pissed off at Google but not for the same reasons, the main reason is they are way too much powerful and I think it&#x27;s dangerous for our &quot;civilization&quot; to depend so much from a large company.",1429981194
9438850,comment,9437516,9438104,0,0,eli_gottlieb,,,">The advantage of interviewing employed people is that you have a better chance of hiring someone that is competent.<p>I think I have to call Base Rate Neglect Fallacy here.  Being already-employed may be evidence that someone is competent, but without knowing the strength of that evidence (ie: how many incompetents get hired <i>anyway</i>) and the base rate of competence/incompetence among all job-seekers, employed or not, we can&#x27;t really say much about whether it&#x27;s a good practice to poach rather than hire from the general pool.",1429981182
9438849,comment,9438739,9438739,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> I can’t understand if programmers can view Rect as Rectangle, why others can’t?<p>Programmers use an abbreviated version of the word in contexts where it&#x27;s common. This phenomenon is pervasive in English; if a long word gets used too frequently within a community, that community will often develop an abbreviation. But &#x27;rect&#x27; for &#x27;rectangle&#x27; is not used generally because, outside of some specialized areas, it&#x27;s quite rare to refer to rectangles at all.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t bother changing the title. Some people will laugh, but the connection they&#x27;re making is enough of a stretch that nobody should be embarrassed to refer to your game, and many people won&#x27;t see any issue at all unless it&#x27;s pointed out to them.<p>Counterfactually, if you had a game called &quot;Wrecked &#x27;em&quot;, that would most likely be interpreted as a purposeful reference to &quot;rectum&quot;, and it would be worth changing if it was unintended. &quot;Rect Pusher&quot; may not be perfectly idiomatic, but I don&#x27;t think it will cause problems.",1429981160

C++ has RTTI and .NET shipped with reflection as a fundamental construct...)<p>I need to write code that talks to libraries today. I press dot and within 10 milliseconds I see an encyclopedic list of functions, complete with verifiable hints as to their structure. I type what looks like it makes sense, run the compiler that takes as much time to compile than python.exe takes to load, and a lot of the time, if the code compiles it just runs perfectly.<p>I do not need to wade through verbose Doxygen boilerplate, nor page through source code, nor dance around fake json schemas. I do not need to write unit tests that, in many cases, serve merely to exercise the interpreter to make sure it hits everywhere I might have forgotten a parenthesis. It just friggin&#x27; works because a community has decided it&#x27;s important to do things this way.<p>So many of these &quot;time-saving&quot; languages are a full decade behind this reality. Right now it&#x27;s definitely <i>not</i> enough. There&#x27;s 30 years of idiotic cruft behind Windows bitmaps and it&#x27;s STILL faster and easier to resize a jpeg in C# than using the insane Python libraries.<p>Meanwhile C++ got &quot;auto&quot; and C# got &quot;var&quot; and &quot;dynamic.&quot; At that point I picked my winners, there are of course other options.<p>And when I <i>write</i> a library, doing it this way just seems like basic human respect. Sure: you&#x27;re welcome to the source and here are some lovely docs. But if the only way to say whether something takes a string or bytes and that it varies between Python 2.7 and 3.x is in a README file, something&#x27;s gone wrong.

I would use PHP because it&#x27;s informal - it&#x27;s a hybrid between shell and C so expressiveness and speed come basically for free and there isn&#x27;t much friction.  Being able to quickly iterate often makes relationships become apparent at a meta level.  For example a quick lookup of a parsing error might reveal that the data was generated by a standard tool, so I could drop what I&#x27;m doing and grab that instead.  It&#x27;s not so much about individual choices, but a way of attacking problems that compounded over time leads to a great deal of leverage.",1429981127

I tried twice to get an engineering degree (electronics and CS) but I am too lazy when it comes to studying boring stuff on a <i>structured</i> manner. On my third attempt (age 23) I decided to water-down my aspirations and simply get a BS with a CS and Math focus. I had been programming for fun since age 15 (an Atari 130xe with a Basic cartridge) so it was natural to do it for money. Naturally, like any <i>real</i> professional, I started learning everything that I know AFTER graduation, using my clients as ginea pigs. I never wanted a job per se so the degree was more of a social fulfillment rather than a pre-requisite to start a professional career. I turned down job offers and opened shop right after graduation.

9438833,comment,9438577,9438577,0,0,bazillion,,,"Career:  Programming/Creating a startup.<p>I was an Arabic linguist at the NSA, and would input certain numbers I&#x27;d hear into a tool.  Whenever I heard a specific one, I was supposed to add 9 to it and put that number into the tool.  This drove me insane, because I kept asking why I had to add 9 myself, instead of the program just doing it (since I could describe the rule myself).  I started putting in trouble tickets every few months, but they were all ignored.  At one point, I just decided I was going to fix it myself, and approached the guy who made the tool and asked him for permission to modify the program to fix it.  He handed me the O&#x27;Reilly Perl Cookbook, and said to go to town on it.<p>I ended up finding out in the code how to fix the problem within the first day, and started thinking about other ways I could improve the program to make our lives easier.  I made all sorts of improvements, and my cubicle neighbors saw this and asked if there was any way I could make a tool for simplifying their manual process.  I got to work on it, and quickly whipped out something that stored all of their entries for later review.  The big problem at the time was that I didn&#x27;t have any basic knowledge of CS -- I didn&#x27;t even know what a database was, so I built a system of just storing all of the text in flatfiles and using Perl&#x27;s Tie::File to turn the files into dynamic arrays.<p>I started making program after program, and what drew me to my career was walking by someone&#x27;s computer and seeing the program <i>I</i> built on their desktops as they were working.  Eventually, the entire division of 80-90 people were all using my programs for their day-to-day, and I had to quickly learn a lot of hard lessons about putting things into production.<p>So, in short, I think the big reason I chose my current career was that I always loved building things that people not only wanted to use, but thanked me for building them because of how much easier it made their lives.  There is nothing more satisfying (to me) than building something useful and having people who use it think you&#x27;re a modern day magician.",1429981016

I started out as an electrical engineer, though.<p>When I was doing my undergrad, I didn&#x27;t really like programming.  I took many of the core CS classes, though, because I really wanted to do embedded development.  I just wanted my degree to be electrical instead of computer engineering because I felt an EE was going to have an easier time getting a job in the rapidly imploding dot-com bubble.  Plus, I actually liked the physical aspects better; one of my two backup plans was to become an electrician.<p>When I got into a real job, though, I discovered real-world programming was more interesting than what I was forced to do in class.  Additionally, I got introduced to the world of FPGA and CPLD programming.  While my first position was hardware production support, I pushed to move towards signal processing.  After 3.5 years I managed to switch programs.<p>Unfortunately, the program I switched to turned out to be a black hole.  It was a DOD program that required special clearances to work on.  I found out much too late that this effectively made me a prisoner of the program because getting people cleared was so difficult and expensive.  Furthermore, I could say so little about what I was doing that I could hardly get interviews, let alone sound competent in the few I did get.<p>I took my current job out of desperation.  I had been searching for over two years and basically took the first offer I was able to get, which was a small local company.  It was a domain I had never worked in (NLP) in a language I had never worked in (Java).  It has worked out pretty well, though I can&#x27;t get as interested in NLP as I was in signal processing.  Unfortunately, I think I am trapped again as I get recruitment pings about once every two weeks from my new world but can&#x27;t get the time of day from companies in the old one I left reluctantly.",1429980210

It was also great fun to make infinite-loop batch files that printed out some vulgarities on screen when the instructor wasnt looking.
One day, when walking into a class, an older (maybe 15?) guy in corner of the room (who turned out to be a sys-admin) drew my attention: he had a bunch of weird text on screen in some program I&#x27;ve never seen before (all i knew was &quot;copy con mytext.txt&quot;).

With great support from my parents - who - and i&#x27;m still not sure how - found the means to get me a PC at home (those cost many months of salary at the time) - i started tinkering with graphics, windows, and random computer stuff.

9438726,comment,9438577,9438577,0,0,nickbauman,,,"I grew up in a software company. Mom worked for a German company that designed embedded software used in automating sea ports and satellite tracking / telemetry. Mission critical kind of stuff. The company would hire developers from all over the world and they would come to Germany and often live with us for a couple of weeks before finding their own place. So many of the engineers became &quot;big brother&quot; kind of friends to me. One of them gave me my first computer. A Sinclair Spectrum 48k. I started using unix (running on a VAX) at work playing with their kit, too.<p>Mind you I didn&#x27;t want to become a computer programmer at all. I would come home from school and stop in at my mom&#x27;s work and all these engineers would be sleeping under their desks because a port worker had been killed when a container ship struck a pier or a satellite entered low-earth orbit and flamed out costing $100 million or something. I associated programming with tragedy and high stakes.<p>So I went to art school. My senior year I was spending more time in the computer lab than anywhere else. We had a lab populated with Silicon Graphics workstations and I&#x27;d written scripts to render my animation across all the machines so I could get a result in minutes instead of hours. Then the web became deregulated.<p>Lately I found my way into working on rail automation software that had safety critical requirements. Which is exactly what I never wanted to do and so I quit after 3 years.<p>I&#x27;m still in the industry and haven&#x27;t figured out what I want to be when I grow up.",1429978777

That said, I also don&#x27;t think the benefits of patents should be interpreted so narrowly, or that we should judge patents by the single criterion of their &quot;actual&quot; intent instead of these other benefits.<p>The other benefit is that it enables companies to do innovation where they would not have been able to keep the idea secret in the first place.  E.g. a pharmaceutical drug whose chemical composition would be trivial to reverse engineer.  In that case, the patent does not serve the purpose of making the knowledge public in exchange for a monopoly.  What it does do, though, is incentivize innovation be rewarding the inventor with the &quot;rights&quot; to that idea.<p>The real problem with patents is when patents are of trivial things that anyone could have thought of without much effort.  That is why I don&#x27;t support any software patents, because it&#x27;s so much easier to patent trivial things in the software world than the physical world.",1429978723

We now have a team of about 15 engineers, but we still have few more open positions.<p>From our experience, resumes usually are not a good predictor of anything we care for. The only useful thing it tells us is what firms the candidate has worked at, and what those groups were doing while the candidate was there.<p>When a candidate comes onsite we spend significant time showing a demo of our product, what our groups ambitions are, discussions to understand what the candidates career goals are etc. We also have the standard white-board interviews, often attempting to design a small feature on our product. This takes significant effort on our part. Before investing this time, we will prefer to see some code from the candidate.<p>The candidate is offered an option to show us (1) some code they wrote which is out in the public domain, OR (2) some code from their employer (if their employment terms allow it) OR (3) solution to a small coding question we provide. Our coding question takes about 4-5 hours of the candidates time.<p>This process has worked very well for us. We have been able to screen our candidates with very impressive resumes who wrote horrible code.

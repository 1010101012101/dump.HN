Saying ""Welcome to..."" doesn't really tell me why I should be on your site.  I need to know what's in it for me, otherwise, I'm heading off to another site.  I would also de-emphasize the logo (eg. make it smaller) and emphasize the search box more.<p>On your search results page, I would change the label of the ""submit"" button to ""Search"" and remove that secondary search at the top right.  If you need that global search for some other page than the search results, I would suggest adding a button to the right of the text field and label it ""Search"".<p>It would also be a good idea to add a ""you-are-here"" indicator on your tabs.<p>Colors could also use some polishing.

Early when cable was released in my area there was high burst rates but bad latency - so back then I went with a dsl connection that had lower band width but better latency.  These days though the latency is low enough on the cable connection in my area that I can play FPS perfectly fine.<p>From the article it sounds like the were able to play an FPS like Crysis just fine.  FPS seems to be the gold standard, if you can run an FPS you can play any other type of game because they don't have the same type of split second reaction times.<p>It definitely sounds like an interesting system to try.

Never let past slips become an excuse not to exercise today.  Too many people try really hard until they miss a workout, which creates a bit of a letdown, but they keep going, and then they miss another, which discourages them a little bit, and so on, with each missed workout weakening their resolve until they quit altogether.<p>This is because people only <i>want</i> the long-term goal of fitness, weight loss, happiness, and attractiveness.  That's all they think about.  They only feel positive feedback when they see their actions as part of a pattern that leads to long-term results.  This is logical, but it only works as long as you stay confident and optimistic.  Therefore, for many people, it's emotionally tenable.<p>An easier way is to forget about the long term results (to the extent possible) and focus on the short term.  If you want to exercise <i>now</i>, no matter whether it is part of a longer-term pattern of performance leading to life-changing benefit, then it's a lot easier to do it.  Your decision doesn't have to run a gauntlet of skepticism about your past and future performance.  Concentrate on appreciating the immediate benefits of a single workout:  you'll elevate your mood, feel better about yourself, <i>like</i> yourself more, burn some calories, and shake off some rust.  If you can't help thinking beyond today, just think that you're strengthening the behavioral and physical foundation for future exercise, which is all you can do today.  Let tomorrow's you worry about tomorrow's exercise.",1238010772

There's room for 'hidden variables' of a certain type in the decision making process of the experimenter and the state and process of the measurement apparatus. Having blind faith that important state is located there is perhaps unwise, and certainly it is hard to demonstrate, but assuming that the experimenters are entirely un-entangled and uninfluenced causally, that there's no interesting modified state in the experimenters or measurement apparatus at all, would, to my mind, also be a mistake.",1238008828

532271,comment,532030,532155,0,0,jerf,,,"Sure you do. If you care about exceptions, your callback routines or event handlers should use try/catch themselves. This is true regardless of the other machinery; browser event handling or higher-level library, the upper layers do not know what to do with a failing callback. Your objection is meaningless because it's true independent of what is being discussed.<p>Furthermore...<p><pre><code>      for (var idx in callback_array) {
         var callback_data = callback_array[idx];
         var callback = callback_data.callback;
         var error_handler = callback_data.error_handler;

</code></pre>
there is nothing intrinsic about ""not being able to handle your own errors"", either. (This is obviously simplified.) I don't think I'd implement, this, though; I'd say if you want to handle exceptions, handle exceptions within the callback.<p>Most implementations of callback loops suck, but this is the fault of the implementors, not the idea.",1238008692

I understand Guido and the Python team haven't explicitly stated that, but that certainly seems to be what they signaled.  I don't expect see widespread support until 3.2, with Python 3.1 likely being the signal for people to begin serious migration efforts.  As a Python developer myself, I couldn't move to 3.0 even if I wanted to: none of the open-source libraries I depend on have even begun to look into 3.0 support (Numpy won't even support Python 2.6 until its upcoming 1.3 release).<p>Besides that, from a practical standpoint I'd guess the Unladen-Swallow team wants a codebase on more solid footing, like the mature 2.6.x series, as opposed to Python 3.x which is in a greater state of flux.",1238008123

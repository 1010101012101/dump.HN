Having said that, I would like to make the following points:<p>1) From the experience of close friends, it is not an extra week. It is typically at least an extra month. Some times it's even longer.<p>2) It is not clear to me whether the extra time is being spent on improving the selection or simply being wasted because everyone on the committee has other things to do which introduces delay in reaching quorum+agreement.As an outsider there is no way for me to tell one way or the other, but it's something for Google to think about.<p>3) Humans hate uncertainty, especially in important life decisions. Many people, given a choice between an uncertain prospect of getting a job at Google and a certain job at a company that is slightly worse than Google, will choose certainty. And there are many companies who are not obviously worse than Google competing for the top talent.",1270515143

I suspect the army is actually held to higher moral standards than the average American citizen would choose to enforce.  Americans are strongly biased to empathize with our own troops' fears and frustrations and to blame Iraqis for any encounters that end badly.  For instance, in the case of shooting up the van and the people who tried to help the wounded man, we would say that they didn't do anything to identify themselves as not being insurgents.  Plus, they were clearly scared and in a hurry, so they knew they were putting themselves in danger and were therefore responsible for the consequences.  There are all kinds of ways to make excuses and avoid siding with savage foreigners against our poor scared boys.  Should Americans stand up to their government and demand what they want?  Between the opinions expressed by Americans on this page and the opinions expressed by the soldiers in the video, the (mythical and/or aggregate) will of the American people is closer to the latter, so mass democratic action would not help anything.",1270514796

Though the information was all public and available without any authentication, some people felt like it was an invasion or privacy and that others would use it to 'spy' on them. We could have actually used more telling and personal info, however, and chose not to - if someone was really interested in gathering data about another member, they could have done a lot better than to use our site.<p>Same principle, anyhow... public data made more accessible was considered a privacy violation.

It's exactly how and why I informed myself in the first place.<p>Even the title of the story is ""Apple says jailbreaking is illegal"". But it <i>is</i> regardless of what Apple said. It's a half-truth, and the half that's left out changes the implication of what is left. The lede repeats this. They also leave out the relevant detail that Apple's filing was a response to a proposed class of exemptions, not an activist effort on their part. Indeed, the relationship between the two documents is not made clear at all. Where you say ""and Apple responded"" in your summary, you're not getting that from the EFF's article. Read it again.<p>If the EFF claimed to be an unbiased news organization, I'd believe that it was a simple mistake, but they don't so I don't. They want to make Apple look like a big bad bully (which is their right and natural from their position, of course), but the way they chose to do so has perpetuated misinformation.

Do some reading on Shannon entropy for the details, but broadly, take the following example.<p><pre><code>  $ grep -c ee /usr/share/dict/words\n  10620\n  $ ^ee^hh\n  grep -c hh /usr/share/dict/words\n  132\n</code></pre>\nSuppose you're looking for a given word out of some arbitrarily defined set of words, such as a dictionary file.  Suppose further you're given either the clue that it contains the sequence ""ee"", or the sequence ""hh"".  There's a much lower probability of any specific one of the 10000-odd words in the set being the match for ""ee"" than one of the 100-odd for ""hh"". In information-theoretic terms, that probability gives you useful data, or <i>information</i>, about the word you're looking for.",1270512790

Drawing connections to specific utility can be done, but doesn't have to be done. For example:<p>Efficient markets -> lower transaction costs -> greater access to the markets by everyone -> farmer sells a futures contract to lock in price and hedge risk -> farmer uses capital to buy equipment -> farmer grows more crops<p>Your definition of utility is valid, but your desire to draw direct connections between end game utility is misplaced because there are millions of connections that can be drawn. Each market participant interacts with the markets according to their own definition of what is and is not important to them. You seek to define value for every human using financial markets in the world.",1270512053

pdkl95,,4112,2.20455,15,1284,"&quot;PDKL 95&quot;<p>1. (noun) - The drug used by the Superbrights as a means of forwarding Cataclyst[1] ideology. At high doses, the drug erases all sense of &quot;self&quot;, but can be used at low doses to force a change in perspective by violently disrupting the mind&#x27;s established, &quot;normal&quot; way of interpreting reality.<p>2. (noun) - The most efficient (and dangerously destructive) means of breaking out an established paradigm, into a different Prigoginic[2] Level of Complexity.<p>3. (name) - The internet alias of an insane nerd in the San Francisco Bay Area. A UNIX and Free Software advocate, who has been programming from a very young age. Expect a strange mix of very-traditional UNIX philosophy and technique, mixed with seemingly random or surreal tangents.<p>[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schismatrix#Ideologies<p>[2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Prigogine",1376134630,1452899068

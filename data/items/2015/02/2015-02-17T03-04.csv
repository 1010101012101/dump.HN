Tons of other places - like D.C. and Austin - are seriously hurting for good startup focused lawyers that aren&#x27;t huge (Cooley) or just word of mouth.<p>My suggestions are to start small with a web portal that has all the docs you need to get started or to quickly catch up if you are about to close financing. From there you can add your personal services.<p>For example, there is a lot written about term sheets but significantly less written about Note Purchase Agreements and Promissory notes. Even less is written about when you need to file a Part D and your Blue Sky provisions etc...<p>If you could build a dead simple interface that walks you through the documents you need sequentially and piecemeal like:<p>1.

US has 330 million people, and that we
<i>redistribute</i> the worth of those 1000 people
to the 300 million.  Then each of the 300
million will have money enough for a nice new
car, four years in college or graduate school, to
pay off their student loans, make a down payment
on a single family, three bedroom, two bath
house on a nice street, and won&#x27;t have to struggle
with a miserable job?  Will they?  Maybe?

The industrial revolution more or less replaced lots of relatively unproductive jobs with a smaller amount of much more productive jobs. There might have been more work, but individual people were doing more work as well.<p>> Technology provides leverage on ability and luck, and in the process concentrates wealth and drives inequality.  I think that drastic wealth inequality is likely to be one of the biggest social problems of the next 20 years.<p>Wealth inequality is already a huge problem, and has been for a long time. I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s going to be worse in the next 20 years, given in a lot of countries (China, India, etc.) we&#x27;re seeing wealth flow to, or be created by, a growing middle class. A lot of the &#x27;Occupy&#x27; movement was somewhat misguided - the percentage of people in the United States or Australia or the UK who are in the 1% worldwide is perhaps as high as 20% or 30%.<p>Software, rather than hindering, may very well help people in rapidly developing nations generate wealth because the economic barrier to entry for software businesses is comparatively low compared to other types of businesses.<p>I&#x27;m also a little concerned that it seems as though many people believe wealth redistribution is the only way to make it more equal. Why can&#x27;t we create wealth in some places? As far as I understand, wealth is not finite.<p>Once we get to the point of widespread AI-driven automation, then we&#x27;ll have a real economic problem. It won&#x27;t be just because people can&#x27;t generate wealth - people may very well begin to lose wealth. But this is a 50-year problem, not a 20-year one.",1424144896

A computer can &#x27;verify&#x27; that a certain move is good or bad. That&#x27;s fair enough. But in the past I have seen players (of lower skill level to me) discuss analysis in for example, a battle between two bigname players.<p>I have sometimes wondered if these discussions are truly honest because I have seen moves made by top players that I  don&#x27;t even understand how they arrived at the process of deciding that was the correct move vs others. Excluding GMs, a human simply cannot prune the game tree at depth like a computer can.

In an ideal world it would be nice if neighbours didn&#x27;t spy on each other, but in the real world, everybody spies.<p>2. Yes, clearly they do, and also alter the course of some very dangerous activities a la Stuxnet and Iran&#x27;s nuclear program. Just because it&#x27;s possible to circumvent these measures, doesn&#x27;t mean they shouldn&#x27;t be use either. Firstly, you&#x27;ve made it more difficult for terrorists and other parties to communicate effectively, which is already a win. Secondly, they will of course be updating their methods as well. I doubt very much that what we&#x27;re seeing here is the be all / end all of NSA&#x27;s capability. This is implied in the article, where the group hands down certain exploits / technologies for actual implementation, but tends to keep things back. A blow, to be sure, but I doubt we&#x27;ve seen it all yet.<p>3. ISIS are <i>not</i> the result of the Iraq war. It&#x27;s very important to understand that ISIS are simply the most recent manifestation of a fundamentalist Islamic sect known as Wahhabism [1]. As convenient as it is to blame them on simple cause and effect, the reality is, as always, far more complex. Essentially this is a group of ultra-fundamentalist muslims, who have for a long time been part of Saudi&#x27;s political structure. What we are seeing now is a return to their radical roots, backed by disenfranchised and poorly educated muslims across the Middle East. These are people who were left out of the massive oil money influx during Saddam&#x27;s regime, and are now fighting tooth and nail against any and all transgressors - muslim and Westerners alike.<p>If anything this makes a case for the NSA&#x27;s activities, not against it. It&#x27;s not the US&#x27;s meddling that caused these issues (although it certainly hasn&#x27;t helped); these are deeply ingrained philosophies in Middle Eastern culture. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;d rather have a very good understanding of their power structure and where they&#x27;re putting out feelers, than not.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alastair-crooke/isis-wahhabism-saudi-arabia_b_5717157.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alastair-crooke/isis-wahhabism...</a>",1424144456

9060481,comment,9058705,9058705,0,0,dfan,,,"Using &quot;number of pawns of evaluation lost&quot; as a proxy for the severity of the blunder has some fundamental problems. The main one is that the relationship between evaluation in &quot;pawns&quot; and expected result (expected value of the game result, from 0 to 1) is not linear. (It couldn&#x27;t be, since one of them maxes out at one.) It&#x27;s actually more of a sigmoid curve.<p>This means that a player may easily make a horrific &quot;3-pawn blunder&quot; reducing his evaluation from +8 to +5, but in fact all he&#x27;s done is reduce his chance of winning from 99% to 98%. Actually, the +5 move may even be better in practice, in that it might lead to a sure safe win rather than a tricky blowout.<p>Even if you changed the definition of blunder from &quot;reduces the evaluation by n pawns&quot; to &quot;reduces the expected result by x&quot;, I would have an issue in that it ignores any of the human aspects of blunders. If someone drops a pawn outright for no reason (eval change -1), that is a blunder because it was so trivial to avoid. But if someone, even a grandmaster, makes a move that causes a large drop in eval due to allowing a sacrifice that no human could calculate all the ramifications of, because as far as he (and probably his opponent) could humanly calculate it didn&#x27;t lose, it is hard to call that a blunder. (Conversely, failing to see some immensely complicated non-forcing winning move may be unfortunate but it&#x27;s not a blunder.)

Interestingly, the same skip-gram algorithm is used for both even though it&#x27;s applied to datasets as disparate as a social graph and a sentence structure. There&#x27;s a bit of cleverness here: the authors equate a sequence of social network graph visits (a random walk in DeepWalk) to a sequence of words (a sentence in word2vec.) In both cases the resulting representation is dense while still preserving many relevant properties of a social group which makes it useful as an input to other ML algorithms. Incredibly interesting.<p>I wonder if there&#x27;s a simple but powerful example (like king-man+woman=queen for word2vec) of this technique.",1424142734

3378389,comment,3377660,3378251,5,0,bradleyland,,,"The fact that the author references 600 dpi, then displays the image at 1:1 reveals that he really has no idea what he's dealing with. To further complicate matters, the author's source image is an already anti-aliased bitmap. Re-sizing this image in order to test appropriately on varying screen resolutions will result in anti-aliasing errors. The test images should be rendered at target resolutions from a vector based format like SVG.<p>This is what the test image looks at zoomed to 400% with no anti-aliasing and no additional processing. This is a pixel-by-pixel resolution of the mess at the center of that image:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/WeoI4.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/WeoI4.png</a><p>When displayed 1:1 on a device, that mess will show up.<p>DPI is dots per inch. This is an indication of resolution density. When you scale the display of an image on a fixed size screen, you also scale the DPI. That is to say, you could use a 1 million DPI image, and still, when displayed at 1:1 on a smartphone, the DPI of the resulting image is the same (the extra pixels are clipped outside the boundaries of the screen).<p>Keep in mind that this test pattern should appear like a fractal. No matter how far you zoom in, the pattern will look the same. The points at the center should scale down to near infinite resolution. The resolution limitation is only that of the display device.<p>A more suitable test that gets closest to the hardware would work something like this:<p>* Start with an SVG test pattern<p>* Record the native resolution of each device in pixels<p>* Render the SVG test pattern with no anti-aliasing (or at least consistent anti-aliasing) at each target resolution<p>* Display the image on the device using a custom developed application that disables or avoids any internal scaling or image processing capabilities of the software<p>* Observe the results<p>If you wanted to test the rendering capabilities of the entire software stack, you should still start with an SVG and use whatever built-in components will render SVG.<p>Starting from a large bitmap tells us how well the bitmap scaling software works, but you shouldn't zoom to display at 1:1. You should allow the software to resize and see how well it scales.<p>Each of these is another step removed from the core question asked in the article: Does the pentile screen impact image quality? To answer this question, we must rule out other factors, such as software rendering capabilities.<p>The final error made is that of attempting to capture the results with a finite resolution capture device (a camera). At a pixel level, your capture would need to greatly exceed the resolution of the target display in order to examine the results at a pixel level or to reproduce the image in a way that objectively represents the perceived result to an audience not present at the time of testing.",1324490255

3378380,comment,3377525,3378114,1,0,geebee,,,"I'd be interested in seeing the breakdown of work-related vs non-work related immigrants.<p>Even so... my point above (about the RAND study) is that objective research shows that Americans are avoiding STEM graduate degrees for rational, market-driven reasons.  While it's wonderful that high skill immigrants are innovating, patenting, and starting new firms, that may simply reflect the declining appeal of STEM fields to people who have a wider choice of career paths (ie., if we make it easier for smart immigrants to come here as STEM workers than as lawyers, it's not surprising that immigrants show a higher activity in STEM than in law).<p>The US may be locking itself into a vicious cycle - the appeal of STEM careers declines, so Americans begin to choose other fields.  This creates a shortage, which leads to an increased call for more visas.  This provides a stopgap measure that prevents the market correction that would might make STEM more appealing (relative to law, medicine, etc), causing even more Americans (well, anyone with choice) to avoid the field, which leads to calls for even more visas...<p>In many ways, I hate making this argument, because on a personal (moral) level, I feel immensely welcoming to immigrants, especially well educated immigrants who make a wonderful contribution.  And as a matter of policy, yeah, it'd be nuts to refuse entry to such a remarkably productive workforce - the US is in trouble economically, and the fact that so many top people still want to come here is one of our best cards!  But at the same time, when I set aside my emotions and take a cold, rational look at this, I do think that the emphasis on STEM immigration may very well be deterring young Americans (or, again, anyone here with the ability to choose a profession over STEM) from entering the field.  And I believe that this could be dangerous to the US in the long term - sure, it's stupid to turn away our top graduate students, but shouldn't we see it as a crisis that so few of our graduate students in STEM fields are coming up through the ranks of our own educational system?<p>I hope you can tell I feel a lot of ambivalence about this.  I don't ask people to agree with me, I just ask that people recognize that this issue is complex, and absolutely is not a ""no-brainer""",1324490123

It's armchair litigating. Rovio could absolutely file a case against this developer. How far it would go would depend largely on the judge in the case. You can bet that Rovio would, if they decided to, file with a court that historically rules in favor of their position. This would mean that, at a minimum, this developer would have to retain counsel and pay the thousands of dollars it would cost to get the case dismissed (not a slow process). There would be depositions, discovery, inquiry, and a slew of other bullshit that comes along with being sued.<p>You see, this is how the game is played. It's not a matter of who is right or wrong. It's not even a matter of what the rules say. It's a matter of who has the bigger bank role to pay for attorneys that are good at playing the game.<p>I know because I've been in this scenario.

Hardly third-world.<p>But in any case, your problem is solved very easily- by firing people. At a previous job we hired a guy with a Masters from a college in New Jersey (I forget which, sadly). He was useless. We fired him. Education can get you in the door, but it can't keep you in the room.<p>The problem with this is that hiring immigrants is more expensive and time-consuming because of the process you have to go through. Although it sounds backwards, if it was easier to hire immigrants it would be easier to fire them when they aren't as good as they say they are.",1324486842

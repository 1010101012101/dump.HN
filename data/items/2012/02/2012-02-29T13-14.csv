Most of the fights are utterly forgettable (corridor, enemies, your gun, their gun, repeat, end dialogue), the Mako was the worst vehicle ever driven in a game and firing probes on planets - no word about that. When the gameplay actually worked and was interweaved with the storytelling (for example the possibility to skip parts of the boss fight by Mass Effect I by convincing Saren of his evil), it was truly great. I think its time that Bioware managed to cut back on meaningless fights and only allowed interesting battle situations (for example, the ascend to the final fight in Mass Effect I - it was quick, great layout and it had a story to tell: our heroes climbing the final mountain). I wouldn't want to skip them, but often it felt like ""and now kill 20 enemies, because its a shooter we play, here!"". Especially in Mass Effect 2, where sidestories all followed the same scheme.<p>Oh, about the female/male stuff: I think Mass Effect and Dragon Age are the only franchises that take relationships and gender seriously.

Or do you have a community around you who would, to an extent, entertain your whims to pursue goals other than the perennial career/home/toys/family name franchise path?<p>There's also the pursuit of crap you can't take with you, but is that necessarily a dichotomy? Maybe there's an unhealthy weight placed on the toys and widgets we geek types surround ourselves with... I like to think I have a healthy relationship with these things but I know if someone took my ZX Spectrum away I'd be pretty miffed.<p>Could be, could be... we saw people today flying into a rage because they couldn't get their hands on a cheap, underpowered Linux box.

Sure it hurts at first but like a child living in a warzone you normalize to it eventually and learn to live with it. The best part of depression is that you feel like you are seeing the world for what it really is, gone are the happy hormones that force the oppression of hope on you, gone are the dreams and fantasies that you know aren't ever going to come true. There's a beauty to it. You feel awake. Yeah dreaming is fun. And it's ok for most of the world to dream away in their fantasy world. But someone has to be awake to solve real problems. There's a reason why some of the most famous artists, poets, singers, songwriters, inventors, did their best work during their darkest days. I'm currently happy and hopeful but I honestly can't wait for my next depression cycle. That's when I come up with my best ideas.<p>Also, think about it. Would you rather a live a lie and be happy or know the truth and be miserable? There's a reason why people spend their lives on Facebook playing Farmville, and on YouTube watching kitten videos.

3647600,comment,3646631,3647517,11,0,glogla,,,"Arduino, while nice and useful (I used it more than once), it's much less than raspberrypi. Arduino's power comes from the community, nice IDE and a lot of examples that are easy to grasp even for someone who is not a CS major. It is wonderful if you want to make you off-shelf PC communicate with simple engines, many types of sensors, things like that, and it's easy to connect to Processing or puredata, it's basically what you get if you want an interactive art piece and don't want to mess with assembler, bootloaders, and whatever.<p>However, Arduino is 30 USD for ATmega, 20 I/O pins and a USB you can use to program it. Raspberrypi is 35 USD (1) for ARM as powerful as the one in iPhone, with 256 MB RAM, HDMI output, two USB ports you can use to connect peripherals, allegedly powerful graphic processors (though it's probably going to have proprietary bloby drivers) and an Ethernet ports. Oh, and some I/O pins too.<p>It's basically a general purpose computer, allegedly as powerful as Pentium III (2), as big as Arduino, and taking slightly more but still incredibly small amount of power.<p>For further comparison, BeagleBoard has slightly better connectivity but worse CPU and graphics, and is bigger, and is 150 USD (about 4x the cost). PandaBoard is faster but similar and is 170 USD (little less than five times the cost). And yesterdays Arstechnica article speaks about similar computer in shape of a small flashdisk with slightly faster CPU than raspberry and ! GB ram costing 200 USD.<p>This is like free.fr for ARM development boards. It doesn't mean Arduino is finished or something (it's best thing was always the simplicity - anything you can do with Arduino can be done with plain ATmega and some hacking and they're dime a dozen) but it's nice.<p>(1): though local prices vary. Here Arduino is listed as about 1 USD less than raspberry.<p>(2): I can't remember where I read that, and it might've been Pentium II, so don't quote me on that, plese",1330520560

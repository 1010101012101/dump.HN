Was society better from this than for example developing nuclear fusion or cancer treatments, which probably weren&#x27;t more outlandish ideas at the time than going to the moon?<p>What truly boggles the mind is that the US at the time was a country of housewives, racial segregation and prosecutions of gays and bisexuals. Yet, or perhaps because of that, they decided that the way forward was to build a moon ship. It says a lot about society at the time.",1409396103

I had a client I worked with on several projects and they paid fully up front which was fantastic. On the final project I worked with them they still owed me half the bill, deleted our basecamp project (nearly all communications), stopped replying to my emails, and ignored my invoices. It was 6 months before I tracked down their new company and surprised them with a phone call and threat of court. I eventually got the money but needless to say the guy was an asshole about it.<p>I guess my point is that even when you think you have built a good relationship with someone over a few months, when you&#x27;re working on the internet people think they can do whatever they like. The internet makes it easy to gain trust and easier to destroy it.<p>As for how to deal with the client try to work things out without threats. Only resort to threats when necessary as the second you mention court people go on the defensive.",1409396097

8246046,comment,8245362,8245362,1,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"I read all the way into the next post, &quot;What the hell is representation?&quot;.  I don&#x27;t really see why the question is all that confusing (first Red Alert for ignorance and bullshit goes here).  My first halfway-informed guess is: a representation is a three-tuple of a compression function, a resulting data-structure, and a decompression function that, taken all together, capture at least some of the causal/computational structure of the process generating the data.<p>Of course, this extreme generality is what makes representation learning Very Hard, but also very powerful when you can manage to get it working at all.<p>Compression function: because we choose to assume (without ever being able to prove, see Chaitin) that our data is <i>not</i> algorithmically random.  Conveniently, most real-world data isn&#x27;t algorithmically random, so learning about the underlying process <i>must</i> result in a description that can compress the data more efficiently than just writing down the sample-set.<p>Data structure: the actual representation, which (ideally) explains (most of) the data on its own, plus or minus some kind of noise.<p>Decompression function: learning would be useless if we couldn&#x27;t perform <i>any</i> kind of inference or prediction.  We need a way to take the internal representation, plug in some parameter values (either ones we&#x27;ve learned from data or deliberately counterfactual ones), and then make a prediction about further samples which will constitute the actual action taken to perform a useful task.<p>So it&#x27;s a question, I think, of whether we&#x27;re doing information-theoretic learning, or <i>algorithmic</i> information-theoretic learning.  Mind, this could all be bullshit, as I&#x27;m a total novice at this stuff.",1409393240

In high school, I picked up programming and before I knew it, I was programming almost all of the time. It&#x27;s great to be able to have an idea and build it instantly.<p>However, life is not just programming. When I was in my senior year of high school, I got multiple job offers from tech firms in my country to come work for them. This monday however, I&#x27;m starting a university course cs at UVA (university of Amsterdam). This is not because I love programming less than studying (the opposite, actually). It is because I&#x27;m playing a long-term game instead of a short one. In colleges, there is so much knowledge right under your nose, and you get to work with people equally smart. Starting this monday, I&#x27;ll be on the frontier of technology.<p>From there, I can learn, experiment, socialize, and everything else that I couldn&#x27;t do while I was building custom CMS systems or optimizing a SQL database for some lame company.<p>Your working life can last more than 50 years, so be wise about choosing your fundamentals.",1409393133

So the programmer’s job becomes that of, “a person should understand, by looking at a particular section of code exactly what it’s trying to do and exactly how it’s doing it”. One step beyond is that if you can do something elegant rather than a jugaadu solution.

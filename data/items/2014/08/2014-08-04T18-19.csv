8133414,comment,8133103,8133103,13,0,_archon_,,,"I found myself disagreeing with the premise that highway speed limits don&#x27;t influence people&#x27;s driving speed. I may simply be part of the 15%, but consider the following anecdata: On I-90 in upstate NY, the &quot;speed limit&quot; is 65. I&#x27;ve gone by several state troopers at 70-75 without issue or confrontation. I don&#x27;t go faster, not because traffic dictates, but I&#x27;m concerned about litigious policemen. To put it in Freakonomic terms, I&#x27;m going just slow enough that I won&#x27;t get caught. If the limit was 10 mph higher, I&#x27;d drive 10 faster, as would everyone who was on the road for more than one exit (or governed semi tractors).<p>There is very little crowding on the stretches of highway I&#x27;m most familiar with. If the speed limit was 120, I&#x27;d probably cruise around 90 or so, assuming it wasn&#x27;t rush hour. I propose that there is a diminishing impulse for travel rates as they increase, but also that on well-cleared, divided, limited-access highways, we have diminishing utility for speed limits as a regulating concept. Highway driving is the easiest driving to do. There are more variables in control than anywhere else. Why not re-evaluate the roads, not based on the 85th percentile of drivers living under the threat of litigation based on arbitrary bureaucrats, but on simple road capacity and volume?",1407178676

8133409,comment,8132275,8133143,7,0,jzimdars,,,"There is more to it than than just oil. OKC didn&#x27;t go nuts like much of the country did during the real estate boom and likewise we didn&#x27;t get our asses handed to us when the market dropped. We saw moderate gains followed by moderate loss. That&#x27;s a big reason why OKC has maintained one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country throughout this financial crisis.<p>IMO this is a reflection of a culture that&#x27;s a little more traditional and a lot more conservative than the rest of the country (and I don&#x27;t mean crazy-right-wing-extreme-conservatism, though we have that here, too). People live, work and start businesses in OKC because they want to be here — not because they want access to VC/talent/incentives/loopholes.<p>I&#x27;ve lived in OKC for 20 years and we&#x27;ve stayed because it&#x27;s a great place to live.

Creating a bunch of port-a-potties is a cheaper, and more possible, short-term solution than upgrading the water infrastructure for a country of a billion people. Yes, I said billion, because yes, that is a factor. Ignoring it won&#x27;t make it easier.<p>I&#x27;ll agree, putting a port-a-potty inside my apartment isn&#x27;t a great solution ... but now we&#x27;re arguing placement, not the validity of using it instead of an open field.<p>As for cleaning out the port-a-potties ... if the Indian government who&#x27;s installing these things isn&#x27;t allocating some funding or encouragement to cleaning and maintaining, then that&#x27;s another resource-allocation problem. Here again, we&#x27;re discussing a bad (or at least, imperfect) <i>implementation</i> of the goal, not the validity of the goal itself.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that in a sense it&#x27;s not even upgrading water infrastructure - if a large region has next to no waterworks to begin with, that makes this even more difficult.<p>Lastly, just because it doesn&#x27;t look like Western sanitation, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a better temporary solution. I would even suggest that for an area with very little water infrastructure to begin with, it may be too much to expect them to go straight to a system like you&#x27;d see in Berlin (or, I&#x27;m guessing, New Delhi).",1407177742

Should I trust them for the full $10k in my Stellar client? Some intermediate value? Why?<p>Great question. You&#x27;d probably want to Wells up to the $250,000 FDIC insurance limit — the US government has guaranteed that funds up to that amount are safe, and so you likely feel comfortable with them holding that amount on your behalf.<p>> Let&#x27;s say that I want to cash out some bitcoins using Stellar. I&#x27;d find a Stellar gateway that supports Bitcoin, deposit the bitcoins there and trust them for the deposit amount. I&#x27;d need a USD gateway to send the funds to. Do I trust the USD gateway for the expected USD value of the bitcoins plus a buffer for variance in the price?<p>This one is probably easier to handle just by using Stellar&#x27;s baked-in exchange. As I mention at the end of the post, you can make exchanges without regard to your trust settings. So the workflow would be:<p>- You deposit BTC with a gateway, trusting them to your deposit amount.\n- You create an offer with TakerGets: BTC, TakerPays: USD from your desired gateway.<p>And you don&#x27;t need to set an explicit trust line with the USD gateway.<p>> If I trust two gateways for the same currency, the network reserves the right to move balances between those gateways. Do these moves only happen if they increase my balance? Otherwise, why would I trust multiple gateways for longer than it takes for me to complete my transactions?<p>In the steady-state, the way to think of a gateway is as an analogue of a bank. You probably want to maintain a long-lived relationship with one or more of them. Those moves will happen at par.<p>For example, imagine that I had $100 with Wells Fargo and $100 with Chase, and you have the same. By default, we could wake up tomorrow and find that I have $200 with Wells and you have $200 with Chase.<p>> I&#x27;m excited to see what people build to solve that problem.<p>Me too :).",1407177197

That seems to be the problem the hotel in question claims to be facing.  &quot;What&#x27;s best?&quot; inherently presumes &quot;For what?&quot;.  A vintage hotel shouldn&#x27;t be rated on the same criteria as a five-star downtown hotel or business hotel.  Or for its healthcare, auto-repair, clothing, bookstore, or hardware characteristics.  The challenge is when an entity tries to claim a special status or twist that&#x27;s at strong odds to most general expectations.<p>Thin data.  Only a small number of people typically leave reviews, and you&#x27;re likely to get feedback only for exceptionally positive, or exceptionally negative, experiences.

When a node&#x27;s haproxy fails, how is BIRD informed of its failure? What if the failure is in some way that internal fault detectors don&#x27;t see the failure.<p>* How is the ECMP hashing problem handled?

The bio-filter harbors bacteria which neutralizes the fish urine. Yes, it will not seem &#x27;clean&#x27; but it doesn&#x27;t matter. \nAnyway, you should change out the water a bit at a time. Imagine that the water is water in a glass. If you let it evaporate halfway, and add more water, then eventually that water will get cloudy as the concentration of minerals increases. Minerals don&#x27;t evaporate, so that water gets more and more concentrated minerals. You have to remove about 10% of the water a week and replace it, to keep the water normal. You could also use distilled water, which I&#x27;ve had success in starting a new tank, but if you do clean out a tank, don&#x27;t clean the bio filter and you need to let the new water sit for about 24 hours to let the chlorine dissipate.<p>>Change in chlorine?<p>Uh, there shouldn&#x27;t be any chlorine in a fish tank. You and your roommate should probably look up fish care in google or something. The first link is to ASPCA and they do have good advice. I had an aquarium for several years, and if you don&#x27;t know what you are doing, mollies or perhaps a plecostomus is a good choice. The pleco can survive pretty nasty water. However, they can grow pretty large and they would need a huge tank. They live about 10 years or more, so it&#x27;s a big commitment.

If you want to have a huge impact, working for a company like Google or Facebook, in the right capacity, pretty much guarantees it.  Not having to worry if checks will clear, if kitchens will be stocked, etc. is a nice benefit on top of that.<p>(If I could get the job of ""make Android the most secure mobile OS, using some of the stuff from ChromeOS, and utterly crush all other mobile platforms in the Enterprise, I'd be really tempted; or the same thing for an EC2-killer from Google, also built around security.)",1326772718

You sum the owned part of the distributed vector, then use MPI_Allreduce() to get the result of the global sum (the parallel implementation uses some tree structure, usually semi-redundantly, perhaps using dedicated hardware). If you run with a different number of processes, then the reduction will necessarily be done with different associativity. Of course any such result is as good as the others (unless the vector is somehow sorted in which case some orders will commit larger rounding error).<p>The MPI standard does not require that reductions use deterministic associativity for the same number of processes (independent of the physical network topology), but they do suggest that it is desirable and (AFAIK) most implementations are deterministic on the same number of processes.",1326772036

That driving around on a publicly-funded, continuously-maintained network of asphalt doesn't constitute ""pushing consumption off onto others""?<p>One eventually realizes that minimalism of any kind is a trick of the mind. Nothing is really simple, even things that aren't alive, and nothing really exists in isolation. A thing can be minimal only relative to something else, and only along a limited axis, and only so long as you don't think too deeply.<p>(Did I just say that Trio's classic ""Da Da Da"" has only one note? Oops, I lied, I didn't look deeply enough: The chorus has a <i>background singer</i>, and though she - it sounds like a she - is designed to be a <i>minimalist</i> background singer she does sing multiple notes, adding vital depth and texture and helping to make the chorus sound so awesome: It's a joke of a chorus, but it's so much more musically rich than the verse that it sounds like heaven when it arrives.)",1326772013

Python is a pretty poor language to design large-scale systems in.

This happens right now with phones: same hardware goes for both Android and Windows Phone, no questions asked.<p>In my opinion, this whole ""logo requirements"" thing is blown out of a proportion: there's no commercial product with Windows 8 ARM, almost all Android devices are locked down, yet Microsoft gets all the heat.<p>2 - Presence of a keyboard doesn't make toy device a lesser toy with same toy rules applied.

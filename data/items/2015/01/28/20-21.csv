Probably not.<p>--<p>If you are learning iOS and doing production / client work, you should be aware that using a third party framework could actually break your app. I&#x27;m interested in React Naive, but also very weary about it.

8962485,comment,8961551,8962231,0,0,masklinn,,,"> I can understand this, but... The DOM is already incrementally rendered by the browser. That is, changes to the DOM are not direct, but are performed by the browser in a way that is as efficient as possible. So, why the need for a render() method?<p>The browser tries to batch updates as efficiently as possible, but because of the model there are limits on that, reflow and layout thrashing are easy pitfalls to fall into for instance. React&#x27;s model obviates these issues so the system can make significantly more assumptions about what is happening, and it can combine and batch more aggressively.<p>Furthermore, React&#x27;s updates can trivially be delayed as much as necessary (in browsers, usually to sync them with the next repaint using requestAnimationFrame), not so for DOM mutations.<p>> Also, the render() method itself could be quite big and thus could take a long time to run, and almost completely nullify all advantages of incrementally updating only the display.<p>It could be but it usually isn&#x27;t, and more importantly for these cases (and others) the system can be told that there&#x27;s no need to re-render the component (`shouldComponentUpdate` in react), the previous result can be reused as-is.<p>For &quot;pure&quot; components (which simply map application state to render state) it&#x27;s easy to implement, and downright trivial when using persistent datastructures: it&#x27;s just an identity check (which is why systems built from the ground up on persistent datastructures like clojurescript/om or elm.html are faster than &quot;naïve&quot; react OOTB: they can assume components are pure, will only use their parameters/state to generate UI state, and that said parameters/state hasn&#x27;t been screwed with;  React being a more general-purpose JS library can&#x27;t afford to make these assumption, it has to be opted in explicitly)",1422478367

So, sometimes some religious rules in modern Islam are rooted in hadiths, not directly the Qoran itself. There are hadiths that forbid depiction of the quick [2]. Also, some consider depiction and other forms of art to be <i>sheerk</i>[1], which means pretending or comparing oneself to God, trying to be godlike, which is sin (Hashr 24, Araph 11 can be interpreted to tell that creating and shaping are attributes of the God).<p>Thus there are various interpretations of Islam&#x27;s allowance and tolerance of depiction of the things, the quick, the people, the prophecy and its particular prophet Mohammed. Sunnis, which are Turks and majority of Arabs as far as I know, loathe and are averse to depictions to some extent. More religious older people in Turkey refrain from being depicted anyhow, while some are fine with memorial pictures of themselves and relatives. Majority of the community is though, do not oppose any sort of picturing apart from Mohammed&#x27;s, and they are taking and publishing pictures of themselves and other people and objects, animate or not, as everybody does. I have heard that Shiites are also lax regarding prophetical depictions, but I have not encountered personally the shiite culture, so, I do not really know.<p>So, it all boils down to the fact that when someone, Muslim or not, publishes visual material regarding Mohammed, and the God in an islamic context, they should be ready to face different reactions from different parts of the Islamic community. And, as we are living in the internet age, where information goes from Alaska to Iraq in the speed of light (figuratively), its no surprise that living in a non-muslim community does not matter at all in this context.<p>One would be offended when somebody tries to hurt or offend someone who he considers to be more worthy to him than himself, right? Well, the verse Ahzab 6 [1] says that Mohammed is more worthy to a Muslim than himself.<p>[1] I have tried to phonetically reproduce names of soorahs and religious terms, I do not guarantee they are correct.<p>[2] Now, I am not that familiar with hadiths and how these are really cited, but here are some citations nevertheless: Müslim 2107/96; Müslim 2107/90, 94; Buhari 5957, 5958; Müslim 2107/87, and others.",1422477722

The only catch is that they represent the 160-bit key in hex so if you&#x27;re using RFC4648 formatted Base32 (e.g. the default for Google Authenticator) you just need to convert those keys.  After that you can add them to your DB just like you add keys for Google Authenticator and they&#x27;ll work with the same verification code.",1422477226

8962359,comment,8961086,8961482,0,0,saberworks,,,"Which is one thing I absolutely hate about Netflix nowadays!  I usually &quot;discover&quot; movies to watch on &quot;instant&quot; directly on my Roku.  When I want to use their website, it&#x27;s because I saw a preview for a movie and want to add it to my (dvd) queue (since I already searched and they didn&#x27;t have it in &quot;instant&quot;).  So I type &quot;netflix.com&quot; in my browser, and wait 5-10 seconds before that screen loads and allows me to choose which profile to pick (and it doesn&#x27;t save it, so each time I come back I have to do the same thing).  Once I click a profile, it takes another 5-10 seconds to show me a list of &quot;instant&quot; movies and all the links actually become active.  Then I can type my search term in the search box (for example, &quot;Matrix&quot;) and faster than I can count, a list of movies pops up, and I notice I am forwarded to &quot;dvd.netflix.com&quot; (which, if I go to manually at the beginning, still takes >10s to load).  I&#x27;m on a 100mbit connection on a late-model macbook pro and no matter which browser I choose (firefox, chrome) it&#x27;s the same.  Is all the slowness due to the massive amount of client-side javascript that has to be loaded and then processed?  I&#x27;m not sure, but their web site has been getting slower and slower for years, not faster and definitely not more usable (don&#x27;t get me started on the fact that they don&#x27;t show the movie title in text w/out having to hover for 2 seconds -- trying to read the titles on many of the movie image thumbnails is unpleasant).<p>Streaming performance itself has always been top notch.  Hard to understand how I can start a streaming movie in less time than it takes to load a list of movies in a browser.",1422476959

Something that someone in a different discipline could use to get at least conversant in.  I&#x27;m a EE who has been interested in building more mechanical things (especially how to compute things mechanically), but some of my biggest problems are know what search terms to use when trying to look things up.  Like for instance I&#x27;ve been wanting something like a mechanical multiplier/mixer.  There would be one rotating input shaft, two rotating output shafts (call them X and Y), and a &quot;control&quot; input which would direct the input shaft motion to the output shafts in proportion to the control.  So if the control were at say the &quot;zero&quot; position, all the input motion would be transmitted to the X shaft, and Y would be motionless.  When the control was at the &quot;one&quot; position, all the motion would be transmitted to the Y shaft, and X would be stationary.  The control would be continuously variable, and it would be great if it also performed the sinusoidal conversion at the same time, essentially:<p><pre><code>    X = Input * sin(control)\n    Y = Input * cos(control)\n</code></pre>\n...I imagine something like this must exist, and deriving it from first principles probably isn&#x27;t exceedingly difficult, but knowing what it is called is another matter.<p>Getting back to the topic at hand, I suppose the book I&#x27;m dreaming of would cover things like gears/pulleys and their common/interesting combinations (like a differential), springs, thermodynamics, hydraulics, linkages, heat engines, etc..  And as long as I&#x27;m dreaming if there are also similar texts for chemistry and cellular biology/DNA/genetic engineering, I&#x27;d also purchase those.",1422476775

For instance if you have a component that needs to know its render height you want a hook for calculating that height AFTER the entire DOM has updated.  Otherwise you are going to force multiple layouts (bad).  React provides these life cycle methods.<p>As far as the render method being big, the premise React is built on is that the virtual DOM is much faster than the real DOM. Test as necessary for your own comfort / use cases. I personally trust the testimonials of people smarter than me that aren&#x27;t the React team also feel this is true and are making real changes to their products based on that.

Standardizing these things is actually what gives you a platform for your beautiful and unique coding style to emerge for everyone to admire and coo over. If everyone is always arguing over tabs vs spaces and which charset to use, no one will notice how your beautifully styled guard statements have changed their entire outlook on writing code.",1447073988

That fragments of actual memories of places been and instructions given might be a little stronger than a torture subject&#x27;s capacity to invent alternatives, or even recall why they were so keen not to give that information in the first place. Useless to establish guilt or complex plans, but quite possibly better than nothing for a few elusive details, assuming that &quot;nothing&quot; is what more acceptable interrogation techniques have yielded.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s even easier for the subject to simply agree with the torturer <i>if the torturer actually has a narrative they want agreed to</i>, but in those case actually obtaining information was obviously never the reason for the torture in the first place...",1447073938

In that vein, I think it makes more sense to look at culture as the lossy compression we use to store value judgements of our experience -- accepting that we can only store a fraction of the &quot;raw&quot; data.<p>The best way to combat the natural narrow-mindedness that <i>any</i> culture forces on you, is to travel -- and if possible live for a long time (6-12 months) submerged in a different culture. The best time to do this, is probably before you fully become an adult -- living with a host-family as the &quot;child&quot; of a foreign culture allows/requires a degree of acceptance that is very valuable if the goal is to widen the idea of culture. Having two cultures that are sometimes contrasting, but also accepted as &quot;real&quot; allows one to introspect -- and realize that one really have to question <i>everything</i> -- there are very few universal truths.<p>For those that are, or have, teenagers in the house, and have the means -- I strongly advice to look into international volunteer inter-cultural programs, like:<p><a href=""https://www.afs.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.afs.org</a><p><a href=""https://www.yfu.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.yfu.org</a>",1447073917

It&#x27;s just not economical for Blizzard to do an OSX port.<p>The game has been kinda dead for a while now, because it&#x27;s so unaccessible to the general population. Games like Dota and League of Legends have taken the place of Starcraft 2 because it&#x27;s pretty accessible to newbies yet offers a very high skill ceiling for those who want to play competitively. Starcraft 2 is simply too difficult of a game - you have to micromanage not only whole armies but also create new buildings and new units, looking for ways to boost your economy, and micromanaging research, all at the same time. It&#x27;s simply too much to ask for a new player looking to break into the game.<p>Dota existed because players just wanted to play a single hero inside an RTS game, and not have to control an army. The army is automated, there is no research, and there is no building/economy to worry about. You simply control one unit. Then League came and made it even more accessible to new players. Starcraft just simply cannot compete with both of these games, it just takes too much effort to even be remotely good at the game.",1447073863

Theoretically I could change the channels tonight between full metal alchemist reruns and ESPN, although not being interested in sports, I won&#x27;t.  But I could, and if I was really bored maybe I&#x27;d magically transmute into a rabid rugby fan.  In an era where credit cards have to be whipped out and customer service argued with to change the channel-app, its likely I&#x27;ll subscribe to an anime streaming service and never even have the ability to see ESPN.<p>And the follow on to that, is as a long term survival strategy, &quot;TV apps&quot; will almost need to let people stream one show per week for free with no subscription, otherwise due to normal churn you&#x27;ll get 5% of your subs leaving annually and 0% new subs.  At least currently, middlemen publishers need a smooth on ramp to survive.<p>And the follow on to the follow on, is people who only watch one show on XYZ network will likely watch for free, and the &quot;TV app&quot; ecosystem will likely smell a lot like the existing premium channel marketplace.<p>And the follow on to the follow on to the ..., is existing premium channels need to watch out... if the history channel gave up hitler, truckers, pawn shops, fishermen, and all the other stereotypical reality TV shows and actually did history for a change, HBO better look out if they think they can do everything with a headliner of a medieval g0repr0n series, surely a dedicated premium history app-channel could blow them out of the water, in fact trying to do everything will get them blown out of the water for everything, and given the lack of subscriber interest overlap, they&#x27;re likely utterly doomed.",1447073838

Of course, this is where everything goes through the door, because the <i>easiest</i> way to increase CTR/conversions is by adopting shady techniques like almost-nude-model or underwear pictures, pop-ups (@#$&%$#!), modals, etc..<p>I can see multiple reasons why advertising like that is doomed to fail.

There <i>are</i> however certain undertakings to reduce human suffering: bans of certain particularly inhumane or indiscriminating weapons, prohibitions of deliberate targeting of civilians, and yes, elimination of torture.<p>If you make an effort to reduce suffering it comes as a complete package: people quick to torture are the same people who would use Sarin on civilians. There is simply no middle ground. The concept of <i>innocence</i> doesn&#x27;t come into play anyway. Wars are mass murders stemming from greater social and political processes; a conscript soldier guarding a fuel depot is not any more &quot;guilty&quot; apriori than his civilian relative.<p>There is more or less intellectual consensus that wars cause suffering, and attempts are made to reduce the misery. Propagating torture is not serving a good cause here. You essentially argue that a &quot;lesser&quot; crime is acceptable in context of a &quot;greater&quot; crime going on anyway.

10532553,comment,10528689,10528689,0,0,scrollaway,,,"I&#x27;m a backer with extensive game development experience, maybe I can offer some insight as to the game&#x27;s state.<p>1. Feature creep<p>Most features were announced in the kickstarter. Things such as &quot;hollywood voice actors&quot; or &quot;motion capture&quot; were all part of the initial stretch goals. This is CIG delivering on the promises they made, there&#x27;s been a bit of feature creep here and there certainly but not as much as people claim. I&#x27;m certain not all of it will make it to the release, FWIW, such is life in game development.<p>2. Finances<p>The game is extremely ambitious but it most definitely has the money for it. Its total budget is looking on-par with GTA5 which had a much, much more expensive marketing campaign and added costs. SC has the advantage of being crowdfunded and having an existing userbase, making it somewhat-riskless for anyone who would want to invest into it. CR has a lot of money of his own as well.<p>3. FUD<p>The studio has been repeatedly attacked by various parties that stand to gain if the game fails. One of those parties comes from a personal vendetta against Chris Roberts. If you enjoy drama, I highly recommend reading into it, it&#x27;s fascinating (and quite depressing as well, you&#x27;ve been warned...). Quite a few mediocre news websites just want to jump on the Star Citizen hate-train because it&#x27;s an easy shot and drives clicks, I find that appalling. Reading starts here [1].<p>4. State of development<p>The game is just about where you&#x27;d expect it to be. It&#x27;s lacking content but they&#x27;re pushing out the tech pretty hard. Parts of it are already playable, dogfighting/racing is a lot of fun. I don&#x27;t play it myself. Most of the tech is out or about to be released; I estimate that, from the point where they&#x27;ll start adding the actual content, maybe a year to release. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll meet their deadline (autumn 2016 iirc?) but they&#x27;ve surprised me before.<p>5. Development process<p>CIG has been <i>the</i> most transparent game studio in the world. The blog [2] is regularly updated with tech, finance, design insights, in-game news etc. This sort of transparency and insight into the difficulties of running a game studio is why I&#x27;m rooting for them so hard. It&#x27;s a model I want other studios to adopt. I highly recommend reading that blog even if you&#x27;re not into the game, skip to the technical articles, they&#x27;re great.<p>[1]. <a href=""https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/14979-Chairmans-Response-To-The-Escapist"" rel=""nofollow"">https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/14...</a><p>[2]. <a href=""https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link"" rel=""nofollow"">https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link</a><p>PS: Someone else said in the thread, &quot;even if it&#x27;s a great game, many will be disappointed&quot;. Quite right. I&#x27;m very concerned by that; I think SC&#x27;s greatest flaw is that it makes everybody think the world is being promised to them, and a lot of people are not realistic about the results. I personally think that even if they deliver on 20% of their promises, it&#x27;ll be a kickass game, so I&#x27;m excited either way... but a lot of people won&#x27;t feel that way.<p>I don&#x27;t think the game will &quot;kill&quot; crowdfunding. From an investment point of view, it&#x27;ll be regarded as a success no matter what happens. Maybe it&#x27;ll kill high-budget crowdfunding but, remember, the game initially, on KS, asked for about 1% of what it has today. The crowdfunding discussion is a fascinating one to have, but SC is an outlier in every single category so I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s fair to judge on that.",1447070742

I always read about these 2 explanations. Both quite entertaining, and a little to much Hollywood-like to be completely true.<p>Management by objective is the true problem here.<p>Step 1: Management, moved by market, shareholder and/or own ambition, sets unrealistic goals - probably even unknown to it.<p>Step 2: Employee, perhaps several levels of goal setting below, realises it can&#x27;t be done, and cheats to save his career.<p>I suspect this kind of systemic evil is involved in a lot of corporate misbehaviour.

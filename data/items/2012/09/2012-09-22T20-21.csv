This way users will start entering the 16 characters of the password that is hashed (hopefully) and stored, then users won't enter their longer truncated password when longer passwords are allowed.<p>However, this transitional step could be skipped with a truncated password flag that is set for all old passwords, and cleared for new passwords.

She's lived in the UK for the last 10+ years.<p>I know a Romanian who got Swedish citizenship because it was easier to stay in Sweden that way. He didn't want to be forced to move back to Romania. He's then got US citizenship a few years later.

4558875,comment,4556838,4556838,40,0,grellas,,,"A few thoughts:<p>1. This is a superb essay delineating the attributes of a fast-growth, all-or-nothing type of startup. No surprise here. Who besides pg has had the depth and breadth of <i>quality</i> first-hand experience with such ventures over such a sustained period and in such an explosive context as that of recent years? He has here given us a classic analysis of the prototypical, Google-style startup.<p>2. I think the idea of a startup should not be so narrowly defined, however, and the big reason is this: many founders set out to build ventures that are tech-based, innovative, aimed at winning key niches via hoped-for rapid growth and scaling, positioned for outside funding as suited to their needs, and aimed at liquidity via capital gains as the primary ROI for their efforts . . . <i>but</i> who also place a huge premium on minimizing dilution and maximizing founder control. These are the independents. The ones who, by design, want to defer or even avoid VC funding so as to build their ventures on their own timing and on their own terms. Now this is not the Google startup model. It is, in a sense, its opposite. But it is not the model of a small business either. It is just a different type of startup.<p>3. The trend over this past decade has moved decidedly toward greater founder independence in the startup world. Back in the bubble days, as a founder, you had very little information available to learn how startups worked, you often had heavy capital needs (e.g., $2M to $4M) right up front to do such things as build your own server banks, and you would almost certainly have little leverage by which to minimize dilution or loss of control at the time of first funding. Today, this has completely flipped. Vast resources are extant teaching founders how startups work. Initial capital needs are often minimal. And it is relatively easy to get reasonable funding on founder-friendly terms. What this means is that, today more than ever, the independent-style startup is more open to founders than ever before.<p>4. Given the above, it seems to me that this is not the time to say that the <i>only</i> style of startup worthy of the name is that of the super-rapid-growth type. The rapid-growth type may be more glamorous by far but it really defines only the tip of the startup world. Beneath it is a vast world offering incredible opportunities to founders who want more control over the timing, scale, and management of their ventures and who seek to realize gains and manage risks accordingly.",1348345057

There's a possibility that this is a gambit from Google, either to cripple iOS in favor of Android or to simply extort higher fees for Google Maps.<p>I think the software user experience of iOS Maps is actually better than Google Maps, from the visual design of the maps to the 3D flyover mode to the turn-by-turn directions. The problem is the data. We've seen Apple underestimate how hard some problem are before--MobileMe was Apple underestimating how hard cloud stuff is, Ping was Apple underestimating social. I think Apple just underestimated the problem of map data.<p>The good news is, the data problem actually can be solved with cash. Design and software problems can't.",1348344339

With a second Market maker, the exchnage gain is I believe orders of magnitude lower.  Almost any Market maker is forced to maintain sensible spreads (else it is worth trading without them) so just one Market maker will offer expensive but not outrageous spreads.

4558830,comment,4549504,4557001,3,0,NateLawson,,,"My main complaint was your implication that large numbers of JS developers (""many"") would benefit from this low-level crypto API in the browser. I think it will have the opposite effect, leading to a million differently-broken encrypted message protocols, encouraged by the browser offering just enough rope to shoot the users in the foot.<p>You don't really address this issue, but point to what you claim is the greater good: more freedom to implement any protocol the dev pleases. In your opinion, the gain from this is worth the cost of a few million compromised users (story out yesterday: Pandora doesn't manage keys for encrypting cookies properly due to a developer choice).<p>The only problem with this argument is that there is <i>no limit</i> on browser JS developers' freedom today. They can implement anything they want, plugging in AES ECB blocks wherever they want.<p>For example, consider Meebo, which sent a JS RSA implementation plus the key itself as a substitute for SSL. There was nothing wrong with their JS implementation of raw RSA (as far as I remember), but the whole problem was that crypto doesn't work if the key and cipher implementation are both modifiable by an attacker.<p>I find it funny that you agree with me in the end:<p><pre><code>  You can't escape from the fact that crypto is hard, and 
  that there is always going to be a segment of developers 
  who will simply not get it right.
</code></pre>
The goal is not to prevent every failure, but <i>reduce the number of devs who will fail</i>. The way to do this is to offer high-level APIs that reduce the number of such victims.<p>Currently, the W3 API will victimize millions of users via any clever developer who has read Applied Cryptography. With a high-level API, you reduce that set of devs to those who are determined to get it wrong (e.g., post private keys on their website today). I think you agree that's a smaller set (though how much, I don't know).<p>The W3 low-level API will encourage more flaws while offering no improvement over the current JS security model. The fact that you can do things like Meebo (but with higher performance and cred with managers that ""it's the standard""), is a net loss of security, not gain. Too bad.",1348344057
4558829,comment,4556838,4556838,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"One of the things we don't see often, and I wonder about are situations where the Angel funds 40% of the company at a seed round at one valuation, and then contributes half their interest in exchange for cash in the series A.<p>From a practical standpoint this means that the company needs to raise n + A where the ""+ A"" part pays back a return to the angel. But it allows the Angels to shoulder risk early to weed out the non-viable players and still make money at it.<p>So imagine this scenario. Alice wants to start Woohoo and Bob funds 40% at a $250K valuation (since Alice is the only person so far, that is $100K invested. Alice works hard and gets out an MVP and goes for a Series A where she wants to raise $1.5M at a post raise valuation of $5M. Bob sells into the round half his shares (its taking money off the table for him) with a contractual net return of xx% (probably anywhere from 20 - 100, that being the negotiating rub) and does not participate in future rounds, he retains y% at the end of the series A (optionally converted to Common stock) and dilutes going forward. (remember he's got 'free' stock at this point, he's made his bit with the angel round)<p>The two negotiation points on Bobs term sheet are the net return and the retained interest portion. The people coming in after Bob are Ok with it because Bob is out now and paid his 'finders fee' or however ever you want to describe his return. The net return will affect the series A amount needed by the founder, the retained interest would be a function of how many rounds the founders think they will need to exit.<p>Given the seed to series A or bust cycle is usually at most 24months, Bob has a good idea of his risk profile, and by stepping out from an equity point at the Series A he's not an obstruction to new partners coming in, more of an adviser at that point.",1348344030

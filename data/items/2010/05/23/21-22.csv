All this will happen again""  -- Pythia, BSG.<p>The first thing I do is research the daylights out of every competitive product I can find and compile a super set of features of all of them, noting pricing, positioning, messaging, etc.<p>Then I circle the features that matter to me and I add my own secret sauce features.  Then I turn the computer off and start sketching.<p>Sketching isn't the act of coding or even designing.  It's the act of thinking.  Look at Leonardo's sketches -- particularly the ones of the human body.  <a href=""http://www.drawingsofleonardo.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drawingsofleonardo.org</a>   He isn't documenting in so much as he's working out what he thinks about how something will work, not just on the outside but on the inside as well.  This is particularly true for his anatomy sketches.  IMHO he would have been an awesome software designer.<p>I believe that coding is the art of thinking clearly.  Lack of clarity in what you're building almost always results in bad code, the kind that no amount of tweeking can fix.<p>IMHO the absolute best prototyping tool out there is graph paper and pencil.  Personally I like the marbled notebooks because they can take a beating and you can write on them reclining.<p>Once you've got all the screens of your site drawn out and even some copy written in the margins then you can turn the computer back on and revisit each of those competitive sites and see if your idea still hunts.  If it still does then start coding.",1274651734

It's a bizarre mongrel of functional, dataflow, OO and declarative (as per Prolog), and revisits Alan Kay's idea that OO is about the messages, not the objects.  On steroids.<p>It uses the left to right version, so function application is (args).(func) although that's not the syntax.  In particular, using Lisp-like notation, addition is written similarly to (3 4 +) where 3 is sent to the tail of the list.  the tail of the list is 4 sent to +, which creates a function that adds 4 to its argument.  Thus (4 +) is a function in its own right.<p>There are interesting parallels with continuations and the like, but we've found some problems with the underlying theoretical basis and are re-working some of the ideas.<p>Of course it's probably isomorphic to an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp, but there you go.",1274651662

What problem am I really trying to solve? <i>The point is to think about the users.</i> I draw boxes that walk through the user sessions I want to support. For example, ""user wants to do X lands on the site, they find the link that says Do X, they click on it, which shows them a screen with UI elements 1, 2, and 3...."". They're called storyboards, and you don't need to be very detailed.<p>2. Knowing what I want to serve to the user, I think about the data that needs to be stored, how I'm going to obtain it, how to store it (database choice + schema), and other backend plumbing bits. This step is critical as I'm a firm believer that your database schema is a competitive advantage of a business. Get it right and you'll be able to serve your users better. However, it's important to realize that you won't get it right first time, and even if you do, it will need to evolve with your app. This is why I love schema-less databases.<p>3. With all this sorted, I tie up with a web framework I've written. It handles the routing, has data validation/sanitization helpers, handles user authentication, and all the other functions a web app needs. I just copy/paste these standard files into the new project's folder and I'm well on my way into the project because I can start focusing on the business logic.<p>Yes I plan on open sourcing this framework when I get a chance.

Schools are less well funded now than they have been for decades, especially where I am in California where the public school system has been on a consistent tragic slide since Reagan was governor, from once being among the best in the nation.<p>Blaming <i>teachers</i> (or blaming “scary teacher unions”) for that is a tremendous distortion; teaching is only a reasonable profession because of a long history of hard fighting for decent wages. Most of the teachers work their asses off, for all of our children, and heaping scorn on them is one of the most reprehensible of the talking points of the right in America over the last 30 years.<p>(disclaimer: my mother is a teacher)",1274648555

3839348,comment,3838274,3839266,1,0,ilaksh,,,"Good point.  I hadn't thought of it that way actually but that has got to be part of it.<p>For me, I sort of skipped over Ruby.  I was too busy with other things to really get into it.  So since I had more experience (not a lot, but more) with Python than with Ruby, that is what CoffeeScript seems like to me, instead of Ruby.<p>I always liked Python syntax, its just that I was busy with projects that involved a lot of HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP etc.<p>I have spent years and years writing C#/C/C++/JavaScript/PHP code with curly braces etc.  To me, the curly braces and some other stuff are noise.  Especially when you get into callbacks and have to remember to keep all of your curly braces and parenthesis straight.  Its basically stuff that, as demonstrated by CoffeeScript, the compiler can take care of for you, but in JavaScript it just wasn't taken care of.<p>In a similar vein, JavaScript (and any other dynamic language or language with static type inference) demonstrates that type declarations aren't necessary, and that a language/compiler can usually take care of that stuff for you.<p>In a similar vein, C demonstrated (among other things) that managing the stack manually isn't necessary.<p>Ruby syntax to me is significantly more complicated than CoffeeScript and not really as clean (begin end blocks etc).  I think that Rails has some important advantages in terms of software engineering, but the performance and syntax of Ruby turns me off a bit.  Still, there is probably more good than bad so I might still end up doing some Rails stuff.<p>I don't think its advantageous to write an if statement backwards and I think people who wear black wire-rim glasses when they can easily afford contacts or don't even need lenses are ridiculous.  I also have never owned a Mac in my life.  I dual boot to Ubuntu/Windows 7.",1334361496

3839334,comment,3838379,3838379,2,0,Lazare,,,"PHP is a bad language; it is ubiquitous due to historical accidents and path dependencies.  If you have the freedom to pick any language you want, and you don't have some specific urge to write Wordpress plugins or something, then <i>DO NOT PICK THIS</i>.  (Also, PHP is likely as popular as it will ever be.  There's not really any room for further growth.)<p>Perl is similar to PHP.  It's not nearly as bad - in fact it's a great language in many ways - but it's also old.  It's about as widely adopted as it's ever going to be, and it doesn't pick up new features as quickly as it once did.  The syntax is also a bit quirky.  :)  Unless you want to work on Perl codebases, I'd recommend staying away, not because it's <i>bad</i> but because it's not really good enough.<p>Haskell isn't really suitable for scripts or simple webapps (your listed use cases).  It's a wonderful language, and knowing it will make you a better programmer and a better person...but it doesn't do what you want.  Stay away.  :)<p>Better choices for you would be:<p>Python/Ruby:  Flip a coin and pick one.  Both are awesome, but they also have a lot of overlap; you won't regret either choice.  They're both excellent for writing short scripts, webapps, etc.  They are objectively MUCH better languages for these purposes than PHP, and at least marginally better than Perl.  They also have very serious market share (which makes it easy to find tutorials, help, example code, open source projects to contribute to, etc.)<p>Javascript:  With the advent of Node, it's a decent choice for what you want.  And it's still the omnipresent language for client-side programming.  Not as mainstream as Python/Ruby, but still pretty popular and widely adopted - but it's not completely mature, and new and interesting ideas are still popping up.<p>Something else:  If those options don't spark any interest - or if you already know them - you might look farther afield.  Lua and Clojure are both interesting options, in very different ways.  As someone who already knows Python and JS pretty well, Clojure would probably be top of my list of ""languages to learn"".

The shorter competitions are focused on finding the low-hanging fruit that generate large improvements (such as SVD & RBM's in Netflix's case) and exploring the space of possible model structures, as opposed to optimally ensembling across a large number of models to eek out the last 0.01% of performance.<p>Exploring the space of useful features & possible models enables you to trade off computational efficiency & maintainability vs. model performance in production as well.

The ability for a web developer to disable the zooming feature!</i><p>Implementing a complete specification isn't ""going out of your way"", it's very much in your way. It's also not saying you endorse every feature therein. (From a quick search, this appears to be a part of CSS specifications: <a href=""http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-device-adapt/#the-lsquouser-zoomrsquo-property"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-device-adapt/#the-lsquouser-zoom...</a> ). Creating features from scratch is going out of your way. And creating features which allow you to zoom in on any site feels like a strong endoresement that zooming in is generally useful.<p><i>Take a look at Twitter's Bootstrap. It has a variety of different responsive design levels, not just one at 320px. Great example of how a design can fit many different devices.</i><p>More sites aren't designed well than sites which are designed well. I'd rather put my moment by momnent usability of something ahead of the designer's musing about what ""should be more usable"" any day. And the abuse of such a thing is to disable zoom for the designer's sense of aesthetics over the user's sense of usability, and I suggest that happens much more than the designer using it to increase usability. And that's a trade-off I dislike having to deal with.",1334360997

The use if mmap and relying on the OS to page in/out the appropriate portions is painful, particularly because we end up with a lot of moves (padding factor varies between 1.8 and 1.9 and because of our dataset, using a large field on insert and clearing in update was less performant than upserts and moves).<p>There's really two knobs to turn on Mongo, RAM and disk speed.  Our particular cluster doesn't have enough RAM for the dataset to fit in memory, but could double its performance (or more) if each key range was mmapped individually rather than the entire datastore the shard is responsible for just because of how the OS manages pages.

A business they have no expertise in, that is nothing like any business they have expertise in, and that is only barely tangentially related to products they make?<p>More so, payments is all wrong for apple. Payments is about boring stuff like consistency, robustness, and low overhead. That's not what Apple is about. Apple is about melding good quality software with compelling aesthetics and design. Because software construction is very difficult to merge well with aesthetics and design they have a key advantage over many of their competitors. And they use that advantage to make products that people are hugely enthusiastic about and willing to pay high prices to purchase, providing high profit margins to Apple. This is precisely the opposite of what's needed for payments. Apple would need to dumb a huge amount of money to develop a payments system, and it would need to grow a very anti-Apple sort of team within Apple to be able to be competitive. The chances that they'd screw it up and lose their investment are high. The chances that they'd ruin their brand and cause a diminution of their core business is also high (imagine if people thought about the Apple brand the way people think about Paypal, or Bank of America).<p>In short, this idea makes no more sense than saying that Apple should run a nationwide chain of taco trucks.",1334360110

It is great for writing big applications because they will be very efficient, and have a sound code base that is easily understandable and extensible.

Java uses a concurrent mark and sweep GC.<p>Part of the problem is that the default GC is not the ConcMarkSweep collector in most installations but rather its the parallel ""stop the world"" GC that is optimized for throughput, not latency.  For web applications (or anything with latency issues) step one is almost always to modify your JVM opts to enable the CMS collector.<p>Unfortunately even the ConcMarkSweep collector can have issues.  Its not that hard to create a workload that it can't handle resulting in your app slowing eating through all available heap space because the collector can't keep up ultimately forcing a full collection which on large heaps can be devastating, think 60 to 120 second pauses.<p>The G1 collector, which is no longer considered experimental in Java 7 is 'better' and you can specify a maximum pause time, but it can still run into situations where it has to force a full GC and there are situations where the CMS collector is still better.",1334358166

His assertion that X% of $Y billion market is pure profit assumes that 100% of the X% of mobile are iOS purchases. Even still X% must be further drilled down to Apple's actual cut. So, assuming Apple could take 1% of the $600B restaurant market and facilitate $6B in transactions, their cut assuming his crazy 10% transaction fee would be only $600M. Common jCal sensationalism.<p>I'm the furthest thing from an Apple analyst, but it seems that all ""built-in"" Apple things like iCloud, the App Store, etc. are not simply cheap entries into a market to make money. Each deeply complements and satisfies a fundamental need with a piece of Apple hardware. A payment application of this nature doesn't seem to sit quite at the ""essential"" level of Apple's other apps/services.",1334358146

The child tends to engage the mother more for his/her needs.  So women tend to have less flexibility since the child demands more from them.

You and your partner just have to help each other, and don't be afraid to say to them ""I just need a couple of hours away from the baby"". Obviously you have to do the same for them.<p>- After three months generally any collicky issues settle down, and they start smiling and really recognizing you. Now it gets good!<p>- Routine (in my opinion) is everything. We used a modified Gina Ford routine and he was sleeping 7pm - 8am every night by 5/6 months. I'm tired in the evenings but only in the usual way - no more exhaustion.<p>- It's unbelievable how much you care for them. When you hear their pain cry (the staccato one; not just the usual crying) you drop everything and run to them.<p>- The biggest change/loss at this stage is the loss of intimacy (and I don't necessarily mean in bed) with my wife. Little things like ""shall we go out for dinner on a whim"" or ""here's breakfast in bed"" are very difficult to achieve.<p>- Spare time is almost non-existant for me, apart for a few evenings when wife and baby visit grandparents. My admiration for people with both startups and babies (and especially side-projects and babies) is enormous.<p>Can't tell you about the later years (not there yet), but I'm looking forward to just being part of a family with a little mini-me to re-experience the world with.",1288178810

1838088,comment,1837843,1837843,0,0,RyanMcGreal,,,"There's a two- or three-week period, usually around the six month mark, when your baby can sit up unaided but can't yet crawl. During this time, you can put the baby down on an activity blanket (supervised, obviously) and enjoy maybe five or ten minute contiguous stretches of uninterrupted time to do stuff.<p>Note: activities like <i>preparing a meal</i> and <i>straightening up the place</i> tend to take priority over <i>developing a startup</i>.<p>A few suggestions to help make things easier for you:<p>* ""Attachment parenting"" early on pays off hugely in more independent, more emotionally secure children later. Invest in a Trekker [1], Snugli [2] or other baby harness that lets you carry the baby facing inwards or outwards and frees up your arms to do other stuff.<p>* Seriously consider having the baby sleep in your bed with you, especially if you/your spouse are breastfeeding.<p>* Seriously consider breastfeeding. Once established (usually takes a few weeks to get really comfortable with it), it's so much healthier, easier and more convenient than bottle feeding that I can't understand why anyone who has the option wouldn't take it. (Disclosure: I'm male, but my spouse agrees 100%.)<p>* Accept and embrace the fact that from now on, all your plans are contingent. Learn to build big buffers around all your scheduled activities. Get in the habit of keeping a utility bag with you at all times.<p>* Don't waste your money on a change table. You will change that baby's diaper wherever you need to do it. (We've changed our baby's diaper in the trunk of our car.)<p>* Don't forget that you and your spouse had reasons to be together before the baby was born. As soon as the baby is old enough, get back into the habit of going on dates and otherwise spending time together. Don't miss opportunities to let your spouse know how much you cherish them. A little act of kindness at a crucial moment can radically transform your family dynamics for the better.<p>I'm sure I'll think of more, but that seems to be a good place to start. As always in anything to do with children, YMMV.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.babytrekker.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.babytrekker.com/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.evenflo.com/category.aspx?id=23"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.evenflo.com/category.aspx?id=23</a>",1288178393

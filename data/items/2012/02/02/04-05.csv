They make money hand over fist but refuse to provide even a modicum of service. I purchased Jamestown, the space shooter, and the download did not work correctly. It took more than a week of repeated harassment before Steam support would respond to any question. In between replies was at least 2 days every time, sometimes more. The frustrating part is that they had the solution right there. It was something a call center could have worked out in 45 seconds.

3541403,comment,3540158,3540572,7,0,ramanujan,,,"Hmmm. I think the obvious transition would be to ship the Facebook Phone and heavily incorporate Facebook Credits.<p>The four things people do on phones (call, email, text, and nowadays photo-share) are all inherently social things. Crucially, your iPhone contacts list likely has only the first/last name and phone number for each person, whereas the Facebook app is far richer in its implementation of the very same contacts list -- because the person on the other side has gone to the trouble of keeping their address, phone, picture, and the like all fresh and up to date[1].<p>So the FB Phone would be an enormous improvement in contacts management over what we currently have, and an FB Phone Directory would probably not be long in following[2].<p>Once people are using the FB Phone, you'd want to heavily push FB Credits as the payment solution for everything. I am sure that from a fraud protection standpoint, the identity signals that an FB account provides are highly desirable to Visa and Mastercard. FB could also just cut out the middleman and do payments directly with an FB Card, instantly accepted by 800+ million people worldwide and countless businesses. Sign up for FB.com and accept/receive payments. Use the social graph for authentication, where each node has an authenticity rank (based on its date of first signup, number of non-commercial posts, number of authentic friends, and the like). It's easy to set up a fake email address, but much harder to fake a realistic profile for years and get ""real people"" to friend you and interact with you.<p>Thus, a Facebook purchase or clone of something like WePay or Square would seem like a logical move. Embrace the shift towards mobile and own mobile payments by owning identity. Owning identity means a lower risk profile and higher profit margin than any competitor in payments.<p>[1] Not incidentally, the use of the FB Phone would ensure that people have even more of an incentive to keep their contact information up to date and searchable.<p>[2] This directory would be a huge product in its own right and the core of a real social search product, something more along the lines of findpeopleonplus.com than anything that's called itself ""social search"" to this point. The purpose of social search is to find a person, not a web page.",1328156450

There's a reason why the Department of Law-interpretation-and-enforcement is called ""Department of Justice"" instead. Lawyers love to think that they're administering justice and not simply a piece of legislation. But we should not fall for this linguistic trick and equivocate justice with what is legal.<p>Political philosophers often use the word ""justice"" or ""fairness"" to refer to some moral ideal that is above existing laws, and which we can appeal to in evaluating existing and proposed laws. There are disagreements about the content of this ideal, of course, but none of that makes the concept of justice less authoritative than positive law. On this definition, the first quote would stand, but the second quote wouldn't make much sense.<p>There's also a sizable literature on civil disobedience, whereby citizens are morally permitted -- or even required -- to disregard laws that they believe are grossly unfair or unjust (provided that certain other conditions are met).

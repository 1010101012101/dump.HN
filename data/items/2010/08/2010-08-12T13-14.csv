But I always thought that the type of professional CEO chosen by yahoo and google essentially told the story of the future of the two companies.  Eric Schmidt has a PhD in CS (according to wikipedia, he wrote his dissertation on solving problems in distributed computing).  Terry Semel has a BS in accounting and worked in the entertainment industry for two decades (warner bros).<p>I don't know much more about the two men, but I'm 100% certain that Schmidt did a colossal amount of programming in his day, and I really doubt that Semel ever did, though I can't be sure of this.  This <i>has</i> to have a serious effect on the hacker culture.  If nothing else, Google's choice sends a message to programmers that technical ability matters all the way to the top.

You pay the additional half being self-employed, but it's also a deductible expense.<p>The biggest adjustment people need to make is keeping track of the financial aspect in general.  It's not that hard, but you need to keep an eye on it.  Make estimated tax payments quarterly, don't spend more than you make, keep extra money in reserve, etc.<p>Also, as I wrote elsewhere, I'm paying $300/month for health insurance for my wife and I.  That's close to what was being deducted for my group plan when I was employed (it's a bit more, but not that much more).  Yes, we're fortunate as we're both in decent health, but we've also chosen a moderately high deductible plan, which keeps the premiums lower (though they still keep going up insanely every year).<p>I've not done it yet, but as a self-employed person, you can set up a SEP-IRA (I think that's it) and some people manage to sock away much more in a SEP than is allowed in traditional Roths or 401Ks.  If you've got it and can save it, that's decent deal.<p>I will say $90k as self-employed vs $45k employed <i>is</i> a pretty big difference, even factoring in the tax/benefits diffs.  But I don't normally see that much of a difference in skill levels and income.  SR devs I know contracting may be making $120-$150k, but as an employee might only be around $90-$100k.

They'd outlawed that functionality, so they removed the app when they tried to sneak it back in. This is perfectly logical.<p><i>However</i>, if users want the functionality enough to bother going to secret URL to enable it, perhaps the rule is a bad one. Users clearly want something as simple as using a physical button to take a picture, but Apple won't let them because it violates their guidelines. On one hand, this means apps are consistent and follow Apple rules, but on the other hand, it means you simply cannot have a ridiculously simple feature simply because Apple says so. Would you rather have consistency or freedom?",1281619901

1598000,comment,1597144,1597144,0,0,JunkDNA,,,"There's lots of great advice here. I've got a 10-week old girl who I'm certain is the cutest, most wonderful little thing in the world. I'm assuming you're the dad (if you're the mom, I can't offer much).<p>Stuff to think about <i>right now</i>:<p>-Sleep deprivation starts <i>early</i>. Your wife is going to be uncomfortable as anything the last several months. She may toss and turn a lot at night. Plan accordingly.<p>-If there is <i>anything</i> you've been wanting to get done, do it <i>now</i>. I had been putting off copying my old Amiga hard drive to preserve my childhood computer for 10 years. I narrowly got that done before the baby arrived.<p>-Make some meals you can easily freeze so you don't have to cook if you don't want to. You'll need this in the first few days as well as much later when you and/or mom go back to work. Cooking is a royal pain with a really little baby.<p>Stuff to think about after the baby arrives:<p>-Plan on not getting any sleep and being entirely unproductive while awake (you <i>are</i> taking several weeks off work right?) the first few months.<p>-Expect that while awake, you will have <i>zero</i> time to yourself. Use the time you do have wisely, frittering it away on Facebook is probably a bad idea.<p>-Expect the first night home to be unreal. My wife is a pediatrician and I thought that would prepare us. Boy was I wrong. We were still two bumbling clueless parents. Best thing we learned that night is division of labor: one sleeps while the other is awake with the baby. Otherwise, you are both going to be completely exhausted instead of a manageable ""really tired"".<p>-A smartphone is a huge help with a little one. I read HN at night a lot when my daughter is drifting off to sleep in my arms but not fully asleep. I do it primarily to keep myself from falling asleep while holding her. It's easy to hold in one hand (vs. a laptop or iPad).<p>-Babies love white noise. They find it incredibly soothing. Get a white noise generator of some kind. We have a 99-cent iPhone app on our phones that we use daily. My daughter loves ""air conditioner"" mode. She often fights sleep and squirms around a lot. White noise and a pacifier put her into a deep, restful slumber.<p>-Babies get cranky for a variety of reasons you will never know. Your inner geek is going to want to find reasons for things and understand ""the system"". Resist this, it's futile 50% of the time. Instead, try random things: change the diaper, change position, walk around, sit them upright, lay them down, etc... It's good to have a bunch of stuff to run through. Sometimes, a screaming baby just needs his or her mom though, don't forget that.<p>-Babies like to be with you. Get a bouncer chair so you don't have to hold them all the time and they can watch you as you steal 5 minutes to post photos online. Get one with a vibration mode. They find it soothing and can nap for quite a while there.<p>-Plan on doing lots of laundry. Babies mess up their clothes and yours all the time. Make sure you have a basin or utility sink where you can soak clothing with detergent to get poop out of it before washing in the machine. We discovered Oxi Free (doesn't have any perfumes as opposed to regular Oxi) takes poop out really well and doesn't damage colors.<p>-Take tons of photos, they change a <i>lot</i> very quickly.<p>-Efficiency is key. Look for places to reduce labor. Are you always carrying pacifiers around the house? Leave one in each room. Spending lots of time washing bottles? Get a dishwasher rack that holds them. No time to clean your house? Get a cleaning person to come in and give it a once-over. Just as with a startup, sometimes it's better to trade money for time.<p>-Mom needs you more than you realize. Help her out. The biggest thing you can do is to suck it up, tell her to get some sleep and take the baby for a while. Yeah, you're exhausted, but babies need moms who aren't basket-cases. You'll survive.<p>-Talk to your pediatrician about any concerns you have, no matter how silly. They hear the same things <i>a lot</i>. A good one will give you excellent advice, even about things that aren't strictly ""medical"".<p>Best of luck to you. It's a life-changing experience and one of the happiest times in your entire life.",1281619627

You can take care baby, but it would be nice if someone can care for you in the meantime.<p>* If you have not yet, read about sleep depreviation. Motivate your wife to rest as much as she can during pregnancy and following birth.<p>* About the routine, it seemed not so important to me when I was pregnant, we were not the routine type of couple. It turned out to be very important. When you set a routine, baby knows what's next, so she relaxes and be much more cooperative. And when you know what's next, you can plan your day (no, not boring, believe me).<p>* Take your family outdoors frequently. It will help your wife to recover.<p>* You'd better spend some time evaluating baby products to be familiar with market.

Even if we say it's a cult of Steve Jobs, I don't think it's a far cry to say Jobs is a consumer product hacker and a bit of a market hacker.<p>Two essential qualities of good hackers is an abundant ability to synthesize elegant solutions from disparate details, and a desire to create great things.  Jobs may not write code but he clearly has these two qualities.  So even if Apple does not have an engineer-centric culture, a design culture driven by Jobs can be directly compatible.  You see the differences of course, in the products Google and Apple make, but I think the point is that great hackers can work at Apple because they can get behind Jobs vision.<p>Contrast this with a ""suit-driven"" company where decisions are made by looking at statistics and market research, and executives strategize about how to maximize sales based on the superficial product understanding they have.  Even worse, places where you actually have people in power who couldn't give a crap about the product as long as they have a $500k+ salary rolling in every year.",1281618910

Investors were excited about the Internet. One reason they were excited was Yahoo's revenue growth. So they invested in new Internet startups. The startups then used the money to buy ads on Yahoo to get traffic. Which caused yet more revenue growth for Yahoo, and further convinced investors the Internet was worth investing in.

""Mob rule"" is a proxy for the entire notion that direct democracy cannot work; the only other responses are that people don't want it or people can't do it. It's a blatantly obvious response from anyone who did not already buy into whatever mikeash is selling. The fact that he was framing his next response to be a sophisticated, high-fallutin, knock-your-socks-off thesis of epic proportions was disgusting and offensive. I'm not surprised that a taste of his own medicine cornered him into name-calling and running away.<p>> Your reply to ktizo was much more informative and appreciable.<p>Because ktizo was asking for information. If someone asks a question, I answer it earnestly. If someone is clearly ignorant, I try to explain what they're missing. If someone claims to have a solution to a well-known problem like ""ZOMG!SHEEPLE"", I expect them to actually have the damn solution ready at hand and not dangle it like a fucking carrot.<p>He could have called me on my tone and then answered the question.

I think being the 'practical' Lisp is a good place to be.<p>That said, there are a few issues that are going to make some CLers irrationally intransigent.<p>The JVM is a biggie. They hate it, they don't want it, and they definitely don't want to be <i>constantly</i> skimming across the surface built on a foundation of Java libraries.<p>The <i>dream</i> was the Lisp machine, tur---Lisp all the way down.<p>Clojure is the refutation and negation of that dream. It is, to some CLers, an insult and a defeat.<p>You will never win those people.<p>Those even willing to pay the price of having to learn two programming languages at the same time (Clojure and Java) for the sake of getting a more modern and hip Lisp are still going to have a few sticking points.<p>1. Inability to produce binaries<p>2. You don't win anything in terms of individual productivity, nominally. The language is a side-grade.<p>This goes double if they're eccentric and like implementing predicate-dispatch libraries instead of mobile-social-local web app mash ups.<p>3. Clojure, semantically speaking, while cleaning up a lot of Lisp warts actually removes and hinders a lot of patterns that CLers relied on via mutation. The last thing a Common Lisper wants is the elimination of the <i>option</i> to do something.<p>Common Lispers, culturally, have more in common with Haskell than Clojure.<p>Their Haskell just hasn't been made yet.<p>Clojure is a cultural mismatch for many Common Lispers, especially the obsessive navel-gazers who to their credit, are the vanguard that advances the standards and research into the languages they use.<p>There are definitely those types of people in the Clojure community (amalloy wrote a decent article on anaphoric macros in Clojure), but the depth isn't there.<p>By going from Common Lisp to Clojure, you only <i>lose</i> things irrational as that may seem to normal people.<p>I mean, you even give up tail-call optimization. Yes yes, I know, (loop ... recur) and trampoline, I know. But it's not me you have to convince.<p>I'd rather keep the company of somewhat more sane people such as that use Clojure. That doesn't hold a lot of value for a lot of CLers I know though. They don't give a damn and never have.",1350384220

You won't get anywhere near Fortran or C++. Try as you might. Even relatively sundry CV work is unpleasant outside of the prototype phase on anything but C++/et al.<p>I'm sorry you felt attacked, but the scope of experience is relevant to the subject. I realize it's very difficult to discuss one's limitations, or have them pointed out by others, without internalizing it and making it a subject of ego.<p>I generally stick to the high level tier of languages until I am <i>forced</i> to drop down a layer. Experience and pain have stripped me of all hubris that could lead me to believe humans could overcome the fundamental semantic and informational constraints involved in optimizing code that needs to concern itself with the machine-behavior from a higher abstraction layer. I've done more JVM and GC fiddling than I care to recall.<p>There's a glass ceiling, you won't escape it. Even Paul Graham, the master Common Lisper himself, took advantage of the relatively easy to use FFI faculties in Lisp to drop down to C to optimize hotspots. This was a common pattern when he was doing ViaWeb, I'm told.<p>It doesn't have to be that way. I am genuinely sorry if you felt attacked or that I was uncivil. I will find other ways to express myself if I run into another similar situation here. That was a failing on my part, please forgive me.<p>I'm not wont to pontificate to plumbers as to how they should go about plumbing. I say that as someone who's actually redone the plumbing in a residence from top to bottom with my bare hands before.

In essence, taking a profit out of google's adwords/adsense program while google kept fine tuning its pricing algorithm.<p>The term may sound fancy, but this business model has been questionable from the get go. I've read a few studies, and this type of practice artificially inflated prices on certain keywords, the process would start by these companies buying a few ads on the main google page(via adwords), if a user clicked on the them, they were sent to a landing page with more ads of the type(via adsense), in the hope's they would make up the difference clicking on more ads....that's were the 'arbitrage' came in, Google didn't have the pricing model right: to the tune of $100 million a year, its certainly isn't illegal, these companies just figured out what keywords were being paid more on the content side and cost them less to advertise themselves.<p>As an added note, this type of practice or 'search arbitrage' tends to beget more shady practices, since the revenue margin is so tight ( and its been getting tighter ) practices domain tasting and domain kiting, I wrote a more thorough piece on this whole subject: <a href=""http://www.webforefront.com/archives/2008/01/advertising_con.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webforefront.com/archives/2008/01/advertising_con...</a>

227670,comment,227368,227368,0,0,dusklight,,,"Okay I really like the message that is being sent in this article.<p>But whether it works really depends on the company culture. You gotta remember that for each individual employee, his/her incentive is NOT to do what benefits the company the most. His/her incentive is to do what benefits HIMSELF/HERSELF the most. So it is up to the company to create a culture where doing what benefits the company the most also benefits the individual the most.<p>For many many companies this is not the case. Due to internal politics or the ego of managers, it is often to the benefit of the individual employee to shut up and do the stupid thing. GIGO you know. Why should I speak up and make the company $100 million dollars, if it means my manager will get mad at me and my raise goes down by 1%?",1214412330

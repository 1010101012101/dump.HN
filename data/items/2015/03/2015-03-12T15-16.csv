So in all likelihood, money from the wealthy is being diverted into the coffers of another elite.<p>Another way to look at it is that by utilizing another stream of income, these countries, unable to tap into existing wealth, natural resources or exploitation/colonization, can reduce corruption and improve the standard of living for their citizens faster than they would otherwise.",1426175995

9191569,comment,9189177,9191349,0,0,knowaveragejoe,,,"No, I am simply approaching this from a balanced point of view. The situation is far more nuanced than the &quot;good guys&quot; are really the &quot;bad guys&quot;, and that it&#x27;s all about the money. That&#x27;s the plot of a movie, not real life. There are many people at all levels and on all sides who have altruistic intent, just as I&#x27;m sure there are those who really are perpetuating further conflict for the money.<p>I am in no way questioning the existence or influence of the MIC, but to say that across-the-board this is all about blood money is just as narrow minded as blindly defending the US as if what they&#x27;re doing is morally right. You&#x27;ll notice that nowhere in my posts do I go about doing such a thing, by the way. Far from it. I could understand you might have preconceived notions about my position though, it&#x27;s hard to see the nuance in people&#x27;s opinions when we reduce things to simply &quot;for&quot; or &quot;against&quot;. I subscribe to a Sagan-esque view of mankind as I&#x27;m sure many do here. But, again, that has to be tempered by reality or we reach solutions only useful in retrospect like &quot;don&#x27;t invade in the first place&quot;.<p>Anyways, I was originally responding to the commentary that the military had &quot;learned nothing from Vietnam&quot; while &quot;everyone else&quot; did, which is patently false.",1426175963

At first glance (based on the pages cached), it seems like we&#x27;re just following the links within your site, like we would with other websites. In general, there are a few things one could do in a case like this (I might have more from the team later; these are in no particular order):<p>- Use rel=nofollow on links you don&#x27;t need to have followed (this prevents passing of PageRank, which generally means we&#x27;re less likely to crawl them)<p>- Use 503 for rate-limiting crawlers. 503 means we&#x27;ll just retry later.<p>- Use the crawl rate limit in Webmaster Tools (I see you submitted the report there, so that should be active soon)<p>- If the content is fully auto-generated, you might choose to use a &quot;noindex,nofollow&quot; robots meta tag on these pages to prevent them from being indexed separately.

There would be nothing wrong with presenting a more hands-on linear algebra course as a first course for freshmen.  (Calling it &quot;matrix arithmetic&quot; does not do the notion service.)

You could deepen it as you wished by introducing more abstract concepts and by doing proofs, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessary.  I learned a lot from Golub and van Loan, for instance.<p>Second, the notion that calculus has had more impact on history/society than linear algebra is very hard to defend.

It&#x27;s an assembled grouping of public domain chords set in a public domain tempo. The point of the musical metronome of 12 bar blues is for the melody line to be added. That&#x27;s what differentiates &quot;Stormy Monday&quot; from &quot;Cold Shot&quot; from &quot;Steel Mill&quot; from &quot;Who Do You Love.&quot;<p>By comparison, using a melody on top of a chord progression is what is called a &quot;musical composition.&quot; In the case of the Smith/Petty situation, there was a noteworthy musical composition overlap. Do I think it was very strong? Not especially, but was it there? Yeah, it was.<p>That&#x27;s what makes the Blurred Lines case so easy for me to understand - it wasn&#x27;t about the song taking a &quot;feel&quot; or &quot;sound&quot; - which it most certainly did - it was about the song taking the structural components in the form of progression and melody and trying to lift them under the guise of doing something new. That&#x27;s not legally protected, and I think the jury got it right.<p>I totally see how music can thrive - now, if I come up with a cool new pop song, some sticky fingered producer can&#x27;t simply come along and song-jack me. I can be inspired by Jimi Hendrix, just like Stevie Ray Vaughan. I can be inspired by Dimebag Darrell, but there&#x27;s no way that I&#x27;d go out and try to re-work &quot;Floods&quot; or &quot;Cowboys From Hell&quot; and pass it off as my own work.

He&#x27;s had such success with earlier books that it must be hard for him to find a target for each new book.  In my opinion this book was his first awful book.<p>Instead of finding data and following it through to reach a conclusion he starts with a trendy conclusion, HFT is bad, and then really contorts and reaches with his data  to try and make his case.   He was also hit by the issue of HFT starting to wind down around 2010 and really starting to wind down around 2012.  Many HFT firms no longer concentrate on the US Equity markets alone, they do alot more volume in the futures, options and bond markets where there are alot more mathematical correlations, and hence more opportunities for mispricings to correct.<p>If you want a sound rebuttal, and in my opinion a better book have a look at this book:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8577237"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8577237</a><p>I find it more balanced, better researched and it provides a much better understanding of the HFT industry.<p>Having said that, credit where credit is due, he&#x27;s a tremendous writer and the book is a fun read that you can consume in 2 days.  If you like it then I recommend his entire back catalog, they are all fun and informative reads.<p><i></i>EDIT<i></i> someone asked for an example of why I didn&#x27;t like the book so....<p>One of Lewis&#x27; biggest issues was what he termed HFT front running.  This alone was a pain as front running already had a well understood meaning( it originally was meant for a intermediary who took your order and executed its own order ahead of yours, often buying the stock lower and selling it to you at a slightly higher price).<p>His example was that a HFT system would see an order for say Microsoft trade on the exchange BATS, say a buy of 1000 shares. The HFT system would then run ahead to all the other exchanges and buy up the remaining shares on those other exchanges, an ammount that might be 1000 shares or it might be 100,000 shares, so when the remaining part of the order to buy Microsoft got to those exchanges it would have to buy the shares from eh faster HFT system at a higher price.<p>This is down right silly for a few reasons.<p>1) it assumes that the order that got filled at BATS was either a market order or a limit order that was priced for more than the fill price, because if it was a limit for the same price as the fill then buying up the remaining shares won&#x27;t do the HFT firm any good:)<p>2) it assumes that the order was for more shares than what got filled on BATS, so now the HFT firm is exposing itself by owning shares it&#x27;s not even sure anyone wants to buy at the price its willing to sell.<p>3) it assumes that the HFT system can both buy the remaining shares at the original price and get to the top of sell side of the order book to sell those shares back.  The HFt firm now has to take the risk that it won&#x27;t be at the top of the order book and even if it was right about steps one and two, a big if, it might not be able to capitalize on it as it can&#x27;t jump ahead of anyone who had previous sell limit orders at the price it now wants to sell at.<p>There are just so many unknown factors there that there is almost no way this type of trading system could be profitable.<p>Remember HFT firms worship at the alter of the law of large numbers, they make fractions of a penny per share traded but only do it if they have an edge ie 90%  upside to 10% downside.  There just isn&#x27;t any edge to be had in the above scenario, its just a heaping pile of risk.",1426175120

Nothing in this part prohibits reasonable efforts by a provider of broadband Internet access service to address copyright infringement or other unlawful activity.<p>305. <i>Some commenters contend that this rule promotes the widespread use of intrusive packet inspection technologies by broadband providers to filter objectionable content and that such monitoring poses a threat to customers’ privacy rights.784
Certainly, many broadband providers have the technical tools to conduct deep packet inspection of unencrypted traffic on their networks,785 and consumer privacy is a paramount concern in the Internet age. Nevertheless, we believe that broadband monitoring concerns are adequately addressed by the rules we adopt today, so we decline to alter this provision.</i> This rule is limited to protecting “reasonable efforts . . . to address copyright infringement or other unlawful activity.”786<p><i>We retain the discretion to evaluate the reasonableness of broadband providers’ practices under this rule on a case-by-case basis. Consumers also have many tools at their disposal to protect their privacy against deep packet inspection—including SSL encryption, virtual private networks, and routing methods like TOR.</i>787
Further, the complaint processes we adopt today add to these technical methods and advance consumer interests in this area.788&quot;",1426174893

While this may ensure that their drivers make a comparable amount to Uber drivers, its at precisely the times that Uber is surge-pricing at 1.7x+ that people are most-likely to look at alternate options. Indeed I&#x27;ve witnessed many instances of friends doing just that- checking Lyft and realizing that the cost is actually higher than Uber&#x27;s and just using Uber or (gasp) an honest-to-God cab. If Lyft truly wants to land-grab from Uber, that is the most opportune time to do so.<p>A secondary problem is that Lyft has far too few drivers (at least in DC) to realistically compete, which probably further compounds the aforementioned problem of constant surge-pricing. IMO to compete with Uber they should use this money to get more drivers on the road in major markets and do away with surge-pricing for some time until they have reached a higher market saturation.",1426174458

There was no threat to the US. This has everything to do with the Military Industrial Complex, and its iron grip on American foreign policy.<p>The MIC requires war because that&#x27;s how they sell their products. I would have expected that on a site like HN, this would be obvious. President Eisenhower prophetically warned [1] against the MIC, as he clearly saw how a positive feedback loop would form between private military contractors and US foreign policy, inciting conflict after conflict in order to keep customer demand high for their products.<p>Although you have obviously been thoroughly steeped in the propaganda offered by these two organizations, who could never acknowledge the truth of their actions, to any rational observer there can be no other justification. The US as a whole has everything to lose, and nothing to gain, by slaughtering defenseless civilians in an impoverished developing country.<p>Big defense contractors and the politicians they bribe, however, have everything to gain.

Indeed, when Pintrest first started I&#x27;m sure the logic entailed little more than that. Now, billions of page views and dozens of engineering hires later, a once-simple app becomes a behemoth force, crunching data on the order of petabytes per day.<p>How do the operations powering an app like Pintrest evolve from simple to so complex? Do the complexities emerge from necessity, or simply from idle time on behalf of the engineers, who naturally crave hard problems to solve?<p>It&#x27;s a fascinating meta-commentary on our industry that simple web apps grow to become such complex operations. A business can survive on the kernel of its core competency -- in this case, photo grids -- but to thrive, it requires careful attention to petabytes of peripheral decisions. Indeed, it seems such an evolutionary process is advantageous for a web startup. Friendster and MySpace may well have failed because they mistook their problems for simple ones. They were able to solve the core problem of a social network, but not the many peripheral ones of operating that network at scale.

9191297,comment,9189553,9189553,0,0,graycat,,,"> Too Much Calculus<p>Not for me!  Heck, I never took freshman
calculus or <i>pre-calculus</i> and, instead
read a book and started on sophomore 
calculus then continued with, right,
ordinary differential equations, advanced
calculus for applications, and advanced
calculus, topology, modern analysis, 
measure theory, functional analysis, 
exterior algebra, etc.  Not enough calculus
for me!<p>Strang, of course, is emphasizing linear
algebra.  Great!  It&#x27;s terrific stuff.
I had an abstract algebra course that 
started on vector spaces and matrix theory.
Then I got famous book from Princeton on
multi-variable calculus and read the
first chapters on linear algebra,
e.g., learned Gram-Schmidt.  Then
I got a linear algebra book and read a 
few chapters and applied them to some 
problems in classical mechanics.  Then 
I wrote my math honors paper in group
representation theory, right, more linear
algebra.  The out of school, I wanted to
know linear algebra better and read a 
good book cover to cover, carefully. 
Then I got Halmos, <i>Finite Dimensional
Vector Spaces</i> and read it cover to cover.
Wrote Halmos about his proof of the Hamelton-Cayley
theorem and got back a nice answwer!<p>Then I got another famous text on multi-variable
calculus and read it cover to cover, 
including the parts on exterior algebra.
Then I did that again from Spivak&#x27;s
<i>Calculus on Manifolds</i> -- right, a lot of
both calculus and linear algebra.  Then
I got Forsythe and Moler, <i>Computer 
Solution of Linear Algebraic Systems</i>,
read it cover to cover, directed a project
in interval arithmetic for linear algebra,
took a course in numerical analysis with
a lot of linear algebra for solution of
partial differential equations, e.g.,
iterative solutions (Gauss-Seidel) and
wrote corresponding code.<p>I also used linear algebra in work with
the fast Fourier transform, multi-variate
statistics, and more.<p>For more on linear algebra, I read
the first part, linear algebra, of
von Neumann, <i>Quantum Mechanics</i>.<p>From a world class guy in linear algebra,
I took an <i>advanced</i> course in linear
algebra -- by then the course was beneath
me and I led the class by a wide margin.
Favorite theorem -- the polar decomposition.<p>Read Coddington&#x27;s book on differential
equations -- gorgeous book.<p>The combination of linear algebra and
calculus, with other math, continued.<p>At one time
a little calculus did a lot: 
The initial value problem for
the little first order, linear
ordinary differential equation<p>y&#x27;(t) = k y(t) ( b - y(t) )<p>saved FedEx, that is, kept it from
going out of business.  So, <i>useful
calculus</i>!<p>So, sure, I like linear algebra
and like the combination!<p>I definitely do not see that I
had too much calculus!<p>Here&#x27;s what I saw, and still fume
about:  All I could get in chemistry
was one too simple course in high school
and one too simple course in college.
All I could get in physics was one
too simple course.  I college, by the
time I got to Maxwell&#x27;s equations, I 
didn&#x27;t know enough calculus to do really
well.  In college I never got math enough
to do well with quantum mechanics.<p>But in grades 9-12 and then in the first 
two years of college, I was force fed 
like a goose with six years of English
literature, with each year yet another
play by Shakespeare.  I agree that there
was a good writer in England in the
1600s -- Newton!  So it was also Chaucer,
Milton, Wordsworth, ..., Dickens, <i>the 
great natural order</i> (all corresponding
theorems and proofs omitted!), etc.  With
good information about people?  Nope.<p>Then there was history:  It never got to the
20th century.  It never touched on technology,
economics, or any other <i>causes</i>.  There
was plenty of time in history courses; it&#x27;s
just that the courses didn&#x27;t have much
content.<p>If my startup works, then I&#x27;ll get back to
more in calculus, functional analysis,
stochastic processes, and mathematical
physics.  &quot;More calculus, Ma!&quot;.",1426173621

9191291,comment,9186838,9189945,0,0,roel_v,,,"Well I guess the crux is the difference between what one considers &#x27;major differences&#x27;. It&#x27;s true that a 25k and a 75k car will bring one or multiple persons from point A to point B. A $500 clunker will do that, too. 25k will get you (sticking to new cars for the sake of the discussion, but the same dynamics hold for used) a Camaro, a Dodge Grand Caravan or a Ford Escape. 75k gets you a BMW X5 or a Porche Cayenne Hybrid. The room in those cars, the level of comfort, the quality of the drive is of a different level than in the first 3. Is it &#x27;worth&#x27; it? Of course that depends on your frame of reference. For somebody with a commute of an hour, or somebody who regularly goes out to ski or on longer road trips to visit family, it&#x27;s a real difference.<p>Back when I was a student, or even when I just had my first job, I looked at cars in that price range and thought that people would have to be nuts to spend that much on a car. Now that I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s with a family, the BMW X3 I drive doesn&#x27;t seem like such an extravagance it once did. If I had 2 million I too would semi-retire, but the X5 or Cayenne would be out of my price range - the yield on 2 million doesn&#x27;t make it fiscally responsive to buy a car of that price range. But somebody who retires with 10 million could. And they could dine in much nicer restaurants much more often (for those into that), and do a bunch of other things that would be a real difference from those with 2 million.<p>Which brings me to the second point - what&#x27;s the difference between having 1 million or 10? Well quite a lot. 1 million will let you &#x27;retire&#x27; if you&#x27;re content with a lower-middle class lifestyle and do some paid work you enjoy every now and then. 10 million lets you retire comfortably and lets you go on holidays abroad a few weeks or months a year. It still &#x27;only&#x27; (yes yes, first world problems) affords you a house in a nice but not upper class neighborhood, and you won&#x27;t be jetsetting first class around the world with it. Is that &#x27;necessary&#x27;? Of course not, billions of people would literally give their right leg for just a fraction of these amounts. Yet most people in my (Western European, mid career professionals) social circles don&#x27;t consider it &#x27;wealthy&#x27; or would be content with such a lifestyle for the rest of their lives, without any prospect of advancement.<p>Maybe there is a similar case for the difference between 10 and 100 mil, or 100 and a billion, I don&#x27;t know - I don&#x27;t have that much money, most likely never will, and I don&#x27;t hang around with anyone like that either. But I can imagine that the people with the 50 feet boats in the marina (the 100 million crowd) have a different lifestyle from those with boats that can go from Miami to Monaco (the 1 billion crowd).",1426173542

9191257,comment,9190551,9190918,0,0,dpark,,,"The problem (at least one of the biggest problems) with singletons is exactly that the singleton state is explicit.  Making a singleton explicit means making it global, which allows random code all over the place to take direct dependencies on it.  This increases coupling, and also makes it hell when you realize you were wrong and you need two instances of the singleton.<p>To your example of the connection pool, there is absolutely no reason that this has to be a singleton.  You could have N connection pools, each with their own pool of connections, just as you could have N thread pools, or N memory heaps.  This is not only possible but sometimes preferable, if different subcomponents need resource isolation (so that some connection-hungry component can&#x27;t starve a component that needs reasonable responsiveness for the interface, for example).<p>Further, most of your code shouldn&#x27;t even care about the connection pool.  That&#x27;s a level of coupling you generally do not need.  Most code should care only about an actual connection, which could be passed in.  Taking a direct dependency on the connection pool when not necessary increases pointless coupling and makes changes more expensive.",1426173232

Well, not exactly<p>We tried to manually using it, like APIs, Scripts, etc… it’s impossible, it was very had<p>So we tried cloudberry to help us upload, it will upload but also It won’t work for huge data, with glacier you won’t be able to search, list, find any file you want to download easily, also its not practical to manage all the backup and millions of files manually, also we got millions of photos we needed a way to find them easily like thumbs
So Glacier had so many restrictions like 3-5 hours restore time, 5% restore quota hard to use even with utilizes like cloudberry, cant list, search, it’s not useable as its!

The entire idea behind the government owning the infrastructure and not the services that run on them is to stimulate fair competition between private enterprises.  I wouldn't really want the government to do more than provide a usable signal to my jack.  <p>Since I'm not a USian, I don't know what to make of your arguments about congress and the like, but it worked out fine here in the past.<p>I live in Alberta and up until a few years ago the telecom was owned and operated by the provincial government.  It dropped copper to every house.  I don't see why fiber would be any different.  Some provinces still run their own telecoms.",1187510006

Now if hackernews.yc had a search function I'd look for it and not bother but as it is I have to go to google, then search something like <i><a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fycombinator.com+Meet+the+Next+Billionaires"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fycombinat...</a> </i> Maybe I should add this submission check to my sub-que software before I submit. It would scale much easier if this or similiar searches could be provided at submission.   But even then there is no guarantee that this will work, so I don't bother.",1187509430

But if another user up-voted the same item just before you, then your vote change nothing.<p>I seems that reddit solved this problem by not showing the number of points for new messages.<p>There could be a ""new"" status, marked in a special way, which explain why you vote it not showing. After enough users voted, and using the editor vote to change the weight of other votes, move the item to voted status, and show its point count.\n",1187508984

I find it hard to imagine people paying 100+ a month for a VPS when you can get a dedicated machine for less than that.<p>Watch out for VPSes by the way. They generally don't allow swap spaces, which can completely prevent the use of certain systems. If you're using LAMP, you're okay, of course.<p>",1187508970

44044,comment,44000,44035,0,0,rms,,,"Good ideas, but I still think that having no real free education will end up destroying the lives of a large number of poor kids. <p>An unwed mother has a six year old boy that is only a burden to her.  She doesn't care about her son's future so she's not going to spend her hard earned money on sending him to school. He goes to the free schools for the two years it takes to learn how to read.<p>What happens next? The mother isn't going to take out a loan to pay for her son's education. Does this eight year old have to decide if he wants to take out loans to keep going to school? I don't think many economically oppressed eight year olds would make the right decision.",1187508004

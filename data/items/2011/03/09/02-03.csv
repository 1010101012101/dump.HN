CS and JS can interact with eachother seamlessly, so as mentioned in the OP article there's no need to switch over to CS for everything and/or all at once.<p>Another important thing is that where possible CS tries to map relatively directly to JS, so for experienced JS developers they will recognize CS as a series of shortcuts which map to idioms they use constantly.<p>If you are familiar with JS, doing a few small projects in CS should get you pretty familiar with it.<p>CS is obviously somewhat immature, but I think it's reached the point where it can be considered for ""serious work"". I've found the tooling is pretty decent: coffee is slick with commands like --watch to recompile on changes, and coffee-mode for emacs is nice. There's also CS mode for vim, textmate, gedit, + more.<p>Honestly the main hurdle is potential debugging problems, but I haven't found that to be too difficult either.

2303567,comment,2302715,2302876,0,0,johngunderman,,,"> That's why Ray-casting would never pick up for real-time games (Unreal most definitely is not doing any ray-casting, I'm just giving it as a an extreme example).<p>I'm not convinced that you are correct here. Although ray-tracing has not been a good option in the past due to processor limitations, we're reaching the point at which it may become feasible. Because ray-tracing scales linearly with the number of cores you use, modern CPUs are fairly well equipped to work with it, albeit at sub-optimal framerates. See the following (from 2007) for reference: <a href=""http://www.q4rt.de/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.q4rt.de/</a><p>Outside of this, consider that the only way vector graphics are allowed to perform at their current level is due to the existence of discrete graphics cards which are optimized for the necessary matrix calculations. If we were to develop discrete cards for ray-tracing, we could potentially see amazing results. For example, in 2009 IBM developed a computer that could run full-scene ray-tracing at 1080p averaging 90 FPS. While I do not know how complex said scene was, I'm optimistic about the future of ray-tracing.",1299638732

On multicore PCs, graphics horsepower is almost completely separate from CPU horsepower available for AI. Modern games rarely escape the 15..40% CPU utilization envelope on my machine (i7 920); there is bags and bags of concurrent room. Memory usage is barely noticeable (very rarely more than 2GB as most games are 32-bit, meanwhile I have another 10GB twiddling its thumbs). Meanwhile, it's the GPU that is normally limiting framerate, but only because I'm pushing up anti-aliasing, anisotropic filtering and shadow quality.<p>I think consoles are the bigger issue: games are no longer designed to take advantage of modern PC hardware. Instead, they're developed with consoles in mind, with graphics parameters that can be turned up on the PC. But gameplay and AI doesn't get nearly the same tunable love as graphics - and in some ways it shouldn't as it would change the nature of the game - but it remains that modern PC hardware, outside of straight-line single-threaded performance and the GPU, is not particularly taxed by modern games.",1299638099

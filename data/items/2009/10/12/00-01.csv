If Soros goes through with this, he is going to loose a ton of money.<p>On a cost-per-BTU basis, taking into account upfront CAPEX, cost-of-capital, present-value discounted cash flow analysis (PV10, for example), storage, processing, transport, and end-use thermodynamics, there are no known energy sources in 2009 that are cost-competitive with hydrocarbons.<p>Which probably explains why such insanely large amounts of cash are flowing to K-Street for Waxman Markey.<p>The only applications where using something other than hydrocarbons makes business sense, is in applications where the cost of energy is not important.<p>For instance, telecommunications satellites. Or, closer to home, energizer batteries at the grocery store. A single D-cell lead-acid battery has an energy cost of $500,000 per kilowatt-hour. However, no one thinks of it in those terms -- cost-of-energy is not an important factor for this niche.<p>Thinking of ""renewable energy"" sources as a replacement for hydrocarbons is a huge mistake. Hydrocarbons are used in large-scale applications where cost is the only metric that matters. And on that metric, it is impossible to compete with hydrocarbons.<p>The best bet for ""clean tech"" is to target niche applications that are underserved by hydrocarbons. Clearly, you're not going to use an internal combusion engine to power your laptop. Rather, you're going to shell out hundreds of dollars for a lithium ion battery -- and then charge that battery from the grid, which is likely to be powered by coal or natural-gas power plants.<p>To take a page from the  enterprise software world, the problem with ""clean tech"" and ""green tech"" startups is that they are trying to make a ""value"" sale in a cost-driven market. That never works.<p>Unless, of course, you can get the federal government to tax the low-cost producers to death.",1255309127

Second, the Gary Plan is inherently very wasteful. Under the current system when kids fall behind (or if they're gifted) then you need to do 'pullouts'. This is enormously expensive. On the other hand, if you were to do something akin to open systems instruction then a kid would stay in the same 'class' only until they finished the unit, and then move on to a new teacher for the next unit. This means you wouldn't have to do pullouts, because the kids who were having trouble would just spend more time in that section. Then each school just has one or two people who monitor the pupil's time per unit compared to their expected time to complete that unit, which is based on their past performance in the subject compared to the standard performance on that unit. The other benefit of this is that now you have accountability for each student throughout the system as a whole, whereas currently troubled students are just shuffled from class to class without anyone caring enough to fix the problem.",1255308162

The purpose of colleges was to bring you into a certain culture and tradition: the culture of educated people.  The purpose of vocational schools was practical job training, nothing more.<p>Attending ""college"" was more prestigious, but also of little interest to most people. (Most people are basically practical.)  Social initiatives to bring poorer people into the educated world put money into colleges, not vocational schools.  But most people don't want to learn about Keats and the Magna Carta and that sort of thing, they just want to get skills to do a job to make more money than they could without those skills.<p>Over time, the purpose of colleges became confused.  People today see colleges as intended to provide job training, and just doing a lousy job of it.  Colleges, with their state funding, grabbed much of the market from vocational schools, killing off most of them.<p>So today, we have many colleges, with vast numbers of students.  Most of the students mostly jump through useless bureaucratic hoops for four or five years, don't learn the things educated people know, and don't get job skills, either.",1255306886

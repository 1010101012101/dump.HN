Zipcar, as a corporate entity, is not responsible for their member's actions unless they caused the actions or (in the ever-popular) ""should have known"" the actions would take place.<p>In the linked article [1] from the Reuters blog, the court ruled that Zipcar is a car rental company.  All car rental companies are not responsible for the actions of the people who pay to rent the cars.  The insurer that provides coverage that people buy through Zipcar is responsible for fulfilling the terms of the policy, but that is a contract between the insurer and the insured.  Zipcar bears no corporate liability, which is where the person whose car was rear-ended erred.  If she had sued the driver and Liberty Mutual, or just the driver, she would have prevailed if the driver had been found at fault and could have recovered from the driver's insurance company.

They don't require you to have outside insurance, and they don't even offer you an opportunity to (through them) get more (specifically liability) insurance at an additional cost. I don't know about you, but when I see the word ""comprehensive"", I tend to think it covers everything.<p>The concept of the car sharing service is that it's something you use rarely. Paying to be insured 24/7/365 for something that you use once or twice a month seems wasteful.  I'm not even sure it's possible to get insurance for car sharing services through traditional insurers. In any case, it seems like far more of a hassle than checking a checkbox to pay more to get some additional insurance through zipcar directly.",1276668245

But the browser modal dialog box blocks <i>all interaction</i> in <i>every tab open in that browser window</i>, which is beyond obnoxious.  It's easy enough to pop up one of those lightbox style popups <i>within the webpage</i> instead of blocking the whole damn browser.",1276668236

The answer should be 'when I need a document-based data store'. You determine what type of database you need (RDBMS, KV, Doc, Graph, Column-based etc.) based on the type of data you are storing and retrieving. You don't want to use mongo for an accounting database etc. That said, mongo is the most mature, stable and feature rich of the open source doc based db's.",1276668206

Was in the US for about 7 years, did both my degrees there and OPT both times. Was about to let a company I had a good relationship with apply for my H1-B, but decided to move home.<p>Now that I am back home, I can't explain to you the weight that has been lifted from my shoulders - to be a citizen again. It's not something that can be explained to someone who has not gone through the immigration process for a few years. But it is the most liberating feeling ever.<p>The beauty about the space we are involved in, is that we can start a startup from anywhere.<p>You don't have to live in the US. The truth is, I never saw myself moving back home either, but after I got married (she isn't an American) and had my first child - we decided it was best to raise him at home (where there is more help).<p>However, once my startup reaches a point where I can expand, I plan on opening an office or some sort of presence in the US - which essentially allows you to get a green card - once you are creating enough jobs, and invest enough in the US.<p>So don't feel like going degree -> H1-B -> green card is the only way.<p>All in all, I don't know your particular situation, but going home might not be ALL that bad. Especially if you can work on your startup and be earning USD living in a country with much lower cost of living.<p>Just my $0.02.",1276668188

If your goals are modest then it's possible that you could reach your goals. If you manage to line up 5-6 things over two years, that could be a healthy income.<p>However, if you really want to create wealth â€” for yourself and for the world â€” then you need to recognize that humans are really bad at identifying problems that really need solving. You need to pack your virtual bags and go deep into the country, looking for communities of users that you'd never consider in your normal every day life.<p>Start researching industrial organizations, hobby clubs, non-technical groups of all kinds. Lurk on their forums and pay attention to the problems that they have. Take notes. Not every problem is a potential business, but there is a world of opportunity out there.<p>Go in the opposite direction as everyone else. Recognize that often low-tech solutions are best. Listen more than you speak. You will find people who desperately need you to help them, and in doing that you will likely get further ahead than building a Shopify also-ran.<p>Good luck.",1276668167

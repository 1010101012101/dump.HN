My total take home would probably be comparable to that of a person making less but paying for room and board. I say this with the assumption that those who skipped post-secondary education in favor of a job moved out of their homes almost immediately.<p>So where are those types of values in the calculations?<p>Now that I've graduated my starting job is ~$60k with a $20k annual raise once I've been in this position for a little over three years. There's not one friend that started work directly out of school that I can say that for.<p>Not to mention my degree allows me to venture to the upper ends of this company where education is a requirement while they'll plateau in seniority because of that.<p>Again, way too many variables and gray areas for us to do a number to number comparison because no two situations are identical and the idea of ""average"" or ""typical"" probably only makes up a small percentage of personae anyway.",1320263988

The distinction between owning an asset and licensing one results in them actually not having anything, valueless or otherwise.<p>Getting a license is different than owning an asset because you don't own anything, but rather someone gives you permission to make use of an asset that they own (or have control over). The only right that the license covered, was the right to sue people infringing on the copyright. The finding in court was that you cannot license just this right and no others. Thus, RH never really obtained this right.<p>So, in total, RH does in fact have nothing: they never had an asset of any sort, and the right that they attempted to obtain by licensing was determined not obtainable by licensing. The only thing they they attempted to obtain was the legal permission to utilize that asset; having found that permission is non-transferable, they have nothing at all.",1320263932

Those similar restrictions - in Java - make extending an existing library much more difficult since you can't do things like add methods to an existing class/object; that method has to exist elsewhere & take the object you're extending as a parameter.

So insofar as post-secondary is about the stuff you learn in class, college is awesome.  And I used to recommend it highly to any high-school-student who would listen.<p>However, there are some other benefits that are in short supply at colleges.  Your peers will, on average, be less intelligent and less dedicated.  And even if your peers are worth cultivating, you won't be living dorms, which means less parties (could be a pro or a con), but also means less close bonding with those same peers.  Your instructors will not have openings in their labs where you can work for slave wages during the summer, getting five times as much real education as you got the preceding 8 months.<p>And ALSO, ""cut the price in half"" is completely disingenuous.  Tuition is a fraction of the total cost of school: there's fees and books, of course.  But more importantly, there's opportunity cost, usually represented by some kind of unskilled pay, perhaps $20k/year.  In Vancouver in the early 2000s, college will run you roughly $250/course, and university $500/course.  That sounds like half the price, until your calculation includes that $20k/year in lost salary (plus $1k-$2k in fees and supplies).  Suddenly it's a $26k vs $22k, which is no savings worth talking about.",1320263403

When you're sheltered and protected until you're an adult, you are, in effect, prepped and ready for college.  You're ready to be told what to do, ready to follow the course requirements, and do what the other students do.<p>A lot of the commenters on here keep saying how students would be better off trying their hands at startups or reading/self-educating on the side--basically anything but taking a huge debt load on for a poor investment.  You're asking people to think for themselves and find their own road.<p>When you've been sheltered and protected your whole life, you're not ready to find your own road!

My best guess is that this is different because there's more of a recognition that people are looking.  How does this change the dynamics?<p>2) My guess is that this is going to be kind of a platform for matchmakers too.  What, if anything, do they get out of it?<p>3) Will the businesses hosting/benefiting from the event pay a cut of their proceeds to TLF?<p>4) Will people who meet on the site attend the events as pairs?  Or will it be like a singles event?  If the latter, then we'll see an ""alpha male"" problem where a handful of males will be desired.  The betas will drop out and more importantly many women will be turned off by the competition for a few men.<p>5)  Finally, and most importantly, any play in the dating space is most likely not going to be a tech play (that's been done - OKCupid and eHarmony among many others have all sorts of fancy algorithms).  Like most social media today, the business model will stand or fall based on very nuanced understanding of human nature, in particular very nuanced understanding of male/female romantic and sexual interactions.<p>Now, no offense, but when I think of ""very nuanced understanding of male/female romantic and sexual interactions""  the image of two college guys who read HN does not come to mind.  Nothing personal, I would apply the same reasoning to myself (which is one of the reasons I have not started a dating site).  It's just something to be aware of, you're stepping into an area that is one of the most misunderstand social arenas for our species.<p>All of the above are just my musings intended to plant some seeds in your head.  I think this is a great idea and you should go for it with gusto.<p>The only real advice I have: If you don't already have one, get a woman on your team.

If you simply attend, sit in the audience, and listen to some of the talks, with rare exceptions I would argue that the cost isn't worth it for <i>any</i> conference. You'll notice that many conferences put videos of their talks onlinefor free. There's a reason for this: the talks are not the most valuable aspect of the conference; rather, the rest of the experience at the conference is the precious part.<p>This isn't to say that the talks are unimportant. The quality of speakers reflects on the quality of the conference as a whole and the speakers set the stage for the great discussion that will flow from there. At a conference, you'll sit in the audience and listen to some really intelligent person speak about a given topic, and people really get into what that person has to say; but the real magic comes just after the speaker finishes. You'll notice that those that really found the talk interesting will rise from their seats and rush to the stage, crowding around the speaker to engage her in discussion. Fellow attendeesspeakers or otherwisewill further break off into their own groups to keep the conversation flowing.<p>So, if you think of a conference as a novel, then imagine the speakers as the main characters. While they keep the plot flowing, it's really the other charactersthe attendeesthat tie everything together and make the main characters worthwhile.<p>Additionally, you'll find yourself thrown into a large group of people where you are both stronger than others in some areas and weaker than other attendees in different areas. This tends to be any geek's best dreamyou're simultaneously around people from whom you can learn and to whom you can impart knowledge, which means that you're in an environment that fosters creativity and open discussion.<p>You won't remember everything that you learn at a conference. That isn't the point. Instead, you'll be introduced to a wide range of new ideas, and you'll take that new perspective back to work or other areas of your life and apply it accordingly. For example, I saw Nathan Marz's talk at Strange Loop 2011, where he open-sourced Storm. For days after (and, frankly, even as I was working on something just the other day), ideas that he put forth in that talk have resonated in my mind, and I've architected solutions to numerous problems in ways that I otherwise would not have imagined, all because I was exposed to a different point of view.<p>This benefit is what just <i>one</i> speaker has done for menow imagine how powerful this is when you're exposed to 20, 40, or even 60 different speakers! The benefit continues to grow as you talk not just with speakers, but with fellow attendees as well, absorbing their newly gained snippets of knowledge and sharing some bits of your own.<p>For these reasons I would say that, while $450 can indeed be a lot of money, it isn't just applied to the two days that you will be at a conference. Instead, it continues to work for you through the lessons learned andperhaps even more importantlypeople met.",1320263190

I often found clients on the server who hadn't paid anything for years. Now most invoicing web applications have recurring invoices but with lots of clients and websites it becomes a faff to track the payments. So I'm wondering if there is space for a a super simple client hosting billing web app for web agencies.<p>1. Enter you client name, domain name, monthly / yearly price.<p>2. Client gets an email and sets up recurring payment via PayPal.<p>3. If payment fails you get a notification and can manually take action.<p>I also run a web app called Flaregun (http://getflaregun.com) which monitors domain name expiry and SSL certificate expiry. It's like an insurance policy for web agencies. These features would be included as 'perks' to make it stand out from other general billing / invoicing tools.<p>If you charge clients for hosting it would be great if you could answer a few quick questions and share your thoughts on the idea:<p>1. How did / do you bill your clients for hosting? Do you use software or raise invoices manually?<p>2. If you use software which do you use? Is your solution satisfactory?<p>3. Is online recurring payment a major benefit? I presume the pain of sending out individual invoices for client hosting is that you then need to track and chase payments which is time consuming.<p>4. Do you bill monthly or yearly?<p>5. Would you pay for the above automated billing system? If so how much? If not why not?<p>Thanks for your time,",1320263129

(Obligatory: <a href=""http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Negative_2000_Lines_Of_Code.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&s...</a> )<p>That said, decent ergonomics are almost always a good thing. Even if you're not typing a lot, you'll probably still spend a lot of time looking at the screen.  Having a bad setup maybe doesn't matter for your wrists in this case but it can still be detrimental to your eyesight and of course your back.<p>Maybe that's why sliverstorm got downvoted: there are good reasons to care about ergonomics even if you're not typing a lot.<p>(For what it's worth, my excuse is convenience: I'm working in lots of different places and I can't be bothered to lug around a huge notebook or an external keyboard.  Before the age of notebooks I used to have a fairly ergonomic setup with a big screen and the awesome 1st gen Microsoft Natural Keyboard, and I often do miss it: maybe I'll return to such an ""immobile"" setup next time I have a job with a desk.)",1320262361

Whitespace is negative space, used for contrast to draw attention to positive space, which could be your copy, let's say. Use a grid to make sure you keep everything aligned and to help you figure out where to put stuff in.<p>I really like Futura or Baskerville for headers, and I think you should pick a bright, contrasting color against the body copy.<p>Gradients and Box shadows do look really cheesy with just CSS. The trick is that you should always add a little noise, somewhere between 1 or 2 percent, to your gradients or shadows so you can make them look more textured instead of just flat colors. There's a filter called ""Film Grain"" which I think is much  better than ""noise"", but it's usually an external plugin. You're gonna have to hit photoshop for that, because I don't know if there is a noise/grain css effect.",1320262297

At my college, they've made it too easy- I know someone graduating with a CS degree who couldn't accurately state the purpose of a compiler.

We need a system where retaking a class is considered as normal rather than as a failure.<p>Failing a class you didn't understand so you retake it is infinitely better than passing a class without understanding core concepts. Physics is calculus-based, and to teach it otherwise is to provide a lacking education. GPA isn't important- the point of an education is to learn and develop skills.<p>What I find more problematic than STEM drop-out rates is the attitude of many liberal arts students that math is something you can either do or can't do.

There is a Java library here: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/boxer-bayesian-regression/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/boxer-bayesian-regression/</a>  If you're going to do per user and per exercise models you'll have many fewer data points to train your models on. You should consider sharing data between models or use a model that will give some measure of uncertainty in it's predictions. The Bayesian LR code I referenced above will give some measure of uncertainty. There is a stack of (really interesting) work on other methods that will also do this.",1320261639

3188459,comment,3187027,3188402,4,0,puredanger,,,"As someone that puts on conferences (including this one), this is something I've spent unhealthy amounts of time thinking about and it's a question any sane person should ask.<p>There are really two (well 3) things you should hope to get out of a conference.<p>1) Information.  The most visible reason to go to a conference is to extract information from speakers in a direct form.  Whether this actually ""works"" depends largely on whether you (the attendee) have the right prior knowledge and expectations and whether the speaker has the ability to teach you something.  If either of those is wildly off, the session will be a miss.  My goal as an organizer is to find great speakers and make expectations as clear as possible to both attendees and speakers so that this connection is maximized.<p>That said, there are many books, videos, tutorials, blogs, etc on Clojure (or any other topic).  Will you learn better from a teacher than a book?  Maybe.  Hard to say.  Sometimes seeing a talk live forces a focus and clarity that you would not otherwise have.  In short, I can't answer this for you. :)  But I will work hard to create the environment for it.<p>2) Relationships.  AKA the ""hallway track"".  This is something that is much harder to get through online learning - meeting and creating relationships with the people creating and using the technology.  For many people it is hard to quantify this value (unless you're trying to get a job or something very concrete).  But I'd say this is every bit as important as #1.<p>3) Inspiration.  This one is even more elusive, but a conference with the right speakers and audience can be electric and inspire you to learn and create.  Clojure is a young and exciting community right now with a ton of crazy smart people.  I find it quite energizing to be talking to people in the context of that.<p>You may find that taking a training course (which we will be offering prior to the conference), gets the really hard focus on #1 which is what you want.  However, that training will certainly be more than $450. :)",1320261412

If you expand your buying options to second-hand hardware out of warranty, you can pick up older but Lion capable C2D Macbooks for less than $300. If you're <i>really</i> hard up for cash, you can even build Lion-capable Hackintoshes for a little under $250.",1320260596

But anyone who wants to start a dating startup has to answer two questions: in addition to the usual question about how you're going to approach dating differently, you have to answer the even more important question of how to overcome the huge chicken and egg problem every dating site faces. A site like Reddit is interesting when there are only 20 users. But no one wants to use a dating site with only 20 userswhich of course becomes a self-perpetuating problem. So if you want to do a dating startup, don't focus on the novel take on dating that you're going to offer. That's the easy half. Focus on novel ways to get around the chicken and egg problem.""<p>From <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/ideas.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/ideas.html</a>",1320260472

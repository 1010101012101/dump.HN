8263624,comment,8260549,8262971,1,0,TheLoneWolfling,,,"Most of the time this is handwaved over, for bunches of reasons. Part of it is that there is no one valid frame of reference: you can&#x27;t just say &quot;this stays stationary&quot; - because what does that even mean? Stationary relative to what?<p>If you mean &quot;you go wherever inertia would take you in that amount of time, with no acceleration&quot;, then if you go backwards a multiple of a year you end up pretty close to Earth (quick approximation: the Sun&#x27;s acceleration in its orbit in the milky way is ~2*10^-10m/s/s, which works out to ~100km in a year, ~400km in two years, etc.). In actuality you could probably get somewhat better range by letting your velocity build up to intercept Earth-that-was at the target time. (You&#x27;d need to take into account a bunch of things for best accuracy: the Earth&#x27;s orbit is not &quot;perfect&quot;, the moon&#x27;s phase, the acceleration of the Sun, etc, but we know most of that.)<p>You probably would end up needing to make multiple jumps, pausing in-between to let Earth&#x27;s (or another planet&#x27;s, or even the Sun&#x27;s) gravity well readjust your velocity to what is needed for your next jump.<p>This means that you&#x27;d need to build in re-entry capability into the machine (as you are unlikely to have the precision necessary to be able to jump into atmosphere at a sane velocity), and potentially maneuvering delta-v. Note that with a time machine you lose conservation of momentum, which makes things a lot easier. You can change the direction of your velocity vector by jumping back in time and interacting with your past self. You can potentially use this to get &quot;free&quot; (read: reactionless) velocity out of any gravity well.",1409759955

8263622,comment,8262617,8263352,16,0,pron,,,"Author of Quasar here and apparently the target of the criticism in the article. It&#x27;s kind of hard to make out the main claim the author has, but let me respond to the few more specific claims:<p>1. ForkJoin is not &quot;notorious for its overhead&quot;. In fact, it is among the best implemented, best performing work stealing schedulers out there. Scheduling a task with ForkJoin takes a few nanos, and is almost as cheap as a plain method call. Don&#x27;t take my word for it: go ahead and benchmark it.<p>2. Like Go, Quasar doesn&#x27;t constrain the running code from mutating shared state -- if you&#x27;re using Quasar from Java, that is. But it&#x27;s still just as useful as Go, and when used from Clojure, it&#x27;s even more flexible than Erlang, and actually quite safe.<p>3. My macbook isn&#x27;t cruddy.<p>4. The stuff possible with Quasar, like running a plain Java RESTful service on fibers to gain a 4x increase in server capacity -- without changing the code and without even starting to parallelize the business logic with actor/CSP -- speaks for itself.<p>5. I&#x27;m not spreading FUD on threads -- you can watch my talk at JVMLS (linked in the article) to see my precise point: kernel threads cannot be used to model, one-to-one, domain concurrency, because the concurrency requirements of modern application (and the capabilities of modern hardware) exceed by several orders of magnitude the number of threads supported by the kernels. Fibers keep the (excellent) abstraction provided by threads as the unit of software concurrency, while making the implementation more suitable for modern soft-realtime workloads. When your average programmer can spawn up a (lightweight) thread without thinking about it -- say one for each request, and even many more, concurrency becomes a lot easier.<p>6. The linked Paul Tyma slide are completely irrelevant. I&#x27;ve got nothing against doing kernel-thread-blocking IO. The problem becomes writing simple, yet scalable code to process incoming requests. Modern hardware can support over a million open TCP sockets, but not nearly as many active kernel threads. Asynchronous libraries give you the scalability but fail on the simplicity requirement; fiber-blocking IO gives you both the performance and the simplicity of blocking code.<p>7. As to the &quot;strawman benchmark&quot; with &quot;too many threads&quot;, the author is welcome to repeat the experiment using a thread pool with as few or as many treads as he&#x27;d like -- the result would be the same: switching kernel threads costs about 10-20us, while task-switching fibers costs 0.5us (and can be improved).<p>> few existing libraries understand what your application is trying to do with green threads<p>That&#x27;s exactly the purpose of the Comsat project, which integrates existing third-party libraries with Quasar fibers. You&#x27;re right, integrating &quot;inverted&quot; frameworks does require more work, but so far Comsat integrates, servlets, JAX-RS services and Dropwizard.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/2014/05/29/cascading-failures/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/2014/05/29/cascading-failure...</a>",1409759951

I have seen abstract computer-driven neural nets that fire independently and in (more) continuous time, are plastic, lack clear layers, etc.<p>I think when you said: &quot;but I&#x27;m talking about a neural net as a specific mathematical model here&quot; that is fair, you are asserting that while this model similar to a biological one at some very primitive level the model of neural net used here is so far removed for our biological implementation as to render any comparison non-meaningful. I believe that is possible, but we still have discussed evidence that is the case.<p>I thought it might not be &quot;silly&quot; question: Consider that a turning machine simulated with pencil and paper, given enough paper and time is capable of doing any calculation your desktop computer can. Now it may take 10,000+ years and many &quot;operators&quot; lives, but that is besides the point.<p>I was thinking that the comparison between the pencil and paper turning machine and the desktop machine, might be similar to the this very basic neural net model and our own much more complex biological instance. The idea is that the two systems while varying vastly in efficiency might equivalent in what they can theoretically compute.<p>I don&#x27;t see how asking the question of how much we can simplify our biological neural net and still have be computationally equivalent to the original (even if less efficient) is a silly question.<p>(I don&#x27;t like silly, it implies the question is not worth asking.

When it turned out Postgres was dog slow on the old-ass hardware the devs were using they just implemented their own lightweight db and mSQL became the top pick for new OSS-based systems. But mSQL was commercially licensed, so MySQL was created for personal use. Since it reused the same API as mSQL, everyone just adopted MySQL as a &#x27;drop-in&#x27; replacement. So MySQL is lightweight and fast and free and Postgres is a dog slow incumbent.<p>I guess you could compare it to how many people feel Java is a humongous pig that can&#x27;t scale and PHP is fast and lightweight. And obviously lots of sites use PHP. But some shops choose Java because they want something PHP can&#x27;t offer. (Note: this is not a fair comparison to MySQL and Postgres in any way, but it shows the weird &#x27;feelings&#x27; people get for different software)<p>But also: MySQL has more DBAs, a higher number of installations, more 3rd party support, bigger user/dev community, and in general is more popular.<p>> technically, is MySQL less capable than Postgres?<p>Each has individual technical benefits and drawbacks the other doesn&#x27;t have.<p>> Would it be wrong to start a new business on MySQL?<p>What, like, ethically?<p>MySQL is just a tool. I could &#x27;bash&#x27; a table knife by saying it&#x27;s a dull, heavy piece of shit compared to some other knife, but guess what? Everyone uses table knives.

There are more than 5,000 rare genetic diseases, in total affecting millions of Americans, and our serious goal is to find treatments for 100 rare diseases in the next 10 years. We’ll need the best minds out there to help us make that happen.<p>Our approach is to model rare genetic diseases in human cells, then use these disease models to find drugs that revert the cells to a healthy state, and thus are strong candidates for impacting the disease in patients. In a pretty quick experiment, we image millions of human cells. Image segmentation and analysis quickly makes thousands of measurements, resulting in a very deep quantitation of the state of every single cell. The challenge at hand is running the right experiments in the right way and analyzing results to make the discoveries we seek as quickly as possible.<p>My two co-founders developed the basis of our approach at the University of Utah, using it to find two very promising candidates for a serious and fairly common genetic disease. We’re moving those candidates forward, and at the same time adapting the approach to address the thousands of other untreated rare genetic diseases as quickly as we can. I joined them to start this company because this is the best chance I’ve found for a software/stats person to make such a huge impact on the lives of millions of people. I also believe that imaging-based biological experiments are going to be a big part of the wave of advancement coming to treating and curing diseases in the next two decades.<p>--<p>Software Engineer (Python):<p>- You have several years of experience in python software development, preferably using ipython and other scientific python tools. You’re also super-comfortable at the command line and handling the standard a linux server, and great at solving any kind of computational issue via stackoverflow. No sysadmins, DBAs or the like will be around to help for a while.<p>- You’re motivated by challenging problems, and by the idea of making millions of patients’ lives dramatically better, as fast as we can.<p>- You’ll work with biologists and data scientists to develop tools to manage and automate our experiments and analyses. To manage the experiments and analyses it will take to treat 100 diseases in 10 years, we’ll need a pretty amazing set of systems in place eventually, but need to get there incrementally so that we can make rapid progress immediately using the resources we have.<p>--<p>Lead Data Scientist (Python):<p>- You have several years of experience in statistics, machine learning, and software development solving problems and answering questions efficiently using lots of data, preferably using ipython and lots of python’s scientific programming tools. We’re not hadoop-scale for now, but every experiment can generate hundreds of gigs of quantitative measurements.<p>- You’re ready to take on any problem and figure out the best solution you can with available time, having fun in the process.<p>- Maybe you already know some biology, but if you don’t, you’re excited to learn what you need to (we’ll help, of course!) in order to really understand our data and approach.<p>- You’re motivated by challenging problems, and by the idea of making millions of patients’ lives dramatically better, as fast as we can.<p>- You’ll come to understand our experiments and data at a visceral level and help us guide the direction of our experiments and our company towards our goals.<p>- You’ll work with our biologists to guide our design/experiment/analyze cycle towards getting the most impactful biological information from the most rapid and cost-effective experimental approaches. This includes researching, suggesting and testing different statistical and machine learning approaches, along with changing our experimental setup to provide more useful information with every round of exeriments.

For the past couple of months in my new place, I couldn&#x27;t figure out why that no matter how much sleep I got, I still woke up absolutely drained and tired. Other sleep tracking apps showed nothing out of the ordinary in my sleeping patterns and they even matched previous sleep cycles.<p>After the first night of using Pillow, I immediately found the problem. I learned that throughout almost the entire night I would go into these throat-scratching fits. The reason the other apps didn&#x27;t show anything is because my movement didn&#x27;t change, I would just lay there and scratch my throat. On a recording it sounds like a frog croaking. Except this would go on for 15-20 minute intervals nearly 8 times throughout the night. This was a clear sign of my allergies; whenever I&#x27;m awake and up and I knowingly make that sound, it&#x27;s because something is irritating my allergies to such a degree that &quot;throat-scratching&quot; helps soothe it. Now I take a generic Zyrtec before bed, and I sleep like a baby again.<p>Now this wasn&#x27;t a very scientific test (I didn&#x27;t use Pillow or attempted audio-recording before I moved into the new place), but it showed me how easily this information could help me and my doctors.

We brought together a talented team of developers and marketers, as well as individuals with years of experience in real estate development. We built a business plan. We found office space, which we shared to save costs. We secured our first round of investment. And we spent countless hours developing the game - all while legally dotting all of our i’s and crossing all of our t’s along the way. We were starting to see all of our efforts paying off.<p>Then, we got sued by Square, Inc. – the payment processing company. It turns out we were not the only victims. Square, Inc. also sued other startups with the word “square” in their names. Apparently, Square, Inc. feels that it has the monopoly on the word “square,” and it doesn’t matter that there’s no likelihood of confusion (to use the trademark parlance) between our real-life virtual game and Square Inc.’s payment processing business. It’s only a matter of time before Square, Inc. insists that Moscow’s Red Square or Beijing’s Tiananmen Square change their names.<p>What are we going to do?<p>We’re moving forward. We just launched our new version and our developers are pushing hard to make new features the next month. We feel we’ve invested a lot in our name and our brand, and we’re not backing down just because a larger company feels it can bully startups into submission.<p>This is a very realistic issue that many startups and founders may face. We are going to fight it and believe our startup will survive, because we do it for the love of the game.<p>We encourage all startups and founders to follow their passion and persevere in the face of adversity.<p>Boris \nCo-Founder, Cashsquare",1409757305

8263352,comment,8262617,8262617,13,0,heavenlyhash,,,"I can&#x27;t help but wonder if the article of the author has seen Quasar: <a href=""http://docs.paralleluniverse.co/quasar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.paralleluniverse.co/quasar/</a>  It seems to be a concrete refutation of his claims of impossibility.  Quasar successfully brings green threads to the jvm.  It includes both channels as are now popularized by golang, as well as higher level patterns like actors.  Despite the young nature of the framework, benchmarks show it comparing reasonably well with both golang and erlang.  Quasar also provides libraries that step all the way up into the OTP realms of supervision trees (though I haven&#x27;t myself used this, yet).<p>The article mentions bytecode weaving, but dismisses it with very wavery justifications.  Bytecode manipulation tools are a successful part of the jvm ecosystem.  Frankly, they&#x27;re part of <i>why</i> I consider the jvm ecosystem so successful: bytecode manipulation has allowed things like:<p>- third party tree-shakers/minifiers and obfuscators (i.e. proguard)<p>- cross compilers (i.e. robovm)<p>- concurrency libraries that DO have real green threads and continuations (i.e. Kilim, Quasar, and others)<p>- code coverage and complexity analysis tooling (i.e. jacoco)<p>- scala<p>- clojure<p>- groovy<p>- kotlin<p>- [... more languages ...]<p>There are two critical points about the above:<p>- All of these tools were built without direct cooperation with the compiler and core tool chain.  That means experimentation and growth were possible from the community.<p>- Everyone&#x27;s tools play nice with each other!  You can use Quasar as a library in Clojure and then feed that bytecode into Proguard for minification, and then add code coverage instrumentation, and then feed it into Robovm!<p>Given the wild success of bytecode and bytecode manipulators, I have no idea how the article can so whimsically poo-poo the entire field.<p>(Yes, I&#x27;m well aware Erlang has a VM that allows alternate languages as well.  And yes, Elixer is pretty.  OT, no, I won&#x27;t be making investments of my time into Elixer, because I like strong compile-time type systems, and Elixer doesn&#x27;t have that.)<p>It is true that even in the presence of a full greenthreading tool like Quasar, code can call legacy APIs that still block a full thread, but this is not sufficient cause to dismiss the possibilities.  To quote back part of the article, blocking will always be an issue in any cooperatively multitasked environment: &quot;There’s no real way to limit what that code can do, unless it is explicitly disallowed from [...] looping.&quot;  And yet I wouldn&#x27;t claim Erlang fails to give me concurrency just because it still allows loops!  Part of the compromise of cooperative multitasking is the very premise that in exchange for the higher performance possible from cooperative code, yes, poorly written code can suck up arbitrary amounts of CPU before yielding.  If this were a practical concern, it would also be entirely possible for a bytecode instrumenting library to inject cooperative rescheduling points even into loops; and yet I have no real desire to see this feature.<p>Furthermore, I strongly object to the claim ForkJoin is &quot;notorious for its overhead&quot;.  All thread synchronization is notorious for its overhead.  That&#x27;s completely known to any programmer with experience in this area, and in no way unique to ForkJoin.<p>For an excellent, in-depth coverage of what exactly ForkJoin is and the problems it solves for you, see <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq0MX3fHkro"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq0MX3fHkro</a> .  I highly recommend watching the entire thing despite its length, and even if you are not a JVM programmer -- even if you&#x27;ve been doing concurrent programmer for years, you will almost certainly walk away knowing significantly more about concurrent scheduling from the (relatively) high levels of memory fencing all the way down to CPU architecture choices and their impacts.<p>I&#x27;m not going to claim there are no issues with something like Quasar.  In particular, I find that it <i>is</i> harder to operate in an ecosystem where very few existing libraries understand what your application is trying to do with green threads.  Mostly, this doesn&#x27;t phase me if my application is calling out to other libraries, because I control the scheduling one step above them (just like I would in a plainer actor framework without green threads like Akka).  The problem is more with &quot;hollywood&quot; style frameworks -- the &quot;don&#x27;t call me, I&#x27;ll call you&quot; type -- so far it feels like these are very hard to use when your application is using green threading, but the calling framework has no clue about it.  Some sort of interfacing code is required and usually has thread handoffs of its own, which can be moderately unpleasant, and limits your scalability at that juncture.  But this is a present-tense bummer, and can be solved by patching (or outright replacing) these hollywood frameworks, or simply avoiding frameworks of that kind altogether.<p>But in short, I still think it&#x27;s a bit unreasonable to dismiss the existence of ponies.",1409756994

Viewed from the side, it would at first glance appear chaotic, but by observing the behavior long enough and recording where the activity occurred over time, you could statistically predict where the strings would be at any given time.<p>However, if you were aware of the number of strings you were viewing and the frequencies at which they were moving, you could formulate a precise theory of exactly what you were viewing and what you would view at every point in the future.<p>That is the current state of physics. Quantum mechanics is seeing without understanding the rules governing the system, so predictions and observations are made using statistics instead of constants.

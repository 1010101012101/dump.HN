I am a biologist myself and curious to find out how far can we go.",1211263134
194769,comment,194070,194632,0,0,Tichy,,,"It wasn't me who wrote the ""never felt bias"" thing.<p>Of course not every women is the same, but I have heard many woman who were frustrated with their job say ""maybe I'll just get pregnant"". Among other things. Sure it is a bias. I am not ashamed to believe that men and women ARE different. I also did not say that every woman would be indifferent to financial prospects of her career, just that many would be.<p>Also I did not say ""isn't it equally true"", I was merely trying to make the point that bias is sometimes correct. Of course it doesn't prove my suggestion that women worry less about their career path. If I had a proof, I would not be writing here, I would publish a scientific paper.",1211263056

194763,comment,194334,194723,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Agreed.  But touring bands do make it to SF at almost the same clip as they made it to Austin...the local scene is significantly less interesting, however, as far as I can tell.  But I might be missing something because I, also, mostly lack the electronica appreciation gene.  I give SF the benefit of the doubt on the music issue since many people do seem to feel it has a good music scene.  I will merely accept that it's not ""my"" music scene, and remain pining for Emo's.<p>And my dog is a rescue mutt of dubious heritage...probably quite a bit of English Pointer descent in her genes, though.  Not huge, but too big to be acceptable to most apartment complexes in the entire bay area--but we found a nice little house near downtown, so it worked out well.",1211262391

Modern understanding of the mind like we have now didn't really exists in decades previous along with better imaging technologies. Is there some reason why we can't build a general learning machine?",1211260719

194745,comment,194734,194734,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Links from other niche-content websites, usually forums.  Google to start the hunt.<p>Here's how I found the HP fandom: I was browsing Salon TableTalk at work because I had nothing to do.  Stumbled upon the Books section, then Harry Potter.  Found that somebody had posted a some fanfiction they'd written (which at the time I thought was the leaked Book 4, because I had no idea what fanfiction was) along with a link to FanFiction.net.  Started reading FanFiction.net.  A few months later, found a review on FF.net that asked where all the good Harry Potter fanfiction had gone, and a reply that said ""A lot of folks have migrated to SugarQuill or FictionAlley.""  That's how I ended up at FictionAlley.<p>I have a similar strategy with music, where I also have very niche tastes.  Heard a Transsiberian Orchestra song on the radio that I absolutely had to find.  Found it on a ratio FTP site, where it was filed in with a bunch of Savatage songs.  Googled Savatage, found out they had the same producer and most of the same musicians.  Checked out the official Savatage fan site, its forum has a section for ""other bands"", kept hearing repeated mentions of Dream Theater.  Downloaded a couple of their songs, bought a couple of their albums.  Checked out their fansite.  There were mentions of a couple upcoming rock operas - Avantasia and Nikolo Kotzev's Nostradamus - that I ended up buying.  My screen name actually came from this period of my life: I was looking for a fandom pen name that I could be reasonably sure would not be in use at any site I registered at, and had just bought the Nostradamus rock opera.",1211259796

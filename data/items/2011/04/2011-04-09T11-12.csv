So it's neither a cool group nor an exclusive one. Whereas a Github t-shirt says, to other coders, ""I am a coder who works with open source.""

Similarly, knowing Latin and Greek had a purely practical motive as well back then: It marked you as a member of the social elite, defined as people who had enough leisure to study objectively useless things such as Latin and Greek.

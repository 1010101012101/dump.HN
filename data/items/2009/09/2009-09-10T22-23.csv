I work on a lot of really awesome networking projects that either don't have web interfaces (various xmpp services) or have ones that need work (buildbot).<p>Instead of filling an obviously missing hole in an existing framework, a new one was created that is missing all of the stuff that the other project has.<p>The twisted http client stuff is quite good.  I used it along with a friend to build a tool that is a realtime (in the web sense) gateway between friendfeed and xmpp clients a couple days after the realtime API was released (before friendfeed launched their own).  It works very well and I still use it today.<p>Unfortunately, if I wanted to build a tool that did similar stuff with a Tornado front-end, I'd have to write a new HTTP client that's compatible with Tornado's event loop (unless I'm mistaken).<p>Everything comes at a cost.  Tornado demonstrably solved Friendfeed's problems quite well, but, as I stated above, I can't use it to solve my problems because even if I rewrote my apps, I'd lose all of the rest of twisted upon which I'm relying.  e.g. I can't just bolt it onto buildbot (which would be so ideal as our web interface is suffering from lack of a framwork, but the backend is <i>really</i> good).",1252621578

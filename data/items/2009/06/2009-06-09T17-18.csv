649492,comment,649366,649366,0,0,strlen,,,"I've gotten my first job <i>ever</i> after being contacted by a recruiter (at 17, as still a high school student no less!). Got my first position out of college with no connection (applied online, during my senior year, in response to an ad on my university's CSE department's web page).<p>Left that job to go to a start-up where I was introduced to the founders through a connection. The problem is that (initially to me) the position didn't seem sufficiently technically challenging to me (standard LAMP development), so my connection ended up both a) ""selling"" the position to me b) ""selling"" me to the founders (who in turned tried harder to convince me that the position would be interesting).<p>That's always a sticky issue with referrals: they give additional reasons for hiring a person and a additional reasons for the person to accept the position. The company will feel the referring employee will be happier and more productive if his friend/former co-worker is hired; the referred connection will want a chance to work with someone they already knew and enjoyed working with. Problem is that these reasons can detract from the real questions at hand: ""is this person a good fit for the position"" (for the employer) and ""is this a position where I know I will be happy"" (for the employee). <i>Neither</i> side should be trying hard to <i>sell</i> themselves. Note: obviously I am talking about engineering vs. sales. In sales the candidate <i>should</i> be selling themselves (they're expected to sell the product) and <i>should</i> have built up a rolodex of connections in the industry.<p>When it came time to leave the start-up (due to the office moving out of my reasonable commute range and lack of technical challenge meant I wasn't interested in moving yet again), I applied to four companies (three of them <i>big names</i>, one a mid-sized start-up)-- two by sending in a resume in response to online job ads (Dice.com, LinkedIn), one by a contact from a recruiter, one through a referral. Got interviews from all. Got offers from three and (after more sleepless nights than I imagined) chose one-- the one position I didn't get an offer for <i>was</i> the one where I was referred (yes, it was Google).<p>All of this happened in Summer/Fall of 2008, as the market was crashing. So, your mileage may vary. My tips are this: write your resume smartly (<i>show</i> that you're competent, don't tell) tailor the resume (and especially) the cover letter to show that you're <i>passionately</i> interested in <i>that specific job</i>. If you use the UDP Multicast method of sending a resume (blast out 100 copies of it to 100 different positions), as expected with UDP Multicast, don't expect it to be processed. Apply <i>only</i> to jobs you (judging from the job description) feel you will be happy to do (which will make displaying passion and interest in that position very easy).<p>Here are some good resume tips (although I've read them after writing my resume): <a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/09/ten-tips-for-slightly-less-awful-resume.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/09/ten-tips-for-slightl...</a><p><a href=""http://www.globalnerdy.com/2007/09/26/steve-yegges-resume-tips-the-not-so-long-winded-version/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.globalnerdy.com/2007/09/26/steve-yegges-resume-ti...</a> (in case your response towards the first link is ""TL;DR"")",1244569832

People get bullied all the damn time, if for no other reason than they simply don't confront the bully.<p><i>It's not valuable in adult life.</i><p>I would suggest that it is. There will come a time where your child will be bullied, physically or not, and you will not be around or able to help them. Their ability to believe in their own self-worth and the notion that regardless of the challenges in front of them; whether they are afraid or whether the outcome is certain to cause them pain; they will not subject themselves to being unfairly treated by their peers. They are who they define themselves to be; as important and valuable than any other person.<p>While I don't believe that physical violence is necessary to learn this, instilling the ""fight back"" notion into a child is. From my non-scientific observance, parents that are unwilling to let their child fight are usually the same ones that consistently duck from facing challenges head on. There is something to be said for being afraid and acting anyway that many people just fail to grasp.<p>To think of the number of teens and adults with all sorts of confidence issues, from depression to addiction to being unable to operate without the approval of others - even if it is against their self interest! I can't help but wonder how many of them have never been taught to respect themselves first.",1244568972

Unsurprisingly, all the cliches held: the bully had been in fights with most of the boys on the bus; the school was completely unresponsive to requests for intervention; and the parents of the bully didn't care.<p>For the first time, I forced my son into an activity - martial arts. After a few months, it gave my son the confidence to stand his ground against his tormentor and fight back. Again, unsurprisingly, my son served his first, and the bully his fifth, suspension for violating the ""zero tolerance"" for throwing fists in school. It was a great life lesson about fairness. He has not had a problem since.<p>Most kids, esp boys, will be bullied at some time, but I shuddered at the thought of my son being the constant target every year.",1244568945

Copy and paste? MMS? Voice memos? Search? You've got to be kidding me. The competition has had that stuff for ages.<p>If Apple couldn't deliver that stuff on day one that's fine, but it should have been released in an update shortly afterward. It's absurd that 2 years later people are still waiting for basic functionality that's been available elsewhere the whole time.<p>Don't get me wrong. Although I choose not to use the iPhone, I still like it. Despite the fact that it does some very basic things badly or not at all, it does have some neat features and has driven the competition to work a little harder. The iPhone made mobile app stores commonplace. The 'find my phone' and 'remote wipe' features are very cool and I haven't seen those on another phone. I'm looking forward to how the competition responds.<p>What does bother me, though, is all the Apple apologists coming out of the woodwork to brush all of their faults under the rug. Apple does some good things and some not so good things. In my opinion, a lot of the features in this update are things that people should not still be waiting for.

In my case, the principal bully -- the leader of a pack who all engaged in the bullying -- was the son of a higher level school official; some of the school staff saw it occurring but took no action, I speculate out of fear of retribution.<p>For my part, I was also confused and frustrated by the situation.  I had no desire to fight the fellow, and I didn't understand where this aggression was coming from.  I also literally didn't know how to fight.  No one ever taught me even the basics.<p>The psychological impact was strong enough that I will live with it, to some extent, for the rest of my life.<p>My recommendations to a parent or mentor would include:<p>+ Ensure the child is trained in self-defense.  I will not allow any child of mine to be without such training.  The purpose is not to become aggressive and controlling of others.  It is to learn to remain centered and in control of oneself, and hopefully in control of the situation.  At least in control of one's reaction to it.<p>+ Understand that, per my limited reading, bullying <i>is</i> an <i>effective</i> social strategy.  Perhaps that may change as society evolves, but it has and does serve the purpose of promoting the bully and gaining them certain rewards.  Not that the bullying is necessarily a conscious, pre-meditated decision with such rewards as the known and expected outcome.  However, it is not a purely pathological social aberration.  As such, it is something that will appear and that will need to be addressed.  Saying it is ""wrong"" and ""unfair"" does not help the victim in dealing with the situation.  Creating a social structure that aids the victim while mediating the bullying does.  However (again), the individual cannot count on others always fostering such a social structure.  The individual needs to be able to take care of themself.  From that standpoint, they may then also be in a position to help foster a social environment that mediates against bullying.<p>+ Modern society seems to me to have created a bit of a ""Lord of the Flies"" situation.  Many parents' daily lives are so separated from those of their children.  Kids spend 8, 10 hours away from their parents in social environments that are strongly weighted towards their peer group, with limited participation by teachers, coaches and such as supervising adults.  An entire subculture develops largely independent of broader society.  Kids can end up very vulnerable within this.  And the culture's message and influence is often to <i>not</i> communicate problems to adults.  This reinforces the isolation of the victim.",1244568158

And, of course, secure off-site backups are almost unheard of (actually making backups secure from attackers that have root access is a pretty hard problem; or, at least, one that requires two machines).<p>Anyway, I've experienced it a few times in my career, and I can say with confidence that there are very few worse feelings than knowing a mistake you've made has caused someone major data loss.",1244566991

Corner a coworker at your office, shove them, stick a finger too close to their face while raising your voice: you're fired. Is your boss dumb enough to let it go, or worse, participate? Guess what: when employees sue, you lose, <i>no matter what</i>.<p>Why should my kids waste a moment's time trying to handle violence and physical intimidation on their own? That's teaching them to handle problems with both hands tied behind their back. I want my kids handling problems smart, and ""fighting back"" and standing up to bullies on their own terms is playing to lose.<p>There is all sorts of low-grade kids-stuff nonsense that doesn't need to be escalated. But we're not talking about that here. We're talking about kids who are so persistently targeted and oppressed by this juvenile bullshit that they're considering withdrawing from academic programs.<p>Fuck that shit. If my son tells me he's quitting band because he's getting pushed around over it, I am going fucking ballistic.<p>(For whatever it's worth, both my kids spend a good chunk of their discretionary time in martial arts. But they're doing that on its own merits, not as a tool to deal with behavior that would be <i>overtly criminal</i> if it occurred between adults.)",1244566938

Also, you should probably get a better idea of what you want and what programs are good before investing the time and money, because it will likely be a large investment of both.<p>UIUC has one of the top ranked CS departments. You should already be aware of the rankings and each program's specialization before making this kind of investment, otherwise you might end up spending a lot money and time on something that you'll regret.<p>The last time I checked, there were a number of highly ranked CS departments that offered online courses, the UIUC program being among them. Sometimes they only offered a special degree, others only offer online classes for a certain specialization. The acceptance rates also vary dramatically, but they'll always act like they are highly selective. There have been multiple times that I've learned of supposedly selective programs (in CS and other fields) that actually have extremely high acceptance rates. Other times a program might have extremely low acceptance rates, though, so it's hard to tell.<p>FWIW, I was in an MS program that was mostly paid for by my employer, but decided to do startup work instead, partially because I wasn't happy with the program. I'm glad I took the classes I did, but I wouldn't have been happy had I paid the full tuition.<p>Some things to consider are the dominant platforms and languages in a particular program. Some schools will teach coursework in something like python, but it's much more common to find schools dominated by Java, C++ and Windows (with profs/instructors refusing to deal with anything else), so if you don't like those environments, you'll need to be more selective.",1244566931

The G-1 and iPhone are both pieces of hardware with pre-packaged software on them.  Is there really anything the iPhone's hardware is capable of that the G-1 isn't, in some profound way?  They both have wi-fi, GPS, accelerometer, calculator, touch screen, etc.<p>The iPhone really has become startlingly popular; I think I had a knee-jerk reaction to your article because Apple's incredible aptitude for branding always makes me a little queasy.  People get so excited about Apple that and Apple this, that functional alternatives like the G-1 and Blackberry go unnoticed, and in the end, the market suffers because consumers are complacent instead of asking, ""Can't it be better?""",1244566873

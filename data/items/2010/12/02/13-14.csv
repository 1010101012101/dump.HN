My point was that your 'proof' wasn't proof at all for your stated premise. I suspect this will be hard for you, because I don't have rational reasons to believe that such a sudden drop-off is happening. I don't really <i>know</i> though, I'm just trusting on an abstract 'common sense' approach; the best I have in situation like this where objective measure are not available (to me).<p>Anyway please feel free to share your theories and data on why you think that over such a very short amount of time the level of education will take a sharp drop-off.",1291298335

",,"Hi,<p>My colleague recently posted this article on HN http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1906251 regarding how banks could better use the internet to better serve their customers.<p>We were both really pleased with the level of response and Steve was well armed when going to his meeting. They agreed that almost everything that was said would be hugely beneficial to customers and our bank. Excitingly they are now looking into seeing what could be rolled out and are putting a plan together. Thanks for all your feedback - it was massively appreciated.<p>Steve and I have now been tasked to try and improve the customers experience when they actually go the branch (the physical bank). So I am hoping we may get the same level of response from the HN community again. Is there anything you would like to see in a branch that is currently not there, or does your branch do something particularly useful that others could copy?<p>An example would be rather than give a customer a printed receipt of the transaction that they did in the branch they could instead get an email or a text message.",1291298325

Even then, I'd want references from people I already trusted.  Mining piles of resumes is not the efficient way to find good people, and really, for a lot of roles, I want to know someone is at least a B player, and would love an A; I'd rather a B than someone who may be an A or may be a C.

Those tiny advantages in innate ability are less significant than the general benefits of training-based proficiency for most activities where excellence is required.<p>For example, my doctor doesn't have to be the best in the world to diagnose an illness accurately and prescribe an effective treatment.

Am I the only one that hates the secrecy that recruiters use in describing their clients positions? They make it sound like I might possibly be working for the CIA or something with their lack of details on what matters (e.g. Company name so I can research their history and what they need) and they give me an exhaustive list that nobody could ever possibly have had experience with unless they had already worked at the company! No I don't have 10 years experience with $_OBSCURE_TESTING_PLATFORM, but give me a few hours and Google and I can figure it out. But how can I relay that via a resume?

Bees are dying. There are tortilla riots in Mexico, the highest wheat prices in 30-odd years.” He paused. “The question we have to answer is: How do we kill four of the world’s six billion people in the most just way possible?” He seemed excited to have said this aloud.<p>Wait, is this article about reddit users?",1217602539

When I say working out, I'm specifically talking about pumping iron in a gym.  Yes I'm a programmer, so my definition isn't so much narrow as it is precise, what can I say; that's how we are.  Playing a sport isn't working out, it's playing a sport; that it happens to work you out is not the main point merely a nice benefit.  Where I live, it's 115 degrees outside, working up a sweat is the last thing I want to do, I spend much of my time trying to stop sweating!<p>""Last week, I wondered if I could do five reps of five set of Clean & Press at 185 pounds.""<p>Yes, but can you wonder that a few times a week on a regular basis and continue to get any thrill or sense of accomplishment out of it.  Performance are only motivating when you're trying to improve your performance, but that can't go on forever, at some point you just want to maintain and it's the maintaining, at a gym, that's boring as fuck.<p>I agree you have to find something fun to do that works you out as a side effect, like ""Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu"", which is my whole point.  Pumping iron in the gym, in the long term, is boring as fuck, no matter how you slice it.<p>I haven't found my ""something fun"" yet, maybe I will someday, but good for you that you have.",1217602268

Just wanted to chime in with a response to a couple of these.
 @sysop073 and @thorax - the Netflix connection is right now is more about how easy we want to make it for folks.  We try to take free shipping one step further by sending pre-paid packaging to our customers to send their stuff back to us.
Looking at it longer term, by providing a model where people can sell end of use items to us with no hassle at a fair price, owning a cell phone could start to be more like renting a movie.
@mynameishere - You are right - there are a lot of super shady dealers out there.  However we're not selling to them.  We've invested a lot in the technology and process behind the scenes to develop optimized channels to move the items through.  We're trying to encourage reuse as much as possible - the majority of what we buy isn't junk at all, and in fact has at least one round in the consumer cycle left in it.  We sell some of it directly to consumers ourselves ( <a href=""http://stores.ebay.com/SecondRotation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stores.ebay.com/SecondRotation</a> for example) and have carefully selected wholesale and recycling partners that will take whatever we have.  We're absolutely committed to behaving in an unimpeachably ethical manner.",1217600194

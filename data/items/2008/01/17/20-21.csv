Who is upmodding it and why do they think it is a valuable or even sensible question?  nickb ""does it"" by submitting and commenting a lot...too much, really. There's usually something wrong with outliers.<p>I'm on the ""leaders"" link, but I know perfectly well that plenty of my comments would have had me banned from any real world settings...and that includes comments that got upmodded.",1200603190

Pico is designed for people who occasionally log into a UNIX machine to check mail or something (its origins are in Pine, which is an email client for UNIX newbies). As a programmer you spend all day editing text, so it's definitely worth putting in the effort to learn how to use a good text editor.<p>After a decade of regular use I'm only an intermediate vim user, but what I know so far <i>really</i> helps with my productivity.<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=vim%20tutorial"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=vim%20tutorial</a>",1200601615

99934,comment,99589,99589,0,0,dreish,,,"Applying the Martini Method to coding is not so simple: as has been pointed out countless times, programmer productivity can't be measured in lines of code produced.<p>But maybe something like<p><pre><code>   svn diff | wc -l\n</code></pre>\nis a good enough stand-in.  Replacing a big section of repetitive code with something smaller and more elegant would then count as productivity.  Of course, then it becomes an incentive to write dumb, repetitive code, check it in, and then rewrite it the right way, but probably only for the programmer with more alcoholism than self-respect.",1200601398

Old Kernigan's ""Why Pascal is not my favorite language"" in large part stlil applies today - the damn thing simply wasn't designed to be practical, and I was paid money for nearly 3 years out of college to write Pascal code, this i s probably why I have such a strong opinion about it.<p>Pascal's OOP is about as useless as C#'s compared to power of what multiple inheritance + templates give you, not to mention the true Smalltalk-style message passing.<p>Virtual constructors is not a ""feature"", it's (just like various additions to C#/Java) is an afterthought patch to a rigid static world. This is very typical for created-in-a-lab languages: they were designed with a average Joe programmer in mind, protecting him from shooting himself in a foot, and later on, to make them less painful to use, were given these ""features"".<p>Pascal's came from academia blessed by a traditional and inevitable ""kiss of death"" preventing it from generating a true massive fan following. Compare that to Unix/C/C++ (or Lisp, Smalltalk, Perl, Python, Ruby, etc) that were created by programmers for programmers.",1200601384

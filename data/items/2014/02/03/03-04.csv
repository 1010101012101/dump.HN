7168741,comment,7167841,7167841,3,0,andy_ppp,,,"For me (and I realise this won&#x27;t be popular) - AngularJS is an abomination - every time google plays with front end code they make every attempt to turn it into their own language one that has as little relation as possible to the underlying code that&#x27;s happening.  As we all know, abstractions leak, please avoid and use one of the many other libraries that people can actually follow through and debug without having to learn Angular first.<p>I speak from bitter experience with a product that ended up being two months late because of the decision by a junior Seb to use Angular - I highly recommend avoiding it and learning JavaScript properly and then picking the best tools from NPM that you need.",1391399936

It put code on one side and annotation paragraphs on the other, and despite being very simple I think it did a very good job of making the code and annotations easy to read.<p>[edit] Oh nevermind, I understand.. the colors indicate a block of lines that relate to a single comment. I think that would be clearer if the color didn&#x27;t break between every line. It&#x27;s still tricky mousing over things though. If you go straight down from one line to the next, the comment doesn&#x27;t change. You have to mvoe away from the text entirely, then back onto the line you&#x27;re interested in.",1391399808

Instagram displays an eating disorder help line if you search for &quot;#ana,&quot; &quot;#mia,&quot; or other eating disorder related hashtags.

7168717,comment,7166257,7167902,2,0,blueblob,,,"I think stating that manpages are short is a little inaccurate. The average may very well be 4 pages, but the standard deviation is probably high (bash, gcc, ssh among others have long man pages). A few commands nowadays also have multiple man pages because people don&#x27;t want to search through all the crap that&#x27;s in a normal manpage (ie git, gittutorial, gittutorial-2, Everyday Git, ...).<p>People likely aren&#x27;t going to use manpages-tldr for 4 page man pages. They may use it for gcc which is 17549 lines (without an examples section and examples are littered throughout the page, meaning you have to already know what you&#x27;re looking for).<p>According to Wikipedia, man pages have been around since 1971[1]. Man pages were designed before a paradigm shift from systems oriented to user oriented design and are usually written in a manner that makes them easy to write, not easy to read. If you think about the first time you looked at man pages, they were likely difficult to look through and you just got used to it; that&#x27;s what happened to me.<p>I would guess that most people would like examples of basic usage. The examples section of man pages is normally near the end but it&#x27;s location isn&#x27;t really standardized. I normally end up searching &quot;/^[[:blank:]]*EXAMPLE&quot; and if I don&#x27;t find it I google it.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean that man pages are not useful when you know what you&#x27;re looking for. They can be particularly useful for c code to supplement the headers themselves.<p>I think forcing man pages to be something that they are not isn&#x27;t much better than having a bunch of nonstandard variants. I am not saying that the examples shouldn&#x27;t be added, but man pages are very technical when most people probably want a layman example before the technical details.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page#History</a>",1391399338

Right now, though, I&#x27;m fairly happy with the time I put into this simulation.<p>First of all, there&#x27;s the fact that I did this on a Friday evening, after I came home from work. (I spent about six hours on it, and maybe another hour or two on Saturday morning).  There are probably more productive uses of my time, but it was fun, and the most likely alternative was probably something like &quot;read reddit&quot; as opposed to &quot;do something productive&quot;.  It&#x27;s nice to have leisure-time activities that are at least marginally related to my career.<p>Speaking of which, here&#x27;s a few reasons that this was helpful for me:<p>1. I got a little better at programming in <i>Mathematica</i>.  I use <i>Mathematica</i> a lot for both my teaching and research, so it always helps to practice.<p>2. I learned about a whole field of physics called contact mechanics, which I otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have been aware of.  It&#x27;s part of my job as a math professor to know about random things like this.<p>3. I got some experience with modeling in applied mechanics problems.  This may be helpful for me in the future -- as a professor at Bard, I regularly have to supervise senior math majors who want to work on research-level problems.  The next time a senior who&#x27;s interested in applied mechanics wants a research problem, I&#x27;ll have one available.<p>That&#x27;s how it&#x27;s helpful for me, but I suppose it&#x27;s less clear that this was helpful for the rest of the world.  I guess, at the very least, it certainly seems to have entertained a bunch of people, and maybe someone learned something about modeling or differential equations or physics.",1391398616

In comparison, there&#x27;s a 24-hour burrito place called Freebirds nearby (related lineage, but yet entirely unrelated to other instances of Freebirds if you happen to have one near you: the one in Isla Vista is unique) who have almost an identical mechanic, and yet the staff, many of whom have been working there the entire 15 years I&#x27;ve lived in this area, are able to rapidly organize and serve lines of drunk people going out the door and down the street at 1-2am, and without the burritos falling apart as you attempt to pick them up.

They also provide a central place for your system to download a huge variety of software that has been tested and approved for your specific OS version.<p>>All the hard work of figuring out dependencies, avoiding cycles, etc is done OUTSIDE the OS by the repository maintainers. You can do that on ANY OS.<p>You could, but they don&#x27;t. The fact is that for years prior to the Apple App Store for iPhone or OSX, or the Windows Store, there existed a way to install a wide variety of Linux software automatically and easily from a central source.<p>>Different repositories which the user ads can and do have dependency conflicts. One package from repo-1 can require a lib with version >= 1.0 while another package from another repo-2 will only work with version 0.9, etc. I have often had to add add other repos to get software unavailable in current repos. I have run in to these issues quite often. And I am not even getting into how brittle apt-get in general is.<p>Sure, that&#x27;s true. Personally I&#x27;ve always found the software I need on the main repositories for Ubuntu or Debian, and not needed to add external sources. When there is a package I need that&#x27;s not in a repository, installing a binary or compiling from source has worked fine.

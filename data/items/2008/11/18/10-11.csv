You don't need to know what's going on inside the method, but you do need to know what the method does, which is best accomplished through documentation.<p>O.O is useful to you because it makes it easier to understand your code, especially if your code base becomes very large. You can look at your code object by object rather than line by line.<p>O.O is useful for group projects because each member can code an object and the algorithms behind its methods individually. It also makes it easier to swap different functionality in and out.<p>Finally, O.O also promotes good coding practices, like reusing existing code and writing documentation. It also makes you think about your code's structure, which is crucial to keeping your code maintainable, upgradeable, readable, and reusable.<p>For me, writing good O.O code is a something that I learned after writing a lot of bad O.O code. So there's no reason to delay - write it and you'll see.",1227005852

368096,comment,367212,367772,0,0,demallien,,,"Exactly.  Java developers still have the 98% of computers that aren't old Macs as a customer base.  They probably don't care that 2% of the market is unavailable, and in the odd case that they do care, they'll just have to target Java 1.5, not 1.6.  Not exactly onerous, particularly as the situation is only going to improve going forwards as the last PPC Macs hit EOL.<p>As for Java developers wanting to <i>develop</i> on the Mac, well, I don't know <i>any</i> Mac developers still using PPC Macs as their principle machine.  Actually, I don't know any developer, period, using a computer that is older than about 2-3 years as their principle machine.",1227003482

368092,comment,367212,367898,0,0,demallien,,,"Have you got any actual examples of backward compatibility problems on the Mac?  I've written a few Mac apps that targeted Jaguar, and they still work fine under Leopard.<p>Also, Apple never just pulls the plug on an API - at worst, if you use an API, and then Apple decides to remove the API, the next version of the OS simply lists the API as deprecated, and you get a warning when you compile.  It is only in the following version of the OS that the API <i>may</i> actually be pulled.  I don't think it's unreasonable to expect developers to update their apps every 2-3 years if they want them to keep working.",1227003212

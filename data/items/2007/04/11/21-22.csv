12068,comment,12001,12001,0,0,dfranke,,,"I'm not leaving one but I'm turning down an acceptance.  I never really cared about the PhD credential; grad school is mostly an excuse to spend a few years working on cool stuff on someone else's dime.  But if I work for or start a comparably interesting startup, then I still get that, plus I have a chance to come away rich rather than in debt.",1176328293

12062,comment,11947,11947,0,0,bmck,,,"Wow! The last comment really resonated with me.  I actually went the route of getting the PhD when I ended up in cubicle hxll.  Only then, and with a good bit of consulting and time working for someone else, did it dawn on me to start my own gig.<p>To back up, I'm now almost 40; I finished my PhD when I was 30 after working on-and-off for several years. (I didn't get married until a few weeks ago, actually -- so I didn't have family issues holding me back.) When I did get into the ivory tower and started teaching, I became disgusted with the academic mentality and was fortunate enough to find my way out into my own startup with a ""good"" problem, and contacts to customers.<p>The CS/CmpE degrees taught me irreplaceable critical thinking skills.  I regret not having even thought about the possibility of starting my own gig.  I also regret not having developed or appreciated developing a network of contacts until I was in my 30s; I have found access to investors, entrepreneurs, etc. as not only wonderful from a pragmatic perspective, but also (and more importantly) for vetting out ideas.

12057,comment,11744,11942,0,0,cwilbur,,,"Right - that means that instead of having a camera in whatever room Sean Patrick is in, and long stretches of dead time when he's somewhere that can't be wired for filming, you see Justin's environment all the time no matter where he is.  Bandwidth also means that it can be streaming video rather than a web cam that updates every 20 seconds or so.<p>I'm not sure why this is supposed to be compelling.  The presentation has changed, but the content hasn't.  Or is it that the time is right, and there are enough voyeuristic people and enough revenue to be made from Google ads to make it worth doing?\n",1176325873

Now meeting up is only a matter of making sure everyone make s it. So far most of you want to meet sometimes next week (frankly I am so exited that I would do it tonight, but it would not work for the rest of us). Most of us are suggesting midtown. That is fine. As soon as we know the best time and date  for all we will email and put another post on yc news. \nPS. Everybody seems to have dbe some work with RoR. Well I hate to say it but I am not a coder(please don't be mad), although I like to learn about coding languages. Well maybe this group will throw in some help. LOL.  Can't wait to meet you guys.

People are interested in what I'm doing, interest is building, and I have a lot of ideas to continue improving it.<p>I'll still be looking for some cash, though, because development would go a lot faster if I didn't have to work to pay the bills, and it would help me compete against anybody who might be out there to compete against me.\n",1176325289

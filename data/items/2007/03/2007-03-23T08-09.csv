The hacker clique was born in college, and it will take something to break into it once it has been established and relocates to SF.<p>My point is this--I suspect that relocating yourself to San Francisco with an idea but without hacker friends that already live there (or ones that plan to) isn't going to get you very far.  It would seem that everyone in the valley is very focused on their idea and bringing it to fruition and doesn't have any intention of letting you in on their venture just because you happen to also now live in the Bay Area.<p>Maybe I'm wrong, though; maybe there is a place where post-college hackers in the bay (PCHITB) freely mingle such that newcomers sans partners/friends can enter into their startup, which is otherwise a closed (intentionally so) society; maybe this is a part of the essence of things like Y-Combinator dinners, super happy dev house, etc.  Just thinking outloud at this point. :-)",1174639333

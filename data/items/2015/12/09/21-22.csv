The East India company probably doesn&#x27;t get founded if a British privateer doesn&#x27;t capture a Portuguese carrack loaded with spices and make everyone involved rich enough to be a lord.  For much of its early history, the merchant shipping of the company heartily supplemented their more legitimate trading with raiding their Spanish, Portuguese and Dutch competitors.<p>Even the Royal Navy was a pretty piratical endeavor.  Reading through their wartime exploits, there are a very few big fleet actions, some smaller single-ship actions, and an enormous amount of prize-taking of enemy merchant shipping.  And it makes sense - the captain would get one-quarter to three-eighths of the prize&#x27;s value, with the remainder parceled out down the line to the ship&#x27;s officers and crew.",1449698201

Early Russian history consisted of cultural expansion of Slavic tribes.  Kievan Rus started when Vikings (Varangians) became the rulers of Novgorod (by invitation), then assimilated into Slavic culture and established Kievan Rus (Kiev + various territories along the Dnieper to preserve trade with Constantinople).  They eventually unified the various Slavic lands, won territory from the Khazars (who of course were nomadic Turkic tribes who invaded from the steppes), until Kievan Rus was eventually destroyed by the Mongol Horde, and Russian cities were forced to pay tribute to the Khans.<p>&#x27;Modern&#x27; Russia was established when the Muscovites expelled the Tatars and Mongols from Russia, fought off the Lithuanians, Poles, and others (Arabs, Persians, Germans, French, British, etc...), colonized Siberia (which, much as today, was largely a frozen wasteland), and you get the &#x27;modern&#x27; Russian empire.<p>It&#x27;s history, though bloody from various conflicts, didn&#x27;t involve massive conquest or colonialism (unlike the Khazars, Khans, Tatars, Poles, Lithuanians, Swedes and Germans they fought against).

Is that all a homeless person needs?<p>For me what I needed, because I came from a place that of violence and abuse, was to feel safety of person and possession.<p>In many ways, that sense of security trumped everything.<p>And if you take a teenager that has gone through that and chosen the street over a roof at home... then changing the roof and being surrounded by strangers, some of whom suffer from mental illness and can be violent themselves... a hostel doesn&#x27;t deliver on safety.<p>I only stayed in a few, they were how I imagine US summer camps to be. Rooms containing a number of bunk beds, anything from 4 to 8 people in a room.<p>The ones I experienced separated on gender as you would expect, but didn&#x27;t separate on age, or other needs.<p>When I landed on the street I was frightened, crushingly shy, a victim all the way through. A hostel was a brutal experience, horrifying to me in those early weeks on the street in ways that sleeping under bushes, on industrial estates and on building sites just wasn&#x27;t.<p>I had a different set of problems outside, namely the weather, shelter and warmth. But what I had with some planning was a sense of security, a sense that my possessions and myself were safe. That the very worst that could happen would just be to be moved on.<p>Those were things I felt were in my control. I felt safer on the street.<p>I should note that I didn&#x27;t spend every night of 2.5 years sleeping rough. I was young, and learned fairly quickly to seek out Universities, find the student union bar, arrive late afternoon and read a book, and then wait for people to arrive so that I could chat to people. From there the opportunities opened up, and there was a good chance that if I overcome shyness, didn&#x27;t scare them with the state of me, and everything was cool, that for one night there was going to be a bed, a shower, and some toast. I became quite good at this, but never stayed in a city more than a couple of nights before hitching elsewhere so that I never overstayed a welcome and doing this meant I could have a few nights a week on a sofa of someone my age who had a kind heart.",1449698087

In this case, it&#x27;s like flipping a coin (just the odds are not 50/50). Voting on HN is far from deterministic and it&#x27;s often the case that a link gets no traction on the first couple of submissions and then gets on the frontpage the third time it&#x27;s submitted. So, yes, quite a bit of luck is involved.<p>In case of priceonomics, they are writing good content consistently so it&#x27;s hardly luck anymore. If you have 20% (or any other probability) to make the front page and do it often enough, eventually it will happen. And if you keep doing that, people will recognize your domain and more people will click on the link, etc. While chance is still involved, it&#x27;s quite far from the typical definition of &#x27;luck&#x27;.",1449697280

Does the Go compiler check that you check the second return value from a method before doing something with the first return value? I thought you could just ignore the error return and pass along the returned value (which might be nil) as you please. If there&#x27;s compiler support for avoiding nil propagation, that&#x27;s great!<p>In the case of a container type like I&#x27;m suggesting, you get the compile-time checking from the type system – an error return value is not of the same type as the underlying type, so you have to explicitly get the underlying value out.

The government of the day offered huge cash prizes to anyone who could make a chronometer that would reliably work at sea and technologists rose to the challenge.<p>Britain did indeed benefit from a variety of other technological developments, but they basically deployed their blue water navy and colonial efforts in much the same way that the Romans did in the Mediterranean sea centuries before - and the success of Roman and Hellenic civilizations is easily observed in the ubiquity of Latin and Greek roots in the variety of European languages, and our ongoing use of the Latin alphabet. If the Roman empire had not collapsed in the 4th century (for reasons which are beyond the scope of this discussion) most of the world would be speaking Latin today. As with English, Latin thrived because the Romans were fairly skilled administrators of the territories they took over, prioritizing trade and economic growth rather than conquest and total destruction/<p>Latin and Greek are distinctive languages because they have a fully phonetic alphabet, whereas many other writing systems struggle with notating foreign languages. Ancient Hebrew, for example, derived from Phoenician writing and is based on the writing of consonant sounds and so it retains a strong oral tradition of Torah study because there are no letters for vowels and so the meaning of a given word in Hebrew depends heavily on context, substantially limiting its use by others lacking that oral tradition. The utility of an easy-to-learn alphabet should not be underestimated; look at the time cost involved in developing an adequate vocabulary in Chinese or some other ideogrammatic language. Japanese uses Chinese symbols as <i>kanji</i> (albeit with different meanings from Chinese, though Japanese schoolchildren learn both meanings) and has not one but two phonetic scripts, one for Japanese words (to help kids look up <i>kanji</i> in syllabic dictionaries) and one for foreign words. Oddly, though, Japan doesn&#x27;t have a punning tradition based on homophony because the syllabic script came along much later.<p>I apologize for the extreme over-simplifications above, but this is really a book-length topic that can&#x27;t be properly argued in only a few paragraphs.",1449696788

Esperanto is a big disappointment to anyone who knows multiple languages and knows linguistics well.

And, alas, Esperanto has sucked all the oxygen out of the room for any more serious proposal for a constructed languages to serve as an international auxiliary language.<p>The simple fact of the matter is that the international auxiliary language of the twenty-first century is English. New speakers of English added to the total for English each year by learning English as a second language strictly outnumber all Esperanto speakers combined. I have seen English used for that purpose in dozens of combinations of speakers of differing native languages. I have seen rather extensive use of English even for conversation among Chinese people with a certain level of education. (Although the younger generation in China is gradually becoming quite proficient in standard Mandarin in urban areas, Chinese people as old as I am or older sometimes find one another&#x27;s Mandarin acquired as a second language more baffling than one another&#x27;s English similarly acquired.)

There&#x27;s a long trend of pulling in the ideas from functional languages that have proven to be generally useful, like lodash / Java 8 Streams style collections functions, while ignoring the stuff that might be useful but is harder to implement or work with, like purity, immutability, laziness, or sophisticated type inference schemes. Go is definitely anachronistic in not following this particular trend. Of course, that&#x27;s the prerogative of its designers!

On \n  perhaps two of them there would be pretty general \n  agreement, but at least four others are acutely \n  controversial. Here are my own eleven rules, every one of \n  which I regard as golden:\n  \n  • First of all, one should use Indian or Ceylonese tea. \n  China tea has virtues which are not to be despised \n  nowadays — it is economical, and one can drink it without \n  milk — but there is not much stimulation in it. One does \n  not feel wiser, braver or more optimistic after drinking \n  it. Anyone who has used that comforting phrase &#x27;a nice \n  cup of tea&#x27; invariably means Indian tea. \n  \n  • Secondly, tea should be made in small quantities — that \n  is, in a teapot. Tea out of an urn is always tasteless, \n  while army tea, made in a cauldron, tastes of grease and \n  whitewash. The teapot should be made of china or \n  earthenware. Silver or Britanniaware teapots produce \n  inferior tea and enamel pots are worse; though curiously \n  enough a pewter teapot (a rarity nowadays) is not so bad. \n\n  • Thirdly, the pot should be warmed beforehand. This is \n  better done by placing it on the hob than by the usual \n  method of swilling it out with hot water.\n\n  • Fourthly, the tea should be strong. For a pot holding a \n  quart, if you are going to fill it nearly to the brim, \n  six heaped teaspoons would be about right. In a time of \n  rationing, this is not an idea that can be realized on \n  every day of the week, but I maintain that one strong cup \n  of tea is better than twenty weak ones. All true tea \n  lovers not only like their tea strong, but like it a \n  little stronger with each year that passes — a fact which \n  is recognized in the extra ration issued to old-age \n  pensioners. \n\n  • Fifthly, the tea should be put straight into the pot. \n  No strainers, muslin bags or other devices to imprison \n  the tea. In some countries teapots are fitted with little \n  dangling baskets under the spout to catch the stray \n  leaves, which are supposed to be harmful. Actually one \n  can swallow tea-leaves in considerable quantities without \n  ill effect, and if the tea is not loose in the pot it \n  never infuses properly. \n\n  • Sixthly, one should take the teapot to the kettle and \n  not the other way about. The water should be actually \n  boiling at the moment of impact, which means that one \n  should keep it on the flame while one pours. Some people \n  add that one should only use water that has been freshly \n  brought to the boil, but I have never noticed that it \n  makes any difference. \n\n  • Seventhly, after making the tea, one should stir it, or \n  better, give the pot a good shake, afterwards allowing \n  the leaves to settle. \n  \n  • Eighthly, one should drink out of a good breakfast cup \n  — that is, the cylindrical type of cup, not the flat, \n  shallow type. The breakfast cup holds more, and with the \n  other kind one&#x27;s tea is always half cold before one has \n  well started on it. \n  \n  • Ninthly, one should pour the cream off the milk before \n  using it for tea. Milk that is too creamy always gives \n  tea a sickly taste. \n\n  • Tenthly, one should pour tea into the cup first. This \n  is one of the most controversial points of all; indeed in \n  every family in Britain there are probably two schools of \n  thought on the subject. The milk-first school can bring \n  forward some fairly strong arguments, but I maintain that \n  my own argument is unanswerable. This is that, by putting \n  the tea in first and stirring as one pours, one can \n  exactly regulate the amount of milk whereas one is liable \n  to put in too much milk if one does it the other way \n  round. \n\n  • Lastly, tea — unless one is drinking it in the Russian \n  style — should be drunk without sugar. I know very well \n  that I am in a minority here. But still, how can you call \n  yourself a true tealover if you destroy the flavour of \n  your tea by putting sugar in it? It would be equally \n  reasonable to put in pepper or salt. Tea is meant to be \n  bitter, just as beer is meant to be bitter. If you   \n  sweeten it, you are no longer tasting the tea, you are \n  merely tasting the sugar; you could make a very similar \n  drink by dissolving sugar in plain hot water.\n  \n   Some people would answer that they don&#x27;t like tea in \n  itself, that they only drink it in order to be warmed and \n  stimulated, and they need sugar to take the taste away. \n  To those misguided people I would say: Try drinking tea \n  without sugar for, say, a fortnight and it is very \n  unlikely that you will ever want to ruin your tea by \n  sweetening it again. \n  \n  \n  These are not the only controversial points to arise in \n  connexion with tea drinking, but they are sufficient to \n  show how subtilized the whole business has become. There \n  is also the mysterious social etiquette surrounding the \n  teapot (why is it considered vulgar to drink out of your \n  saucer, for instance?) and much might be written about \n  the subsidiary uses of tealeaves, such as telling \n  fortunes, predicting the arrival of visitors, feeding \n  rabbits, healing burns and sweeping the carpet. It is \n  worth paying attention to such details as warming the pot \n  and using water that is really boiling, so as to make \n  quite sure of wringing out of one&#x27;s ration the twenty \n  good, strong cups of that two ounces, properly handled, \n  ought to represent.</code></pre>",1449695848

But gradually, after hitting the front page of Hacker News, the post got in front of the right people. An industry blog called Skift, which focuses on travel technology, wrote about it. Larger blogs like Lifehacker, Gizmodo, and GigaOm wrote about it. Then the big guys started covering it: CNBC, The Financial Times, TIME, Businessweek, and The Huffington Post all wrote about our study and gave a nod to Priceonomics.</i><p>There are several examples of Hacker News providing an early boost to Priceonomics, after a blog post floated to the top and a journalist (or several) noticed. The inbound links helped them vault to the top of Google SERPs for certain terms, and they were able to build a business around helping other companies do the same thing--getting inbound links (and social shares) by publishing unique information.<p>They give a few examples, such as this one:<p><i>This same strategy can be applied to any industry. Say you own an ice cream shop. You know how many ice cream cones you sell per day. You can also look up the average temperature of each day. Create a chart with temperature on the x-axis and ice cream cone sales on the y-axis, and you’ve got excellent, data driven content.</i><p>Another content marketing tactic: Use stories:<p><i>One of the core tenets at Priceonomics is that everyone has an interesting story. Every person you come into contact with on a daily basis has a deep-rooted story about heartbreak, triumph, tragedy, or comedy.</i><p>The part about all of this that I find a little hard to swallow is the connection between publishing interesting data and stories and getting major online news sites and MSM to cover it. One of the examples mentions sending out an email to 50 Apple blogs about a Priceonomics blog post on depreciation of old iPhones, and no one responded. Then they contacted Josh at TechCrunch, who had covered Priceonomics launching a month before, and he wrote it up, with scads of follow-on coverage coming soon after. I think practically anyone else publishing the same bit of information would have been ignored.<p>To me, this suggests that luck, media connections, and submitting the right link to HN at the right time are key factors in early content marketing success. For organizations that don&#x27;t have these benefits/skills, how much will the Priceonomics content marketing formula help them?",1449695188

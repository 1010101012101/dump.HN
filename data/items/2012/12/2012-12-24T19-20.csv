4963904,comment,4962849,4963074,4,0,aphyr,,,"You're right to be concerned about complexity: simple things are easy to understand, easy to predict, and easy to change.<p>That said, I think you'll find many of the ideas in Riemann to be radically simple. The config file is just a Clojure program. Streams are just functions that take events. Events are just maps of keys to values. Everything is an event: there is no concept of a first-class host or service, no need to update the config when you add a host, and no poller loops.<p>Riemann tries to draw strong boundaries between the different layers of monitoring. It speaks a simple network protocol and interoperates with other systems for event collection, visualization, alerting, and storage, instead of building in those systems. In many ways Riemann is defined not by what it includes, but by what it leaves out.<p>That said, there's a lot of work required to make simple abstractions behave correctly, especially around IO and error handling. Wherever possible I try to draw clear internal boundaries to isolate this complexity, but it's still there. If you have specific complaints about code or interfaces which seem too complex to you, I'd be happy to try and explain or change them.",1356379122

If the post you replied to is correct, the dropbox software performed an action it should never perform - deleting files the user did not tell the OS to delete. What's more, every dropbox plan I'm aware of keeps deleted files for 30 days, so if it wasn't possible to recover some of the files, dropbox failed not once but twice.<p>It's all very well blaming the user for not having multiple redundant backups, but that doesn't change the fact that deleting user data without explicitly being told to do so is one of the most egregious sins software can commit.

4963878,comment,4962849,4963217,5,0,aphyr,,,"I'd like to add to this: Riemann is more opinionated than Esper. While you can use it as a general event processing system, it makes some assumptions about event structure which are geared towards application 
monitoring. For instance, Riemann events have a fixed schema with fields like 'host'. You can treat them as open maps and add arbitrary kv pairs in your streams, but that extra information won't necessarily be serialized to fixed-schema formats like the protocol buffers interface.<p>Riemann is also more <i>general</i> than Esper, in that you can define arbitrary operations on events. It sacrifices having an up-front query language in favor of composable functions with stateful side effects. If you want to write a stream that restarts an EC2 instance on failure, it'll be a composable first-class citizen and you can write it right in the config file. Same goes for a stream that pulls in, say, parallel colt to do some heavy statistical lifting. On the other hand, Riemann doesn't include the full range of Esper queries as builtin streams yet, and the ones that are there haven't been optimized to the same degree.<p>Hope this helps clarify things. :)",1356378428

You don't want to buy it because it's priced at its value. Yes, you would have a good ROI if you held it, but the ad revenue isn't guaranteed, you have transaction costs, annual costs, etc.<p>If you know you can double the ad revenue to $4k by changing to another provider or using a proven method of placement, then it's worth $4k to you. If the seller is still offering $2k, then you have a good deal and you should buy. If the seller realizes this and raises the price, then you have to decide how much beneath $4k you need to go to make it worthwhile for you.<p>If you want to build a business on the domain, then you're pricing the value of each visitor. Let's say each visitor brings on average half a cent in revenue: 400,000 visitors brings $2,000. How well will your business convert these visitors? Say you can convince .05% of them to purchase software at an average lifetime value of $100 -- that's $20,000 per year in revenue. Of course you'll need to build a sales site and the product itself. If that takes $15,000, then the domain is worth about $5,000.

Dropbox is not an extension of your mission-critical local storage and backup.<p>My approach for Dropbox on both Windows and OSX is to have the Dropbox folder on a drive that will never see development work, even if that means creating a separate partition for it.  In most cases the system drive works fine (you do have separate system and data drives on your machines, right?).<p>This forces a COPY operation rather than a file MOVE if you drag-and-drop files into any Dropbox folder.  Which means that everything in the Dropbox folder could be trashed tomorrow and nothing whatsoever would be lost.<p>On Windows you can also do this by dragging files while holding down the RMB and on OSX while holding down the Option key.  This, however, is fraught with issues because it is easy to forget and move something in or out of Dropbox accidentally.<p>In addition to that, daily system and data backups to external media on EVERY SYSTEM in the office ensures that even if you took a sledge-hammer to any given machine all the data could be recovered to within a 24 hour boundary.<p>So, no, this is NOT a ""Dropbox horror story"" as far as I am concerned.  At best this is an unfortunate ""pilot error"" and at worst this is a sign of incompetence.<p>Sorry, a little harsh there, but, as a student, I lost six months of heavy coding work once in college.  That really hurt.  And that was probably the best time and place to learn that lesson. That is all it took for me to be completely insane about having backups of backups on anything important.  Now, may years later, you will not find any critical system in my office that is not backed-up at least once  and usually twice.<p>These days there's almost no excuse for loosing your work.  Don't go around blaming Dropbox, not their problem.<p>I am not associated with Dropbox in any way other than being just another user.<p>FEATURE REQUEST: It would be very nice if Dropbox client software could have an option to auto-magically COPY files in and out of Dropbox rather than allowing any files to be moved.  The above-mentioned hack works fine but it'd be nice to not have to use it. Also, I'd venture to guess that most Dropbox users don't do this, which opens them to unintended loss.",1356377490

Maybe you can explain a little further. I am thinking about something like this:<p><pre><code>    git add .
    git commit -am ""Account state prior to joining teams""
    
    git branch personal
    git branch team_x
    git branch team_y

    git commit -am ""Did some more work for team_y""
    
    git checkout personal
    git commit -am ""Added Dad folder for xmas pictures""
</code></pre>
When someone leaves a team:<p><pre><code>    git branch -D team_x
    git branch -D team_y
    </code></pre>
Obviously merging branches would not be allowed.<p>In other words, I am thinking that most of the heavy lifting required to manage the on-boarding and off-boarding of someone from teams, even multiple teams, is already done for your in the form of Git.  Wrap it with some business-specific code and it could be really slick.  Of course, that alone could be a six month project.<p>Anyhow, just seat-of-the-pants without much thought applied to it.

Each time following the test I read a few pages in the book about INTP as well as a few pages on each of the archetypes on which I was judged not to be. Generally I regard personality tests with enormous skepticism but in the case of MB I must confess I was impressed with how accurate the INTP profile described my world view. More importantly, I found no such positive correlation between how my mind works and the other profile descriptions.<p>If the test is worthless, as the author of this article suggests, how would he explain people like me who upon reading the profile for their archetype in the book attest ""yes that is a shockingly accurate description of me"" and upon reading others' profiles react ""no absolutely nothing about that resonates with me""? My own view is that MB, while hardly perfect, is surprisingly revealing for many individuals and can help one understand and be more tolerant of people whose profiles are in sharp contrast to one's own.<p>That said, I have taken other personality tests which highly intelligent people have recommended to me and found absolutely no value in those results.

I prefer taking people at face value and gradually forming an opinion as to who they are while consciously dissociating the superficial characteristics. This is not an easy task and something I work very hard to do (and often fail).<p>( This is mainly because I was born and have lived in quite a few countries which were very different from the region that my race originates from: I have found that people take a shortcut to judging others which always annoys me. Some do it based on race, e.g. You are Ashkenazi jewish, you must be so smart. Others based on superficial personality traits observed in biased environments: You look so vibrant and love to talk, you clearly are an extrovert. )<p>I suspect the evolutionary advantage of having these short cuts is that it helps you size up a situation really quickly. However, in this rapidly changing world of ours, I find this to be a hindrance. People rarely are unidimensional and have significant personality shifts depending on who they interact with or who they talk to. E.g. I was working with a potential advisor back in School who is known to be a paranoid insecure tyrant who is incredibly sarcastic and mean to his grad. students. On the other hand, this person has been in a committed, long term relationship with his significant other, brought up kids in what could be described as the most gentle patient person.<p>( I realize that we are both trading anecdotes here but I tried looking for hard science to back this up a few years back and all I found were speculations.)",1356375790

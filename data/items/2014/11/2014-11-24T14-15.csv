The OP raises a couple of good points (in particular his &quot;The Bad Parts&quot; are mostly valid), but I cannot understand some others, nor do I share his take away.<p>AngularJS is not a silver bullet or panacea. It has bad parts such as the directives API (making it hard to create reusable components), the global namespacing in the injector, and indeed, the number of watch expressions is an issue.<p>That being said, internally at Google:<p>- we do have well working, shared, reusable UI components based on directives. So it&#x27;s quite possible to write usable AngularJS modules.<p>- There are multiple old (>3 years), large AngularJS apps that do not seem to have major maintenance issues. Maintenance of large code bases (>100k SLOC JS) is always an issue, but if you follow the style guide [0] at least it doesn&#x27;t seem worse than with other JS frameworks<p>- Code is minified and compiled, using Closure Compiler&#x27;s @ngInject and @export annotations as required.<p>OP&#x27;s comments mostly sound like they were burned by not following software development best practices (e.g. throw the prototype away, make sure to properly design your domain model, have a qualified tech lead, have qualified engineers).<p>His &quot;Lessons for framework (and metaframework) developers&quot; seem generally useful, but unrelated to particular AngularJS shortcomings.<p>[0] <a href=""http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/angularjs-google-style.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/angularjs-...</a>",1416841015

8652598,comment,8648587,8648587,0,0,diafygi,,,"This does make sense and is backwards compatible, though what about HTML messages? Will you add the simple to/from clutter to the top of the html content, too?<p>Instead of trying to extend the standard, why not just nest an unencrypted email in an encrypted email? I&#x27;m thinking along the lines of:<p>1. Someone writes their message into the client and attaches some files.<p>2. The client generates an unencrypted, standard multi-part email message as message.eml.<p>3. The client then pgp encrypts message.eml to message.eml.pgp.<p>4. The client then generates a new email with message.eml.gpg as an attachment and sends it.<p>5. The recipient receives the message and sees one attachment message.eml.gpg.<p>Most native clients can open arbitrary .eml files as email messages. This makes it much more convenient to interact (reply/forward/etc.) with this technique, and it is also HTML message compatible. Also, if you have a PGP plugin for your native client, it would decrypt the attachment, and you could just double click it to open that message to read/reply/forward/etc.<p>As far as web clients, most can&#x27;t decrypt pgp messages so you&#x27;d have to download the message.eml.pgp. And I guess you&#x27;d also have to have something that can read .eml files. However, it should be fairly easy for pgp-enabled web clients like Mailpile to open these messages since they have to already have a message format parser.<p>Anyway, thanks for the article!",1416840773

8652596,comment,8649465,8649465,0,0,signalsmith,,,"As a mathematician, that article was a little embarrassing to wade through.<p>While there are valid criticisms of the way statistics are sometimes misused in science, pretty much every one of them comes from lack of understanding about how statistical models work - scientists reaching for a familiar test and following a formula they were taught.  I can&#x27;t blame them too much - understanding the true purpose and nature of statistical models is HARD (my recommended step one: become a Bayesian).  What we need is for more people to recognise when they don&#x27;t have that understanding and work with somebody who does.<p>What Briggs seems to have done, though, is decided that because <i>HE</i> doesn&#x27;t understand statistical inference and modelling, that statistics are bunk.  Taking a simplistic definition of &quot;trend&quot; like &quot;the second-half average is higher than the first&quot; and turning that into a boolean yes/no answer is the statistical equivalent of being an anti-vaccer.<p>The most frustrating thing, though, is that all the alternative definitions of &quot;trend&quot; he defines can actually be expressed as statistical models!  The issue is that when you express these definitions/tests for &quot;trend&quot; as models, you see that the statements each model makes about the underlying system are very problematic.<p>TL;DR - Briggs doesn&#x27;t understand statistical modelling, and has therefore concluded that his home-rolled tests are just as good.",1416840765

8652566,comment,8651641,8651641,0,0,jhpriestley,,,"I find the rise of Angular kind of baffling.<p>Angular&#x27;s scope system is exactly analogous to the scope system of a programming language. This is a solved problem! When you make a scope system, make it lexical, and require explicit declaration before use. If you&#x27;re not making those choices, then at least acknowledge that these are the standard answers, with very clear advantages over other scoping systems, and explain why you are not using these answers. But with angular, we have a dynamic, implicit declaration scoping system. New scopes are introduced somewhat unpredictably, at the discretion of each directive. I thought that introducing dynamic, implicit-declaration, non-block-scoped variables in 2014 was like introducing a new car with a coal-burning engine, but no one even seems to remark on it.<p>Then there&#x27;s the dirty-checking loop. After every event there is a digest; every digest runs every watch. To me, just reading this description makes a voice speak up in my head: &quot;Uh-oh! That sounds like O(n^2)!&quot; Now that angular is being widely used, people are noticing that it&#x27;s slow as shit. But why did the framework get to this level without anyone remarking, &quot;this dirty-checking algorithm is fundamentally, irremediably not scalable&quot;? Do people not have a sense even for the most coarse performance characteristics of algorithms like this? Or do people simply think that nowadays &quot;performance does not matter&quot;?<p>Angular&#x27;s &quot;module&quot; system is the strangest of all. It doesn&#x27;t do namespacing or dependency tracking. What is even the point of it? What thought process led to this useless module system?<p>It&#x27;s just strange. Hundreds of years of people&#x27;s work are spent on something, which the most cursory, CS 101 analysis shows to be seriously flawed. Is analysis simply a lost art in this industry?<p>Oh well, people are finally realizing Angular has its faults, because they&#x27;ve seen them with their own eyes and now they believe them. It would be nice if we could learn from this, and maybe skip the next boondoggle (web components for instance), but I have no hope for it.",1416840414

One of those characteristics, a primary one in fact, is that of convention over configuration; Angular, like Rails, defines specific conventions, which only an expert can safely bypass, and to which non-experts must adhere on pain of having a very bad time.<p>> there are at least 20 books on angularjs that are easy to read to understand the framework properly<p>A prototypical example of the sort of wizard comment about which I spoke earlier.<p>> The big issue[, ]in my opinion[, ]is that one needs to know how [J]avascript works in order to understand how directives work.<p>True of any framework, though; if you don&#x27;t understand the language in which it is built, you are certainly going to be at sea in trying to use it. Angular isn&#x27;t special in this regard.<p>(Also, some notes on English orthographic conventions, for the benefit of someone who may not yet be familiar with them: First, medial and terminal punctuation, such as commas and periods, is invariably followed by a space, as exemplified in this comment.

It should be possible to build interactive and distributed applications from piece parts.&quot;<p>Java has many success stories in this area, starting with the amazing reusability of POJOs (plain old Java objects). I can take Java code from 1996 and <i>almost always</i> compile it and use it now without major refactoring and without having to really look at the internals. I can do it with the API docs only. Beyond POJOs there are many abstraction techniques like beans that have been used to build huge software systems that have stood the test of time, albeit with a bit of clunkiness. But Unix pipes are a bit clunky too.<p>I coded a lot with Java years ago. It&#x27;s been out of vogue for quite some time -- though it&#x27;s still very popular just not trendy. Lately I&#x27;ve been reflecting on some of the pain points of other languages and thinking &quot;wow, Java really did have a <i>lot</i> of things right.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve also been thinking that the JVM is <i>almost</i> an OS, and that it sort of wants to be. There were some efforts in that direction, but none really went anywhere. It&#x27;s not quite perfect, but I feel like it&#x27;s the only thing we&#x27;ve had in the past 30 years that looks like a step toward a post-C/Unix operating system that could really work. I also feel like in the age of many-cores we could do away with problems like GC pauses completely. I could forsee a future many-core box where 2-4 (of 32-64) cores are just almost flat out dedicated to GC, JITing, tracing, optimization, etc. When you&#x27;ve got that many cores you could dedicate a few to the OS and not worry much about it. The benefits would be things like forgetting about manual memory management, etc.<p>Also note that the JVM can run more than Java. Java would just be the &quot;core language&quot; of this hypothetical OS, taking the place of C on Unix.",1416840178

Only in blindfold does he need to remember each configuration with perfect clarity so tiny differences can get very confusing.<p>Anyway, this reminds me of an anecdote I read long ago in a Tim Krabbe piece:<p>&quot;A grandmaster once played a 10-board blind simul somewhere. Knowing the ropes of blind simuls, he varied his games right from the start, maybe opening two with 1.e4, two with 1.d4, one with 1.b3, and so on. To his suprise, all of his opponents played 1...b6. On the second move, five of them played 2...Bb7, and the other five 2...Ba6. On the third, three of the five players who had played 2...Bb7 now played 3...Bc8 and the other two played 3...Ba6, while three of the five who had played 2...Ba6 now played 3...Bb7, and the other two 3...Bc8. On move 4, the grandmaster saw bishops everywhere. After move 5, he excused himself and went to the toilet where he was happy to find a window big enough to let him through.&quot;",1416838814

While living, instead of worrying about meeting your needs for present gratification AND productivity of an action, you usually only have to think about the second, because you know you&#x27;ll be fine, and even happy, regardless of the &quot;fun&quot; of the action you choose, as long as the action seems rewarding in the long run.<p>This is easier said than done, but I&#x27;ve found some success in being content in the present through reading up on both mindfulness practices and Stoicism. A lot of people have found success through mindfulness meditation specifically (so check that out), but I&#x27;ve found it more useful for me to mindfully and meditatively carry out mundane tasks, such as dishes, instead of sitting meditation.",1416837854

The encapsulation and dependency injection is perfect way to allow you to be as structured or unstructured as you want / need to be.<p>I can understand how someone coming from more traditional frameworks, and working in an environment where you are rarely or never required to think outside the box, will have difficulty making the transition.<p>Where I personally think Angular could be better (yet was state-of-the-art when it originally came out) is with directives.  Now, I&#x27;m not talking about run-of-the-mill directives that are easy, that implement relatively straightforward concepts.  I&#x27;m talking about highly complex functionality that you want to encapsulate into a single &quot;thing&quot; in your code.  I think Polymer is going to fill that gap.  That being said, Angular team has already (if it hasn&#x27;t changed) decided they&#x27;re going to be moving forward with Polymer.<p>Personally I think Angular + Polymer is going to be hard combination to beat.",1416837823

Before I read &quot;The Humanure Handbook&quot; I thought the very idea was some kind of awful hippie bullshit. However now I have realized something that is really obvious when you try it:<p>Some machines and designs have been perfected for centuries. The toilet however is not one of them! Because it took us so long to discover how germs make us sick, our toilets were really horrible things.<p>In fact, it has taken us so long to understand sanitation, composting, and the environmental impact of using fresh-water flushing toilets, that the entire human race has become used to an activity (flushing toilets) that is astoundingly wasteful (you&#x27;re not only wasting drinking water, but you&#x27;re wasting excellent nutrients in your own shit which is then lost to sewage sludge, which itself takes huge resources to purify)<p>The thing is, you can totally recycle all human (and food) waste without much of an inconvenience and really no smell at all. Yes, let me repeat that - no smell at all. You crap in a bucket of sawdust, cover it completely with more sawdust, and the bucket <i>does not smell</i>.<p>The fact that our civilization has taught itself that flushing our shit away with drinking water is &quot;the right thing to do&quot; is really very troubling and wrong once you realize the <i>vast</i> resources that could be saved by some very, very basic stuff like sawdust toilets and composting.<p>I am aware that achieving this on an urban scale would be a challenge, but it can certainly be solved.....",1416837762

For thousands of years, governments were not run by or for bankers, except on the rare occasions when they were.  In fact, bankers were often lynched and run out of whole territories whenever governments or even the masses could not pay their debts -- the state power was held by those with lands and armies rather than by money-lenders.<p>If you cannot be bothered to examine today&#x27;s situation in its particulars, you won&#x27;t come up with workable solutions.<p>For my own position: definancialization of the broader economy would go a long way to breaking banks from the state.",1416837690

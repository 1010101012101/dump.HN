I've always liked their approach to many issues--follow the money is always good advice in journalism.<p>But this is a case where not only did they ignore the substantive details of the press event (Diamandis and Anderson made clear the economic case was based more on in-space use of extracted resources and the birth on Earth of new industrial techniques using once-scarce platinum group metals, and Lewicki explained in sufficient detail how they would achieve order-of-magnitude cost adjustments compared with the NASA model), but they also made truly juvenile mistakes in their economic analysis:<p>About $4 billion per year is spent on platinum for industrial uses. So if you're sitting on a mountain of platinum you can hope for $4bn/yr revenue for a larger amount of platinum at lower cost (given that's how much industry is willing to spend on the metal), or realistically a value lower or higher based on the the expected demand response to price. Platinum is primarily used in the auto industry, jewelry, and electronics. General motors is not going to sell more product because catalytic converters cost a few hundred dollars less, but jewelers might and the electronics industry certainly would. Either way, approx $4 billion per annum is nothing to sneeze at, and only one part of their revenue model.<p>This is an industry I know <i>a lot</i> about, which makes me wonder how accurate their journalism is in other areas where I usually just take their word...",1335552997

If they know all C++ trivia, but lack a strong knowledge of either C, or good OO, they can do harm to a code base.<p>However, this isn't to distract from importance of using explicit and copy assignment.

3900525,comment,3898916,3898916,1,0,bspring,,,"To pay a consultant with equity, the company should have an incentive plan.  It'll be called something like 2012 [COMPANY NAME] STOCK PLAN and they'll provide you with a copy.  The plan matters for securities laws reasons.  If they don't have one, it's more their problem than yours, but it'd be nice to know they're doing things legit (because if they're not, it could indicate they're not paying attention to tax issues that impact you - see below).  The company's plan will probably have a few different types of instruments they make awards with.  I'd assume they'd provide you with restricted stock or restricted stock units (RSUs).  The first makes sense if the company has no value, the latter makes sense if they do.  I would not want options or any other instrument that only has value based on the increased value of the company, in this case.<p>It may seem surprising, but hopefully logical, that you become an ""investor"" for securities laws purposes when receiving equity awards.  It won't hurt to think like an investor.  You might ask the company whether they've done any external valuations, and do your own diligence to ascribe some value to the company.  You'll also want to get a sense of what the company's plan is and how/when they anticipate exiting, so you actually get something for that equity.  You can defer to VC's judgment on liquidation concerns if the companies are VC backed, since that trajectory is typically pointed towards an exit.  Ultimately, the value of your share of equity over the time you'll spend working for the company, adjusted for the time-value of money and risk you'll never get to liquidate might help you get out of the current mindset, though maybe it'll often yield the same conclusion.<p>As I mentioned above, there are big tax issues in all of this.  If the company (uses the wrong)/(misuses an) instrument, you can be personally liable for a lot of money, without ever having received any cash to pay the burden.  If you get stock, you've received property for services which constitutes income in the US (IRC Section 83(a)).  If that stock has no value, you're fine, but need to make an 83(b) election if it vests.  If the stock does have value, you need to use an instrument that defers your recognition of income until you have the ability to liquidate (RSUs can do this) or be paid in a combination of equity + cash to offset the tax burden.<p>Hope this helps you decide whether you want to invest in these clients.",1335552261

The smartest guy sees the boss's (or company's) bullshit and is more likely to say something about it. This makes trouble. The smartest guy may be a ""bipolar"" type. The smartest guy, with the mind that needs meat to chew, is more liable to implement things in a clever way than one which average joes will be able to maintain and extend easily. You probably don't want the smartest guy because he probably isn't as good on some other dimensions.<p>What I see in this industry is that we project intelligence onto the people with traits which satisfy our prejudices (typically people with high class/status). Then we filter on this perceived-intelligence with the rationale that we want a company with people who are as smart as possible. The actual effect is at least as much to favor people with high social status and self-promotion ability and physical attractiveness as it is to favor smart people.<p>Hiring processes are irrational not because nobody can ever work out the right processes, but because we work backwards from unexamined pictures of ""the right candidate"" to the processes which will select that candidate.",1335552055

Prototypal inheritance is both simpler and more flexible than classical inheritance, so building the latter on the former is much easier.<p>Another thing: there is nothing fundamentally wrong with coercing types. The only time you have an issue with this is when you combine overloading with coercion. Particularly, JavaScript overloads + and uses it to coerce values, which is just broken. Either overloading on types or coercing types by itself is fine and neither is clearly superior; the problems stem from having <i>both</i>.<p>JavaScript also has a standard and multiple compatible implementations; all the cross-browser issues I know of have to do with the DOM rather than the language itself. On top of this, some of the JavaScript implementations are <i>really</i> fast for a dynamic scripting language.<p>Also, let's not get into Python's many problems and weird semantics.

The popular Peepcode screencast makes a Django'esque `apps` directory and modularizes the granular components of the entire app. Other people make an `app` directory and model the familiar Rails MVC. Some people contain controller logic in the router. Some people export routes from smaller files into app.js under a `//routes` comment. Sometimes the connection to the database is bootstrapped when the server starts in app.js. Sometimes the database is accessed from each model. Sometimes the database is accessed from each route. And you're guaranteed to have to dig into every required file to see how they exposed its API. Did they module.exports the entire object? Or did they individually export each public method?<p>See, I'm not criticizing unopinionated frameworks. They're for people that are opinionated and want to write the code that glues their opinionated structure together. Or for apps small enough to get by without deliberated structure.<p>But in a discussion about productivity, perhaps there's something to be said when people with experience making non-trivial apps have corroborated conventions and practices for a community to share.",1335549763

The minerals/metals they're mining (example: Platinum) are worth 1,500 due to supply and demand. Only a few hundred tons of platinum are mined on earth every year, restricting supply, thus driving the price up. If thousands of tons of platinum were ""imported"" from an asteroid, wouldn't this flood the market with supply and collapse the price?<p>What am I missing here?",1335549754

Also the presence of a real module system, and the fact that the compiler would catch my typos.<p>However, after comparing my two codebases (the original one in Actionscript and the new on in Javascript), I can't help but be amazed at all the damn boilerplate that's in my Actionscript. I ended up spending an enormous amount of time specifying interfaces and careful inheritance chains so that all of my type annotations would be compatible and safe. Did I need to do all that? Probably not, but the design of the language certainly encouraged me to do so. I can't help but wonder what I could have done with that time - especially considering the fact that my JS codebase doesn't seem to have more bugs or worse stability.<p>Would I switch back if I could? I'm not sure.<p>I can't help but think that there's a real opportunity for a Coffeescript-like language with a module system, clean class syntax, and some Go-like features such as Go interfaces and type inference, plus manual type annotations when necessary.",1335549708

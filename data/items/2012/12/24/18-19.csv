4963737,comment,4963350,4963350,1,0,pokesomesmot,,,"Why is something that can be gleaned from a man page a ""trick""?  Boy reads man pages.  News at 11.<p>I agree with agwa.  I only use chroot for building live systems, not ""security"".  And I use su and sh -c sometimes for overcoming braindead attempts at security on Linux distributions.<p>But I have always thought that if you were going to use chroot as some sort of security mechanism (""jails""), then you have to strip all the unneeded functionality out of the environment.  It must all be removed from the system.  If there is a program on the system that can do something you don't want the user to do, then either remove that program or edit the code to remove that functionality (e.g. a reduced functionality shell, etc.) and recompile.<p>Imagine the user uses SSH to login to a machine that only has a crippled shell (you have edited the code to remove undesired functionality) and a couple of other crippled programs that can't do much of anything.  These might be combined into the same binary, similar to busybox.  Any functionality that you don't want the user to have simply does not exist omnn the system.  That would be my idea of ""security"".",1356375446

There are many properties of classes one can consider beneficial, but they might in fact conflict with each other to some extent, especially when carried out to extremes like in this case, so what you want is to find a good compromise. The ""principle"" itself is rather a very fuzzy guideline, so I wish it wouldn't be taught to people since it seems to do more harm than good to their understanding good OO design.<p>On another note, I wonder to what extent Rails usage of the Active Record pattern makes ""models"" so clumsy in large applications.

I'm a Black programmer and the first hurdle I ran into was not having access or understanding the concept of a computer until I HAD to use one. For instance, it was in high school where a guidance counselor told us we should send college applications and provide an email address - thing is - I didn't know what an email address was. I learned typing on a typewriter... I'm 26 years old, I was still learning to set margins and tabs while most of my peers were using typing applications on a computer.<p>My idea of a mouse was the creature that ran to and fro with the roaches in the building we lived in. For the longest, I thought Yahoo.com was the internet lol.<p>Second, we programmers feed off the community we surround ourselves with - hence this forum, hacker meetups etc. But in my neighborhood - it's non existent with the focus being on sports, programs for at-risk youth and countless other interest - not computers or programming. I say MY neighborhood because I can't speak for all - but the trend is highly prevalent throughout all inner city and rural communities.<p>The economic hardship is also a factor. Not having access to a computer goes hand in hand with school district funding, family income etc. Also, programming changes so rapidly, the moment you get your foot in - its easy to get discouraged by your lack of understanding because the technique you just learned gets optimized and becomes the new norm before you master the fundamentals.<p>Saying 1% of this  is the same as in the field is ridiculous. Explain the NFL, NBA, FIFA, NASCAR - does those reflect the population? Some states are reaching out to the inner city to teach them to solve the very problems they face using code - other places are still fine with utilizing the tools already made and have no interest in innovating them.",1356374929

4963694,comment,4961357,4961357,2,0,robomartin,,,"""Aha! moment"".  Well, I have to say that, for me, this came with the practice, not the study, of FSM's and, in particular Turing Machines.  I could not imagine a world without them.  Look around you.<p>While I studied FA formally it never really clicked until years later.  Sometimes you don't really learn until you are holding a cat by the tail.<p>I should say that I've always called them ""FSM"" when, in most cases, in reality I was using a TM.  A TM, of course, is also an FSM, so I'm at peace with my loose use of the term.<p>I really started to use FSM's with great frequency while working on developing hardware with FPGA's.  Everything from reset modules to FIFO and SD/DD RAM controllers and more benefit from FSM's. They greatly reduce complexity and allow you to express very complex logic in code that can actually be followed and understood. For some reason FSM's feel more ""at home"" in hardware rather than software for me (although I use them extensively in software as well).  There's something about looking at the definition of an FSM's states and realizing that it's a bunch of single bits (flip-flops) that makes it real:<p><pre><code>    // Fictitious example\n    parameter STATE_RESET      = 5'b00001;\n    parameter STATE_STOP       = 5'b00010;\n    parameter STATE_FORWARD    = 5'b00100;\n    parameter STATE_TURN_RIGHT = 5'b01000;\n    parameter STATE_TURN_LEFT  = 5'b10000;\n</code></pre>\nLater, when you code the FSM --and if you've been doing this for a while-- you can look at the code and almost literally see the flip-flops and latches forming the structure:<p><pre><code>    always @ (posedge SOME_CLK) begin\n        case(state)\n            STATE_RESET: begin\n                // Do something in this state\n            end\n            STATE_STOP: begin\n                // Do something in this state\n            end\n            STATE_FORWARD: begin\n                // Do something in this state\n            end\n            STATE_TURN_RIGHT: begin\n                // Do something in this state\n            end\n            STATE_TURN_LEFT: begin\n                // Do something in this state\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n</code></pre>\nIt's really cool. Geeking-out just thinking about it.<p>In the software front, everything from communications packet processors to email address validation and menu processors benefit from using FSM's.  I like the application of FSM's to web app controllers where you can encode a lot of knowledge and sophistication into your control module and not end-up with a huge rats-nest of procedural code that is nearly impossible to understand and maintain.<p>I have to admit being guilty of ""thinking like an FSM"" at times to the extent that I see the opportunity to use them in almost every project, hardware or software.<p>Again, today I could not imagine designing hardware or writing software without FSM's.",1356374641

As I said, I'm not a Keynesian. I'm glad you agree that monetary and fiscal stimulus will often be ineffective.<p>If employees want to reduce risk, why would they want sticky wages? Sticky wages <i>increase</i> risk of having your wage cut to $0.<p>I'm also curious - you acknowledge that given higher wages, employees <i>choose</i> to spend the money on consumer goods rather than mitigating their risk. Why would they do this if risk reduction is their primary goal? It seems as if you are incorrect about what people actually want.<p><i>But my theory says that I have less power over the company than they have over me, because I am closer to living out of my car, should my personal decision to quit prove disastrous, than the company is in going bankrupt because they decided to fire me.</i><p>This is true, but irrelevant.

You'd download a ton of archive files, unpack them, then run a binary that would allow you to query things like title, year, actor.  One of the best features from those days (and maybe the very early web-based IMDB) was you could say, ""show me actors that were common to these 2 movies"" (or maybe it was ""given these 2 actors, show me movies they both starred in"" -- or maybe both).<p>I sorely miss those days of a community-driven IMDB.

I remember being terrified of going into the city. Stray rounds regularly found their ways into people's living rooms, and just a block or two from the national mall, one would have been ill-advised to spend any time.<p>I definitely subscribe to the national trends impacting local crime rates. D.C. today, while not an exceptionally nice place to be, isn't comparable to D.C. of the 1980s and 90s.<p>But there are other things that impacted D.C. w/r to very local issues. For example, I don't think it's a stretch to think that the end of Marion Barry's tenure as ""mayor for life"" and the reversal of decades of population flight which started around the time of his first term is all a big coincidence. The drop-off of crack-cocaine as a local drug of choice was also a major contributor.<p>The gentrification that followed, while often viewed in negative terms by many, has resulted in a city with large physical areas of relative safety and good maintenance. The only comparable city I'm aware of is New York, which had a similar dangerous reputation, and is now a pretty nice place to be.<p>Gun crime in D.C. was and is significant. In the interest of being mindful that correlation does not equal causation (gun control up and gun violence down in the same period does not mean that one caused the other), I'd probably argue that there's little evidence that gun control in either direction has had the majority impact on D.C. gun crimes, but that external factors that have contributed to improving the city and have had larger impacts.",1356373905

My response was to shows examples where it does happen in practice and so my simple example could not be rejected out of hand. I don't know what ""almost never"" means for this context. In practice, companies almost never forget to pay overtime to salaried workers. Companies almost never hire child labor. Both are illegal, even though they almost never happen.<p>""there is nothing preventing Hostess employees from finding alternate employment except the fact that Hostess still pays them more than their next best alternative""<p>And your point is that it's moral for Hostess to keep cutting wages until people start leaving for other positions?<p>My argument is all about morality, not economics. How morality is carried out must acknowledge the economics, but economics does not dictate the morality. I argue that there is a cultural expectation that salaries will rarely decrease, and that expectation is part of the cultural morality. The culture expectation exists, because people get a job in part to reduce risk. Otherwise we would all be contractors, and demand a higher income in order to handle the higher risk exposure. But there's a cultural difference in what it means to be an employee and what it means to be a contractor. Perhaps the distinction is that employees also trade loyalty for security, where contractors only trade services for money. I've not thought so deeply about that distinction.<p>""If your theories about employer monopsony power had any relation to the real world, then we would simply not observe wage stickiness.""<p>You cannot make the observation ""we would simply not observe wage stickiness"" and conclude there is a lack of employer monopsony power. You have to show that there are no other reasons which can counteract that effect it, even in the face of monopsony.<p>Other factors may dominate. As an example, suppose a commandment in the Bible were 'employers shall not reduce the wages of their employees.' If the owners of a company followed Christian principles as well as legal ones then you would still observe wage stickiness, despite the lack of a law to that effect. Even if the employees were all non-Christian and don't care about that law per se, and wouldn't protest if the employer didn't follow that religious law.<p>As a more real-world example, you can't look at Chik-Fil-A and conclude that there's no market for fast-food chicken on Sundays, or that people won't work on Sundays for fast-food chicken stores.<p>Researching this now, I am expressing basic aspects of the search and matching model. ""Jobs in the Search and Matching model are characterized by monopoly rents, due to the matching frictions that give rise to search costs and unemployment,"" says <a href=""http://personal.lse.ac.uk/pissarid/papers/WB_ECMA.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://personal.lse.ac.uk/pissarid/papers/WB_ECMA.pdf</a> .<p>I see that my morality issue is described as a ""wage norm"" in <a href=""http://www.tau.ac.il/~yashiv/kl_jme2007.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tau.ac.il/~yashiv/kl_jme2007.pdf</a> , starting with ""We employ a version of Halls (2005) notion of a wage norm to introduce real wage rigidity. A wage norm may arise from social convention that constrains wage adjustment for existing and newly hired workers.""<p>I tried to understand their conclusion. It starts off ""In a baseline New Keynesian model, labor market frictions render real wage rigidity potentially irrelevant for the dynamics of inflation."" and continues ""As one component of real marginal costs, wages, becomes less volatile, the other component, hiring and job creation costs, becomes more volatile. The mechanism emphasized by Hall (2005) and Shimer (2005) that helps the search and matching model fit the facts, appears to have a neutralizing effect in sticky price models.""<p>I read the first part as saying that the baseline New Keynesian model isn't affected by real rage rigidity (but you disagree and say it is, correct?) If my interpretation is correct, then this is an area where non-market forces, like wage norms, can be a stronger influence because they don't directly affect the success or failure of the company.<p>I read the second as saying that the main effect of wage rigidity is the volatility in hiring and job creation costs. How either the dynamics of inflation or the volatility of hiring and job creation costs affects the unemployment level is beyond my understanding, but from what I understand of the paper suggests that what you see as clear evidence - wage stickiness - does not necessarily imply a lack of monopoly.<p>""But applying it to drivers, machine operators and burger flippers is silly.""<p>I never said it applied to all employees. I say that employment is sometimes not fungible. You seem to both agree (as for an algebraic topologist) and disagree (""there is nothing preventing Hostess employees from finding alternate employment except the fact that Hostess still pays them more than their next best alternative"").<p>When something isn't fungible, then its scarcity affects its price. You can hardly say that that's surprising. In that case, it's easy for an employer (or, yes, employee) to abuse the advantage. The employer's best alternative to giving in to a demand is to fire the person. The likelihood of the company going out of business while it finds a replacement is low. The employee's best alternative to giving in to a demand is to quit. The likelihood of the employee facing tight financial difficulties is higher.<p>""by this logic, walmart has a monopoly on ""low priced goods""""<p>Every time I've said ""monopoly"" in relation to jobs I've said that the issue is not monopoly but abusing monopoly power. Can you make the case that Walmart is both a monopoly <i>and</i> abuses its monopoly powers?<p>Microsoft faced monopoly charges not because it was the only supplier of Microsoft products, and primary supplier for the desktop OSes in the world, but because of claims that it abused its monopoly powers. I think the history of unions shows cases where companies have used abused their employment power, and I think the best model is to say that there is either a monopoly or cartel of employers which made that possible.<p>""if Hostess cuts wages from $40 to $10 and gives up their monopsony power, isn't that a good thing?""<p>No, because it's a risk management thing. People become employees partially to minimize long-term risk. Giving up their monopsony power (by going out of business) increases employee risk.<p>I'm fine with monopoly power so long as it isn't abused. I don't want to force a break-up of Microsoft just because they might abuse their monopoly power, because that breakup could be worse for the employer, the employees, and the customers.<p>A question for you is - do monopolies (or cartels, for that matter) ever abuse their monopoly (or oligopoly) powers? If so, do you use moral guidelines to determine what constitutes abuse?<p>I ask because I've talked to ardent free economy supporters who believe in no restrictions, not even to prevent monopoly abuse. Yes, even to the point of wanting to allow child labor and indentured servants. Because I believe we must use morality to guide where we want economics to take us, if you don't also believe in moral restraints on the market then this conversation will go nowhere.",1356373296

Things that would have forever been locked away in one language can now be read, barely, by everyone. This is something that human translators without the net could never achieve. The costs and latency were just too high to use them.<p>That is what technology does in a nutshell, it takes something that used to belong to the elite and brings it to the masses.",1356372394

4963555,comment,4961357,4961357,2,0,DeepDuh,,,"The concepts themselves have helped me a lot when programming parsers / interpreters / compilers. Recently I've developed a language extension for Fortran 90 along with a parser/analyzer in python that extracts structural information of the the program as well as the additional directives. Solved it in <1000 lines of python by combining an FA like structure (state switch using a dictionary function lookup with a state variable inside a loop) with regular expressions for the individual lines / state transitions. Sure, you could come up with this on your own quite easily, but FA give you some powerful concepts - even just knowing the keywords to google for can save you days of work.<p>The gist: When it comes to computer science and mathematical concepts, don't ask why to study it, just study it - possible applications will probably come at some point later in your career.",1356372129

A core tenet of communism is democratic control over production. There are two main branches of communist philosophy: statist and anti-statist. The anarcho-communists, who are more liberal than any other political philosophy I can think of, would never say that a freedom must be restricted by someone above.<p>""Authoritarian"" is what the author meant. Ironically, capitalism exists to allow for the design of somewhat decentralized, somewhat competitive authoritarian institutions that will control production. What he's describing is more inherently capitalist than communist. He's confused by the fact that the USSR was simply a state-capitalist society just like the US is, only with weaker trust networks.",1356372104

Computers keep getting better over time because of how the industry identifies and fixes issues. An obvious (but not the best) example would be the Macbook power connector. A given system cannot be antifragile (unless it learns on its own), but the evolution of technology can be.

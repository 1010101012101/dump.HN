I know that I hate those menus with greyed out items and no explanation why a certain option is not available at the moment. Not even seeing the option at all might be even more confusing, because then I might start looking everywhere for the option to show up.",1229424338

The desktop and user interface is the ONLY thing joe public users really care about. Ubuntu spends no time on it's menu structures / namings or on the design (which looks awful!).<p>- Their package management is poor. You end up being upgraded by default to the newest releases - which is fine to a point but a) if I want to stay with an older release (I prefer the .04 releases - plus I dont trust this newer kernel) you have to fight it and b) it messes up the upgrade so much, a lot of my .04 rigs now report as .10 incorrectly... they need to fix their package trees and tagging<p>- The user support isn't wonderful. The forums have improved but they are FAR from easy to use (as an experienced forum user I have trouble at times) and the website is far from accessible.<p>Ubuntu has done a good job making a big noise about itself - but it's flashy, showy and gives Linux a bad name... it wont make us mainstream.<p>I keep saying that to go mainstream Linux needs 3 things:
- #1 a dedicated, funded, team to make a decnet stable base distro like Debian but without the huge waits (4month release cycle).<p>- #2 a good UI engineer to take a look at the layouts and designs and change a lot of it<p>- #3 some benefactor millionaire willing to promote and pay/support a distro into the mainstream. I know it is a free product but no one can trust it if there is not <i>some</i> sort of culpability....",1229422378

An experiment like this one should usually run over the course of 50 years, but it will be interesting regardless... Perhaps we will learn something about investor performance, the need to wear a suit to perform well etc. I'm pretty skeptical that investors in a public forum will be able to beat the market over a long period - after all, their investment methods are <i>very</i> visible and will be copied if successful (which will break any model).<p>Machine-readable statistics, lots of users..I've been subconsciously wishing for a site like this for a long time. Even Prosper gave me a lot of new insights about the workings and not workings of finance.",1229421640

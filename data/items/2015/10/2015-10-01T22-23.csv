And if you weren&#x27;t even going to raise one VC round, then at that point you may as well raise exactly one and then signaling is irrelevant. Yes you&#x27;ve diluted yourself 20% and now you&#x27;ve got a board member that wants you to grow fast, but so do you. Of course, I&#x27;m assuming here that you failed to raise on Kickstarter, and you aren&#x27;t making enough $ to hire people to do development/testing/security/evangelism/PR/marketing/operations/etc. anytime soon. Why waste years of your life when you can hand the project off eventually to a community you&#x27;ve built, and move on?

I would actually expect it will have the opposite effect.<p>The fragments already existed. They existed, in part, because it was cheap and easy to freeload on Google&#x27;s SDK.  You could just take it and modify it in incompatible ways and it cost you basically nothing to maintain that.<p>See, for example, the amazon fire stuff, which was already a fragment, which basically used to say &quot;download the google sdk and do this to that&quot;.
Now they can&#x27;t do that.

I&#x27;m the actual person (employee #5!) you&#x27;d be working with, and I&#x27;m looking for someone as driven and passionate about security as I am to come help us make a security product that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> suck.<p>- Who am I -
I built the backend here at ThinAir, but previously I worked on Palantir&#x27;s infosec team, as well as a bunch of open-source stuff (I&#x27;m the current maintainer of the Sulley Fuzzing Framework, I&#x27;ve contributed security fixes to ElasticSearch, as well as a few other things).<p>I love development and information security, so this was a natural marriage of roles for me. I get to build things I want, and change the future of data security at the same time! Groovy.<p>- What we do -
We&#x27;re ThinAir (<a href=""https://thinair.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://thinair.com/</a>), and we&#x27;re changing the (currently awful) data security landscape. We aim to solve the problem of breaches on both the large and small scales, with a good focus on usability from all sides (end user, admins, CSOs, etc). We don&#x27;t believe security products should be a game of &quot;select 2&quot; in the set of {real security, usability, stability}.<p>- What we need -
We&#x27;re looking for 1-2 more django peeps with decent security knowledge to come help me build out new features in our Django backend. Do you like self-documenting APIs and inception-like encrypted encryption keys? You&#x27;re probably who I&#x27;m looking for. Even if you aren&#x27;t exactly writing your own encryption algorithms, I still want to talk to you! Security is a mindset, not a finite set of knowledge.<p>- How to get in touch - 
I&#x27;m not going to make you submit your resume to a website. I just want to talk to you for 10-15 mins.<p>Email me (ryan@thinair.com) and we can arrange a time to talk - either in-person over coffee or over the phone.<p>Be prepared to answer one very simple question - &quot;What was the last cool thing you worked on, and why was it cool?&quot;<p>Cheers!

I don&#x27;t see Google or Apple selling products from anyone but themselves (mostly. Apple does sell a few accessories and Google has some pure editions which they have a hand in). Pick any retailer, and there are brands and products they don&#x27;t sell.<p>I could see it being shady if you were talking about denying people access to things they need, but we&#x27;re talking about selling on the Internet here. It&#x27;s not like people will have a hard time buying Apple TVs or Chromecasts because they aren&#x27;t on Amazon. They just have to type the name into their address bar.<p>I would guess they got a lot of complaints from people who said they couldn&#x27;t get Instant Video to work on their streaming devices, someone calculated the cost of customer service vs profits of selling those devices, and decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it... how is that any different form any other retailer choosing to drop a product because it isn&#x27;t working for them? Customer service costs and returns are probably the most common reason for anyone dropping something.<p>I know Amazon has a bigger selection than pretty much everyone, but does that give them a moral imperative to not discriminate on products? Seems like people are considering Amazon as if they were a public utility, which seems like a pretty impressive achievement for them.",1443737869

There is no difference, really. You&#x27;re just changing the way you write the code.<p>Also, you&#x27;re not forced to choose &quot;await or promises&quot;. You can use both as you see fit, in the same block:<p><pre><code>   async () => { 
      // make 2 requests in parallel
      var p1 = fetchSomething();
      var p2 = fetchAnotherThing();

      // wait for both of them to be done
      await Promise.all(p1, p2);

      // continue when they&#x27;re both resolved      
      // these &quot;await&quot; only get the values since the promises are resolved
      doSomethingWithTheValues(await p1, await p2);
   }
</code></pre>
> But for sync functions we usually let the error terminate the program because if a sync function throws in runtime it means something is wrong in my program, not in networking<p>This is just the way you&#x27;re choosing to see the problem. Promises can be used for anything, it&#x27;s not tied to networking. I usually write promises that will be resolved when a modal window closes or when an application event happens.<p>It&#x27;s just a simpler way to write code. The way you use it is up to you.<p>Also, async/await makes debugging a lot easier. The debugger can understand that the next expression after an &quot;await&quot; is supposed to be in the same function context. No more adding breakpoints to the callback function because only you know how the code is called at runtime. You debug async functions as normal functions.",1443737799

Identical dilemma to that of the worker.<p>The class warfare between owners of capital and workers is essentially the same mechanics but taken between two specially chosen groups. In general, each individual and each group seeks to increase their share relative to others (whether you call it income or capital gains). Costs going down is how we all get richer as a society (the costs including both paychecks and capital gains).",1443737180

3988784,comment,3988515,3988690,17,0,chc,,,"I think you have it the wrong way around. It's not that this topic isn't up for public debate, but rather that the talk was part of a debate that was <i>already</i> highly politicized and TED doesn't want to get into that. Once the politicos see you as a good platform from which to shout their message, you will find yourself swamped by people who just want to yell party lines at each other. If you want to remain independent of party politics, you have to keep those people away.<p>This is also why I'm of the opinion that Internet forums which are not explicitly about politics should explicitly ban most political discussion. Otherwise the loud partisans will eventually drown out everything else. (Remember a few years ago when it came out that there was a huge conservative voting bloc on Digg downvoting anything posted by members they suspected of being liberals, even if it was non-political? You don't want those people around.)<p>This isn't to say that topics one party or another might happen to like better should be off-limits, but that you should be very careful when approaching those topics not to play to the political aspects of the topic. It sounds to me like this is what TED suggests as well.",1337284759

They failed in execution because it appears they don't value their relationship with vendors as evidenced by not letting them impose limits in the number of coupons sold. Mom and Pop restaurants don't scale like startups and many were left with really bad experiences from being ill equipped to deal with a massive influx of customers in a short time frame, and consequently the customers ended up having a bad experience as well. This wasn't universal but it seems to have been frequent enough to have severely tarnished the brand. If Groupon had been better stewards of their relationships with their merchants instead of sacrificing them in the name of growth I don't think anybody would lump them into the ""ponzi scheme"" camp.

3988751,comment,3988519,3988519,6,0,Zarathust,,,"First day value change seems misleading to me. I think it represents the value at which select shareholder can buy the initial shares issued by the company and not the value which they are first traded at the stock market.<p>Consider for example linkedin, which got ""issued"" at around 35$ per share. The first price to hit the stock market was around 70$. This is because the first shares are sold to a select few at the 35$ price so there can be volume at opening. Those people traded the shares at 70 right away.<p>We can conclude at least two things from this :
1-Banks will try to scam companies during IPO by issuing shares lower than market value so that early buyers can pocket instant profit
2-If you are not in the selected few, making big bucks during an IPO is much more difficult than what is represented in this graph",1337284467

It was cool that they were technically full-colour in a 256c screenmode, but apart from that they were just horizontal coloured bars to me :)<p><i>However</i> there was another very useful trick to changing colours wrt sync. Basically you wanted to have all the gfx drawing done before the vertical retrace (which is quite a bit longer than the horizontal one), then flip the buffer (during) so you'd get a flickerless display at full framerate. Now if you'd change palette colour 0 (background, including screen edges) to red right after the flip, and then back to black again after your drawing routines are done and you begin waiting for the vsync again, you got to see the top of your screen's background red, up until some percentage of the screen height.<p>This was basically your performance meter. Code more complex routines and the red area becomes bigger. Add even more calculations, it gets to the bottom of the screen, and when it gets too far you won't be done calculating before the next vsync and your framerate drops to half.<p>Some times I even micro-optimized bits of assembly code by marking the position with pencil on a post-it on the side of the monitor to see if switching around some instructions would make it go up or down a few millimeters :) It really was that stable (given you did exactly the same calculations every frame--which is often the case for demos, but probably not for games). That is, until Windows came along: multitasking meant you were going to miss that vsync every once in a while and the red bar jumping up and down like crazy.",1337284276

The video splitter used since 1994 was produced by the South Korean manufacturer DASH. Since the manufacturer helped Paik with the technical realization of many of his works (including <i>Megatron/Matrix</i> in 1995), it is likely that this device was specially constructed for the installation. By 2008, the devices shutdown function had become problematic, probably a sign of more serious loss of function to come.""<p>You see the same dichotomy between fine-art creators versus conservators, as you see between video game artists and emulator designers: ""whatever works in the moment"" freedom versus obsessive attention to detail.",1337283177

Sending websockets over HTTP on port 80 only has a 67% success rate. HTTPS over 443 had a 95% success rate. The benefit of HTTPS is that intermediates cannot see or interfere with data transfer. The disadvantage is that caching and CDNs are more difficult to use.<p>As an interesting side note, tunneling HTTP over a random port (in the slides port 61985) had a higher success rate than port 80 (86% vs 67%). If I remember correctly, the speakers attribute this to intermediate proxies hardcoded to handle port 80, leaving other ports free of processing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNBkxA313kk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNBkxA313kk</a>",1337282600

Most of the conversations are boring because the arguments that are brought up show a clear lack of understanding and are based on huge incorrect assumptions about the entire world of finance.<p>In general institutional investors are seeing a trend of other institutional investors worried about bubbles.  To me, the contrarian that I am, this says that there is probably no bubble and that the risk of said bubble is way overblown.  The assumption that institutional investors are not intelligent and did not watch the same news you did about the 2001 bubble and housing bubble is a very dangerous assumption to make.<p>My suggestion would be to think a little before jumping to conclusions on this. I do not know whether there is a bubble or not, but assuming one is forming, it hasnt hit external markets yet and is largely captured in the SV echo chamber.  Facebook will be the first big company to IPO from this.  Whether they are a dud or not will have very limited impact on public markets since they make up such a small amount of money compared to the rest of world of finance.<p>If a single investor isnt investing $500m in a single deal, it is relatively a nonissue.  You may want to be worried if you see multibillion dollar investments by single entities.  The top 3 asset managers manage over $5 trillion dollars.  That means that 50 Facebooks could fit in just that number.  That means that Instagram is a rounding error.<p>The world in SV seems big to you, but has yet to even remotely impact the outside world.<p>The big secular trend you should be looking at is the fact that everything will be automated.  Everything.  That will cause job loss for most, but for the hackers here, you can bet there will be a multitude of areas to save big companies and individuals both time and money.

3988578,comment,3986758,3987351,1,0,nieve,,,"Despite your assertion that the ""grandma"" mode of knitting isn't programming and mostly doesn't innovate, that (rather more diverse than assumed) community is responsible for the vast majority of new patterns and often experiments extensively.  I think it's great that more (computer) geeks are getting into fields that have always had a high geek percentage and you can definitely make it a really geeky endeavor, but there's a lot of wheel reinvention and failure to RTFM.  Fun, definitely worth doing as a learning experience, but perhaps we shouldn't be so much with the patting each other on the back and insularity.  For that matter computer geeks aren't even in the running for geekiest approach to knitting - for that you have to go to the heavy math folks.  It's intellectually, visually, and tactilely beautiful stuff.<p>Also you know appear to know little about real world cooking outside of a recent, highly-distorted, and publishing industry-driven world view.  Recipes may list precise ingredient measurements (though most don't), but they're rarely intended to be used as-is and there's huge variation in detail.  Even more so, almost all cuisines are more a collection of common techniques and ingredients than a set of well-defined dishes, with much regional variation, and huge historical change.  Most European-descended Americans and much of Europe use a _tiny_ subset of the ingredients our ancestors did and have completely dropped entire genres of food.  Just take a look at the actual variety of citrus fruits versus what we use and the huge range of uses they were put to.<p>It's like someone decided Java was the only programming language, the standard library was the only library allowed, and btw we needed to get rid of half the syntax!  In that metaphor you're lionizing a couple of programmers for making the jump to Objective-C or C# while somehow overlooking the vast majority of programmers using everything from for decades Perl to ML and mixing things up left and right.  Yeah, a lot of chefs & professional cooks (these are terms of art, not just a fame thing) try new things... and no, they're not even close to the only people doing so.  In fact it's mostly a recent thing that chefs are innovators, for a very long time they were the ones working precisely to recipe.  Consider the formalization of French haute cuisine by Antonin Carme & Georges Escoffier and the subsequent rigid adherence even now.<p>Try learning cooking from a cook - not a book - experimenting for yourself, and reading one of the many books like ""Cookwise"" that actually get into what happens and how to change it.  It's the antithesis of hacking to assume there's nothing to learn and no room for experimenting!",1337282227

The writer made claims about my startup that were completely unfounded and to make matters worse, the blog trashed my b2b partner. It seemed like she was making her bones, and trying to be intentionally provocative to get eyeballs, off my back.<p>What should I do?  Respond or forget about",1337281446

For TV shows, however, I'm much more willing to watch what I consider to be a ""suboptimal"" choice, since its shorter. I think a lot of consumers share my sentiment in this, however I can see how if you watch a lot of movies it would be too expensive with Amazon's offering.",1337281427

3988498,comment,3987465,3988210,2,0,mhartl,,,"You're criticizing my paraphrase of DHH, not my actual point. That point was ""companies with a huge number of users <i>are</i> valuable, either as eventual cash cows or as strategic acquisitions, but at best following that route is a risky strategy."" So you can see that I'm not judging at all: I have no problem with the high valuations of Instagram, Pinterest, etc. Growth companies with millions of users are hugely valuable even if they aren't currently making any money. (This is a point on which DHH and I respectfully disagree.)<p>If you want to follow a high-variance strategy, there's nothing wrong with that. What is wrong is expecting that your new startup has a reasonable chance of being the next Instapintora. If you want to build a sustainable business, lower-variance strategies (which typically aim to become profitable quickly) are a better bet. I dealt with these issues explicitly in a talk I gave at LA RubyConf in 2011, which you can find here: <a href=""http://youtu.be/j0jT98ZXh5M"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/j0jT98ZXh5M</a><p>P.S. My tutorial for an ""aged"" technology is only step 1 in a four-step plan for world domination; steps 2-4 are much higher-variance. Stayed tuned.",1337281264

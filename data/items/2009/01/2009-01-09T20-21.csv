You can split hairs about whether app selection should be figured into UX - I think maybe it should - but that clearly isn't what Scoble means.<p>Being based on HTML and JS does not mean that Pre apps will be served up over HTTP.

Like most students I was taught the Calculus with the rigorous epsilon delta definition of a limit which was then used to define derivatives.

Karma is really a one-dimensional projection of a two-dimensional (at least) characteristic.  People upmod because they agree, or because they think the post is interesting.  This blends two quite different characteristics into one number.

427064,comment,426849,426849,0,0,tstegart,,,"I don't believe un-open source is a concept that can exist under past versions of the GPL. If you read the GPL, it has no time limit on the license. And the contract also has no termination conditions except for one (which the people downloading/modifying the program control).<p>Therefore, it appears an old version GPL license is a neverending license without a way for the original person to end it. So no, he cannot open-source any of it, even his own original work. He can stop distributing it, but since he gave a license to others to distribute it, they can just distribute the original. And unless they break the one term of the license, he cannot stop that.<p>Clearly, this is where you run into the concept of the GPL. It was meant to ensure that original works of software would always be available to use and modify. ""Always available"" are the key words. He is out of luck.<p>The new GPL (v.3) appears to grant a license for the term of copyright. Not sure what that means. But, it also gives  a license to someone you distribute the work to from the orignal copyright holder. To me, this means if you try to distribute a project with someone else's modifications, the person receiving the project gets a GPL license on those modifications, not your expensive license. Since the original work can also be distributed, essentially this means the whole thing can't be un-open-sourced.<p>Basically, the only thing I think he can do it make his own modifications, and release those for a fee. He cannot stop anyone from releasing the original or the original with others modifications.",1231532813

Note, of course, that I prefer Git over Hg, grain of salt, etc:<p>I see the ""GitHub vs. BitBucket"" debate brought up most often in the context of users new to the DVCS concept, who have not yet investigated or chosen a favorite between the two.  In this context, the fact that GitHub's community is far larger is a valid point and benefit, and a big draw for new users.  The same goes for the better fork-related features.<p>I honestly think that <i>because</i> the two look and function quite similarly, the details are really what are important when trying to decide which tool you want to spend your time with.  Setting aside the fanboy arguments relating to Git and Hg themselves, I think that GitHub makes for a very compelling reason to choose Git over Hg/BitBucket, simply because it has the ""better"" community and features.<p>Now, perhaps if schacon had made his argument in this fashion, rather than the screen-by-screen accusations, no apology would have been necessary?

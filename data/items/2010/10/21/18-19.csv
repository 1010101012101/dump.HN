In terms of raw performance, Arrandale is competitive with the 320M (maybe a wee bit slower).  Overall, Arrandale will be attractive to Apple with OpenCL support, since they no longer need two chips -- just the CPU package which has <i>everything</i> it needs (graphics, memory controller, etc).  That allows space for better thermal solutions, more memory or SSD storage, a larger battery, or other functionality.<p>Hence the decision to stay with the current nVidia 320M and Intel Core 2 Duo -- once Arrandale supports OpenCL, we'll see Apple transition.

1816934,comment,1814596,1816010,0,0,pjscott,,,"You can definitely get a lot out of using better abstractions, as the success of MapReduce has shown. I'll list a few ideas, with the warning that they may be half-baked:<p>* Strong, stern type checking has always been kind of a pain in the ass, but it's very effective at catching miscellaneous stupid errors. If debugging in the cloud is hard enough, then maybe overbearing type systems are the lesser of two hassles.<p>* Interactive programming is a big win. One of the best things about Lisp is the REPL, and how well-integrated it is with the editor. (At least, if you use something like SLIME.) If I'm programming on a distributed system, I definitely want to be able to quickly test out my code, preferably in a concurrent environment. You could solve this by having a bunch of servers for this, or with some fancy simulation environment, or a bunch of virtual machines, or something. The point is, I want errors to show up fast.<p>* Really good log analysis. Ideally, any framework you're using would automatically log everything it does, and then you would use some nice tools to figure out what happened, and where it went wrong. Maybe the Loggly guys will come up with some good stuff.<p>* Data-flow oriented abstractions like what Apache Pig offers. Pig lets you define a directed acyclic dataflow graph, in which each edge is some operation like ""group by field x"", or ""filter by function f(fields)"". It compiles all this into MapReduce jobs and runs them on Hadoop. It's probably a lot harder to mess up a query in Pig than with raw MapReduce, for sufficiently complicated queries. I'm not sure how much of a performance hit you take, though.",1287687212

Of course the Federation could be floating around out there without us knowing, with its starships powered by <i>magic</i>, its technologies powered by magic, and humanoid aliens scattered about everywhere due to magic. (Yes, I know about the episode in question.) But that's not what it looks like. In reality, a modern conception of what a technologically-sophisticated culture would do results in a lot of things visible from a very great distance, the ones I previously mentioned before. And we see 0 of them.<p>Personally I do not put much stock in the idea that intelligent life is abundant and easy and <i>not a single one of them ever decides to go to another star</i>. For such a society it just isn't <i>that</i> hard and the payoff of being the first in a star system is incomprehensibly enormous, well out of proportion to the difficulty of getting there.

1816915,comment,1815064,1816406,0,0,ced,,,"Right. I think the argument was more along the lines of the Niche Exclusion Principle[1]. Once the existing complex organisms have had time to adapt ""perfectly"" and fill ""all"" of the low-level ecological niches, the barrier to entry becomes dramatically higher. The odds of evolving complexity were already abysmal. The presence of an additional barrier makes it almost impossible, since the new, unoptimized design would have to compete with the established species.<p>It's a debatable argument, with obvious parallels in the startup world.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_exclusion_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_exclusion_principle</a><p><i>In ecology, the competitive exclusion principle is a proposition which states that two species competing  for the same resources cannot coexist if other ecological factors are constant. When one species has even the slightest advantage or edge over another, then the one with the advantage will dominate in the long term. One of the two competitors will always overcome the other, leading to either the extinction of this competitor or an evolutionary or behavioral shift towards a different ecological niche. The principle has been paraphrased into the maxim ""complete competitors cannot coexist"".</i>",1287687048

1816912,comment,1816398,1816398,0,0,bobf,,,"I used a similar idea for my YC application answer to the non-computer hack question. Basically, I hacked the traditional education experience and graduated in 2.5 years, with ~$8500 of loans (without any scholarships/reduced tuition), and with lots of great work experience (I worked full time during school). Although I wouldn't advise this route for everyone, it worked out extremely well for me. Here are a few tips towards hacking the undergraduate experience:<p>1) As the author says, attend a high quality, low cost state school. If you're going to get a masters, undergrad institution doesn't matter beyond being able to get you into the masters program of your choosing. If you aren't going to get a masters, I would wager it doesn't truly matter what undergrad school you choose.<p>2) Determine your major <i>before your first semester begins</i>.<p>3) Plan your courses out meticulously, and don't take courses you don't need to.<p>4) Take as many classes online as you can.<p>5) Many professors lectures are fairly useless as they just regurgitate their powerpoint slides. Use this to your advantage -- do homework, work on your online classes, do freelance/telecommuting work.<p>6) Use a service like RateMyProfessors to find sensible professors - there are huge variances in amount of homework, number of tests, etc. between professors for the same course.<p>7) Night classes are generally easier and have less homework, because they are designed for non-traditional students with full time jobs during the day.<p>8) Take as many credits per semester as possible - for most majors, 15 is pretty easy for smart/dedicated people, even with working a part/full-time job. I took 24 my last semester, while working full time. It was basically hell, but you can do <i>anything</i> for 3-4 months of your life. (I probably wouldn't have done that, except an older guy I worked with said he had done 24 in his last semester of his masters program, working full time, and with a pregnant wife.)<p>9) Go year round, but take less classes in summer and get great internships/work more.<p>10) Books:<p>a) Make sure you need to buy the book. Lots of classes don't really require buying the book.<p>b) Make sure you really need the most recent edition, 95%+ of the time, the last edition or two editions ago was fine for me.<p>c) If you have to buy a book, get used on Amazon marketplace, half.com, etc. and resell them there after the class is over.<p>11) Get a job. This will help pay bills and reduce the amount of debt you take. Ideally, get one which will benefit your career path and allows you to work on homework. (I was a systems administrator in a generally not very busy swing shift - among other jobs.)<p>12) Change jobs as often as you can find something that looks better on your resume or pays more. Every job I took paid $10k+ more than the previous, except when I took a pay cut to do a summer internship at Goldman Sachs ($50k to $40k).",1287687030

Basically every time a player runs into each other, 50-80 times per practice or game.<p>I think the NFL is at the cusp of realizing how much damage the players' brains suffer.  They (and even the NFLPA) aren't very good about taking care of players after their careers are over.

They have only one way to get it (I mean the finest one's IITs/NITs/BITS/IIIT/Best state colleges), give there entrance exam after 12th class. Crack it, your in, don't crack it, your out.</i><p>This is pretty much the way it is in any country with a non-dysfunctional school system. Germany, Japan, etc.<p>In the U.S. we have been hypnotized by the notion of everybody is special"" and ""anybody can make it"". (Also, ""everybody has to go to college if they want a good job"".) This sort of milquetoast egalitarianism has had the expected result: diminished educational standards, even the Ivies. If you flunk the university admissions exam in Germany, you can still go to trade school and end up with an education at least as good as a U.S. undergraduate degree.",1287684089

Most don't own the means to produce all those things.<p>Most people buy those goods and choose between a range of available products. The fundamental flaw with that (at least as far as I see) is what happens if the products are unsafe.  Imagine that FDA wasn't there (or its European equivalent) and companies could sell  you anything whatsoever as food. How often have you gone shopping with a pestiside testing kid, a bacterial testing kit and a geiger counter? How do you know that all 15 type of shampoo you can buy don't all have mercury in them?<p>Basically both extremes don't work. A completely planned economy will not work but I have not seen a liberatrian utopia either so far.<p>The one advantage of the government is that at least in theory you can cast a vote to effect some change. You could not do that if you are run by Google.<p>Maybe I don't like Gmail and Gmail is the only mail in town, I can't force Google to change it. But can at least attempt to call my congressman if I don't like a particular upcoming bill.",1287684078

From what I learned, the difference is -- when you're stoned, you become numb to the pain and can think about the stuff you can't think while sober. It's like an anaesthetic for emotional (and physical pain) that might allow the healing process to go faster. Alcohol merely makes you not give a shit for a while.",1287684064

As a guy in his late 30's, I didn't want to deal with the traditional college experience.  I also didn't want some sham degree from a for-profit degree mill.  HES was a perfect option for me.<p>What isn't often mentioned is that the courses at HES are often live streamed from actual Harvard College courses.  Same course, same grading.  I've directly questioned my profs about this and they say that they don't differentiate between students in either population even if Harvard sometimes lets people believe they do.<p>The CS courses are the bomb, BTW.  The CS faculty at Harvard are very supportive of nontraditional students.",1287684012

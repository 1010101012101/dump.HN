1016168,story,,,2,3,pgbovine,"Ask HN: What are incentives for scientists to perform replication studies?",,"We often see headlines in print/online articles proclaiming ""numerous scientific studies have shown that X causes Y"".  My naive question is: What are incentives for researchers to perform replication studies?  It seems like the first published study gets a lot of acclaim and prestige within the research community, but it's much less prestigious to be like ""oh, I saw that UC Berkeley economists did a study on dataset A, so I just used dataset B from a different country and replicated their study.  I achieved similar findings""<p>It seems like it might be difficult for up-and-coming assistant professors to make a convincing tenure case if they simply performed replication studies (seems like <i>originality</i> and 'being first' are more valued for tenure), and veteran researchers probably also want to venture out to perform new breakthrough studies rather than doing replications.  I'd like to learn more about the incentives that scientists have for performing replication studies; it seems like they're very important for making sure that results are robust, but I don't see any reason why an ambitious scientist would spend time doing them rather than doing his/her own original experiments.  thanks!",1261853454
1016167,comment,1016083,1016083,0,0,slapshot,,,"Customer acquisition cost (CAC) versus long-term value (LTV) is one of the concepts at the core of any SAAS (software as a service) or subscription business.  Companies like Salesforce.com have made it their mantra to constantly drive CAC down and LTV up.<p>The factor that this site doesn't mention is the speed of acceleration.  If you can extract $200 of value from every $100 spent in acquiring customers, it sounds like you're in good shape.  But if it takes you 5 years to make that $200, then you won't be able to reinvest your revenue in getting new customers.  On the other hand, if it only takes two months to $200 back from $100 in customer acquisition cost, you can very quickly spin up a massive business from a small initial investment.  The difference between 5 years and 2 months is massive in terms of valuation and ability to self-fund.<p>He also fails to mention scalability of your marketing, but that could be a whole different post.",1261853446

1016162,comment,1015959,1015959,0,0,gruseom,,,"Remarkable. Here's what seems to be the key point (reordered a bit for clarity):<p><i>The study supported our hypothesis [...] that the premotor cortex represents intended speech as an 'auditory trajectory,' that is, as a set of key frequencies (formant frequencies) that vary with time in the acoustic signal we hear as speech. [...] In an intact brain, these frequency trajectories are sent to the primary motor cortex where they are transformed into motor commands to the speech articulators. [...We] had to interpret these frequency trajectories in order to translate them into speech.  [...] In other words, we could predict the intended sound directly from neural activity in the premotor cortex, rather than try to predict the positions of all the speech articulators individually and then try to reconstruct the intended sound [...]</i><p>Also remarkable (but maybe this is old hat to people who know about this stuff?) is that the signals they're interpreting come from neurites that started actually growing into the electrode months after it had been implanted.<p>I suppose there is a big difference between being able to interpret pre-speech frequencies in a normal brain (i.e. of a person who hasn't used this device before), versus someone being able to train themselves to communicate using this device over time. Given how adaptable the brain is, it's the latter that would seem to be the big win (and the article does vaguely imply this). Of course the device presumably wouldn't work at all if it weren't rooted in normal speech function.",1261853010

1016150,comment,1007852,1007852,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I love this topic because it gets directly to the weird way people's brains work. But I would be VERY careful about feeling like you are above the fray and others are all so logic-challenged. If anything, I've found that we're all in the same boat here.<p><i>Interestingly out-of-power Democrats are far more likely to believe the theories about in-power Republicans, and powerless Republicans far more likely to believe them about powerful Democrats. One aspect of conspiracy theories is that they are history for losers.</i><p>I remember when Clinton was in office. Good friends of mine who were Republican were convinced the man was the devil -- or something close to it. There were the cocaine rumors, the smuggling rumors, the political killings, etc. Along those same lines, some of the smartest people I know, who are also Democrats, were seriously telling me that George Bush was building detention camps to hold dissenters and that he would make himself dictator for life by preying off 9-11 fears.<p>These were serious, well-thought, respected, intellectuals. (Some of them might be reading this.) I imagine I'll start hearing from my Republican friends soon the same outlandish rumors about Obama. I frankly don't know what to do when this happens but to smile feebly and agree with them. Some cognitive blind spots resist all attempts at illumination.<p>On the other hand, this is one of those areas where you can paint with too broad a brush on either side. This is <i>really</i> what makes this topic so interesting. Let's take, say, UFOs. To some uber-defenders of logic like Mike Shermer, UFOs are nothing new and probably just artifacts of that fact that human observers are flawed. People want to sell books and there's a ""conspiracy"" among UFO'ers to gloss over inconvenient truth in order to generate wild rumors.<p>Assuming for a second that there exists some sort of atmospheric phenomenon that is real and unable to be replicated? To Shermer it's going to look like swamp gas and to the actual observers like nothing they have ever seen before. You can't make a case one way or the other (although plenty try)<p>On the other side, to the UFO-buffs, there's a government plot to cover up the ""real"" truth. More likely it's just a general quality of bureaucrats not to stick their necks out for stuff that makes them look like they are crazy. No conspiracy needed, just human nature. But to each side the other is acting irrationally and as the result of some sort of conspiracy or the other.<p>Fun stuff.",1261851931

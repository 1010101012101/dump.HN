Uloop ads can be seen plastered allover Facebook and has been gaining much traction lately with their success at various campuses.<p>Two of my friends were asked to leave school and work for Uloop for a year based on the fact that they would be receiving more VC money in about a month or so. Now I am wondering whether they will be granted such funding with Facebook's newest development.<p>What do you guys think? Will Uloop, a company that's been utilizing Facebook's popularity to gain traction and users, be crushed by the very company that has probably been Uloop's most important venue of advertising?",1179104315

He says that the Linux kernel - the deepest layer of the free operating system, which interacts most directly with the computer hardware - violates 42 Microsoft patents. The Linux graphical user interfaces - essentially, the way design elements like menus and toolbars are set up - run afoul of another 65, he claims. The Open Office suite of programs, which is analogous to Microsoft Office, infringes 45 more. E-mail programs infringe 15, while other assorted FOSS programs allegedly transgress 68.",1179103668

I included BOTH Freedom House's ranking of political freedom (which equates the US as politically equal to Western Europe) AND economic freedom (which sets the US much higher than Europe.) <p>According to Freedom House freedom of the press in the US is as free as Europe: <a href=""http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=251&year=2006"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=251&year=2006</a><p>""Where I come from, free access all the way up to PhD education is the norm""<p>It's not free. You pay for it in high taxes all your life.

He has some good guidelines to think about (thought a lot of his stuff seems based on Mihalyi's Flow theory).<p>Some bits and pieces: engagement leads to wealth, write documents in a Background-Premise-Roadmap format, create first--critize later, be realistic in application of ideals, the obvious isn't easy, and practice practice practice.",1179103041

One person said he was rejected from YC but later found out it's easy to get funding in the Silicon Valley.  How true is that overall?  Has anybody gone through the VC or angel process (in Silicon Valley or otherwise) without YC?",1179102690

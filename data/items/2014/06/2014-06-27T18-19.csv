But they are just that, excuses.<p>To summarize at least one of them, the compiler doesn&#x27;t really see it as “detecting undefined behavior and optimizing accordingly”. It sees it as doing the right thing for all defined behaviors. The sort of imprecise analysis it does lead it to consider plenty of possible undefined behaviors, many of which cannot happen in real executions. It ignores these as a matter of fact, but reporting them would not tell the programmer anything it doesn&#x27;t know, and would be perceived as noise.<p>On the example for (int i=1; i==0; i++) …, the compiler does not infer that i eventually overflows (undefined behavior). It infers that i is always positive, and thus that the condition is always false.",1403895486

7955662,comment,7953692,7953692,1,0,heygrady,,,"Taking a cynical view of the paradox, saying that not having already detected ET means that ET couldn&#x27;t exists, opens a new paradox. What if every intelligent civilization looked at the same problem and reached the cynical point of view: why bother looking?<p>And what&#x27;s to say we&#x27;re not aliens ourselves? That Prometheus movie hinted at the possibility, so did Star Trek. Both point to an original creator that uses simple biology and knowledge of evolution to seed planets with life and let it grow. Modern astrobiology, as documented in the recent Cosmos reboot, thinks that life has already been traversing the galaxy on space rocks; crashing into planets in an ice ball and taking hold where it can. While not intelligent by human standards, it still spreads ET life. With the time scales involved, it seems like space rocks with simple life on them might be spreading ET fairly evenly through our galaxy and beyond.<p>As smart as we are, we have only recently been able to hurtle some space junk out of our solar system and into deep space. The distances involved and the limitations of our current understanding of physics make it seem likely that we wouldn&#x27;t be in direct contact already. It&#x27;s taken 2 generations for Voyager 1 to travel that far.<p>Using ourselves as the perfect example, our own broadcasts haven&#x27;t reached very far into our own galaxy. If we are typical and our understanding of physics is reasonably accurate, there could be numerous human-like civilizations broadcasting and sending out probes constantly and we just haven&#x27;t waited long enough -- the distances are too vast for us to have heard them. Or worse, we&#x27;re not intelligent enough yet to listen to the broadcasts that are being sent to us already.<p>I say we build these magical self-replicating probes and send them out and hope we don&#x27;t accidentally create the Borg. The only way to beat the paradox is to play along. And if we don&#x27;t find anything, then we&#x27;d better get to colonizing!",1403895142

A college graduate in CS would typically enter government service as an O-1 or GS-7, step 1.  Both are less than $40k/year.  Pay maxes out at around $150k/year after 18 years of unremarkable service.  If you somehow manage to become a 4-star general of the cyberbrigades, in essence the CEO of Army Programming, Inc., you could possibly earn $180k per year, with no equity, but a nice pension plan.<p>But you won&#x27;t get even half that far.  The mental processes involved in creating military procedures are fundamentally incompatible with those involved in software development.  It is worth noting that everything Original Poster did to improve anything was completely against the rules, and was only permitted because it actually worked out in the field, and did not negatively impact anyone&#x27;s duties.<p>Government hiring is ridiculous.  I once overheard a conversation about the possibility of converting contractors to employees.  As it turns out, thanks to the preference ranking systems, the person most perfectly qualified to do the job, because that is exactly what he was currently already paid to do, with over 10 years of experience doing just that, would typically turn up no earlier than the third page of applicants.  Every one of them would have to be individually considered and rejected before reaching the person already doing the job.  Also, he would have to take a 50% cut in pay.<p>Essentially, the government cannot compete in the open job market for any skill that makes a person worth hiring.  They are therefore forced to train existing military personnel in software wherever necessary.  And as expected, they train for that in a similar manner to the way they train everything else.  The person is ordered to transfer to Fort Wherever for six weeks, to become a programmer.  You end up with a person that thinks Waterfall is a good process, better programs have more lines of code, and that unit tests are written from an Excel template.<p>You cannot solve a problem from the same state of mind that created it.  The military is covered with leechlike contractor companies because they have been forbidden by law, by regulation, and by standing order from solving their own problems in an effective way.

7955536,comment,7952273,7953375,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"I don&#x27;t think that fixes it. The closest you could come is to have n physical timers to sort n elements, but then your &quot;sorting algorithm&quot; can&#x27;t sort more than n elements. As soon as you had more elements than timers you would still need some actual sorting algorithm to determine priority.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like claiming you have an O(n) sorting algorithm because you can run an O(n) selection algorithm to find the kth smallest element for each of 0..n-1 and then run n of them in parallel on n cores to get an O(n) sorting algorithm. If you actually have n cores then the wall clock time for executing that algorithm will be O(n), but the number of operations won&#x27;t be and it all falls apart when you run out of hardware parallelism.<p>It reminds of me of bucket sort. There is an intellectually curious implementation to sort a list of unique fixed-width (e.g. 32-bit) integers that goes like this: You allocate an m bit (e.g. 2^32 bit / 512MByte) array and zero it (O(m)), then you inspect every element and set that bit of the array (O(n)), then you traverse the array and add an element to the end of the sorted list for every set bit (O(m)). So the overall algorithm is actually O(1) in the number of elements, because you&#x27;re doing m+n+m work where m > n, which means you&#x27;re doing at most m+m+m. The problem is that in practice for most real lists the constant factor is so much larger than n that using an O(n log n) sorting algorithm will be significantly faster. And it&#x27;s clearly Do Not Use if you&#x27;re sorting e.g. 128-bit ints. But for n sufficiently close to m it can actually be useful. It would probably be tough to beat for sorting a 3 billion element array of 32-bit ints. Or a 200 element array of 8-bit ints.",1403893930

On a trip to South Asia, I met a desperately poor mother who brought me her two small children and implored me: &quot;Please take them home with you.&quot; When I begged her forgiveness and said I could not, she said: &quot;Then please take one.&quot; . . . When I talk with the mothers I meet during my travels, I see that there is no difference at all in what we want for our children. The only difference is our ability to give it to them.<p>This is such a tremendously important message that I don&#x27;t think you can even hope to accurately perceive the world without really internalizing it.<p>The other day, someone told me a story. He was working maintenance in an apartment building, and went into a unit one day. Inside the unit, he saw a couple passed out on the couch, and a baby screaming in his crib. He went over to the baby, and saw a cockroach crawl out of his diaper. The diaper was stuck to the baby&#x27;s skin. He called 9/11 immediately, the police came, and the building fired his maintenance company for not going to the building management first. This wasn&#x27;t South Asia, it was here in the U.S.<p>I heard that story, and then thought about how our daycare e-mails me daily an itemized list of the time of every diaper change and whether it was wet and/or BM. I thought about how unfair it is that she started life with a leg-up, from the hospital where she took her first breath, and yet how I&#x27;m totally driven to give her every unfair benefit I can (&quot;you know honey, we <i>could</i> afford private school from pre-K if we budget carefully&quot;). Intellectually, we want life to be fair for everyone, but being a parent means having this overwhelming urge to clear the path ahead for your offspring, burning down the forest if you have to.<p>I&#x27;m certainly not going to send my daughter to an inner-city public school to make a point. What gets to me is our inability as a society to acknowledge the cognitive dissonance, and speak about this issue honestly outside of graduation speeches. To talk about traits like intelligence and patience in terms of what they are: winnings in the genetic lottery, rather than as the result of moral virtue. To acknowledge that &quot;equality of opportunity&quot; is a vicious fiction and understand that not as a call to any particular political ideology, but as a fact of the universe that we must reconcile with any political ideology.",1403893908

My impression (from reading Wikipedia and past announcements) was that it was closer to Lightroom in intended use?<p>I&#x27;ve recently seen a few articles about startups/business ideas in the mobile/consumer photo space pointing at the problem of users not having enough storage space for photos. I <i>guess</i>? My perception and personal experience has been that users don&#x27;t have enough <i>ability</i> to sort/filter the photos they already take. Digital/phone photography has allowed users to be voracious photographers...without a corresponding increase in being able to handle the information overload...it&#x27;s already hard enough to pick the best photo among 5 - 10 takes, but a cognitive-chore to search through a flat-folder collection of thousands of photos with nothing more than a vague recollection of the photo&#x27;s date...a wedding photographer once told me that by far, the best marketing tool he has is to produce a physical album of 50-100 photos, rather than just a PhotoDVD of thousands of photos. Theoretically, that DVD can be reproduced and sent around, and many more photos included for the client&#x27;s enjoyment...but realistically, clients (and their relatives) don&#x27;t find browsing through photo volumes on their OS default viewer to be engaging. Brevity in editing is important, but also, visitors to a client&#x27;s living room can directly see and touch the physical photo album (and see who produced it), and that in itself is an effective marketing tool.<p>I guess this is a long way of saying that whatever the state of Aperture was, I hope Apple makes some innovations in photo sorting/filtering, rather than just trying to provide tools to beautify photos. I&#x27;d argue that Instagram&#x27;s killer feature is how it <i>limits</i> the user&#x27;s ability to hoard photos...once you take a photo, you are pushed into publishing it...the photo filter is a way to make you feel less self-conscious about it. After taking 100 photos with Instagram, you have 100 photos to show off in a nice web album. If you take 100 photos with just your standard phone camera app, you have 100 photos waiting to be uploaded/downloaded to iCloud into a standard file system.",1403893213

If I&#x27;m bootstrapping a startup, That $2000 is easily at least 1 entire year of web hosting, or a new MacBook, or a couple of new servers. Bootstrapping has thin enough margains that $2000 is a large amount of money and runway for a young company and that&#x27;s only for one dev. Have two dev&#x27;s? that&#x27;s even more of your runway gone. $4000 could sustain two devs for two months if they are really cheap and try hard. Xamarin is unlikely to save you that two months.<p>2. If I&#x27;m developing an indie game there are A HUGE amount of cheaper better options available. Unity, Unreal, Cry Tech, cocos2D/3D, or Apportable. All cheaper and better for game dev.<p>3. If I&#x27;m learning how to develop mobile apps with the hope of  obtaining a full time job. Then Xamarin job posts are fairly rare, so spending even $600 to learn the dev process and then still not have the skills to get a full time position is a losing value equation.<p>4. There are cheaper tools out there, like Ruby Motion or Apportable.<p>I think the Xamarin guys are brilliant and made a great product but I think the value is very limited to existing Dot Net or independent app developers.

But it sounds like you&#x27;re in a position where you could actually bootstrap this. Equity is expensive. Think twice before raising money.<p>- Think in terms of milestones. What can you do to get to $XX,XXX in revenue per [week,month,year]. Then, what can you do to launch at an additional school while still staying cash-flow positive? This sort of thinking breaks the process into bit-sized chunks. Much easier to digest.<p>- Your biggest problem will likely be scaling the ad sales efforts. Walking into local businesses works great for 1, 2, 3 schools. But it will be hard to scale that to 100 universities.<p>I&#x27;d love to help out in any way I can. I started a company in grad school that I sold last year. I&#x27;ve been through many of these issues before. mkijewski at g mail.",1403892408

I struggled all this time to come up with the best designs and solutions for my clients. Then I noticed that all design patterns are repeating. Eventually, I got bored. Picked up Django and Python programming in 2012 and never looked back. Now I&#x27;m starting with Objective-C (Cocoa). The fact that you can code your ideas and design solutions at the same time is such a relieve.<p>Design is not hard to do, but it&#x27;s hard to master. It takes time, a lot of time. But once you get it then there&#x27;s not much else to learn. There are design patterns repeating themselves, just like math formulas and theorems.",1401526428

That is why HSV is not appropriate – its H, S, and V scales are only approximations of axes that categorize colors as humans perceive them. For instance, V (value) roughly corresponds to how light or dark a color is, but blue with maximum V is way darker than yellow with maximum V.<p>I don’t know what the best model is. HSL, at least, is a simple-to-understand strict improvement over HSV. Other people in this thread are suggesting models I don’t know much about like CIELAB and CIECAM02.

A Master&#x27;s in Pharmacy should be enough.  However, don&#x27;t confuse Coursera with real skills in IT.  Reality is very different from any university education. You need experience before you can tackle hard problems. Make sure your first job is at a place with skilled senior colleagues and you will soon realize that this this is the start of your real education.  Good luck in your career!",1401523425

Hell, I often don&#x27;t know what country I&#x27;m going to be in, let alone whether I&#x27;ll have free time and an internet connection. So for my lifestyle, the relatively simple mapping from traditional tertiary course formats across to MOOCs is fundamentally flawed one, though I believe they are improving these days by offering access to all materials immediately. Another thing is downloads ... I just want everything, please. I&#x27;m often offline, as I believe many developing country learners may be. I don&#x27;t want to have to register, log in, then painfully click through everything bit by bit. I want bittorrent with early-to-late material download priority.

I like to read the overview (theory, executive summary, what's different), but after that I just want to code something.<p>Whenever I have trouble figuring out how to do something, THEN I refer to the documentation.<p>Maybe I do it this way because I have never met a language that didn't have 10 times as much stuff as I needed.",1202309991

110294,comment,110035,110193,0,0,dejb,,,"I admit the volume isn't huge. Maybe 10K per day on the presidential nominations. So you might be able to average placing 1K on per day without destroying your odds. If you had even a 10% edge then that's $100 gain which most people wouldn't be giving up their day job for. There are other markets though. Betfair had turned over $3 million on the Dem Nom.<p>The funny thing is the more accurate the market is the less 'smart money' would be attracted to profits and vice versa.<p>Good luck with your trading. By participating you will presumably increase the accuracy of the market. But I think the average trader might be more knowledgeable than you give them credit for (even ones from those non-US places). And you never know... there might actually be something in this 'Wisdom of the Crowds' thing.",1202308798

I get it.<p>But Apple's been <i>really</i> good about dealing with EXACTLY the sort of issue that Atwood is running into.  I've transfered songs between many, many computers without any trouble at all.<p>And I didn't have to pay.",1202308546

By 'significant,' I mean that we're still pursuing the same core business concept, but we've made big changes to how the concept is executed (and how our customers interact with it).<p>The original idea was too derivative and didn't have significant uniqueness. The updated idea is new to the market (based on our research).",1202308221

110290,comment,110264,110283,0,0,jorgeortiz85,,,"Google's model was inspired by Berkshire Hathaway. I'm not entirely certain, but I don't think it's very common to have such a two-tiered insider/outsider voting system. It really dilutes the value of the ""outsider"" shares. (Especially if, as in Google's case, you promise to never, ever pay dividends. If you never get dividends, and you don't get to vote, then what are you paying for when you buy a share? A pyramid scheme? You hold some claim to Google's assets, but it's essentially unenforceable unless Google decides to buy back its shares or dissolve the company. Both are decisions that are taken based on voting power that you don't have.)<p>As for buying a company's stock: Who are you going to buy your 11 shares from? If I don't want to sell them, and no one else owns any, then where do they come from? The Company could issue more shares for you to buy, but it doesn't have to. And if I control the Company, I can tell it whether or not to issue more shares. When you buy shares on the stock market, you aren't buying them from the Company itself. You're buying them from someone else who owns shares and wants to sell them. If no one wants to sell, there are no shares to buy.",1202307893

Others would just be specific mashups / blends that DJ's might just do live on air; a lot of them record their sessions and trade tracks with each other, but they're not going to put it up on p2p.",1202307064
110284,comment,110035,110172,0,0,dejb,,,"I have a reasonable understanding of Brownian motion. Your comment indicates that you don't really understand markets. In an efficient market system (one which is perfectly predictive of chance of an event occurring based on observable information) it should not be possible to know if the price is going to go up or down. If could know for certain then obviously the price is wrong (and you could make a risk-free profit). So yes this would obviously look a lot like a random walk. However if you look at the graph of the odds through time (say for Obama winning the democratic nomination) you'll see it is responding to new information (such as poll results etc). It represents the aggregate opinion of the participants. If you were confident that your opinion is more accurate than this group then you could profit by betting.<p>Oh crap I just wasted more time on this.",1202306607

Is that common practice to have this kind of differentiation between a company's stocks?<p>Second (newbie) question: say you have a public company with only one type of stock: 1 share 1 vote. You have 10 shares. I have none, but I plan to buy 11 (so that I end up with more than 50% of the total). What kind of restrictions there exists in order to prevent me from taking over your company?",1202306439

In order to apply for EB-2 or EB-3 you need to first do a prevailing wage determination (about 2 weeks).  Then your employer has to recruit for the position they want to offer you (30 days posted + 30 days quiet period).  After this your employer gets to apply for a PERM (this is currently taking 8-9 months to be adjudicated by the DOL).  If you&#x27;re unlucky enough to be audited in your application you can tack another year on to this step.<p>After your PERM is approved, you get to file for I-140, which takes another 4-6 months.  Then you get to wait until your priority date becomes current which depends on your category and country of origin.  This could be anywhere from immediate to 10+ years.<p>Once your PD is current, you get to apply for I-485 which takes anywhere from 2-6 months and includes doctors exams, finger printing and possible interviews by USCIS.  Of course while they&#x27;re processing this there is no guarantee they wont retrogress your priority date and put you back into the waiting game.<p>Of course all of this starts again if you change employers (but you do get to keep your priority date if you had an approved I-140).",1393948252

Because (…), to who do you reward the right to decide which speech is harmful, or who is the harmful speaker? Or to determine in advance what are the harmful consequences going to be, that we know enough about in advance to prevent? To whom would you give this job? To whom you’re going to award the task of being the censor?<p>Isn’t the famous old story that the man who has to read all the pornography, in order to decide what is fit to be passed and what isn’t, is the man most likely to become debauched?<p>Is there anyone you find eloquent enough to decide for you what you could read? You would give the job to decide for you? To relieve you from the responsibility of hearing what you might have to hear?<p>Does anyone have a nominee? Hands up?<p>You mean there is no one who is good enough to decide what I can read? I had no idea.. But there’s a law – or some pebbling sub section of a law – that says there much be such a person. Well to hell with that law. It is inviting you to be liars and hypocrites and to deny what you evidently already know already.<p>About this censorial instinct: we basically know already what we need to know, and we’ve known it for a long time, it comes from an old story form again a great Englishman (..) Dr. Samuel Johnson, the author of the first great dictionary of English language. When it was complete he was waited upon by various delegations of people to congratulate him, (..) also by a delegation of respectable ladies of London (…). Dr Johnson, they said: “we are delighted to find that you’ve not included any indecent or obscene words in your dictionary.”<p>“Ladies, said dr Johnson, “I can congratulate you on being able to look them up.”<p>Anyone who can understand that joke gets the point about censorship, especially prior restraint as it is known in the US for it is banned by the first amendment of the Constitution. It may not be determined in advance what words are apt or inapt. No one has the knowledge that would be required to make that call and – more important – one has to suspect the motives of those who do so. In particular those who are determined to be offended, those who will go through a treasure house of English language (..) in search of filthy words, to satisfy themselves, and some instinct about which I dare not speculate…</i> - Christopher Hitchens<p><a href=""http://howtoplayalone.wordpress.com/hitchens-on-free-speech/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://howtoplayalone.wordpress.com/hitchens-on-free-speech/</a>",1393948202

Munin is good for out of the box graphing, but relatively poor for actual monitoring/alerting and hard to write new plugins for with limited availability of additional plugins.

If there&#x27;s no government, there&#x27;s no governing. Now, I wouldn&#x27;t mind anarchy, but we must adopt it, if we choose to, with our eyes open: it does mean an end to collectively putting our resources together towards common goals (and you can&#x27;t say that you can collectively organize without government because that&#x27;s an oxymoron, as government means the way in which a society chooses to organize).<p>I do think, though, that almost any imaginable form of society has been thought of at one point or another, and I would suggest that you learn about those atecedents and how they played out. A &quot;<i>society... not based on arbitrary geographical bounds</i>&quot; was the slogan of communism, a beautiful ideal that didn&#x27;t quite live up to expectations.<p>Also, I would suggest that if you have revolution in mind, get out more and learn what people really want.

Not that that would mean success, necessarily. When the communists wanted to established their own world order, not based on national borders, they actually thought about this problem a lot: how the world came to be this way. They even came up with the right answer: all human conflict is a result of an unequal distribution of resources. The only thing they missed (which turned out to be crucial), is that humans, by virtue of their evolutionary wiring, probably, like it that way. So conflict is a result of inequality, but we want inequality. Illogical, but that&#x27;s what we are. Also, conflict, while brutal, does tend to bring out the creativity in people, which is another thing they missed.<p>As an observer, I&#x27;d love to see a revolution take place (&#x27;cause that&#x27;s cool), but I&#x27;d hate it to bring about something worse.

UK or Britain, but not &quot;England&quot;. Please. We don&#x27;t have an English Army. We have an English football team, but that is a different story, and &quot;the Germans always win&quot;.<p>3. The British Armed Forces strength (especially its navy) has been severely depleted in the last 20 years. They currently only have two aircraft carriers, HMS Illustrious and HMS Ocean. Illustrious was refitted to cover for Ocean whilst in refit (still ongoing), and then would be decommissioned afterwards (sometime this year). The Royal Navy decommissioned the awesome but expensive Harriers [ii]. They (we) have no fixed wing aircraft carriers anymore [iv]. This is all due to the Strategic Defence and Security Review [i] in 2010 in order to save £38 billion. David Cameron went to town and stripped the British Armed Forces to its bare naked minimum as part of this review and stated that:<p><pre><code>   &quot;From a strategy over-reliant on military intervention to a\n   higher priority for conflict prevention. From concentrating \n   on conventional threats to a new focus on unconventional threats. \n   And from armed forces that are overstretched, under-equipped and \n   deployed too often without appropriate planning to the most professional \n   and most flexible modern forces in the world, fully equipped for the \n   challenges of the future.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nSo, in summary, Britain doesn&#x27;t have the capability to defend itself without the US backing it. It can&#x27;t even service its own Vanguard submarine Trident II missiles. The UK is a mouth piece.

Any off blockchain transaction is basically an unsettled (and therefore reversible) bitcoin transaction. So for example, trades on bitcoin exchanges and payments between web wallets will have separate and distinct settlement phases. Generally bitcoin enthusiasts gloss over this though, because they don&#x27;t like the idea of reversible transactions.<p>The current maximum transaction rate for the bitcoin networks is something like seven transactions per second. So either they&#x27;ll have to figure out how to increase that or move to a more conventional clearing and settlement system if bitcoin-as-a-payment-network ever takes off in real size.",1393946850

It isn&#x27;t so much how many coins you have, but how often each one gets spent.

An accidental deletion.  A hard drive failure.  Losing a laptop or having it stolen.  You have to back everything up, you have to back it up offsite, and you have to trust the offsite backup.  You have to keep your machines securely locked down.<p>All of this requires the user to be quite tech savvy.

You can&#x27;t have the ruler &quot;look bad&quot; even for trivial stuff, and he&#x27;d rather send thousands or tens of thousands of people to their death, than be embarrassed himself.<p>We can argue whether Russia is a dictatorship or not, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a lot closer to one than to democracy, especially when opposition leaders and protesters are arrested, and everyone else in the Parliament votes for whatever Putin says, out of fear for their lives, and elections are being robbed like there&#x27;s no tomorrow, while Putin gets to interpret the Constitution as he&#x27;s being allowed to rule virtually forever in Russia.<p>If Russia had a functioning democracy and Parliament, it wouldn&#x27;t matter that Putin was &quot;embarrassed&quot; and made to look like a fool (which I don&#x27;t think anyone thought that, at least not from outside of Russia, but it seems to be more of a thing in his mind).",1393945451

Meaning, to fix it would require changes to how Windows works at a fundamental level in such a way as to break backwards compatibility (which is sacrilege in Microsoft land).<p>Consider for a moment all the tools and mechanisms in place to synchronize Active Directory passwords across domains, realms, and even 3rd party systems.  Every one of those would completely break if you were to implement simple change such as the use of a salt.<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve been saying for many years now that, &quot;if you care about security <i>do not use Windows</i>.&quot;  There&#x27;s no mechanism available to actually make it secure because <i>you can&#x27;t change how it works internally</i>.  The best you can hope for is some obfuscation/hacks/tricks in regards to hardening (e.g. rename Administrator account, use entirely different credentials for administrative tasks, disable zillions of insecure defaults, etc).  Then just hope you&#x27;re never targeted.<p>If just <i>one</i> workstation is compromised an attacker can elevate their privileges to that of Domain Administrator with a few simple steps:<p>1. Install keylogger or password-dumping tool.\n2. Force workstation to unjoin from the domain or cause some other problem that requires a Domain Admin to login to correct the issue.\n3. Use credentials of Domain Admin to access a Domain Controller.\n4. Dump the entire password database of Active Directory.\n5. Crack the password database using some GPU instances in minutes.<p>After step #2 the attacker basically &quot;owns&quot; your network and can do whatever they want.  You can mitigate it by joining Windows workstations using credentials that <i>only</i> have the power to perform a join but this is usually just a minor setback for an attacker as there&#x27;s a plethora of tools and tricks they can take advantage of to escalate to Domain Admin.<p>For more information on how easy all this is:  <a href=""http://pentestmonkey.net/uncategorized/from-local-admin-to-domain-admin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pentestmonkey.net/uncategorized/from-local-admin-to-d...</a>",1393945442

For example, deregulation of freight and airlines in the 1970&#x27;s allowed the modern integrated delivery networks that make Amazon possible. The trend since then has been to avoid these particularly heavy-handed and market-distorting sorts of measures. I don&#x27;t think even proponents of heavier banking regulations espouse regulating banks in the way we say regulated passenger railroads (which killed them).<p>In the context of cabs, a &quot;lightly regulated&quot; regime might require background checks, minimum insurance, and some sort of mechanism for verifying driver identity and reporting problems. Variables like rates, capacity, coverage area, etc, could be left to the market.",1393945410
7340555,comment,7337278,7338332,3,0,tel,,,"I feel like a big force that changes programming style is the gradual transition from guess-and-check to gradual bricolage, exploration, creation. I feel in my perspective like that explains at least a bit of the difference between &quot;young&quot; and &quot;old&quot; programmers here.<p>Guess and check programming tends to optimize around fast reset cycles so that many, many solutions can each be tried with little investment. This is the programmer who loves to refresh their window every second to see how their changes impacted the product. It&#x27;s high energy and exciting. It also lends itself to prepackaged solutions—be they existing frameworks of specific transliterations of known algorithms. I also find that it tends to generate spaghetti code more quickly (all styles do, but GnC does so more quickly) and to fall flat on tasks which have either slow reset cycles, long dependency chains, or are difficult to visualize.<p>&quot;Slow&quot; programming, for the lack of a better word, orients itself around a deep understanding of both the domain and the natural &quot;seams&quot; in the problem space. It involves a lot of quick drafts that are perhaps never even observed—the mere act of trying and failing to express the problem elegantly is highly informative. It tends to find less &quot;obviously optimal&quot; solutions because it&#x27;s in search of novel optimal solutions. It also tends to be more easily guided by high-level goals such as business value or elegance. Finally, programming slowly requires great reasoning skills and thus is more amenable to tools and processes which enhance reasoning. It can take stabs at deep, difficult domains because it happily uses great domain modeling or mathematical skills to break those challenging domains into clever, interlocking, and simple pieces. For all this though it suffers from having a design aesthetic and becomes less willing to &quot;just dive in there and try all 500 solutions&quot; in case one of them works.<p>I think this cuts broadly across several stylistic differences in coders. I think that age and experience pushes one toward the latter style. I also think that they both have strengths and weaknesses—so I strongly agree that mixed style teams are valuable.",1393945401

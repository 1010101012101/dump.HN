Currently most social tools are very good at taking in the explicit data and showing people their own implicit data (think Tweets, Retweets, Followers), but there is--from a user standpoint--a lack of open analytic data showing the impact of their own behaviors.",1329677979

If you are receiving assistance, any money you earn above a certain amount threatens your assistance.  So you hide it or stay below the arbitrary limit.  This is not the way to encourage honesty or industry.<p>How long were things done that way, despite the facts?  Decades.  And that's the problem with government administering charity.  It doesn't look at the results and adjust its approach until outcomes improve.  Its driven by political considerations.  And when it does measure reality, it measures those things that make it look successful.<p>And why should it look honestly at outcomes?  Government doesn't have to convince you to support a program.

""<p>I just went through a month with a 90 year old friend whose life ended almost exactly like the story in that story.  He had one lucid 30 mins when I was there and his family was there (he had been a general physician for almost 50 years).  In his brief period when he had the energy to try and communicate whilst almost totally paralysed, it was clear he was telling the attending doctor that he wanted them to stop all medication and let him die.  His own family could not face that fact, and said they'd ask him again the following day (unfortunately the cowardly doctor backed them up on this).  He was never again lucid or strong enough to insist that treatment be stopped.  He lived for another 10 days, struggling to breathe, almost totally paralysed, unable to control his bowels.<p>This was a man who when I last went on holiday with him at the age of 85, he insisted on carrying his own suitcase and refused a wheelchair, even though he had trouble walking and had blood pressure and angina problems.<p>I don't blame his family not being able to make that decision (it's so hard to let go of someone one loves).  But his last weeks were undoubtedly torture, and they know they refused to follow his wishes.  It was just terribly sad and an awful dilemma.<p>I was really glad of something else I read on HN about 6 months ago, where a doctor had a brain tumouur (or something like that) and instead of treatment, he lived out the remainder of his life doing the things he loved.  I think that idea was what meant I could come to terms with the need to respect my friend's last wishes.  I just could not convince his family.",1329677718

Ascribing it solely to medicine is unfair, but it is our responsibility.<p>Could we extend the average lifespan of adults by 10 years by spending money? Easily. Most people live thoroughly unhealthy lives, many of them because they simply don't know better. Consider the whole ""obesity epidemic"". A large number of people will die comparatively young because of a complete failure of our society to teach them how to eat decent food.<p>Beyond simply curing gross mistakes in self-care, what about positives? Could we find ways to get the average healthy person to treat their body even better, and squeeze out some more life expectancy? I'm sure we could. More thorough study of the effects of nutrients and toxins, more efforts to reduce the amount of crap in people's food and other items that they come into daily contact with, etc, those would probably net another few years of improvement.<p>And that's only looking at western society. If you look at poorer countries, there are countless avoidable deaths there. Some organisations, like the Gates foundation, are trying to address some of the more obvious killers, like Malaria, which have been neglected for decades (if we'd really wanted to get rid of Malaria in the 50s, we would have done so).<p>Overall, I think it's fair to state that we could raise the life expectancy of almost every human on this earth by 10 years if we really tried. But we choose not to. There are 7 billion humans on this planet, and every day, we, as a society, make a choice, to not bother to create 70 billion man-years of life-expectancy.<p>It is a choice, or rather a lack of choice, and so yes, it is a responsibility.

3609991,story,,,7,2,AlexCoventry,"Ask HN: Is there a market for batched distributed Monte Carlo computation?",,"I've been working on an extension to the bitcoin protocol called   \nNooShare in which participants can buy the right to specify a Monte  \nCarlo calculation to be run as part of the blockchain's proof of work\nalgorithm [1].  I'm pretty excited about this, because in principle it\ncould be useful for a variety of optimization and inference problems,\nand even if it only got to be as big as litecoin [2] is today it would\nbe a substantial computational resource.  But I am also worried that it\nforces a model of computation which many potential users will find alien\nand difficult to program to [3].  Andrea Arcangeli's CPUShare was a\nsimilar marketplace for computational resources, with a similar\ncomputational model.  CPUShare died, and one of the main frictions he\nfaced in selling his service was that people wanted to just run their\nexisting code, which relied on languages his security model couldn't\nhandle, file system storage, real-time network communication, etc. [4]<p>I think building distributed computation into a blockchain the way I'm\nproposing with NooShare potentially solves a chicken-and-egg problem\nCPUShare probably had.  That is, because all transactions were spot  \ntrades denominated in conventional currency, no one was interested in\nplugging their computers into the CPUShare network to sell time because\nno one else was buying time, and no one was buying time because the\nresources on sale were so small.  Hopefully there will be a contingent\nof early NooShare miners who are excited about winning currency which\nwill grow in value as the computational resources committed to the\nnetwork grow, just like the early bitcoin adopters.<p>But, I am really concerned about the potential level of demand for\nNooShare's computational resources.  Does it sound to people here like\nthere would be a market for this?  Any suggestions for how I could  \nexplore this question without implementing NooShare in its entirety?\nSomething along the lines of ""build an MVP involving just the\ncomputational framework you intend to use, and see whether people buy\nit,"" except that then I'm back in the same situation as CPUShare, with\nno substantial computational resources to motivate its adoption.<p><pre><code>  Notes\n  -----\n\n  [1] http://tinyurl.com/nooshare\n  \n      (Google doc preview of pdf.

It is the perspective of leftists-- an ideological perspective-- that ""fascism"" is ""right-wing"".<p>For instance, the Nationalist Socialist Workers Party, also known as the Nazis, were a pro-union, pro-socialism, pro-farmer, party.   It seems that the accusation of ""right wing"" comes from using the term as a synonym for ""authoritarian"".<p>The dictionary.com definition is better:<p>fascism [fash-iz-uhm] \nnoun\n1.( sometimes initial capital letter ) a governmental system led by a dictator having complete power, forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism, regimenting all industry, commerce, etc., and emphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism.\n2.( sometimes initial capital letter ) the philosophy, principles, or methods of fascism.\n3.( initial capital letter ) a fascist movement, especially the one established by Mussolini in Italy 192243.<p>Note the elements:\nA. regimenting all industry, commerce, etc.\nB. complete power\nC. forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism.<p>(I think the inclusion of ""nationalism and often racism"" is an editorial lapse here. Mussolini wasn't racist the way the Nazis were, and the role the jews played for the Nazis was an emotional one used to manipulate the country, not one intrinsic to the economic system of fascism.)<p>A. We have this to a great degree.  For every industry there's some government agency that regulates it, and those regulations seem to be unlimited in their potential scope.  They may not be completely regimented at this point, but I'm not aware of the supreme court striking down the theoretical power to do so, even when this ""Regulation"" includes completely shutting down the industry (say marijuana).<p>B. We've seen a sharp move towards complete power in the US in the past 20 years, accelerating under Bush and Obama.  Many laws are passed giving the president more and more dictatorial power, and both presidents have exercised powers they don't have under the law and gotten away with it.<p>C. I argue that we've seen this with the regulation of the media, preventing anti-government views from getting into the mainstream media, with the ""free speech zones"" eliminating the idea of free speech by default, and with the censorship of websites.<p>This shutting down of websites being the initial action that brought us to this discussion, its worth noting that it is a key element of fascism.<p>While its true the websites being shut down now are not anti-government ones, this is always how they do it.  They find some reviled group like ""terrorists"" or ""drug kingpins"" (the same role the ""jews"" played in germany) and then go after them.  Nobody's going to defend pedophiles, right?  How much internet regulation has been passed with the excuse that its to protect children from pedophiles.<p>And eventually it becomes fully regulated such that the perspectives are completely censored like they are on the nightly news.",1329676137

The algorithm is described in reasonable detail, but not completely. Filling in the last details allows some examples in the paper to be reproduced, but not all at the same time, it seems. Attempts at implementations can be found in this zip file. Further clarification would be most welcome.""",1329675747

3609899,comment,3609569,3609569,89,0,grellas,,,"I began my legal career working for several years at in Big Law. In one case, a stultifying bureaucratic management for a major steel company was building a new plant. After hiring a firm out of the midwest to manage the construction on a fixed-fee contract, it proceeded to make life miserable for that firm by making never-ending revisions to the project plans throughout the course of construction and this not only caused that firm to incur cost overruns but also had the effect of causing substantial delays in getting the work done. Everything was done through a multi-layered committee committee structure, with memos continually being circulated about needs to separate the ""wheat from the shaft"" and like gems. When it was all done, this mega-sized steel company went out and hired a professional hatchet firm to assemble a ""delay damages report"" (I don't remember the exact name but I am sure it was much more high-toned than my description here). It then used this report to send a demand letter to the midwest firm, claiming that their management of the construction project was inept and that it had to pay millions of dollars in damages on account of the delays in construction. When they refused, they got sued for the claimed damages.<p>I can still vividly remember how, as a young lawyer, I was so stunned by the sheer <i>phoniness</i> of this so-called expert report - here were a bunch of bungling, bureaucratic committee types who couldn't make a key decision to save their lives using a sham report to try to lay the blame for their own faults at the feet of an innocent firm that had simply done its job. <i>Everything</i> in that report was couched in passive voice and dressed in self-important language - to a point where you had no idea who had done what but had only a vague sense that this or that ""had transpired"" with this or that result ""having ensued."" What is worse, the report was replete with dishonest (and obviously deliberate) renderings of key facts and with conclusions that could only be reached by the most absurd disregard of logic imaginable. I remember thinking to myself: ""this is the suit-and-tie version of a stick-up in some back alley."" And the case worked out true to form, with what must have appeared to be surreal results from the viewpoint of the midwest firm's executive management. Six lawyers and four paralegals were assigned to the case. Thousands of boxes of documents were assembled with lawyers and paralegals being tasked to go through each document mindlessly summarizing it on a ""digest sheet,"" with the results ultimately to be compiled into an omnibus analysis report that could in turn be used by competing experts to attempt to rebut the absurdities of the original report. Thousands of hours of billable time racked up and this process was maybe 10 or 15% done when I decided to do a very careful analysis of a relatively few key documents only, to put the story in a context that readily demonstrated the sham nature of the ""delay damages report,"" to summarize everything in a 50-page write-up, and to give that to the partner in charge. Within a short time, the executive management of our client used that write-up to meet face-to-face with their counterpart executives on the other side and the case quickly settled for a very modest money payment. What a mess, I thought at the time, and all from a phony expert report.<p>As the facts are emerging in Oracle's attack upon Google, it is clear that there are many complex elements here by which Android might ultimately be found to infringe upon Java in this or that respect but it is equally clear that, <i>when it is all put in context</i>, the damage claims being asserted by Oracle are about as phony as one could imagine. This Groklaw piece does a splendid job of picking the high points from the critique that Google's lawyers have put together to decimate the report of Oracle's key damages expert. All I could think of as I read this was how this sort of phony ""expert analysis"" remains as prevalent as it did back in my early days of lawyering (over 30 years ago) - different legal context, different facts, same exact techniques, same sort of hired guns. It is enough to give anyone a very jaded view of law and how its outworkings can harm people. Here, Google is more than capable of being able to afford to hire the best in order to defend itself. But what does an average person or company do when faced with such situations? It is truly dismaying to contemplate.<p>Oracle will of course fight to resist Google's challenges to its damages claims and it will be up to the judge to decide. But the judge recently warned Oracle that this cycle will likely be its last chance to fix the problems with its expert's report (see <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3500459"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3500459</a> for a detailed analysis of this) and so this will soon reach a decisive point. The result will be, I believe, that Oracle will get its day in court but will only be able to proceed with a much-stripped-down version of its claims - something that might hurt Google a bit financially but will pose no real threat to the Android platform as a whole and will amount in time to nothing more than a blip on the radar.",1329675552

Rather than debate that claim, you're attacking the word he used.  Have you got a better word?  As far as I know, the term ""Fascist"" is the most clinically correct term for that type of system.  If someone <i>were</i> to use the less correct, but more emotionally charged term ""Nazi"", then your line of attack would have some merit.<p>Ironically, you've made rational discussion impossible because you're using your emotional reaction as an argument against the use of the most accurate term.<p>I believe this is a tactic.  You don't want to admit that this is happening, so you wish to deny anyone the possibility of pointing it out, by insisting that the most appropriate term is ""irrational"".<p>The irony, of course, is that this attitude on a mass scale is what allowed the Nazis in germany to obtain so much power.  Germans are not genetically fascist, they're just like everyone else.  However, like everyone else, they had a very hard time believing that their government could be doing evil, and so they lived in denial.  Even after the war, many germans found it difficult to accept that the holocaust had happened.<p>The idea that fascism, which has happened historically on more than one occasion, is impossible, is perpetuated for ideological reasons.  A cynical person might say that those perpetuating the ideology do so because they know their ideology is at its root fascist.  (In that case, you would be the victim, not the person I'm accusing.)<p>If you've got a better term for a society where the economy is privately owned but under absolute control of the government, and the necessary authoritarianism that goes with it, please feel free to propose it.<p>But your attempt to banish the word created to describe such societies simply because you don't like the implications makes rational conversation impossible.<p>For instance, rather than discuss the trends we see in the USA, we're dealing with your insistence that we shouldn't use the correct word!",1329675468

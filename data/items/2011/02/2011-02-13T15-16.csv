That entitles them to sue each defendant for said value (maybe <i>3 for wilful infringement, but that's it). You can make it easier by declaring the value of the ""property"" at any point in time during the year until 15-apr the </i>following* year, so you can evaluate in retrospect.<p>Now, all of a sudden, it doesn't make sense to hoard patents or copyrights as much - If you value each song at $100K, then it costs $1K/year to maintain that copyright.<p>I'm sure Intel/Microsoft/Apple would actually evaluate what does and doesn't need patent protection when they have to pay millions of dollars per year to maintain it.<p>Furthermore, it's only reasonable - paying tax for having the state enforce your ""property"" rights.",1297612561

However, if you want to do games, look at Unity3D ($$) - that is cross-platform.<p>I'm an iOS developer, now doing a deep-dive into Android.<p>Pretty much, the consensus among my iOS developer circle is that to be considered a serious mobile player you need three platforms: iOS, Android, and mobile web.<p>To be more marketable as a developer, there is no single platform that you want to learn (the true answer is to strive to become a better designer than coder - the best coder I know personally is a better designer - and that is one of the reasons he's had top-10 App Store apps). Learning Android has less of a learning curve. Knowing both iOS and Android is hard - I'm trying to do that now - and I've given up - shelved all my iOS projects to focus on Android.<p>Android is going to win in the long-run. WebOS is going to be a footnote in the history of tablets (unfortunately Nokia didn't buy them 2 years ago). Windows Phone 7 is a wildcard. By mobile web, I don't mean rich HTML5 - I mean decent mobile optimized websites like <a href=""http://shakeshack.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shakeshack.com</a><p>If you are going to study iPhone, just dive right in. The analyzer will save you from the most egregious of memory leaks and retain cycles. You will realize that your code you are writing sucks three or four iterations or generations down the line. Don't fret about that. You will go back and forth between the benefits of IB vs writing code for UIs directly.<p>If you are going to study Android, the code from OpenIntents is some of the best written I've seen so far [1]. A lot of the Android examples don't cover non-trivial stuff (like how do you have a ContentProvider that can handle multiple tables, how do you skin). OpenIntents shows a way, maybe not the best way - but decent, how to do all of that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/openintents/source/browse/trunk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/openintents/source/browse/trunk</a>",1297612375

2212982,comment,2210469,2210469,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I kind of groaned when I saw this title on HN.<p>Problem? The title told me it was going to be a highly-emotional appeal to an audience already primed to agree with it. And the vote score only confirmed that assumption. Time to put on the old critical thinking hat.<p>What a great article! It was a wonderfully-put-together rant about what is wrong with IP law. I agree with every point -- including the outrage the author felt.<p>The only thing I didn't agree with? The premise -- that IP laws are blocking innovation.<p>Yes, as the examples show, there is a great amount of innovation that is being stifled by IP laws, and something is desperately needed to fix it. But let's not get caught up in all that emotional outrage at how screwed up things are. Instead, ask a simple question: to what degree is <i>all</i> innovation stifled by IP laws? Because that's the claim: that every kind of innovation is being stifled by the current crappy state of IP laws.<p>Clearly that's not the case at all. The newspaper boy who invents a new newspaper folder isn't being stifled. The restaurant owner who comes up with a way to wait more tables with less staff isn't being stifled. The media creator who packages his product in a way to increase stickiness isn't being stifled. It's just a bunch of examples that members of this audience already know and are sympathetic with.<p>I could go on. And on and on. So yes, in this one area in which we are all pretty damn angry to begin with, IP laws are totally destroying innovation. But in the other thousand or so areas from which most of us have little experience, they are not.<p>I loved the rant. And I love a great title and this article had one. A little hyperbole is good for the soul. So while I have no faults with the article, I'd just recommend a little bit of common sense when dealing with a premise so over the top. People have a tendency to take whatever they're really angry about -- and then apply it to whatever problems the world is facing. IP law is not stifling <i>all</i> innovation. It isn't even coming close. But it's definitely horribly broken and needs to be fixed.",1297612176

Are you sure you aren't misunderstanding the meaning of volatile in C99 (and the C++03 standard has the same semantics for volatile as C99, it even refers back to C99 in a footnote)?<p>The C standard has no notion of the memory hierarchy and therefore does not know or care about the processor cache. Volatile means that reading/writing from/to volatile variables must strictly follow the rules of the abstract machine, and not bypass these rules as an optimization. When people say that volatile means that the value may not be cached, they mean that the variable MUST be written to or read from every time it is accessed. This means it may not be <i>cached in a register</i> or otherwise avoid the actual variable access as an optimization, that is, that it may not bypass interacting with the abstract machine. What this means is that a memory read or write must be issued, but the existance of processor caches (L1, L2, L3) is outside the scope of the abstract machine and is a platform detail.<p>On x86 and x86-64, reading or writing memory using temporal load and store instructions lets the CPU, if it feels like it, cache the value in the processor cache. As far as C knows or cares, its in memory, but its up to the CPU to decide if it actually is or not. This means that in practice, if the variable is accessed often, it would be in L1 or L2 cache and reading it would be quite fast. When writing to it (since it is volatile, a write is a store to memory instead of a mov to a register), the processor sees that the cache has changed and invalidates it for other cores, so the next read would hit main memory and get the new value.<p>Note that non of this is visible in the generated ASM (unless the compiler generated non-temporal loads/stores, in which case the rocessor cache would be bypassed), as it is applied transparently by the processor.<p>For the record, before I wrote this code, I researched it a lot. Also, Arch Robinson, the architect behind Intel Threading Building Blocks, in the comments to his article on volatile, confirmed that this works (at least on intel platforms). Furthermore, nothing I've read in the standard or other articles (such as the one you linked) contradict my assumptions. Note that anywhere I have tested this, it works as expected. I am interested in hearing if I overlooked soemthing fundamental, though, especially when porting to ARM (which, for example, may require additional instructions to make writes visible to other cores, something volatile will NOT do).<p>The C standard only states:<p><pre><code>    An object that has volatile-qualified type may be
    modified in ways unknown to the implementation or have
    other unknown side effects. Therefore any expression
    referring to such an object shall be evaluated strictly 
    according to the rules of the abstract machine, as
    described in 5.1.2.3. Furthermore, at every sequence
    point the value last stored in the object shall agree
    with that prescribed by the abstract machine, except as
    modified by the unknown factors mentioned previously.)
    What constitutes an access to an object that has
    volatile-qualified type is implementation-defined.</code></pre>",1297610194

And if it is the last one you are missing, well, that's not good.<p>AARRR is a nice conceptual schema for organizing activities-- I don't really see it is as something that is ""applied"", as much as a reminder that: a) each of the five areas is important in its own right, b) each of the five areas has separate goals, and c) each of the five areas has separate metrics.<p>At least, that's the way I'm using it.",1297609518

I've been surprised to find that at higher levels (think C-level) of management leaders who completely <i>don't</i> think of engineers as plug-and-play.  I wonder if it is an attitude or viewpoint more common in lower level management in large organizations.<p>Regardless, I kind of gave up on Java simply because I felt it seemed to get me into environments where people were treated as cogs.",1297609515

A founder demanding to retain control after a series A might be seen as difficult from the VC's eyes.  A founder who has a great vision that's not easily understood and is strong-willed might be seen as difficult, but that's the kind of brilliance and persistence that's also seen as the means to success.<p>Then again, someone who just makes outrageous demands with no reason can be worthless to just about everyone.",1297609510

Virtually all of India - including the professional class - is stuck in material deprivation vastly worse than American poverty - the average American poor consumer unit consumes $20k/year, while Indian GDP/Capita is $6k/year (adjusted for cost of living).</i><p>Here by &quot;bad&quot; choices I meant &quot;bad from comfortable western observer&#x27;s point of view&quot;. The decisions are probably mostly good from the POV of the poor person involved. People in India are stuck im material deprivation because of the environment - the state in phase space in which their society is in. Similarly, many poor people in western countries.<p>> <i>Actually, now that I think of it, English literature adjuncts are another counterexample.</i><p>Sadly, I don&#x27;t know anything about this class of people.<p>> <i>Why financial? Why not just fix malnourishment directly?</i><p>I don&#x27;t think anybody will say that this isn&#x27;t helpful. It is. Hell, it&#x27;s almost as good as giving money away, assuming you cater to his particular needs - take into account what foods he absolutely dislikes, his time schedule, his allergies, etc. Because if you don&#x27;t, if it&#x27;s MIL-STD-01 meal pack 3 times a day, this is robbing one from dignity <i>and</i> in case of people with allergies / some types of mental conditions it&#x27;s stress-inducing.<p>People generally have a need of control over their own fate. It&#x27;s a base Maslovian need. Most of the in-kind conditional help as implemented in today&#x27;s welfare denies the beneficiaries such control. This has a serious psychological impact, and you don&#x27;t have to look further than mental institutions and care houses to see the problems it causes. Or even observe how people abuse welfare or even refuse it at all in order to cling to any semblance of control over their lives they have left. Handing out cash empowers people. They can chose their meal, chose what they invest in, chose their direction.<p>Another keyword (an almost-synonym to FAE) I forgot about - correspondence bias. The general direction I&#x27;m trying to point towards is the one presented by things like Stanford Prison Experiment, Milgram Conformity Experiment, FAE/correspondence bias, the entire economy and game theory - that people&#x27;s decisions and outcomes are generally predictable based mostly on things external to them. That people follow incentives, determined by things like their mental state, stress, environment, available opportunities, etc. - and that explaining something away as &quot;laziness&quot; or &quot;bad character&quot; or &quot;irresponsibility&quot; is in most cases counterproductive.<p>If I manage to get hold of a semi-decent Internet connection (allowing to load anything better than plaintext) tomorrow I&#x27;ll look for links to some sources.",1445197827

It was the biggest employer in town, though certainly not the only large employer.

You could end up with 100s of uses of the identifier and never find the source.<p>Personally, I see this as the entire point of the original Smalltalk-esque OOP paradigm: an object <i>is</i> a living, mutating black box that responds to messages, where an object&#x27;s &quot;type&quot; is just &quot;object&quot;: a thing with a protocol for sending and receiving arbitrary messages, not a thing with particular messages it is lexically known to respond to.<p>In other words, an object is like a remote server on the Internet. You can no more introspect an object by looking at the source of the classes it was originally constructed from, than you can introspect a remote web service by reading the source of the frameworks it was based on. The set of messages an object will respond to, and how it will respond to them, is part of the object&#x27;s <i>state</i>, not part of its definition.<p>This &quot;absolute encapsulation&quot; <i>forces</i> the producer to publish an API if they want anyone to consume their object/service. This is great! If the API is machine-readable, and the object/service publishes it <i>as a response to a message</i>, an OOP runtime can even perform <i>runtime introspection</i> on the object/service, enabling consumers to <i>configure</i> themselves to speak another object&#x27;s protocol, to <i>reconfigure</i> when that protocol changes, and even for two objects to <i>negotiate</i> a communications protocol among many options.<p>People have rediscovered the benefits of black-boxes with published, oft-machine-readable APIs in the last few years, calling the new version of OOP &quot;microservices.&quot; It&#x27;s the same idea: objects with no lexical type beyond &quot;thing that responds to messages encoded in this format&quot;, being used as black-box interfaces into libraries which may be running locally or remotely.<p>This is also, effectively, the definition of a &quot;process&quot; in Erlang: something that will (asynchronously) receive messages if you send them, and <i>might</i> send you a response, or might not, with the interpretation of a given message depending entirely on the process&#x27;s state. (People who say Erlang is a functional language are looking on the wrong level of abstraction. Processes are objects!)<p>---<p>To get back to Ruby, though: imagine an object which serves as a REST client, where the method_missing of that object translates the {method_name, ∗args} into a GET request to an API server, with the method name becoming the path and the arguments becoming query parameters. This is an <i>idiomatic</i> kind of Ruby object, because Ruby is actual-OOP rather than the &quot;classes are types, right?&quot; faux-OOP of static languages.<p>The messages this REST-client object responds to depend entirely on code running somewhere else that could be modified at any time. There is nothing static analysis tools could do to figure out what this object will or won&#x27;t respond to. The only way to introspect its operation at all is at runtime.<p>And yet, I would argue that this implementation of such an object is the best, most 1:1 translation of the concept of &quot;REST client&quot; into a programming language. Errors are propagated from the remote server, through HTTP, into local dynamic-dispatch errors, through the defaults of Ruby&#x27;s runtime. You&#x27;re not having to go against the grain, writing a &quot;get&quot; method and then making up all sorts of custom exceptions it can raise. You just make a local object, that stands in for a remote object, and then you interact with it as an object.",1445197266

More about this is available from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights</a> . I think it&#x27;s best to consider this a moral philosophy that exists only as part of a consensual reality.<p>Regarding animal rights, there is less agreement on a framework for how to handle those. Animals cannot enter into a social charter, and it is difficult for them to voice objection about mistreatment. Most about this is available from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights</a> .<p>>  &quot;Why can we outlaw incest when you have a fundamental right to reproduce.&quot;<p>These rights are not absolutes but exist in tension. While we have agreed that there is a fundamental right to free speech, time, place and manner restrictions are allowed. While we have agreed that there is freedom of movement, such freedom may be limited in times of quarantine.<p>Thus, simply pointing out that there is a restriction on the right of reproduction does not make it less of a right than the rights of movement and of free speech.<p>> if reproduction is a fundamental right, can you rape other humans<p>ryanwaggoner was likely being brief on the expectation that you could do some research yourself and determine that &#x27;Reproduction is a natural right&#x27; is a short-hand for a more lengthy and nuanced definition. Quoting now from the Cairo Programme of Action at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights#Cairo_Programme_of_Action"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights#Cairo_Prog...</a> :<p>> Reproductive health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and its functions and processes. Reproductive health therefore implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so.<p>You can see that the &#x27;freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so&#x27; includes all participants. Thus, rape is not part of the right to reproduce, as it is generally understood.<p>Rape is also in tension with other rights, such as the right to free association.<p>> &quot;... absolute rights are a god given thing and period&quot;<p>Humans created all the gods. Therefore humans can create human rights.<p>> &quot;Could you still come up with the same ideas if you were the only human on earth?&quot;<p>Human rights guide how humans should be treated. If I were the only human on earth, there would be no need for the moral philosophy of human rights, just like there would be no need for thespian, oratory, or square dancing knowledge.

Edlin, Theranos’s senior product manager, titled “Select Data.” It purported to show favorable results from numerous comparison tests.

Holmes says that Theranos is certified in forty-eight states, with two more applications pending, under the federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988. Under the amendments, laboratories like hers must be certified before they can perform tests for the general public, and their performance is evaluated three times a year by the College of American Pathologists. Holmes also pointed me to a pilot study published by Hematology Reports, an online-only peer-reviewed journal; she is listed as a co-author.

I am currently homeless. My medical handicap is a primary underlying cause of my lack of housing and challenges involved in trying to resolve that.<p>It is too late to edit the comment. It may not be &quot;most&quot; poor people (ie more than 50%) but it is certainly <i>many.</i><p>I can also confidently state that a high percentage of homeless individuals have either a medical or a mental health condition that is an underlying cause of homelessness hy substantially interfering with their ability to make their life work. I believe that for the homeless population this is well over 50%, though I don&#x27;t have a citation for that either. However, my previous college class and firsthand experiences suggest that health problems lead to homelessness. I know that once you are on the street, it can be hard to take care of yourself and homelessness often does cause or worsen health issues. I think this reality masks the degree to which health problems both precede and contribute to incidence of homelessness. I think most people think people on the street are ill because they are on the street. But everything I have seen indicates most of them were ill before they became homeless and that fact contributed to them ending up on the street or outright caused their homelessness. In many cases, being on the street does cause a worsening of their health, but that should not be misconstrued as &quot;Well, they are only ill because they are homeless.&quot;<p>Everyone I have ever known reasonably well who had a serious health crisis experienced significant financial stress as a consequence, above and beyond the high medical expenses per se. Some things I have heard over the years: Job loss, time away from the job, passed over for promotion, took a demotion to a lower paying position. There are also additional expenses incurred beyond the medical expenses, such as higher food costs due to being too sick to work, transportation expenses if they need to travel to get care, etc.<p>I also recall reading in an article that the most common factor in cases where women were on welfare for very long periods and could not seem to get off welfare was that she was de facto responsible for providing care for a relative with high needs of some sort, either a special needs child or elderly parent in poor health or similar scenario.",1445197018

C-level execs of large companies get a lot of email and don&#x27;t read all of it themselves, at least not initially, especially if the email is from someone they don&#x27;t know.<p>Emailing a large company&#x27;s leader from the outside is and should be tantamount to emailing a part of their customer service team, if you are a customer. At least, that&#x27;s how they need to arrange it if they want to be responsive and are failing to be. Good customer service will also escalate complaints internally so that they&#x27;re properly dealt with, not just responded to (though they might be escalated to a subordinate of the person you intended to contact, rather than the person themselves). If someone emails your CEO, it&#x27;s a fair bet that they&#x27;re either really happy, or really unhappy and need attention, versus contacting frontline support.<p>Companies that have good customer service typically have an &quot;executive customer service&quot; team made up of their best CS reps, who have good judgment and can handle unusual situations. Executive CS would for sure research and discover who sent the communication, and consider that fact as part of their response, and how to escalate it internally.<p>To summarize, if a company cares about providing customer service, they can certainly do so, and they should look at email sent to their public figureheads as an extension of their customer service responsibility, or a delegated responsibility to the CEO&#x27;s assistant. There is no excuse for the lack of response.<p>This is also true for internal communication within a company, by the way. It&#x27;s routine for assistants to respond on behalf of the person they support for matters that are within their area of responsibility. One of the marks of a higher grade executive assistant is that you can trust them with all of your communication, and can trust them to decide on their own what they can properly respond to on your behalf.",1445195734

Without understanding root causes, this is just stamp collecting, and we have no clue how far we are from those root causes. At the very bottom (we think) is quantum field theory, which we only really understand in simple situations (eg. single particle interactions).</i><p>No matter how many more levels are down there, everything has to add up to normality. When we discovered relativity, apples didn&#x27;t suddenly start to fall up. We may discover new ways of looking at the world, or new things hiding behind that n-th fractional digit, but the world will work in the same way the day after such discovery as it worked the day before.<p>Unless the fundamental laws of the universe have conditionals that branch on cognitive state of human beings, at which point all bets are off and you can assume anything can happen. We have hovewer no evidence that would suggest that hypothesis over the usual one, that the world works the way it works whether we know how or not.<p>> <i>If a four billion old intelligent alien race handed you one of their computers, do you think you would be able to work it out any time soon?</i><p>I would be able to work <i>something</i> out. For starters, that I&#x27;m dealing with a computational device. It&#x27;s hard to imagine what would be the level of technology four billion years old aliens, nor what problems would they be trying to solve - but I&#x27;m pretty sure that if you travelled back in time and dropped Isaac Newton a PC with a nuclear battery (and infinite supply of spare parts) he&#x27;d figure out some basics of how it works and why it does the thing it does. The very process by which humans do that is called &quot;science&quot;.<p>I guess my point is - we definitely don&#x27;t know everything, but that doesn&#x27;t allow us to assume &quot;shit&#x27;s magic&quot; and every point of view is equally valid. There is observable evidence that shifts probability towards some theories and away from the others.",1445195552

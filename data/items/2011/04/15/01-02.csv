We need to educate ourselves so at least we can have a cogent conversation with techs.

Cake is neat but overkill in a lot of ways unless you happen to be one of the developers of Cake and know it inside and out.

PHP has so much of what you need done for you that only an efficient ORM is a bit tricky.<p>You're not going to have the widespread adoption of your framework that Rails enjoys. This is because Rails increases the utility of Ruby for webapps by a factor of 10x while your PHP framework improves PHP for web apps about 2x.<p>BUT, if you are using PHP you might as well write your own internal framework because it's a fun programming exercise and will take you only a little longer than mastering someone else's.<p>I went down the same path(created my own minimal php framework called uno a while back), though if I'm doing MVC apps nowadays it's almost always using Rails.

The author sets up with ""PHP is regarded as a clumsy and amateurish technology, best left to development newbies"". I am not sure who it is that regards PHP in such a way. Sure, it's not as sexy as Clojure, Scala, Ruby or Erlang these days, but I don't think anyone needs to be convinced that PHP is a worthy technology to build a platform on - some of the biggest sites out there are running on PHP just fine.<p>PHP has a bit of a reputation for attracting unskilled programmers, but that's because it is so easy to get started with, which leads to a lot of newbies writing it. All that means is that you may have to filter your candidates more carefully when you hire, and nothing to do with the language itself.<p>In short, the post seems subjective and opinionated, without showing any concrete problems that they overcame with alternative languages or frameworks.

Rackspace cloud is definitely not faster than ec2 by a long shot. Rackspace cloud utilizes homogonous infrastructure, AMD 2374 to be exact. All instance sizes are burstable, so you typically get about the same CPU resources on a 1GB instance as you do on a 16GB instance according to our benchmark results. Ec2 on the other hand scales CPU much better all the way to dedicated dual quad X5570s with the cc1.4xlarge. Both this and the rackspace sponsored bitsource study compared an ec2 m1.small. Any study that does this should be immediately discounted as that is about the worst possible performing ec2 instance size.

This would likely happen with only a couple of minutes of the flight left and at a time when workload is high (assuming IMC conditions). There would probably be a little confusion before deciding to switch back to the previous frequency.<p>Not particularly dangerous - but the pilot does have to be prepared for handling some atypical tasks on an otherwise routine approach<p>Edit to note: VFR (visual flight - night or day) would be a non-event (from the pilot's perspective) with a sleeping controller so long as traffic is relatively light, as it would be at night most places",1302830320

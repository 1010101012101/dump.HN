7041499,comment,7040351,7041226,3,0,dredmorbius,,,"Lavabit and Silent Circle are both predicated on retaining persistent user state (messages, logins, etc.), and could be required to modify back-end code to select on that and either dump state (possibly unencrypted, I&#x27;m not sure of the specifics of their methods), provide stream intercepts, etc.  The point is:  <i>user identification is integral to the services</i>.<p>DDG doesn&#x27;t operate that way.  Access it through a sufficient diversionary proxy (Disconnect Search, TOR, what have you), and you&#x27;re simply another (unknown) IP address making another (known) search request.  While I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s <i>impossible</i> to tie the two together, the cost is far higher than the case where 1) user search history is explicitly stored or 2) a direct IP history is connected.<p>Scale your countermeasures to suit your paranoia level / risk model.  If you&#x27;re concerned over browser fingerprinting (<a href""https://panopticlick.eff.org"" rel""nofollo"">https://panopticlick.eff.org/</a>), you&#x27;ll want to include privoxy as well as TOR.<p>Note that even <i>unauthenticated</i> users to Google are issued cookies, and undetermined amounts of browser state are tracked.  I&#x27;ve got a statement from a Google engineer on G+ that such indicators aren&#x27;t used to identify <i>accounts</i>, but whether or not they&#x27;re used to identify <i>end users</i> at all is an unanswered question.<p>So, short answer:  you&#x27;re right, using DDG of itself isn&#x27;t a perfect guarantee, but it&#x27;s a much smaller risk envelope than Google offers, and it can be reduced to pretty near nil with a few additional provisions, all of which hugely increase intercept costs.",1389412650

Let&#x27;s assume for a minute the founders actually wanted to keep it alive (I&#x27;m guessing they didn&#x27;t but that&#x27;s a whole other story) You&#x27;re generating revenue of say $40,000 and your Amazon costs are $30K. If you went to a small or mid tier sized provider and said &quot;Good news/bad news. We&#x27;re generating $40,000 a month and growing (oddly revenue isn&#x27;t which is again another story) You&#x27;re costing us $30,000 a month. If we can cap you at $20,000 a month for 12 months that frees us up $20,000 and we can keep 3 employees on in the short term and still grow the business. We can get through the rough patch and continue to grow and in a year from now we can adjust this upward and be worth more. If you insist on $30K, which is your right, we shut the whole thing down because we can&#x27;t keep the lights on.<p>Now the provider is either looking at generating $240,000 for the next 12 months <i>or losing everything</i> from your account. He/she is probably doing the deal with you because much of their costs are fixed.

The break even point is about 6 months for the light instances and a bit more for the medium ones. I don&#x27;t recommend the heavy ones as the cost structure is different (<i>you pay regardless of whether tt&#x27;s on so ... if you later change your instance types you still have to pay hourly for the full term of the reserve</i>).<p>Even better is if you can plan your infrastructure on AWS around using spot instances. They can be <i>really</i> cheap (<i>we&#x27;re talking a 5x times cheaper then on-demand and 3-4x than reserved</i>). If your instances are used in a stateless fashion with all persistent state saved externally (DB, S3, etc) then you can do some pretty cheap scaling with spot instances.<p>One setup I&#x27;ve played with is a core set of non-spot instances phalanxed by a number of spot instances (<i>at a couple different price points</i>) for stateless web traffic. As long as the spot price stays below your bid you have significantly more instances available (<i>which should give your users better response times</i>). When the spot price rises your spot instances die and things slow down, but your app would still be alive thanks to the non spot instances. Again it takes quite a bit more engineering to get a setup like this but this is the kind of thing you need to do to take advantage of elastic computing.",1389411775

Here is a comment I left above.<p>What amazes me is that in this whole conversation no one even mentions the differences between men and women, as these differences were shaped by evolutionary forces. In all our attempts to make women and men &quot;equal&quot;, not just in this country, but across the world, women and men still go into different professions and do have different interests, and are good in their gender-specific things. There is a reason for that: men and women are different.\nSurely, there will be women in tech and men in nursing. But the differences are there and they go back hundreds of millions of years, and they&#x27;ve been shaped by real evolutionary forces, and they play out every day in myriads of ways.\nFor all the scorn that Harvard University President Lawrence Summers got in 2005 for bringing out these issues, he was coming from a serious scientifically-based view on differences of sexes.\nFor those who want to understand how evolution shaped women and men, I recommend to start with Dawkins&#x27; books (The Greatest Show on Earth, The Blind Watchmaker, The Selfish Gene), and then to read &quot;The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature&quot; by Matt Ridley, and &quot;The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature&quot; by Geoffrey Miller.\nAnd, hey, I am talking to the audience here, since it is mostly composed of men (there is a reason for it): understanding the evolution of sex will make you better at picking up women!",1389411622

I go to work every day, but my business, though profitable, isn&#x27;t large enough yet to hire. Of course, there are limits to what I can do as one person, so it&#x27;s likely that I will eventually hire.<p>This week and next, I&#x27;ve had a young man who I already knew helping me. The restaurant where he works is currently closed for two weeks, so I took that as an opportunity to give him a chance without either of us making any commitments. I already knew that he had a great attitude (well beyond his 20-year-old age), so this was more of a way to see how well he did in my line of work and to let him evaluate what I do and how I like to do things. For both of us, it was a way to confirm that we’d work well together.<p>In some areas, I&#x27;ve gone out of my way to accommodate him and his circumstances. I asked what he&#x27;s paid at his current job so I can pay him more than that (by percentage, a good amount, less so when viewed as an hourly rate). I talked through with him paying on a schedule that fit his needs (weekly, it turned out). I took him with me on deliveries to see how I handle customer relations. I had him come along when I spoke to a potential new customer, one that in his presence agreed to receive product from me. I&#x27;ve openly shared my expenses and revenues.<p>It&#x27;s articles like the one linked here, along with my own employment history, that taught me there are equitable and forthright ways of treating people.

But if so many people are leaving, demand should be decreasing and prices should be soft.</i><p>Housing has a few problems. One is that it&#x27;s price inelastic. If you destroyed 5% of the housing in Manhattan, prices and rents would at least double, and possibly go up 4-10x. We know this because of the 9/11 Boom (which was actually fueled by speculators anticipating future supply destruction-- which, thankfully, never came). It&#x27;s counterintuitive, but something that objectively destroys value can (with inelasticity) increase the bulk value of what&#x27;s out there. If 5% of housing was destroyed and prices doubled, most people would say that the housing market &quot;improved by 90%&quot;. Well, no.<p>Increasing housing prices are, make no mistake, signs of something bad. Supply problems (mostly, rooted in NIMBY regulations) are a big part of what&#x27;s going wrong. Another issue is that most localities are losing jobs, while a few &quot;star cities&quot; (SF, NYC) win.<p>The second problem with housing is that, because people are emotional about it, they don&#x27;t sell when there is cause for prices to go down. They <i>hoard</i>. This negative correlation between price and volume means that housing prices barely drop when they&#x27;re &quot;supposed to&quot;, but drop cataclysmically when the real estate problem starts destroying real wealth (as in 2008) and jobs disappear and foreclosures happen.<p>Real estate is the blood-engorged cancer of the economy.

The problem with all these free Google offerings is that they scare away potential startups but aren't really run like businesses so it doesn't matter if they actually solve the problem well or not. Swiftype is a great example of a startup doing pretty much exactly that. I can guarantee the average response to their idea was ""well, why not just use Google search.""<p>I can think of a few Google tools that could be done way better if a startup put a lot of effort into solving the problem better, like Google Groups which is nigh unusable due to spam and a crappy interface.",1336510280

Since then, I've been trying to either raise an angel round or find steady work.  Every start-up claims they're hiring.  In my experience, however, that's just not the case.  During this same period of time, I've witnessed no shortage of half-baked ideas raise all sorts of money.<p>But I understand the business aspects of why raising money is easier.  Hiring people means expenses for recruiting, training, payroll liabilities, and legal issues if the employee doesn't work out.  Raising money on the other hand is much more straight-forward; investors cut a check and the exact risk is the potential of losing the investment.<p>So my question to all of you is: Can we just conclude that its easier to raise money than find a job?",1336509643

3945610,comment,3943569,3943569,2,0,saurik,,,"> GOTCHA #3: THE APPLICATIONCACHE IS AN ADDITIONAL CACHE, NOT AT ALTERNATIVE ONE<p>This section is not quite true, at least for WebKit. This article states that the application cache will use the normal browser cache when making outgoing requests, honoring whatever cache control headers were sent by the server. What actually happens is that the browser always forces a revalidation of the content with the server, regardless of what the cache control headers that had been served.<p>Now, I certainly /wish/ it were the case that it honored the normal browser cache, but it simply doesn't. The result is that the application cache makes these outgoing requests painfully and arduously one-at-a-time, waiting for the previous one to entirely complete before making the next one... over a mobile data connection this takes /forever/, and it is quite possible that it simply does not finish by the time the process is aborted by one of these needless server requests failing or the window being closed.<p>Normally, you can mitigate these issues by sending files with ""cache this effectively forever"" headers and always using unique filenames, but with the application cache manifest system (which you are going to be using to support guaranteed-consisten offline operation) you are forced to wait for every request to resubmit before seeing the update.<p>Here is the code from WebKit's ApplicationCacheGroup.cpp, where you can see ""max-age=0"" being sent as Cache-Control for the outgoing requests. (Sending that header as a user-agent serves to ""force any intermediate caches to validate their copies directly with the origin server"", per RFC2616).<p><pre><code>    PassRefPtr<ResourceHandle> ApplicationCacheGroup::createResourceHandle(const KURL& url, ApplicationCacheResource* newestCachedResource)\n    {\n        ResourceRequest request(url);\n        m_frame->loader()->applyUserAgent(request);\n        request.setHTTPHeaderField(""Cache-Control"", ""max-age=0"");</code></pre>",1336508502

Having known people who were victims of ACH Fraud it makes you wonder where all those billions of fraud dollars/euros/etc go.<p>So unlike PayPal, these guys have investors/partners that are in fact financial institutions. Further, those institutions can no doubt provide things such as an account that is 'plugged in' to the financial infrastructure that is the world.<p>I can see no barrier at all to someone opening up an account with Viridian, depositing some money in it. And then using the Dwolla payments system to make payments too it and get money from it. That is all you need for one seller on Ebay, or Etsy, or whatever to set up their store.<p>Now if that person has any success at all, and I see no reason that the payment system would be any more of a barrier than the original use of PayPal with Ebay before Ebay sanctioned them was, then the payment stream will grow.<p>If Viridian goes from having 1.4B$ in assets to have 10 - 20 - 30B$ in assets because folks are creating accounts there to hold money for their endeavors, the other banks <i>will</i> notice, and the world <i>will</i> respond.

I would also be very shocked if DSCP has anything at all to do with the way Comcast is calculating your bandwidth cap.  They are most likely using something like IPDR or subscriber-aware DPI.<p>DSCP values also are completely separate from DOCSIS priority on the cable network.  With DOCSIS the provider can create service flows with different priorities and bandwidth restrictions.  Most providers only use two service flows (one upstream and one downstream) but if Comcast wanted to give some subset of traffic priority on the DOCSIS network (where they are most likely to see congestion) they would put that traffic into a separate service flow with a higher priority.   That is how they do their ""congestion management"" to top users, top users in saturated nodes get their service flow priority temporary and dynamically reduced (via PCMM) so other users traffic gets first shot at open time slots.<p>In addition, with DOCSIS 3 it is very possible for the MSO to add a dedicated set of RF channels that only select traffic would use, which in this case it would be the Xfinity video streams.  I have no idea if that is how Comcast has implemented this but if so how is that any different  to Video-On-Demand on a standard STB? With standard VOD on a STB there is a set of RF frequencies set aside for VOD use.  If they put Xfinity XBOX IP traffic on a separate RF channel it would be no different than adding an additional RF channel for VOD and would have zero impact on total available internet bandwidth to the cable node.",1336507783

It's the trend I've noticed where invariably someone says:  Blah Blah Blah, I'm so professional, blah blah blah, I'm a boss|manager|startup founder|etc blah blah blah and I'd fire you for this.<p>Edit:\nSeriously, the person with the potty-mouth might be an awesome developer and you'd be an idiot to not hire or fire them for being a little non-PC.  The swearing at least indicates some level of passion for their work, which is most likely a good thing.  Personally some of my best work was done on projects where I alternated between the occasional, but rare, out-loud 'fuck yeah!' and 'fuck you package x, why do you have to be this way?!'",1336507297

I don't think you appreciate how difficult it can be to provide care for some one with old age/dementia or a neurally degenerative disease like Parkinsons or Alzheimer's. Caregivers need more tools and this would be one that would help for some people. It wouldn't replace all the other things that you need to do as a Caregiver, technology is just another tool that can be used.<p>You do feel a great guilt and sadness watching someone you love slowly wither away over years. You are always thinking of ways to help but the hard reality is that there isn't a lot you can do except provide companionship.<p>But what do you do when you need a job to pay for all the other care this loved one needs? These things compete for your time and ability to provide companionship 24hrs/day. If I quit my job and moved across the country to take care of my father their wouldn't be any money to pay for the nurse's, medicine, and doctors. Plus all the other complexities of life that this would create for my wife and our plans to have a family. Caring for a sick person is complex.",1336507230

I don't think that happens by accident and without working extra at it -- at least, I didn't find a way to do that for myself.",1336507221

You're right that most people have never heard of that library, which is why the way you presented it will leave most people with no idea that it was an influence (even if they read that far). That's something you could have just said, in one sentence, without getting into detail about how it was different.<p>I'm not really trying to criticize you for saying or not saying certain things, and I don't think you did anything wrong.  Not really acknowledging influences is just a symptom of what turned me off. I feel like this post was written from a sort of aggressive fighting-for-popularity mindset that I'm uncomfortable with in a language.<p>EDIT: missing word",1336507202

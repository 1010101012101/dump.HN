Once a madman or idiot gets into power, decades or centuries of progress will be erased. One benefit of liberal democracy is that it's much more robust, relying on laws and traditions rather than the people running it. Look at how much damage the Bush Administration has done to the US.

For a lot of people the social life is a big part of it, the first part of life away from parents, but still with some security, and about intellectual exploration </i><p>It's funny, but I got a whole lot more of that stuff after dropping out. Am I really going to learn more from a place where I don't pay the rent, buy stuff with a meal card, work fifteen hours per week but don't necessarily have to show up, and am surrounded by proto-alcoholics? If you can deduce the modern college experience from any sane set of first principles, I'd like to hear about it -- but it seems to me that Murray is right. If we didn't have college, and you tried to invent it, you'd be rightly denounced as a loon.<p><i>And he puts too much faith in certification tests as ""classless"", in my opinion. I used to do test prep, and like most things, the people who have the money and the time to train for the certifications have an advantage.</i><p>Murray has crunched the numbers rather than counting the anecdotes; studying for the SAT can raise scores a lot at first, but if you studied two hours per day for 150 days, your expected score increase would be seventy points. Murray cites this (<a href=""http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ254150&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=EJ254150"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetai...</a>), which I haven't read.

275375,comment,274571,274645,0,0,biohacker42,,,"I am very skeptical about these interviews.<p>All I am ever interested in is a code sample. That will answer all coding questions. It can not even be compared to forcing a nervous candidate to code by writing on a white board. It also can not be compared to a quiz on topics in programming. Get a code sample, read it, ask a few questions about it, that is all.<p>As to if a person would ""fit' on a team, it takes roughly 3 seconds to figure that out. So have each team member meet with the candidate for 1 minute, that's plenty of time.<p>Then do a background check, call references and that's all there is to.<p>Everything else is just smoke and mirrors BS. It selects for people good at interviewing, not good hackers.<p>And lastly you can always fire people, if they lied about their code sample or whatever. So lets stop acting as if hiring someone is irreversible. In America at least, firing people is still easy.<p>There's one thing to note about large companies. Large companies can't trust one good developer to evaluate a code sample. So that's bad, and they then fall back on a day long dog and pony show. And then they usually have huge, ugly, crufty code bases, that means that they can't even tell if someone is good or bad until AFTER they grok the code base. And groking the code base often takes a LONG time. So to pay someone for months only to then fire them and start again is expensive.<p>And the moral of the story is: Stay away from big companies.",1218656925

College should train you for some sort of career and should do so in the most rigorously objective way possible. In this view, certifications provide the gold standard of objectivity.<p>2. College should help you become well rounded, responsible adults. By which I mean, able to reason about complex issues, having some background in history, science, philosophy, literature, the arts, a basic understanding of subjects that affect our lives, such as economics,  etc...

275365,comment,275258,275258,0,0,time_management,,,"College is an aspect of upper- and upper-middle-class life (formerly) that has replicated on account of the status and advantage once conferred by the college degree. Now it's a requirement for a large set of jobs, most of which wouldn't even be considered desirable.<p>Is college a massive waste of time and money for a lot of people? Probably. I think it's useless and unfair to put a person through college and then have him end up in a job that does not involve the level of autonomy and intellectual challenge that college led him to expect. Since society has not evolved to the point where good jobs are abundant, it's hard to see any good reason for more than 5-10% of people to have college educations.<p>One has to examine the motivations behind the proliferation of higher education. The far left supports widespread college education under the belief that if lower- and middle-class people have the benefit of a liberal education, they'll demand good jobs and become ""Angry Young (Wo/)Men"" if they don't get them and, therefore, evolve into revolutionaries who will overthrow the status quo. The corporate right likes it because the colleges provide companies with a sorting mechanism, the costs of which are paid by the people being sorted rather than the corporate ""users"". The center supports widespread college education under the guise of increasing social equality. It's obvious that an idea with such support from both the wings and the center will be implemented.<p>Also, there are the goals of the academics. In the 1950s, professors widely believed that a merger between the academy and the larger capitalistic society would improve their social position. As they saw it, rule of society by educational institutions seemed to be the next logical step after rule by the church until the Enlightenment, by governments up to World War I, and finally by business corporations in the XX-c. They got their desired ""merger"" but Mammon, being larger and meaner, won and turned the academy to its needs, rather than vice versa.",1218656375

The Regional Security Officer (RSO) estimates the current number of murders at the end of 2007 to be approximately eight. All murder cases for the period have been solved. Reported incidents of rape increased for this period to 70 cases, compared to 53 cases during the same period in 2006. Motor vehicle theft and snatch theft incidents increased 25 percent during the first half of 2007. Housebreaking incidents for the first half of 2007 declined ten percent. The “outraging of Modesty,” a Singaporean crime pertaining to unwanted sexual touching, is reported to have increased a negligible amount.""<p>Twelve murders per year, in a city of 4.5 million people! New York City, a little over twice as big, is bragging that their murder rate is under 500 for the first time in decades. They are bragging that you are only 2000% more likely to get stabbed, strangled, shot or beaten to death in NYC than in Singapore.<p>The fairest analogy is that Singapore is run the way a private business would run a nation-state. Private property maximizes the rent they can collect from their residents, but political freedom is pretty worthless. Google doesn't let users determine their search algorithm, and won't even bow down when they accidentally link to something reprehensible (Google ""Jew"", for example). If someone wants to switch, they can switch to Yahoo!<p>It's instructive that it is so much cheaper to leave Singapore than to leave the US -- Singapore is a pretty small city, and there are plenty of other small, English-speaker-friendly places in the area. If the cost of switching governments got as low as the cost of switching search engines, you'd expect the quality of government to approach that of online search -- Singapore is a great example of what you get when you move along that continuum.",1218656191

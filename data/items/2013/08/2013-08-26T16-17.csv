What are the relevant demography-adjusted statistics? There are certainly some (edit: sub-)cultural aspects, but every culture has some aspects of the negative traits you cite (e.g. most people tend to disdain out-group achievement). These traits are often drastically accentuated by poverty. In the case of black Americans, doubly so by the compounding effects of high urbanization levels.",1377536386

It&#x27;s easier to get when it&#x27;s an occupation underwriters really understand.  For instance a surgeon can easily get an occupation-specific policy because it would be easy to determine that damage to her hands would cause her to lose her income producing work.<p>It&#x27;s harder to get a similar policy for say, an entrepreneur.  What part of our body allows us to do what we do?<p>Thus, most startups that get a policy have to get the 2nd type--if you can work elsewhere after an injury, you don&#x27;t qualify.  There&#x27;s one addendum, however, that is still crucial.  You can get a policy that requires the new job have a similar income level.  Thus, if you were only able to do work at a 70% decrease in salary, the policy would be triggered and you&#x27;d receive your benefit.",1377536286

The &#x27;facts&#x27; of what-counters-what don&#x27;t matter too much; it&#x27;s the feedback mechanism that matters. When you see Player 2 do X, you use that info to play the best Y. Good scouting decreases this feedback timing, and the player that iterates better will, given enough time, come out on top.<p>In SC2, there&#x27;s a spectrum of <i>usefulness</i> to information. Finding a proxy pylon is hard, but screams intention. Scouting early double gas is easy, perhaps, but is more clouded. In chess, all the positions of the pieces are obvious (no concept of scouting), but <i>all</i> the information is clouded beneath layers of moves-after-moves. A very powerful attack can be hidden in plain sight.<p>In this more general context of iterative gathering & analyzing of information in pursuit of a victory condition, I can see how it applies. The fact that the general mechanism (however it works, exactly) can be exercised through a specific game is still intriguing.",1377536244

6278220,comment,6276171,6278069,2,0,nitid_name,,,">The right answer to all of your questions is, &quot;it depends&quot;. For example, a society where everyone is completely free but dies at the age of 5 is not really worth living in, nor is a society where everyone lives to 100 as a slave. Thus there is no one answer to &quot;Is life more important than liberty?&quot;<p>I think you&#x27;re missing the point.<p>The followup question to &quot;It depends&quot; is &quot;On what?&quot; The answer to that question is where commonality begins to form. We might not agree on the exchange rate between freedom and life expectancy, but we will likely agree that there is one.<p>It reminds me of an old joke:<p>A man asks a woman if she&#x27;d sleep with him for a million dollars. She looks him up and down, smiles, and says &quot;sure.&quot; He then asks her if she&#x27;d do it for a dollar. She slaps him, asking what sort of girl he thinks she is.

6278219,comment,6274916,6276791,1,0,millstone,,,"Yes, that&#x27;s an ill-formed string. As I wrote, there&#x27;s a long ways to go from a &quot;sequence of valid code units&quot; to &quot;a valid string.&quot;<p>But what I wrote is nevertheless correct, and matters. See for example the special requirements on UTF-8 processing in D93:<p><pre><code>    If the converter encounters an ill-formed UTF-8
    code unit sequence...it must not consume the
    successor bytes as part of the ill-formed
    subsequence whenever those successor bytes
    themselves constitute part of a well-formed UTF-8
    code unit subsequence....For a UTF-8 conversion
    process to consume valid successor bytes is not
    only non-conformant, but also leaves the converter
    open to security exploits.&quot;
</code></pre>
&quot;Ill-formed code unit sequence&quot; is not possible with UTF-16. That&#x27;s an advantage. Also note the last line: the existence of ill-formed code units has security implications that are not present with UTF-16.<p>To be fair, UTF-16 has its own unique issues too, like endianness.",1377536199

He dislikes companies/businesses charging him more than he thinks things are worth, while simultaneously being one of the strongest free-market capitalist supporters in my social circle.

Not just asking for a pat down rather than the scanner (if I gave myself more time at the airport I&#x27;d likely do the same), but to the point of abusing the worker rather than making the system itself slow down. Also, he has little regard for those behind him in line, and doesn&#x27;t mind delaying them a few minutes so he can feel better about himself.<p>As I haven&#x27;t spent much time with him (physically parted ways after college) the past few years I can&#x27;t really recall any more specific incidents, but it was a reason that, in college, it took us about 6 months to become friends.

You could expose animals to the same doses of radiation and see what happens. This has been done for the general types of radiation (with X-rays animals contract cancers and die at sufficiently high power, with millimeter waves there&#x27;s substantially less evidence for damage), but AFAIK not with the machines themselves.<p>The biggest danger may not come from chronic exposure, but from an acute failure of the machine or mistake made by the operator, the probability of which could not be determined in a study anyway. (Therac-25 delivered overdoses of radiation to several patients due to a software bug; Cedars-Sinai recently reported that they had accidentally delivered dozens of CT patients doses several times higher than normal; patients get killed by oxygen tanks and other objects sucked into the magnetic fields of MRIs with startling frequency.)<p>In any case, I think the danger posed by millimeter wave systems is significantly less than that of backscatter machines. There are plenty of studies to show that microwaves don&#x27;t cause cancer, and it&#x27;s hard to imagine a malfunctioning machine delivering something harmful.",1377536133

According to most proponents of this theory this likely would involve the development of a super intelligence far removed from anything we know today.)<p>I&#x27;m fairly young so I frequently fantasize that humanity will make incredible leaps forward within my lifetime. I can&#x27;t help but dream that most of our problems will be solved in a matter of decades. I have held this belief for most of my short existence, but I am now starting to have doubts.<p>The main problem is that technology doesn&#x27;t seem to be progressing as fast as it should. Sure, we have a new smartphone model every six months, but what about more fundamental long term research that doesn&#x27;t have immediate commercial applications? I don&#x27;t have enough information or scientific education to determine whether we are heading in the right direction. However it does seem that A.I. and genetic manipulation research is evolving at a snail&#x27;s pace.<p>A lesser but perhaps even more depressing problem is that belief in the singularity itself is starting to look awkwardly like a form of religion:<p>1) A belief in a second, better life in the future whose nature is incomprehensible to &quot;mortals&quot;.<p>2) A small evidence/speculation ratio<p>3) Worship (in this case, technology or those who create it)<p>4) A &quot;chosen few&quot; mentality.  (For example, the singularity benefitting only scientists or people who saw it coming and planned accordingly i.e. Kurzweil taking 40 pills a day to live long enough) This is extremely common in internet discussions around the subject. I had this same attitude myself until recently, patting myself on the back for being &quot;in the know&quot;.<p>So do you think it is stupid to believe in the singularity? Am I delusional?

When I was an HSBC customer in college a few years back, I had disabled overdrafting because I did not want to receive overdraft fees and, in a pinch, I could use a credit card if my charge was declined.<p>One day I checked my account and discovered that I had accrued a number of overdraft fees. Apparently sometimes merchants (namely gas stations) will put a temporary charge of a dollar against your credit card, then later correct the charge to the correct price. This caused my account to overdraft as HSBC didn&#x27;t deny the correction, then with my account overdrafted as of the date in question, all subsequent valid charges I had done against the account assuming a one dollar gas charge were made as overdraft charges. Contacting customer service and reminding them that I had in fact disabled overdraft was not enough to convince them of anything other than giving me a one-time partial credit of fees, so I switched banks.<p>I don&#x27;t know if that is still how things are done over at HSBC, but ultimately the point is that disabling overdrafting is not some panacea for the problem, as ultimately there are situations that can still get you in trouble.",1377535516

Thom Hogan among others has written about this extensively.<p>The example I gave was of a long-time professional photographer that now uses EVFs exclusively and says they are both the future and much better than traditional viewfinders.<p>>EVFs have numerous shortcomings, and most of their advantages are already available on high-end DSLRs with live view technologies. EVF is not great, and not even your linked article says it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s just something photographers have to live with to get the lower cost and smaller size of mirrorless cameras.<p>The A77 and A99 are direct counterexamples to that. They cost the same as their competitors and have the same size. Those are the cameras in the example I linked so at least that one pro didn&#x27;t go in looking for cheaper or smaller.<p>>As I&#x27;ve already said, I have no doubt the DSLR market share will shrink. Where we part ways is whether this means incumbents like Canon and Nikon are going to get put out of business by electronic companies like Sony and Samsung.<p>I don&#x27;t think Canon and Nikon are going out of business, I just think this is the classic Innovator Dilemma situation where the new technology that is considered inferior ends up dominating. After all the current crop of companies are the result of the long evolution of the 35mm standard. Initially that was the low-end to take advantage of cheap movie film, no match for the medium and large format serious stuff... The same way Hasselblad is still in business but mostly irrelevant I fear Nikon and Canon will be that way in 20 years if they don&#x27;t innovate along with the market.",1377535393

Rather, there&#x27;s a strong appreciation for the sensitivity national security stories inherently possess amongst traditional journalists. Often, these stories could cause war, regime collapse, and loss of life in ways remote and unconsidered by the journalist.<p>The ad-hoc system worked out by United States media outlets is to approach government officials prior to publication of certain sensitive stories. If anything could seriously damage national security or cause immediate loss of life, the officials will lobby the newspapers to remove certain pieces of information.<p>In most circumstances, journalists only agree to these edits when there is both immediate danger to specific persons, usually military or intelligence assets, that would be caused by the information, <i>and</i> the information requested to be redacted is ancillary to subject of the story.<p>The reason so many in the media have had a viscerally negative reaction to Assange and Snowden is that they completely ignored this delicate back and forth, skipping straight to full scale publication. In essence, they did not follow the  media establishment&#x27;s rules for responsible journalistic disclosure.<p>The actions taken against The Guardian by the UK government marked a real sea change in the way the United States media is treating this story. Going after Greenwald? Sure, he was fair game, just a blogger with little to no editorial oversight from the paper that bore his brand.<p>But The Guardian is a full-fledged newspaper, and most certainly not fair game. United States journalists are now scared stiff. Smashing those hard drives suddenly invoked the narrative of attempted control and oppression that every professional journalist had drilled into them for years at university.<p>The blowback was immediate, swift, and severe. The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post all plastered stories to their front pages about Miranda&#x27;s detention within a few minutes. Overnight editors shifted their attitudes, and opinion pieces like this one spiked. Most significantly, The New York Times is now spearheading a series of stories based upon the Snowden disclosures, which will likely become the definitive investigation. This shift will take time to trickle down, since American establishment journalism is very elite-mediated, but the impact will be massive.",1377535333

The French monarchy, one of the most advanced states in the world, relied on the <i>corve</i> to build roads up until 1789 [1]. The decisive turn in the situation took place in Holland around the 16th century, when Dutch cities discovered they could build canals and recoup costs by charging moderate usage fees. This system of financing civil engineering, adapted to e.g. turnpikes and later railroads, increasingly became widespread, and displaced earlier arrangements in Western countries during the 18th and 19th centuries.

They lack essential properties that a scientific theory most have, primarily falsifiability, but including the ability to predict observations not yet made, and the ability to produce consensus -- accepted principles -- among different workers in the same field. Psychologists and psychiatrists famously disagree on even the most basic things. Tom Widiger, who served as head of research for DSM-IV, says &quot;There are lots of studies which show that clinicians diagnose most of their patients with one particular disorder and really don&#x27;t systematically assess for other disorders. They have a bias in reference to the disorder that they are especially interested in treating and believe that most of their patients have.&quot;<p>> And while there is more to science than publishing descriptions, it is still part of science.<p>Not without falsifiable theories. Remember that falsifiability -- a practical way to compare ideas to reality and abandon ideas that fail the test -- is essential to science.<p>The difference between psychology and astrology is that astrology has clearly stated theories, theories that have been tested and found wanting.",1377534370

But when I look at this map it is very hard to draw the assumption that Chicago is incredibly segregated.  Looking at this map you could easily say white people live here african american live here and asian / hispanic live here etc... But it is much deeper then the top overview. Chicago has a huge polish , german, irish community. I&#x27;m talking about people who have moved from their home country to live in the US. I notice a trend that when polish people move to chicago they move to where polish people live not any old &quot;white&quot; neighborhood they move to a place where they feel comfortable and have common ground.  Never in my life have I or the city say white people need to live here and african american live here. There must be a reason that Chinese live on the south side Vietnamese live on the north side and Korean live on the further north side. Latino is the same. I forgot where i was going with this point.

This article appears not to have been submitted before, but we have had other discussions here about the Inca empire and its conquest by the Spanish.<p>The submitted article correctly notes that the history of the Inca empire is fragmentary because of a severe lack of written sources. Archeology is a poor substitute for history (relying on actual written records from the time studied) because it is hard to figure out what people were thinking. The rather rapid conquest of the Inca empire by a badly outnumbered group of Spanish explorers surely relied most on the epidemic diseases that the Spaniards inadvertently brought with them, but it appears to have relied as well on dissatisfaction with Inca rule on the part of many Inca subjects. People don&#x27;t fight hard against invaders if their &quot;home&quot; rulers are dictators--World War II provides other examples of that principle. Maybe the greatest mystery of the Inca empire is that it lasted any length of time at all. The empire collapsed rapidly once a new, tiny group of potential rulers arrived. South America&#x27;s Andean territories soon became viceroyalties of Spain, far away.",1377532975

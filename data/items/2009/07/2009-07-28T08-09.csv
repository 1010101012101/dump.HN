727628,comment,726942,726942,0,0,robk,,,"Google already had written this off as a defensive cost to be sure.  There's never been a surprise about this deal not being, prima facie, a good equity investment.  However since it's been publicly traded, losing three points of market share would have had a much more material effect on the market cap, such that this made perfect sense to do.<p>As for how much it generated, I'll bet it was breakeven.  Assume Google had a 90/10 or 85/15 revshare with AOL, so Google made maybe $100M-$150M off this deal if the prior three years' numbers are correct above.",1248771369

Having the fabricate system take input like that and do parallel execution is as hard as solving the halting problem.",1248770885

And while Django tags are quite easy to implement, there is a problem that they are completely inconsistent because you need to parse input string yourself.<p>Jinja tags are harder to grok, but after that they are starting to make sense.",1248770677

727622,comment,726728,727523,0,0,olavk,,,"The article does point out scientifically based refutations of some simplistic eve-psych explanations rape, abuse of stepchildren and so on. Doesn't your point about the motives of feminism and liberalism use political name-calling to counter the scientific arguments?<p>I agree that evo-psych in general is an interesting field - and certainly all human behavior is somehow rooted in evolution. So of course rape also have some kind direct or indirect evolutionary explanation, just as love, music, wine-tasting, pole-sitting and so on. But the explanation is probably a lot more complex than ""rape helps spread genes"".<p>Pop-evo-psych have gotten great exposition in the popular media lately, so it is quite refreshing to see a debunking.",1248770368
727621,comment,727602,727602,0,0,jacquesm,,,"My first guess on how to proceed would be to find some other parties that have already signed on to this program and to ask them what these tersm mean in practice.<p>regarding the first term:<p>That one seems to be the most serious, why they would want a seat at the table in negotiations is hard for me to understand. What I don't see is the teeth this contract has in case you do not live by its terms in the long run. What recourse do they have if you decide to negotiate a deal on your own ?<p>as to the second part:<p>It sounds like the reporting requirements are quite heavy for something that is basically government supported cheap business space.<p>Figure out how much it will cost you to comply with these requirements and how much you will save because of being in the program (and there might be fringe benefits).<p>Another avenue would be to take on some angel funding and use that to rent your office space but that will cost you equity and may not come with the same networking possibilities.<p>It reads like they want more statistics on what is going on inside the businesses they have a contract with, which is typical for government services, it is one of the coins with which you are expected to pay them back.<p>It is very well possible that you will be making these reports anyhow (for yourself or your co-founders or for some other funding entity), in that case the overhead would be minimal.<p>good luck!",1248770325

Now he has proof!<p>Coldfusion has everything bad about PHP, but without any of the ease brought by popularity, the cheap hosting, the instant deployment, the extensibility with native modules, the piles of open source code (or implementations), or even people controlling it that still care.

In reality Erlang syntax is very simple and consistent, here you have most of it: <a href=""http://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/expressions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/expressions.html</a><p>I don&#x27;t understand people who refuse to learn unfamiliar syntaxes at all. A syntax is only bad if it matches semantics poorly, for example in JavaScript you create functions very often, for various purposes, yet syntax for this is rather verbose, which may hurt readability by obscuring what&#x27;s really going on. In case of Erlang the syntax supports the semantics quite well. For example, sending async messages between processes is central part of the language and accordingly has lightweight syntax, essentially: &quot;Target ! SomeMessage&quot;. It&#x27;s also highly consistent, for example guard patterns in functions have exactly the same syntax as guards in &quot;if&quot; expressions; destructuring has the same syntax no matter where it&#x27;s done, in funcion definition, case statement or inline with &quot;=&quot; operator. And so on.<p>In general you should try to understand the syntax and underlying semantics before saying anything about it.",1422179386

8942513,comment,8941756,8942493,0,0,otis_inf,,,"You&#x27;re new to writing software? Because after 20+ years in the trenches, it can become second nature to you. The thing is: to get from A to B is a journey you can perform in a million different ways. When you&#x27;re new, and young, such a journey is an adventure: what shall we meet along the way? Who knows! Let&#x27;s find out! The more experienced you get, the more you know which things to avoid, what to do to get certain things done and how to make things easier for yourself and others. That also means that a journey from A to B isn&#x27;t an adventure anymore, it&#x27;s a carefully planned expedition, because you _know_ that by not carefully planning it, you&#x27;ll hurt yourself and perhaps won&#x27;t make it to B.<p>This means that all the fun of exploring and adventuring to get from A to B is more or less gone, as you already know what lies ahead and how to avoid it. You _know_ what&#x27;s coming and thus how to deal with it. You also _know_ which parts are a chore and can suck the energy right out of you. This alone can make a journey that would otherwise be fun, a problematic undertaking we probably would like to avoid if we had the chance.<p>The post absolutely doesn&#x27;t state you should avoid crap, it also doesn&#x27;t state one can achieve greatness without avoiding mess and misery. It just writes about by learning a lot over the years the adventure of a journey from A to B is fading away and with it, the fun and excitement.<p>The post hit home with me a great deal as it perfectly answered why I didn&#x27;t code on a Saturday anymore (e.g. silly stuff like a small game or tiny tools), but only program software during work days and only for work: it wasn&#x27;t a problem to find ideas to write a silly program for, it was the baggage that came with it as I already knew I had to do X and Y to get started properly, Z to get something on the screen, get a lib for E and F and as I knew that would likely be a chore I wouldn&#x27;t even start, as: why bother with chores on a free Saturday if you can have some fun?<p>It&#x27;s still possible though, don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all grim and gloomy and dark, you just have to put what you _think_ up front what could happen aside and still do it. You&#x27;ll learn it isn&#x27;t so bad, but sadly the fun of adventuring and exploring into new territory is often not there anymore, simply because it&#x27;s familiar territory. That&#x27;s often a good thing in life, but if it&#x27;s adventure and excitement filled exploration is what you&#x27;re after like all those years ago, you&#x27;re not going to find it (easily).<p>Cheers :)",1422179111

If the software is old to the point that nobody fully understands it any more, and previous maintainers have left the company, the number of production lines of code added per day may easily be lower than 5.<p>Older code has a lot more functionality, so every line of code is capable of leveraging more. 5 lines of code in a mature system may do more than 500 lines in a new system. But a bigger factor is figuring out which 5 lines to write. A third of the time can easily be spent researching the code trying to figure out a plan of attack, and the remainder iteratively debugging different variations of 5 lines validating (or invalidating) assumptions made about the code&#x27;s emergent design during the planning phase.<p>And I&#x27;m not counting test code.

In this case, you&#x27;d be better off allocating 2<i></i>x-h each time.<p>Of course, modern allocators tend to store accounting information using separately reserved arrays of records to avoid exactly this problem. But if you use a language like C# or Java, you come back to around to this problem. Without using a double indirection for array data, object header and array length are stored contiguously with array data. So allocating an array with a power of two will again not be a power of two for the underlying allocator. Much less of a problem with precise GC, but not all GC&#x27;d languages use precise moving GC, and some languages let you pin arrays for interop with C.

Because to me a REPL that includes the usual bells and whistles (code reloading, good autocomplete, fast startup) along with job control, the ability to connect to remote systems, and being uncrashable is a whole lot better than &quot;shit,&quot; and in my experience is miles ahead of, say, `lein repl` or even the wonderful IPython.<p><pre><code>  > I don&#x27;t think the rest of the world goes out of their\n  > way to find awesome uses.\n</code></pre>\n&quot;Handbook of Neuroevolution Through Erlang&quot; disagrees. Indeed, that book&#x27;s author claims that Erlang is <i>the</i> language for representing &quot;thinking&quot; systems.<p><pre><code>  > its inability to market itself as letting you move\n  > faster and break more things.\n</code></pre>\nHuh? That&#x27;s the core of Erlang&#x27;s value proposition from what I&#x27;ve seen and any &quot;marketing&quot; efforts focus on Erlang&#x27;s robustness (that said, nobody should be specifically championing &quot;break more things&quot;). Going way back into Erlang&#x27;s history you can find &quot;Erlang, the Movie,&quot; and writings by Armstrong that emphasize hot code reloading, the system&#x27;s ability to recover from any error, and the VM&#x27;s support for incremental improvements in software without downtime.<p><pre><code>  > environments that get people &quot;most of the way there&quot;\n  > without having to learn a totally alien ecosystem ...\n  > Erlangers will argue that with Go or Scala you may get\n  > some of the features of Erlang, you don&#x27;t get the whole\n  > package.\n</code></pre>\nSystems you mention like Go and Scala have their own considerable strengths, but they&#x27;re just not comparable for the applications at which Erlang excels: Highly reliable, low-latency (soft realtime) systems written at a high level. At the same time, Erlang is <i>slow</i> and provides none of the assurances a statically-typed language offers. I can&#x27;t imagine an experienced engineer seriously considering Go for a project that requires Erlang&#x27;s strengths, or vice-versa.<p>What I gather from all of this is that Erlang isn&#x27;t a fit for your high-throughput data processing application(s), and that you&#x27;ve somehow conflated this with a &quot;marketing&quot; failure on Erlang&#x27;s part or that Erlang&#x27;s goals are not focused. But Armstrong&#x27;s message about what Erlang is good for has remained consistent for decades now.<p>As an aside, if your Ruby/JS guys didn&#x27;t take to Erlang, I&#x27;m not sure why you expect to get far with Scala. Go seems quite popular with the Ruby crowd and sounds like a strong fit for what you&#x27;re doing.",1422177699

At WWDC they pitched it as production-ready but the truth is that even today it is seriously unfinished. It doesn&#x27;t even support incremental compilation and the tooling is still very fragile. I&#x27;d strongly recommend anybody new to iOS to start with ObjC for now. You need to at least be able to read ObjC to understand the APIs and all of the sample code out there and it&#x27;s still overall a more productive environment.<p>I don&#x27;t think any of Swift&#x27;s current problems are unfixable but I&#x27;d give it another year or so at least to mature.",1422177424

If it fails to reach one, try the other.<p>When you mention low latency, how low are we talking? ms, seconds, minutes? The reason I am asking is because you can use s3 as an intermediate storage where you ship your compressed logs/events at a rollover interval and the processing servers discover them there. Now of course this only works if latency is not a big deal.",1422177054

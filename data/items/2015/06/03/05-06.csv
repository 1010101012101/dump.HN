9650805,comment,9650289,9650727,0,0,fpgeek,,,"> 2. Not sure why you are comparing App Store with Amazon when Apple has an equivalent: the Apple Online Store. It does have physical products and has to deal with figuring out shipping across multiple regions. It&#x27;s actually comparable to Amazon since they both use the microtransactions approach to billing.<p>Are you serious? The idea that Apple&#x27;s online store is even vaguely comparable to Amazon in terms of complexity is just laughable. To start with, Amazon sells essentially everything Apple&#x27;s store does - plus millions of other products too. And unlike Apple, they&#x27;re tracking a wide variety of promotions and offers over those millions of products. Then we can talk about all the third-party providers that also sell via Amazon. And how many orders of magnitude more difficult Amazon&#x27;s search problem is. Not to mention Amazon&#x27;s recommendation engine. Or the order of magnitude more online users and transactions (Apple&#x27;s user base is in the same ballpark, but how many of them buy online vs in-store or via a retailer or carrier?). And on and on.",1433311110

Here you go, first result from Google search: <a href=""https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4408578?start=0&tstart=0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4408578?start=0&tstart=...</a>. Problem starts in 2012, still going end of 2014. 50,000 views. My current issue with iMessages is the completely random behavior of whether my computer or phone will get the message. Before iMessage it was pretty deterministic, now its like a game! The frequent solution is to text my iMessage email AND phone number, so then I&#x27;m in a group message with myself.<p>Its dead simple because other services seem to have figured this out. Twitter does actual real time systems, and its not 1-to-1. Slack meanwhile seems to have no trouble delivering me messages. iMessage however is the outlier here, maybe because they don&#x27;t live and die on this system like the others I mentioned. If you&#x27;re going to make a new system to replace the old one (text messages), make sure it works first.<p>2. The comparison is because it is a strictly easier problem and they still do strictly worse. If you want to compare Apple Online Store to Amazon Online Store, the report card is equally bad: imagine if every time Amazon added a new major product they took the ENTIRE STORE DOWN FOR HOURS.<p>3. It seems to me that iCloud is the thing that is more like &quot;just a drive&quot;. Google has Photos, Calendars, and email too, so I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re referring to with all this Google comparison. 5GB is kind of nothing when we start talking photos and email, and Google actually does cool stuff with my Photos, and Dropbox still hilariously feels more integrated with the OS than iCloud, not to mention having integration with other services.<p>The truth of the matter is that they do bare minimum on all their services, which is FINE btw -- just absurd to claim they have any special competence in the area. Nothing about their services stands out, with each one its literally one step above nothing which would be unacceptable. With email they NEED some basic email to give you with your devices. With the App Store they NEED some way for you to get apps. With the online store they NEED some way for you to order products.<p>Now compare Apple to Apple (ha): look at their absolutely, everyone agrees, <i>stellar</i> physical stores. Thats something to write home about. Look at their amazing supply chain where they can replace or fix a phone in hours -- truly surprising every time I go in. This is something they have clear core competency in.",1433310726

Being the guinea pig (or crusader) isn&#x27;t fun.  While people like Peter Thiel, who graduated from Stanford 2x, pontificate about the outdatedness of education, note that before becoming a billionaire he leveraged his education to earn serious money and experience in respected careers that unanimously goto college graduates: finance & law. This gave him the financial foundation & creditability to invest in Max Levchin and ultimately run PayPal.<p>The same opportunities are not offered in our society to people who graduate from top 10 universities vs drop out from the average American university.  The latter will have to prove themselves 5x more to compete for the same opportunities - whether it is jobs, capital, co-founders, or even dating.  Theres nearly no statistically likely argument where dropping out leads to better outcomes for the typical HN user over the long run across almost any metric.<p>2) Wait till you want to change careers or move into senior management to earn more money.  Want an MBA so you can double your salary for the next 25 years?  Want to become a teacher or a professor?  How about a lawyer.  Great, now take a bunch of classes with 18 y.o. know-it-alls and earn zero money for 4 extra years of undergrad tacked onto grad school when your opportunity cost is literally $500k (just for undergrad).<p>I fought the good fight, and the lesson is it&#x27;s generals and politicians who win wars, not soldiers.",1433309636

9650753,comment,9650165,9650337,0,0,electronvolt,,,"> College partially helped dictate the direction but why should I be paying 100,000 grands for just directions ?<p>In general, I agree with your sentiment:  the best learning is done when you aren&#x27;t being pressured by anyone other than yourself to do it, and at this point the sticker price for college is well out of wack of any value it could provide to students who aren&#x27;t able to use the credential it provides to line up a high paying job or who aren&#x27;t coming from very well off families.<p>I do think, however, that there are things that it is hard to teach yourself, and that a college or college-like situation (i.e. where you have a few months to study a small set of subjects without regards to your immediate output and in the presence of other people who are studying those subjects) is probably going to be the best or only environment for providing.<p>The first thing that I think it&#x27;s very hard to teach yourself is how to approach problems in a field at a high level.  For instance:  I doubt I would have been able to get myself to my current proficiency (roughly &#x27;beginning phd student&#x27;) in mathematical proofs without a lot of work with a professor and graders.  The material gets to a point where it becomes too hard to approach with your current mental toolbox, and I found that I usually needed some guidance if I was going to get myself to the next &#x27;level&#x27; persay.<p>The other thing that I found valuable and think is hard to find outside of a college was learning what problems fields other than your own find interesting, and how they approach those problems.  I found that some of the most valuable experiences for me in college were taking upper level courses in subjects I didn&#x27;t have a lot of experience in, particularly when those courses largely consisted of reading papers/books that were aimed at other scholars in that field, with a professor giving us context to the conversation that those papers and books were part of and a classwide discussion of the ideas presented.  What I got out of those courses was an understanding of how ideas developed and what tools fields would draw on and apply to supporting or refuting those ideas.  That was incredibly valuable to me because each course like that which I took gave me an entirely new toolbox for looking at the world and what&#x27;s in it.  (Sometimes I also wasn&#x27;t super fond of that toolbox, and that was also enlightening.)  This approach to learning wasn&#x27;t confined to the soft sciences/humanities, either, although it seems to kick in sooner in those fields:  graduate computer science and math seminars use an almost identical model.<p>I think both of these can largely be categorized by &quot;it&#x27;s hard to teach yourself how to think.&quot;<p>I think the first example is something where I at least needed the help of an instructor and grader to really grok it.  It&#x27;s things like that which I think you need some sort of college setting to really truly learn.<p>The second could maybe be moved to online courses, and I know some OCW materials have that kind of feel to them (particularly for graduate courses) but I think it would require a different approach to the courses.  Online courses often seem to focus on imparting the material, rather than about teaching about the process of how the material came to be.  The courses involved a certain amount of discussion that was (sometimes) just as valuable as the actual reading and surrounding clarification that I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d get at all with most of the current iterations online courses.",1433309516

Then there are the SAT subject tests, which cost less ($30?) but it&#x27;s not uncommon for a student looking to get into a selective school to take >3 subject tests.\nThen, maybe the student needs to retake the SAT, which is pretty standard, so add another ~$50 dollars and now we&#x27;re looking at several hundred dollars in exams. This isn&#x27;t counting the $50-100 application fee per school. Having a professor interview applicants would still be impossibly expensive of course. Do you happen to know how well the alumni interviews work? I never had one, but if I understand correctly, they are a part of Ivy League tier applications where a graduate of the school deems if the applicant would be a good fit. I&#x27;ve heard there&#x27;s not much weight placed on them, however.<p>I personally think the SATs are better indicators of socio-economic standing than scholastic aptitude, but agree that there&#x27;s probably nothing better. I kind of wish that the application process was similar to that for graduate school, where there&#x27;s more weight placed on the relevant subject test and letters of recommendation.",1433308243

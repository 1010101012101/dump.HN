10322784,comment,10320551,10320551,0,0,gabbo,,,"Fixed-interval + jitter can work, exponential + jitter can work too. Be super careful with retries that don&#x27;t involve jitter, depending on your system architecture you may end up with highly correlated bursts of retry load. You need to be careful of intermediate levels in your system when retrying. And be able to reason about what&#x27;s going to happen under common failure modes (you won&#x27;t able to anticipate the rare ones or freak occurrences, but you can defend in depth as best as you can).<p>If a low-level dependency starts to flake out (bad code/config/data push, unreliable host or network, load spike causing your storage to melt), retrying at intermediate stages can amplify the load and turn a small/medium-sized problem into a cascading failure. You can partially mitigate by retrying 0 or 1 times and then just give up, especially if you control all your callers or can afford that flakiness in your error budget.<p>Otherwise, depending on your needs you could maintain a retry budget (don&#x27;t unless you really know you need it): instead of a flat K retries before giving up, enforce a process-wide per-operation cap on your retry rate. When the system is healthy, overall retry rate will be low so you have &quot;room&quot; to issue all K retries if needed. But if your load spikes, or your downstream dependencies start flaking out for some reason (your &quot;fault&quot; or otherwise), you&#x27;ll avoid a positive feedback loop of death by quickly hitting your retry rate cap and shedding load which only would have made things worse and was destined to fail anyway.<p>EDIT: A few other remarks:<p>* OP&#x27;s general point about putting limits on everything is really important, and closely related to the general wisdom in distributed systems development: everything can and will fail, so make the failure modes obvious and explicit. You get general robustness by avoiding runaway queries, but you also force discussions at design/development time like &quot;what happens when this queue fills up&quot; or &quot;what happens if you&#x27;re never able to take that lock&quot; (though you should try to avoid needing to take locks ;)<p>* Instrument the hell out of the paths through your system and add lots of metrics. Logging is great, do it wherever it makes sense and you can, but a lot of the time you&#x27;ll be able to get more insight (or the same amount of insight with less time spent doing ad-hoc log analytics) with something simple like counters whose value you can track over time and plot on a graph somewhere. Examples: classify downstream dependency latency into buckets, count of times you hit a code path (maybe some users require a more complex DB query than others or you&#x27;re coding defensively, never expect a case to happen, but want to know if it does), cache hit rate, top sources of traffic in your system. Eventually you&#x27;ll want to optimize bottlenecks and without data to identify them and prove they&#x27;re fixed, you&#x27;re flying blind.",1443851888

Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333 (2011), is a legal dispute that was decided by the United States Supreme Court.[1][2] On April 27, 2011, the Court ruled, by a 5–4 margin, that the Federal Arbitration Act of 1925 preempts state laws that prohibit contracts from disallowing class-wide arbitration, such as the law previously upheld by the California Supreme Court in the case of Discover Bank v. Superior Court.[3] As a result, businesses that include arbitration agreements with class action waivers can require consumers to bring claims only in individual arbitrations, rather than in court as part of a class action.[4]:708–09 The decision was described by Jean Sternlight as a &quot;tsunami that is wiping out existing and potential consumer and employment class actions&quot;[4]:704 and by law professor Myriam Gilles as &quot;the real game-changer for class action litigation&quot;.[5] By April 2012, Concepcion was cited in at least 76 decisions sending putative class actions to individual arbitration.[6][7] After the decision, several major businesses introduced or changed arbitration terms in their consumer contracts (some of which were based on the consumer-friendly terms found in the AT&T Mobility agreement), although the hypothesis of massive adoption of consumer arbitration clauses following the decision has been disputed.<p>-- Wikipedia<p>TLDR: Class-action lawsuits against Comcast are not allowed because they include a class-action waiver in the consumer agreement.",1443851339

I also like that you have consistent content on your blog which should be helping you with SEO.<p>Now for the fun stuff!!!<p>I have this process I follow called the ABLE process. It stands for Access, Build, Launch and Evaluate.<p>Assuming before you built and launched your product you accessed your market by doing research and conducted user feedback. If not this is a great place to start. If you want to gain users, you have to know who your users are. In advertisement data is key, You say you used Facebook but what if your users are the people on twitter? You have venues, What is the most popular event/s at these venues? Advertising can get expensive, advertising on the wrong channels can kill your startup.<p>Once you know who your users are you can use that data to market on platforms they use organically. Some times organic users come from partners or places. When I think Venue, I think weddings just like you tried on Facebook. Have you tried partnering with wedding retail stores, wedding planners, cake decorates etc? These are all people who connect with your potential users that could promote your business. That is of coarse if your users are people getting married. Your venues might book more birthdays than weddings. Thats why the research is important.<p>Hope this helps!",1443849985

When you treat people like idiots, they will respond like idiots and learn to hate you because of it.<p>The &quot;VCR blinking 12:00&quot; problem is a good one, because it is <i>absolutely not</i> caused from a lack of capability. The clock on the VCR is often a very low priority for most people, and while those of us that understand technology think it&#x27;s a simple thing to set it and move on to other problems, for a lot of people, they estimate that it would require finding the manual, reading it for a while, some trial and error, etc, and they judge <i>it&#x27;s not worth their time</i>. They have more important things to do. The much easier solution is to either ignore it because they really don&#x27;t care, or wait until the local nerd stops by and bug them to do it. I would even suggest it&#x27;s a very good evaluation of opportunity cost.<p>Now, computer security is very important, but it suffers from a pandemic problem: most people are ignorant (which is not their fault) of just how common security problems are, the cost of failure, and the novel problems that technology has created (e.g. automated attacks that make questions like &quot;am <i>I</i> a target?&quot; irrelevant.<p>You will never solve those problems by taking people&#x27;s capabilities away. All you&#x27;ve done is give them a false sense of security, because they trust devices based on an incorrect threat model. Educate them, and they will adjust their behavior. This is <i>significantly less technical</i> than learning how to set a VCR&#x27;s clock.<p>As for UI - consider the example I used in another comment: include a <i>hardware</i> switch that must be flipped to allow &quot;sudo&quot;-style access for things like installing software. People understand this (I knew a LOT of non-technical people that regularly used the write-protect switch on 3.5&quot; floppies when they didn&#x27;t want to erase their homework. Simple metaphors like this, when applied consistently (they shouldn&#x27;t have to use the switch very often) can help a lot.<p>You will never solve everything; if you had a truly foolproof way make a safe OS for <i>everybody</i>, I suspect you would have solved the Halting Problem. So use technology to catch the obvious stuff and provide tools for people, educate them well (this will take a few <i>generations</i>), and <i>most</i> people will be safe enough.<p>What you absolutely shouldn&#x27;t do is limit everybody in a futile effort to try to make it safe for everybody. This is an impossible task, so you will inevitably end up in a cycle where you remove more and more features, as clever people find ways to abuse them.",1443849204

But I am surprised that not spinning up the rear tires triggered that behavior.<p>The loss in power measured here will be very noticeable to diesel owners.  Diesels have narrow power bands.  You don&#x27;t spend much driving time anywhere near the top hp zone.  The torque curves are what matters.  A 10% loss means you will probably have to rev up another 10%, say 3300 rather than 3000, to get at the same power.  While a professional reviewer stepping into a car for the first time might not notice, the guy taking his personal vehicle in sure will.  VW owners will not be happy if the coming fix reduces torque by this much.<p>I suspect this &quot;cheat&quot; is done by enriching the mixture a little to lower the temp and reduce NOx.  Conversely, VW might have been running things too lean under normal operation.  A lean (oxygen-rich) mixture burns hotter, resulting in more power and efficiency but much of that unburnt O2 ends up combining with N2 to form the nasty N0x junk.

10322679,comment,10317790,10320693,0,0,malkia,,,"Rough context: When the GPU (or the CPU back in the days) had to draw a texture, it had to sample pixels, maybe one, maybe four and do some say bi-linear filtering in between them, and then use that pixel as a result.<p>Now several problems:<p>1. If your texture is sampled roughly one pixel from it to one pixel on the screen, and if all pixels are read linearly (&quot;horizontally&quot;), then you are good with the cache, cause for the first pixel you&#x27;ve read the cache maybe cold at that address, but it&#x27;ll load the next pixels just in case you need them, and here is the catch - you need to get always benefit from that - it&#x27;s like always using your coupons, and deals, and your employer perks. So the CPU/GPU might read 4, 8, 16 who really knows (but you) bytes in advance, or around that pixel.<p>2. But then you turn the texture 90 degrees, and suddenly it&#x27;s much slower. You draw a pixel from the texture, but then the next pixel is 256, 512, or more away (&quot;vertically), and then next too, your cache line of 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64 read bytes that you did not used, and by the time you might need them again, the cache discarded them. Hence the slowness now - much much slower!<p>4. To fix it, you come up with &quot;swizzling&quot; - e.g. instead of the texture being purely scan-line by scan-line, you kind of split your image in blocks - maybe 8x8 tiles, or 32x32, and then make sure those tiles are linearly written one to each other. You can go even further, but the idea is that under any angle, if you decide to read, you most likely would hit pixels from the same cache line you&#x27;ve read before. It&#x27;s not that simple, and my explantation is poor, but here is someone who can do that better than me: <a href=""https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/texture-tiling-and-swizzling/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/texture-tiling-and-...</a><p>8. But even with swizzling, tiling, whatever you call that magic to keep pixels together in any direction really together stops working as soon as you have to draw that big texture/image on a much smaller scale.<p>16. Say 256x256 would have to be drawn as 16x16 - And you say I don&#x27;t need mipmapping, I don&#x27;t need smaller versions of my image, I can just use my own image - well then nomatter how you swizzle/tile, you&#x27;ll be skipping a lot of pixels - hop from here to there, and lost cache lines.<p>32. For that reasons mipmaps are here to help, but stay with me for one more minute - and see how they almost fix the shimmering problem of textures with &quot;fences&quot;, &quot;grills on a car&quot;, a pet&#x27;s cage, or something like it.<p>64. And when you hear the artist ready to put real spider-man logo on the character made out of real polygons, and real grill in front of the car, made out of real polygons, and real barbed-wired made out of polygons very nice looking fence - then stay away, as these polys woulds shimmer, no good level of detail can be done for them (it&#x27;ll pop) and such things are just much easily done with textures and mipmaps - it kind of solves a lot of problems.<p>128.

I also remember a study that gave LSD to 10 people during a religious sermon. 9 of them went on the be preachers or priests later in life. That doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it&#x27;s bad. But anything with that powerful an effect on the mind is concerning.<p>Amphetamines certainly seem pretty cool. Especially if you have ADHD. But it definitely has side effects and potential for addiction. It&#x27;s long term effects are not well studied, and a few studies I did see were concerning. E.g. brain damage in monkeys, and a group of kids taking it did worse than the control group after 3 years.<p>I think people should be educated on the risks and facts before they decide to take a drug. If they still want to do it, fine. But at least they know the risks. And it&#x27;s not enough just to put a warning sticker on the back of it that no one reads. Even widespread education that a drug is dangerous isn&#x27;t enough. Everyone knows  cigarettes cause cancer, but why do new people take up smoking?",1443848407

Bit background about me. I am a compiler developer who has over the years picked up HTML/JS & CSS by reading/doing various tutorials. Now, I am good with HTML & JS but I am not able to make good looking websites. I know the very basics of CSS, have done various online tutorials, bought a bunch of books etc. Because of all this, I consider myself  to be &quot;intermediate&quot; level CSS person (not advanced, not beginner). Now, 90% of courses on udemy, coursera start with teaching how to use HTML &(gasp) editor. Then they teach CSS tags, selectors etc. I am past the basics but cannot make  Airbnb or Hipmunk quality. The projects they make you is basic portfolio. There are no courses (or they are very hard to google for)...<p>I am ready to pay 200-300$ for someone who will teach to make me quality, complex UIs(like Hipmunk).<p>So courses I am looking for
1) CSS for backend engineers
2) Advanced bootstrap (or other frontend foundations)
3
At this point, I am able to think of any course I would be interested in.
Feel free to email me. Address in my profile.",1443848404

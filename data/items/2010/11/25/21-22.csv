There has been a tendency over the last bunch of years of increasing government secrecy.<p>Here in Canada we've had a de-facto Information Minister for quite some time.

Whereas it was expected that Ministers, MPs and other government officials would stop by and chat with reporters after the daily parliamentary session, this is not allowed anymore. Everything is a scripted, fake photo-op and journalists frequently are only allowed to ask pre-approved questions. So what's the end result? We can't trust anything these people say, we can't get answers, we just get infantile bullshit thrown at us.

Treating the chemicals should be considered mostly treating symptoms.  Unfortunately, many children today are over medicated because doctors think that if they've removed the symptom (i.e. ADD) they've fixed the problem.<p>Second, we should look at what the soul needs.  For example, if the soul is a separate, higher substance it will not be satiated by a lower substance.  As Jesus says, ""man does not live by bread alone.""  The only thing at the level of a soul is another soul.  So, souls need relationships with other souls.  Theology also comes into the picture here, since theology claims the only thing higher than a human soul is God.  So, ultimate satiation for our soul is found in God.  The medieval church has extensive experience and spiritual disciplines aimed at connecting our souls to God.  Thus, theology becomes an important aspect of psychology.",1290719022

However, I think part of what the post is reacting to is the marketing around the ideas for new clients, or the perceived need for new clients.<p>I haven't been following this so closely, but the articles I have read seem to position these proposals as changes to e-mail as a system, if not as a protocol. I leave thinking the authors want to do something radical, to alter something longstanding, to go up against giant, ingrained players and conventions.<p>I don't think this post would have happened if we were instead hearing more about ""new ways to use e-mail,"" or ""adding functionality to an email client."" I think the narrative is more like, as others in the thread have referenced, PG's frighteningly ambitious ideas, more like visionaries who are daring to challenge something so established.<p>Making a new email client that has some extra features is one thing. Changing email forever is another. I think that's what the post is reacting to.<p>Edit: and, anyway, I think sharpening the discussion by invoking the difference between the client and the protocol is useful, and hopefully will make future conversations about this more clear.",1334505287

A demo is never going to contain a model of a piece of paper on which its own source code (plus additional information) is written in the demo. So there have to be some limits.

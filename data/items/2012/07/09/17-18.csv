As far as I can tell, 3taps is taking data out of the Google Cache and re-aggregating it. While stealing someone's aggregation of data is clearly wrong, re-aggregating data from public sources clearly isn't, both from a legal and moral sense, at least in the US.<p>The material facts in each ad are public data. The fact that such an ad appeared on Craigslist with such facts is also public data.<p><i>> And I join Phil...in suggesting that arguments that the ends justify the means are suspect.</i><p>I'm also suspicious of ends justifying the means, but that isn't the whole story here.<p><i>> Id prefer to see the padmapper folks put up a pirate flag and openly declare war on Craigslist. Just come right out and call them the evil empire already.</i><p>To me, Craigslist is the one being selfish and shortsighted here. If they back legislation seeking ownership rights over re-aggregation of data, that would be an ""evil empire"" move. It would be better for everyone if they subvert Padmapper instead of fighting it.",1341856677

I know that in the end I stopped doing the pgm-class work after about week 7 precisely because there were due dates and I had conflicting priorities. As a point of comparison I started the ML-class long after it had expired worked my way through 50% of the material, did all the assignments and learned enough to solve the problems I needed.  Did some cool projects for a few months and realized that I needed the other 50% to solve some new problem that I had, went back and did that.<p>One the reason we have the idea of a novel, text book, etc is because of restriction on printing. The reason we have the idea of an 'album' in music is again because of limitation on that media (it's not cost effective to produce a bunch of singles and you can't fit much more than an hour of music on a single album due to constraints of traditional media).  Likewise the idea of a semester/quarter long course are essentially based on the limitations of various resources.<p>Ideally we'll see the length and structure of courses change with time. Why have the idea of a course at all? Why not just a directed graph of prerequisite lectures? (Khan does a decent job of this)<p>We're starting to see it form organically, but I think the best situation would be goal directed learning where you pick out a point on the graph and say ""I want to be here, doing this"" and then you fill in all the prereq nodes until you're there.

The PadMapper service consists of <i>advertising that certain content is available on Craigslist.</i> I mean, it literally consists of saying, ""oh, you're looking for a 3-bedroom house under $3,000 in this neighborhood? Here's a page on Craigslist you might want to check out."" That's the extent of the appropriation.<p>I mean, imagine I was reading the Craigslist apartment listings for my own housing search, and I knew you were looking for 3-bedroom Craigslist listings in a given neighborhood, so every time I saw one I sent you the link. Heck, imagine I even charged money for that service. In what universe am I being a dick to Craigslist? How on earth does that follow?<p>I understand that it's a little different here because Craigslist has asked PadMapper not to help people out that way.

Power is a more slippery term that means speed strength, or how much you can lift very, very quickly, and it gives you the explosive paddling speed to catch a big wave or the pedaling burst to fire your mountain bike up a grade. Muscle mass can be a liability in sports like climbing, where its all about strength-to-weight ratio, but mass helps enormously with games like rugby and football, and it can support strength and power  not to mention make you look better in a T-shirt. Muscular endurance means how many times you can lift a given weight in a row without stopping, and its the essence of running, swimming, and even a kayakers long-haul paddling.\nAs for your training sessions themselves, the number one thing to remember is that each of the Fundamental Four responds to a different number of repetitions per set. Lift a weight so heavy you can lift it only once, youre building strength (and, oddly, not much mass); lift a weight you can move six to 12 times, youre building mass (and, oddly, a little less pure strength); ease up to a weight you can lift 50 times, and youre working muscular endurance (which is great for endurance sports but tends to undermine the first three, shrinking your strength, power, and muscle size).""",1341855145

Everyone is creative, it's how they are, not how much they are.<p>2nd Coming up with ideas without a problem is the biggest problem with startups, designers, and creatives everywhere. It's a big reason why they fail and aren't sure why, and it wastes time and energy. The reason you and others can't or have a hard time coming up with ideas is because YOU DONT HAVE A PROBLEM!<p>3rd There is a formula for creativity: C=fa(K<i>I</i>E) Creativity = the function of an Attitude x Knowledge x Imagination x ability to Evaluate.<p>4th The best problems come from experiences, so being curious (to increase your knowledge) and doing things you have never done, not like ping-pong (although I do enjoy it) nor walks on the beach, help you find new problems and actually feel and understand them.<p>5th Once you have these problems, ask why at least 5 times and make sure you have the real problem. The worst scenario is trying to solve the wrong problem, which also leads to lots of failed (and learned from) solutions.<p>6th Once you feel like you really have the right problem, begin solving it (now it's time for IDEAS). Write your problem down, and DIVERGE!!! This means that instead of coming up with an idea, talking about it, deciding on it, then moving onto the next one, you should DIVERGE and come up with as many possible solutions as you can, without thinking about whether they are good or bad. If you are by yourself, its called ideating, if you're with others it's brainstorming. Either way DEFER JUDGEMENT. Turn your filter off until later, on your own ideas, and others'. Write everything down. You can judge them all later (converging).<p>7th It helps to practice diverging and creativity, it's like working out. The parts in your brain that help you come up with solve problems/come up with ideas get better at it te more you do it. You can practice on problems like: what might be all the uses for a brick, or all the ways you might change a bathtub, or all of the uses for 10,000 left handed gloves.<p>8th Know that per problem, if you truly want to solve it, you will spend at least an hour just diverging. Understand that it (on average) takes over 30 minutes to get past those ""low-hanging fruit"" ideas and get to the good ones, thats the time where you're like ""I can't come up with any more"". If you keep pushing through you will!<p>A few tools/rules for diverging:\n1. Defer Judgement (on your ideas, and others)\n2. Build on Ideas (and let others build on you)\n3. Wild and Crazy is OK (my favorite, GO CRAZY on solutions. It's always easier to take a crazy idea and make it more realistic, than it is a simple idea and make it crazier/better)\n4. Quantity = Quality (the more ideas you have, the better ideas you will have after converging, ie 10 ideas you might have one good one, 100 ideas you will definitely have at least 10 good ones)<p>I'm new at this, and the people I have learned from and those they learned from do much crazier things than I do, and here's an example of something I have run and how these tools can help:\nI've worked with people that had 7 ideas in an hour, and the next hour I helped them (just facilitated, no ideas from me) get them to 400 in the same time frame. Same people, same problem, just new insight on different ways to solve problems and brainstorm together.<p>These ideas have been studied and research for 60 years, have continued to get better, and are practiced all over the world.

I assume your case is less complicated.<p>What you need to do is make a simple spreadsheet in Excel, lay down some assumtions and tie them to your revenue with formulas. After you have it done, you can either (1) optimize to find sweet spot, or (2) make several scenarios.<p>This would help you play safe - all assumptions are transparent. Also, since you seem to have investors, they would have a choice and most probably they would push for a more agressive scenario.

Well I searched for www.mostpopularpicture.com and it was available. I instantly knew I can spend a weekend and hack a quick little site. So, I did it.

Currently I don't have tagging, voting, likes or comments feature even though I have designed db to have it.<p>My question to the readers, is it a good idea to spend some time to work on a small project to replace salary or raise fund than work on the start up idea which may take a year before you see some kind of cash flow? Or, it's a waste of time and one would stick to the original idea and work towards it?<p>Some may say, pitch your ideas to VC. Well! First of all pitching idea does not guaranty money, second being from Houston TX, we don't have access to VCs like guys in Valley does, plus at this point I don't want VC to get involved. I would like to get some traction then raise money to expand. Also, the time I spend on this weekend project is way less than I would have to come up with a presentation, travel and convincing VCs. Neither do I want to work on my start up idea on weekends or by burning mid-night oil to avoid getting burned out.<p>I don't know if I will get success with this weekend project to raise some fund but it would be interesting to know how it will turn out.<p>ps.

4219110,comment,4212502,4213300,1,0,geebee,,,"This is a slightly complicated topic.  It comes down to a substantial difference between elite state institutions and elite privates, undergraduate and graduate programs, and engineering/cs vs general majors.<p>Elite private universities (stanford, harvard) tend to have very small undergraduate populations and draw from a national or international pool of applicants.  This of course makes them highly selective, as spots are scarce and the applicant pool is large.  Public universities (Berkeley, UW) have very large undergraduate student bodies (often 5 times the size of a small private) and require a much larger portion of in-state students.  More slots, smaller applicant pool means a much higher admission rate and generally lower numbers (SATs and so forth).  Like another poster mentioned, 25%ile at MIT > 75% at UW, but the top 25% of the class at UW is larger than the entire undergrad population at MIT. The difference in nature of undergraduate admissions makes the averaging kind of meaningless.<p>At the graduate level, elite private and public universities tend to admit roughly similar numbers of students.  And not surprisingly, admission rates are much more comparable.  Elite publics, for some reason, seem to do particularly well at the grad level in engineering and computer science (aside from Cornell, the ivies don't really show up much on the top 10 lists, while Berkeley, Illinois, Michigan, Texas, and so forth are highly ranked - by the same magazine (US News) that doesn't put a single public into the top 20 at the undergrad level).<p>Lastly, there is the question of the degree itself.  At top publics, engineering often requires a second admissions process - you get into Berkeley or UW, and then you have to keep your grades high enough to gain admission to the engineering or CS major.  You can gain admission directly to the major from high school, but that's tougher.  And the process of getting the degree itself is daunting - I don't know much about UW, but the coursework in CS at Berkeley is extremely rigorous (and I have no reason to think it wouldn't be at UW as well).  As with UW, Berkeley does have a much larger undergraduate population.  It's less selective because of that (and the in-state quota), but on the way out, we're talking about students in the top quarter of the class, from a major that is extremely difficult to enter and complete.<p>All in all, I'm not surprised that people would feel that the undergrads who make it out of CS from UW are among the top grads that year.  The grad level programs are already known to be top 10, so I don't think that even comes up.",1341853717

I'm finding that I don't use it as much as I thought I would, though.<p>The missing feature for me is the ability to share a column between boards. This would let me work with other people. Work is hierarchical. I make big decisions and then those big decisions get split up and consumed by other folks. I can't have everybody controlling boards at every level. So when I drop ""clean room"" to my ""Stuff my son is handling"" column, I don't care or know how he breaks that up and does it. All I care about is that once he's broken up that work and completed all of it that he passes the card to my ""done"" column. I create and track the task at a high level. He does the same at a lower level. My big task breaks up into a bunch of small tasks for him. The same kind of scenario plays out in lots of things: refurbishing a house, planning for a summer vacation, tending to landscaping around the house, and so on.<p>Everything can't be flat. There has to be some kind of hierarchical structure. Having one column appear in multiple boards would allow that to happen. Might be some other solutions. Don't know.

The colon works as a nice visual delimiter.<p>I like a lot about Rust, but one thing I vehemently dislike is how type names are all lowercase by convention. It's unambiguous in variable declarations, but everywhere else it reduces visual information. In most other languages, I immediately know that ""Foo"" is a type and that ""foo"" is a variable. Even though Rust allows for omitting the type in many places, it quickly becomes a sea of lowercase for me.<p>This, plus the focus on short keywords/identifiers and C++-style syntax (::, semicolons), makes Rust look a lot gnarlier than Go, overall.<p>It also seems to me that Rust still hasn't fully adopted its ""object syntax""? One aspect of Go I really like is how functions can be used as methods and you design entire interfaces associated with a type -- the best of object-orientation without the worst.

They don't have to hack up the compiler or anything.<p>The other problem is cultural. Lispers resent implementation-level <i>obligation</i> to a set of rules that were made ignorant of any given problem they may be solving. What if you need to resolve something at runtime? What if you need to resolve something at compile-time? Lisp lets you choose where each should happen.<p>I feel similarly about purity. I think it makes for a nice default, but I think the degree to which immutability is forced on you in Clojure and Haskell are pretty damned awkward for expressing a variety of problems and not just ones related to IO. It seems especially silly since a lot of code in Common Lisp will by default be pure because it'll just return results based on inputs absent mutation.<p>Regarding your delvings into Lisp, since you're not unfamiliar with the benefits of functional programming I'd like to recommend a book that will help you break ground with a dynamically typed, multiple-dispatch Lisp with an object system.

I'd just like to be able to pay $40 for it full stop.  I'm not 'upgrading' from anything, and this will mean I've got to shell out $200+ for it if I want to use it legally.<p>I do have an old vista ultimate license, but I don't have it installed and probably won't install it again because I moved VM too many times and the process for reactivation was annoying.  Maybe I'll have to suck it up again?<p>Given that most people just get Windows installed on a machine, and the mfg aren't paying more than $50 per license, why can't we have lower retail prices?  $50 for a copy of Windows - I'd have no incentive to pirate.  $200+... ??<p>Will I be able to upgrade to Win8 with a Vista license key?

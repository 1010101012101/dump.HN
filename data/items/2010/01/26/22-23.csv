1079155,comment,1078529,1078777,0,0,dkarl,,,"Your observation about geeks fearing phone conversations is spot on, but I think it has to do with more than just turn-taking.  I think it's a general social anxiety that manifests more strongly with phone calls because they're easier to avoid or procrastinate and because they often intrude social anxiety into a very safe, non-challenging social environment.  I would guess that face-to-face conversations that are easy to avoid or postpone are just as anxiety-provoking as phone calls.<p>Anyhow, I am certainly a phone-phobic geek.  When I was a young child, I was terrified of talking on the phone.  I was too geeky to understand the social aspects of a phone call, but I was smart enough to know I didn't understand most of what happened during a phone conversation.  When my parents called somebody to ask a question or invite them somewhere, it would take fifteen minutes.  Typically, I had one goal in mind, such as asking my friend Jon if he wanted to play.  That was all I understood, but I also understood a phone conversation was supposed to be more complicated than that, and that I had to be polite to whoever answered the phone.  I had terrible performance anxiety.<p>Strangely, I still have an aversion to making phone calls to people I don't know well.  Even simple, low-risk, impersonal tasks like calling to ask a restaurant's hours or calling the dentist to make an appointment produce a significant amount of anxiety.  The more often I talk to someone on the phone, the more the anxiety decreases, though.  Talking on the phone to my family and close friends generates no anxiety.",1264546509

1079113,comment,1077772,1078944,0,0,siculars,,,"That speaks to the intolerable nature of working in one of these bureaucracies. I could not agree with you more. There is a lack of talent in this field and a lot of it has to do with the leadership. Decision makers not only do not understand the potential of suggested solutions but also are unwilling to take the risk on homegrown or non-vendor supported solutions. In doing so they alienate the talent that works for them and forces them to look elsewhere.<p>I'll outline a <i>hypothetical</i> problem... Large institution passes on homegrown solution (no vendor support problem) buys large commercial system. Large commercial system takes years to integrate into med center culture and legacy systems, problems abound. Innovative students/professors/physicians/staff suggest enhancements to better... everything and do things the system does not and was not intended to do. None of this gets done due to short sighted, risk averse administration and lack of integration support from vendor. Nobody at med center knows how to decipher the gargantuan database schema or access their own data (programmatically) outside of the commercial gui. Frustrated talent walks out the door. Rinse, repeat.<p>Now, if these systems came with documented bidirectional open api's then people could just do whatever they wanted (with appropriate access controls, duh). If someone wants to write a new and better client for Twitter they do not have to ask twitter for permission, they just do it. Although vendors do use HL7 for ADT related activities, there is way more to a modern day EHR than that. And before people start beating me up about protected HIPAA data, simply control access tokens to pump fake data during development.<p>Speaking to your other point about HL7, it's inherent standards, CCD/CDA and HITSP, I agree, there are certain proposed solutions but how are they actually employed? Whatever incentives ARRA is offering they just are not enough or geared in a fashion that may make a dent, imho.<p>I don't know if you can tell, but I am highly disillusioned as to the state of the state in this industry. Best as I can tell leadership in this area will come from out of the way, non academic, regional for profit hospital conglomerates that will force change to drive profit. Once the rest of the field sees their results they may join in in any standards those leaders employ. Hopefully they will include the bidirectional open api concept. I'm not holding my breath.<p>EDIT: When I say ""if these systems came with documented bidirectional open api's"" I am speaking to your point re ""they are rarely implemented properly"". These existing api's <i>may</i> get the job done, but they are rarely implemented and if they are, they are certainly not implemented properly. Perhaps that should be incentivized as well?",1264545507

Or it's not secure at all, it was hit by nomads and fail.<p>The western world did wrong on many levels during this Google flamewar<p>1. Never accuse C.C.P. gov't directly & plainly, they already have dozens of counter plans ready, and they are experienced dealing with it. You have to use tactics to play with CCP gov't<p>2. Democracy, freedom means nothing in Chinese culture, esp. in average people's subconscious mind. Sometimes it even means some fuckedup ideology sponsored by the US Imperialism.<p>3. Keep the flamewar off politics and there are more chances of winning. We (Chinese) knew Google and the others will lose the battle as soon as the state.gov announcements came out. The CCP gov't has an ultimate weapon, patriotism. Any dispute can magically transformed to national security and ethnic pride by the hands of the official propaganda dept. No matter how reasonable you are, you will be overtaken by the patriotic voices inside this country overnight.<p>4. Use C.C.P.'s own claim to slam itself. For example, the CCP proudly declares it as a 'public servant', then why should a servant censor the master's mind? During days of the initial introductions of the Internet, many early official textbook in China declares the Internet as something without borders, with no political regulations, everyone can join and speak, but now it says it must be ruled under the Party's law and to keep the state stable.<p>5. The word 'censorship' sounds trivial to Chinese people, you have to use more severe and native expressions to interpret the concept. For example 'Literary Inquisition' <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_Inquisition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_Inquisition</a>, or Naming Taboo. Because the CCP propaganda actively condemn these actions, it's irony and hilarious to see itself doing the exact shit right now. Another classy example is you can't copy paste China's Constitution Law on most of Chinese forums, weblogs or message boards because the system will prompt you there's 'illegal' keyword in the content.<p>6. The CCP gov't always accuse the US for it's cold war mentality, esp. in the pre-WTO days, but the Party now acts exactly like its role in a Cold War. There's even a growing anti-globalization hype inside China that the state should abolish foreign stuff and make Chinese alternative completely on <i>everything</i>",1264545298

Someone (poor fool!) actually admitted to using, and  liking, Dreamweaver for certain code and HTML editing.<p>Boom! The jackals were on him in an instant, tearing away at any and all weak spots.  It was pretty funny.<p>So, yeah, I've been guilty of this myself, but lately I've been trying to pay more attention to what people are saying and why.  The Dreamweaver dude had plausible reason for his preference.  But every time he mentioned something he liked about it, two or three people jumped in to explain how  he could do that with TextMate or Vim or whatever.<p>While I think people were mostly trying to be helpful, a good part of this had to be the opportunity to show off specialized knowledge of this or that tool.<p>It's why trolling is one of the best ways to get help.<p>Don't ever ask how to do something; assert that something <i>can't be done.</i><p>You'll get a flood of people wanting to show off and prove you wrong.<p>(Someone one has written about this behavior, and has an Internet law or rule  named after him regarding this, but I can't recall who.

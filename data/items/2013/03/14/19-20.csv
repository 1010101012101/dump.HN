No more hunting around for plugins and themes post-installation - they are right there ready to activate. Check it out and let me know your thoughts.<p>Roadmap for future features:\n- allow language choice for WP main zip\n- allow users to upload their own commercial plugins and themes to add to their installers\n- allow users to choose any plugin from the WP SVN repository\n- allow the site to push into GIT<p>Any others I should consider?",1363291196

Can you help me understand what would happen under this protocol were an investor to pull out because of something that is discovered in due diligence? Or if the proposed modification were not to be acceptable to the company seeking investment? I would imagine in that case that any dispute would be over whether the discrepancy was material enough to justify the modification or withdrawal.<p>Either way, though, there is a clear difference between this and a verbal agreement in that if the parties cannot reach a reasonable compromise, a dispute around a verbal agreement will most likely (although not always) be dropped, and an email exchange such as this would provide a greater opportunity to litigate.<p>From my point of view, one primary rational of having a written contract is to reduce the likelihood of litigation.

The startup costs may be different, but the overhead is more than likely the same as a b&m.  Apples to apples that is.<p>At most chef driven trucks, you will get food prepared by the chef himself/herself.  Some customers perceive a value in this, hence the willingness to pay the higher prices of some trucks.<p>However, I do agree that the truck and its food will have to eventually provide a value that will keep a customer coming back.  $9 sliders are insane.  I've seen this play out time and time again at other trucks because the 'fad' and popularity gets to their heads. Some operators of trucks that have become popular really quickly become shortsighted and cater only to the yelpers who are excited about the latest new thing.

5377244,comment,5368415,5376746,2,0,tptacek,,,"Wow. Ok. Let me take a shot at this.<p>* Bills start as draft language. The draft is circulated so that organizations like ACLU can point out things like ""this bill gives too much deference to content rightsholders"". The bill's authors then say, ""that's not at all the intent of the bill"" <i>and then fix the language</i>. It is very weird to complain about this, since it's the system actually working in the public interest. So, sorry, you're going to have to keep reading the bill. Also: CISPA is tiny. You can read it inside of 5 minutes. It isn't PPACA, the bill Pelosi commented on.<p>* I don't think software vulnerabilities are the best or most likely example of information that will be shared from the USG to the private sector under CISPA, but to the extent it is, you can simply assume that a (say) OpenSSH bug disclosed under CISPA to (say) Facebook is going to be patched immediately. I am a vulnerability researcher; that's my profession. It is a near-consensus among vulnerability researchers that the sooner vulnerability data is published, the safer we all are. I find it difficult to be concerned that CISPA might get OpenSSL flaws published faster. If that happens, great.<p>* If organizations don't want to share vulnerability information with the USG, they don't have to. CISPA is entirely opt-in. Moreover: vulnerabilities are a bad example of information CISPA enables sharing for. Companies can already lawfully share vulnerabilities with the USG. There is a whole cottage industry of small companies that sell vulnerabilities to the intelligence services. To the extent that your concerns about CISPA involve trafficking in privacy-harming exploit code (a very legitimate concern in general), you are (respectfully) ill informed about the current state of cybersecurity regulation.<p>* The reason CISPA preempts existing privacy laws and provides protection from liability is because there are lots of different privacy regulations on the books that make it difficult for companies operating in certain verticals to share <i>any</i> data without expensive legal review. If you deal with classroom data, you've got FERPA. If you have driver records, you have DPPA. CISPA does not repeal DPPA or HIPAA or FERPA; instead, it simply says that as long as companies are dealing in good faith with attack data --- ""cyber threat information"", a term the bill goes to some lengths to define --- they can reasonably assume they won't get sued for violating HIPAA by sharing that attack data.<p>* Individuals are exempted as private entities to protect individual privacy. The intent of that definition as stated by the bill's authors was to prevent CISPA from being interpreted as a mechanism for ISPs and the USG to enter into agreements to track individual customers. See ""Myths and Facts About CISPA"" at the House Intelligence Committee page. So: you have that concern exactly backwards.<p>* I don't have any response to your concern that the USG should not be liable for negligence in publishing sensitive data. I see it as a good thing that the bill creates accountability for the handling of the data, and wish there was more accountability in the bill, not less.<p>There are other questions in your comment that I didn't address because I didn't understand them, sorry.",1363290405

Some of the numbers quoted don't really make sense to me, but maybe it's a location thing (I'm in LA, where the food truck industry is plateauing out). 200 orders for lunch is very, very rare here.<p>Our local food truck association actively addresses regulations that are unfair to foodtrucks on a city by city basis.  Most have to do with the local business community trying to prevent foodtrucks from competing with b&m restaurants, usually by getting law enforcement to harass trucks with citations, tickets, whatever they can throw at you.<p>Do I see the foodtrucks eventually disrupting b&m's? Not likely, but I do see an impact.  B&M's have had to be more nimble and creative to keep up, which ends up being a good thing for customers.  I have been presented with business models that involve franchising our truck and concept across the country to different groups (ex-military most recently, from what I hear about the Grilled Cheese Truck) as a way to help develop small businesses.  This is where I mostly see the similarity to startups.  Foodtrucks are more accessible, financially and creatively.  One can literally go from concept to launch in less than a month.  Try that with a b&m restaurant.  The thing is, I also see a high failure rate. (foodtrucks have been dropping like flies here in L.A., mostly during winter).  Other similarities or takeaways, which also apply to most other business:<p>1. Know your market well. Cities have different regulations, population densities, competing restaurants, etc.  If you don't have a very very very good awareness of where the bulk of your business will come from, you're doomed.  I've seen trucks sprout and die within a month, clueless operators and the inability to pivot.<p>2. Know your product well and how to sell it.  I've seen employees stutter through a dish description, with the potential sale walking away to the truck whose operator can spitfire all the ingredients of each of his dishes without looking up from the slider he's working on.<p>3. Streamline your operation to deliver your most important product as fast possible and as perfect as possible.  Lunch crowds can be harsh. These are people who have limited time and limited budget and (depending on location) almost unlimited choices.  If you're the truck who took 20 minutes to serve a rice bowl, you can trust that person is never going back and would most likely drag all their friends to another truck the next day.<p>Simple 'rules' but you'd be surprised how many operators can't figure this out.",1363289887

Each node tracks every customer's balance and broadcasts transactions.  That's how the turnstile is always able to respond instantly, because the validation is local.  It's possible to duplicate a card and swipe it simultaneously at different stations to double-spend.  It's considered an acceptable leak in the system given the high effort, infungibility of the good, and near-zero actual cost of a free-rider.<p>Where subways diverge from Bitcoin is that sold goods can represent a real loss, can be resold thus creating the incentive to scam, and that Bitcoin is anonymous where subway cards aren't (security cameras) so repeated instances of this crime can be caught.

This 100 line function is made of forms made of forms made of forms and each can be replaced by the code that you might need. It's the beauty of the conciseness of the ternary operator in other language (a = b? 1 : 2) taken to a possibly infinite extreme.<p>This can sometimes be achieved in other languages with the use of temporary variables, one-shot functions if the language doesn't have lambdas (or multi-line lambdas like Python) and in the end litter your soul with the use of ""eval""<p>This also leads to the other wow moment, when using Lisp makes it appear other languages' syntax so inelegant and cumbersome. At its core everything in Lisp is just like this:<p>(FUNCTION argument1 argument2 )<p>When it clicks, it really hits you with the beauty of its perfect mathematical purity and you wonder how can you feel so comfortable with the average C-like language, where <i>for</i> has a syntax that is different from <i>while</i>, <i>switch case</i> is a beast of its own, sometimes you use curly brackets, sometimes square, sometimes regular or even angular, you don't have to forget commas and semicolons, you use colons and dots and question marks and myriads of keywords each with its own syntax and some things are functions and other operators and equal means something different from the double equals and so on.",1363289382

I believe in the social arena, no one has found a viable solution yet.<p>The real crux of this (at least one crux, if you see this more as a gimic dating then you may view it another way) is creating a verified online image / reputation.  This site simply applies that to dating, with the idea here being you are not creating the profile so it is by definition verified by other people who created it.<p>I had friends who attempted a social network startup based on this idea.  The obvious problem you run into is the temptation by friends to write jokes / things that are untrue, which I think actually increases with a site like this.  I absolutely want to see who starts reaching out to my friends after I write describe them as ""Avid Harry Potter fan, captain of the local quiditch team"" and add a status updates like ""He's in a bad mood today, very upset he scratched his wand yesterday"".  Our friends attempted to put some legitimacy behind their site by requiring you to accept statements before they were publicly viewed, but then you lose a lot of the legitimacy / verified nature of the profile.<p>Eventually they pivoted to the professional arena, with recommendations by professionals, professors, etc.  People who by the nature of your relationship are more likely to respond accurately.  There are issues with this model as well, such as co-workers who you pissed off writing bad things, selection bias if you get to pick who reviews you (anonymous helps that) etc, but I think there are significantly inherent advantages in the professional arena.  But even in that area, I don't think the main ""issue"" has been resolved.<p>This is definitely a concept with real business potential should it be mastered; it solves a ""real-problem"" which many startups do not (with the specific application here being online dating, but there are 20 other great applications which could become viable businesses).  I certainly do not mean to discourage the work done (I think the site actually looks good in form and function), but it is my opinion a tweaks on this current model will not emerge as solutions to the broader reputational verification issue online.  I believe an outside the box and completely different solution will emerge in this area.<p>What do people think?  Is anyone familiar with a version of this model that really does work?

Which was why I brought that up.<p>Your second graf begs my question. Obviously we're both aware of the ECPA and SCA. My question was, in what way do the preemptions on those acts materially harm the public interest? Put it this way: if you think that CISPA is in direct conflict with SCA, then clearly you can imagine situations in which e.g. Facebook could collect Netflow data from a DDOS attack and then worry that they'd somehow contravene SCA by sharing the information. Doesn't that ""conflict"" explain the need for an act like CISPA?<p>I'd also note that the first three acts you cited --- obviously the three most important, because they cover the integrity of online communications in general and not with respect to any particular application domain --- already contain exemptions similar in spirit to the ones in CISPA:<p>* ECPA permits providers to collect and in some limited cases share information that is related to the maintenance of their own infastructure<p>* SCA permits collection and monitoring of stored communication by the operators of stored communication services<p>* The Wiretap Act allows operators to intercept and monitor signals causing disruption to networks<p>CISPA harmonizes collection and sharing of data in cases of direct adversarial attacks. Compared to the exceptions in (for instance) ECPA, CISPA is narrowly tailored and very specific.<p>Furthermore, when you point out all the laws encumbering sharing of attack information, you start to make the preemption point for me. It may already be possible to share attack information, so long as it doesn't involve raw emails, and the attack information is shared by telecom providers under the ECPA maintenance exemption. UNLESS YOU'RE AN AUTO INSURANCE COMPANY, in which case Congress helpfully (and reasonably!) enacted a specific privacy regime under DPPA, which means now simply to have Progressive push netflow records to Verizon they might have to incur $50,000 in legal review which by the time it's done the attack will be over.<p>Instead of repeating my original question --- how exactly does CISPA conflict with existing privacy laws in ways that harm the public interest? --- why don't I ask the question in a different framing. If we stipulate that the problem we're talking about here does exist --- that Advocate Health Care in Illinois would incur significant and unnecessary legal risk in pushing netflow DDOS information to a public clearinghouse --- what is the privacy-protecting language YOU would like to see in a bill that aimed to address that problem?<p>Incidentally: can you do better than thanking me for a polite response? I'm not actually sure I'm being that polite anyways; I feel like I'm being blunt and direct. But on the other hand, you wrote a comment with a complicated technical question last night at 1:00AM, and when you didn't get a prompt response, you accused me of ""handwaving"". Can I argue now that it it's pretty obvious that neither you nor I is ""handwaving"", and that we've both done our homework, or at least way more homework than most CISPA commenters have done? Instead of thanking me for polite responses, could you instead just not impugn my motives or intellectual honesty again? We can then just chalk our initial static up to ""message boards and politics"".<p><i>PS: The worst, most crazymaking thing about CISPA debates online is that they invariably put me in the position of ""CISPA advocate"". I have a position in the CISPA debate: ""CISPA is not evil"". I think if you believe like I do that CISPA is facially benign, the way organizations like EFF are choosing to message against it starts to get disquieting. But my position does not carry into ""CISPA is a great idea"". A sane argument against CISPA is that it forestalls a needed reform across all online privacy bills to enable network security to function sanely. CISPA might be a bad idea. I am not a CISPA advocate. I just don't think it's overtly contrary to the public interest.</i>",1363288456

I think you're point of frustration is not really about economic freedom, but a recognition of the senescence of our society ( in the US ). As societies get older, literally and population wise, they tend to get more conservative.  E.g. it's much easier to be a medical device entrepreneur in India than the US.<p>There are pros and cons to greater regulation.  Established cities like SF, DC, and NYC, limit the number of taxis because there are literal hard limits on all the gov't provided functions around taxi's, including regulation of 'expectation of legitimacy,' and managing traffic congestion. In the case of hotels and to a lesser extent restaurants, there are zoning, housing, and infrastructure investments that cities have made from a gov't perspective and a private perspective that, AirBnB and FoodTrucks throw out of whack.  Reading this article you see how much regulation FoodTrucks are now starting to come under, to try and bring their 'perceived' quality in line with that of a restaurant.  It's hard to find arguments against this, other than, it is now demonstrably harder to be a new business.  The same is not yet happening with airbnb style 'hotel' rooms because there is more money and the players are bigger.<p>I think the real problem is that the gov't is poorly organized to deal with the wisdom of crowds.  I don't need a hotel regulation agency as much for an airbnb type rental because the economic interests of the 'landlord' are such that my 'review' really counts.  personally, I'd prefer airbnb, food trucks, and uber to their respective old-world counterparts, precisely for the reason that it's much more difficult for regulatory capture given those de-centralized models. But there are legitimate arguments on the other side, around investment, community goals, and 'safety'.  Unit economics in each of these cases make it much harder to systematically screw the customer.  Now if only we could disrupt telecom this way, so I can stop dealing with Comcast.",1363288398

The post essentially claimed that his diet is dangerous until proven otherwise and therefore everyone should follow a ""natural"" diet of whole foods instead. It's a false dichotomy, even if his diet proves to be lacking or unhealthy in some way that does not make a ""natural"" diet automatically healthy.<p>Furthermore he makes the mistake of assuming correlation is causation. I.E. he claims the recent rise of processed foods and the increased incidence of poor health are a cause and effect relationship when in fact no evidence to such a connection exists other than the very weak correlation between them. He then goes on to extrapolate from this false causation that what he perceives as the opposite of processed foods, I.E. whole foods, are therefore inherently healthy.<p>The fact is whole foods are not special in any regard, being unprocessed does not magically confer health benefits on them. There are plenty of unprocessed substances, including various plants that are unhealthy or in many cases poisonous.<p>What the man in the article is attempting is a vital first step in better understanding human nutritional requirements.

I suppose its consistent with US foreign policy.<p>I suppose if the US gov expect to bully nation states around because the US has the most military power and can bomb folk back to the stone age if they don&#x27;t comply, then treating its own citizens like that and expecting them to cower to the gun makes sense.<p>As I say, it consistent at least.

In the nineteenth century,\n  which was a dark and inflationary age in typography and type design,\n  many compositors were encouraged to stuff extra space between sentences.\n  Generations of twentieth century typists were then taught to do the\n  same, by hitting the spacebar twice after every period. Your typing\n  as well asyour typesetting will benefit from unlearning this quaint\n  Victorian habit. As a general rule, no more than a single space is\n  required after a period, colon, or any other mark of punctuation.\n  Larger spaces (e.g., en spaces) are *themselves* punctuation.\n</code></pre>\n Robert Bringhurst, The Elements of Typographic Style, 3rd Edition, 2.1.4<p>(Some people go as far as to recommend <i>less</i> than word space after a period or comma, since the blank area above the punctuation mark contributes to the total visual white space.)",1375411306

The catch though is since everything is WP is triggered by HTTP requests the way wp-cron works is to check if there is a job to run <i>every</i> time a WP page is hit. Yes you understood that correctly, <i>every</i> single page that is rendered also checks if it should fire off a cron job. The jobs get executed async in the background so it doesn&#x27;t hold up the ongoing request but it has two interesting properties.<p>1. If your site gets a large influx in traffic the server runs wp-cron for every page hit and further slows things down.<p>2. If your site gets <i>no</i> traffic then it doesn&#x27;t run at all.<p>Funny eh?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.6/wp-cron.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.6/wp-cron.php</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://wp.tutsplus.com/articles/insights-into-wp-cron-an-introduction-to-scheduling-tasks-in-wordpress/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wp.tutsplus.com/articles/insights-into-wp-cron-an-int...</a>",1375410279

Don&#x27;t nitpick.<p>> Memory is shared system state. To write correct parallel programs, CPUs need to define how they manage consistency between different processors. x86 does have a more conservative model with stronger consistency than ARM, and this does have (theoretical) scaling consequences-- but Intel has a huge amount of experience making it fast.<p>Yeah, but what worries me is not raw throughput scaling; it&#x27;s power consumption. The mainstream netbooks today: Macbook Air Mid-2012, Chromebook Pixel, and Lenovo X1 Carbon all use the 17W i5-3427U. The MBA Mid-2013 jumped to Haswell early and uses the 15W Core i5-4250U. But we still haven&#x27;t been able to make a decent quad-core netbook: there&#x27;s a 15W Core i7-4650U; I believe you can get an MBA 2013 with this as well, but a paltry 1.7 Ghz?<p>How many years has it been since quad-cores first came out? It looks to me like x86 has stagnated: it doesn&#x27;t matter how competent Intel is; the architecture seems to have fundamental problems.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t fully understand what the ARM A57 is, but the specs look really impressive [1].  Moreover, AMD has confirmed that they will manufacture Opterons in Q1 2014 [2]. I&#x27;m not completely sold on ARM or anything, but there is certainly something interesting going on: and we must investigate.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-a50/cortex-a57-processor.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-a50/cortex-a57...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.amd.com/us/press-releases/Pages/amd-unveils-2013june18.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amd.com/us/press-releases/Pages/amd-unveils-2013j...</a>",1375409007

6255244,comment,6254643,6254643,36,0,jason_tko,,,"As a founder of a Japan based startup catering to businesses in Japan (MakeLeaps) and also as a co-organiser of the Hacker News Tokyo Meetups with my co-founder Paul, I found this article to be full of defeatism, inaccurate and generally disappointing.<p>A few points:<p>this is accompanied by a very envious, critical and vocal audience. They underline every possible reason that the product will fail and keep doing so indefatigably. They attack the innovator on Twitter, Facebook, blogs, etc; and they keep doing so until the innovator raises a white flag.<p>What.<p>There&#x27;s always haters and detractors. That&#x27;s part of doing anything in life, and start-ups are no exception.<p>Once, a Japanese guy spent 10 minutes trying to explain that our startup&#x27;s failure was guaranteed because Japanese people would never upload their company stamp (a necessary function of official Japanese business documents) to a web service. Even after I told him we already have a bunch of users who are doing this, he was steadfast, so I simply crossed him off the list of people to spend time on. Problem solved.<p>One of the very first things we learned when selling to businesses in Japan is that social proof is a critical factor. So our focus changed to getting even a single business using our software, and then trying to feature them and promote them as much as we could.<p>It&#x27;s pretty damn hard for people to say your product is failing when you can show you have a lot of people using it.<p>The more we did this, the more businesses we could get, and  we continued to repeat this process until last month when we finally crossed 10,000 signed up companies in Japan.<p>Getting to here took years of work. This is part of a startup. Understanding your problem space and challenges, and then adapting your product and marketing message accordingly.<p>&quot;Japanese businessmen tend not to trust the younger generation.&quot;<p>Oh yeah? Try doing a startup and being in the younger generation, AND being foreigners.<p>You have to build and earn trust over time. You&#x27;re not handed a trust card as soon as you open a new business.<p>&quot;If you look at successful Japanese start-ups, they are mostly run by CEOs who have applied the foreign connection in some way&quot;<p>This is frustratingly inaccurate, and belies a total lack of exposure and understanding of the Japanese startup scene. There are plenty of very successful startups that are based in Japan, and focused on Japan, that have zero foreign elements.<p>&quot;In some cases, like Mr Son, he has managed to combine all five factors.&quot;<p>Commentating on the Japanese startup scene using the CEO of Softbank as an example, Softbank being a company founded in 1981 with a market cap of 43 billion dollars, makes no sense at all.<p>&quot;Theres lots of venture capitalists here but they are only interested in games and new media&quot;<p>Wrong. We get weekly un-solicited contacts from Japanese VCs asking for meetings with us.<p>This is a result of us hustling very hard over a long period of time, and working very hard to establish our credibility and stability.<p>The Japanese startup scene definitely has areas where it can improve, but they&#x27;re at best papered over in this article.",1377147356

6255240,comment,6246411,6246411,1,0,avenger123,,,"First of all, how much time do you have to devote to this? Will you be quitting your full time job? Will you be doing this over all your free time? The amount you want to accelerate is entirely dependent on how much time you have to devote to it. This is also a question of how much patience you have and how you get started. Programming really is all about peeling the onion. It&#x27;s easy to write an Hello World app but there are so many layers below that it can become very overwhelming. I will make the assumption that this is a side thing you want to get going.<p>Programming by itself is not hard. What is hard is the amount of implicit (or explicit) knowledge that exists in the profession that isn&#x27;t directly related to writing a web application or another piece of software. Now, its not hard to pick up this knowledge but its a barrier. To be a good programming you need to understand computer architecture, TCP/IP networking, HTTP protocol, how a piece of text written in a programming language ultimately gets turned into assembly language and then run on the CPU. There is a lot more along those lines. Now, I am not saying you need to understand it at a PhD level any of this but you need a more than basic understanding to be effective.<p>What most of us that have been doing this for a long time don&#x27;t realize is that our passion for technology and computers in general at a young age had given has a head start since we&#x27;ve picked up most of this knowledge (either self-though or going through CS or engineering programs).<p>My recommendation would be to sign up for the online Stanford Introduction to Computer Science courses:<p><a href=""http://see.stanford.edu/see/courses.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://see.stanford.edu/see/courses.aspx</a><p>And start to do the first one on your own.<p>Alongside that you can also start the Coursera courses:\n<a href=""https://www.coursera.org/courses?orderby=upcoming&cats=cs-theory,cs-programming,cs-systems"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/courses?orderby=upcoming&cats=cs-th...</a><p>The Learn to Program and the Algorithm courses are good.<p>If you are keen you should be able to go through these courses fast. The Stanford ones are not easy but will give you a taste of what a real computer science curriculum is all about. The lectures themselves are extremely worthwhile (Mehran Sahami is a great teacher).<p>The point of these are not to make you a Ruby on Rails developer, or Python whiz, etc. It&#x27;s to help you understand the fundamentals.This will also help you determine if it really is the career path you want to take. It takes a certain type of person to sit patiently in front of a glowing screen for hours and studiously write code and actually enjoy the process.<p>If you want to build your own start-up ideas, don&#x27;t bother learning to develop. Save enough money and hire it. There&#x27;s very competent developers around the world that will make whatever you want (I am not saying its easy to find quality developers, but they are out there).<p>Personally, if I was in your shoes, I would give myself six months to really delve into the fundamentals. If by the end of six months, you feel its a chore and the thought of sitting in front of the screen for another couple of hours learning something else just turns you off, then please have the honesty to stop. But, if its the opposite and you are able to keep going then please don&#x27;t stop. I would say if you still have the drive to learn and practice after six months, you will be on your way to picking up whatever knowledge gaps you have.",1377147260

Taking a random example, OpenSSL&#x27;s EVP_CIPHER_CTX_block_size is a macro that simply returns an internal struct field; to call it from Go, it needs to be explicitly wrapped into a C function. I presume this is because cgo can&#x27;t infer the signature.<p>For other things, like some of the constants ncurses defines, it&#x27;s much less clear what&#x27;s going on (specifically, I had a hard time with any macro defined with the NCURSES_ACS macro, though that was pre-Go1 -- I believe cgo can now use these macros directly).<p>There&#x27;s an additional impedance mismatch when the C headers use macros for conditional compilation (for, e.g., cipher suites that can be optionally compiled out), but it&#x27;s not a worry if you either are conservative with the functionality you use, or control the packages installed on a system.<p>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to play with Rust yet, but since it uses C linkage directly for it&#x27;s FFI layer, I suspect these problems are less easily addressable.",1377146499

In fact I find software to be a far more attractive profession for women than other engineering branches.<p>In my total 4 years of engineering course. The branch with the least representation of girls was mechanical engineering, I say this because in all 4 years I didn&#x27;t see a single girl take up mechanical engineering, same with civil engineering. Electronic and Communication was a little better, the best was Computer science, which seem to have only girls.<p>But that&#x27;s sort of understandable, in the first year of engineering we had this subject called &#x27;machine shop&#x27;, you basically would have to build models with metal pieces, then there was a good enough amount of sheet metal work. You had to learn to use the hack saw, welding, soldering etc- there was also a good deal of carpentry. To give you a clue, even boys(most of them geeks and nerd types) from my branch(Electronics) found it exceedingly difficult to finish 40% of the models we were supposed to finish. They would be very physically tiring exercises, which we were never subjected to. Girls couldn&#x27;t manage even 10% of them, in fact many of us helped them personally so that they could get passing marks.<p>Now I understand why no girl would ever want to get into things like mechanical and civil engineering. You have to work in male dominated cultures, where the work is almost designed such that a man could excel doing it- while you struggle to catch up. And you will be facing outright physical limitations. Now imagine doing this for years, Its a deal breaker to even begin with.<p>Coming to programming, the problem begins only when the going gets tough. I&#x27;ve seen a good deal of representation of women in large companies. The problem starts when you get into the rockstar culture, where you are expected put 16 hrs/day + traveling as a norm. When you start depicting whole night &#x27;hackdays&#x27; as a sign of coolness. When learning new stuff needlessly happens just because its new etc. Now you are setting up a culture which is difficult for most women who have kids and family.",1377145448

And that was only because my Boss insisted since he refused to learn to use a command line.<p>It was normal for all of the machines to only have init, sshd (non-standard port, no password), iptables(it was a while ago, ok?), security measures such as fail2ban, monitoring scripts, and whatever service they were running.<p>That was usually it.  If I could strip any extraneous services that weren&#x27;t needed, I did so and saved the image as a template for next time.  My bosses loved me since when I started, most of the machines had 512Mb-1Gb of RAM allocated(mostly unused), and I managed to drop the necessary RAM down to about 128Mb for the services that didn&#x27;t require more.  Internal websites, DNS, etc.<p>Since We had a couple huge machines running most of the VMs, I also set up a pretty large dedicated RAID0 for /tmp space, and set the VMs to aggressively page to disk.  Our Giant Email server used to require 7+ Gigs of RAM for all of the work it did (We&#x27;re talking massive amounts of email constantly here, at least 20 domains serving multiple businesses), but I dropped it down to 2Gb.  No loss of reliability or noticeable speed, and it freed up lots of resources for other machines to use.<p>tl;dr  Linux Servers are usually as tiny as they can possibly be without affecting speed or reliability.  Also due to the sheer amount of tweaking you can usually get the most bang for your buck with only a week or two of tweaking.<p>MS Server needed at least 1Gb last I checked, but that was a while back.

Then think about the opposite: When all people are treated _completely_ equally by the government, which means that no business can get any sort of special advantage _at all_. In one of these situations, the economy will steadily decline into nothing. In the other, you have the best possible condition for economic growth. Our current system is highly mixed; literally, a mix of poison and medicine. How would the OP analyze this situation, and in which direction would he advocate going?

While I&#x27;ve enjoyed much of it, I also found a lot of it surprising to say the least.<p>What many people in finance haven&#x27;t realized is most of the industry is an IT problem. Much of the work I see involves ingesting data, analysing it, and reporting on it. Most everything else is sales.<p>Most of the people doing this work come from a finance background and only have a rudimentary understanding of IT or programming. Many know Excel and PowerPoint pretty well, and those tools are pushed to extremes.<p>The work I see being done by junior analysts is often manual IT work. You wouldn&#x27;t believe what goes on behind the scenes assembling the statements and reports that are sent to clients. It can be surprisingly difficult to sell software in this environment, because many stakeholders would rather get another junior analyst than solve the problem with software. There are some enlightened firms when it comes to technology, but I would say that is the exception.<p>Ultimately what I think is going to happen is that companies that are built from the ground up around a technology infrastructure will become more efficient and win business from traditional companies. It will take a long time to displace the bigger players, but it will happen. WealthFront is a good example of a financial company that is built around technology. Eventually these types of firms will win out in the market.<p>Update: Here is an example of the type of work I see analysts doing:<p>Manually copy data from 5 different systems into a spreadsheet at the end of the month. The data always has flaws, so go back and validate the data and resolve the issues. When the data is clean, do some processing on the data in the spreadsheet and create some graphs.<p>Then cut and paste output from the Excel spreadsheet into 150 client PowerPoint presentations, and combine that with commentary saved in an Word document from another department that is stored on a network drive.<p>At the end of the month an analyst will work 80 hour weeks to complete this in 3-5 business days.

I just won&#x27;t agree that eating Soylent on a regular basis is as healthy as taking your time and sharing non-McDonald&#x27;s meals with your friends and/or family.  Everyone has friends and family.  I guess I feel like Soylent is encouraging social isolation, and helping people to deprive themselves of the physical pleasure of eating.<p>I&#x27;ll also agree that spending hours a day preparing food sucks.  That&#x27;s for professional chefs and stay-at-home spouses to choose.  But a maximum average of an hour total per day is pretty reasonable in my opinion.",1377144481

6255076,comment,6253121,6254839,1,0,Ologn,,,"> According to some very sound economic currency theory, you&#x27;re 100% wrong.<p>I should first say that what that web site talks about is <i>not</i> a crank theory.  They base their arguments on what many consider a very sound economic currency theory.  I happen to disagree with the theory.  But you&#x27;re right in that the perceived value of Bitcoin is based on serious economic currency theory, which many prominent people consider very sound.<p>> About half the current value of a bitcoin is speculation. The rest is fundamentally supported by its trade volume<p>How much of the value of Pets.com, Webvan, eToys, Kozmo etc. was supported by trade volume in 1999?<p>> There is no way a bitcoin can crash unless its use in trade crashes.<p>I guess I agree - if people realize Bitcoin is worthless, they&#x27;ll stop trading with it.  The crash in price will be eventually followed by a slowdown in trading.<p>> The paper money I use every day, which can burn instantly in a flame, has no intrinsic value either.<p>I&#x27;ve talked about this in other places in this thread.  As five current US dollars could not buy one 1972 US dollar, as throughout history every government fiat currency in history has eventually collapsed in value (while gold has kept its value), as the current fiat experiment in the US is only 42 years old, in essence I agree over the long term.  US currency is completely based on the power of the US government and its willingness to support its currency.  Translated into what I have been saying, it means you can go to places like <a href=""http://www.usps.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usps.com</a> and send the government dollars, and it will send you valuable items in return.  You are right though that over the long term, US paper money has no intrinsic value.",1377144209

Looks like a repeat of the rumour going round during FOWA:<p><i>Some murmuring in the UK this this week says that Viacom is continuing its negotiations to buy Last.fm for approximately $450 million - a huge sum, but partly justified by the fact that Last.fm is really the ÂYouTube of musicÂ these days.</i><p><i>The royalty rate hike for online radio stations in the US, which is now being countered by a bill that aims to overturn it, doesnÂt seem to have affected the purchase price.</i><p><i>Based on a corroborating story from DealBreaker earlier this week, I guess we can upgrade this one from Âvague rumorÂ to ÂpossibilityÂ. More details appreciated. </i>",1177692994

17459,comment,17439,17439,0,0,mdakin,,,"No, but the answer is relative.  If you have a million dollars then $5,000 isn't ""expensive"" for the perfect name.  But if you have $20,000 spending $5,000 on the domain name would be insane.  <p>I just went through this myself.  I started negotiating with the squatter and I came to find out that we went to the same school and we travel in the same circles.  Even still we were not able to agree on the price so I walked away.<p>Last week I finally had a new inspiration for the name.  It's just one character longer than the perfect name.  I was able to buy .com .org and .net with this minor variation from a registrar (not a squatter)!<p>Keep thinking!",1177692093

17457,comment,17439,17439,0,0,pg,,,"Depends what you call expensive.<p>Our default advice is that buying domains doesn't work.
The owner either wants a ridiculous price, or doesn't want
to sell, or doesn't answer your emails.  There are also
plenty of good names still untaken.  We can often find one in a few minutes using instantdomainsearch.",1177691975

17449,comment,17439,17439,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"No - buying an expensive domain name is not increasing customer value when so many names are still available - use your money to make your application better.  My cofounder demanded a .com name, and I agreed - .com is the way to go as long as you can still find a suitable name.  For example, our company makes a project management application with the essential feature that it focuses on customer valuestreams.  After brainstorming for hours and bouncing around about 30+ different dot.com permutations (and using a thesaurus extensively as well as the greek-english dictionary) we ended up with the simple name:  StreamFocus.com  essentializing what our app does. (We just finalized the name last weekend)",1177691090

17443,comment,17439,17439,0,0,Tichy,,,"Another question: is it mandatory to have a .com domain name? I kind of feel it is, because otherwise your customers will just go to the .com domain even though they might have been looking for you. Perhaps one exception would be if the TLD somehow is part of the name? But even then, I wouldn't be sure.<p>On the other hand it seems inevitable that in the long run people will get used to other TLDs, because not every valid business will be able to aquire a good .com-name.

Something in me doesn't want to do it, but then again it is hard to find good names that aren't taken. 4500$ is too much for me at this stage of the project, but in principle?",1177690497

17438,comment,17416,17430,0,0,imp,,,"I feel for you.  When I wrote my first AJAX program, there was a lot of javascript controlling the UI.  It was almost complete before I looked at it in IE for the first time.  Two days and 10,000 alert boxes later I had it working.<p>It's a necessary evil.  No one enjoys it, but if you don't make the fixes you'll prevent a lot of people (including myself, a FF user) from ever even trying your website.  If I try it once and it completely breaks, I'm never going to come back.<p>If there are one or two non-critical features that are creating all of the bugs, then perhaps remove them initially and add them once you've fixed the compatibility bugs.",1177690172

However, <i>for fixing the problems listed in my post</i>, annotations are not a good solution for the reason I said above: they don&#x27;t condense the literature.

Mason gives a pretty good explanation of the legal differences between a K-9 officer already on the scene and the &quot;excessive prelongation of the search&quot; involved in calling for one.<p>> Dog sniffs are “sui generis,” the Court has held—they’re unique in that they don’t reveal any information about the contents of the object sniffed except the presence of contraband, as to which you have no privacy right. Thus, if the police have a dog ready to sniff your car when they pull you over for a traffic violation, you have no basis for objecting to the sniff. And, of course, if the dog does alert to the car, that is probable cause, so the police can then search the whole car. That’s what the officer wanted to do with Jay-Z, but the K-9 unit wasn’t there when he was pulled over, and was late arriving.",1429663506

They want to invest in enough risky things that the success of one or two of them is certain and more than covers the rest of the investments that didn&#x27;t pan out.<p>The problem with this is that works great when you have a large number of relatively cheap startups all trying to be the next app fad.  But that model fails miserably for anything that requires a large up-front investment that might not pay off. Nobody can afford to fund 100 Tesla&#x27;s and hope that one works. The initial cost is too large and the investment payoff will never cover the rest anyway.<p>And that&#x27;s why there aren&#x27;t many Teslas and there are thousands of social apps. Is that the desirable outcome that we&#x27;re trying to preserve using inequality?<p>Paul Graham is right in that if you tax wealthy people there will be less money for startups.  But whether that&#x27;s a good or bad thing considering the alternatives is another discussion.<p>There&#x27;s a neglected factor here, and that&#x27;s founder risk. If I have no money, I won&#x27;t be able to start a startup unless someone else gives me some; it&#x27;s too risky and I might starve quickly. But if my basic health and survival needs are met, there&#x27;s a lot less risk.  We don&#x27;t consider health care and welfare as enabler for growth in the U.S. but maybe we should.  How many college-grad founders would bootstrap companies if they didn&#x27;t have to worry about how to keep the lights on, and there was a potential for a long term payoff of a few million dollars?",1429662934
9418016,comment,9416546,9417918,0,0,vidarh,,,"Nothing stops you from using Docker containers as what you describe as &quot;system containers&quot;. The comparison you give to LXC is quite strange, given that Docker used to default to using LXC as it&#x27;s backend.<p>My most frequently used Docker container is primarily used for me to ssh in to a development environment that I use &quot;more or less as a VM environment&quot; and run multiple apps in, including sshd, screen and a ton of editors.<p>Other differences you give such as &quot;instances are ephemeral, persistent data is stored in bind mounts to host or data volume containers&quot; is only true if that is how you decide to use it. Data persists in a Docker container as long as you don&#x27;t destroy the container. E.g. there&#x27;s nothing special about a &quot;data volume container&quot; other than that you decide to not destroy it. The only reason some people like to make this distinction about app and data is that it allows you to destroy the container containing the application code (e.g. to upgrade it) without destroying the data. Or, if you go the bind mount route, and set things up accordingly you can e.g. blow away the entire /var/lib/docker whenever you feel like it (just mkfs&#x27;d an entire partition containing /var/lib/docker on a server earlier to clean up some cruft - service files restarted everything again shortly after I started Docker back up).<p>You can do the exact same thing with LXC if you want (including using &quot;data containers&quot; which are nothing but bind mounting parts of one container on top of parts of another). Unsuprisingly since Docker used to do the exact same thing using LXC as the backend mechanism.<p>Most of what you write about LXC as a &quot;system container&quot; holds only if you choose to install a full OS image as an LXC container, but LXC containers can just as well be only a single application if you prefer. LXC, like Docker, <i>doesn&#x27;t care</i> either way - it just sets up the environment and executes your specified application.<p>&quot;Docker restricts the container to a single process only&quot; is wrong, as you point out yourself, when you write that &quot;there is no way to run php-fpm, apache and mysqld in the same container without a shell script or install a separate process manager like runit or supervisor.&quot; Running a &quot;separate process manager&quot; is also exactly how you run more than a single process with LXC.",1429662933

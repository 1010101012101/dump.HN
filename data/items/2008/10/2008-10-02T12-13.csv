321647,comment,321346,321623,0,0,YogSothoth,,,"I don't doubt the CRA is part of it, but I think the fed lowering and lowering and lowering the prime rate after 9/11 in order the stimulate the economy figured prominently as well.<p>With interest rates low, banks have to be more aggressive in pursuing borrowers to maintain their same level of profitability (i.e. they'll start considering loaning to folks they'd normally not loan to).  Also, with interest rates low, there was a housing market boom which convinced a lot of people they could make money buying houses on credit and flipping them.<p>It makes you wonder if we'd have been better off if we'd have just let the economy recover on its own after 9/11.
The fed lowering the prime rate did hasten the onset of economic recovery 7 years ago, but look where we are now.",1222950691

Wether it be a long-term project or just some random script trying to achieve something it feels good to learn something new.<p>I also try to blog and write down my findings which helps me further understand everything especially when I get feedback.<p>This week I spent time getting dual monitors working on my Ubuntu partition. It was rough because my ATI card does not handle well on Linux so it took a lot of reading, trial and error, and understanding of how it all works. Now, I am writing this from Ubuntu and have my monitors working great.<p>It was essentially an assignment.

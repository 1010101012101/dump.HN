A dead-simple web IDE for asciidoc with live preview[1]<p>2. A script for checking for common AsciiDoc mistakes (e.g. an unterminated table will mess up all text following it).<p>3. A script which enforces the house style.<p>4. A makefile which runs docker (of course) to build the book with Manning styling.<p>5. A buildbot configuration on my server to run 2, 3 and 4 above on `git push` and move the generated pdf and docx into a directory served by nginx.<p>Though it may seem like a lot, this investment has been totally worth it - the ability to push a change and be viewing the updated pdf in ~1 minute is very liberating. I can&#x27;t imagine what it&#x27;d be like to not have this kind of thing in place.

It&#x27;s not as if existing rent control regulation catches landlords by surprise. If a prospective landlord is so unprepared as to be unaware of the rent control status of a property that he&#x27;s planning on purchasing, then he&#x27;s likely to do <i>very</i> poorly with pretty much all of the tasks that being a landlord requires of him.<p>In short, the fact that landlords rent out rent-controlled units is proof positive that they understand and <i>accept</i> the restraints imposed on them by rent control regulations. The fact that rent controlled apartments <i>continue</i> to be rented in SF (rather than withdrawn from the market for five years and converted into condos, as the law <i>allows</i>) is proof that rent control is not draining the lifeblood out of landlords.<p>The insane rents in SF are not due to rent control (how could they be?), but due to the pathological lack of new residential construction.",1426498718

In fact one of the first things I did was to figure out how to support multiline equations.<p>Turns out, you just need to write consecutive expressions one after another. Put ampersands in all these consecutive expressions and ScholarlyMarkdown will turn it into one giant align environment. If there is no ampersands, it generates a gather environment instead.<p>I apologize for this not being in the documentation. After all, I estimate that it is only about 30% complete. It really is in a dismal state. I originally didn&#x27;t expect much people to see the site until later this year when I plan to launch it. This will all be rectified eventually, promise!<p>Here is literally a large align-block example straight out of the thesis that I&#x27;m currently busy working on (instead of the documentation).

Scholdoc simply put those default setting there for convenience; you&#x27;re not tied to it at all.<p>Why put the number on the left side by default? Think of what happens when you have a long equation, and when you&#x27;re trying to read it on a narrow screen such as a phone. If the number was on the right, it may very well be cut-off by the screen, forcing you to scroll around to find equations. Sometimes layout decisions that made sense for paper for centuries doesn&#x27;t make sense for screens.<p>I should point out that Scholdoc is only using MathJax on the HTML side for consistency; there is no technical reason why it can&#x27;t use another renderer that understands LaTeX, but so far MathJax is the only one that even comes close to supporting all standard AMS features.

Is it really that much harder to make it work across at least the big email providers, while still being able to remove that setting-up the private key and sharing the public key confusion that people get when using PGP? Or is it more of a political/collaboration issue (the big companies don&#x27;t want to work together on this)?",1426496689

The trade offs of structure & abandon can work at many scales, you don&#x27;t have to be Google to do it. Likewise Redis[2] has largely been the work of a single developer, and isn&#x27;t reckless.<p>Now while Minecraft is a toy and Notch likely didn&#x27;t start out with the thought to develop it into a business, that doesn&#x27;t mean the value of its code is worthless. Yes the tradeoffs are there, but we shouldn&#x27;t get carried away and start to believe you can only write &quot;good&quot; code if you have a thousand engineers.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.tgdaily.com/business-and-law-features/36436-tim-sweeney-part-3-unreal-engine-40-aims-at-next-gen-console-war"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tgdaily.com/business-and-law-features/36436-tim-s...</a>\n[2]<a href=""https://github.com/antirez/redis/graphs/contributors"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/antirez/redis/graphs/contributors</a>",1426496660

9210470,comment,9207028,9210397,0,0,einrealist,,,"For me it is exactly the other way around. I hated those weekly 3hr status meetings. Sometimes, I fell asleep. And I hated that all the specifications had to be upfront, without flexibility for the team or the stakeholder. Nothing was more counterproductive than implementing a solution, that when I knew half-way in that it was flawed.<p>With Scrum, if something bugs me, I bring it up. We do standups only if required (put a signal on the board). Meetings have a single goal and having it as a ritual (culture) helps to accept it. My team is not always the exact amount of people. People get sick or have holidays or just migrate into other teams. If my team needs a specialist for something, we bring someone on board for the required time. But we also try to share knowledge and not to specialize, because that would be a risk (sickness, holidays, termination etc). We also learned to break down requirements into stories that are small enough, so we can reason about it. We understand Scrum as a foundation that we can agree on. And if we disagree, we figure out how to change the boundaries of Scrum so we can move on.",1426496536

If your tenant isn&#x27;t doing anything that you can evict them for, that&#x27;s too bad for you as the landlord. When a landlord rents out his property as a home for another, that property becomes the lessee&#x27;s castle. In all but a very few aspects, that property is now effectively the lessee&#x27;s to use in any and all ways that comport with their leasing agreement.<p>> What if the landlord wants somewhere for their aging grandmother to live so they can care for her?<p>In California, there is a legal way to do this. It&#x27;s one of the ways that the Ellis Act permits landlords to evict rent-controlled tenants.<p>The Ellis Act is a pretty fair and just law. It recognizes that landlords are human, and might have real reasons to get out of the property rental market. (Or that they might need to use their only rental unit to house themselves and their family.) It also recognizes that <i>some</i> all-too-human landlords do try to maximize their profit margins despite the very real damage that they would do to the lives of others.",1426496410

Considering the SSL issues which apparently weren&#x27;t tested properly and the immediately published feedback that shows tons of private data from people, I really, really hope that the site won&#x27;t be hacked in the next month or two.

And if Mike would have spotted the (other) more obvious loophole, which is to store input data in only the filenames, he could have given this (possibly the only) sensible answer: &quot;Yes, multiple files whose summed up size + the size of the decompressor are smaller than the original file are ok. But the files must be uniquely named inputfile.0 ... inputfile.NNN.&quot; Which  is exactly what Patrick delivered.",1425808734

It&#x27;s a bit of a double-edged sword though, as sometimes people pause videos to not be distracted, and that sort of flickering back and forth would certainly distract me if I still had the window visible.<p>16: cool<p>15: This would be interesting to integrate with what happens when you actually click a link and it&#x27;s still working on getting there, especially if you pulled your mouse away from the link before the actual page had resolved in DNS (I think that&#x27;s when the URI changes on link click? I&#x27;m not sure, honestly and that&#x27;s an assumption)<p>14: Neat trick and very pretty<p>13: I like how the length of the arrows increases as the system processes. As long as it&#x27;s not an indeterminate progress bar (I don&#x27;t know how that would be represented in this model, but that doesn&#x27;t matter since it doesn&#x27;t have to be), that is a beautiful way to do it. I like it.<p>12: I like it, as long as you could start typing during the animation. I don&#x27;t like having to wait.<p>11: standard. good. I like it.<p>10: It could be useful<p>9: If that&#x27;s what the client wants, then that&#x27;s great! I certainly think it&#x27;s cool.<p>8: I&#x27;m a bit conflicted with this one. On one hand, it&#x27;s a neat trick, and exploding out at the same time as shrinking in (in the center) looks nice; but at the same time, it might get a bit old? I dunno.<p>7: I don&#x27;t think this is rendering right on Chrome... it either has a very long animation loop, or I&#x27;m not seeing the whole thing? The button kinda gets a boil around it somewhat, or part of the way? My computer may be slowing down when trying to render it.<p>6: This looks like a lot of ones that already exist except more animated maybe? I find it interesting; but, I think my OCD would get frustrated since the change happens /after/ I get to the place I want to be, not at the same time. I&#x27;d end up jabbing the down or up button longer than intended. Eh.<p>5: there&#x27;s a lot of circular activity in these options. I think I would prefer to see the button just grow in all directions at the same rate and disappear where it wasn&#x27;t finished, if I were going this route; but, I&#x27;m not sure. It&#x27;s okay, and something I&#x27;d tolerate if a phone OS already had it, but not something I&#x27;d add myself.<p>4: I don&#x27;t know what this is meant for, so I can&#x27;t comment<p>3: I&#x27;m going to guess there is a text box that would grow to the right side of this icon? I like reusing the icon as both a start search and stop search. Very nice.<p>2: It may just be my machine, but the graph line changes speed. I don&#x27;t like that. Is it going at the same speed just laterally, making the line seem to speed up since it has to cover more distance for the rises and falls? If so, then that&#x27;s okay I guess? It still feels hasty and upsetting.<p>1: I like the spinner. Could it just be 2 rotations instead of 3? Oh, I get it, grow, be one size, shrink. Nevermind, 3 is fine. I wonder what it would look like if it were extend to its proper size at the start of its first rotation, make a whole rotation and then shrink. I wonder how that would go. I like how it is right now, though :)<p>All in all, some cool ideas, many of them useful :)<p>[As an aside, 7->0 don&#x27;t seem to load on Firefox 36.0.1, so I had to look at them in Chrome. I&#x27;m not sure why it wouldn&#x27;t work in Firefox.]",1425808734

I was lucky to work closely with a couple of young engineers; programming Z80s, wire-wrapping prototypes.  When the www came online, my engineer colleagues had me working on our first company web-page, so that got me introduced to html/javascript/css.<p>Enrolled in CS program at uni in 2000, got a programming job with a company building an &quot;online shopping mall&quot; (in the model of [Shopify](<a href=""http://shopify.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shopify.com</a>).  The lead-programmer there was 19, I was 26.  I started learning MySQL on day 1.  Introduced OO-perl to young kid. I implored my boss-at-the-time &quot;we need to hire some young CS grads, and he did.  One guy in particular was much more talented all-around, I found, so I quickly encouraged him to take the reins and lead us.<p>I&#x27;ve been self-incorporated and working from home for ~5 years now.  I specialize in Ruby, Rails, complex Javascript SPAs and Cordova (including custom plugins on the native Android & iOS side).<p>I made a name for myself in the Sencha/ExtJS universe (which is fading now), but I got a lot of work directed at me by taking part in that community.<p>I&#x27;ve always been pretty active in OSS projects and I&#x27;m always managing some of my own for niche applications, which seem to gather a small audience.  That&#x27;s been pretty important over the years, getting someone hooked on your OSS code.<p>If you&#x27;re doing Cordova apps and you need battery-efficient background location-tracking on iOS/Android, Google: &quot;background geolocation&quot;, I might be the 1st couple results :)<p>I don&#x27;t really do much hunting for jobs these days, they come to me instead (so far).  When my plate is full, I raise my rate higher as a filter.<p>I should add, while I don&#x27;t have a CS degree, I did have 1 year college electronics in addition to 3 years of vocational high-school electronics which gave me the fighting chance.",1425808026

9165146,comment,9164580,9164580,0,0,pedalpete,,,"I don&#x27;t have a degree, and have been a software developer for over 8 years. All self-taught on the internet.<p>I work for a technology research agency, with some absolutely amazing engineers. Former googlers, top of the field stuff. Though sometimes they are speaking far above my current knowledge, the fact that I don&#x27;t have a degree is never an issue. It&#x27;s just that I haven&#x27;t learned x or y YET. Most of the stuff I&#x27;m learning from them, I don&#x27;t think most CS students would have learnt either. I&#x27;m incredibly lucky.<p>The great thing about it all, is that I also don&#x27;t have the rules instilled in me, which they have. Which (I think) is why I&#x27;m sometimes able to come up with more elegant solutions to problems than they are. I always say, &quot;I&#x27;m not smarter than them, but I may be more creative&quot;.<p>Though the research agency asked if I had a degree, it was never an issue for them. The interesting thing is that the companies that I had spoken to who were adamant that their engineers had degrees where doing the least interesting and challenging stuff. The really interesting stuff, people would ask why I don&#x27;t have a degree, but once they saw the history of work, and example of my code, that was it. It never came up again.<p>So, I think it might depend on what type of developer you are. If you&#x27;re going to work for digital agencies, it might matter. If you&#x27;re going to work for people without a technical background (who don&#x27;t understand that a degree maybe doesn&#x27;t mean that much), you might need one. If you&#x27;re able to teach yourself enough to be more than dangerous, make a few really interesting and challenging projects come off, and most importantly, surround yourself with people you can continue to learn from, I think you&#x27;ll be ok.<p>It seemed to me, when I was interviewing, that the importance of a degree was in inverse correlation to your expectations.",1425807823

It can be random looking, you can run some statistic analysis on the byte sequence and say &quot;It&#x27;s probably generated by some good random algorithm&quot;, but even here &quot;probably&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean any probability in [0,1].<p>Also there are cases in practice where you expect back the same random byte sequences even if they are randomly generated.

9165112,comment,9164881,9164881,0,0,Chevalier,,,"&quot;The new digital credentials can solve this problem by providing exponentially more information. Think about all the work you did in college. Unless you’re a recent college graduate, how much of it was saved and archived in a way that you can access now? What about the skills you acquired in various jobs? Digital learning environments can save and organize almost everything. Here, in the “unlabeled” folder, are all of my notes, tests, homework, syllabus and grades from the edX genetics course. My “real” college courses, by contrast, are lost to history, with only an inscrutable abbreviation on a paper transcript suggesting that they ever happened at all.&quot;<p>Exactly. On the merits, a MOOC degree ought to be infinitely more worthwhile than any traditional college degree. MOOC completion (quite literally) demonstrates project work, practical skills, attendance, and interaction. The courses themselves are the highest quality in the world and the rigor and impartiality is available for all the world to see. In a sane world, MOOCs will inherit global education.<p>But the world hasn&#x27;t caught up yet. Right now the only commonly understood credential is the college degree, which everyone knows can be accomplished through registering for bullshit courses, skipping class, plagiarizing occasional essays nobody will ever read, and earning a one-word major that does nothing to prove any actual skills. Historically, this is as good as we&#x27;ve been able to do. No longer.<p>Give it time. There are entrenched interests here -- not only the massive and powerful education industry, which is now obsolete, but also every existing college graduate whose expensive credentials are now threatened by the radically superior MOOC certificate. Not to pick on teacher unions in particular, but several states require infamously pointless masters degrees in education before you can teach. Lawyers likewise REALLY don&#x27;t need a three-year JD before we can practice... and the US stands alone in requiring bachelor&#x27;s degrees prior to legal training or bar passage (with the exception of California). Virtually any non-STEM job that requires a bachelor&#x27;s can be filled without the aid of expensive four-year certificates in poetry or pottery or communications. That&#x27;s an enormous threat to basically every working professional in the United States.<p>Employ the D.E.N.N.I.S. system here.<p>First, demonstrate the value of MOOC certificates to employers.<p>Second, engage employers with hiring pipelines direct from Coursera/Udacity/edX.<p>Third, nurture these pipelines and grow them into a viable Github-for-employment.<p>Fourth, neglect protests from existing interests that have demanded advanced degrees in &quot;teaching MOOCs&quot; (seriously) or jeers that MOOC completion rates are low.<p>Fifth, inspire students with visible examples of success through MOOCs. Thiel fellows are the closest to this, but the project more closely resembles a lottery than a structured path.<p>Sixth, separate MOOCs entirely from their current aping of traditional courses. There is no reason whatsoever to release courses on a real-time basis, or to rely on artisanal videotaped lectures. (Though MOOCs have admittedly improved dramatically on the latter, with faster speeds, transcripts, open courseware, etc.)<p>Or... just withdraw federal subsidies for student loans and make host institutions partially liable for student defaults. I&#x27;d love to see the argument to pay $50k/year to attend no-name for-profit ripoffs in the middle of nowhere, versus free attendance in every Harvard course at any Starbucks in New York City.",1425806743

Wholesale refusal to discuss internally rational lines of thought is the result of dogma, not rationality, which would calmly approach and deconstruct the topic. Unlike many others, whether I ultimately agree or not, I&#x27;m not willing to discard a point of view just because an activist attempts to proclaim it thoughtcrime by slapping a label on the speaker like &quot;bigot&quot;. What are you afraid to address? As PG&#x27;s essay says, if the thought is actually outlandish, no one really cares -- hostility like this only emerges if there is concern that the line of thought will become widespread, which is only a concern when the line of thought is internally rational.<p>I guess your argument is &quot;the APA says they&#x27;re wrong&quot;, and that therefore, they should not be tolerated? No one could ever rationally doubt the APA? I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re familiar with the history on it, but the removal of homosexuality as a disorder from the DSM was based purely on politics; there was no paper that triggered scientific reconciliation, there was no new data. Since the APA has insisted on calling into question the licensing of persons who may dare to contradict it on this matter, you can&#x27;t honestly believe that the issue has been thoroughly explored or reviewed, just as we don&#x27;t believe that the 99.9% election results in favor of third-world despots actually reflect the will of the people. Regardless of your personal feelings, a person can&#x27;t look at this process, decide they disagree with the APA&#x27;s conclusion, and continue to have the right to work?<p>Personally, agreement with all APA policies is not one of the fundamental requirements I look for in my job candidates that have nothing whatsoever to do with the field of psychology, but to each his own, I guess. Remember, you&#x27;re not just saying these people &quot;are wrong&quot; or &quot;have lost&quot;, but that their beliefs are so troublesome that they shouldn&#x27;t be protected in their freedom to work.<p>American principles of tolerance and civil discourse are greatly imperiled by the rising prominence of such hostile positions, and <i>democracy itself</i> is threatened by this behavior.<p>PG stops at murder because it&#x27;s one of the only moral standards that is practically constant. You stop at &quot;lesser human beings&quot; because it&#x27;s convenient for the line of propaganda you&#x27;ve swallowed. Should we allow the mentally disabled or decrepit full freedom lest they be considered &quot;lesser human beings&quot;? Should all parents of Downs Syndrome or other profoundly retarded children be deprived of their supervisory and guardianship privileges over adult children lest these be classified &quot;lesser human beings&quot;? Why is it OK for them to be lesser but not others? There are very few answers you can provide here that are consistent with the moral box you&#x27;ve crafted for yourself.<p>Consider where your assertion that most antebellum Southerners were frankly evil leads. Where <i>did</i> it lead? People in both the North and the South got worked up about this and stirred to believe things like you just claimed about the opposite side. What&#x27;s the logical result if you honestly believe &quot;a majority&quot; of persons that adhere to an opposing ideology are frankly evil?<p>Aren&#x27;t you automatically classifying people as &quot;lesser human beings&quot; by stating that their opinions are not worthy of basic respect, and wouldn&#x27;t that make you a hypocrite? Should anyone who holds these opinions be executed?<p>If we acknowledge that almost all significant world religions espouse very different perspectives than you&#x27;ve expressed, would you support doing something about that? Perhaps we should outlaw these religious groups. What should we do with the people who refuse to recant their religious traditions? Should they be incarcerated? Perhaps a labor camp of some type would be useful for this. What do you say? How much value is the work of frankly evil people, like those who express a belief in Abrahamic tradition, anyway? Wouldn&#x27;t you always be afraid they were going to do some sneaky, evil thing? The uses for this class are rapidly dwindling. What next?<p>This sort of hate always leads in the same direction. Do not make the mistake of believing that while everyone who has done similar things throughout history was bad, YOUR beliefs are objectively righteous, and that makes it OK for you. It really doesn&#x27;t matter what the beliefs are or whether they are objectively right or not once they infect someone with the actual hatred you&#x27;ve expressed (not the &quot;hatred&quot; that your camp claims motivates anyone who dissents for any reason), the results are never pretty. I hope you awaken to this before it&#x27;s too late.",1425805327

I learned a great deal in my university career, and much of what I learned in the humanities took real intellectual curiosity, hard work, and deep thinking. You&#x27;re not going to put together a real, publishable work by copy and pasting work from Stackoverflow, not in a master level English course. And let&#x27;s be honest, the majority of CS students are lazy and incompetent, just like the majority of all students in all majors. Sure, you get some truly brilliant students that come along, but most of them never really produce anything of value. And most engineers, talented as they may be at slinging code and doing the lambda calculus, are pitiful communicators and can barely write a coherent sentence.",1401375490

This is not <i>even remotely true</i>. Read the Friedman column for yourself:<p>> <i>Are the liberal arts still important?</i><p>> \n> <i>They are “phenomenally important,” he said, especially when you combine them with other disciplines. “Ten years ago behavioral economics was rarely referenced. But [then] you apply social science to economics and suddenly there’s this whole new field. I think a lot about how the most interesting things are happening at the intersection of two fields.</i><p>So basically, the OP basis for argument is a little off-kilter. But where the OP is incredibly wrong is his interpretation of the following:<p>> <i>I told that student they are much better off being a B student in computer science than an A+ student in English because it signals a rigor in your thinking and a more challenging course load.</i><p>The OP is aggreieved because he interprets Bock&#x27;s statement as saying that English doesn&#x27;t have the same critical thinking skills as computer science. Bock is not saying that at all, he is saying to a student that leaving comsci, because the courses are too challenging, is a bad idea, and that he/she shouldn&#x27;t prize an A in an &quot;easier&quot; curriculum over a B in computer science, because the value of a grade is not the only measure of skills valuable to Google.<p>What&#x27;s really important here is the word that Bock uses: &quot;rigor&quot;. I&#x27;ll refer to the definition that Google&#x27;s search engine brings up:<p>> <i>the quality of being extremely thorough, exhaustive, or accurate.</i><p>The OP interprets &quot;rigor&quot; as being &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;challenging.&quot; But Bock is more likely referring to the importance of <i>accuracy</i> and the more rigidly testable questions in a typical computer science curriculum versus an English curriculum. Bock does not at all talk about the intellectual challenge of English versus Computer Science.<p>The fact that a professor has such a skewed, and in my opinion, <i>wrong</i> interpretation of not just Bock&#x27;s statement, but of the English word &quot;rigor&quot; is itself a testament to the lack of &quot;rigor&quot;...or &quot;stiffness&quot; in how English is evaluated.",1401375470

Not a big deal, but ever so slightly insulting that you have to deal with them.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure you have realized the true power of git branching.<p>Here is our typical workflow at work:<p>1. Branch master to topic/feature branch<p>2. Work on feature branch, push feature branch to remote<p>3. Push of feature branch to remote triggers a Tddium test run.<p>4. Deploy feature branch to a staging server for internal review.<p>5. Make fixes, adjustments to feature branch and push to remote, which triggers more Tddium test builds.<p>6. Once things are looking good, we pull --rebase master, which pulls down everyone elses changes to master.<p>7. Rebase the feature branch off of master, resolve any conflicts.<p>8. Merge feature branch into master and push.<p>Above, branching allowed me to:<p>* Save my own personal branches to a remote repo where they are backed up,<p>* Offload my test suite to a 3rd party,<p>* Allow me to deploy a feature branch to a staging server all without messing with the master branch at all.<p>I can also squash or rename commits on my branch easily and cherry-pick other commits from other branches without worrying about master. I can also VERY EASILY switch to other branches to work on other features and bugfixes as they arise. I normally work on 2-4 diff branches per day.\nTry doing any of that in SVN and be in for fun ride...",1401375442

Just before I started at my state university, it added a writing test that all students had to pass before receiving a degree because employers complained about the lack of writing skills. Several years in, most people were still failing on their first try.<p>Unfortunately, writing doesn&#x27;t have debugging tools, tests and output for feedback to let you know if what you put together works. Rather, you need someone who is a good writer to provide honest feedback.<p>Also difficult is that developing good writing skills requires good instructors / mentors. I have had too many writing classes with instructors who would give praise for just about anything. All of my instructors in my first year of taking writing classes told me how great I was. It wasn&#x27;t until I took a technical writing class in which my first paper came back a mess of red ink that I finally felt like I was learning something. That class was one of the most valuable I have ever taken. She told us at the beginning of the class that few people can write well, we probably won&#x27;t ever be able to write well either (true for me,) but she would help us become passable enough to get through the writing test.<p>Granted, most writing classes don&#x27;t focus on the same items as technical writing. But with as much effort as this instructor put into every one of my papers, this can&#x27;t be something many instructors are willing to do.<p>How do you become a good writer and get good feedback? I don&#x27;t know.<p>Compare this to many other classes in which the instructor is largely a guide and you do most or all of your learning on your own.<p>ETA: I think the instructor and the quality of the course is extremely important. Many subjects in college can be setup to be easy to coast through or rigorous. The name on the course isn&#x27;t as important as the contents.",1401374635

The best source I know of for this information is the <i>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual</i> (<a href=""http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-optimization-manual.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/...</a>). It is fairly vague about what the instruction does, but gives some useful information in 13.5.3 &quot;Spin-Wait Loops&quot;, as well as 8.4 &quot;Thread Synchronization&quot;, and in particular 8.4.2 &quot;Synchronization for Short Periods&quot; which says:<p>&quot;On a modern microprocessor with a superscalar speculative execution engine, [a spin loop] results in the issue of multiple simultaneous read requests from the spinning thread. These requests usually execute out-of-order with each read request being allocated a buffer resource. On detection of a write by a worker thread to a load that is in progress, the processor must guarantee no violations of memory order occur. The necessity of maintaining the order of outstanding memory operations inevitably costs the processor a severe penalty that impacts all threads.&quot;<p>So it seems that the concern here is that (without a PAUSE) the speculative execution engine effectively unrolls the spin loop and executes a sequence of reads on the sequence variable. This queues up a list of pending memory operations that need to be unrolled <i>in order</i> to ensure that the result is the same as if they were executed sequentially -- even though in this case it wouldn&#x27;t make any difference.",1401374523

Back in the 19th century it was more common to play things out to the bitter end. I bet you would find that frequency of checkmate is negatively correlated with rating, too.<p>The fact that game length has increased is most likely attributable to extended endgames (I presume). Thus I would expect this to drive frequency of captures down (as you observed), not up; there are a finite number of pieces to be captured, so longer endgames will result in fewer pieces being captured per move.<p>The curves of piece movement frequency are interesting. The &quot;popularity&quot; seems to be a conflation of how much those pieces are moved and how little they are captured, though. If a piece is captured it can&#x27;t move for the rest of the game and will thus appear to be less &quot;popular&quot;.<p>I am as curious as you as to why the rook, knight and pawn curves change the way they do. Of course the changes are less dramatic than they appear on the graph (around 5% variation), but that&#x27;s still interesting. I am sure that they are not the results of an 1850s book on rook strategy and Fischer changing chess as we know it, though!<p>It would be interesting to see the same curves when considering only the first 40 moves or so of each game. Once you reach the endgame, you&#x27;re going to be moving the pieces you have left, whether you like it or not, and that can last for a lot of moves.",1401373914

I have a Black[1] grandfather but look either Italian, Hispanic, or Sephardic Jewish. This led to me incorrectly identifying what race I was and mostly being annoyed by the question[2]. For example, when I applied to MIT I agonized over what to put and just decided to check both &quot;white&quot; and &quot;African-American&quot; and call it a day. When graduation was coming up, I got an email about a kente stole ceremony and...felt awkward. Aside from doing this one small not-valuable program with the Office of Minority Education, I didn&#x27;t really participate in black life at MIT at all. This was also around the time when people were having a bunch of discussions about Treyvon Martin and white privilege and I realized that the things people were talking about the experience of growing up as a black man in America did not match mine at all. Basically, it wasn&#x27;t until senior year that I realized that I was probably white and had white privilege.<p>I had some trouble accepting this, as identifying as white felt a bit like a betrayal of my mother and grandfather. So, I started reading a bunch of books like How to be Black, The Souls of Black Folk, and How the Irish became White[3]. I learned some pretty interesting things[4] and accepted that in almost[5] all contexts I am white. if someone (like a friend of mine from Canarsie) says I&#x27;m Black, thats fine.

I play the Bodhrán, have been known to jig and sing folk songs, have marched in a clan rally in Co. Longford.\n[4] Did you know that 7 out of Homer Plessey&#x27;s 8 grandparents were white and his legal team had to specifically arrange for him to be arrested and charged with violating the Louisiana railroad segregation statute in order to start the legal challenge that unfortunately led to the &quot;Separate but Equal&quot; ruling?\n[5] Exception: watching 12 Years a Slave with my mother.",1401373892

Insurance against low-probability, high-cost events is rational. (In this case, it&#x27;s even worse than insuring yourself because insurers make money when you don&#x27;t have an accident, banks make money when you do, so the incentives are totally misaligned: banks actively try to make it hard for you not to screw up.)<p>2. If you have a couple of thousand dollars in the bank and you&#x27;re getting an extra 0.5% on your interest, that&#x27;s $10 per year. That&#x27;s far less than the time-cost of just reading your bank&#x27;s fee schedule every time they change it.<p>The fact is, retail banks make most of their money by charging fees which come as a surprise to the people who pay them.

There's a lot of coal in some so-called swing states, and coal miners and their friends and neighbors are part of the demographic that have been voting Republican on ""social"" issues but are now swinging Democratic on ""Bush is utterly incompetent"" issues.  Proposing a program to transition the country to coal powered electric cars would go over well with this group.<p>To the rest of the country, it could be sold as more pragmatic than trying to generate all our energy from solar and wind in the near term, while still offering a path to energy independence.  They could play up arguments about how coal generated electricity is already less carbon emitting than the gasoline engines in autos.<p>This might not be as easy a position to take for Democrats, because the staunch environmentalists on their side may not be happy about increased coal burning.",1211900159
201020,comment,200728,200823,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Usually you use the factory pattern because you want to customize the concrete type of object that's instantiated, correct?  In Python, you'd just pass the class itself in, and since every class is a callable that constructs an instance of itself when called, you can use that to control instantiation:<p><pre><code>   class Foo: ...
   class Bar: ...
   def factory_client(cls):
      my_instance = cls()
      ...
      return my_instance

   foo_instance = factory_client(Foo)
   bar_instance = factory_client(Bar)

On average you could extract more energy from coal by using the trace amount of fissionable material in coal than you get by setting the stuff on fire.<p>(<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power</a>) <i>As of 2004, nuclear power provided 6.5% of the world's energy...</i> <i>At this point, the enriched uranium, containing more than the natural 0.7% U-235, is used to make rods of the proper composition and geometry for the particular reactor that the fuel is destined for. The fuel rods will spend about 3 operational cycles (typically 6 years total now) inside the reactor, generally until about 3% of their uranium has been fissioned, then they will be moved to a spent fuel pool where the short lived isotopes generated by fission can decay away. After about 5 years in a cooling pond, the spent fuel is radioactively and thermally cool enough to handle, and it can be moved to dry storage casks or reprocessed.</i> <i>As opposed to current light water reactors which use uranium-235 (0.7% of all natural uranium), fast breeder reactors use uranium-238 (99.3% of all natural uranium). It has been estimated that there is up to five billion years’ worth of uranium-238 for use in these power plants.[33]</i><p>PS: The five billion year figure makes some assumptions about the rate of use but once you start looking into the numbers it's far enough into the future that our predictions are just about meaningless.<p>Edit: There are a lot of odd regulations and political history around whey we do it this way but long term supply is not the real issue with fission.",1211898733

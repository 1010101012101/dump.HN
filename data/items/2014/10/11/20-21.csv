8443421,comment,8442036,8443199,0,0,disallusioned42,,,"I&#x27;m assuming that most people are more interested in happy marriages than stable ones (at least before they&#x27;ve made the commitment).  Now the marriage traditionalists might not.  (This seems to be supported by at least one or two of the people posting here.  But at the same time, one of them still mentions &quot;happily-ever-after&quot;.)  Even going back to the Declaration of Independence we see &quot;pursuit of happiness&quot; mentioned prominently in even those much more conservative times.  Going significantly farther back than that I can start to see how &quot;stable&quot; might be significant, but in this day and age &quot;happy&quot; seems like a safe bet.<p>On the other side we have the word &quot;divorce&quot;, which everyone agrees means &quot;definitely unhappy&quot;.  However, &quot;not divorced&quot; is definitely not a sufficient condition for &quot;happy&quot;.  The word &quot;stable&quot; is in the middle and can go either way.  In one sense I agree it has a strong similarity to &quot;not divorced&quot;.  But in another sense, I think a lot of people read &quot;stable marriage&quot; as being very similar to &quot;happy marriage&quot;.  So to the extent that stable == happy, it&#x27;s missing the point of the actual stats.  And to the extent that stable != happy and a good proxy for not divorced, it&#x27;s missing the point of what people really want out of life (and marriage).<p>This brings us to your response to my other comment, and there I think you&#x27;re right on the money.  The purpose of marriage is the main issue here.  In my mind, the traditional view is synonymous with &quot;stable&quot; and not getting divorced.  And the fact that the OP is talking about &quot;stable&quot; and &quot;divorce&quot; in the way it is suggests that the traditional view of marriage is a strong influence (although maybe my religious background is biasing me here).  But none of this is very relevant if &quot;happy&quot; is what people are really after.",1413060992

We came back home with source code and executables, but missing the VB6 runtime and disappointed that we couldn&#x27;t continue working on our programs. We even made screensavers!

Their managers were trying cut off financially as much as they can to save some more money in the department so that managers can get extra money at the end of year depending on the savings.<p>This caused employees more stress, more work, less comfort and less time with family.

To go beyond text communication, that&#x27;s why <i>Instagram</i> is popular even though its photo editing capabilities are less expansive and sophisticated than your camera + GIMP. Social media sites demand little from the producer and the consumer, which is partially why we are so inclined to spend time there instead of writing full blog posts or letters to Mom.<p>Should society just acclimate itself to be less reactionary to social media quips? Sure, but that&#x27;s a bit of begging the question there. Social media networks are so strong because they can cause such emotional reaction for such little energy input. I&#x27;m not an evolutionary biologist, but I halfway assume that there&#x27;s something physiologically appealing about the whole process, and that something would fight back against the ability for society to collectively take a deep breath and patiently consume the stream of social media.<p>You and I want both the same thing: patience and empathy in civic discourse. But you have more faith than I do that it can/should happen even when the scales are so lopsided: physically, it gets easier and easier to make and disseminate our thoughts, but our ability to physically process such information does not scale as well.",1413059110

Belonging to a church, having 200+ people attend your cheap wedding -- these are situations in which you know a lot of people, who might be helpful to you when the marriage gets tough. You can talk to your grandma about the three years in which she really wanted to divorce grandpa, but they stuck it out and things got much better when x happened. You can call your cousin and ask him if he can take the kids for the evening because your wife is sick and you can&#x27;t deal with everyone and everything at once. You can borrow a car from your fellow choir member, or you can vent about your relationship stress or how you hate your kids that week.<p>Social supports smooth out money problems, health problems, and relationship problems. Money+health problems are the number one cause of divorce in America (that is, money discussions are the number one marriage stressor in the US, and health problems are the number one cause of bankruptcy in the US). If your parents/church/friends/cousins can help out with a loan/childcare/outright monetary gifts when certain economic or health sh&t goes down, your marriage is more likely to survive.

And anyone could write an app to run on DOS or Windows. For the time it was a remarkably free wheeling and open system, especially compared to what other companies like Apple was doing. And let us not forget that it was the success and growth of the open PC which made it possible for linux to come along and put itself on the same hardware. MS has certainly been guilty of various unfair business practices from time to time, and from trying to use its power to gain unfair advantage in the market, but for the most part I think that behavior tends to be the exception over Microsoft&#x27;s history.

That says that if you distribute the software, and your distribution of the software relies on patents that you either hold or license from someone else, you must either pass along the rights in those licenses (if possible), or give up the patent license (that is, if you have licensed a patent from someone but don&#x27;t have the ability to transfer that license to downstream recipients, than you may only distribute the software if you give up that patent license, putting you and your users on equal footing if the holder of the patent decides to enforce it).<p>The DRM clause may also bother them, but I doubt that they would avoid using software due to it, since it only applies to software which is itself used as part of a DRM system, saying that it can&#x27;t be considered an effective technological measure (as the other freedoms provided by the GPL allow users to replace it), and so none of the legally enforced restrictions on removing DRM can apply. Since that only applies to code that is used as part of a DRM system itself, I don&#x27;t think that would cause them particular problems, as long as they avoid linking any of their DRM systems to GPLed code, but there may be cases in which it would come up.<p>Anyhow, I can&#x27;t really say which of these is the reason that they don&#x27;t allow it, as they have never made any public statements about that. My guess would be the patent clause, followed by the Tivoization clause, followed by the DRM cluase, in order of importance.",1413058023

8443299,comment,8442502,8442502,0,0,andrewflnr,,,"There are a couple related issues at hand. I agree that hedging and weasel phrases are an issue. It&#x27;s too easy to write content-free noise. The classic example in my mind is someone trying to sound &quot;deep&quot; who makes a statement like &quot;Sometimes X...&quot; without saying anything about how to identify such times out what to do about them. However, when this is a problem, it&#x27;s one of not enough precision, not too much. The goal is to try to write a statement that fits all possible evidence, and so can&#x27;t be proven wrong, ignoring that it&#x27;s useless for the same reason.<p>Defensive writing, on the other hand, is generally a good thing. Precision and careful logic are essential in writing. We don&#x27;t have the benefit of physical emotional cues. Common sense isn&#x27;t common, and even if it was there are so many perspectives on the web that you at least need to be thinking about the potential for misunderstanding. You need to try to head off trivial or otherwise unproductive avenues of debate. These are all responsibilities of conscientious communicators. And if you find yourself using a lot of vague language, it&#x27;s probably better not to say anything. Any other policy is willfully contributing to the proliferation of BS on the web.<p>Reality is messy so sometimes you have to use imprecise language to describe it. In that case, it may be helpful to try to precisely specify how imprecise you mean to be, or use some other more specific phrase than &quot;sometimes X&quot; or &quot;sort of Y&quot;. If it needs to be said, you can usually find a way to add more information.",1413057967

A few weeks ago I was dealing poor performance on my cable modem. When I pinged a valid IP, I was seeing the successful packets only. It didn&#x27;t show time-out packets until the summary displayed on exit. This makes it useless for quick real-time monitoring.

The important thing to remember about congestion is at maximum capacity new trips simply increase wait times so a 30 min trip can add more than 30 minutes of wait time spread among all drivers.  And removing a 30 minute trip can save people more than 30 minutes of wait time.<p>Granted as delays reduce people my decide to simply take more trips, but a combination of a car congestion tax, free public transit, and walk-able / bike-able city&#x27;s are far more efficient say trying to stack highways.",1413057718

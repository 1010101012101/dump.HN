So I used a vague, hand-wavy term because I have a vague, hand-wavy understanding of it all. Therefore, I cannot clarify.<p><i>As for &quot;being crapped on and disrespected&quot;, well, if you&#x27;ve spent enough time with him, you&#x27;ll understand why that was a common reaction, he&#x27;s ... a difficult person</i><p>Yeah, I get called &quot;difficult&quot; all the time. I have a life threatening, incurable medical condition. I am pretty laid back, inclined to <i>go along, to get along</i>, and a conflict avoider. But, unfortunately, in order to be socially acceptable, I would need to politely die a slow gruesome death. Failing to go along with that plan for me has caused me shitloads of social problems.<p>Thus, I am inclined to be sympathetic to rms. Many of his predictions have come true. There is no telling how much more problematic things would be had he not stuck to his guns.<p>&quot;Difficult&quot; sometimes just means you aren&#x27;t going along with social norms. If you firmly believe those social norms to be a very serious problem, it is foolish to go along with them. In my experience, no matter how politely you decline to go along with them, and no matter how compelling your reasons for politely declining, simply declining will get you a fuck ton of backwash.",1445723989

Usual scheme is 1% or so of assessed value, which is typically recalculated yearly. Some states have &quot;homestead&quot; exemptions where the first, say, $150,000 of value on a primary residence is exempt from tax. There are also (at least in California) special assessments for a fire or water district that are put on top of the yearly property tax, usually because of state laws that limit the rate at which assessed value can be increased or super-majority provisions for altering property tax rates, and so on.",1445723946

So many / most homeowners did see their tax bills fall. (Exception would be in states like California which have Prop 13-like freezes on the ability of the state to increase the assessed value from year to year.)<p>The foreclosure problem was cause by values dropping and hence Loan-to-Value ratios going above 80%, which is about the highest it can go for a refinance loan.

Could we not <i>perhaps</i> attribute the rating of male candidates higher (or females lower) due to perceived &quot;corrective&quot; bias in a field? One common theme among individuals that are against affirmative-action-type processes, is that the candidates are picked not on merit but rather by quota.

Because we were roommates when he founded the latter, and he most assuredly wan&#x27;t homeless then.  His willingness to be &quot;homeless&quot; later might in part be an artifact of a couple of kids playing with matches and kerosene burning that building down (in a not so good part of Cambridge, MA) and his losing his worldly possessions.  Not that he was, to my observation, very materialistic.<p>As for &quot;<i>being crapped on and disrespected</i>&quot;, well, if you&#x27;ve spent enough time with him, you&#x27;ll understand why that was a common reaction, he&#x27;s ... a difficult person, and is proud of ignoring a number of social norms, including ones that tend to keep a person and their friends alive.<p>But a lot of it after the GNU/FSF started was due to his extreme abrasiveness towards many people who didn&#x27;t entirely buy into his mission.  We were, for example, called &quot;Software Hoarders&quot; (this, while working for for Unipress, the legal licensee of the version of Emacs he stole to start Gnu Emacs, and we ran on a &quot;gated open source&quot; model, if the licencor of a piece of software agreed, you got a copy of the source, you just couldn&#x27;t distribute it, but you could share patches with other customers).

Only courts can declare fair use with authority; an artist claiming fair use for their work has no authority, in the sense that they can still get sued, and neither do their lawers hold defining authority about this aspect. This, effectively, creates a large legal gray zone. eevee is arguing from the perspective of a creator, and people seem to get a little worked up with elaborate, imaginary examples. The important part, though, is the idea behind the post, that being: Artists are subject to a lot of legal insecurity. Copyright is one of the most empowering and simulatanously most crippling insecurities. Remixes and DJ-sets on youtube and soundcloud, publishing street photography, creating fan art, as some examples. All of these are to a varying degree both legal and illegal, most importantly depending on your specific location. In my case, my country knows a case similar to fair use: if said bottle label was reproduced in a recognizable manner, and it was a major part of the work, it would be an infrigement. If it was a minor part (dubbed &#x27;padding&#x27;) of the art work, it&#x27;s considered a sibling of US fair use. But only courts can decide either. And artists often aren&#x27;t well-funded, hence avoid anything which might smell like a lawsuit, hence freedom of expression is hindered in a significant way, for no particular reason but lack of legal clarity. I&#x27;m just writing all this, because you seemed very emphatic in your view. But this is a really ambigious topic, which requires a lot of consideration and empathy on all sides. So I wanted to add a little perspective. /edit: not you, swhipple, but hn seemed very emphatic, while you, swhipple, seemed to recognize a need for clarity, so I wanted to add some perspective under your considerate opionion. Pardon my misaccredition. I didn&#x27;t mean to sound rude or devalue your view as inconsiderate. Your &quot;It isn&#x27;t entirely binary. I support expanding fair use in ways that benefit the public while not hindering artists.&quot; made me chime in.",1445721475

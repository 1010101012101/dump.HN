This might look something like a git commit tree, with branches indicating when you opened a new tab from a link, along with other information and ""tags"" along the way. (One important aspect of this is that just like a VCS, you wouldn't lose your history stack when you hit back a few times and then click on another link within that same tab.) Theoretically, this could even store page states that normally aren't stored in a browser's history, e.g. filling form fields, scroll position, and so on. You could then view your bookmarks, tags, etc in that same interface, with a robust system for filtering and searching of course. Something like this could revolutionize the way I save and recall things online. Plus, I think it'd be pretty cool to be able to see your entire browsing history visualized like that.",1351565279

Apple's culture is generally pretty tolerant of mistakes as long as people fix them quickly. I think in this instance, the problem was that 1) He didn't publicly accept responsibility for the problem. and 2) He couldn't fix the problems fast enough.<p>I know that right after the maps issues came to light, I suddenly got a bunch of recruiting emails from the Apple mapping team. Sounds like the team was caught flat-footed and didn't really have a solid plan to immediately fix things. When you have a pressing and urgent systems engineering problem, I definitely think it's a bad idea to suddenly distract your team with tons of recruiting interviews.

I wonder how they plan to address these issues:<p>1. Only a single level of hierarchy. There's a ""pile"" for ""school work"", but what about having sub-piles for each course that I'm taking? I don't want bookmarks for my CS course getting mixed up with bookmarks for my political science course.<p>2. Can I toss the same bookmark in more than one pile at the same time? The neat thing about tagging is that tags are many-to-many. The concept of piles seems to be a reversion to folders. Don't get me wrong, folders are cool, too. But they have the annoying limitation of being one-to-many.<p>3. Relying on screenshots and/or favicons instead of page titles to represent each bookmark would quickly get confusing when you bookmark multiple pages from the same website. Can you tell one NYT article from another from 120px thumbnails of each page? (Hopefully, those buttons in the top right are for toggling between icon and list view.)<p>4. What if I have 10,000 bookmarks? Is your idea highly scalable (pardon the buzzword), or is it optimized for ~200 bookmarks?<p>All of these nitpicks stem from the fact that a bookmark manager should not only help you save pages for later, but also help you <i>manage</i> the pages that you've saved. Here's the question: Does your product facilitate saving and organizing methods that allow the user to retrieve any page within 5 seconds, 5 years later? Because I do occasionally revisit pages after a decade or even more, after I've accumulated thousands of other bookmarks ranging from ""read this afternoon"" to ""potentially useful to a future project"".",1351563990

You don't really know the first thing about anything unless you did it At Google. It's an extreme case of institutional arrogance.<p>This explains the blind allocation policy. If knowledge that is not At Google doesn't count, then there's no point in matching people with their expertise or interests, because a Noogler by definition doesn't know <i>anything</i>.<p>In July 2011, I did some research on the strategy of the Google+ Games team and saw that the going plan was doomed to failure and seriously risked such embarrassment as to kill the entire product. (Lots of Zyngarbage, preferential treatment to mainstream publishers.) I had some domain expertise from designing a game and spending a lot of time hanging around game designers. So it was pretty easy for me to come up with a strategy that had a damn good chance of actually succeeding. I posted it internally and got a huge amount of engineer support. The strategy was to establish a quality-centered community first by providing a platform for independent developers, integrate it with Hangouts, and become a center for the ""German-style"" board game sphere. The high quality starting community would establish G+ Games as cognitively upscale, creating a comparative brand advantage that would persist in perpetuity.<p>By the way, the Google+ Games engineers also got wind of what I'd been proposing and they supported me. It was as obvious as it can be to humans (obviously, no one can predict the future) that this strategy would work. I got a ridiculous number of emails from engineers telling me that I was right on and that they wished they were implementing ""Real Games"" instead of giving ridiculous preferential treatment to mainstream publishers (who were throwing us mediocre product because they didn't expect us to succeed). What got me in trouble was that a lot of high-level people didn't like that an FNG had so much engineer support.<p>I was a recognized domain expert, but not an At Google domain expert. There were no At Google games experts, because Google had never gone into the Games space before (and that's smart, because Google did extremely well on web search by being ideologically non-editorial, but for the games space <i>quality</i> is so damn important that you <i>must</i> be editorial.) So it came down to politics, because Google's At-Google bias rendered it incapable of recognizing domain expertise and discovering a correct decision.<p>Finally I got an email to the effect of, ""domain expertise isn't relevant here, deal with it. Besides, you're only a SWE 3."" Well, fuck you very much. I don't see why job titles matter when you're about to lose millions of dollars and would have been <i>making</i> as much had you listened to me.<p>A year later, I was proven right, but it doesn't matter in the least. Google+ Games is a non-concern, and I'm not a part of Google.<p>The lesson I learned from that ordeal is not to try to ""save"" a company from itself because you can't. You'll be seen as right, and possibly even lionized, long after you leave... but it won't matter in the least. Keep your head down, stay employed, and enjoy the middle-row seat to the show-- that ""show"" being the people in charge making fools of themselves.",1351563879

That puts him at odds with Cook (the CEO), and Ive (who wants to drive Apple's design decisions).<p>2) He's divisive. There's claims that neither Jonny Ive nor Bob Mansfield would talk to him without Tim Cook mediating. There's also claims that he ""managed up"" (showed off to the boss) better than he ""managed down"", and stole credit while deflecting critisism.<p>3) He was the guy in charge of Siri and Maps.<p>4) He was probably the one driving the post-Jobs war with Google.<p>Siri and Maps are Apple's way of fighting Google. Siri competes with Google Search, and Maps competes with Google Maps. There are reasons why Apple wants to spite Google, but the whole strategy could also be Scot Forstall's way of creating his own empire in Apple. Going head to head with Google requires lots of resources, which would all be under Forstall's command.<p>I don't think it's a good gamble for Apple. Google doesn't really hate Apple. I bet they'll port everything they can to iOS, as long as they can keep pushing their ads. Nexus might see Apple as a competitor, but Nexus isn't worth as much as adwords. As Eric Schmidt said in an interview - ""It's their call"".<p>If Apple goes down the path Forstall wants, they'll be going head to head with Google in the things Google is best at. If they stop trying to turn into a data / AI company, they can focus on what they do best - making easy to use devices which sell like hotcakes, and command a fat profit margin.<p>Android will hurt them, but as long as they focus on their core strengths (hardware, marketing, industrial design, interface design, and integration) they'll continue to do pretty well. They milked the iPod for a decade, despite there being plenty of better value competitors. They can do the same with the iPhone. They can do the same with whatever the next big thing is. I'd say going to war with Google will be at best a waste of time, and most likely a string of humiliating losses.",1351563784

Thankfully I'm in a position where I get/have to do basically everything, so I'm getting very broad experience.<p>There are specific areas where I want to focus -- search, data analysis, infrastructure -- and my next job I'll probably be looking for a focus in one or more of those areas (each of which Google would be a good option but without a degree and at my age I doubt I'd get hired). Be that as it may, I really, really don't want to work in a huge organization. I hate bureaucracy, central authority, people I never see in the organization making policy for me, etc. I spent my entire adult life in the military up til a couple years ago. I think that has something to do with it.<p>edit: This comment really crystallizes the type of thing I want to avoid, which means eschewing employment at Google, IBM, Microsoft,etc:  <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4713802"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4713802</a><p>>Those were (are?) the designations for certain types of jobs over there. You might think that if you're hired into the company, your possibilities are wide open, but they aren't. System administrator flavored SREs (site reliability engineers) could only get other SA-flavored jobs, of which there are relatively few. Meanwhile, software engineer (SWE) type SREs could go into any other SWE job, of which there are many.\nIf you were hired on as a SA-SRE as I was, then you have to do an internal interview to get to be a SWE-SRE. If you can't make it through that, you're stuck. I made it, and a friend did too, but I know people who didn't. I'm sure that makes them feel great, especially if they're already doing SWE type work in their daily jobs.\nI was told repeatedly there was no difference between the types, but found out the hard way when it was time to transfer from a toxic situation and there were few alternatives. It took over a year to finally get it all sorted out.",1351563012

Maybe you could skirt this one patent by packaging data and script code in separate connections and by getting very lucky in a Markman hearing where a federal judge might allow you to shade claim construction language in your favor. That would require you to invest about $1 million minimum testing whether you could get a jury to buy it, of course, so I hope a million is just pocket change to you.<p>Even then, there are hundreds of other patents on the process of downloading Json/XML and parsing data or executable scripts out of it.

It no more represents useful metaphors for interfaces than steam engines represent a good way to build cars.</i><p>This is wrong. It's just a cycle that we're going through with design fads.<p>Less than ten years ago everybody was all for ""lickable interfaces"" with 3D buttons, drop shadows and the like. There was even a whole movement of indie developers for the Mac doing skeuomorphic UIs in the wave of Delicious Library, budded by the Mac press ""the Delicious generation"".<p>Now designers are tired of that look and want something more subtle and flat, inspired by the whole Metro thing (and modern Web style plus the whole movement towards minimal design).<p>The same transitions have happened dozens of times in the history of art and design, from ornamental to utilitarian and back again.<p>One is not inherently better than the other: there can be good and bad skeuomorphic UIs. And, no, the Calendar app, with it's faux leather, is not an example of a bad skeuomorphic UI. If it's bad, it's just because of bad UI, period. The leather part is just decoration, i.e the inconsequential part of skeuomorphism, and doesn't affect behavior.<p>For bad skeuomorphism consider any media app that resembles a physical dvd player, or the turning of the pages in iBooks. I.e behavior that impedes use, not just decorative choices.<p>For the same reason, it also has nothing to do with appealing to ""older users"". If anything, skeuomorphism and references to old physical objects is extremely popular with younger people, from ""steam punk"", to hipsters loving vinyl, letter-pressed cards, pocket watches and everything that has ""patina"", to software like Instagram and Hipstamatic, that digitally applies the image distortions and color artifacts of 30 and 50 year old analog cameras and films.<p>Sorry for the long rant, but I take offense in how everybody is throwing words like ""skeuomorphic"" around, like they always knew what the term meant, instead of just having in drilled into their head that ""skeuomorphic == bad"" from tens of me-too online articles this past year.",1351562591

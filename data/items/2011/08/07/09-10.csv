I mean, when I sell co-lo, rather more than half what my customers pay me goes directly to  pay /my/ provider, and yet my revenue is all of what my customer pays me, even though no matter how efficient my operation becomes, more than half of the money only sits in my account momentarily.   This is my understanding of the commonly accepted distinction between revenue and profit.<p>I mean, clearly, groupon is a very high-risk ""swing for the fences"" kind of startup, and ACSOI does seem to be sketchy to the point of being deceptive, but revenue is revenue, and profit is profit.   There's nothing wrong with reporting your actual revenue numbers before taking out your expenses; that's what revenue /is/",1312710919

From the few times I've read Google's blogs, I thought they were quite transparent and open.</i><p>Ummm....  I'm talking from the perspective of hosting the largest networking group of tech founders in Silicon Valley for the last 4 years.  We've held meetups of 150+ people 4 miles away from the Googleplex every month for several years now.<p>How many Google engineers have I talked to at our meetups in the last 12 months?  2 or 3.  I've also talked to a ton of other young startups around the Valley.<p>What I'm saying is based on that experience.  I don't know where you're located, or what your experience is with Google aside from ""the few times I've read Google's blogs"".  Your mileage of course may vary.<p><i>That would make a great tagline for a dystopian Hollywood film.</i><p>Perhaps.  But, I'm also basing this on a number of conversations with quite expensive lawyers in and around Silicon Valley.  The fact of the matter in US corporate law, is that C Corporations have to maximize shareholder value, and act in the best interests of their shareholders.  When a corporation doesn't do that, the directors of that corporation open themselves to being sued for breach of fiduciary duty.<p><i>There is a good reason why Google takes good care of your data and won't sell it to evil governments or corporations: they would go out of business if they did so.</i><p>Or, they could quietly, privately maximize that data by looking up personal data on founders of startups that are being potentially acquired by Google.  They'd be quite silly not to, actually.<p>They could certainly look up for a history of searches coming from a competitor's IP addresses to see what they are planning.<p>They could certainly look up a potential employee's search history, calendar history (to check for other scheduled interviews), email contents, GPS location data from their Android phones when they are screening job candidates.<p>I'm saying this from the perspective of having built an alpha of a search engine for financial news.  And, I know that I was certainly interested in every single search that was referred from an IP address located in Manhattan.  And if a lot of queries came in for a topic that I didn't have much data for in my index, I quickly went out and found sources of information to pad my index with.<p>It's not a criticism of corporate secrecy and capitalism.  It's the essence of capitalism.<p>If Google doesn't use that data for it's own corporate advantage it's stupid.  I've never heard of anyone call Google stupid.  And, that's exactly what I would do if I had access to that kind of data.  Couple that with some tight NDA's and no one would ever know.",1312710641

2856321,comment,2856095,2856214,5,0,tzs,,,"There are also many stories of businesses that did well. It probably depends on the kind of business, and exactly what the deal is. The local NPR station did a story on this a while back, and looked at a couple businesses and how it worked for them.<p>One that was a success was a small auto repair shop. They did a Groupon deal for $30 oil change for $10, so they were only getting $5 out of it which doesn't even cover the oil. They expected to get about 90 customers. They got 2277.<p>After three days of not sleeping and throwing up everything he ate, the owner snapped into action and bought a second car lift, added more staff, and scheduled appointments for all those people (which had people scheduled out for 8 months).<p>Overall, it worked out. The owner told the reporter that before this, he was driving a '93 Ford F150. Now he's got a Mercedes convertible and his wife has a BMW, both paid for. Sales are up $200k over the previous year, and half of the people from the deal have become repeat customers.<p>Compare this to the other business they looked at. This was a cafe that sold crepes and coffee. They were trying to get people to think of them also as a dinner place. They did a Living Social deal that for $40 let you come in six times (no more than once in a given month) for two entrees and a bottle of wine or a drink of your choice.<p>They got 1200 takers.<p>Like the auto repair deal, this one is a loser, depending on the customers buying other things to turn it around. Unfortunately for the cafe, the customers with the deal did not buy other things. They would not buy appetizers or desserts. They would just come in once a month for their six months, get their two entrees and a drink, and that's it. The owner says she lost $100k.",1312710573
2856320,comment,2856152,2856152,4,0,kahawe,,,"Before we go about replacing IMAP which only has two things going against it (old, complex but not broken) how about fixing the SMTP shenanigans first which would actually be more beneficial? SMTP is even older and arguably actually broken and while there are a few usable work-arounds for things like spam and faking senders etc it needs replacing way more than IMAP does. While IMAP surely is not so ""sexy"" in the eyes of the modern geeks, it seems to work just fine... at least good enough so that googlemail decided to offer IMAP access. And while the same could be said about SMTP - it kinda works and I get my mail - it feels like this small little thing that was turned into a mutant spawn from hell with way too many things plugged in and onto it and it just begs to finally be put out of its misery and be replaced with a modern solution.<p>And Exchange and Outlook is one of my personal pet peeves: I have absolutely no idea why people haven't refused using this bloated, locked in and confusing p.o.s. already. I can edit and change attachments in an email I recieved, there are 3 or 4 different key combinations for searching depending on where in the interface I am and on the server side it doesn't get better.",1312710540

In capitalism, they can start businesses. In communism, they join the Party and work up the ranks. The difference is, in capitalism, you theoretically have different people controlling the guns and prisons and courts. In socialism, the ambitious people control the economic production but also everything else.<p>Anyways, this is a tangent from your project. But I think it's less business culture and more human nature.

The market has always worked this way and Groupon is no exception.<p>Recognizing & reporting revenue for software and virtual goods is a -solved problem-.

While Zynga's profitabilty in the future is uncertain, their profitabilty right now is NOT.<p>====================<p>There are two core issues with the Groupon filing:<p>* Their use of ASCOI grossly misrepresented their profitability -right now-.  They may have an innovative business, but the way they handle money isn't that different.  Certainly not different enough for them to invent new ways to report earnings.  Thankfully, the SEC agrees with me here and has asked Groupon to redo some of their funny math.<p>* Their last round of financing almost ENTIRELY went to cashing out previous investors.

Infact it looks like you've just noted down features from current hype and gmail and attached your name to it.<p>Its just using web tech push crap around. You don't offer an improvement of the problem, just a way to implement the standard process using familiar technologies. The problem you are solving is ""I don't like IMAP"" not actal problems with IMAP.<p>Anyway the proposed stack for those interested:<p>-------------------------------<p>- RESTful API over HTTPS.  (HTTPS should not be required but recommended.) - Not sure how to go about HTTP Status codes.  I'm using them below, but this might be considered misuse.  Must consult for verification.<p>- Labels (instead of folders, however, tags can be hierarchal - like how Outlook renders Gmail tags with a / in them)<p>- JSON (Maybe allow JSON & XML, but require JSON)<p>- UTF-8 (Only encoding type allowed - used for EVERYTHING, including API endpoints and API variables  USE UTF-8.  Will create larger messages byte-wise for european and asian languages, but definitely worth it)\n""Stateless"" (Whatever IMAP states are, we don't do this).  We use Session Cookies, and more precisely OAuth as the de-facto standard.<p>- Conversations as Priority - Servers should attempt to indicate conversations, and keep messages grouped together like a forum topic.  This MUST be done server-side.<p>- NO MIME ENCODING.  Mime-Types as headers are very important, but NO MIME ENCODING under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.\nBuilt-in Push - @gabor talks about clients calling an HTTP endpoint that returns as soon as a new message/s arrive.<p>- Full Text Search - SERVER SIDE<p>Addresses use [user]@[domain] syntax.<p>MSAP servers are looked up via an SRV DNS request for _msap._tcp.[domain]<p>Return is in format TTL [class] SRV [priority] [weight] [port] [target]\nexample:\nSRV 0 0 443 msap.koneko-chan.net\nSRV 1 0 80 msap.koneko-chan.net\nThe first is the HTTPS (SSL) endpoint, and the second is the HTTP endpoint.  Lower priority is prefered, with a fallback to higher priority available.<p>We should also recommend having an SMTP endpoint for the sake of graceful degredation.\nExample of ""working"" endpoint: <a href=""http://msap-serv.koneko-chan.net/source-code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msap-serv.koneko-chan.net/source-code</a>",1312708749

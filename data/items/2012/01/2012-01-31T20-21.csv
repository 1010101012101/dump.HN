3535151,comment,3533471,3534469,7,0,tatsuke95,,,"><i>""Most outsourcing projects don't go nearly that well.""</i><p>Do you have a source for this?  I'm a ""business guy"", but I read the hell out of Hacker News.  I hear this a lot, but it hasn't been my experience, whatsoever.<p>Seriously, how is an outsider supposed to read these arguments as anything more than people on the inside trying to justify what they do and the prices they charge?  Read that article again.  It's written for other hackers, not for business people.  He says, ""making an app is hard, here is why"" and lists a bunch of things that, to be frank, I don't care about.  I need the product to meet my specifications for a good price.  Nothing more, nothing less.  And <i>generally</i> in my experience (which, again, is mostly small projects) that is fulfilled through outsourced work.<p>The fact that any mention of outsourcing draws the ire and down votes of this crowd is disappointing.  At the end of the day, like it or not, people like me are also an essential part of this ecosystem.<p>Edit:  after reading through many of the comments, it looks like there are varying degrees of this problem.  I'm not talking about trying to get someone to build an app for my ""big idea"" for $200.",1328043583

3535148,comment,3534263,3534410,9,0,nirvana,,,"45 minutes seems too short to me. I'm guessing its 45 minutes because the candidate goes thru a series of interviews.  I think this is a mistake as well-- the third time explaining the same thing about his past experience, the candidate has a lot of trouble remembering what he's already told you, vs the guy he saw less than an hour ago.<p>I think a much better method would be to have 3 interviewers maximum, though fewer is better, have them spend an extended period of time with the candidate (preferably all at once, not in series) and to develop a rapport with the candidate.<p>Sure, interviews are intimidating, and if you're having trouble getting them to open up, introducing a programming question isn't going to make it easier.  A programming question with a time limit, to boot.<p>I've been asked a lot of programming questions in my career, and back when I worked for other people, I'd generally go on 5 interviews and get four offers and a callback.  Figure 20-40 programming questions every job hunt.<p>When I didn't get an offer, or it was clear that the interviewer was not satisfied, it was nearly always because the interviewer did an incompetent job.  Maybe %5 of the time the question just stumped me.  But I've seen a lot of people with really heavy accents who get visibly upset when you ask them to repeat what they said, and when they do repeat it they use exactly the same words and don't try to explain it in a different way.  Often interviewers leave out key concepts or requirements when presenting the question because they've presented it so many times they forget.  I've had interviewers explain it wrong, and many times I've had to correct the interviewer because I recognized the question they were actually asking.<p>Now I wonder, how many of these people who fail, or ""don't know what a for loop is"" are really failing, or not just reflecting poor interviewing skills on the part of the person asking the question?<p>Its really easy to have a high failure rate when you leave out a key requirement.  (and then what's the candidate going to say ""you never said that""?)<p>I've met a lot of interviewers that really weren't competent themselves.  I tend to ask them questions (though I never got cheeky enough to demand that they program for me as well) and a surprisingly high percentage of them are trained coders who know one particular area, and seem prone to judge  candidates by their knowledge in that area.  I didn't get a job once because I was asked about assembly language and explained that I'd only had experience with 6502, Z80 and 8080, which the interviewer thought was the same as 8088 and therefore I should be able to write code in the modern intel instruction set, in assembly.   This was for a company doing a social voice web app widget!<p>And don't get me started on interviewers asking me to write code but who won't shut up long enough for me to finish a complete thought in my head.<p>If you get someone to write fizz buzz for you, and your company is developing software more complicated than fizz buzz, then you haven't really learned anything from it.<p>If they ""can't"" write fizz buzz, how did they get in the room with you in the first place?   Think they spent the last several years writing software but somehow lost the ability when placed on the spot in an interview?  (I'm not being sarcastic, I genuinely am curious about this.)<p>I think there's a lot of people with a machismo complex, certainly I've been the subject of them, who are up for the same position, or wanted it, or think that nobody measures up to them, or just delight in seeing failure, or have such a narrow view of things that if you can't write assembly in a win32 environment, you're no good writing web apps either.",1328043481

I started with Rails years and years ago (can't even remember when).  I moved to Merb when Merb was the new hotness because I preferred it's modular approach.  After Merb was ""merged"" (i.e. a few of its philosophies were put into Rails and Merb died due to lack of development), I caught on to Padrino and was impressed by it for the same reasons I was impressed by Merb.  I program in Rails for a living but use Padrino for my personal projects.<p>I actually think a potential knock against Padrino is that it's not quite as easy to get into as Rails.  When I got into Rails, it was all ""create a blog in five minutes"" which is what attracted me to it.  There was a point where I didn't even understand the distinction between Ruby/Rails -- it was just one big scripting language to my PHP-addled mind.  I think Padrino (or even just plain Sinatra) has a slightly steeper learning curve; but it's hard for me to comment on that necessarily because I am no longer a beginner and my perspective is a lot different.",1328043302

That people within America still have the right to freely express themselves is, I think, a less interesting takeaway from this snafu.<p>More interesting is that this sort of behavior is emblematic of major government failure: a failure of policy, of implementation, and of accountability.<p>From a policy standpoint, we've had roughly 24 terrorists or 3 trips attempt to cause harm to US aircraft in the last decade.  In that time, we've hand hundreds of millions of air travelers or millions of trips.  And yet, our policy is to treat every single traveler as a potential terrorist.<p>We've implemented these policies poorly as well.  We've spent billions of dollars on what amounts to security theater.  We've deputized some of the least capable members of our society, giving them the power to screw with customers more or less without reprisal.  We've made travel, which many people viewed with joy a short time ago, a massive pain in the ass.  But apart from that, we've also given untold agencies untold power to surveil, apparently, the entire world.<p>Eventually, and this didn't take long, those in charge of the theater begin to believe they were on the righteous path.  As long as your behavior can be cloaked in ""security"" or ""doing what's best for the country"", you've essentially got a free pass.  And so, 80 year old women get pulled out of line to have their colostomy bags inspected.  Senators must be randomly patted down.  We get decisions like this.<p>And, that security cloak never gets lifted.  When bad decisions are made, as I would argue was made here, we don't hear ""Ya, we overreacted.  Sorry.""  Instead, they double down.  They cry Security! and spew politicized bullshit, the kind that would make Orwell cringe:<p><i>""it tried to maintain a balance between 'securing our borders while facilitating the high volume of legitimate trade and travel that crosses our borders every day.'""</i><p>The trouble is, many Americans seem to have no problem with this.

3535096,comment,3534263,3534377,8,0,nirvana,,,"I believe those who are natural programmers, or maybe people who are just really good at it, are able to understand by talking to someone (Without asking any trick questions) how good a programmer they would be.  I don't really try to figure out if they can program or not, if they can't they wouldn't have made it to the interview (and I don't do phone screens.) I'm more interested in their attitude, their bandwidth (how bright they are) and their ability to communicate. Secondarily, I look for their willingness to learn and their willingness to think abstractly and come up with innovative or inventive ideas.<p>You can learn all this just by talking about a hobby.<p>I think that people who are trained to be programmers (e.g.: not born programmers who started when they were 12 and might not have even gone to college) don't have the innate ability to recognize this ability in others. Thus they must ask them  trick questions or to program, in order to satisfy for themselves that they're good.<p>This is actually not a test of the candidate, but a revelation of the level of competency of the interviewer.<p>If I wanted to, I could make %50 of the people you send me ""fail"" fizz buzz, just by replicating some of the things I've seen from really bad interviewers.  Speaking in a heavy accent, and when asked for clarification, just repeating the exact same (indecipherable) words, while getting visibly irritated.  Or insisting that they use a language they don't prefer, or failing them for leaving off a semicolon on a line, or for not producing bug free code right off the bat because they were writing on a whiteboard rather than typing at a computer, and the acts are very different.<p>I've interviewed a fairly large number of people, and the vast majority of people who didn't pass the interview did so because programming wasn't what they really wanted to do, or they weren't passionate about it, or they were just unable to communicate well enough to feel like a good fit.<p>I used to ask questions much tougher than fizz buzz and I would sit there and watch them struggle and try to help them thru, and at the end of the day, excellent programmers struggle on those things as well, and programmers with no innate ability often did them great because they'd practiced them.  Why ask someone to find a loop in a singly linked list when they're never going to do that on the job?  You can't ask them to architect a distributed realtime database in an interview, but you can talk to them about it.<p>Further, I think that companies either treat programming as a form of craftsmanship where they're looking for great artisans to build a fine product, or they treat it as a process where they're looking for minimally competent interchangeable coders.  I think it is the latter that tend to ask these questions.<p>And I think the trained programmers aren't aware that there's a higher level, of craftsmanship.<p>Its completely arbitrary, but if you asked me to write fizz buzz, maybe I should conclude that, if you're having people of that level of ability interview candidates, that your company is not operating at the high level of ability that I bring to the table, and thus this interview process is likely more arbitrary than anything, and even if I get the job, its not going to be a place I want to work.  (Back in the day the problems I got were a lot harder than fizz buzz, so I can do fizz buzz on the spot, I know, but I'm <i>not</i> saying that you should be asking harder problems, I'm saying that this kind of quizzing is a bad sign to me.)<p>So, when I hear people say that %50 can't pass fizz buzz, I think it reflects more on them than their candidates.  I've not seen anywhere near that level of incompetence, and I don't think my resume filter is more stringent (its probably looser, because I won't let HR types who don't know how to program filter anyone out, and I read the resumes myself.)<p>If this post is down voted to hell, then you also have an answer as to why I didn't give my theories in my earlier comment.",1328042892

Search CL and local want-ads in affluent suburbs. Eventually you will find 1 owner cars with low miles owned by people with the means to take proper care of them. Ask for the maintenance records, look at the condition of the interior and also look for clues on how the person takes care of other things like their personal appearance AND their home.

Interface Builder will get you most of the way fairly quickly, which is deceptive.<p>Then you start refining to try and match the photoshop mock-up for visual design, and find the built-in UI classes don't handle this. Buttons not supporting labels below an image by default, or multiple buttons next to each other on the navigation bar, or a background that moves with a table view, etc. etc. [1]<p>You get to work on custom subclasses (or adapting some open source ones). Interface Builder doesn't let you set properties of custom views, so your view controller starts being filled up with all sorts of stuff that really should be in the nib file.<p>Then you find out that actually, various labels and text views need to support multiple lines of text. This messes up your beautiful layout from IB. Struts & Springs are now useless for half your screen elements, and you put custom layouting code in a custom container view's <i>layoutSubviews</i> method or your view controller just to push stuff down the screen and resize your scroll view's <i>contentSize</i>. The complexity of this layout code grows for every supported orientation and device type.<p>Your NIB files are now a mere shadow of their existance at the beginning of the project, so at this point, making a change to move some views to a different screen (is that only on iPhone/iTouch or iPad too?) is no longer a trivial exercise at all.<p>Yes, it's all manageable.

If you trade a car in of $20,000 trade in value you are saving sales tax in a state that charges that. So in NJ for example by trading the car to the dealer you save 7% of 20,000 or $1400 right there. Now of course you can also do what is known as a courtesy trade running the paperwork through the dealer <i>if</i> you have a buyer all lined up ready to go. That's not easy to do though.

On iOS, it's a UITableView.<p>So, let's say late in the game you're asked to sort contacts by first name, and put a little section indicator in for each letter.<p>On the web that's easy, sort the array, then as you're iterating over it and rendering, insert your section header when the first letter changes. If the list changes, ajax the changes in and use an id on each item to update. Done.<p>On iOS, first you'll need to set up a collation on your table view. Decompose your array of contacts into section arrays. For efficiency, you'll probably want to keep a pointer to that list. Change your section and row count delegates so they match the new structure. Now when you're rendering the cells, you'll need to locate the contact by section and row, and if a cell is tapped you'll need to change that too. If you support editing (delete, etc), there are several other places where you'll need to make similar changes. Speaking of which, what if the user deletes the last contact in a section? You can't delete the last row in a section without deleting the section as well, so you'll need to detect that and react appropriately. Can updates arrive while the list is displayed? You could just reload the whole list, but that will probably result in an annoying UI pause. Better to just update the cells that need to change, so you'll want to find each changed row in your collated lists and update it, being sure to watch for any sections you need to insert/delete...<p>...And on and on.

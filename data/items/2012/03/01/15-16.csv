You follow the 20%/80% rule, prefer to re-use then to program and seemlessly switch from big picture to implementation details.<p>We answers questions like: ""If everybody switched to electric cars, how many solar plants have to be built?"". It is used by governments, companies, teachers to evaluate strategies dealing with events like peak oil, diminishing gas reserves and new technologies.<p>Quintel develops the ETM and is a charming Dutch (grown up) startup, with a central office in the center of Amsterdam. Our engineering-driven team (91% engineers, PhDs etc) get the work done during office hours, so that we can enjoy our evenings, sometimes together with afterwork-beers. The atmosphere goes from professional consultancy to monkey house in no time.<p>Our codebase has something for everyone. 30% plain Ruby, 30% Javascript, 30% Rails and 10% other code. We have good code, bad code, tested code, untested code. We have DSLs (for our non-programmers), API, fast ec2 instances for calculations. Things we did before: Git as a database, custom query language to extract data from the model, massive processing within a rails request (think thousands of ruby objects calculating energy flows). Visualizations with Raphael.<p>You are an experienced developer, you think lean and solve problems creatively. You're proactive, fix first, complain later. You live in (ordered by preference): Netherlands, Europe, World. You'll work the first months onsite, thereafter you may go abroad and work remote (again). Current dev team has an international background: Italian, British, Dutch, Swiss, US.<p>Reactions to: dennis@quintel.com",1330617531

The monopoly is legal, it was even expanded by congress thanks to his lobbying efforts, and the government actually spends taxpayer money to enforce it. And I'm not stealing from the Amish, I just found a more efficient way to distribute copies of his products, copies made at my own cost. And users find my service not only cheaper, but much more convenient: it is not riddled by silly restrictions, and I have a much larger selection. Somehow I make tons of money with it, and all this money would go to the Amish, if he could adapt his business model, because he has a natural advantage to provide the best service: he gets the products first, and with the best quality.<p>Considering that the monopoly is harmful to cultural exchange, freedom of speech and other essential rights, I see moral value in any contributions to bring it down or transform it into something more morally acceptable and less expensive for society.",1330617231

3652565,comment,3651964,3652202,5,0,haberman,,,"I'm of two minds on this.  One part of me agrees with you 100%; artists shouldn't have to ""compete"" with illegal trafficking of their own content.  That's not even fair competition, because it didn't cost the file-sharer anything to create the content.  You're trying to ""compete"" with someone who had no up-front expenses.<p>The other part of me thinks that there needs to be some force to counter the insane overreach that copyright holders increasingly take in the digital age.  For example: 10 minutes of previews that can't be skipped on a DVD/Blu-Ray that you legally bought, DRM that makes it uncertain whether you will continue to have access to your legally-purchased content, or arbitrary restrictions on what devices/software you can use to view your own content.  The natural market forces that should work in favor of consumers are greatly diminished by the fact that a single entity has control over every sales channel for a given work.  And the DMCA gives legal teeth to whatever technological measures content producers use to implement these arbitrary restrictions and controls.<p>There are other cases where the government intervenes to restrict this lopsided distribution of power.  For example, ""compulsory licensing"" requires copyright or patent owners to grant licenses for certain uses of a work at predetermined rates that are set by the government.  For example, this allows musicians to record ""covers"" of existing songs without having to get permission from the original song's author (though a royalty has to be paid).",1330617205

So I haven't needed to go outside Python's stdlib (which mirrors a POSIX libc), even though I don't hesitate to do so.<p>In other projects I've used clock_monotonic (POSIX, but needs a Python module or ctypes until the next Python 3 release), and either dateutil (if I need to do more advanced calendar math) or pytz (if I just need a timezone database).",1330616229

I'm working on a modest-sized (~3kloc) Javascript codebase at the moment and it's somewhat of a mess, but that's really more due to the combined influence of legacy code, time constraints, technical debt, rapidly shifting requirements, and a lack of testing.

So it's very hard to say whether Rails programmers in general are good or bad.<p>I can tell you, however, that it's quite common for Rails programmers to not know much about Ruby except for the parts used by Rails.  In the U.S., Ruby was popularized by Rails, and very few programmers learned the language separate from Rails.  I'm unusual in that I picked up Ruby first (while visiting Japan) and learned Rails much later.<p>Rails is much more than a DSL - I would call it a framework, which includes several DSLs as sub-components - but for a pretty broad range of the complexity of your web application, you spend more time and code dealing with Rails library functions and DSLs than with 'pure' Ruby.  In most cases, that's the point - Rails is useful precisely because it gives you library functions, DSLs, and middleware components that deal with common web app issues.  Rails is a good framework precisely because you can use the framework instead of building things from scratch in pure Ruby.<p>Because of those factors, many Rails programmers don't know the underlying language of Ruby or understand it very well, and I think it's accurate to say that a common mistake made by Rails programmers is to misapply Rails-style conventions in other projects.<p>Rails programmers do have a reputation, in some places, of not being good programmers.  (Whether the reputation is entirely accurate is another issue.)  I think the most common specific complaint I've heard is that Rails devs don't know SQL because ActiveRecord does it for them.",1330614979

Create one such piece consisting of the sqrt(n) largest elements of the combined list and move this piece to the left-most position (call this the buffer piece), while the remaining pieces are simply formed from the remaining elements. Note that the remaining pieces will retain their ordering from the fact that A and B were originally sorted (as long as care is taken not to cross the boundary of A/B), while the left-most piece need not be sorted at this point. Stable? [I didn't see it in the paper, but I think it's necessary] sort the sqrt(n)-1 non-leftmost pieces in non-decreasing order by their tail element. Finally, merge (details left out as to when to stop the merge) the longest sequence of pieces constructable from the beginning of the un-merged list so that the tail element of any piece is not greater than the head element of it's downstream piece with this sequence's downstream piece, using the left-most piece as the buffer and swapping the min element of the two lists into the min buffer position instead of overwriting the buffer element. After a merge, the buffer piece will remain as a single piece and may be re-used as the buffer for the next merge. In the end, simply sort the buffer piece. Notice that we may use an O(n^2) sort for the two sorts that we need to perform without breaking the merge's linear time property since in both cases we're sorting sqrt(n) items.<p>The min element of the remaining pieces will always make its way into the min buffer position a sorted lists' pieces will not be re-ordered by the tail-element sort.<p>Anyhow, many details left off, but you asked for a gist and I believe that this qualifies as a gist.",1330614487

The only choices for map editing are JOSM and Potlatch and neither of those are very user friendly.<p>Just now, I tried correcting a missing street near me, spent about a half hour playing around with the tools, and gave up.  As OpenStreetMap gains popularity, I hope some of these companies using the data will devote some programmer resources to improving things so that ""regular people"" can contribute too.",1330614130

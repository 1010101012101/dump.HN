Am I going to suddenly start a wind farm company just because Obama will invest money into them? Its not like the small time entrepreneurs have a lot of hope getting government contracts. Most of that money will go to the established players in those industries who can afford to pay lobbyists",1226264232

I've never had a problem getting ""mandatory"" requirements waived.<p>If you don't manage to waive the classes, but are indeed hot shit, you should be able to crank out a semester's work in a day or two sometime early on.  Professor might be more impressed/willing to waive when you turn in every problem, solved, on day one.",1226263683

Even better if you have a business education background, chill out, enjoy the networking.<p>Starting a company on the other hand is a grind, ups and down everyday.<p>My MBA gave me the business confidence that I knew pretty much everything that is teachable in business.  However, be aware, only 20% or so of business is teachable, much is not yet understood, or dangerously subjective to be applicable to a particular situation.",1226263587
358485,comment,358256,358378,0,0,dpatru,,,"You're right about the economic value. I think that the best way to make someone feel valuable is to pay him for his services. A donation made out of pity does not evoke the same feeling of self-respect and usefulness in the recipient. It is also preferable that the payment should be made freely. I think affirmative action is debasing in this sense. If a black-old-female-gay-or-otherwise-disadvantaged person for instance suspects that the only reason he has his job is because the law required his employer to fill a quota, he won't feel as valuable as when he knows that his employer was under no coercion to hire him, but hired him simply because the employer thought him worth it.<p>So I think ""feeling"" captures the idea of economic value, and it captures the idea of an individual's happiness which is also important when discussing public policy.<p>Economic law always functions of course. Even under an affirmative-action quota system, a person is only hired if it makes economic sense as a whole to the employer. However, the employee may not feel as valuable.<p>With respect to topic, I think much of the angst felt by adolescents comes from them feeling not useful. Allowing them to be useful, i.e., to get a job and support themselves, would help them feel useful.",1226263530

Parents are unwilling to put their kids in schools will they will get harassed and bullied by lower class kids.  ""Public schooling"" results in private communities.  It used to be that the richest people in a city would live blocks away from the poor and the working class.

One huge difference between adults and non-adults is adults tend to grab every opportunity to improve their skills, and understand that those don't come that often.<p>This article started with an interesting (if incendiary) premise, but then the author showed that he has poor logical skills. Perhaps he should go back to school himself.<p>In short, this article is a hodge-podge of potentially interesting half-ideas and downright nefarious illogical conclusions.",1226263274

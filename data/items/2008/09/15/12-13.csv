The extra help I got in school helped me mostly with the mechanics of writing, spelling and grammar rather than thinking issues. But, that was what I needed.<p>I think maybe she should be complaining more about her son's teacher's attitude than some emphasis on writing at school.",1221483550

Since when do opinions have correct answers?<p>I would love to see great things from Stack Overflow, but I would be surprised if it turns out to provide better answers than can be found by googling and reading mailing list archives -- or at least better answers that are consistently marked as such (or not marked at all, depending on the situation). Introducing voting doesn't magically mean the ""good"" stuff floats to the top.<p>Edit: Oh, and people are already ""trolling for reputation"" as evidenced by a single question having 10 of the same exact answer. I thought this is what voting was going to ""solve?"" <i>sigh</i>",1221483232

No one is saying that we won't allow people to publish posts or blogs as they do today, on any topic they chose. The premise is that we should be able to easily identify credible news. Yes, credibility has subjective aspects but there are objective components as well - and those are the ones we can easily address using the websites you deem so useless. Objective fact checking, citation of sources, transparency - these are things we can and should measure. By merely introducing a 'scorecard' or a 'track record' for a news source, I don't think we've crossed the line to ""global totalitarianism.""<p>I will defend your right to have an opinion, but I think you will find I am not alone in thinking that it is you, Duncan, who may have lost the plot.""",1221481568

304542,comment,304395,304395,0,0,pierrefar,,,"Being in beta can mean so many things. One good way to use it is define a stage where you're looking for testers prior to launch. Some set ups need to be tested by a number of testers larger than ""a handful of friends"". They will suggest usability improvements, suggest features, spot typos, break things you didn't think could be broken, etc.<p>Not to mention that if you impress your beta testers, you'll have them acting like your marketing force at launch.<p>In the end, a well-run beta can do wonders to the quality of the launched software. So please don't go poo-pooing beta testing. Yes it's an abused term but it's still a good thing for those that know how to do it.",1221481104

Most corporations have a ""One share, one vote"" policy, so people tend to have a long tenure if they're good at what they do.

It can be pretty scary/frustrating being essentially paralysed even when you think you know what's going on.<p>I think that sometimes in dreams you can transition from your 'dream' limbs (which you can control in the dream) to your real limbs (which you can't) which could explain a sudden inability to move in dreams.",1249725410

I think most of these urls were found by people that have the google toolbar installed looking at their own private cameras.<p>There are downsides to the toolbar, one of them is that google knows about urls that are never linked.",1249725300

Many have never been on the grid (they're islands with 10-100 people living on them) and they've previously relied on mucky diesel generators and such like.<p>Now, solar panels, wind turbines and hydroelectric are being installed to give these communities a stable energy supply.<p><a href=""http://islandsgoinggreen.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://islandsgoinggreen.org/</a>",1249724389

once in college, before i knew what this was,  i explained the symptoms to a professor who just lectured about REM sleep.  He had no idea what I was talking about and it made me feel like a crazy person.  But a few years later more information has appeared on the internet and I've identified it as sleep paralysis.<p>I haven't been able to put it into a pattern yet, though it's happened when I'm sober, semi-drunk (but never when I'm passed out), and when I fall asleep in a car--not driving, of course, though it's accompanied by a dream that I'm driving and am unable to move--talk about scary.",1249724291
749136,comment,748919,748919,0,0,lionhearted,,,"So the article goes on with some interesting facts and data, and then the ""Opinion Editorial"" part comes in. The author's opinion? The birthrates are low because there's not enough social services!<p>> But underlying all this may well be the cost of children for families with high housing costs that need to save for health care and retirement because of limited government programs.<p>Ah, well, thankfully this would be easy to check. All you'd have to do is look at fertility rates by country. If it was true, then you'd see that the countries with the lowest fertility rates had the lowest taxes and spending on social services.<p>And... that information is available. Here we go:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_territories_by_fertility_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_territori...</a><p>Wait a second! The bottom 50 countries in terms of fertility are almost all highly socialized?<p>Meaning that increasing government spending on welfare decreases the incentive to have children to provide and care for you?<p>> More significant are those like the Netherlands, Scandinavian countries, France, New Zealand and to a lesser degree Britain. All are characterized not only by generous welfare and maternal leave provisions, and infant care systems, but also by high levels of sexual equality as measured by incomes and social position.<p>So you'd expect those societies to have fairly high birth rates. So out the 200 or so countries on the planet, you'd expect them not to be, you know, in the lowest 60 countries in terms of fertility rates. Good thing we have data again:<p>Netherlands #155, Sweden #151, Denmark #150, Finland #147, France #137, New Zealand #122, United Kingdom #148<p>Wait, they're all in the lowest 50-60 in terms of global fertility? Well, don't let the facts get in the way of a good argument.<p>I read a paper on this - as social services go up, fertility and birth rates go down. This happens in wealthy countries and poor countries, though wealthy countries also have low birth rates. Controlling for wealth, more social services, welfare, and so on = lower fertility.<p>The paper had a number of theories why - one was that you didn't have to count on your children to provide for you in old age. That meant less pressure to have a large number of children to make sure at least one child became successful and could care for you. Children were the ""pension plan"" before there were pension plans.<p>The article is interesting, the facts in the first half are good quite and spot on and illuminating. The conclusions certainly seem pretty clearly incorrect when looking at the data.<p>Social services can make many claims to fame. Higher birth rates is not one of them - in fact, if you can get over the fearmongering tone, this clip is fascinating. It talks about how the ferility rates in the lower is even lower than reported if you don't include Muslims.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0U5Kw57iv4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0U5Kw57iv4</a><p>The video explains why societies collapse economically without having enough children, then explains that Muslims are going to take over the world. The tone is fear-monger generating, but my good English Muslim friend said he had a laugh at it, so hopefully not too bothersome to Islamic friends here. Salaam.<p>Anyway, article's facts? Interesting. Article's conclusion of more social services will increase birth rates? Data suggests the opposite is true.",1249723729

749125,comment,748826,749066,0,0,larryfreeman,,,"To be clear, my point is that people are flocking to these article-based web sites so there must be something there beyond just being text on the web.<p>The traffic has been growing.  At HubPages, we were at 8 million unique visitors in Nov, 2008 and now we are approaching 14 million unique visitors in Aug, 2009.<p>I would argue that these article-based sites are popular because of the web tools available on them, the community of writers and readers to interact with, and the growing traffic.  People want these types of places to add their information.<p>Sure, they could open a blog account by itself or write anonymously on Wikipedia but it's not the same.<p>Scribd seemed to be the first of these sites to go mainstream.  That was my main point to your question.  If there's nothing there, what accounted for Scribd's popularity?<p>It took me a long time to understand why Twitter was an improvement over RSS.  Sometimes, these trends are not obvious until you have the experience of participating with the web site that is growing in popularity.<p>I hope that better explains my original point.",1249722139

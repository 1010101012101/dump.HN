It is a very dangerous attitude to just dismiss legitimate feedback, hope everything just magically fixes itself and lull yourself in the sense of complacency that ""it will just work out"". Hope is not a strategy.<p>Of course it is inspirational to know that even if you start with a lousy idea you could be able fix it.

If you somehow got access to the root account on the central control computer of a nuclear power plant, could you cause a meltdown? Most likely, the answer is no, because you don't know how to control a nuclear power plant. You can run any command, but you have no idea which command would cause any real-world damage. If you're just doing it for the lulz, you could go for the ever-popular ""rm -rf *"" and cross your fingers, but if you want to be sure to cause damage, you're going to need some domain-specific knowledge. Not just knowledge about nuclear power plants in general, but also knowledge about how to manipulate the control systems at your specific target nuclear power plant.<p>In other words, even if you have an easily-exploited attack vector available to you, you still need to know a lot about your target in order to cause damage. Contrast this to guided missiles, which don't really need to know anything about the building that they are blowing up other than its GPS coordinates.<p>For this reason, I'm skeptical that ""any dumb hacker"" will ever be capable of causing something like a nuclear meltdown via virus infection.",1316926191

A floating city configuring an independent libertarian utopia nation. A billion-dollar indoor ski resort just outside Atlanta. A bridge from Spain to Africa sporting a 5 mile suspended span. A world-class [fill in the blank, how much ya got?] facility annex to a super-mall in ""why would anyone move there"" Syracuse NY. And so on, one project after another with big flashing ""ain't gonna happen"" signs over them.<p>Then I realized. It wasn't success of the project that was the goal, it was keeping a small team of creatives employed in a perpetual state of promotion and study-funding: find someone with deep enough pockets, and they'll shell out a livable fee to be able to say ""hey, look at this..."" to other deep pockets. No way that Atlanta ski resort would happen, but the idea was exciting enough to elicit enough funding for studies to pay the bills (at least until the vital-to-snow-making nearby lake almost dried up) for a few people in modest offices. You can make a nice living promoting stupid ideas.<p>And if the stupid idea actually pans out, takes off, and succeeds, well, the possibility of success is awesome enough to keep trying.",1316925018

There's really no real reason for this, other than to boost social currency by saying ""I was with Person X."" I don't think its really replacing hanging out and doing stuff with people, but its making it so much more real-time, since all of your friends know what you're doing literally as you're doing it.<p>However, one thing that Facebook is good for is coordinating groups. I'm in a class council group as well as groups for a few AP classes. Since everyone is always on Facebook, it makes setting up and coordinating things while getting feedback super easy.

What if there was a service that lets you become more spontaneous?<p>Spontaneous gifts delivery service for your girlfriend/boyfriend/husband/wife<p>A site where people can tell us something about their significant other and maybe tell us some of their preferences such as type of things they prefer, their budget,some important dates (birth date, anniversary date, when they first met)<p>This will help not only those who forgets important dates but also those who want to send some spontaneous gifts to their loved ones without having to do anything. We will automatically send the loved one a gift every once in a while (based on certain preferences of course)<p>What do you guys think? Would you find this type of service useful?",1316924128

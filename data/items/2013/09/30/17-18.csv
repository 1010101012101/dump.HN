Whatever.)<p>And, because this is the internet, I&#x27;ll mention that I am <i>absolutely not</i> suggesting that these things are true of Mr Levinson and Lavabit.

In one job I worked at, replacing someone&#x27;s code with your own that works better made you a hero, and it was incumbent on the other person to have no ego about it. In another job, that was tantamount to insubordination, and not respecting the blood, sweat and tears that had been spent before you got there.

So maybe the user wants to see the list of all users in the Stretchr company. So just from the URL they can determine that a good way to do that is probably by removing the end of the URL so that it is:<p><pre><code>     http://www.stretchr.com/companies/Stretchr/users\n</code></pre>\nAnyway, that&#x27;s just my personal preference, but I think that query string style URL&#x27;s should be avoided unless absolutely necessary and nicer REST style URL&#x27;s should be used instead.<p>If you have a one page app you can route all requests on the domain to one page, and then use Backbone logic to look at the REST style URL and show the correct view based on the URL.",1380563543

You can see the animations defined as real keyframes in CSS, not overly reliant on javascript, which is good. It means there is a chance of taking those and using them independently of the JS runtime code, and also that execution will take advantage of native browser animation functions, rather than being bottlenecked by JS code.<p>It would be nice if there was some options for stripping out the Ad specific javascript.

In real world terms, if the chance of a house burning down in a fire is 1 per year per 1000 homes at an average cost of $200k each to repair (totally bogus numbers), then an insurance company can break even by charging a homeowner $200/year to insure the home against fire.<p>Over a large enough number of homes, that should be reasonably close to the actual amount they have to pay out.

Just like you say, you&#x27;re not investing any resources for the $0 case. However, from a purely rational perspective, it looks like this:\nImagine that the quality of the chocolate is a utility-function. The cheap chocolate doesn&#x27;t taste good, so you only gain 0.1 points of utility on a scale from 0 - 1. The Lind chocolate tastes really great, it makes you smile and happy, it has a utility of 0.3.\nIn this case, if you decide to buy Lind instead of Hershey&#x27;s, you are willing to pay $0.10 more than what&#x27;s necessary in order to gain more utility. The added value of the better chocolate has a worth of $0.10 which you&#x27;re willing to pay.\nIn the free case, the utility is the same, and the price difference is the same, so if you, earlier, were willing to pay an added $0.10 for the added utility, you should still be willing to pay an added $0.10. But of course, when there is a free alternative, people don&#x27;t. \nYou&#x27;re outlining some of the reasons for that, and they all make sense, I&#x27;m just saying that this is standard human behaviour which affects the realities of the app store even though it is not rational. On a Micro Level, human beings are oftentimes not rational at all and this is a good example of that.<p>Btw. there is a limitation in the study: People could only buy the chocolate once, so even if it is free, you could not take 100. So the no-resources point does not totally explain the behaviour either. There does not need to be a logical explanation to this anyway, it may be something that&#x27;s still stuck from the Lizard Brain that&#x27;s causing this.",1380562848

We found Facebook quitters to be significantly more cautious about their privacy, having higher Internet addiction scores, and being more conscientious than Facebook users. The main self-stated reason for committing virtual identity suicide was privacy concerns (48 percent). Although the adequacy of privacy in online communication has been questioned, privacy is still an important issue in online social communications.</i>",1380561643

There are some that become Gordon Ramsay&#x27;s and others that get stuck in a greasy diner at a forgotten highway off-ramp.<p>Cooking professionally can be ugly, filthy, horrible hard work.  There&#x27;s the television version of the rich and famous cook and the reality of the actual work being really hard.  And, yes, you have to do a lot of stuff you don&#x27;t really enjoy doing.  And, yes, it isn&#x27;t all creative and wonderful.<p>Why am I making an analogy to cooking?  Because over the last few years I&#x27;ve ended-up doing a lot of cooking for my family.  I&#x27;ve studied some and really enjoy the creative process.  However, I&#x27;ve also found myself completely and utterly fed-up with it at times.  I used to be the designated cook when we went camping.  The last time we went camping I drove out as far as necessary to go get take-out.<p>So,yes, programming, depending on the choices you make, can be like sausage making.<p>If you are the creative type you need to make an effort to find the right job for you or start your own business.  Still, as someone else pointed out, you are going to have to stomach the idea that you are still going to have to do things that you will not enjoy.  This is true of any job.<p>I always told my employees that I&#x27;d never ask them to do anything I was not willing to do myself (or hadn&#x27;t done before myself).  Examples of that were things like washing the pile of filthy coffee mugs in the kitchen area (&#x27;cause it seems that adults are pretty bad about cleaning after themselves sometimes) or getting in our Haas CNC machine to clean it.  The point wasn&#x27;t that I expected them to actively do these things but to realize that all of us ought to understand that there are things you don&#x27;t enjoy doing that simply need to be done.<p>As a programmer you need to seek out work that really turns you on.  How do you know?  Because you can&#x27;t stop thinking about it and you can&#x27;t stop working on it.  You want to talk about it all the time and you want to learn how to do it better.

However, a suicide normally requires depression or some linked emotional trauma. Without that, the suicide is suspicious. If the suicide is linked to an accidental sexual game then the victim looks like a pervert, is shamed publicly and the &quot;suicide&quot; is much difficult to question. QED, murders through sexual misadventures are much easier to pass off than depressive suicides or straight up murders<p>Or, you know, people do just kill themselves in large numbers in the UK.

In spite of globalisation, we cannot expect their mindset to change a lot after they&#x27;ve fought so badly for jobs, right? This old mindset comes into play when they suggest us to go to college : they&#x27;ve seen decades of public sector employment, this new path (entrepreneurship) seems new, and they honestly believe they are trying to help you. There is no ill-will here.<p>I do agree one can still earn a good living without college in India too. But I feel what I said has a considerable effect in societal status of middle class people (most of whom are not extraordinary), and this in turn makes people want the college degree.",1380561184

And, there are many benefits to being &quot;just a software engineer&quot;. Much of it depends on your attitude towards life and what you&#x27;re expecting and/or hoping to get out of it.<p>First, it&#x27;s important to recognize that as we get older, we&#x27;ll eventually have to confront the fact that not all of our dreams and ambitions will come true. If you look at the number of thought leaders in the industry in ratio to the total number of programmers, very few make it to the top 1%. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a zero-sum thing, it&#x27;s more that at a certain point, people give up and decide to do something else. OP may be one of those people who decides that because reality didn&#x27;t match his expectations, he&#x27;s just going to give up. On the other hand, he could decide to push himself and his understanding of what it means to program to a new level. And then he might see new opportunities in his current job that he hadn&#x27;t noticed before. I know that this can sound hopelessly fanciful and idealistic, but it really is true and quite possible; I speak from my own experience here.<p>Second, one of the most awesome things about programming - regardless of the type you&#x27;re doing - is that it helps improve your mind. Since I&#x27;ve been in the tech industry, I&#x27;ve found that my thinking tends to be cleaner, more rigorous, and more realistic (though not always, of course). I have an easier time understanding difficult topics than I used to and I also find the process of learning easier than in the past. For that reason alone programming is a worthwhile pursuit. Who doesn&#x27;t like their mind to work better?<p>Finally, OP has some growing to do and should try to realize that his current predicament has much to do with his attitude and little to do with his actual job. As other posters have noted, this problem exists in every creative industry. You were excited about the pure fun of it when you were younger, and now you feel mugged by reality as it were. Part of this could relate to our model of education which sometimes makes it seem as if academia is much preferable to actual private industry work. Like they said in Ghostbusters - &quot;they expect results in the private sector!&quot;<p>My advice to OP would be to try and balance his current work responsibilities with something fun outside of work, something that gets his juices flowing. Learning to bring a sense of play into your really helps, otherwise yes...the sense of drudgery can kill you. So the trick is to learn to stay positive. Sounds like a tall order but it&#x27;s definitely doable.",1380561141

6470788,comment,6464127,6469142,13,0,steveklabnik,,,"First of all, I just want to say that I don&#x27;t think that Haskell or Rust are competing with Go, we&#x27;re just talking type systems here. I&#x27;ll use those two because they&#x27;re my favorite. Three examples, one from each and one they share:<p>In Haskell, the type system ensures that side effects only happen in one place: things inside a monad of some kind. For example, if I&#x27;m given a function:<p><pre><code>    foo :: Int -> Int\n</code></pre>\nI _know_ for a fact that this function doesn&#x27;t do any IO. It doesn&#x27;t maintain any state. It won&#x27;t launch the missiles. And I also know that everything needed to understand what goes on in `foo` will happen via the one parameter. Because it&#x27;s annoying to pass around code that interacts with the outside world, you end up with a small shell of imperative, stateful code, and a large amount of stateless, pure functional code. Since Go (to my knowledge) doesn&#x27;t enforce referential transparency, it won&#x27;t do this.<p>Haskell and Rust both don&#x27;t have the concept of null. This is fantastic, as even the inventor of null thinks it&#x27;s a bad idea. It&#x27;s borderline irresponsible to write a new programming language with nulls today. So how do they handle a computation that may fail? Higher order types:<p><pre><code>    use std::option::Option;\n\n    fn call_me_maybe(x: int) -> Option<int> {\n        if(x > 5) {\n            Some(x)\n        } else {\n            None\n        }\n    }\n\n    fn main() {\n        let i = 6;\n        match call_me_maybe(i) {\n            Some(x) => println!(&quot;Yes! {:i}&quot;, x),\n            None    => println!(&quot;nope&quot;),\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis will print &quot;Yes! 6&quot;. If you change it to 5, it will print &quot;nope&quot;. The higher type wraps the output and tell us if we&#x27;ve succeeded or failed. Here&#x27;s the kicker: what happens if we leave off the error case?<p><pre><code>    rust.rs:13:8: 15:9 error: non-exhaustive patterns: None not covered\n    rust.rs:13         match call_me_maybe(i) {\n    rust.rs:14             Some(x) => println!(&quot;Yes! {:i}&quot;, x),\n    rust.rs:15         }\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;ll make us handle it. And since it has a different type, we can&#x27;t pass it to something that takes an `int` either, because it&#x27;s an `Option<int>`. Both Rust and Haskell can do this, and have tools to make this easier, too. For example, maybe you want an error message, so Rust&#x27;s Result type has a message on the fail case. Or you need three or more states, you can build your own.<p>Finally, in Rust, data is immutable by default:<p><pre><code>    let i = 6;\n    i = i + 5;\n\n    rust.rs:3:8: 3:9 error: re-assignment of immutable variable `i`\n    rust.rs:3         i = i + 5;\n                  ^\n    rust.rs:2:12: 2:13 note: prior assignment occurs here\n    rust.rs:2         let i = 6;\n</code></pre>\nAnd pointers have explicitly one owner or many owners:<p><pre><code>    fn main() {\n        let i: ~int = ~6; // read: i is an owned pointer to an int.\n        let j: @int = @6; // read: j is an managed pointer to an int.\n        let k = i;\n        let l = j;\n        println(i.to_str()); // error: use of moved value: `i`\n        println(j.to_str()); // this is fine\n    }\n</code></pre>\nSo in Rust, you cannot share data that has multiple owners across threads:<p><pre><code>    fn main() {\n        let i: ~int = ~6; // read: i is an owned pointer to an int.\n        let j: @int = @6; // read: j is an managed pointer to an int.\n\n        do spawn {\n            println(i.to_str()); // fine, prints\n        }\n        println(i.to_str()); // you can&#x27;t use it after you&#x27;ve given it away, either!\n        // error: use of moved value: `i`\n        // println(i.to_str()); // \n        //        ^\n        //note: `i` moved into closure environment here because it has type `~fn:Send()`, which is non-copyable (perhaps you meant to use clone()?)\n        //do spawn {\n        //    println(i.to_str()); // fine, prints\n        //} \n\n        do spawn {\n            println(j.to_str()); // error: cannot capture variable of\n                                 // type `@int`, which does not fulfill\n                                 // `Send`, in a bounded closure\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nTherefore, race conditions are a compile-time error. Go has a race detector, which can help, but it can&#x27;t always help.<p>Anyway, hopefully that explains some of my beef with Go&#x27;s types. I think Go gets a lot of things right, I think the type system is one place where it gets things really wrong.",1380561019

You might end up being just good enough to make a few bucks at it, pick up some PHP or Ruby on Rails, and drive yourself straight into a dead end.<p>None of this is really programming. Sure there is a bit of going through the motions, but you have all these frameworks supporting you, whether HTML or Rails or whatever, and you fail to get to the heart of the matter.<p>Far better to get a book like SICP (now freely downloadable) install one of the free Scheme packages out there and struggle through writing all of the code for all of the exercises in that book. It will be tought. You will suffer. And at the end you won&#x27;t have much to show for it; i.e. no pretty websites. But you will have trained your mind to think the way programmers need to think. And you will also have learned to persist in the face of disappointment and failure because that is what programming is really all about.<p>Of course, there are more marketable languages like C# and Java and it is definitely worth while to work through exercises from a good book in a similar manner, but you won&#x27;t get as good an education as someone who pushes through SICP. Those of us who learned programming in an imperative language like Java, are now either in a stagnant rut adding features to big balls of mud that hang like chains around the neck of our employer or else we are slowly pushing our way along the path blazed by SICP.<p>If you already know a bit of programming in any language, you could also take Functional Programming in Scala followed by Reactive Programming at Coursera. They run these courses a couple of times a year and they are good. SICP is recommended reading for this course even though the language is completely different. True programming is all about mathematics and using it to solve problems in a simple way. You need to understand functions, sets, boolean logic, lambda calculus, algebra, category theory in order to truly excel. Mathematics is something that you build inside your head and something that you can apply to any programming language or platform.<p>By the way, most CS degrees do not teach this. If you find a school that DOES teach this, then by all means, get the degree if you can afford it. But too many schools leave the real stuff for the Masters and Doctorate level folks. If you self-learn, like I did, then you can do better. But you better be prepared to work real hard because most of the time there is no course to keep you on track.

And I get asked alot about how I did it.<p>For me, it happened in two phases.<p>When I was 14 or some years old, we did not have a computer at home, so the only way I could play with one was to participate in our science fair and work with one. I participated to make a static HTML website that year. I knew nothing about it, so I got a book and learned basic HTML from it and made one. I liked doing that so much so I kept on doing that for 3 years.<p>Then I picked up some Visual Basic, because I could build some &quot;cool&quot; UI components with that.<p>Mind you, till here I hadn&#x27;t taken &quot;official&quot; CS classes.<p>But then I joined college for CS and hated every bit of it, as most of it was out of touch from reality (maybe specific to my university) so I changed my major to Computer Engineering and then learned programming in this &quot;second phase&quot; on my own while developing projects.<p>So far that is the best way I know how to actually learn programming. Try to solve a problem. And ask people if you get stuck on something. You will feel like shit every day for awhile, but that would make you a better programmer and a person.<p>Just learn basic syntax of a programming language. In my second phase I did that with Python (for APIs) and Obj C (for iOS).<p>Just learned the basic syntax and then mostly relied on the developer documentation (please get used to reading those, that is the best way to stay upto date with any changes that happen in the future). Also, stackoverflow. But only use stackoverflow if you cannot figure it out for days. Try working on it on your own first. mostly things have solutions online. try searching.<p>But most importantly, build. Build and solve problems. That is the most rewarding and effective way. It would make you a better problem solver.<p>I hope that helped!",1380560606

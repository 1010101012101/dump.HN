From my experience doing similar things -- not weaponizing exploits, but turning them into polished tools as part of [1] and [2] which I&#x27;d consider roughly equivalent -- I would estimate that productionizing an exploit takes about 3-5 times longer than the time required to find the exploits themselves.<p>Note that there have been proofs-of-concept of this for some time [3], as linked elsewhere in this thread. While it is still impressive that they could link it into their exploit framework, I honestly believe that you could &quot;weaponize&quot; something like the previously linked exploit without a massive effort.<p>Also note that this is not a &quot;complete takeover&quot; of an HDD, but rather an exploit that allows it to interpose between the platter data and the computer.<p>[1] grack.com/romtool<p>[2] unrevoked.com<p>[3] <a href=""http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack&page=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack&page=1</a>",1424663903

Are they getting greater advancement because they are Asian?  Or it is the fact that 1 segment of the population has a larger number entering that space?<p>&quot;Her male bosses told her she&#x27;d built it without permission. Then they said only architects within the company could pitch features — and all the architects were male.&quot;<p>^^ As a white male, I had recently done this in my job and was told the same.  Our protocol as that we are required to request permission prior to developing new features.  This is not uncommon.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s why the industry is so eager to hire women and minorities.

As a white male, I would assume companies would seek the best that they could find, rather than seek to locate a segment of the population that is less inclined to enter the tech space.<p>This is just a poorly written article to draw in readers, and a few instances of people that had bad experiences in their own workplace rather than industry facts.\nWe are have bad experiences in life and work, regardless of our sex, age, race, or religion.

Developers using node.js and io.js can use new syntax as soon as their platform of choice supports it.<p>For browsers, yes, compatibility means we have to transpile. But the day you need not isn&#x27;t necessarily so far-flung. Like you say, browsers largely auto-update and, after a slow start, they are implementing ES6 features at a good pace. The ES6 compatibility table[1] shows the progress already made. Only WebKit is really lagging. IE.next/Spartan is actually leading the pack, and coupled with Microsoft&#x27;s plan to give away Windows 10 free to Windows 7 and 8 users, it gives good hope for the future.<p>Also, transpilation can be a gradual strategy for converting code. The Babel (née 6to5) authors have stated their intention to keep supporting new JS features as they are added to future versions of the EcmaScript standard. I think we&#x27;ll soon see Babel able to be used like Autoprefixer, which selectively adds vendor prefixes to CSS based on browser support statistics and a developer-specified target configuration like &quot;last 2 versions&quot; or &quot;> 5%&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/</a>",1424662267

Sure, it&#x27;s a browser plugin, but it works just as well with Chrome and Safari (and probably Firefox and, <gulp>, IE). Their touch-unlockable iOS app is just icing on the cake. I&#x27;m not getting a dime for this endorsement.

You have to assume that a state-level attacker will be able to either coerce the vendor or its employees into signing malicious firmware or just compromise their network and steal the signing key.<p>The right way to secure firmware updates is with a hardware write-enable switch/jumper that has to be physically set to make any changes to the firmware.",1424660802

Whosoever presides over this, I hope they seek and drill for specifics, and demands comparison with other partners&#x27; specific performance, because on its surface, you can use this as an excuse to fire anyone.

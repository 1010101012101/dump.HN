4903,comment,4902,4902,0,0,jward,,,"I highly recommend pyweek to anybody interested in coding.  It's a one week long competition where you and a team of unlimited size build a game from scratch(mostly) in Python.  To prevent cheating, or at least make it harder, a theme is voted on and announced at the beginning.<p>I'm posting this here because I competitions like this fit well with the ycombinator theme of getting something working out the door quickly.  If you've never actually tried to produce something complex quickly by burning hard give this a shot.  It is very inspirational to be able to look back at the end and see what you've done.  If you're planning on doing a web startup I'd also recommend it as a team building activity.  The stress is high, the time limiting, and the competition hectic.  You'll find out quickly how well you can work with people in a crunch.  And you will learn a lot both about coding and the people you work with.<p>This is the third one that Erik and I will be entering into.  It's a lot of fun and I look forward to seeing some skilled competition coming from here.",1174265325

Although XmlHttpRequest is most convenient, there were other methods of doing this before XmlHttpRequest such as <p>- loading a 1 pixel image and sending data in the image's cookie<p>- loading server data through a tiny frame which contained XML or javascipt data<p>- Using a java applet to fetch the data on behalf of javascript",1174263990

Webkit was based on an open source project (KHTML under the LGPL) and <i>there is</i> a requirement that the code be shared.  Also Apple basically did the same thing as Amazon did here at first:  they just dropped huge tarballs on the developers with no comments.  In fact, attempting to merge Apple's changes in without comments was so divisive that the forks split, and only years later did Apple open up to an extent with WebKit that it became a proper collaborative effort.<p>As for whether or not it's useful in practice ... note that <i>I am</i> one of the authors of one of the things they released, and my first reaction was to run a diff against the original to see if they'd made any interesting changes (they haven't).",1318672238

It's a straightforward solution to offer developers a programmatic way to opt-out.  With maps or news readers, I might want to keep a local copy indefinitely on my iPhone but do I want these constantly backed up? No.  I wouldn't mind re-downloading them when I upgrade my phone.  But do I want them deleted arbitrarily when storage runs low?  No because I have no control over it.  Just imagine your browser cache being cleared by the OS at random moments when other applications trigger an arbitrary file limit and causing errors at random moments.<p>If Apple could offer a way for users to allocate a fixed amount of space for certain apps and opt out of syncing certain data per app, it wouldn't be a problem.<p>What's more this change suddenly happened.

This is the embodiment of the fine line between a short-lived game and one that will stay in history books. Quake, Doom, Duke Nukem 3D had it for me. Starcraft, Super Mario Bros or Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo had it for others. When you enjoy every single second and wish you could do it again the minute after, then you know you have a true immortal game in front of you.<p>One of my prominent design patterns when I try to work on games is to focus on very elementary satisfaction and a promess that doing it once more will still make the player smile. On FPS games for example, a cool and straightforward way to achieve that is to design levels so that they would work in all of single player, cooperative and deathmatch modes. Unfortunately, such good practices were lost in translation when we entered the third millenium and the era of in-game cinematics.",1318671502

I broke the habit by refusing to buy games that didn't fit a very particular set of criteria:<p>They have to be...<p>- single-player,<p>- story-based campaigns<p>- with a target completion time under 30 hours<p>- and a Metacritic score above 85%.<p>This way, I can play 5 to 10 games per calendar year without a dramatic dent on my social or professional lives. I've been doing this for the last 3 years and my annual gameplay time is probably somewhere around 100 hours.<p>Some tricks:<p>Convince yourself that all side quests are for losers without better things to do. That may or may not be true, but it's helpful to avoid spending way too much time on any particular game. Aim for the ending credits & then when you get there, stick the game back in its case and put it on the shelf. Don't leave it in your console.<p>Don't even try the multiplayer versus modes. Just don't do it. Pretend that menu option isn't even there. Those modes are intentionally addicting.<p>And if you really prefer multiplayer, or if you simply can't avoid that attractive menu option... then set an alarm before you start playing. Press snooze when it goes off, finish your round, and then STOP PLAYING.

It even teaches some bad practices and omits crucial detail.<p>The biggest problem I saw was that it introduces classes and objects but does not tell you anything about the ""rule of 3"", destructors, copy constructors and assignment operators. These are crucial to understanding C++'s pass-by-value semantics and writing sensible C++. C++11 adds to this mess by adding rvalue references, move constructors and whatnot. Writing good and safe C++ requires you to use stack based resource management wisely and use ctors/dtors for initialization and cleanup (this is also why you almost never write try/catch in C++ - and there's no finally statement).<p>Another example: the article shows you how to do a Java-like constructor like this:\npoint::point(int x, int y) { this->x = x; this->y = y; }<p>When in C++ you want to use initializer lists like this:\npoint::point(int x, int y) : x(x), y(y) {}<p>At best this tutorial teaches you to write ""C/C++"" (the worlds most popular programming language that does not exist) or ""C with classes"". This style of programming has all the disadvantages of writing C but none of the advantages of C++.<p>C++ is one of the most complicated languages out there, on par with Haskell and Scala. It's C legacy makes it also somewhat dangerous and the pass-by-value semantics make it very different from any other language out there.

I switched jobs, because my current job at the time was moving from building new stuff to maintaining old stuff, and the new job was all about building from the ground up and learning new skills.<p>I loved the new job, but then due to severe fiscal mismanagement multiple rounds of layoffs came about and the remaining people got their salaries cut by 20%.

With a mortgage to pay, I went back to a job with a high salary (and more boring actual work).<p>Without the salary cuts, I would still be at the job. Too bad, I really liked it.

At the suggestion of her teacher, she's gotten into the habit of going to the library and doing her homework there, before she even leaves. There are a few computers in the library to use and there's a teacher around to help answer questions. She does the work there, then brings it home and we check over it. It's a good balance of self-discipline and supervision, I think. In fact, giving her the freedom to initiate the ""doing homework"" on her own rather than having me tell her to do it when she gets home has been good for her. It's nice to see her taking responsibility of her own accord.",1284378675

But Stewart and The Daily Show became America’s sharpest political satirists by aiming at least a little bit higher.<p>Oddly coincidental that if Matt Stone & Trey Parker of South Park fame read this, their response would be ""Thanks for the kick in the nuts."" As per one of their video interview, this is their usual response to when people categorize them into the same bucket as Family Guy by saying something like ""South Park and Family Guy are the only shows I love."" Why does the author feel the need to compare South Park and Daily Show, so as to make Daily Show come on top?

1686171,comment,1685258,1685258,0,0,wccrawford,,,"The top-rated comments have a lot of good info, but I'm going to boil it down for what I look for:<p>40 hour workweek.  Overtime only happens during an emergency.  That means you NEVER schedule overtime.<p>Accurate requirements and bonus skills.  Don't ask for 7 years in a language that has existed for 4 years.  Make it clear if experience in other languages is acceptable, and the candidate can get up to speed on a relatively new language on the job.  For a good programmer, this isn't hard.<p>No fancy language.  No 'rockstar' or 'code ninja' talk.  Anyone who is realistic about their skillset will not call themselves that.<p>Flexibility in interviewing.  Good programmers already have a busy life.  If you want them, you have to work with them.  Especially if they live any distance from your office.  Be willing to interview via internet/telephone first, and have them travel only if necessary.  (I once had a guy 3 hours from me ask me to a lunch interview.  I declined because I figured he was just milking the company for lunch and had no intention of hiring me.)<p>Adequate pay.  Benefits are nice, but they don't put food on the table.  And with enough pay, employees can buy all the benefits I want.  As someone said earlier, your foosball table isn't on my list of requirements.<p>Unit testing.  Without unit testing, life is a LOT harder.<p>Don't play games.  If you say you'll call someone back, do it.  Don't wait for the candidate to call and 'ask for the job'.  That means they're desperate, not that they're good or loyal.  If an interviewer tells me that they'll call me, I hold them to their word.<p>The above are the absolute necessities.  Below are things I like to see:<p>Languages/environments that I enjoy.  If you deploy on Linux and run Ruby, those things interest me.  Showing that you are on top of the newest technologies or methodologies means you are open to improvement.  This is also good.<p>""Challenging"".  I hate boredom.  I never want to be bored.  I would much rather go home exhausted from all the thinking than have enough energy that I feel like coding at home.  And I do code at home when I'm bored at work.<p>Telecommuting.  I find that I don't choose to do this, but companies that trust their employees enough to do this are better to work for.  It also probably means they have a way to measure whether someone is working or not that doesn't involve a rat.  That means things are a little more fair.",1284376447

Much more important to stability and sanctity of markets is transparency and effective regulation.  Traders by design are trained to find inefficiencies to exploit -- that's how they make money.  If some traders have discovered that by having computers trade really quickly, they can get an edge - well, that's kind of the point of trading.  I think this paper is right to point out that high frequency trading has little to no impact on the overall marketplace.",1284376143

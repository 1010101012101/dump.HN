9367998,comment,9367235,9367235,0,0,notacoward,,,"I&#x27;ve seen many criticism of agile/scrum as they (don&#x27;t) apply to long-term or systems-software environments, but another disconnect I think people need to know about is with open source.  Here&#x27;s the &quot;upstream first&quot; development model typically used by Red Hat (my employer) and others.<p>(1) Company decides to devote resources to a feature.<p>(2) Developer writes code and submits patches <i>upstream</i> (e.g. to the Linux kernel).<p>(3) Upstream takes some indeterminate amount of time to get patches into a release.<p>(4) Company defines a <i>downstream</i> (i.e. commercial) release based on a particular upstream release.<p>(5) The possibly-pristine but also possibly-unrecognizable code from (2) is pulled from the upstream release into the downstream tree.<p>(6) More testing, debugging, tweaking, etc. on the downstream tree yields an actual release.<p>Just in (3) we see one part of the problem: upstream quite likely isn&#x27;t agile/scrum themselves.  Often they don&#x27;t care about a particular vendors&#x27; release schedules; if they do, then someone would argue they&#x27;re &quot;dump and run&quot; fake open source, and not a true independent upstream.  They&#x27;re almost <i>certainly</i> not going to give a crap about sprints or story points or anything else about the local agile/scrum process.  These methodologies pretty much don&#x27;t work unless everyone is completely committed, and with separate upstream/downstream that&#x27;s just not the case.<p>Even with everyone on board, the disconnect between (2) and (4) is a problem.  Pushing code upstream and pulling it downstream are two separate tasks, even if they&#x27;re done by the same person, and there&#x27;s this big gap between them.  At best, this makes scheduling more complicated.  More often, it makes agile/scrum style fine-grain scheduling and tight coordination impossible.  Measuring &quot;velocity&quot; and all that isn&#x27;t possible when there&#x27;s so much externally imposed variability.<p>For something that&#x27;s long term <i>and</i> systems-oriented <i>and</i> open source, these methodologies are practically useless.  Actually they&#x27;re worse than useless, as they misdirect effort and interrupt useful work.  YMMV.",1428937132

9367993,comment,9367235,9367235,0,0,phamilton,,,"I always try to differentiate between Agile and agile. Agile (proper noun) is the overly defined practice of scrums and points and backlog grooming etc. agile is the practice of continuous iteration at all levels. Agile is a great starting point, but if you aren&#x27;t challenging the prescribed format and iterating on your process itself then you are missing the point of agile.<p>We have found, for instance, that the 3 questions of standup are pretty useless. They make each person feel like they are justifying their existence at the company. By dropping those questions and framing it in terms of a deliverable we found the meetings to be far more productive and better for morale.<p>We&#x27;ve decided to give ourselves 1 day into the sprint to better guage progress so we can define achievable sprint deliverables, as we don&#x27;t often know enough information during sprint planning.<p>Each of these is set up as an experiment, designed to solve an identified problem with our workflow.

Kind of like very tall people with an athletic disposition should consider playing basketball. On the surface it is unfair to those under 6 feet tall but the NBA, being a market, is most concerned with attracting the talent that should be playing basketball rather than providing a level playing field to those who aspire to play.<p>In that sense, the market isn&#x27;t about providing fairness to all players but for allocating talent and abilities.<p>In regards to exploiting the poor, I think that sort of mind-set often results in a dangerous kind paternalism.

We don&#x27;t really have the computer vision, the robot dexterity, the high capacity batteries, the fuzzy logic, etc to make this work. We dont have it today and we probably won&#x27;t have it anytime soon. Heck, we don&#x27;t even have a useful home robot yet! Where&#x27;s the Apple //e or Commodore 64 of robots?<p>If anything makes sense, its to build an automated hotel from scratch, not try to shoehorn in solutions.  Self-cleaning toilets, self-making beds, roomba-like devices, etc so that a majority of the housekeeping work is done.  In other words make your problem fit the limits of technology and don&#x27;t be afraid to break from tradition. We didn&#x27;t build robotic horses in the early 20th century. We built cars with four wheels and we paved down expensive roads to drive them on. Dirt roads passable for horse and buggy were a non-starter for cars. We all just ate up that expense for the convenience of owning a car.<p>The problem here is that housekeeping labor is dirt cheap and robots are crazy expensive. What&#x27;s the incentive here to do these things? If there&#x27;s an industry that&#x27;s dying for cost savings, it won&#x27;t be the hotel industry.  Now look at, say, unionized auto manufacturers or unionized public sector workers. Lots of trivial easy to automate jobs there. Why aren&#x27;t city buses driving themselves? Or drones writing parking tickets? Or robots laying down asphalt? Or robots walking a beat? Or teaching a class? That&#x27;s where I could see some advancement. A lot of municipalities are looking at their retiring baby boomer workforces who negotiated very generous pensions via a corrupt political process and now don&#x27;t want to fall into that trap again.",1428936888

The number of misconceptions he presents reads like someone who has never bothered to research agile, but only knows what consultants have taught him.<p>I think the number 1 misconception is the sprints. He seems focused on 2 \nweeks as being the requirement, when it&#x27;s on the recommendation. Some team have gone as long as 4 weeks. The whole point to a sprint is that dedicated time to a delivery with fast feedback from the customers. It&#x27;s mainly so you can fail early, ail often. It&#x27;s much better to spend 2-4 weeks building the wrong product than 6 months.<p>Second, his claims that product development, research and design, and architecture don&#x27;t belong in a sprint are also misinformed. The focus on user stories to remind people that they need to focus on users, not gold plating. In any technical project, there are a plethora to improve on the design. People can (and have) sat down and refactored and &quot;rearchitected&quot; for days and days. At the end, they build beautiful systems that don&#x27;t offer any advantage to the customers, or have implemented a number of features the customer didn&#x27;t want, or have fixed a series of concerns the customer wasn&#x27;t concerned with. There is give and take of course, as the engineers needs to give feedback to help the customer understand the benefits of the feature or risks of not fixing the issue, but those need to happen first before people go off and construct digital masterpieces.<p>Third, micromanagement. If you have endless meetings in agile, you&#x27;re definitely not doing it right. The 3 big meetings, planning, retrospective, and demo, are ones that take the most time. Standups take no more than 15 minutes. The other tasks, meaning, backlog grooming and prioritization should not involved your sprint team. Those need to be done offline by the product owner. Agile may be about teams, but you still need strong leadership.<p>The only point of his that has any relevance is the last one, where consultant firms have made big bucks spinning out variations of agile because people just can&#x27;t understand how simple it is.",1428935912

9367835,comment,9367235,9367235,0,0,cmdkeen,,,"To go through some of the points I fundamentally disagree with:\n&quot;There is no place for an actual senior engineer on a Scrum team&quot; - There absolutely is, who is peer reviewing the code, working with the BAs to design the architecture, identifying the technical dependencies in the backlog? Scrum is not a methodology for writing code, it is for getting a series of tasks done. All the things a senior dev needs to do on top of code can be broken into tasks, Scrum adds a weekly &quot;is this still the most important set of things to be doing?&quot; meeting into the mix.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s aggressively short-term, by design&quot; - The whole post talks about 6 week projects. Scrum is terrible for that as it imposes far too many meetings. Scrum works for the complex space where you say &quot;12-36 months&quot; as your gut feel estimate. It is a reaction to the waterfall world where you&#x27;d discover 2 years in you weren&#x27;t building what the business wanted.<p>&quot;It has no regard for the programmers&#x27; career needs or desires&quot; - Stories make for excellent opportunities for juniors to &quot;own&quot; bits of work from initiation to completion. Old school projects provided very little opportunity for juniors to work on requirements gathering and thus a big chicken and egg problem for promotion. It also offers plenty of opportunity to interact with your customers, which is almost always a good way to get promoted.<p>&quot;The story points are there to track productivity&quot; - Oh noes the people paying you want to know how long the project is going to take to be done. The talk of many status meetings seems decidedly anti-Scrum and is an excellent example of the sort of thing that people should be screaming about in retrospectives.<p>&quot;It punishes R&D&quot; - Ironically it can be a really useful opportunity to conduct R&D. Scrum makes you have something measurable and a time frame in which to conduct it, which makes for an easier sell than an open ended request. I think what annoys some is when they get shut down too quickly, or are forced into taking a less technically interesting approach that delivers enough business value. Scrum isn&#x27;t there for pure research into the theoretical, but then no-one is claiming it is.<p>Killing businesses - Much like every tabloid headline everything can kill you. Value destroying mergers exist in abundance, and poor leadership/management is a real killer. Plenty of companies do very well out of Scrum, especially when they are in a cost centre environment.<p>I might sound rather &quot;no true Scotsman&quot; when it comes to Scrum but there are only a few things you need to do to be &quot;doing Scrum&quot;. What it does give you is a powerful question to ask, and a regularly mechanism to raise it via the retrospective - &quot;why are we doing X when it isn&#x27;t in Scrum?&quot;.",1428935716

It&#x27;s a process of observing and learning about the world around you, coming up with ideas... etc.</i><p>It is all the things you list <i>and</i> a roll of the dice. It is working very very hard and also getting lucky.<p><i>just continuing to come up with new ways to make your boss&#x27;s life easier.</i><p>This is getting back to my original point: you are thinking incredibly small. We are talking about a societal problem. The GP wrote:<p><i>your two options are to be perpetually poor (basically limiting you to a life of indentured servitude), or to out-compete your rivals and achieve an upper-middle class to upper class income</i><p>You do realize that what you&#x27;re describing falls on the &quot;out-compete your rivals&quot; side of that scale, right? It isn&#x27;t a rebuttal to what GP was saying, because it&#x27;s just an example of it.<p><i>Higher education is an investment and comes with risk</i><p>And who is making that investment? In most developed countries, the state has determined it has an interest in an educated populace, and pays for people to go to college. Young people graduate debt-free, and are able to do all this innovating you&#x27;re talking about. For some reason in the United States, we look to private institutions to fund education.<p><i>you don&#x27;t need to pay back your debt by going through the process of filing bankruptcy</i><p>You realize that student loan debt is incredibly hard to discharge through bankruptcy? And Congress has made it even more difficult in the last decade.<p>So, to clarify, in most developed countries, the state takes on the risk from education (just like health care!). In the US, who takes on the risk? Not the bank that does the lending - the government guarantees the debt! But not the government, either, because they&#x27;ve made it nearly impossible to discharge the debt. No, the risk falls almost entirely on the borrower, the individual in that trio that is least able to absorb the risk.<p><i>but you can live the life of leisure you so desire then.</i><p>This is not about leisure, it&#x27;s about having the freedom to have a role as a human being separate from your role in the capitalist system. It&#x27;s about not having to live your life in fear of losing what little you have, and being able to make choices that maximize factors that have nothing to do with capital.<p><i>Both of you complain about a lack of imagination and then fail to offer any sort of alternative, just further complaining.</i><p>This is the same argument I heard from people who supported the Iraq war during the worst of its quagmire phase. My response was that there were no good options (other than not having gone there in the first place), but that doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t point out the problem.<p>In this case, there isn&#x27;t much an individual can do to change a society that has been withered and corrupted by corporate control. We have to live in it. But that doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t also point out that there are better ways to live.",1428935646

The email would 1) state exactly what was delivered to date in terms of hours spent, equivalent hourly value based on my rate 2) assurance that the client has access to all assets and source files as a showing of good faith and 3) a short, very specific statement that the contract is now terminated with no further work delivered, payments made or communications outside of legal channels.<p>Then walk away and look for other clients. File every communication the client sends you, save somewhere in PDFs and make hard copies. Any response you send should say simply &quot;This information has been retained for my attorney.&quot; Respond that way to the client for everything. Say nothing else (very important). Eventually they&#x27;ll either get the message and walk away or take some sort of action.

Had a bad experience? Well, you were doing it wrong. It&#x27;s not an issue with the system.<p>I recently worked at a place that was the text book example of agile/scrum development methodologies -- Which I don&#x27;t mean figuratively, I mean in the literal sense, their big claim to fame was that they were the subject of a case study on the success of Agile methodologies. So, having worked in a place that was studied for &quot;getting it right,&quot; it&#x27;s extremely annoying to see all critiques of agile had waved away under the flag of &quot;you did it wrong&quot;<p>Just about every complaint in the article existed at this place as well. For me, at the tip top of the list was meetings. Planning would take <i>hours</i>. Sometimes it would be split up over two days. That is two days out of the 10 you have available for development eaten up by talking about <i>what</i> you&#x27;re going to develop. Then there&#x27;s a meeting to show what we did in those 10 days. Then another meeting to talk about what we <i>think</i> we did in those 10 days and how it could be better (which was of course done through stupid time wasting games (&quot;I wish I could have ___&quot; &quot;I was happy when ___&quot;, &quot;I should start doing ___&quot;))<p>Then layer on top of all that a whole hierarchy of people whose whole job description is to <i>be</i> &quot;agile&quot; -- which not a single developer was able to explain to me the meaning since the day I started.<p>I&#x27;m ranting too much, but the whole agile thing just gets under my skin.

Well, before clicking on it, I said to myself, &quot;I wonder where Davida ranks?&quot; (query the list of most valuable). So, yeah, I&#x27;ve thought about this subject a lot, and I really appreciate this beautiful website which presents all this data in an easily readable way.<p>In the spirit of constructive criticism, I would suggest the following changes which might make the site more useful for people like me who run calculations on asteroid mining for fun:<p>1) Make the formulas for value and cost explicit somewhere easily found on the site. Maybe it&#x27;s there somewhere, but I can&#x27;t find it.<p>2) Make it possible to alter the variables to allow exploring different scenarios.  For example, the cost in $/(km/s) of delta-v depends upon the technology used.  Maybe have different selections (chemical rockets, nuclear rockets, solar sail, cool unknown technology, magic fairy asteroid whales) which have different costs associated with them.  This would change the rankings of which asteroids would be more profitable, since high metal asteroids with a high delta V cost are more profitable if more accessible. The opposite effect occurs if there is a technology which lowers mining and processing costs (such as directed solar heating and in-situ smelting). It would be nice to tweak that cost too.  Being able to change technology scenarios makes this site much more fun.<p>3) Show some estimate of ore concentration. Yeah, I know the data isn&#x27;t exactly definitive. Spectra don&#x27;t give you good information on internals.  But an estimate is being used in there somewhere, it would be interesting to show it, especially if it could be compared with earthling ores.",1428934499

People who aren&#x27;t actually developing anything feel like the perfect example of people who shouldn&#x27;t be at standups, and certainly shouldn&#x27;t be speaking at them.<p>Again Scrum relies on empowerment, with the Product Owner being the &quot;single wringable neck&quot; whose career is tied to the project and who has the buyin from management to get stuff done.

There is no prescriptive answer, if you have a problem with defects then fix it, or develop a system to deal with them. You don&#x27;t have to bring a bug into sprint after all, and if you do then get your Project Owner to drop an equivalent bit of work out.\nb) Refinement is a crucial part of the process, if you can&#x27;t break up the task into 1/2 weeks worth of work for a team odds are you don&#x27;t fully understand the task, which means you can&#x27;t provide forward estimation, which means management can&#x27;t trust you&#x27;re numbers.\nc) &quot;Project Managers&quot; don&#x27;t exist in Scrum, so a PM consultant guiding you on agile feels very, very wrong.<p>If your organisation can&#x27;t commit to you working full (pretty much) time on a project working on a set of things that have been committed to without pulling you in another direction then odds are Scrum isn&#x27;t going to work for you.<p>Scrum is very clear that there are certain things you need to do in order to say you&#x27;re doing Scrum.

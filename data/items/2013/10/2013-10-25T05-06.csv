My thought was that the VPN server would mostly see encrypted ssl data since I use HTTPS Everywhere and by using encrypted DNS they can&#x27;t tell which sites I am visiting.<p>However, it has recently come to my attention that someone else has control of the OpenDNS dashboad. Essentially, this means that whoever it is can view all the sites I visit and block me from sites of their choosing which they have. I left an auto clicker running all night to rate thousands of girls on an online dating site which lead to hundreds of messages. hehe...<p>I thought the dating site would block me but instead whoever has control of the OpenDNS dash board decided to block everyone on the VPN server from accessing the site. Probably because I spammed their logs. I can still access it just fine using any other DNS provider.

So if you think of pi as an RNG, then the chances of finding a run of N digits equal to another number with N digits is (1/10) to the power of N, which quickly becomes intractible.<p>In reality the digits of pi are biased, so finding a particular number of N digits is even less likely.<p>It would be easier to search for that number by randomly seeding an RNG then searching the RNG output for the number. Then you could just store the seed+offset, which may be significantly less than the Shannon limit. But since the chance of encountering such a number is (1/256)^N, it quickly becomes impossible. And even if it weren&#x27;t, the receiver would need to invoke the RNG [offset] times, which will be a massive number of times due to the probabilities involved. So it&#x27;s not like you could precompute the index: the receiver still needs to compute the answer, which requires just as many computations as the sender.<p>In general, the closer you try to get to the Shannon limit, the more computation that is required. And perfect compression is impossible in practice except in constrained cases, so I&#x27;d speculate it requires infinite computational resources.",1382679465

I get that people are worried about a slippery slope and boundaries, but this is clearly a better user experience for someone who searched for Southwest Airlines. Put yourself in the position of a human being who just performed a search for Southwest Airlines, would you honestly be angry with that result? No, of course not.<p>It&#x27;s ironic that every time one of these &quot;omg, google is pushing organic search results off the page&quot; posts comes up, it&#x27;s the general public who&#x27;s obsessed with dollars, whereas Google seems to be concerned for the user. Google makes a ton of money off of advertising because they know how to provide useful user experience.

The link is: http://www.businessinsider.com/boxnet-2011-9<p>My question is: why not? I understand that the best way for a two-person team to get a prototype up is by bringing up 3 EC2 machines with PostgreSQL on one, MongoDB on another, and the Rails stack on the third. This is when you have no money; but it seems that even when a company has closed a post-Series A round and has plenty of money, there is still resistance to buying a huge Oracle/Sun box with terabytes of RAM and petabytes of storage on a SAN, and instead there&#x27;s usually a team of engineers doing life support on a Mongo or Cassandra cluster. It&#x27;s worth pointing out that three engineers at $100K each is probably the amount one would pay for a few huge boxes.",1382678115

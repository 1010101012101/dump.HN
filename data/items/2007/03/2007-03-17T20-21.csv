I started crawling News YC over night at a slow rate, and it is still going, so many of the latest links and comments are not indexed yet.<p>I threw the code together, so feel free to report any bugs you encounter.  However, I won't have time to touch this for the next few days.<p>I imagine at some time News YC will have a search feature implemented (it may even be today with all the recent changes), so Paul, let me know if you want this removed.",1174164761

On many levels, it's your conventional bookmarking site: you add URLs via the web interface, a bookmarklet or the browser plugin (IE and FF), add tags, add friends and explore websites bookmarked by others.<p>Slightly different is the idea of collections: all your bookmarks are part of ongoing projects, usually concerned with researching an assignment or a purchase.""<p><a href=""http://mashable.com/2007/03/17/snipitron/"">http://mashable.com/2007/03/17/snipitron/</a>",1174164752

4777,comment,4776,4776,0,0,danielha,,,"Pretty funny anecdote, even if having a relative purchase the item is a bit on the sketchy side. But I definitely understand having to show your business at its best in crucial situations.<p>I wonder how one would analogize this to a social network-based website where an influential blogger might be visiting to review. Would one populate the place with a buzzing community? Script certain features to respond flawless to expected invocations? It's much more manufactured (and wrong) in this case.",1174164380

Seek opportunities to learn or try something new, something with uncertain outcomes.""<p>I liked that part. Working in startups is exciting and starting one is even more exhilarating. For years, I've always been interested in pursuing a startup, but it was more recently that I decided/discovered that there is nothing else I could do that would leave me satisfied.<p>On another note, I just recently finished reading your interview in Jessica's book. Good luck on that next adventure of yours; I'll be interested to see what you're going to be up to.",1174163133

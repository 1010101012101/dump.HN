Everyone I know well (close friends, housemates etc) are on my mobile. All my aquaintances from university I keep touch with on facebook. Facebook reminds me of birthdays and tells me what their up to in my news feed. Finally I keep all my business contacts in piles of business cards on my desk. One pile for archive, one for people I need to contact soon and one for people I'm awaiting response from. I can even easily tag people by writing metadata on the back of the card.",1172666970

If someone could update the submit page so that it accepts something like ?url=site.com&title=foobar in the url it would be great. <p>At least now its easy to drag and drop from the page the url and title. Any one know a way to get prepopulation to work?",1172665266

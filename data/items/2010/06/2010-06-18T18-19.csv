1443265,comment,1442756,1442756,0,0,ramy_d,,,"Not sure if i understood, but here's my summary from what i got from this:<p>In fewer words, the argument is this<p><pre><code>  std::vector<std::string> get_names();
  std::vector<std::string> const names = get_names();
</code></pre>
Passing by value causes a lot of under-the-hood moving and copying which is slow. but we will learn later why this is actually correct.<p><pre><code>  get_names(std::vector<std::string>& out_param );
  std::vector<std::string> names;
  get_names( names );
</code></pre>
Passing by reference causes the need for many extra lines of code to be written throughout the code base, no more constants, mutating variables, other crap no one ever told you about when learning about pointers.<p>The solution to both of these is to use ""RValue expressions"".
RValues are expressions that create anonymous temporary objects.<p>When defining variables, using RValues allows transferring ownership of, in this case a dynamically allocated string array (vector), from the source vector to the target vector.<p>When using functions, returns are also anonymous temporary objects, so we transfer the resources from the return value to the target value in the same way as with variables.<p>Oh wait, the compiler actually takes care of optimizing stuff for you, it's called Return Value Optimization (RVO) and it works like this:<p><pre><code>  std::vector<std::string> names = get_names();
</code></pre>
Oh shit, isn't this what we wrote as a first example that's expensive slow? yeah well, apparently there's nothing to worry about. use this.<p>Do pass a function within a function, because then you're passing rvalues as parameters which is unicorn-level magic<p><pre><code>  std::vector<std::string> sorted_names2 = sorted( get_names() );
</code></pre>
RVO optimizations aren't required by any standard, but ""recent versions of every compiler I’ve tested do perform these optimizations today.""<p>Don't pass a variable by reference and then make an explicit copy of its values - that defeats the whole purpose of what we are trying to talk to you about<p>Guideline: Don’t copy your function arguments. Instead, pass them by value and let the compiler do the copying.<p>Lesson: don't explicitly copy variable references, just get their values and the compiler will copy optimize for you",1276887438

The problem is that the positive campaigns don't really make the headlines.

1443232,comment,1442756,1442756,0,0,jheriko,,,"This is very wrong for so many reasons and misses probably the most important reasons to pass by copy...<p>The example of the sorted functions is striking - because the compiler should be able to produce the same quality of code from both cases - the fact that it doesn't suggests that the compiler is not that smart. The r-value, l-value distinction is, in this case, unimportant - because of const the l-value can not be modified, as long as you don't use const_cast or forget a volatile keyword etc. elsewhere the compiler can safely assume that it really will remain const. I'll have to play with this myself I guess cos I might be missing something here that looking at bytes would reveal... but it seems that your example should fail to show any difference on a good compiler.<p>Worse though is that the const-reference and explicit copy is done at all - what possible reason could there be? This is where you should use pass by copy /anyway/, before your argument about speed, because you quite explicitly need to work with a copy. If you chose a suitable example you would see the opposite... unless your compiler is smart enough to treat your redundant copy as if it was a const-reference, which, e.g. the MS C++ compiler does infact do.<p>The important point I think that was missed though is to always pass small things by value - throwing heap pointers around to be dereferenced is typically much more expensive than using the stack - your compiler might optimise it away for you, but especially if you aren't using const references/pointers it can be difficult. Imagine your compiler is not smart - passing a 4/8-byte value as a reference to a 4/8-byte value is just silly. This is probably the most common case - ints, floats, doubles and even small structs will go on the stack, or better.",1276886825

That doesn't mean that taking 40% of your wages as distributions and skipping FICA on them is actually aboveboard.<p>The big differences between S and C corps is that C corps pay federal corporate tax and C corps have preferred stock.<p>I also have to add, at severe risk of getting smacked down by 'grellas, that I think your argument about ""the reasons why S-Corporations get this break"" is unsupported by evidence. In fact, when I read the ""Opinion"" sections of court cases involving decisions about distros versus wages (every one of which I found finds for Revenue and not the company owner), I see things like:<p><i>Dr. Sadanaga performed substantial services on behalf of petitioner. The characterization of the payment to Dr. Sadanaga as a distribution of petitioner's net income is but a subterfuge for reality; the payment constituted remuneration for services performed by Dr. Sadanaga on behalf of petitioner. An employer cannot avoid Federal employment taxes by characterizing compensation paid to its sole director and shareholder as distributions of the corporation's net income, rather than wages. Regardless of how an employer chooses to characterize payments made to its employees, the true analysis is whether the payments represent remuneration for services rendered. Spicer Accounting, Inc. v. United States, 918 F.2d 90 (9th Cir. 1990); Joseph Radtke, S.C. v. United States, 895 F.2d 1196 (?th Cir. 1990).</i><p>The question doesn't appear to be ""does your company deserve a break"". Rather, it's pretty straightforwardly: ""is this money you're earning as compensation for your work, or is this money you're earning as compensation for the downside risk of an investment you hold"".<p>I'm sorry that you feel like I'm calling you shady. I don't even know you. I don't think you <i>are</i> shady. But this business of allowing S-Corp owners to exempt themselves from half their FICA obligation just because of a quirk in how they file taxes is, as I see it, shady.",1276886335

You're using a definition of polymorphism that is independent of C++ and applying it to C++, which is certainly a valid exercise, but you haven't bothered to tell us what your definition is or explain why it applies to each example.

What name is polymorphic here?  I suppose you can say that foo is polymorphic if you attribute the coercion operation to foo, but that's not the way I think about it.  foo is called after the coercion.

A well capitalized business is a good business. The intended operation of an S-corp, and what is currently incentivized through the tax structures in place, is this: an S-corp owner takes a ""reasonable salary"" (as defined above), but enjoys pass-through tax status on the remainder of the income. They pay federal withholding on this amount, but benefit from a lack of SS or FICA taxes. The primary source of capitalization in a small business is the primary shareholder. That is, in tough times, the owner will have to contribute money back in to the business in order to sustain it.

Not sure if those happen all over or not, but here in the Raleigh area, there's a guy who hosts a networking event about once a quarter that's targeted at people in this area who are connected to each other, through him, on LinkedIn.<p>I find those kind of events valuable, but you have to separate a lot of chaff from the wheat, ya know.  That is, in a given night, you might meet 70 people and collect 50 business cards, but maybe only one or two of those people will actually offer any kind of mutually beneficial connection in the future.<p>As for LinkedIn itself, yeah, I occasionally get cold contacts from people who said ""I saw your profile, looks like you're interested in some of the same stuff I am, let's meet"" or ""Looks like you're an entrepreneur, I like meeting people like that, let's grab coffee.""  Some of those connections have been some of the more interesting / useful ones I've made, to be honest.<p>Other thoughts: leverage former co-workers or classmates.  Want to meet a professor who teaches a certain topic, because you think he might have useful info or be a potential advisor? Maybe a coworker graduated from that school and knows him/her.  Don't be shy about calling around and asking people.  Maintain a big list of connections, even if they're ""weak ties""  Weak ties can be very useful:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_ties#Weak_tie_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_ties#Weak_tie_hyp...</a><p>Also, Barcamp or similar events.  If your town doesn't have a HN Meetup / Open Coffee Club or something similar, start one.  If there is one, join it and attend.  Join ""business development"" related Meetups on Meetup.com, if there are any near you.<p>There's potential to meet people all over the place, look around.  Does a local community college or university offer free seminars for entrepreneurs? Attend those, even if the content isn't all that interesting, just to meet the other people.  Go to a Startup Weekend.  Hang out in the ""business"" section at Barnes & Noble or Borders and strike up conversations with random people.  If you see somebody reading an interesting book in the cafe at Barnes & Noble or Borders, strike up a conversation.<p>Edit: another thought on LinkedIn.  Use it to find and connect with people from former employers, who worked in different departments, even if you didn't know them well.  In my experience, most people will accept link requests if you actually worked at the same company at the same time, even if they don't really know you on a deep level.  So, if you are, say, a techie, and looking to make some biz dev connections... go back to a former employer, link with the marketing / biz dev / sales people from there, and message them and arrange to meet for coffee or drinks or what-have-you.  Even if they can't help you themselves, the'll likely have other contacts they can refer you to.",1276885498

You'll find plenty of analyses on Google of people's attempts to skirt payroll taxes with distributions and then getting smacked down in IRS audits with 20% negligence penalties attached. The problem is that in order to catch those people, the IRS has to aggressively audit S Corps and take people to tax court, which is (a) a waste of everyone's time and money and (b) a nuisance for S-Corps who are playing by the rules.<p>All that's happening here is that a bright line is being created where a dim and flickering line was previously. That's a step forward. The notion that there was some social benefit to this quirk of the tax code is silly. If you try to defend it, you don't get to complain about the tax code being too complex anymore.<p>The purpose of an S-Corp is to allow the flexibility of an LLC while allowing companies to create real equity incentive plans for employees.

You're getting a room, with a door that locks. You're getting regular cleaning service, even if you don't need/want it. You're getting a private bathroom. You're getting privacy from the locals even if you don't need/want it. You're getting geographically limited because you can only get a hotel room in a place where the economics support building a hotel that has at least a few dozen rooms. I mean, hotels that have only one or two rooms aren't very profitable. Which means that hotels tend to concentrate in central business districts and other places where land is expensive.<p>The point is, all these features that are bundled together have real costs. If you don't need those features, then you ideally you shouldn't have to pay for them.<p>This is sort of like asking why Zipcar is different from a rental car company.

1443117,comment,1442546,1442713,0,0,grellas,,,"These points probably are not relevant to the ""interview process"" but they can often be vital to the economic decision whether to join a startup:<p>1. What equity will I get and what form will it take?
2. What are the total outstanding shares in the company (fully diluted)?
3. What is the total dollar value of the investor liquidation preference?<p>You can get 100,000 options vesting over 4 years, for example, but this could represent potentially 1% of the company (if 10M shares are outstanding) or one-tenth of 1% if 100M shares are outstanding or any other percentage depending on the total capitalization structure. In the one case, on a $100M acquisition (assuming pro rata participation by all parties), you would get $1M and, in the other, $100K. Key point: the absolute number of shares is much less important than the percentage they represent of company ownership.<p>Same scenario but assuming preferred stock in place holding $50M of liquidation preference and full participation rights beyond the preference amount: in the $100M acquisition scenario, your 100K of options would net you $500K if there are 10M shares outstanding (1% of the $50M that is left after payment of the $50M liquidation preference) and $50K if there are 100M (.01% of the net $50M amount). Key point: outstanding liquidation preferences can (and often do) materially reduce the equity return to common shareholders, particularly if the company is sold in a marginal acquisition (in an extreme case, the preferred investors can force a sale where founders and employees get nothing).<p>Of course, if you haven't vested in full, and you don't have any accelerated vesting on acquisition, the numbers get shaved even more. Say you worked 2 years at the startup on a 4-year vesting schedule, you would net $500K in the best case under the above examples (1% potential ownership that is 50% vested, no liquidation preference) and $25K in the worst case (.01% potential ownership that is 50% vested with $50M liquidation preference).<p>These days, many who join startups as employees after the early stages are generally aware of the above issues but it never hurts to remember them <i>if</i> the major reason you are joining is for the hope of a large potential equity payout (if the terms you get are good apart from the equity, and you see it as more of a ""tip"" if things happen to go well, then these issues are of course much less important to you).<p>Capitalization questions are awkward to raise in an interview but are important if equity is key to the offer.

Same if you're self-employed; in that case one pays both the employee and employer contributions, but the latter are deductible for calculating taxable income payable to the IRS.<p>Here's what I don't understand about the people who are complaining.

Similarly, if I form a partnership with my buddy, either or both of us who are general partners also have unlimited liability. As an individual or a partner, I can also hire people, make business purchases and deduct those expenses for tax purposes.

So if I have an irresponsible employee who is negligent or runs up debts in the company's name, my personal/family assets are protected from business-related liability claims. This protection is nothing to sneeze at, and indeed, I'm looking at reorganizing for that exact reason.<p>So why is it, exactly, that those who enjoy the considerable benefits of limited liability for their business operations should <i>also</i> be able to exempt part of their annual business gain from social security obligations, whereas a self-employed person, with unlimited financial liability, can not?",1276884398

POST is not, and should be used for requests like ""increment this field"" or ""add a new sub-item to this parent item"" where doing it twice will give a very different result than doing it once.",1276884380

1443096,comment,1442644,1442974,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"Re grammar, thank you for an excellent response.  People often say that language isn't nailed to the floor with one right way of saying things, but that misses the point.  Communication is important, and if a writer doesn't get things right, some of the audience will be lost.<p>I'm intrigued by the emergence of the ""I could care less"" expression.  Here in the UK people look at it, stunned, and are confused as to what the author meant.  It's like ""The proof is in the pudding,"" an expression that clearly derives from something that makes sense in a stand-alone context, but which now can only be understood as an idiomatic, atomic phrase, and which doesn't mean what it actually says.<p>But that's language, which is weird.<p>With regards using existing tools, I largely, but not entirely, agree with you.  It would be useful if languages had clean containment methods/techniques for wrapping existing tools rather than (re-)implementing facilities, but that's a general discussion.<p>And I agree that there's more to a developer than just the programs they write.  That, however, partly makes my point and not yours.  Whether they expend effort writing ""Pythonically"" is, to my mind, a much smaller point than whether they document well, communicate clearly, design effectively, and have a sense of balance.<p>But that's a minor issue.  I suspect we are, in truth, more in agreement than not.",1276884353

My politics are closer to Greenwalds than, say, Glenn Reynolds, but I found this writeup nauseating.<p>What exactly is Greenwald's point?<p>That Adrian Lamo isn't a superhero? Ok! Stipulated!<p>That Kevin Poulsen might have had reasons other than national security and journalistic ethics to run the stories he ran in the fashion he ran them in? Ok! Stipulated!<p>Lamo bad. Poulsen bad. Ok. But it does <i>not</i> therefore follow that Manning is good. Or that Wikileaks is acting ethically and performing a vital service.<p>Greenwald has no new facts to add to our understanding, only opinions about whether it's plausible that Manning could have had access to truly damaging information. Greenwald's opinions about how the DoD manages classified information aren't relevant, because Greenwald has never seriously reported the IA practices in the DoD.<p>Greenwald also chooses to highlight the notion that Manning was leaking information ""to the public"", instead of ""making bank by selling it to China"" (wait, I thought it was implausible that he had valuable information?), and that he may be a whistleblower ""in the purest sense"". But Manning broke an extremely serious set of laws and betrayed his explicit duty to protect that information. If he's right (spoiler alert: he's not), we'll soon know when Wikileaks orchestrates its next media tour around the Manning documents.<p>All Greenwald is doing here is trying to assign people to roles of ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"". He's no more trustworthy than Wired is. And this story isn't about good guys and bad guys.",1276884253

Combined with the absurdity of state laws and general ignorance in most communities, it's a wonder that anyone gets treated at all.<p>As far as I can see the article only mentions the actions of the social workers. It makes no mention of their intelligence or (lack of) well-meaning. (As an aside: ""I only meant well"" is an extremely effective shield against criticism and anyone who uses it should be distrusted. Also, even a truly well-meaning individual can do a lot of harm.)<p>In what way are social workers undervalued? Apparently they can't get anything done due to the laws. How would they get more done if we paid them more?",1340481324

While it's very hard to make a good or great C compiler,  it's not hard to just make a C compiler.

4151633,comment,4151167,4151167,42,0,rcthompson,,,"Incidentally, if you're wondering why this kind of stuff only seems to happen in the brain, in broad terms the answer is this: almost every other cell type in your body has the luxury of committing suicide (technical term: apoptosis) and being replaced by other cells of the same type which are growing and proliferating. For example, if a virus infects one of your intestinal epithelial cells, that cell can trigger it's self-destruct signal pathway (or a cytotoxic T-cell can trigger it externally) and initiate programmed cell death, thereby containing the infection (note that apoptosis functions to effectively demolish the entire contents of the cell, not just tear it apart and release whatever is inside).<p>In contrast neurons generally do not proliferate much after you're born (there's some debate about this, but even so a particular neutron is valuable because of the connections it has made, which are irreplaceable), so having each neutron kill itself when something goes bad would shortly leave you without a functioning nervous system. So neurons have to resort to more ""creative"" measures to clean up problems without destroying their entire cell bodies (e.g. autophagy, in which the cell cordons off a part of itself and then digests it). Naturally, these mechanisms are not as effective as demolishing the entire cell, so some problems can arise that neurons can't handle. But they are programmed not to kill themselves under almost any circumstances, so they continue limping along with only partial functionality or none at all.",1340480903

4151622,comment,4148390,4148658,1,0,rdl,,,"A few issues/questions with that:
1) Local traffic: if this were an enterprise app hosted on premise, with cloud backup, but with some remote users, you'd need to be careful in network configuration.  With firewalls, people also access local apps on different IPs than from outside.  This may not apply, and certainly can be resolved, but would require some visibility for the provider into your network configuration.
2) Failover: To do this really easily as a service, you'd ideally run 100% of traffic through a third party service.  Some of it would get directed into EC2/cloud provider of choice, and some into your colo datacenter.  If you're willing to use something like CloudFlare for DDoS/etc. prevention now, this would be the same compromise.
3) Database: Dealing with all the replication issues.  If it's static content, this is trivial.  Otherwise, you have a consistency problem for databases, etc., and most cloud providers (especially Amazon) want to lock you into weird onsite proprietary data solutions which don't<p>The best system today is probably to host at a facility with great transport to Amazon Direct Connect nodes (e.g. SV1/SV5 in Silicon Valley -- I'm setting this up now), so you've got fast cheap ways to keep your databases replicated between AWS and the free world/your own colo.<p>For inbound traffic, for $20/mo, I'd just do Cloudflare; for higher end, you'd have a lot of choices to make.  (I haven't tried the higher end cloudflare offerings yet; they do seem to address most of the shortcomings, and are still pretty cheap).",1340480752

4151619,comment,4150701,4151541,8,0,MrFoof,,,"To be fair, some of it is Porsche being a low-volume manufacturer for as long as they were, until the introduction of the Cayenne.  Porsche has long stood by its practice of ensuring they make no less than $10,000 front-end on every car they sell.  The fact the Cayman came into existence at all was a bit of a surprise -- that's a car that sells in far fewer numbers than the 911.  Even in its last model year, fewer than 1300 Caymans made its way to the US, a tremendously small number for a car that starts around $55,000.<p>The Cayenne (and to a lesser extent, the Panamera and the upcoming  Macan) increasing overall sales volume is what is allowing them to loosen the reigns on the Boxster and Cayman.  Upon launch the Type 987 Cayman did not have a limited-slip differential.  The refresh did, and now the Type 981 Boxster offers the same torque-vectoring rear diff as the Type 991 911 from Day 1.  Porschephiles aren't a fan of the SUVs and the thing that is the Panamera, but the reality is it lets Porsche further improve its sports cars, and go on crazier exercises in racing and allow for more hyper cars like the 918 Spyder.<p>The Type 987.2 Boxster Spyder and Cayman R were faster around a road course than the base Type 997.2 911 Carrera, despite being significantly cheaper.  Odds are good that this trend will continue with the Type 981 which is further straying from the 911 -- the original Boxster (and even the Type 987) was a cost-control exercise and was heavily parts-binned from the Type 996 911, down to the doors being identical.",1340480713

4151612,comment,4151106,4151405,5,0,jrockway,,,"Remember, this isn't a court where you get to argue your individual case.  If data mining starts affecting insurance premiums, you probably aren't going to notice.  The insurance company is not going to say ""because of your daily McDonald's purchases..."".  They're just going to say, ""effective 6/6/2020, your rate is $x"".<p>People that do ""unusual and unpredictable things all the time"" are so rare that they don't matter at the scale of data mining.  Most people do usual and predicable things, and that assumption is probably worth money.<p>However, a number of factors have to come together for this to work.  First, the insurance companies need to correlate purchases and insurance claim rate.  Then insurance companies need to secretly implement this plan.  Then when you get the letter that says your premiums are being raised, they need you to not switch to a competitor that is undercutting their new rate.  And finally, they'll have to avoid the rage of citizens and legislators.  With their upcoming special status in 2014, it's unlikely that lawmakers are going to let insurance companies do whatever they want.<p>So ultimately, being different isn't going to protect you from data mining, but I think the market will.  Do <i>you</i> want to be the first company to announce they're spying on your purchases?  Do <i>you</i> want to own the grocery chain that's known as the spying one?<p>Probably not.",1340480600
4151611,comment,4149943,4151189,6,0,tete,,,"Okay, mine sounds a bit racist too. Well, actually I think it really does a lot. But I don't really care about what nation is what and stuff, because it all depends on the person doing shit and stuff. Also people are mostly thinking pretty global these days, especially here. So I guess we can assume that especially people on Hacker News don't really waste their energy on such stupid things.<p>It's basically what I get from the media and stuff. You know.... whatever country you live in. They want to tell you that you are great, should be proud and only talk about other's problems. So usually it's best to watch foreign medias to get a good (or pessimistic) view on your country.<p>Actually. Sorry, if that sounds plain, but from my perspective the bigger fear is that the US or China are taking over.<p>Maybe it helps to see Europe more like the states, just still more decentralized. I never really thought about this. In fact this comparison comes from a now US citizen.<p>Of course Germany and France (as well as UK, but they don't really care too much about the EU anyway) are like two strong US states. There may be so rivalry, but with EU and stuff they have the same goals.<p>It isn't like people in US think that some state is going to take over, right?<p>And one doesn't really have to fear much, if it isn't by means of war.<p>I am not from France, so no idea, how exactly they feel, but you have to keep in mind that the ""constitution"" of the EU basically grants everyone very equal voting rights. In fact smaller countries would have gotten even more votes if they hadn't killed it off.<p>There also is no dictator, not even someone in sight. From a democratic point of view Europe's distribution of power is far more even that for example what you see in the US, especially with the recent laws. There is no single person in Europe that has as much privileges as the US president for example.<p>Lets pretend Germany would really take the lead and stuff making Europe one big Germany this wouldn't really harm anyone.<p>So that's why people here are more afraid of a state like the US, which invests way more money (and I speak about percentage) into military than every other nation and which also has a lot of power with IWF, world bank (which aren't even really governmental/democratic) and where they have pretty strong nationalism, etc.<p>Now, nobody really fears the US and stuff. Actually the opposite is partly true. They see how the US struggles with debts, old infrastructure, loosing power to China, etc.<p>What I want to say with all of this is that things like that are more likely to go on in people's heads.<p>And I know this sounded kinda bad, but I actually heard the ""US is struggling with own problems and soon isn't a world power anymore. That's why they do war and tell others about how to do their economy"" quite often lately. Just a few days ago they even showed on the news how all the infrastructure built in sixties makes problems in the US. I guess it was kinda exaggerated, but it sounded like it is a poor country. What I want to say with this is that countries are really, really complex. You can't really say general things about them, cause every time you try to you actually say something that's wrong.<p>So, maybe there are lots of people fearing Germany and I just don't see them. The only thing I can say is that whenever they show the heads of Germany and France they at least pretend to not have any problems with each other and they do it really well.<p>Even if that wasn't a clear answer I hope that helped a bit. Basically the only thing that people worry about currently are Greece, Spain and Italy. Maybe it even is too much. They'd be doing well, if there was no worry. They ""just"" have the problem of everyone worrying, so they don't get any loans, people pull their money from these countries and this creates troubles and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.<p>To come back to the topic a bit. It's pretty much what all these rating agencies do. They say: This country may have troubles to pay back their debts, which causes them to have high interests and so it actually becomes true.",1340480548

Although the OP has made a really good suggestion about how people take gadget reviews personally, he failed to bring up how a general lack of trust also creates a lot of fear and animosity.<p>Ah, and I'll add a possible contributing factor: envy. There may be a quite a lot of envy of the author's voice and audience, and acting out because the person feels powerless to influence their peers, like the author does.<p>The lack of trust and influence that contribute to the generation of such vitriol are actually very tightly linked. As standards for intellectual integrity go down, on a personal and societal level, trust decreases proportionally, and ""influence"" starts to depend more on emotion than reason. Seeing well-reasoned arguments lose again and again, people (quite reasonably) start adapting, start using the ""effective"" strategies for influence like invective, emotionally effective fallacies, and general buffoonery.<p>This is why Fox News is so corrosive. Whatever your politics, the people at Fox are all <i>liars</i>. A clearly biased news channel that bills themselves as ""Fair & Balanced"" - and yet they have a huge audience, and are extremely successful. People learn from this. This is also why people like Blagojevich are so corrosive: even though he (eventually) went to prison, his months of shameless pandering gave people the sense that shame and responsibility are truly outre.

A Mac + VMWare (or Parallels) lets you test on Safari, multiple versions of IE, and Chrome/Opera/Firefox on both Windows, Mac and Linux.<p>Of course, the reason for this is that until very recently Apple wouldn't let any version of OS X run under virtualization on any other platform, so if you wanted to test in Safari you had to have a Mac. I think OS X can now be run virtualized, but that's a very recent change.<p>Aside from browser testing though, having a Unix-based operating system certainly makes development using the open source web stack much easier (though of course you can always run virtualized Ubuntu on Windows).",1340479143

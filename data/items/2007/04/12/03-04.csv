12143,comment,12001,12126,0,0,acheung,,,"I'm in the middle of attempting to do a PhD and a startup at the same time but it's damn hard. I basically don't sleep. Meeting with my co-founder has become sparse as my research demands increase and it's really affecting our progress -- especially since I'm the coder. In short, if I want this to succeed, I have to leave, which basically I've decided to do at the end of this semester.",1176349799

I assume they're building something based on ASP.NET ? (or at least .NET technology)<p>So right now the list of startup companies that use .NET has grown to 2 in YCombinator? Xobni and Loopt (arguably one of the most successful YCombinator investment).<p>PG, any thought on that? ",1176348418

Freelancers are professionals and need income like everybody else.  You may not be able to offer market rates, so do what you can in-house, and make reasonable offers for the things you need to outsource.<p>2. Beg for favors from family and friends.  With people you know well, you <i>can</i> get away with asking for favors for little or no remittance.  It becomes a team effort.  Of course, your friends' goodwill is a limited resource.  Spend it wisely.  If a graphic designer friend makes a logo for your company, and you lose interest two weeks later, she won't be as willing to help on your next project.<p>3. Be persuasive.  There are great ways to get people to help you out, and you can learn to pitch your request so that it sounds better than ""just based on promises."" ;-)  I'm not an expert on this, but two books that get rave reviews are ""The Psychology of Persuasion"" and ""Getting to Yes"".  You can persuade people to help you out if you know how to ask.  Make it a win-win situation.<p>I don't suggest offering equity to contractors right off the bat.  A friend who will work for equity will probably also work for free, with just a few tokens of your appreciation.  And if you're asking someone to do so much work that they <i>need</i> some compensation, maybe they should be a co-founder?<p>Nor do I suggest getting services on loan.  (""We'll pay you once we're funded."")  Investors want you to use their capital to do new work and achieve new milestones, not pay off old debt.  Employees get impatient when they're owed money.  And if you never get funding, it pretty much impedes any ongoing relationship with these people.<p>Hope this helps -- good luck!",1176347053

Some of them might even think it&#x27;s natural to have to use twice as many keystrokes as are required on a modern editor, even another command-line editor, to switch from editing to navigating (as just one example).<p>> I&#x27;m not sure who you&#x27;re trying to save here, the bunch of us seem to be mostly happy with what is really the worst editor we can get except all the others.<p>Yes, except that that is false. Any meaningful comparison is so obviously against vim that I feel like I&#x27;m trying to dissuade True Believers from an irrational belief.",1378976397

There were some embarrassing and traumatic events when I was a child.  Throughout the rest of my childhood there were frequent reminders of the events.  If I brought the events up later to my parent&#x27;s they wouldn&#x27;t acknowledge them, and they strongly discourage me from discussing it.  These were significant events that led to my parent&#x27;s divorce and I repressed them.  When I recalled them later it was very emotional.<p>With regards to research and scientific proof... I don&#x27;t know how you would prove it.  How can others verify my experience.  It&#x27;s not easily repeatable.  Even if it were repeatable... how could you prove something like that in an ethical way without traumatizing people.",1378976289

6372903,comment,6372461,6372860,7,0,lutusp,,,"> I would actually love to hear some specific and insightful criticisms of Vim ...<p>Sure, no problem:<p>* It&#x27;s still a command-line editor. Just like vi.<p>* To perform multiple operations, like moving the cursor around, entering text, deleting text, searching the document, saving and loading files, requires you to switch modes. Just like vi.<p>* It cannot take advantage of the modern computing environment -- mouse navigation, different fonts, text styling, page layout, or anything else. Just like vi.<p>* No clipboard support -- all copying and pasting operations, apart from being another example of bizarre vi incantations requiring the recall of a raft of magic characters, is within vi/vim and disregards the system clipboard.<p>I can say this in vi/vim&#x27;s favor: it&#x27;s a step up from ed, its predecessor.<p>> In today&#x27;s terms, the above &quot;without wasting too much paper during editing&quot; argument translates into &quot;with as few keystrokes as possible&quot;.<p>No, actually, in the vi days, to save paper one had to enter more keystrokes, not fewer. When I wrote Apple Writer, former users of vi were astonished by how few keystrokes were required to accomplish things.<p>> do you have any specific issues with Vim?<p>Just one. It doesn&#x27;t belong in modern times, it belongs in a museum.",1378976126

6372886,comment,6372510,6372510,2,0,tosh,,,"I did not expect this news.<p>When I first heard about HackFWD I thought it was the ideal program to join. They were well positioned as accelerator program specifically looking, optimized & engineered for techies.<p>I was not part of their program but in the last few years I learned to know a bunch of the HackFWD mentors and met a few teams that went through the program and only heard the best about it. So I was curiously following what they did and also encouraged a bunch of teams I met to apply at HackFWD if they fit their profile.<p>I still believe that their hypothesis to focus on technical founders is very smart for an accelerator program (it is way easier to teach marketing & business skills to engineers than the other way round). Also the better you can specify your target audience/hypothesis the better you can focus and build an environment around it and it felt like they did a great job there (even when they ultimately hit some (european) barriers that were hard to overcome).<p>On top of that (besides their focused hypothesis) Europe has an amazing pool of brilliant engineers that at the same time lack a bit of the business savviness if you compare them to founders in the US. So it&#x27;s not only a great global strategy, I believe it especially works well for the local (european) environment, same with having Germany as the base rather than the UK.<p>HackFWD also reminded me a lot of philosophically aligned efforts like Fred Wilson&#x27;s MBA mondays, what Google Ventures do with their lab and 500Startups with their amazing mentoring program/bootcamp on UX and distribution.<p>We ourselves (Blossom.io) ultimately were lucky to get into Seedcamp (one of the leading european accelerator programs) and we&#x27;re very grateful for all their support but it is sad to see another bright star of the european scene gone.<p>Hat tip to Lars for sharing his thoughts and lessons learned. The great thing about building an environment/a community is that even if you &#x27;fail&#x27; you leave something that lives on, and it definitely touched/helped/accelerated a lot of people in the european startup scene that certainly will continue to leave a trail and go on to do great things.<p>Would love to hear from others who were more tightly involved with HackFWD.<p><i>bow</i>",1378975752

In some situations, I definitely find my ability to type (or in general, to edit text) to be the bottleneck in getting things out of my brain and into a file.  In these cases, Vim allows me to trade a bit of brainpower for efficiency in editing, which is great.<p>Other times, I&#x27;m being held up because I&#x27;m not sure what to type, but I prefer to do creative thinking away from the keyboard, so Vim is neither here nor there in those cases.  So basically, the historical argument doesn&#x27;t make sense for me; do you have any specific issues with Vim?",1378975237
6372859,comment,6371932,6372469,1,0,Scienz,,,"At 29 I&#x27;ve also become somewhat paranoid about age-related cognitive decline. From what little I&#x27;ve looked into it, to the extent you go by the fluid and crystallized intelligence dichotomy, fluid tends to peak at around 25 and crystallized peaks somewhere in the 35-55 range (I&#x27;ve heard multiple numbers from different sources), with major decline beginning around 65. Brain mass also peaks around 25 and loses around 2 grams per year thereafter. The intelligence loss seems to be exponential with age - you&#x27;ll drop a lot faster between 60 and 70 than you will between 30 and 40. The different peaks for fluid versus crystallized probably affect life outcomes differently depending on lifestyle and profession, e.g. the saying I used to hear from my physics professors that &quot;If you haven&#x27;t done anything by 30, you never will,&quot; or the Primer quote, &quot;What they do with engineers when they turn 40? They take them out back and shoot &#x27;em.&quot; On the other hand fields requiring vast recall of domain knowledge like law or medicine probably favor the older crowd that have had decades more time to accumulate, even if they lack the high-level abstract problem solving stuff required more in e.g. physics or math.<p>Some relevant links on all that:

6372794,comment,6372461,6372461,1,0,m2mdas,,,"Pasting the reply I gave in r/vim<p>Answer to some of the points,<p><i>Janus</i>: There are divided opinions in vim community about whether distributions should be used or not. I am on the latter side. But still for just checking out I installed Janus a while ago. Yes it is slow, but it turns out that it is as slow as my then `.vimrc` configuration. I tried to track down the problem. It is because of vim&#x27;s blocking behaviour during executing external commands. When you write a buffer or switch to a buffer, syntastic, tagbar, powerline statusline, gitgutter, bufexplorer all execute external command. Vim becomes more slow when `.git` repository grow larger or when saving a large file. So how do you solve the problem? Remove those plugins and install Unite.vim[1] with vimproc[2] asynchronous library.<p><i>Files that change</i>: If you do external edits more frequently then I think it is time to rethink your work-flow. I think there is a common consensus that you should not run live edit in server.<p>* Indenting pastes* :  There is a plugin for that [3] ?<p>* Opening files inside my project <i>: Last I checked command-t was damn fast, don&#x27;t know where slowness comes form. Another alternative is `Unite.vim`  `file/async` source. It is fast at finding files but goes slow while doing ignore-pattern checking. Without the checking it is DAMN FAST. The `phpcomplete/files` source I created for my php autocomplete plugin[4] easily list 4000+ files in seconds.  If you want to list files obeying the patterns in the &#x27;.gitignore&#x27; or &#x27;.hgignore&#x27; files. Checkout my unite-file-vcs[4] plugin. It adds a `file/vcs` source that lists files by issuing `git ls-files` or `hg status -c -m -u` command for `git` or `mercurial` projects respectively.<p></i> Navigating inside files*:  Checkout unite-outline[6]. It shows live output by parsing the current buffer. Unite.vim required. But it does not support css files right now. Adding support should be easy.<p>So the summary of the story. Move to `unite.vim` and friends ;)<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/Shougo/vimproc.vim"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Shougo/vimproc.vim</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/sickill/vim-pasta"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sickill/vim-pasta</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://github.com/m2mdas/phpcomplete-extended"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/m2mdas/phpcomplete-extended</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://github.com/m2mdas/unite-file-vcs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/m2mdas/unite-file-vcs</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://github.com/Shougo/unite-outline"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Shougo/unite-outline</a>",1378974030

The start is less scientific, but as we build better software, with larger N, and bring on the involvement (and attract the attention of) more researchers and doctors, things will build their rigor.<p>If you believe in the vision, of gathering patients together to collect and learn from more real-world data points, in concert with oversight by researchers, then the current implementation is, well, just the current implementation to get us to that end goal, of a more engaged, globally-distributed means of learning from patients as they live and treat their disease.<p>Medical science is fundamentally the study of how inputs to a body relate to outputs of the body (in the scope of treating disease). If we can collect a continuity of these data points in the real-world, among a global populous, you have the potential to understand the disease in ways never before possible.",1378972947

See here: <a href=""http://www.sparkjava.com/readme.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sparkjava.com/readme.html</a><p>In addition, some of their docs link to a Google Code page, which keeps some examples on its index too: <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/spark-java/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/spark-java/</a><p>Lastly, it appears they&#x27;re using GitHub for actual code, and, while they have a Github wiki created, it has no information.<p>I wish I could stress just how important it is to have all of the docs in one centralized location. Somewhere along the line, one of the five places they have examples will get out of date, and it&#x27;ll be difficult to play spot the differences when it&#x27;s replicated everywhere.",1378972937

The symptoms are exactly as you described -- tired all of the time despite 8+ hours of sleep a night, decreased motivation, lack of concentration, inability to learn, and the apneas happen entirely while you&#x27;re asleep so you do not wake up or realize anything is wrong with your sleep except that it is no longer productive. Moreover, if you have gained weight during college, this change can exacerbate your condition. I highly recommend scheduling an overnight study at a sleep lab. It could change your life. Feel free to reach out to me if you end up having the disorder -- my email is cwm55@cornell.edu",1378972841

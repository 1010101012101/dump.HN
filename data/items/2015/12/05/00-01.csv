10680266,comment,10674914,10679040,0,0,analog31,,,"I got the impression that the article was about K-12 education, where the kids aren&#x27;t yet completely separated into STEM and non-STEM tracks. (Some kids get onto an accelerated math track). If the schools that my kids attend are typical, they do extensive amounts of writing in all of their subjects. The kind of writing that you describe was pretty common, through 5th grade.<p>In 6th grade and beyond, the school went to a more traditional math curriculum, I suspect due to milestones such as getting through algebra in 8th grade, etc. For the kids to do more writing in math class requires a choice of what they will spend less time on. Do they learn fewer math topics, get fewer assignments in Social Studies, or get less sleep?<p>Maybe I&#x27;m a freak, but as a student I greatly enjoyed the &quot;pure&quot; nature of math. In other subjects, I found that I could get good grades by basically filling pages with drivel. On the other hand I didn&#x27;t just write down solutions. I was expected to show a derivation, and in many cases, a proof. I have a copy of my high school pre-calc textbook, and a large fraction of the chapter problems are proofs, which I loved. That&#x27;s what motivated me to become a math major in college. Today, the proofs have disappeared.",1449277163

The link between these two is that N-acetylcysteine is used as a treatment for overdose of PA - because of a metabolite which is produced following high consumption of PA (NAPQI). Importantly, this link does not indicate that they have inversely correlated mechanisms of action under normal circumstances. PA may not be worth exploring further, but the understanding of N-acetylcysteine is still worth exploring. <i>Note</i> I do not study this myself, just putting in my two cents.",1449276715

They can essentially launder traffic from within their respective meshes so that any intermediary between them can&#x27;t do attribution. Of course, you have to trust the mix! So what then? Then communication to them has to be encrypted and onion routed, and moreover, continuously sent (even if what is encrypted is the message, &quot;No data here dummy, this is just chaff&quot;) and then that has to be sent along, all so the mix doesn&#x27;t know that you&#x27;re actually communicating anything.<p>It&#x27;s a whole category of research really. Papers like Herd at Sigcomm and Vuvuzela at SOSP are the two latest I&#x27;ve seen and following references there should be helpful.

Altium still has issues with large designs, but it&#x27;s got its advantages, it&#x27;s very easy to work with industrial designers within the Altium ecosystem.

The big two tools also have simulators like PSICE, and integration with RF design tools like Keysight ADS, Genesys, Momentum, Hyperlynx, and HFSS. If your design has any RF components or high speed buses like DDR, PCIe and USB, you need to run your designs through these tools to verify your design.

If you are considering switching, do not wait, just switch. I should have done this sooner.<p>The longer answer:<p>Both tools have drawbacks and the user interface is bizarre in many ways in both of them. That said, KiCad at least is being regularly improved. I got tired of waiting for EAGLE to fix even the most ridiculous UI flaws. It seemed just as if EAGLE wasn&#x27;t really developed anymore, just stuck way back in the 90s.<p>My schematics look much better these days. Hierarchical sheets help, too.<p>The separation of symbols from footprints is a great idea. As a practical example, I already have a small library of Texas Instruments packages (DRC, DRV, etc), which means that I can often just draw a symbol and immediately assign a verified footprint to it. No copying, and the footprints are shared, so if you modify paste coverage once, all parts using that footprint can immediately benefit. This idea is a clear winner.<p>Routing boards takes significantly less time than in EAGLE. Mostly because of the push and shove router — I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d even take on some boards I&#x27;m making these days without it.<p>The layers seem to be better organized: you don&#x27;t get a hundred layers with weird names, the set is clearly defined and it&#x27;s easy to understand what they are used for.<p>3D visualization is really great. I didn&#x27;t think it would be useful, but I can&#x27;t live without it these days. All the components in my libraries now have 3d models attached, even if the model is a simple cube. This helps greatly when designing small stuff that is supposed to go into real enclosures. Exporting to decent CAD packages isn&#x27;t quite there yet (you can do it, but it requires significant effort), but the ability to instantly visualize your board helps a lot already.<p>The library management is as bad as it was in EAGLE. Perhaps slightly better because you can use github repos as sources, but in general it&#x27;s a crappy experience. I hope this will improve in the future.<p>Finally, price is an important consideration. EAGLE is not free. If you do anything commercial, EAGLE suddenly starts to be quite expensive, especially if you want 4-layer boards or larger boards. Other commercial packages are even more expensive. So if you are a serious hobbyist who wants to produce small 4-layer boards at OSHpark, KiCad is really the best option.<p>In general, I see no compelling reason to stick to EAGLE unless you have zero time for learning new things.",1449274311

It goes into interesting discussion about what exactly it is about unemployment that makes people unhappy. Some quotes from the middle of the article:<p>&quot;There is plenty of evidence in support of the hypothesis that the evaluative component of \nwell-being depends on how much one conforms to or deviates from the norms of the \nsocial group one associates with. For unemployment, this means that the harmful effect of \nunemployment on life satisfaction is larger the stronger the prevailing norm toward work is. (...)<p>There is additional evidence in support of the importance of social norms to the degree of \nlife satisfaction of people who are unemployed. A German study finds that unemployed \npeople report a substantial increase in life satisfaction when they retire, although other life \ncircumstances remain largely unchanged [10]. The study interprets retirement as a switch in \nthe social group with which one identifies, from the working-age population to retirees, and \nthus to a change in the social work norm. Once an individual has retired, not working no \nlonger violates the social work norm, and life satisfaction consequently increases. (...)<p>The potential felt scarcities and worries associated with unemployment are manifold. They \ninclude fewer social contacts, less social recognition, less money, a less structured day, less \ncontrol of one’s life, and less certainty about what the future will bring. Indeed, although the \neffect on happiness of temporary income reductions during unemployment is not very large, \npeople who are unemployed worry about their future economic uncertainty.&quot;<p>--<p>I think it&#x27;s still possible that unemployeds&#x27; unhappiness is caused by the work-centric culture and economy. Being shoveled money at is problematic, because you&#x27;re getting for free what society expects you to get by work. Consider the ultimate welfare we all get - sunlight, breathable air. No one feels inadequate or sad because they&#x27;re receiving it for free. It&#x27;s part of the environment. We assume air and sun are always there, will always be there, and are available to everyone without having to work for it. I think food and shelter are things we should actually try and push to the environmental level, i.e. have it available for free and to everyone, unconditionally.",1449274032

I think it&#x27;s unnecessary and maybe even unwise to support it, especially for a security-critical application.",1449273724

I don&#x27;t have issues with the awkwardness of telling people I&#x27;m not drinking if we&#x27;re in a group and people are drinking, but it sure is annoying if you&#x27;re hanging out with just one other person at night when coffee isn&#x27;t really an option. Hardest part was the fact that I like me some craft cocktails. I kind of wish there were more tea places open late.<p>Don&#x27;t really want to give up coffee though.",1449273630

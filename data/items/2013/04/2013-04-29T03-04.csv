The other times, you have to pull out A-level work. It's not 24x7, but when the time comes you have to be able to do it, eg writing a parser for an obscure query language that will get executed $X billion times per day, so it better be small, correct, and fast.<p>We ask people to prep because we want to know if you can do that level of work.",1367207986
5623991,comment,5623663,5623958,1,0,jiggy2011,,,"In that case, it's probably most space efficient to place each new window next to an already visible window or at an edge of the screen.<p>So keep a list of possible candidate positions. Each of these positions represents either an edge of the screen or a position directly above/below/to the left/to the right of an existing window. You will need to calculate different offsets for each of these circumstances to generate candidate positions. You easily eliminate ones that fall outside of the screen.<p>Each time you attempt to add a window you iterate the list of candidate positions.
If a candidate position can fit a window (just use brute force 2D AABB collision detection against all windows, or a quadtree/spatial hash to optimise) then place the window there. If it cannot fit remove the position from the candidate list.<p>Once you have added the window, calculate all the candidate positions (for each side) and add these to the list of possible positions for later windows.<p>Well it's late and that's the best I can manage..
I know somebody will point out a flaw here :)",1367207985

5623976,comment,5618112,5620117,3,0,NamTaf,,,"I've been giving this quite a bit of thought over the last few months as I've read more about agile development and trying to understand how some of its benefits could be applied to my job as a Mech Engineer.<p>I work, primarily, designing coal wagons for trains. Each wagon costs ~$200k and we have well north of 5000 almost-identical wagons of this sort in the fleet. As such, the up-front cost of design is incredible compared to developing software and changes to the design are incredibly inflexible compared to software.<p>If I want to modify something insignificant (even as small as bolting on something pre-fabricated), it takes at least 12 months to cover the entire fleet as the most minor scheduled maintenance cycle. Major modification work (e.g.: actually modifying the structure) becomes a $hundred-million, ~5 year affair.<p>A/B testing is a completely foreign concept not only because change is unwieldy but because individual wagons will not experience the exact same conditions (even if they're in the same train!). It's almost always impossible to control everything and vary only 1 condition.<p>In this and many other mechanical industries, you don't work 'agile'. You invest a lot of time and money up-front to get things right because the change cost is incredible. The whole thing is referred to as FEED [1] - Front-End Engineering Design.<p>The best analogy software guys might know is if you deploy a whole heap of disconnected embedded systems to difficult-to-reach locations. In this case, agile doesn't work. The quintessential example would be software on space systems e.g.: satellites, the shuttle, etc.<p>If you can get away with it, agile development brings a whole load of benefits. You can quickly iterate and test. You don't have to nail down your client with a specification then try to appease them when you inevitably tell them that it's too late to change stuff. Software is a great benefactor of this because duplication is literally a case of cloning software and spinning up another virtual machine. It's trivial to create a million identical copies where you can vary one specific factor and observe results over a statistically significant sample.<p>I don't think it's a case of agile being 'in vogue' rather than it being the better tool for the job of software development. Nor do I think it's a case of being 'bad' at waterfall approaches but rather spoiled by the luxuries that agile can bring - you don't truly commit to nailing down a scope exactly and sticking to it when it is common knowledge that change is so easy to execute.<p>Other industries can't afford these luxuries. Change costs heaps of time and money so you spend a great deal of pain on getting your client mentally prepared that once they press the go button, they are locked in. You have to really throw everything you have at getting it right the first time. One Kelly Johnson, of the same Skunk Works as the parent article, summed some of it up in his 14 rules of management [2] - well worth a read and note #10 in particular.<p>Unfortunately, I haven't yet really realised any great insights into how FEED-style design could benefit from lessons learned out of agile-style approaches. Maybe it's because I've not yet worked under the latter. It seems to me though that, perhaps as a result of how FEED works, it's a system that tends to attract oldschool, tried-and-true approaches rather than anything radical or new and that to me suggests that it's ripe for disruption and improvement.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_loading"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_loading</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Johnson_%28engineer%29#Kelly_Johnson.27s_14_Rules_of_Management"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Johnson_%28engineer%29#Ke...</a>",1367207551

I can't speak to Facebook, but I ask hard algorithm questions and this is why I do it.<p>The point of these hard questions is not to assess if you know some obscure algorithm. The algorithms in these questions are obscure precisely because you're not supposed to know them. If the candidate clearly knows the algorithm I switch to a new question.<p>The point of these questions is to assess your ability to perform under pressure in an unfamiliar situation, which is a fundamental skill that all productive engineers require. I expect that any engineer I greenlight to encounter novel situations. These are not necessarily Hard Problems dun dun dun, but these situations will challenge your problem solving skills and you won't be able to look up the right answer on StackOverflow. I expect candidates to have the ability to deliver a solution that works and makes the right tradeoff between time, quality, and scope.<p>I have also had interviewers ask hard problems for the wrong reasons.

Its not an Boxing match or America's got talent contest which happens once an year for which you do all the preparation for 12 months and then perform on the last hour. Software projects or any project for that matter simply don't work that way.

This algorithm thing is so badly gamed, it doesn't even make a good point of testing a candidate anymore. I've known people who work an hour everyday practicing these interview problems and can ace through such interview in a breeze, but wouldn't even last hours in a demanding work environment.<p>The best way to check if a candidate is good for you is to do a through check on the quality and kind of projects/problems they have worked on in the past.

Another would simply be to accept that the web should be an append-only distributed database like Bitcoin's blockchain or like a de-duplicating filesystem in which additions depend on prior content, making censorship all or nothing (and hopefully we wouldn't throw out the baby with the bathwater).

It will certainly filter out the bad, but you may miss some very good workers who work in different ways. Facebook still seems to be totally focused on code problems, and doesn't even mention if what you've already built is important.<p>In my opinion, <i>stuff that someone has made</i> should probably be considered the most important thing by miles. It doesn't have to be open-source code, but that certainly helps.<p>Second most important is communication skills, especially how well they can explain things they have worked on.<p>From this post, Facebook seems more interested in making sure developer can re-re-re-implement merge-bubble sort-reduce, I'm sure while occasionally printing ""Buzz"". I understand why these tests can be necessary for a lot of people[1], but I imagine the caliber of people that get past screening at Facebook aren't of that type.<p>~~~<p>The most delightful interview I ever had (I was being interviewed) was one where the development team didn't even ask me any general programming questions. They took what I had written as fulfilling that pass, and went straight into several conversations with different developers about the ways we go about making libraries. They asked me to talk about decision making process and how I might explain or advocate for various concepts. I'd like to think if they had any suspicions they might have switched gears to a FizzBuzz level, but I can't know for sure.<p>These talks got very in depth, and whiteboard-writing was had, but at no time did they ask a programming question that wasn't rooted in the concrete. It was always directed: <i>""How did you...?"" ""How might we...?"" ""Didn't you run into problems with...?""</i><p>Never did they ask me to implement a common algorithm, which feels silly. I can't remember all of them (or even most of them), and if I needed to in the course of my work I'd consult Professor Wikipedia long before I touch my own corruptible memory. Never did they ask me to implement an obscure algorithm, which popular companies seem to enjoy but I imagine filters out a lot of good candidates who happen to have spent time knowing the wrong things. I do not understand why obscura in itself might impress.<p>Instead, they had me <i>make worthwhile claims</i> about (my or other's) code and then <i>prove them.</i><p>Then they showed me what each of them was working on, ensuring there was two-way discussion on each. They showed me problems they were having, what they were doing, and asked my opinion. They showed me bugs, and we sat down and set breakpoints, talked it over and stepped through until the issue was resolved.<p>This process lasted two days, and the entire time I was <i>delighted.</i> They did an incredible job of making me feel accepted as a fellow professional developer. I ended up not taking the job for personal reasons, but the entire process and people involved were all wonderful.<p>(The company was Sencha).<p>[1] Jeff Atwood's ""Why Can't Programmers..

The reason I like this is because code uses mostly lowercase letters (unless you write COBOL), and if you keep the x height classically aligned, the font ends up looking squat and gnarly, like Akkurat.<p>Deja exaggerates the x height by (in display terms, at the point size that I use) two pixels, which evens it out and ""fills out"" the line height more nicely, making for a more harmonic flow, even though this also means the middle strokes of some capital letters don't line up with the tops of the lowercase letters.

Don't make a bunch of promises you have to work crazy hours to keep.<p>The majority of our most successful engineers have a very good work-life balance.",1367205294

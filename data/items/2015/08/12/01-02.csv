10045587,comment,10044014,10045528,0,0,orionblastar,,,"Well getting off of disability and finding an employer that can work with your mental illness and accommodate you is like the hardest thing in the world. Many managers see mental illness as a personal weakness instead of an illness that needs treatment and support.<p>That is what happened at my workplace my mental illness was seen as a weakness and they tried to weed me out by picking on, bullying, and harassing me until I left the company. I had a panic attack one day and they discovered I was mentally ill. I couldn&#x27;t quit because it was hard to find work at the time, and I have a wife and son and house payments.<p>Someone who threatens violence most likely won&#x27;t end up on disability but will do things to end up in jail and await a trial. Threatening violence is threaten with intent to terrorize and a class C felony in some areas. If he does it again and the police are called, he&#x27;d face about a year in jail and mental hospitals as they try to figure out if he is fit to stand trial. If found guilty he&#x27;d spend 3 to 10 years in jail and have one strike against him in the felony section.",1439344764

It might be a good idea, and I do think you&#x27;re also undervaluing non-code contributions, but that&#x27;s not at all the kind of &quot;welcoming&quot; I&#x27;m talking about here.<p>For the people who <i>do</i> know how to code, there&#x27;s an additional barrier of dealing with people who (for a few examples) like to shout about how anyone who could possibly write such terrible code should die to save <i>important</i> people the trouble of dealing with them, or who talk about &quot;how to explain to your wife or girlfriend&quot;, or who give conference presentations featuring lingerie models and pornstars.  Nobody should have to put up with that, or should be told to grow a thicker skin.  Not wanting to put up with that does <i>not</i> mean someone doesn&#x27;t know how to code.

How do you know if they&#x27;re &quot;broadly held&quot;, particularly among that religion&#x27;s scholars?  (You brought up &quot;unerring divine origin of scripture&quot;, which is a common belief of Fundamentalist Christians; do you know how broadly that belief is held by non-Fundamentalists?  Do you know what the other common views are among the more populous Christian and Jewish sects regarding the same scriptures?  Are you aware that Mormons believe the Bible has been corrupted?)<p>> <i>&quot;any claim that is believed by a good number of the sect&#x27;s adherents is an essential claim, as refuting it invalidates those particular adherents&#x27; beliefs&quot;</i><p>In practice, it doesn&#x27;t work that way.  Every religion I&#x27;ve studied carefully has a lot of inessential beliefs which are nonetheless widely held -- beliefs which, if they were overturned, would not in any way shake the faith of that religion&#x27;s adherents.<p>It&#x27;s common for outsiders to misidentify how popular certain beliefs are, how strongly they are held, and how essential they are.  It&#x27;s also common for outsiders to believe they&#x27;ve refuted something, when in reality they&#x27;ve stated some fact that has been known and accepted for centuries and which is actually the tip of the iceberg for scholarly study within a given religion.<p>That&#x27;s why I suggest that, if you haven&#x27;t heard of some of the specifics I named above, you&#x27;re probably not capable of actually refuting those religions.  It&#x27;s not that those things are critical, so much as that to identify and address the actual core beliefs in relevant ways requires a depth of knowledge which would also expose you to topics like the Didache, the Seer Stone, or the Midrash.  (And I wouldn&#x27;t dream of making any sort of claim about the refutability of &quot;all&quot; African tribal religions, or &quot;all&quot; eastern religions, because I don&#x27;t have that sort of depth of knowledge.  I can say that I don&#x27;t presently believe any of them, but that&#x27;s a much weaker claim than &quot;they&#x27;re all irrational and a disease&quot;.)<p>> <i>&quot;The burden of proof should be ... to demonstrate that they ... accurately describing reality&quot;</i><p>This ties us back to my original contribution to this discussion.  How does one demonstrate that their position accurately describes reality, to an audience that thinks they are &quot;motivated solely by stupidity&quot;?  How does one demonstrate there is value to be found in their belief system to someone who issues blanket dismissals?  How does either party get value out of a conversation if one of them believes it&#x27;s a monologue -- an opportunity to tell their stupid opponent how wrong they are, with no expectation that they might learn something?<p>If you begin with the assumption that someone else is stupid and you don&#x27;t need to listen carefully to them, whether you&#x27;re talking about their religion or politics or software, then it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;ll go through the sort of critical thinking process the original article described (and likely you&#x27;ll &quot;get lazy about challenging your own assumptions&quot;.)",1439344032

It has taken me many years to learn how react appropriately, so I also would welcome some kind of education.  As mental health disorders affect a significant portion of the population, perhaps it should be done as part of school.  But even then, a lack on understanding mixed with fear can still cause people to act/react badly.<p>One thing that worries me is that mental health issues can truly incapacitate people.  For the person in the article, presumably returning to any kind of work will be extremely difficult.  Who will take a chance to hire that person?  What is he to do?  If the state looks after such a person, how many healthy people will feel frustrated that somebody issues death threats and is &quot;rewarded&quot; by receiving care from the state.<p>It is a highly difficult situation.

For instance at Columbia, we have tracks in AI, Applications, Theory/Security (forget the exact name but this is theory & algorithmic heavy), Systems, etc. These tracks comprise several senior / master / phd level courses which you usually take in your last year or two. No matter which track you go into, all CS majors take the same core CS classes in data structures, basic CS/compiler/language theory, statistics, linear algebra, etc.<p>I can&#x27;t say that any of the core classes involve navigating a huge codebase... there are certainly some upper level track classes (especially in Systems) that give you that experience, but I do agree that is relatively uncommon.<p>Honestly so much of the learning happens in extracurriculars (Hackathons, CS/tech clubs, etc) that it&#x27;s hard to keep track of which skills you learn in classes vs just doing other activities with friends.

As you mention, particle filters cannot achieve this.<p>It&#x27;s a rough heuristic that to achieve a certain accuracy for a linear/Gaussian system with a particle filter, you need a number of particles exponential in the number of dimensions of the system. I feel like this could probably be stated more formally and shown, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen anything in that vein. The Kalman filter, being simply matrix operations, should scale as the number of dimensions cubed.<p>So yes, Kalman filtering is computationally more efficient, and (obviously) more accurate.<p>I also wouldn&#x27;t discount the fact that the Kalman filter is, in a sense, simpler than the particle filter for a linear/Gaussian system; you don&#x27;t need to worry about resampling or setting a good number of particles, and you don&#x27;t need to compute estimates of the mean/covariance statistics (which are sufficient since the posterior should be a Gaussian).",1439342327

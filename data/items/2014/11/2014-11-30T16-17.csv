Find all references is not faster for me in most real life scenarios. Typing grep command is just arrow up, ctrl-something to get the cursor to right position, type something, hit enter. Piped to less, I hit / to search within the results. Done right, results from grep appear pretty much instantly, no waiting. Some operating systems are much better for this technique than others, due to cost of dealing with small files.<p>> You said mutable state makes it harder to understand, and you said exceptions make it harder to understand because they&#x27;re hidden gotos (which if statements and while loops are too), but didn&#x27;t explain either. In my experience, exceptions have been a very simple, helpful, intuitive component of control flow.<p>Whenever you call some method (or overloaded operator), it can throw. The fact is completely hidden from the context in front of you in C++.<p>In Java, you do know what might throw, because you have to declare it. On the other hand, the cost is high when anything you call changes the exceptions it throws. Or more like, it&#x27;s set in stone.",1417366681

I&#x27;m sure those systems exist and I&#x27;m sure that they&#x27;re horrible. But, y&#x27;know, it&#x27;s just awfully nice to have an easy way to define structures and functions that operate on them, and the ability to use some structures interchangeably with other, related ones.<p>Objects or Haskell-like records, I&#x27;m happy with either.

8677244,comment,8676872,8677159,0,0,Ixiaus,,,"He means pattern matching functions, which are idiomatic in Erlang but &quot;dirty&quot; in Haskell (where you would want to solve it better with a type class, or something else more general).<p><i>Erlang</i><p><pre><code>    myfun({duck, &quot;My Duck&#x27;s Name&quot;}) ->
        dosomething;
    myfun({dog,  &quot;My Dog&#x27;s Name&quot;})  ->
        dosomething;
    myfun({cat,  &quot;My Cat&#x27;s Name&quot;})  ->
        dosomething.
</code></pre>
Erlang also has arity matching (this function is different than the one above it):<p><pre><code>    myfun({cat,  &quot;My Cat&#x27;s Name&quot;}, cage) ->
        dosomething. 
</code></pre>
Case statements are one way of doing that but those are considered a messy style in Erlang because they end up nesting so deeply - keeping it all out in small little functions and using pattern and arity matching is the &quot;right&quot; way.<p>You can do the same (except for arity matching) in Haskell with function arg pattern matching and Haskell also has some very nice <i>projection</i> tools for it too:<p><i>Haskell</i><p><pre><code>    newtype Name = Name { unwrapName :: String }
    data Animal = Cat | Dog | Duck deriving (Eq, Show, Ord)

    myfun :: Maybe Animal -> Name -> String
    myfun (Just a) (unwrapName -> name) = (show a) ++ &quot;&#x27;s name is: &quot; ++ name
    myfun Nothing _                     = &quot;No animal given!&quot;

    > let n = Name &quot;Fido&quot;
    > myfun (Maybe Cat) n
    > &quot;Cat&#x27;s name is: Fido&quot;
    >
    > myfun Nothing n
    > &quot;No animal given!&quot;
</code></pre>
There are many problems with that function and I could probably eliminate the multiple function clauses and reduce it to one clause by getting rid of the pattern matching and using the <i>maybe</i> function:<p><pre><code>    myfun :: Maybe Animal -> Name -> String
    myfun a (unwrapName -> n) = maybe default formatAnimal a
      where
        default = &quot;No animal given!&quot;
        formatAnimal t = printf &quot;%s&#x27;s name is: %s&quot; (show t) n
</code></pre>
That would be the more idiomatic way I would do it - pattern matching isn&#x27;t &quot;bad&quot; in Haskell and you&#x27;ll see it used quite often in utilities and libraries. It&#x27;s considered good form to move stuff like that into a utility and give it a clear name (like the <i>maybe</i> function above that takes our <i>formatAnimal</i> function) then use that in your application code so it becomes obvious what&#x27;s going on.<p>Pattern matching, deeply nested ifs and cases, etc... are somewhat hard to parse for the eye.",1417366519

I&#x27;m currently on the lookout for a new job. I studied CS and finished my PhD a year roughly a year ago. Since then I have been working in the same institute and things are getting worse by the hour.<p>My first plan was to try self-employment and startup stuff but this hasn&#x27;t worked out as planned for various reasons. In general my interests include the infrastructure level of &quot;things&quot;, e.g. OS, libraries, parallelization but also image processing, graphics et al. Probably unfortunately I can be seen more as a generalist than a specialist.<p>I looked through a lot of job offerings in my vicinity but the vast majority of these want mechanical or electrical engineers with programming skills. If there are offerings tailored to CS grads they are mostly (imho) buzzword-laden (i.e. App, hype.js or enVogueAsAService) and mainly want front-end or GUI devs. This is probably due to my location (Germany) where the main industrial power is still concentrated in the automotive sector and the (pure) CS sector is virtually non-existent. Granted, there may be some startups but the overall situation is dire.<p>Now, when I recently skimmed over a number of offerings in the valley and generally in the US, I immediately found jobs that were to my liking. Apparently, in the US, old-school CS guys are still being wanted. Of course my whole evaluation is very much biased by my interpretation of &#x27;interesting&#x27; but when cross-comparing jobs in my city and in the valley, the valley wins by a large margin.<p>I don&#x27;t want any personel job counsel here, but my question would rather be if you can still recommend moving to the valley nowadays? Is the job situation still great or is this a deception? Is it worth it financially? What about the house pricing/cost of living? How about the prevalence of &quot;social media guys&quot;?

The idea that &quot;identity is the platform&quot; can either be terrifying or empowering (maybe even both), but it is an idea that most people do not understand at all.<p>Today in order to get most software to work at all you need to agree to an impenetrable Terms of Service agreement and/or bargain away information and data that it is nearly impossible to understand the consequences of at the outset.<p>We do these things &quot;freely&quot;, on the one hand, but we are more often than not very naive when we strike what have become almost daily Faustian bargains.<p>What&#x27;s wrong with this picture is not simply that Google (or any other company) is unreliable or conflicted in their duties to be clear, transparent or good willed in their policies. The truth is, eve if they were, most of us aren&#x27;t paying attention.<p>More and more, because of the growth and ubiquity of the always-on Internet and the pervasiveness of computing (and sensing), we live in a world in which the environment is made up of software.<p>The paradox of also living within legal regimes that are mostly still quite naive about the realities of ubiquitous connectivity and pervasive computation is that we are constantly being forced to enter into contracts, and make covenants and agreements that are literally impossible to understand.<p>Again, the bizarro world this has created is one in which software doesn&#x27;t work unless you enter into a contract that there is every likelihood you will not even notice, let alone comprehend.<p>What to do?<p>There&#x27;s not an easy answer to that question. We need to ask more questions for a start. We need to think about and create alternatives. We need to figure out how to protect ourselves and others from abuses of power. We need to acknowledge that software has become political, whether we like it or not.",1417364662

Instead of `if (thing is Car) thing.drive() else if (thing is Boat) thing.swim()` its just thing.move().

You may decide to take up watercolors. Or waltz. Or study history.",1417363321

And after testing it on volunteers in the U.K. and maybe US (it is being tested in Bethesda by the NIH, I don&#x27;t know the timing), this particular vaccine is being tested on volunteer healthcare workers in Mali, see e.g. <a href=""http://www.citypress.co.za/news/africas-first-ebola-vaccine-trial-starts-mali/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citypress.co.za/news/africas-first-ebola-vaccine-...</a> (I think they&#x27;ve tested it on more people since that article, you no doubt want to go a bit slowly since many of the worst reactions are fairly quick).  And I think there are some other African locations scheduled.<p>Vaccines and epidemics are a pretty well understood concepts after all (ignore the &quot;public health&quot; types who are obsessed with lifestyle etc. issues to the detriment of infectious diseases, like the current head of the CDC), there&#x27;s no surprise people are attempting to Do The Right Thing with these candidate vaccines.  E.g. as I note elsewhere in this discussion, this one is in the process of being produced at an intermediate scale of 10,000 doses, which is a necessary step before true mass production.",1417363317

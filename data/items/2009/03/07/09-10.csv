I don't deny that.<p>My problem comes in when he was awarded the money that was 'gained' by actions that was against their TOS.<p>That just doesn't make any sense.",1236419284

So new ones gain market share by being the choice of <i>new</i> projects, which then gradually displace old projects in the marketplace.  This takes basically forever: a lot of people are still using CVS.  But git's won the battle for folks creating new codebases, so it's basically inevitable at this point that people will eventually migrate over to it.",1236418806

If you let things go that way, the community becomes elitist and reactionary... Everyone should be welcome to post on this site as long as they are willing to abide by the rules: stay polite, articulate, etc.",1236418447

If you're exposing people to things they were unaware of before, then, by definition, they're going to be very early in the sales process, and the conversion rate will be abysmal.",1236417807

506393,comment,506165,506241,0,0,gruseom,,,"Wow, that reminds me of a lesson in humility I got once. I was doing math undergrad. The professors used to let a few of us smart-ass types hang out in their math department lounge where the order of the day was playing chess and Go, exchanging attempts at witticism, and avoiding work. One day I noticed a stranger, a shabbily-dressed little old man, hobbling around the room. I distinctly remember thinking: ""What is that old guy doing in here? He obviously doesn't belong here. He looks like a bum!""<p>It was Erd√∂s.",1236416846

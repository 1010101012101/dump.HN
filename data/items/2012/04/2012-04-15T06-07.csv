Don't act surprised at accusations of sockpuppetry.)<p>Frankly, I'm inclined to believe those other people are wrong--as I've sketched out elsewhere, there is quite obviously nothing productive here that we can discuss. We lack useful information, we lack unbiased info, and all we can do is rage for one side or the other while producing nothing other than noise.<p><i>""If someone approaches those with the know-how to help, asking for help, and are summarily told to fuck off, who then should they turn to?""</i><p>They probably should've thought of that prior to pissing off people. You know the great thing about the internet? We have the unique opportunity to deal with people on an equal (mostly) footing.<p>Your damsel in distress? ""Rachel"", or whatever his/her/its name is? They can go to the same resources we all have, they can learn about the same subjects as we have, and uniquely empower themselves with the same know-how we have.<p>Even better, they can clutter up HN with threads asking for that information, <i>without ever having to mention why they need it</i>. Isn't that great? Isn't that productive?<p>Or, you know, they can waste our collective cycles trying to find somebody else to pull into their drama vortex. Funny thing about meritocracies--if you lack merit, yeah, you are expected to fuck right off.<p>Hell, if you really want vigilante justice, go try and summon the /b/astards and goons from SA. HN is not for dumb shit like this.<p><i>""So, please, try to take a long view on this issue, even if Rachel can be kind of a drama queen.""</i><p>Don't insult us by trying to conflate internet policy with what can help out your friend (?).<p>The long view is that every time we get others involved in petty drama, we waste their time. Every time we stoop to engage with people who clearly get off on trolling us, we encourage them.<p>The internet is an anarchy, yes, and that's what's so great about it. And you know what? Maybe Rachel should consider taking a breather, or not replying to trolls, or maybe just trying to get along and be a friendly person regardless of some people being dicks.",1334473066

The ""!"" is there for its proper purpose, as a ""unary not"" operation, which will short circuit the second operand of the ""&&"" when isActive is false.<p>Given that, @fat has left out a semicolon in a way that is perfectly legitimate based on this language specification, at least as described in the 5.1 version linked from here: <a href=""http://inimino.org/~inimino/blog/javascript_semicolons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inimino.org/~inimino/blog/javascript_semicolons</a>).<p>Could @fat have written the code differently so that he would have been required to include the "";""? Perhaps -- but I don't see why that counterfactual has any particular bearing here.<p>Crockford's own page on JSMin <<a href=""http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html&#62"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html&#62</a>; claims: ""JSMin is a filter that omits or modifies some characters. This does not change the behavior of the program that it is minifying.""<p>The fact is that @fat's code is legal code and JSMin is breaking it.<p>IMHO, Crockford is ignoring the technical matters at hand. @fat cannot be faulted for writing code that complies with the specification and for having a reasonable expectation that code minimizers will preserve the semantics of his legal code. Crockford (and others) may wish that the language specification did not include automatic semicolon insertion because it does hamper making changes in the language without breaking existing code -- but that does not make this piece of code ""insanely stupid"".<p>Yes, forward progress on the language would be better served if automatic semicolon insertion rules weren't in the specification. However, calling one particular piece of code that leverages those rules ""insanely stupid"" and refusing to acknowledge that JSMin is in fact breaking the semantics of the code is not productive. Refusing to fix this in JSMin does not somehow make the problem with the specification to go away.",1334471944

The parent claimed that Valve and Google's work environment were the same (at Google's early onset) and wondered why ""Google's ended up blowing up"".  My answer to that question is that Valve was able to keep the culture they have because they kept the company size small, and Google was unable to sustain that culture because they exploded in size.  If Valve were to start hiring like crazy (as Google did), you'll see the same thing happen.

The situations where you <i>don't</i> end a line with a semi-colon are more numerous than the rules you need to write semi-colon-free code. Besides, if it's so simple, why not leave it to the interpreter?",1334470294

3842955,comment,3842923,3842923,10,0,barrkel,,,"I'm uninterested in any specifics, actually; I'm more interested in how much of the syntax landscape is cut off for future extension, particularly at the expression level.<p>It's one thing to insert semicolons in this case:<p><pre><code>  <ident> <op> <ident> <op> <ident>
  <keyword>
</code></pre>
and another to do so in this kind of case:<p><pre><code>  <ident> <op> <ident>
  <op> <ident>
</code></pre>
The former is unlikely to be problematic for future extension, but the latter more so. The general pattern in Algol-derived languages is for all statements (except for expressions, including assignments and procedure calls) to begin with a keyword. This substantially reduces ambiguity - semicolons are mostly redundant in this situation - and it seems to me to be a fine place in JS to automatically insert them.<p>Another distinctive feature of Algol-derived languages is that two adjacent expressions are generally not meaningful; for example, <ident> <ident> is not usually a valid expression sequence in Pascal, C, etc. (and in the presence of typedefs, it is actually a concrete problem when trying to parse C declarations, often requiring communication between lexer and parser to turn typedef identifiers into keywords for the purpose of parsing[1]). This in turn creates freedom for creating new keywords unambiguously, by including whitespace in the ""keyword"" (actually two words). But JS foregoes some of this, because <ident> \n <ident> will have a semicolon inserted on the line break. It's not too bad though, because new two-word ""keywords"" are not usually broken over two lines; but long expressions almost always extend over multiple lines at some point.<p>Do you see what I'm getting at here?<p>[1] <a href=""http://calculist.blogspot.co.uk/2009/02/c-typedef-parsing-problem.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://calculist.blogspot.co.uk/2009/02/c-typedef-parsing-pr...</a> has what seems to be a reasonable overview of this problem.",1334470207

But shorter travel distances may also be a factor.<p>On a related note: alcohol laws may also make a big difference. Europeans have pretty much grown out of the ""awesome, I can drink legally now"" phase by the time they hit 25, Americans in that age group tend to have a slightly immature alcohol culture.",1334470151

We can&#x27;t have a political discussion about that subroutines memory leak, or how to fix it.  Perhaps its not possible to have a rational discussion about an irrational lifestyle subject, aka a political topic.

9521482,comment,9519975,9519975,0,0,A_COMPUTER,,,"On a metaphysical level I think Grant Morrison touched on conventional counterculture in The Invisibles. Counterculture is just another, essential part of The System expressing itself. Things happen because of The system you&#x27;re inside The System, and your &quot;individualism&quot; is an emergent property of it. The example I think he used was the police. Was there ever a year when nobody decided to become a police officer? If society was made up of free people making free choices, there would always be catastrophic upsets like this, but it doesn&#x27;t ever happen. So to that extent, I think the article is incorrect because while you may feel more &quot;authentically counterculture&quot; the further away you are from &quot;conventional counterculture&quot;, you&#x27;re still just a slightly rarer perturbation in the tank.<p>Your counterculture is only useful if it combats or shields you from a dominant paradigm that is offensive to your values, and if you&#x27;re alone in the suburbs being hardcore, you&#x27;re probably losing. Unless your real goal is to feel cool, I guess, then by its own standards yes you are more counterculture than &quot;counterculture&quot;. Establishment countercultures may be hypocrites because they don&#x27;t recognize they&#x27;re establishment, but they may also be creating systems that ultimately comfort the people in them. But it&#x27;s probably not sustainable because your primary definition for a culture cannot be one of contrast to something else. America is a nation that has was born in and has internalized rebellion. This is probably the worst value we have, because you can&#x27;t actually build on that for very long, it&#x27;s &quot;meant&quot; for the tearing down phase of a bloated bureaucracy. As a nation gets settled if it doesn&#x27;t abandon that value it will start turning inward and attacking itself, which I think is exactly what is happening.<p>Did I read too much into this essay?",1431294564

9521471,comment,9519904,9520967,0,0,zachrose,,,"There&#x27;s a whole depth of abstractions that people imply when they talk about OOP in JavaScript. In my mind they go something like this.<p><pre><code>    1) Using object literals for values.
    2) Using object literals with functions.
    3) Using object literals with functions and calling them in contexts (`this`, `bind`, `apply`).
    4) Using the `new` keyword.
    5) Designing objects with inheritance hierarchies or prototype chains.
    6) Designing mutable and stateful objects with indefinite life spans.

I don&#x27;t understand the arguments that classical-ish inheritance in JS is bad while prototypical inheritance is somehow better.

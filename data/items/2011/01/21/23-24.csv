Their stock price (and therefore, as an investor, your equity value) will largely move with the markets. You don't buy them for out-performing equity growth or a liquidity event, but rather for the regular profits they share as dividends. FWIW, I think Microsoft has an option to become one of these companies, instead of chasing rapid shareprice growth.<p>The comparison is buying for equity, where you hope to buy low and sell high. Dividends aren't a priority - and since they often amount to cents per share and you're chasing share price growth measured in multiples, dividends are almost irrelevant to your success measurements.<p>As you point out with Google, their share price could already be considered high. I don't know what their dividend plans are for the future, but that (plus growth more in line with the market, maybe a little ahead) is a ""tangible value"" of holding their shares.<p>jwegan - I know I've probably oversimplified that for you since you have familiarity, but I thought it worth spelling out for other HN readers with less awareness / experience.

You want to build a custom firmware for your phone just <i>because</i>. Eventually, you master those skills, and you move on - you move into industry, or you move into an area of expertise in which you don't want to have to worry about whether you've got enough cooling on your overclocked GPU.<p>The point is - apple make some of the best <i>tools</i> out there. The iPhone just works. Sure, you can't run custom, unvetted code on there, but the code you can run on it does what it says on the can and does it damned well. Sure, upgrading a mac is a pain in the jacksie, but those elements which you'd reasonably want to upgrade within the lifecycle, you can, easily. As for reliability? In the organisation I run, we have a 50/50-ish split between commodity hardware (think dell) and apple machines. The overall failure rate is roughly even between the two, and given that all of the macs are laptops, I think it's a fair cop.<p>Summary: apple make tools. They make tools which work for everybody from total noobs to über-leets. Plenty of people don't get this. One day they will. Therefore this doesn't matter.",1295651847

While the reasoning behind keeping software ecosystems and physical hardware closed is actually good—keeping out the well-meaning but poorly-trained developers and amateur tinkerers who want to ""repair"" or ""upgrade"" your hardware, not to mention enforcing the consistent user experience as mentioned in the article—those practices also have other effects which are troubling in the long-term, which is what a lot of ""techies"" object to.<p>I am not in Apple's market, so their practices don't affect me directly as a user. However, their practices do affect me in that having one of the largest, most successful companies in the world engage in what I see as problematic practices tells other companies that it's a good, or at least tenable, idea. In the future, a fledgling company could see a choice between the Pro-Consumer But Difficult path and the Closed Everything But Simple path, and think, ""Well, Apple did it, so I guess if we do it, it's okay."" And that's why I find Apple troubling.",1295651823
2129304,comment,2127722,2127884,0,0,misterbwong,,,"It was a pretty useful video for some basics on jQuery performance<p>Here are my notes for those that don't want to watch.  Apologies for typos/inaccuracies/weird formatting:<p><i>Why performance?</i><p>1. you want apps to be snappy(duh)<p>2. more work = more memory = slower apps<p><i>Tip 1 Stay up to date of jQuery core.</i><p>Each update usually brings performance updates<p>ex: 1.5 bringing a complete rewrite of the ajax module<p><i>Tip 2 Know your selectors. All selectors not created equal</i><p>Fastest to slowest: ID selectors -> Element selectors -> Class Selectors -> Pseudo selectors<p>Why?  ID and element selectors are backed by native DOM operations.<p>Pseudo has no browser based call.  So if you're using :hidden, you are running the ""find :hidden function"" on every element in your select space.<p>Parents & children - Sizzle matches selectors right to left.<p>Slower example:<p><pre><code>  $(""#parent > .child"").show(); \n</code></pre>\nThis code will find all .child elements before looking to see if it's a child of #parent<p>Faster example:<p><pre><code>  $parent.children("".child"").show(); \n</code></pre>\nThis code would be faster but keep in mind it only finds direct children of $parent<p><i>Tip 3 Caching = Win</i><p>Example:<p><pre><code>  var parents = $('.parents'); //cache parents\n</code></pre>\nBad:<p><pre><code>  var children = $('.parents').find('.child'); //this one does a find over the entire dom again\n</code></pre>\nGood:<p><pre><code>  parents.find('.child');  //this one just searches through the parents obj\n</code></pre>\n<i>Tip 3.5 Bonus</i><p>Avoid global variables (they're slow, cause conflicts, etc)<p><i>Tip 4 Use Chaining</i><p>Why? Less code, easier to write, runs fast<p>Almost all jQuery methods return a jQuery object, which allow chaining<p>Do this:<p><pre><code>  var parents = $('.parents').doSomething().doSomethingElse();\n</code></pre>\nDon't do:<p><pre><code>  var parents = $(.parents').doSomething(); \n  var parents = $('.parents').doSomethingElse();\n</code></pre>\nAnother example:<p><pre><code>  //Without chaining (finds #notification 3 times)\n  $('#notification').fadeIn('slow');\n  $('#notification').addClass('.activeNotification');\n  $('#notification').css('margin-left', '50px');\n\n  //with chaining (finds #notification once)\n  $('#notification').fadeIn('slow')\n                    .addClass('.activeNotification')\n                    .css('margin-left', '50px');\n</code></pre>\n<i>Tip 4.5 Bonus</i><p>Use indentation to make it more readable<p><i>Tip 5 Event Delegation</i><p>Know the difference between 3 Types of event handling: .bind(), .live(), .delegate()<p><pre><code>  .bind()\n</code></pre>\nsimplest form of attaching function to some event (click, etc)<p>works best with small sets of data.  can take time to bind() to lots of elements<p>does not handle dynamic data (e.g. newly created elements, etc)<p>.bind() to table rows might not be that great<p>browser needs to keep track of them<p>instead, use event delgation (.live() or .delegate())on the table and let the event bubble up<p><pre><code>  .live()\n</code></pre>\nsimplest way to do event delegation<p>best used for simple scenarios<p>functions best with supplied selector<p>not chainable<p>works with dynamic data<p><pre><code>  .delegate()\n</code></pre>\nsubtle diff between live and delegate<p>more focused way of doing event delegates (?)<p><i>Tip 6 The DOM isn't a database</i><p>Every DOM insertion (e.g. appending an image to the document) is costly<p>Minimize by building Htmlstrings and using a single append() as late as possible<p>Use detach() if doing heavy iteration with a node then re-insert when done<p><i>Tip 6.5 Attaching data</i><p>Common way:<p><pre><code>  //convenience method that incurs overhead\n  $('#item').data(key, value)\n</code></pre>\nFaster way:<p><pre><code>  //significantly faster bc it's a low level method\n  $.data('#item', key, value);\n</code></pre>\n<i>Tip 7: Avoid Loops.  Nested DOM selectors can perform better</i><p>If it's possible avoid loops and use selector engine instead.<p>Slow way:<p><pre><code>  $('#menu a.submenu').each(\n	function(index){\n		$(this).doSomething().doSomethingElse();\n  });\n</code></pre>\nBetter way (if possible):<p><pre><code>  $('#menu a.submenu').doSomething().doSomethingElse();\n</code></pre>\nThere are places when loops can't be avoided.  That's OK.  Selector is faster if you can use it, however.<p><i>Tip 8: Keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)</i><p><i>Tip 9: When in doubt, perf test</i><p>jsPerf.com - Easy way to compare perf on js snippets<p>uses benchmark.js - a neat benchmarking utility that works cross-platform<p>easy to share code or modify other tests<p>also useful as a js knowledge base",1295651791

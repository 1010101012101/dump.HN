You may claim that users give them the data &quot;willingly&quot;, but the fact is that facebook collects users data even before their users have an account there. Management of the settings around privacy are also practically impossible. Facebook also ran into privacy snafus countless times.",1394783985

Why do I need to waste time inputting this information online, and then look it up or check emails? Wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense to just check the package when I have the fridge open?<p>Things without expiration dates, like fruit and veggies don&#x27;t follow a particular timeline. They might be bad in 2 days, or 2 weeks. That means they can&#x27;t be used with this application either, since they go bad when they look bad.<p>But, what about frozen dinners or something that I prepare, and freeze for the future? Well, I&#x27;ll just write the date on them, when I stick them in the freezer.<p>Congrats on the experiment, but I&#x27;m going to be a little harsh on the concept and say it should be renamed to wastetime.io. This looks like a huge time sink by inputting everything I buy, and then removing everything I use. Apps are suppose to achieve the opposite, they should save me time.",1394783922

It would be like flipping a coin and seeing heads, then claiming that this outcome increases the probability that heads will be the preferred outcome in future tosses, or tosses in general. Think about what you&#x27;re saying.<p>> Take the other extreme - you look at the 1000 most recent lottery winners, and discover that they&#x27;re all named Ralph. You look at the names of people buying lottery tickets, and Ralph only shows up 1% of the time. You&#x27;re not going to consider it any more likely that the next winner will be named Ralph as well?<p>Not without an explanation that can be tested and potentially falsified -- the gold standard of science. Without an explanation, it&#x27;s a coincidence.<p>Try to remember that science is not simply drawing conclusions on the basis of observations -- there&#x27;s more to it than that. It&#x27;s not science until an explanation (a theory) is proposed, is tested, and has resisted falsification.<p>What if I told you that someone correctly predicted the direction of the stock market for 20 months straight, all in advance? Does that prove he&#x27;s a stock market genius? Here&#x27;s a better explanation, one that a scientist would want to test first -- if 1,048,576 (i.e. 2^20) people try to predict the stock market&#x27;s direction for 20 months straight by flipping coins, <i>there is a better than even chance that one of them will succeed by chance alone</i>.<p>Next question -- what&#x27;s the chance that the one random winner will assume that his success resulted from chance, or will he start selling a worthless book called &quot;Secrets of the Winners&quot; on late-night TV?",1394783793

However, the banning system is IP based, so along with it all the site would have been blocked.

7397343,comment,7396113,7396738,5,0,arg01,,,"Generally being a sole infrastructure provider is a very secure investment. This is because you can overcharge until a competitor enters the market and then when competition appears you can undercut them as you no longer need to recoup capital costs while your competitor does. This can stop competitors entering the market as there is not an incentive to do so.<p>There are a couple of factors that make this a reasonable investment for Google even though they&#x27;re not the incumbent. The first is the old infrastructure is old enough that it is not capable of offering the same service as the new infrastructure without a significant amount of extra capital investment. Google also can cancel out some of what would be normal capital costs associated with a new entrant because they have related in house skills/services and the clout to bypass some regulatory capture.<p>This means that the incumbents lose a lot of their advantages as they&#x27;re playing catch up too and they have to work-in legacy systems. They can&#x27;t offer the same service on their old infrastructure and have to offer a lower price  until they can. To make matters worse they don&#x27;t want to be too obvious in what they can offer as they could be stung by the state in other places if they act in a way that shows they are consistently abusing their monopoly or acting anti competitively.<p>It&#x27;s probably true that Google&#x27;s investment is set to make money but I&#x27;d guess once you factor in opportunity cost it&#x27;s not the smartest investment. But consider the other advantage they have is that they&#x27;re not working in a vacuum, improvements in internet usage improves their core business, so even if they get out competed in this market it can help their overall bottom line.",1394780991

A couple of times, I flew on business trips with him, and we sat in different parts of the plane. Both times, I would get up to walk around the plane a bit and see him over in his seat going through some recent bestselling novel. Amazingly (to me), I would see him burning through his beach literature at an average rate of about 100 pages/hr, which would be about 600wpm, except that he took breaks. I&#x27;d guess that he read at about 700-750wpm. He wasn&#x27;t trying to impress anyone; he was just sitting by himself reading to pass the time.<p>This was astonishing to me. I read a lot more than he did and had a much richer vocabulary, yet I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to follow the story at even half that speed. I eventually asked him about it and reached the conclusion that we read in different ways. I&#x27;m bored by books like that and usually read things that I have to think about to understand. If I do read a book like his, I read a bit and drift off thinking about it, then read a bit more and drift off in thought.... He rips through it with so much speed and focus that he apparently &quot;experiences&quot; it like a movie without drifting off into analysis. The speed intensifies the experience for him; it doesn&#x27;t ruin it.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to do it but without success. I seem to be trained to chew my food, not inhale it. And he used to tease me about the things I would read for fun, apparently considering them unspeakably boring and nearly indecipherable.<p>I think there is more diversity in the action of reading than most of us imagine.",1394780758

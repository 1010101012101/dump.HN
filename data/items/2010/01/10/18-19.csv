If you have a lot of license keys to juggle or finicky software that wants a very specific install environment, it's just plain easier to use one computer. And if you have tons of media sitting on Dropbox, it can take ages to do the initial sync after a reinstall, even if you're only using the 2GB free account. And my EEE 900's flash drive doesn't play well with Dropbox and turns the whole desktop into a nightmarish stop-start experience...so it's been relegated to being almost purely a web machine.<p>But apart from those things, my cross-computer experience has been pretty good.",1263149676

But anyways, look below.<p>From <a href=""http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/crime/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/cri...</a>:<p>> Past year illicit drug users were also about 16 times more likely than nonusers to report being arrested and booked for larceny or theft; more than 14 times more likely to be arrested and booked for such offenses as driving under the influence, drunkenness, or liquor law violations; <i></i>and more than 9 times more likely to be arrested and booked on an assault charge.<i></i><p>You can look at that website for several statistics. You will note that that website shows increased offenses for drug users that are not related to traditional ""drug-trafficking"" or ""black-market"" activities (so this can’t be blamed on the prohibition of drugs).<p>> I understand the connection between the drug trade and the violent crime, pertaining to the criminal element of the black market; but the notion that I'm buying weed today, raping/murdering tomorrow, is nonsense.<p>You should make a distinction between hard and soft drugs. Claiming that weed is safe, therefore all drugs are safe isn’t correct – and it is a strawman. That website clearly states that drug-users have a significantly increased crime rate. I am not going to discuss in detail the causes of crime for drug users (which doesn’t have anything to do with any statement I made).<p>From the same website:<p>> Another dimension of drug-related crime is committing an offense to obtain money (or goods to sell to get money) to support drug use. According to the 1991 joint survey of Federal and State prison inmates, an estimated 17 percent of State prisoners and 10 percent of Federal prisoners reported committing their offense to get money to buy drugs;<p>And the conclusion:<p>> The evidence indicates that drug users are <i></i>more likely than nonusers to commit crimes<i></i>, that arrestees frequently were under the influence of a drug at the time they committed their offense, and that <i></i>drugs generate violence<i></i>.",1263147699

If light speed limits travel speeds, however, then a selection effect may eventually determine frontier behavior. Making weak assumptions about colonization technology, we use this selection effect to predict colonists' behavior, including which oases they colonize, how long they stay there, how many seeds they then launch, how fast and far those seeds fly, and how behavior changes with increasing congestion. This colonization model explains several astrophysical puzzles, predicting lone oases like ours, amid large quiet regions with vast unused resources.""<p>The point of the submitted article seems to be already mentioned in:<p>""The Great Filter - Are We Almost Past It?"" (first version August 1996) (<a href=""http://hanson.gmu.edu/greatfilter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hanson.gmu.edu/greatfilter.html</a>)<p>""Humanity seems to have a bright future, i.e., a non-trivial chance of expanding to fill the universe with lasting life. But the fact that space near us seems dead now tells us that any given piece of dead matter faces an astronomically low chance of begating such a future. There thus exists a great filter between death and expanding lasting life, and humanity faces the ominous question: how far along this filter are we?<p>Combining standard stories of biologists, astronomers, physicists, and social scientists would lead us to expect a much smaller filter than we observe. Thus one of these stories must be wrong. To find out who is wrong, and to inform our choices, we should study and reconsider all these areas. In particular we should seek evidence of extraterrestrials, such as via radio signals, Mars fossils, or dark matter astronomy. But contrary to common expectations, evidence of extraterrestrials is likely bad (though valuable) news. The easier it was for life to evolve to our stage, the bleaker our future chances probably are.""<p>Both links are from the collection `The Economics of Science Fiction' (<a href=""http://hanson.gmu.edu/econofsf.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hanson.gmu.edu/econofsf.html</a>)",1263147564

Neither Lisp in general nor SBCL specifically were/are that much used to form the bases of high profile websites.<p>> I know of several other large corporate projects over the years that made similar switches for similar reasons.<p>I&#x27;ve seen lots of large corporations rewriting all kinds of software.

Plus, as I said above, in many companies &#x27;powerful&#x27; and &#x27;flexible&#x27; is not the most important criteria when selecting languages and tools. Java got successful because of other qualities: being developed by SUN (then Google and IBM) for enterprise software development.<p>&#x27;GNU CL&#x27; was never a GNU project as such. GNU CL based on KCL/AKCL and has been used in a few applications.

9560645,comment,9559731,9559731,0,0,pvnick,,,"This is an important article. Dialectical behavior therapy and other mindfulness-based treatments are rapidly becoming go-to therapeutic methods. While I wasn&#x27;t depressed or suicidal, about two months ago I started DBT training through a book [1], but used another audio book for mindfulness training [2]. The results have been fairly profound.<p>The key is &quot;radical acceptance&quot;. The universe is perfect <i>in this moment</i>, even if there are things you don&#x27;t particularly like. You are a worthy and lovable person <i>in this moment</i>, even as there are certain aspects of yourself that you are currently trying to change. That&#x27;s the dialectical part of dialectical behavior therapy. The idea of radical acceptance is something that can be applied right now, even before learning the skills.<p>The author talks about shame. Shame convinces us that we are broken, that we aren&#x27;t good enough. It tends to get passed through generations due to the way we are raised and the way we raise our children. Treating that shame is very effective for convincing us that we are, in fact, good enough. A book called Taming Your Outer Child [3], accompanied by meditations developed by John Bradshaw meant to get one in touch with one&#x27;s inner child [4], are both very powerful for healing that shame.<p>Finally, I can&#x27;t help but add a TED talk by Brene Brown called the Power of Vulnerability [5]. In it she describes the idea of feeling worthy and &quot;enough,&quot; and how it is key to happiness and living a fulfilled life. For me, it was helpful because it gave me a concrete idea to work towards.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Dialectical-Behavior-Therapy-Skills-Workbook/dp/1572245131"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Dialectical-Behavior-Therapy-Skills-Wo...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mindfulness-Eight-Week-Finding-Peace-Frantic-ebook/dp/B005NJ2T1G"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mindfulness-Eight-Week-Finding-Peace...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Taming-Your-Outer-Child-Self-Sabotage-ebook/dp/B00KC6FDLS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Taming-Your-Outer-Child-Self-Sabotage-...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/Home-Coming-Audiobook/B002VAET86"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/Home-Coming-Audio...</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability?language=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability?langu...</a>",1431880647

Be the novelty instrument in a alternative band? Find an orchestra or quartett that&#x27;s beginner friendly and ...cool?<p>Meanwhile, the return on a minimal investment in guitar playing and a bit of singing is almost comical. Also plenty of bands need a bass player and you&#x27;ll easily find a group of cool people to play with even if you&#x27;re just starting out and in your 50ies. Want more? Try the piano; moderate effort will enable you to play all pop/rock songs.",1431880021

9560584,comment,9558562,9559160,0,0,mdasen,,,"I think most people aren&#x27;t looking to containers for performance.  Containers offer a lot more flexibility.<p>At my work, we run containers on top of EC2.  We have a system where we can note how much RAM and CPU we want a container to have.  This gives us a couple advantages over running regular boxes on EC2.<p>First, the CPU allocations are soft.  If there&#x27;s idle CPU on a box, it can be allocated to containers that want it.  Imagine a 4-ECU box with 4 containers on it, each wanting 1-ECU.  If they&#x27;re all using the CPU equally, they each get an ECU.  However, if two of them are idle on the CPU, the other two can burst to 2-ECU.  If they were separate EC2 instances, they wouldn&#x27;t get that burst.<p>Second, what happens when you want to allocate another 2GB of RAM to a container you&#x27;ve given 14GB of RAM to?  Running containers means we can run large EC2 boxes and let an algorithm deal with the backpack problem of how to stuff things into the different EC2 instances with minimal waste.  Without containers, we need to step up to the next-sized instance which might have way more RAM than we need, leading to waste.<p>Along the same lines, we often want to leave a little overhead in the RAM for different processes.  Like, the RAM usage shouldn&#x27;t go over 10GB, but if it goes up to 11GB for a short time, we&#x27;d rather let the garbage collector do its thing than kill it.  This means leaving a little overhead.  Having this little overhead for everything adds up, but sharing it among lots of things on a large box makes it less waste and the in the unlikely even that all of them want the overhead at the same time, some get killed and re-started on different boxes.<p>Now, why use EC2 rather than physical hardware from SoftLayer or someone else?  EC2 allows us to spin up instances fast.  If someone needs 10 15GB containers launched, the EC2 instances can be provisioned in a couple minutes and the containers can be launched on them.  SoftLayer notes 20-30 minutes for one of their standard configuration physical servers which is pretty good, but a long time to wait if you&#x27;re trying to scale up for a burst of traffic or trying to batch process some data or whatnot.  If you&#x27;re looking to customize anything, SoftLayer takes 2-4 hours.<p>There are definitely cases where every last bit of performance counts (and costs money).  I&#x27;ve heard stories of Google being maniacal about finding anything that is blocking in some of their systems.  I also know a lot of people that worry about overhead that don&#x27;t even know where most of the time is spent in their own code.  I mean, if one is running a Rails app making a cross-country network call in the request tying up that process for 100ms, the overhead of Xen really isn&#x27;t an issue.  That&#x27;s an extreme example, but for most users I think the convenience and flexibility of containers is the selling point, not eliminating a tiny bit of overhead from Xen.",1431879643

While they&#x27;re useful in understanding the roots of an idea and challenging the way things are, they often aren&#x27;t practical. If everybody had to use a computer the way Stallman does, they probably wouldn&#x27;t use computers.<p>The benefit accessibility, which unfortunately often relies on non-free software, provides is of great value to many people.<p>Stallman has the privilege of an education from MIT where he learned the ins-and-outs of computing and is able to function efficiently with this knowledge. I have friends who have to work for subsistence wages who simply wouldn&#x27;t have the time nor the energy to learn everything about how to use fully free software, and they get huge benefits from using the Internet.<p>My mute brother often uses proprietary voice assistance software to speak that locks him into Apple&#x27;s platform. He doesn&#x27;t care. The benefits of him being able to communicate efficiently <i>far</i> outweigh the cost in terms of both the cost of the software and the &quot;dangers&quot; of using proprietary software. Admittedly, I&#x27;d like it if I could modify the source code, but it&#x27;s better than starting from scratch.<p>Even his stance on cell phones ignores the concerns of many people. I don&#x27;t know where Stallman lives, but I&#x27;m betting it&#x27;s a pretty safe area for him. He can live without a cell phone because the likelihood that he will need to call 911 when he&#x27;s out and about is low. Constant tracking is bad, but being assaulted is worse.<p>All that being said, I wish more software was free. It&#x27;d lead to more eyes on the software everyone is using which would probably improve it a lot in terms of functionality, security, and performance. It&#x27;s hard for one person or a small group of people to have expertise in every area that a good piece of modern software requires.",1431879610

This has at least two benefits: the compiler doesn&#x27;t have to reason about the code invariants &quot;globally&quot;, which might slow and hard to optimize, and the APIs are clearer and the user doesn&#x27;t have to know implementation details to reason about them.<p>If there&#x27;s going to be some concept of purity, according to the same principle, it&#x27;d be something that one could know just by looking at the function signatures.",1431878957

It never occurred to me that I suffered with anxiety but through a series of events I started having panic attacks and sought help.<p>I&#x27;ve since learned that anxiety is often a front for emotions that cannot be adequately expressed or processed. For me, it&#x27;s all the &quot;unhealthy&quot; emotions - anger, sadness, shame. The tools I&#x27;ve been able to deploy in anxiety fits include mindfulness: simply concentrating on my breathing and realizing how my body is reacting to stimuli. Often just meditating for a few minutes helps lower my anxiety, get my breathing under control and stop my heart from pounding.<p>There&#x27;s also journaling my emotions several times a day. I built an app that sends me an SMS asking me how I am feeling and why and logs the response for later analysis.<p>It&#x27;s not easy building new skills. It&#x27;s also not easy re-training your mind after a lifetime of negative thinking. But so far its been working, and I&#x27;ve been able to do it drug free.",1431878919

Anyone can just cherry-pick evidence that suits them, but where does that leave us?<p>Reasoning based on correct premises works pretty well though.<p>> <i>I&#x27;m sorry for assuming an economic context for my terms — elsewhere in the thread you asserted that &quot;Opposition to UBI comes from people with a clue about economics&quot; so I made the assumption that you were familiar with economic terms.</i><p>Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve seen those terms thrown around, but they&#x27;re vague and obtuse enough to be practically meaningless. That&#x27;s hardly surprising, considering their main use is rationalizing government intervention.<p>For example, no economy can ever reach &quot;pareto optimality&quot;: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_optimality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_optimality</a> .. because every single voluntary exchange leaves both participants better off, because otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t go through it. Since value is subjective, it really is enough that they both <i>perceive</i> a benefit in the trade.<p>If you want to argue against that, you&#x27;d have to somehow magically know how much I&#x27;d be willing to pay for a Ford Fiesta tomorrow at 4pm. But you can&#x27;t. No one else can. Just like I couldn&#x27;t possibly know your preferences at some given moment in time.<p>So yeah, pareto optimality is nonsense, as explained above, and so is a lot of the other stuff involved in these discussions. That&#x27;s part of why I demanded definitions.<p>> I don&#x27;t think there are many serious economists that you back you up on this assertion.<p>You&#x27;d have to look to the Austrian school of economic thought for that, but all of them would agree with me.<p>> <i>This claims that I would be happier if there were no roads, no water supply, no education systems, no protection from criminals (which technically don&#x27;t exist because there&#x27;s no criminal behavior), and no protection from other countries.</i><p>All the services you list are provided by people working for a living. Do you want to claim people need governments to tell/force them to work for a living?<p>> <i>I absolutely would like some of my money taken and spent on those thing.</i><p>No you don&#x27;t. No one <i>wants</i> to be robbed, any more than beaten to a pulp with a baseball bat. What you might be thinking is that <i>you&#x27;re willing to pay</i> for those services, but that would also apply without getting robbed.<p>> <i>At the very least arguing economics won&#x27;t get us to any common ground — I think we&#x27;d have to switch over to philosophy before we&#x27;d find common ground.</i><p>You&#x27;re right about that :)",1431878821

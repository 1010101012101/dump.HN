The GP says that picking a sport that makes you fit is the way.<p>To add another opinion, that ties the two together, to the mix: think of the fittest people you know. To a person, they're probably obsessed with their chosen sport (which may be soccer, or bodybuilding, or weightlifting, or running, or ...). These people live and breathe their sport, and when they're not doing it or training for it, they're thinking of how to get better at it.<p>At some point, thinking of how they can get better at it is probably going to lead them to doing, well, a basic strength and conditioning program. That's because squats and presses and the rest of what the article outlines are still about the best the exercise world can come up with for almost all the athletes out there.<p>(For what it's worth, I'd strongly second the recommendations of the article for Starting Strength and Olympic-Style Weightlifting.

So far this tactic has not worked well in the cases where it has been tried, the last gasp of a desperate autocrat.<p>On the other hand, banning the media has worked well in the past, such as when China ordered the media out of Tiananmen before getting serious at the end. The problem is that nowadays with cellphones and twitter, banning the media accomplishes nothing because that merely deputizes the entire populace to become journalists. At Tiananmen no one could post to the internet from their cell phone. Things have changed since then. Now the only way to stop the media is to shut down the internet, cell phones, and land lines that might contact fax machines. But this leaves the autocrat with no reliable feedback about what is going on on the ground, while people manage to communicate news reports via satellite phone, ham radio, pigeons, across the border local wifi, and who knows what else.<p>A big question is what will governments do in response to this loss of control, something they can not stand? Something like the great firewall of china is one solution - leave the internet running but have the ability to monitor 100% of net traffic in real time and block prohibited communication instantly. In the US there is an approach of monitoring traffic for keywords (but no blocking) combined with psyops such as persona management and media control in order to get the sheep to go in the direction the herder wants them to go.",1299264269

If we grant ownership of an idea to someone based on the incredibleness of their invention, then surely an independent inventor deserves the same, or maybe even more, privilege on the idea.<p>Patent cases don't consider whether the alleged infringer ""stole""/copied the idea, or thought of it independently.  The one study that has been done on this appears to support independent invention in almost all cases: <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1270160"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1270160</a>",1299264267

It works particularly well for  small operators who need to put a quirky business on a map.<p>For example, a friend who lives in San Francisco bought a Segway tour of the city, which she would never on earth do had she not seen it on Groupon. She then asked 50 people to join her tour, and then plastered the photos all over Facebook. A lot of people now know these tours exist, and next time we have friends visiting from out of town, we'll be asking her about it. If the Segway tour operator had offered her a promo for referrals, all the more reason for us to remember the tours and book, preferably via her referral link.<p>I suspect the effect is similar to getting your startup covered in Techcrunch. Suddenly you get tons of pageviews and signups, but it's up to the startup to keep people coming back.",1299264153

Has anyone actually done serious research about it outside of the 'developed' world? Also, by my understanding, it doesn't state that long-term lifestyle changes won't make you happier, just that our happiness levels stabilize quickly after sudden changes.<p>Genetics may be one factor, but relative differences in wealth is another huge factor that I <i>know</i> has been observed extensively outside of dominant western culture. In HG societies, there are almost no differences in wealth. Everyone considers themselves pretty well-off because there are very few things (or experiences) in their world that they could want but not have.<p>And even by the objective standard, a HG is better off than someone in the industrial world who has no job, family, home, or love prospects. An average HG has meaningful work, a large and close family, a mate, and considers their entire territory to be their family's ""home"". It isn't a miserable or unfulfilling life at all. The only way you could come to the conclusion that you're still better off is if you held really stereotypical and inaccurate views of how HGs live. Which leads like things like groups of us deciding that we have a moral obligation to nose in on what few HG societies still exist and bestow the gifts of technology and capitalism on them, so that they can live in slums for the rest of their lives and the lives of most of their descendants. Which doesn't exactly make them happy, because they go from being the richest people in their society to the very bottom of the ladder in ours.<p>I'm not going to live my life maximizing my standard of living because money and wealth aren't the same thing. Call it fulfillment instead of happiness if it makes you feel better, but having the biggest pile of money isn't the way to get there.",1299264118

A key element of this closure is the continuation closure, which is implicitly passed in to closures when they get called; the 'RET' type of CPU opcode is the normal way of calling this closure.<p>If one carefully adds stack splitting and duplication capabilities to an ordinary procedural language, it amounts to a conversion to continuation-passing style. Not only does that cut down on some of the drawbacks of massive multithreading on 32-bit (address space exhaustion, though not the expense of context switches), but it also permits interesting implementation strategies (e.g. making call/cc work in C or languages implemented in terms of C, which can in turn be applied to implementation of stateless servers).",1299262874

2289035,comment,2287213,2288439,0,0,enjo,,,"This recalls a conversation I had with a highly noted doctor of nutrition at University of Colorado @ Denver.<p>He was the first to admit that nutrition sciences were largely confused. All of those years of studying cholestrol and various other substances in isolation had led to a ton of barely viable nutrition advice that didn't seem to work in practice.<p>He has come to believe that the research continues to point in a single direction. It's more or less what the OP said, with a bit of twist. The problem isn't processing in the traditional sense... it's processing in the industrial sense. Modern processed foods contain a whole litany of preservatives that seem to have a profound impact on food in two ways.<p>1. It often more or less removes much of the health benefit of actually eating. Vitamins, minerals, and a whole range of amino acids magically disappear. Post-processing foods tend to be left high in carbs and so called ""empty calories"". This is why, in his mind, McDonalds and the like are so damaging. It's why TV dinners (even the 'healthy' ones) are terrible for you. By eating more ""whole"" foods (as the OP suggested) you avoid so much of this.<p>2. Those preservatives themselves trigger body processes that cause all sorts of strangeness. Why can you drink Coke Zero everyday and not lose weight (or Stevia, Splenda, etc..)? Because your body has a natural metabolic reaction to the sweetness. It's still calorie-in/calorie-out, your just sabotaging the calorie out. The prevailing theory about this has something to do with energy storage back in our caveman days. When eating sweet fruits and the like, our bodies would go into energy storage mode for the coming winter. In those days fruits represented one of the few times that we would experience a calorie surplus. Apparently many common preservatives trigger that same response.<p>For the last couple of years I've essentially followed the OP's advice. I eat as close to ""whole"" as I can. I eat quite a bit more meat than he's advertising, but I try to make sure it as unprocessed as possible. I eat a lot of whole vegetables and a bit of fruit. Nuts and the like are a staple. I eat fewer refined carbs, but I don't necessarily try to stay far away from them either.<p>I'm healthier, fitter, and all around in better shape then I ever have been.",1299261777

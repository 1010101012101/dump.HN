Working dashboard here : http://your.gridspy.co.nz/powertech/<p>Right now, we use the jquery sparkines library : http://omnipotent.net/jquery.sparkline/ and some rendered PNGs to show data. The sparklines are JS and render to canvas. All good.<p>Enter the Google Visualisation library : http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/documentation/gallery.html<p>Now some of these are totally awesome. One in particular grabs my attention: http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/documentation/gallery/annotatedtimeline.html<p>However : this annotation requires flash. Do I avoid it for that reason? Should I just query the client to see if they have flash and selectively degrade to an alternative (such as http://danvk.org/dygraphs/)?<p>So, overall, how evil is Flash in your opinion?",1266706746

Newsweek had the story. Drudge broke that they were sitting on the story. Drudge also isn't a blogger. He's a news aggregator that very occasionally does original reporting (which usually consists of leaks of book galleys, and stuff about to be published...often leaked to him on purpose by reporters to drum up interest and drive clicks to the story a few hours later, and in many cases political operatives pushing narratives, especially during campaigns)<p>Felix Salmon also fudges the notion of reporter vs. blogger. He is employed by Reuters, and he blogs for them. How do you draw the distinction between blogger and reporter?<p>I'm not trying to take away from the important transformation that is occurring, but I think that to put it in a binary divide of bloggers vs. old media/MSM reporters is too broad.",1266706672

It already interacts with graphics hardware through numerous other APIs and has the ability to kill your system in innumerable other ways.  An API for hardware acceleration of video decoding should be the least of your worries.<p>Furthermore, this argument would apply just as well to WebGL, which gives graphics hardware access directly to Javascript on any website you visit.  WebGL is awesome and I believe it can be done safely.<p>I don't know much about QTKit but I think it's entirely plausible that it isn't flexible enough for use in Flash.

1139632,comment,1138481,1139153,0,0,jrockway,,,"You're right that calling a functor a container is an oversimplification.  But when you start explaining something at full generality, it only makes sense to people that already understand the full generality.  Once you understand how List and Tree are similar, you can understand how List, Tree, Reader, and IO are similar.  But if you don't see any connections between List and Tree, you are never going to see any connection between List and IO.  So, you need to simplify, understand the simplification, and then try to attack full generality.<p>The same goes for monoids.  Many people won't see any use for ""identity + associative binary operator"".  But they will understand the similarities between ""append to a list"" and ""add numbers"".  Once you see something concrete, then you can worry about abstraction.  If you don't understand the concrete, though, you aren't going to get there from the abstraction.<p>(Nobody ever said, ""I'll define a functor to be ...  Now I'll write a program with this functor!""  Instead, they noticed how lists and trees were similar, and invented the functor abstraction afterwards.  If you learn and discover things the same way they did, you'll eventually have the same deep understanding they do.  That understanding is what allows you to use the abstractions, not the definition you find in a textbook.)<p>So anyway, if you are teaching people Haskell, it's better to teach them the concrete.  Once they understand that, you can amend the definition to be fully abstract.  Then they will be comfortable with the abstraction and its applications.",1266705536
1139631,comment,1139492,1139492,0,0,martythemaniak,,,"A lot of Android's criticisms come from the fact that people expect it to be an iPhone - they want the screens to scroll like the iPhone, they want to navigate apps using header buttons (instead of the standard back button), they want shaking to undo, they want pressing the trackball to take them home etc. It kinda understandable, as the iPhone is almost everyone's first smartphone, but still pretty silly.<p>If they get over their iphone-centric view, they'd find Android has many strengths. The standard buttons (home, back, menu) actually improves usability immensely, since you never have to care how a specific app wants to place its navigation elements or options etc. You know the back button will almost always take you back/cancel, you know that if you're ever in doubt, the menu button will save you etc.<p>I also very much appreciate the fact that the phone doesn't treat me like a dumbass. For example, while the iphone is easier to unlock the first time around (pretty hard to miss the SLIDE HERE TO UNLOCK message), it becomes stupid and annoying after awhile and takes away from the aesthetic appeal. Or the fact that the only allowed customization you can make is to re-arrange your icons, rather than making the phone YOURS and seeing what you actually want to see.",1266705524

Where else are you going to read it? So the equation there is whether reading on a screen is better than not reading the particular material at all. Whereas with e-books the equation is whether reading on a screen (and the other benefits of e-books) is better than reading a physical book. Given some of the less than desirable characteristics of reading text on an LCD those benefits may not be enough.<p>Second, you probably spend a lot more time reading on a screen than most people do. If your day job involves using a computer all day (which I'll hazard a guess to a reasonable probability of such, given that this is hacker news) then you'll already have internalized and accepted the tradeoffs of doing a lot of reading on an LCD. But to someone who uses a computer say 1/10th or 1/100th as much as you do they have yet to come to that bridge, and when they do they have a choice as to the technologies they use for screen reading, the slight benefits of e-ink may be enough for them, even if it isn't for you.<p>There are a lot of computer users in the world who have yet to read, say, 1 thousand words of paragraph after paragraph of text in a single sitting on a device. To them the differences between reading text on physical paper, e-ink, or an LCD may be much more significant than for those of us who already spend our days staring at monitors and feel comfortable doing so.",1266704439

I mean, first and foremost, they don't sell data, which is more than you can say for a lot of other companies.  Secondly they provide extensive control over the privacy of various parts of your profile.  Facebook is way more privacy conscious than other companies, so I just don't see the foundation for your criticism.<p>FWIW, i used to work at Spock, which was a ""people search engine"".

This isn't people's souls at stake, it's their immediate health and lives.<p>It's one thing to limit what people put into their body, I'm nod advocating that. It's another entirely to limit what people <i>claim</i>. People can <i>claim</i> anything can cure anything, and then someone who isn't making a fully informed decision then puts their lives at risk, and in the process loses cash to someone who simply made a statement and offered a service.<p>In many other industries, this is okay. The market tends to detect bullshitters and avoid them. Usually it's only a few over-eager suckers who lose some cash and warn everyone else. But in the case of medicine, transactions are done not only in people's money but also with their <i>health</i> as currency. Asking for the market to correct for this asks for an incredible amount of misery and death to occur before a treatment can be identified.

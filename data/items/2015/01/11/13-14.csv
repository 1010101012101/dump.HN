In general, the loanwords in North Korean tend to follow the meaning of the original words, whereas those in South Korean follow the pronunciation of the words.<p>For example, &quot;system memory&quot; is translated as &quot;시스템 메모리&quot; in South Korean, which is basically a transcription that reads as [siseutem memori]. In contrast, the same word is translated to &quot;체계기억기&quot; in North Korean, which is composed of 체계(=system), 기억(=remembering), 기(=machine), as shown in the last figure.<p>And also, they tend to use less word spacing in general. &quot;관리자가입정보설정&quot; in North Korean would be written &quot;관리자 가입 정보 설정&quot; in South Korean.

Maybe separating the change of webtek -> django from the interface change is a bit harder, but you could still try to restrain your self as much as possible and then make a second iteration of the interface after the initial change.<p>I&#x27;ve taken this approach before, when migrating a big product and it worked quite well.

Then you have a bunch of little fuses protecting the wire on each branch circuit. All these fuses are intended to last for the life of the vehicle. The only time they would blow would be on the type of fault that would require further troubleshooting. It is unlikely that you could produce an electronic current limiter that would be cheaper and more reliable than a single use fuse.<p>My father the mechanic used to like to tell me about an exception to the rule as an object lesson about the trade off between risk and reliability. Back in the days of breaker ignitions the ignition circuit was almost never fused. A blown fuse in the ignition circuit could strand people out in the middle of nowhere. The extra risk was acceptable to eliminate the situation where the fuse blew when the ignition might of been able to continue to work in some sort of degraded mode. It was OK that that degraded mode might involve smoke and flame.",1420983203

And, indeed, when I &quot;preach&quot; the realities of biology to the unconverted (and there are so many) I get exactly this kind of pushback, which I fully expect. This is what happens when reality disagrees with people&#x27;s well-entrenched views of it, often created by being exposed to very narrow glimpses of it (reality, that is).<p>But while I often discuss the realities of our world with those who are intentionally ignorant, I find the kind of &quot;pushback&quot; you see here to be the most interesting and entertaining. The &quot;unconverted&quot; in this case, uses what he (and it is almost invariable a <i>he</i>, and a young <i>he</i> in most cases) considers science (or scientific thinking) to fight against other sciences, and chooses to ignore the fact that in the realms of intractable math, definitions are often open to debate, or at least discussion, and that does not make them any less valid.<p>For instance, did you know that even in biology (which yummyfajitas might or might not consider a science, I don&#x27;t know), one of the most basic definitions -- at the very core of the science -- is not so clear-cut, and, in fact, stands in complete contradiction to other well-established facts concerning itself and even to its own definition? And yet, scientists involved in the field are able to look past such things, as they know physics-level rigorous definitions won&#x27;t help their science in this case. I am talking, of course, about the term &quot;species&quot;. While there is a sorta/kinda definition of a species, it is an undisputed fact that any organism belongs to the same species as its direct ancestor(s) -- hence an immediate contradiction. Yet, biologists understand this fuzzy notion of <i>species</i> and go about their business. The reason is that in the intractable sciences (biology, sociology, and even climate), it is often useful to describe a present state, even if the process that originated it is not fully understood. Thus is the nature of intractability.<p>And, after all, we&#x27;re not debating ideas here -- we&#x27;re debating facts. And when facts are debated, I tend to believe those who have actually studied them rather than those who haven&#x27;t and just <i>wish</i> they weren&#x27;t true.<p><pre><code>    A little learning is a dangerous thing; \n    drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring: \n    there shallow draughts intoxicate the brain, \n    and drinking largely sobers us again.\n</code></pre>\nSo, if fajitas chooses not to drink deep, he should at least stop arguing with those who do.",1420982328

You might be able to save the situation by agreeing on some definite milestone that you could reach in, say, a month, and which if you reach it the IP goes to the company.  Then your risk is capped at a month's work, and his is decreased by a month's data about your performance.",1236159404

And even if you were to write a longer post, you still wouldn't have the system that a NYT journalist has",1236158926

But a different model of time doesn't affect its realness.<p>Is temperature an illusion? Certainly not. And yet, as the article says, it's merely a model of the interaction between molecules.<p>Some models explain more than other models. Models that explain more are better. Thinking in terms of real/illusion is not helpful at all.",1236158559

Its been growing steadily for last few months giving me the confidence that we've got the product offering right and we just need to scale and reach out to more people with similar pain point.<p>Last few weeks I've been trying to get some press coverage in mainstream (financial) newspapers. Its been a lot of effort (since I never did this before) and I am getting good response from the journalists.<p>Copule of days back I was quoted in an article in a national paper, along with the name of my website. The article was in a prominent position - back cover page.<p>When I look back at the stats for that particular day, I see no spike in traffic. This makes me wonder if it is worth all the effort that got into getting it.<p>What type of and how much press exposure is required before one starts seeing results, in terms of traffic growth?<p>Would appreciate if you could share your experiences.<p>Thanks",1236157812

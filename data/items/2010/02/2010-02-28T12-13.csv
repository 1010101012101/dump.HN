Mossad requires time to do things properly (getting the job done, covering the trails, not leaving a trail to either operatives, Israel or Mossad itself), but politicians, especially Benjamin Netanjahu required (in 90's) that Mossad perform more operations faster, or so to say ""on demand"" whenever he needed a PR boost. Thus leading to a couple of spectacular failures that left Mossad operatives demoralized and even got them to start talking publicly about the ways of Mossad.<p>Fast forward 10 years. Bibi is in charge again and Mossad blew it again. Hmm???<p>If this is Mossad this is a terrible failure - revealing identity of 25 agents is horrible price to pay. Just imagine what kind of tow this will be on morale of other operatives. Mossad operatives work(ed) so good because they know that the organization will take care of them, that they will be protected and that they are being appreciated (in hacker terms think MS, Google,...).<p>Kinda reminds me of how in IT when PHB type MBA's come around ""demanding results NOW!!!11one!"", engineers loose morale, start leaving and everything goes down the drain.<p>Edit: <a href=""http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/ht/d/ContentDetails/i/9279/pid/897"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/ht/d/ContentDetails/i/9279/p...</a> - describing the previous Netanyahues debacles.",1267359934

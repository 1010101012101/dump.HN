I see your point: &quot;Taking money from the future.&quot; is a figurative term for &quot;Promising money to someone at a future point of time.&quot;<p>Another thing is unclear now:<p>> China allows the Yuan to &quot;inflate&quot; to 10x its current value, and then services the debt with this inflated value.<p>What do you mean with &quot;allow to inflate&quot;?<p>Inflation is growth of the amount of money == new debt needs to be created.

But history and constitutions are just pieces of paper, he wanted to do what he wanted to do because he wanted to do it, even though neither country attacked the U.S. and therefore attacking both of them was a U.N. Charter violation, which we are of course signatories to.

Most of my professional work is in Perl, except for frontend stuff in JS, although we are increasingly using Go for more things.<p>I&#x27;m lucky in that our Perl codebase is very well structured and clean, despite having parts up to 20 years old. It relies very little on objects, generally passing around hashes of information. For error handling we even use something akin to the Either type, instead of using exceptions. But yeah, you could go into another Perl codebase and see a completely different story. I guess that I really lucked out!<p>Anyway, when I walked into this Perl codebase I generally didn&#x27;t feel too far away from Clojure in terms of its basic setup, creating lots of small functions that accept and produce basic data structures. But where I do feel pain is in safely refactoring that code, getting insight into where things are used, and understanding what might happen to be in this plain old hash being passed around. It&#x27;s at this point that I miss having good tooling, in the sense of the tooling I&#x27;ve experienced in Go or Scala. The only dynamic language I&#x27;ve used with comparable tooling is Smalltalk, but unfortunately that&#x27;s not really viable professionally at this time. :(<p>I&#x27;ve heard good things about Cursive Clojure, so perhaps I should give it a try and see what fancy features it has.",1454028594

HTTP being a good example of course.<p>The problem is that open protocols for general purpose data sync are pretty thin on the ground.

But let me give you a bigger one: Json.<p>XML&#x27;s saving grace was that it came with good schemas out of the box, so turning something from XML to, say, a Java object, was not very difficult. It wasn&#x27;t difficult to use a SOAP service without having to do manual serialization work.<p>Today though, we are using something that has, at best, extremely weak types, and with schema equivalents that are bolted on, rarely used, and end up relying on humans understanding exactly what the data looks like, just for serialization/deserialization. I guess you can live with that easily if you are writing in a language that has really weak types in the first place, as you&#x27;d have to read the documentation anyway (What date format is the field using? Better go read about it), but the moment you try to do something even slightly more sturdy, the process is excruciatingly painful.<p>Heck, even tools like try to &quot;help&quot; document APIs, like swagger, end up with specifications that chill the bones.<p>It is as if the web was built for and by people that are absolutely allergic to both specification and types: In a more sensible world, we&#x27;d get something like: If the RDS is postgres, then the data format is like this, and if it&#x27;s MySQL, it&#x27;s like this instead. But what we have out there in the world is big lists of optional fields that will be illegal, or ignored, or who knows what.<p>I was a big XML hater, back in the days of SOAP, but the more I see how services are defined today, the better the old rust bucket looks.",1454027853

How? The government already knows where I live and where I work. If they want to find me and persecute me, they&#x27;ll do it.

If you went to a group of people and said the movie you were all going to was rescheduled from 11pm UTC to 10pm UTC because of DST you&#x27;d get a bunch of &quot;Huh?&quot; and &quot;What local time was it rescheduled to?&quot;  You&#x27;d answer it was rescheduled from 6pm  to 6pm local time.  You&#x27;d get a bunch of laughs at your &quot;geek humour&quot; while they secretly thought you were nuts.  :)<p>Social events like meetings, movies, etc. are not considered rescheduled when DST starts/stops or the TZ rules get changed.<p>If you stored the event as UTC you&#x27;d have to alter your database when DST starts/stops or the TZ rules changed (is your system going to compare the old and new rules automatically now?).",1454025709

For both, what matters is the reputation of the school, really, not the online/physical dimension. For someone like Georgia Tech, <i>they&#x27;re</i> the ones who are going to be badly hurt if they cheapen their online classes, so I&#x27;m reasonably sure that isn&#x27;t going to happen.<p>Accreditation is an attempt to capture that reputation in a way that someone who has no idea about anything else can trust. Unfortunately, while you cannot game real reputation, gaming the accreditation is (almost intentionally) trivial.<p>A PhD, though, requires a lot of one-on-one time with a real faculty member. It&#x27;s very much an apprenticeship sort of position. I&#x27;ve know people who did that remotely, and it&#x27;s <i>harder</i> than doing it while being physically present. Getting a PhD while keeping a full time job is a very bad idea (I&#x27;m perfect evidence of this), and trying to do it &#x27;online&#x27; is going to make that worse.",1454025640

My first professional language was Borland Delphi (strongly typed), then C (weakly typed), then Perl (dynamic), then Java (mostly strongly typed), Scala (very strongly typed) and now I&#x27;m slowly trying to adopt Clojure at my place of work. Out of all those the worst kind of code I&#x27;ve ever come across was in Perl, so for awhile I&#x27;ve blamed the lack of typing as a contributing factor to this. However. Most of the Python code I&#x27;ve seen since around 2001 has been fairly clean looking so that can&#x27;t just be dynamic typing that was to blame. I suspect Perl&#x27;s woes had more to do with the &quot;there is more than one way to do it philosophy&quot; as opposed to types. There&#x27;s just no such thing as idiomatic Perl. In fact I&#x27;m seeing some of this in some Scala code. There are nearly-religious level wars around what constitutes idiomatic Scala way of doing things. I&#x27;ve seen completely insane spaghetti-style Scala classes, especially those that dealt with XML code and DSLs. So far, it seems that Clojure in Java ecosystem is more like Python than like Perl. I.e. only one way of doing things that is fairly clear from the onset.",1454025605

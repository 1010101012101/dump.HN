How would you ask people to explain gaps in their work history? Are you no longer allowed to consider why someone was unemployed for 4 or 5 consecutive years? Additionally, I don&#x27;t think you can easily do general intelligence testing for a job. You have to be able to show that every question relates to job performance and that it does not cause a disproportionate impact on the hiring of people from protected classes.",1433609993
9671432,comment,9671113,9671113,0,0,pushtheenvelope,,,"I’m really excited this was finally shared. A little backstory. This framework is the manifestation of ideas that Mike developed at Mixtent, a startup that produced three products in 2 years and eventually got acquired by Facebook.<p>The biggest advantage this framework has over other more traditional ones like RoR or Django is being able to model product ideas as a graph in code abstractions. This enables product engineers to rapidly prototype ideas (no need to interact with the DB), and jump into features built by other engineers (the node-edge API is standardized).<p>While the first product Mixtent built used more traditional django-style models, it resulted in features that became hard to manage over time. Each model had its own DB table and making changes was painful. The next two were built using a similar graph framework on top of CodeIgniter, and the benefits to prototyping speed and ease-of-understanding were visibly felt by all engineers (including myself).",1433609911

9671429,comment,9670239,9670982,0,0,lambda,,,"CSS/HTML are not meaningfully semantic; they encode presentational attributes of documents and applications. Syntax validation is not semantic; it&#x27;s syntactic. DOM is not either; it&#x27;s an API for manipulating HTML, generally used for presentational purposes. RDF is designed for semantics, but no one of interest uses it. HTTP is a transport protocol; it&#x27;s a way to take an opaque URL plus some persistent state and get a blob of text or binary data back, along with just the barest of semantics about which requests are intended to make persistent changes server side. MathML is this weird semantic/presentational hybrid, of which I have only ever seen the presentational side used; I am aware of no real-world systems that produce or consume the semantic subset of MathML. PNG is an image encoding format.<p>So out of all of that, RDF and MathML are the only things that even attempt to define any kind of semantic encoding, and as far as I can tell they completely fail at that in the real world. For the vast majority of real world services, if you want to extract semantic data out of them you use JSON.",1433609890

Note that I am not only replying to the parent comment here, but also addressing the general conversation descending.<p>The primary disconnect I see in this sort of disagreement about the importance of calories is what we count as &quot;calories in&quot; and what we count as &quot;calories out&quot;. The calories listed on nutrition labels are determined by burning a sample of food in a bomb calorimeter. Since our body does not reach the efficiency of a bomb calorimeter, calories consumed through oral or intravenous ingestion will overstate the number of calories that are used by the human body calories in < calories out. As a stupid example, there is clearly a large amount of energy in wood. A human may ingest wood and &quot;touch&quot; none of the calories contained therein. Should a daily branch of intake count as part of our calories in? Where do we draw the line then? Should we exclude calories from fiber?<p>The nutrition label gives us an upper limit of what we can consider calories in, but does not, on its own, give us an actual value for this measure.<p>The other side of the disconnect is how we measure calories out. Some people consider only energy expenditure, or how many calories ingested are turned into energy for useful work in the body. Some may also consider those calories utilized for structural purposes. Protein does not necessarily get utilized for energy; in fact it is the least desirable energy source of the three macronutrients. Some may also consider the caloric value of excrement for measurement of calories out.<p>So calories in can be calories ingested, or calories &quot;processed&quot; (here loosely defined as anything that doesn&#x27;t pass straight through to stool or urine). Calories out can be calories utilized for useful work, or anything that exits the body, as energy/heat <i>or</i> excrement.<p>Here alone we have enough for significant confusion among reasonable people depending on which definition they are using.<p>I hope this helps those involved in the conversation to clarify what they mean and consider that their conversation partner may be less of a moron than they assume.<p>Add to this that the only piece of this that we can accurately measure across populations is gross calories ingested, and there is a lot of room for reasonable people to disagree on a &quot;healthy intake&quot;.<p>Please note: I am trying to be neutral in this comment, and to only help shed some light on where we find confusion in words. I am explicitly not making an argument for or against any specific interpretation of these words. If you choose to take issue with any inferred stake I hold, have fun. I am perfectly happy to consider discussion on the potential for confusion in the words we use when discussing the issue of caloric intake, though.",1433609737

If hardware designers have no competition for their hardware then there is no reason for them not to make the firmware source available. The only commercial reason for firmware to be secret is the fear that competitors will create alternative hardware designs based which may be compatible with the firmware or even improve  on it, or that the firmware can be enhanced to extend the working life of the hardware.<p>As more and more functions are being baked into software this issue is going to become more critical, and all talk about tackling the planting of secret backdoors into software becomes moot, as it can all be done in firmware without detection.

9671405,comment,9670733,9670733,0,0,astrocyte,,,"As human beings, we long to be understood, accepted, and loved. Casual sex/relationships and the culture centered around it manifests this in short order and duration. The culture of casual sex and relationships benefits corporations the most and is thus heavily promoted by them via numerous media outlets. Divide and conquer... Isolate and manipulate via norms of manipulative games and economic exchanges dictated by corporations who set the dominant ideology.<p>The gold still remains in long term relationships in which there is mutual understanding, acceptance, love, and in which individuals build something lasting with someone and grow. The observation of Sexual Economics, at least in America, is that corporations have come to understand how to manipulate the &#x27;market&#x27; such that it renders them max revenue by ensuring people are perpetually unsatisfied and against each other. In this model, the concept of a stable family is attacked and the supplier (woman) is convinced that it is in their best interest to be as manipulative and self-serving as they can (after-all, they are manipulated to falsely believe that&#x27;s a man&#x27;s mindset). In this model and on the demand side, the man is trained on the idea that they can do nothing to get the supply side to &#x27;see the bigger picture&#x27;. As such, the demand side resorts to counter manipulation practices and removes feeling from the physical exchanges... Everyone against everyone for hollow experiences that need constant reinforcement.. all to the benefit of the corporations. It really results in a delusional, lost, and alone society.. Albeit, economically active.<p>3rd wave feminism centers on this very agenda.\nMeanwhile, men have been pushed into a lessened state of being in which they game their lives and identity to acquire sex/women they have emotional checked out on (Taxing pursuits of empty experiences).<p>That&#x27;s the bigger economic model... Focusing on what the participants have been trained on ignores the driving force and the real &#x27;engine&#x27; which is pure capitalism and profit. So, try not wasting time on what system participants are doing in this forced and set environment and focus more on what&#x27;s the goal of the environment that the participants are subjected to.",1433609479

The problem we have right now is that we have let things go uncorrected for too long.<p>All those &quot;little&quot; problems that never really resolved - the corporation trying to exploit a legal technicality to raise the costs for their competitors, the sociopath manager that ignores labor laws to try raise their profit margin, the politician getting kickbacks from the business in exchange for not passing some regulation - well... in most cases, we never rally addressed these problems properly. A few people got slaps on the wrist. Some were simply declared legal (and therefor moral to many people).<p>Operant conditioning[1] works in humans. We have spent the last several decades training people to see profit as the main goal. We have <i>not</i> been punishing the problems as people inevitably start to test the boundaries of the laws that supposedly limit what they can do. This combination of influences creates a situation where it is <i>entirely rational</i> for someone to start to themselves as being above the law and untouchable. They are simply extrapolating their own experience and observations.<p>So now we have a serious problem on our hands - some people have gotten so emboldened (and enriched),  they have started to take the next step: actually writing this power imbalance back into the law and making their new aristocracy legal.<p>The core of this problem is <i>fear</i>, or the lack of it. Without a belief that there is at least some chance you could be caught, humans tend to act in a manner that reinforces their current situation. A decade ago I would have suggested that we simply needed to start throwing the book at the banks/business/politicians that misbehaved. We <i>used</i> to do that; politicians would resin if they were caught taking bribes, and corporations were occasionally <i>heavily</i> sanctioned or even forcibly dissolved for their crimes. Do you really believe any of that could happen today? I don&#x27;t. We&#x27;ve had plenty of examples, from the &quot;banking crisis&quot; a few years ago, to the CIA getting away with murder and torture without even so much as a <i>show trial</i>.<p>No, if we had any intention of actually putting aside our differences and showing a bit of solidarity against the common enemy of <i>corruption</i>, we would have done it by now. Instead, were still acting like we have the <i>luxury</i> of being able to argue about our traditional political disagreements. Meanwhile, troops and the crony-capitalist apparatchik have been moving into more and more positions of power and influence.<p>The only way this tide is going to be turned back is... very unfortunately... when the people responsible regain their <i>fear</i> that they <i>could</i> could be caught, and the only way that fear will be restore is when they soe a real risk to their own survival. This is what the French  understood when they got out the  guillotines.<p>Of course, this is why the NSA has been working so hard to establish domestic surveillance and working with the FBI on parallel constriction: COINTELPRO never ended, and it&#x27;s still the easiest way to break up any threatening social structure.<p>[1] see; Skinner&#x27;s box on how conditioning can affect <i>volition</i>",1433607694

Back in the day, most RTS were single player games with a nice multiplayer addition.  But you would have problems playing it without going to a friends house/LAN party.  There, you were playing against friends and people you were effectively face to face with.  It was competitive, but you were there for fun.<p>Once the games became focused towards multiplayer, with a single player as the side, the games were mostly about competing against other people, people you didn&#x27;t know, had very little social connection too, and it was all about how fast you could click. I think (at least for me, this was true) made the games much less fun.  To have any chance of actually winning, you had to be very good.  When you&#x27;re playing people you don&#x27;t really know, only to lose the game over and over again online, it doesn&#x27;t quite become as much fun.",1433606666

9671234,comment,9670802,9670802,0,0,fredkbloggs,,,"The author was doing great right up until the last paragraph.  His proposed solution is silly because it makes no distinction between jobs for which a university education is essential and those for which it is irrelevant.  Then there is also the large grey area in between, in which a university education in certain fields might be useful but not essential.  What he would do is abolish the right of those professions in which such an education is essential from applying the same standard he lauds earlier: that physicians must attend medical school.  For engineers, a university education with a specialty in engineering is exactly what medical school is to physicians.<p>Many people here believe that a university education is not required to be a computer programmer, and I agree.  But programmer is a vocation, like plumber or firefighter; it requires specialized skills and experience to do well but does not require a university education.  If you spent 3 months learning one language and one or two common frameworks for making e-commerce sites, you are reasonably qualified to work on e-commerce sites for companies that use that language and framework.  However, being a programmer and being an engineer are not the same; an engineer has been educated both more broadly and more deeply, and should be capable of solving larger and more difficult problems, designing whole systems, and in general should have the education and experience to understand new problems more thoroughly.  It&#x27;s the difference between the architect who designs a building (or one of its systems) and the construction crew who erects it.  Both are essential, but they have (properly) different qualifications.<p>There are many other fields where some sort of education is required.  I agree that many of those fields conveniently piggyback on university education (usually with a particular field of study requirement) when other similar mechanisms might do as well.  But the notion that such an education is universally irrelevant is absurd.<p>If the author wants people without university education to be paid as much as people with it, the solution is not legislation.  Instead, he should hire them.",1433606659

Being able to abuse the currency makes it easy to continue to meet social obligations, but in actuality they&#x27;re defaulting on those obligations through currency devaluation (ie the net result being citizens of the EU will suffer a lower standard of living, while most people won&#x27;t realize what&#x27;s happening until years later).<p>If Japan couldn&#x27;t abuse the Yen to fill the huge hole in their budget that their debt is causing, what would happen to their government? It would have already collapsed, unable to pay its bills. It&#x27;s only the fiat system that enables them to continue.

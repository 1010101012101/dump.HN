Western societies in 1800 were among some of the sickliest and weakest that history has ever known, as population pressure was very high relative to available technology. Death in childbirth and childhood were both very common, and people from the Middle Ages enjoyed better health when using measures of average height. I've read speculation that the British Empire gained its edge because its people were able to get a small dietary advantage.<p>So we should not look at pre-industrial tradition for information on <i>ideal</i> nutrition.

To keep a tall, small based robot from falling over you have two choices:<p>1) You can put a whole bunch of weight in the base. (This is the route that Willow Garage seems to be going. They have a huge lead acid battery in the base. The advantage of this is that it is static and 'always on'. The disadvantage is that your robot has to be really heavy.<p>2) You can be dynamically stable. With this approach when you are bumped you use your drive system to actively deal with the disturbance. The advantage of this is you can deal with much larger disturbances (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkzgglYjNvY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkzgglYjNvY</a>) The disadvantage is that it only works when there is power.<p>I totally agree on the battery failure scenario and it is something we have thought about a lot. We have a separate board that just does the balancing and it has a separate Ultra-capacitor power supply that can power the drive system for several minutes; long enough to put our kickstand down and sit. You can crash the main CPU and pull the batteries out and the robot will sit safely.<p>I don't know if self balancing is for sure better than statically stable, but I think it is less clear cut than what you imply.<p>-Benjie (Engineer at Anybots, obviously)",1274222127

Of course businesses will all use similar tactics to win loyalty. But ""evil and monopolistic"" could only be the case when you're talking about an application or platform like Photoshop or Windows that influences an entire ecosystem of other work. Businesses based around content like music or games stand to benefit from piracy equally well; it's an opportunity for the best creators to rise in popularity and build their brand outside of traditional publishing mechanisms. As pointed out earlier in this discussion, content pirates aren't content buyers and their demographics are wildly different. If they become part of the pool of buyers at a later time(e.g. when they have disposable income), they're going to seek out familiar brands and buy from them. But this doesn't impact any other content business, since it's based almost entirely on the strengths of the work and not lock-in.",1274221196

1359318,comment,1358806,1358806,0,0,danudey,,,"It's somewhat annoying to me that Flash proponents seem to muddy the lines between app development and website development. I've seen so many arguments lately that either Flash is more open than the App Store, so Apple should allow Flash in the browser, or Flash is more capable than HTML5 so Apple should allow Flash apps in the App Store.<p>Flash is less open than HTML5 in the browser, it churns the battery, it's slow, and it's unreliable. It crashes on the Mac often, it doesn't support hardware video decoding (yet) and there isn't a stable version released for ANY Arm platform yet. Adobe is so far behind it's not even funny, and the arguments that Apple should have allowed Flash from the start are ridiculous because three years later it's still not ready for prime-time.<p>As for app development, Flash produces much larger apps that run slower and use more memory than native iPhone apps. There's no way to provide a truly 'native' UI (CocoaTouch) so developers will have to re-invent everything in ways that doesn't work or look like regular iPhone apps. Like Adobe Air apps, Flash apps on the iPhone would end up working and looking different not only from other native apps, but from each other as well. Users would have to get used to different behaviour from every app, instead of having a uniform set of behaviours that they can quickly learn and internalize.<p>If you're going to complain about Flash on the iPhone, it would behoove you to specify which specific implementation of Flash you're referring to, and compare it just to the equivalent offering for the iPhone. Otherwise, you're just making confusing arguments that don't hold water.",1274220952

I would gladly use cljs+reagent for everything if I could.<p>First off, cljs allows you to type less. Second, functionality provided by Immutable.JS is built into the language. Third, I can use paredit. I love paredit. Fourth, google closure has amazing code minification, dead code removal and a good standard library. Fifth, I&#x27;ve found figwheel to be better to react-hot-loader, the latter cannot always reload my application. Sixth, devcards. Seventh, incremental compile speed is faster. Eight, macros can greatly simplify code you&#x27;re writing and allow new syntax to be exposed by libraries (core.async).",1451044656

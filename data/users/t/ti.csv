I&#x27;ve worked on open-source projects, side projects, etc, but most of my time I spent working exclusively on Scribd and Parse. I ran DevOps at Scribd and at Parse (until I found amazing folks to take over those roles). I was on &quot;pager duty&quot; for many years at Scribd, and then again for the first year of Parse. I&#x27;ve done everything from fundraising to engineering to sales to sysadmin to biz dev to DevOps to waking up 7 times in one night when my database kept falling over. I promptly fell over myself the next day.<p><i>Background:</i><p>I studied theoretical physics in graduate school, although I was not a physics major in undergrad (Dartmouth, Econ and CS, summa cum laude). I&#x27;ve been programming since I was 12 years old. I made a 3000 LOC RPG that absolutely no other person was interested in.

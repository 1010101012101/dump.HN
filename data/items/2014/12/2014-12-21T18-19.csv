8780539,comment,8779799,8779799,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"This is bad advice. The right answer is often to change jobs, but the explanation given here is pretty terrible.<p>If you have a pattern of working significantly less in your first 6 months on a job than later on, then you&#x27;re making a mistake. That&#x27;s the time to establish a reputation, figure out what is worth working on, and get a mental map of the organization so that you can actually get things done. It&#x27;s the hardest time in a job, if you do it right.<p>If you let the &quot;honeymoon period&quot; blind you and slack in your first 6 months, you start getting grunt work thrown at you and that&#x27;s how you end up overwhelmed and struggling at the 3-year mark. If you do the first 6 months <i>right</i> and gain the credibility, alliances, and reputation that&#x27;ll put you on a good vector, you (a) have a much higher chance of getting on a fast-track, which means better work rather than more of the same, and (b) can get away with slacking and recharging (as you seek external promotion) if you are passed-over for some reason.<p>Also, for higher-level positions, switching jobs often means changing locations and doing that every year is pretty miserable... especially if you have kids. At some point, you&#x27;re specialized enough that unless you live in New York or SF-- which are pretty much out once you have kids, unless you&#x27;re in a hedge fund or a VC firm-- you&#x27;re going to have to stick with a job for a few years just because there aren&#x27;t many jobs in your specialty and location.<p>It&#x27;s worth changing jobs for a genuine promotion, but a high frequency of lateral movement looks really bad. Given also that it can be hard to tell if a new job is a genuine promotion, it&#x27;s better to stay where you are if you have something good and you&#x27;re continuing to advance.",1419188354

Given that the jumper is located right next to the flash, I&#x27;m inclined to believe this is a true hardware protection; likely the middle pin is connected to the write-enable of the flash, the left pin is connected to a GPIO so the software can control it, and the right pin is connected to a constant voltage to disable any writing via hardware. The open position leaves the pin free to allow writes.",1419188339

It&#x27;s been 3 years since I was in that business and my opinion isn&#x27;t any less absolute. The current system is broken, very broken and it is crazy to me that we continue to support it. Even this thread is an example why change is difficult. An education system is very complex and new idea&#x27;s are interpreted in the context of the current system, so it makes it very difficult to explain without writing a white paper.

I thought having started two startups prior with some success would make it easy but I was wrong.<p>The reality is that the default of any state of any startup is failure. You probably won&#x27;t understand the magnitude of the problems you&#x27;ll face until you see them directly. At this point, your ideas are just ideas and you should work on validating them.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of ways to go about doing this and it&#x27;ll really depend on the market you&#x27;re chasing. It&#x27;s likely that a combination of customer interviews and sales will let you gauge which of your ideas have promise and which won&#x27;t. Something that really helped me was thinking about questions VCs ask when they&#x27;re evaluating a startup. What&#x27;s your unfair advantage? Why hasn&#x27;t this worked before and why will it work now? These questions are incredibly important even if you&#x27;re not interested in raising venture. There&#x27;s a lot of books and literature on the web so I won&#x27;t get into this deeply.<p>You probably noticed that I didn&#x27;t say writing code. Sometimes writing code is how you should be validating your idea but most of the time it isn&#x27;t. You should get in that mindset. However, when you need to write code there&#x27;s a few ways to get over that commute drain:<p>1.) Wake up earlier and put some time in before you start your day.<p>2.) Live closer to your job. It&#x27;ll alleviate a lot of the problems of coming home and not wanting to do more more work.<p>3.) Write code on the weekends instead.<p>Also, whatever you do, don&#x27;t do it alone. I did it alone for the first time and it&#x27;s awful. Your job is a great place to find future cofounders or employees. Do hackathons with them on the weekends. Tell them your ideas. See what they excited about.<p>A year later, I&#x27;m doing some consulting on the side to pay the bills and getting into a pivot that&#x27;s finally moving the needle. Even though most of this year was a total failure, I couldn&#x27;t be happier and I&#x27;m glad I did what I did.

Google&#x27;s &quot;knowledge graph&quot; can answer simple questions, based on scraped Wikipedia data, and the core part of the site (the search engine) presents users with a semi-random set of links, basically telling them to find the answer on someone else&#x27;s site. It&#x27;s like a librarian that knows a little bit of info (but not quite enough) who then tells you which part of the library to go to find a book that may or many not have the answer to your question.

8780497,comment,8780014,8780014,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"TL;DR: it doesn&#x27;t sound like you should jump ship.<p><i>Everyday I feel like I want to leave to start something of my own.</i><p>This is a normal impulse, but until you&#x27;re getting a solid signal that you <i>can</i> start something of your own, and without taking onerous financial risk, don&#x27;t take it too seriously. It&#x27;s &quot;freshman wants to drop out and write a novel&quot; syndrome. Everyone goes through it, and we survive. You&#x27;d be weird if you didn&#x27;t have this impulse on occasion.<p>Size up your current situation for whether you&#x27;re getting the mentorship and resources and connections that&#x27;ll make you be able to be a founder for real, and preferably without severe financial risk. If you are, great. (I&#x27;m guessing that you&#x27;re not there yet, but a good startup will put you on the path.) If you&#x27;re not, find a way to change your job as it currently is, in order to make it so. This may mean befriending people in upper management (a skill worth learning) or furtively re-focusing your efforts toward networking and career growth (also a skill worth learning) or something else.<p>If you&#x27;re considered to be a valued contributor, then see if the founders will introduce you to investors on a casual, social basis. Yes, it&#x27;s a political risk to ask, but this kind of political risk is insignificant in comparison to the risk involved in starting your own project.<p><i>I am always so exhausted after writing code for 8-9 hours a day that I definitely don&#x27;t want to come home after commuting for 45 minutes (plus I like having somewhat of a social life).</i><p>If that 8-9 hours of work is advancing your career, it&#x27;s not wasted. If it&#x27;s not, then start slacking a bit (once you&#x27;ve established a solid reputation based on your first months, you can) and direct your focus toward building contacts and advancing your technical knowledge-- that is, work hard on the parts of the job (as you define it) that advance your career and slack on the stupid shit that doesn&#x27;t.<p><i>I feel like I will enjoy it more.</i><p>That&#x27;s &quot;grass is greener&quot; syndrome. If you&#x27;re a natural entrepreneur (and it&#x27;s OK if you&#x27;re not; they&#x27;re only ~1% of the population, and people who are not that can still be great entrepreneurs) then you&#x27;d enjoy bootstrapping, even though you&#x27;d have no money most of the time and most people (including almost all of the VC-funded entrepreneurs) would find it exhausting and miserable, and would rather give up some autonomy for a stable income. (The trait of the natural entrepreneur is an outlier stance on the rich-versus-king spectrum.) It&#x27;s completely OK if you&#x27;re not a natural entrepreneur; I&#x27;m certainly not. That just means that you&#x27;re going to want to work for someone else and learn on their risk and dime, for at least 5-10 years, before you&#x27;re confident enough to go out on your own.<p>If you&#x27;re not a natural entrepreneur, though, you&#x27;re not going to start a business unless you have funding already delivered (and, by the way, that&#x27;s probably the right strategy for most). If you&#x27;re going to try to raise a seed round with no connections, forget &quot;enjoyment&quot;. The odds are against you, and fundraising if you&#x27;re not part of the in-crowd (and it sounds like you&#x27;re not, because that&#x27;s 0.1% of the Valley, and it sounds like you&#x27;re under 25, and you&#x27;re in an employee role at a startup) is <i>fucking miserable</i>. People have been driven to suicide by the fundraising process. It is that fucking bad. Of course, if you run into a business co-founder who comes with the resources in-hand... that problem goes away. Then again, you&#x27;re also likely to be #2 at best. It depends on you whether that&#x27;s OK.<p><i>Plus, I feel I&#x27;m really only learning from myself at the startup.</i><p>You&#x27;re ~22. Unless it&#x27;s a shit-house, you&#x27;re not the best and most experienced programmer there. Find someone you can learn from and start asking for his or her time, preferably in small amounts. See if he&#x27;ll talk about his favorite subject over lunch. Internal networking is as important a skill as external networking. Take this opportunity to learn it. Mentors aren&#x27;t &quot;assigned&quot; from the top, and finding &quot;a mentor&quot; or &quot;a rabbi&quot; is really rare. It&#x27;s more sustainable and practical to learn a little bit from a larger number of people.<p>This is a great opportunity to learn things (such as internal networking, and how startups work) on someone else&#x27;s risk and dime. But it&#x27;s not going to be handed to you on a silver platter.<p><i>I should stay for 6 more months and get my small amount of equity to see what it will be worth. Even at an absurd outcome >1B the payout won&#x27;t affect my life all that much.</i><p>Employee equity is, except for executives, usually a fucking joke. It&#x27;s good that you learned that early on. Don&#x27;t get bent out of shape about the fact. It&#x27;s just worth recognizing the equity is almost never worth making career sacrifices over. If you have 20% of a business, you might favor the needs of the business over your own career goals and reputation. At 0.05%? Pfft. Think of it as a lottery ticket, and keep an eye on your own career objectives because, unless you&#x27;re lucky and become the protege of someone important, no one else will.<p>That said... even if the equity isn&#x27;t a reason to stay, your reputation is. Six-month stints look like absolute shit on your CV, and if you leave a &quot;rapidly growing startup&quot; to go out on your own but can&#x27;t raise, it&#x27;ll look like you were fired. The job-hopper stigma is fucking shitty, but it&#x27;s real. Tech is more forgiving of job-hopping than, say, Wall Street or government, but leaving at 6 months just looks really bad. I&#x27;d say that, unless the job is horrible, that alone is a reason to tough it out for another year.<p>If it becomes clear that the startup is going to do nothing for your career, then drop the focus on your assigned stuff and put time into building the skills you want for your next gig (&quot;powerslacking&quot;). It&#x27;s easier to act productive and engaged when powerslacking (another skill you might as well learn early on) then when just fucking around.<p><i>Any other things to consider? Any advice? I feel like other people have had similar thoughts or even experience leaving.</i><p>Yes. The time to ditch a startup is when you&#x27;re no longer growing with the company. If you keep getting better projects and promotions, stick with it. (It&#x27;s too early to tell, because you&#x27;ve only been there for 6 months.) It&#x27;s when the company starts growing above you that you should bounce. Good startups promote internally, but most startups are crappy and pull their leadership from the outside (a social-climbing mentality) and when it gets into the state that you know you&#x27;ll never be promoted because externals are going to get the best projects and roles, that&#x27;s when you should jump.

If you&#x27;re burned out now after 8 hour days, wait until you&#x27;re doing 14 hour days to survive with your startup... if you can&#x27;t find the energy to do it at night (or your social life is more important to you), you&#x27;re possibly not cut out for running your own startup<p>3.)

I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s risking dying from falls and such quite yet.<p>After reading Atul Gawande&#x27;s book on ageing, aside from cancer and muscle weakness, it seems that one of the biggest killers is the dissolving of your skeleton as you age. When your skeleton weakens (e.g. in osteoporosis and other conditions), that alone is dangerous from a bone snapping standpoint, but those minerals and proteins don&#x27;t just disappear. The excess calcium, released toxins (e.g. previously trapped lead if you were exposed before, and just stuff that shouldn&#x27;t be in your blood), bio active proteins, etc wreck havoc on your organ systems as they are released into your blood.

The scientific signs pointing to the idea that humanity will eventually be able to halt the aging process altogether are compelling:<p>First, there are species of jellyfish and lobster (among others) that do not age. The mechanism of chromosomal deterioration isn&#x27;t there. There are even plankton varieties that revert to a larval state <i>after</i> adulthood. Additionally, there are many life forms that, whether or not they actually age, are thousands of years old.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest-living_organisms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest-living_organism...</a><p>In other words, aging is far more elastic and non-linear than first meets the eye.<p>And it&#x27;s easy to understand why we evolved to age and die: Clearing out older populations leaves more resources for newer, fitter ones (in the evolutionary sense). Death became advantageous, but it&#x27;s not, from a biological perspective, necessary.<p>So if you combine these two ideas together -- things don&#x27;t really <i>need</i> to die but it just so happens that humans do -- does anyone really believe that technology won&#x27;t find a way to beat the aging process, either by genetic modification or maybe nano-level chromosome reconstruction? At some point it&#x27;ll be as &quot;correctable&quot; as laser eye surgery.<p>The implications of halting aging are staggering, earthshattering... there is not enough hyperbole in the English language to do it justice.

My guess would be that the percentage would be much higher for people who don&#x27;t work in their field, but in many cases it&#x27;s still just a statistic.<p>2. There is no path for job growth in many STEM fields except out of STEM and into management. Most people staying in a STEM job for 20+ years find themselves under pressure to move to management, in part because it is somehow easier for companies to pay the salary in middle management than in STEM for someone with a lot of time in the field.<p>Still, some people just change their minds, or actually want to work in business or some field considered non-STEM, but do their undergraduate work in STEM. Additionally, many STEM fields require a level of specialization that usually requires an advanced degree or long-term work in the field to acquire that specialized knowledge. Many people get discouraged by this when they see their student debt and their lack of employment options after getting a Bachelor&#x27;s degree, so, if they continue in higher education at all, they look at getting a degree in something else (like an MBA).",1419184846

Founders should insist on product excellence, but release early (be embarrassed by the first version).<p>2. Startups only die when their founders give up, but founders who don&#x27;t cut their losses at the right time lose credibility.<p>3. [The one at hand...] The best founders are driven by a secret about the world that other people don&#x27;t know yet, and yet good founders are never married to an idea.<p>None of those things are actually contradictory, though:<p>1. An MVP is not a shitty product, it is a <i>minimal</i> product (founders should be embarrassed by lack of features, but the ones that are there should work well).<p>2. Both statements are true, even if uncomfortable. Add to the list of difficult balances founders must achieve.<p>3. Both statements are true here, too. I suspect that the best founders are actually driven by a family of secrets (&quot;hypotheses&quot; in the essay at hand) and yet would not think twice about adapting them in the face of new evidence. (Your example of Darwin is a good one to consider here--he stuck to his beliefs because he had strong evidence for them, and he would have changed his beliefs had new evidence presented itself. The prevailing opinion of society did not factor into that process.)",1419184825

You can also easily use these as your from address, so even in direct correspondence, you still shield your primary address from the recipient.  (This allowed me to verify that eMusic sells their subscriber list to spammers.)<p>A free alternative is SneakEmail (<a href=""http://www.sneakemail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sneakemail.com</a>) which allows you to set up disposable addresses that forward to your primary account, and allows you to set up pre-forwarding filters.

I think it's obvious that those sites offered a level of interactivity that the current BH page does not though, so I feel like you're being a little disingenuous here.<p>I guess I'm not clear on what you meant in your original post then. Did you mean that If the web consisted of the pages that were around in 1997 we wouldn't have weekly security updates and 600K memory-hog browsers? Or did you mean that if people designed web-pages to be informational and not interactive we wouldn't have those problems? I interpreted your comment as the latter, but I would take issue with both.<p>In the end my problem with your comment is that it's a lot like saying ""If we didn't have email, we wouldn't have spam"" or ""If cars didn't have windows, it would be harder to break into them."" It just seems like silly nostalgia. I suppose I should have articulated this more clearly from the beginning.",1257101623
915379,comment,914685,914685,0,0,chris123,,,"Speaking of scams and scam companies, I’m dealing with a company named MindJet, which makes a mind mapping program called MindManager, which I wanted to test against the open-source programs.  BTW, the open-source programs are better, as one might expect.<p>Before purchasing the software (to test) I contacted the company to ask about the software itself, as well as their refund policy. I was emailed back by Christian Walter, who said they offered a 30-day money back guarantee.<p>I purchased the software, tried it, determined that it did not meet my needs, to put it nicely, and certainly was not something that was worth any money.  Therefore, I emailed the company to request my refund.  This is where the fun starts.<p>When I requested my refund, Christian at MindJet effectively denied the request (in my opinion) and told me I would have to download a form, swear on it, sign it, and fax it to an international number.<p>On the form it said all fields must be completed or else no refund. One of the fields was “Customer Number,” which it says is listed on your invoice. That is not true (at least not on the invoice I have, nor anywhere on ""my"" account on their website).<p>The other part of their scam (that's what I call this kind of business practice) is that when you buy the product they throw in a “free” year of support. What they don’t tell you is that this is really a subscription for <i>paid</i> support, with the first year free, and that they will bill you annually starting next year unless you: (1) figure this out, (2) figure out how to opt out, and (3) do it in time.<p>I’m still dealing with this MindJet issue, gathering info for a detailed blog post with screenshots. Tune in later to see how the story ends, if they refund me on their own or I have to dispute the charge with Mastercard (I’ve already met the requirements to dispute the charge and am just waiting to see what they will do).<p>In meantime, I can tell you that, based on this experience (on its own and in comparison with every other company I have ever done business with), I consider MindJet a scam company.  If their business practices are legal, they seem at least highly deceptive, tricky, and unethical (to me).  Again, this is only my experience and opinion, so take it for what it's worth.",1257101561

Where things get interesting/contentious is when people who share community view A assume everyone else agrees with B and get indignant or defensive when they discover that this view is not shared.  There is nothing about ""hackers"" or startups or other standard topics of this community that necessitates a unique viewpoint, so why assume the rest of the community is going to tolerate large divergence from a standardized norm?

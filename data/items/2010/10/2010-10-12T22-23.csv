Every grocery store, I'm sure, calculates how much they can discount some items to draw you into the store so you pay exorbitant prices for others. In the end, they profit. If all prices were accessible online, it would be possible to write an application to minimize consumer spending, but this would cause the whole system to collapse. If all consumers could get all the deals everywhere--throughout their whole shopping list--the grocery stores wouldn't profit.",1286924229

These aren't the cuddly nerds we made movies about in the 80's. They're very angry that the cheerleader still wants to go out with the quarterback."" This is stupid because (i) nerds were <i>never</i> cuddly, it's just that in the 80s Hollywood created a fantasy kid-nerd persona (e.g. <i>War Games</i>) that was out of sync with reality, and (ii) being a frustrated nerdy guy and being angry with the cheerleader does not make you ""deeply misogynistic"", that's just being young.

If you want to attribute all of a person's success to the school they pass through, be my guest. I can similarly say the IRS is the cause of the US being a ""20'th century powerhouse"" - after all, 100% of US businesses are taxed by the IRS.<p>But the fact is, the US is fairly unique in terms of innovation and growth. The education system is, by most measures I've seen, fairly mediocre [1]. And additionally, a fairly large amount of our workforce, particularly at the higher ends, didn't even use the public education system. It seems like an extraordinary claim to attribute the success of the US to our public schools. Yeah, we need public schools/indoor plumbing/electricity, but it would be similarly silly to claim we are a powerhouse as a result of those services.<p>[1] As far as I'm aware, this was always the case.

Filing 1099s was really easy.  If I had to, I could probably even do it retrospectively to meet this >$600 requirement without breaking a sweat: my business credit card aggregated all yearly purchases by merchant and by category.  It would be a simple matter of looking at my year-end statement as all my business expenses were paid with that account.  Also, the most basic Quicken-like accounting packages offer the same functionality.  If there are market gaps for simple software (or bank statement reporting) they will be filled quickly.  So I think this is much ado about a very small problem.<p>Still, there's a good chance the opposition to this relatively minor reporting requirement will force it to be repealed.  If it does go into effect, I would expect the IRS to offer better automated filing for 1099s if for no other reason than to make their own jobs easier.<p>I have trouble believing those who complain so loudly about this requirement (thread parent excluded) because so often they are opposed to the health care legislation on other grounds.  On balance, this health care law is designed to be a huge net positive for small businesses-- in addition to new tax credits to help them pay their employees' premiums, for the first time there will be public group policies available in the new health care exchanges with real competition.  Costs should go <i>down</i> for small businesses, <i>significantly.</i>  Doing a couple hours of extra accounting each year pales in comparison to these benefits.",1286923555

      any offsetting disadvantages, and
    * what's being patented would not be independently
      re-discovered before the patent's expiration
</code></pre>
In practice neither happens: copycats tend to be comparatively incompetent, and simultaneous inventions is more the rule than the exception.<p>I think the core disconnect is whether those two points are taken as true or false: you get the imagery of some lone heroic inventor being always crushed by some conglomerate that patents could save him from; a more accurate version would be a bunch of small businesses that keep doing cool things at more-or-less the same time which the conglomerates pick up on after a year or two, and nobody has the concept of going broke on legal fees arguing over who's allowed to do what.<p>> Yeah, these monopolies make sense if I have to set up a plant, or do years of research, but that's not true in software anymore.<p>The hard part of software is figuring out <i>what</i> to do, reimplementing a program is easy (thus the prevalence of programs that are ""clones"" of other programs).

Two rivers border the land, and the community sits atop 56 known water wells.<p>This is a meme invented by people who&#x27;ve read about oil wars. The problem is that water is very cheap to produce with electricity. Desalination plants are efficient and the price of water they produce is competitive. In addition, the price of water per kg is extremely low. This means that transporting water over large distances like oil is transported is probably non-profitable. It simply means that it&#x27;s cheaper (and cheap) to produce drinking water from salt water. There are not many landlocked countries.",1388061555

6966087,comment,6964923,6965271,2,0,randallsquared,,,"> it would be an awful ux if words needed to be added explicitly to the dictionary.<p>What I&#x27;m learning today is that there is no such thing as best UX practices.<p>Some people are clearly adamant that having to add words explicitly is awful.  After all, the phone should be able to figure out what is wanted, right?<p>Other people are just as certain that having the phone implicitly add words using any specific rule will fail often enough that it&#x27;s obviously worse UX to try.<p>I find myself in sympathy with both camps.   I would <i>like</i> my devices and environment to just know what I want and do it without my having to explicitly direct actions.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working out that way for a lot of areas.  Instead, we have a mishmash situation where devices and apps try to do what most people want, and fail fairly often for a given user (unless I&#x27;m a major outlier).   Ten years ago, when my computer failed to do what I expected, I understood that I&#x27;d failed to use it properly.   I read documentation until I understood the failure or, at least, had some idea of what I might have done wrong, and tried again, and eventually I would understand the system.<p>Now that the system is supposed to understand me, I&#x27;ve noticed two effects:<p>First, detailed documentation of user interfaces is incredibly scarce.   I wonder if there&#x27;s a perception among other developers that if you need documentation, the UX has failed, and therefore the most direct route to apparently better UX is to have less documentation?<p>Second, I find that partly due to the apparent complexity of my phone (or perhaps personification of it), I&#x27;m more likely to just swear at it and complain about it than to actually try to understand what I&#x27;m doing wrong.",1388061444

I&#x27;ve got some friends that really pushed really high on that whole &quot;recruiting via web scrapping&quot; thing - <a href=\"https://masterbranch.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://masterbranch.com/</a> ( feel free to contact them, they are really nice guys ).<p>I wish you luck because I understand this approach never really worked for anyone. IMHO, it&#x27;s simple [Disclaimer: I created a super fancy ATS software / job board too and did all the sales up to a point of really hating HR people :)], recruiters are truly lazy and are interested only on tools that do their job - something understandable as the sourcing part of the job is really weary. Web scrapping tools instead of doing their job just add more noise to it, i.e. forward them tons of profiles that are not really interested in the specific job posting they are marketing. You might think most developers are always open to move because some of us might be, but many people are really happy with their daily jobs, so this sort of tool always ends up making angry both sides of the coin: the developer and the recruiter.<p>So, it does not really matter that your &quot;database&quot; has 4M people on it. Even if those are somehow linked to the company recruiting. When as a recruiter I search for &quot;node.js programmer&quot; and get 100 results back but 99 of them are not interesting in changing jobs, well... that sucks. I wouldn&#x27;t use the tool again myself. And going further with this example, well, believe me, most recruiters would think the tool sucks if just the first three profiles are not interested in the job.<p>But hey, I insist, I wish you the best of luck.

Or that&#x27;s the goal, anyway.<p>&quot;Our farm workers and suppliers still want to get paid in pesos,” Ken Johnson, the project’s founder and managing partner, explains. &quot;But Bitcoin as the John Galt coin? Why shouldn&#x27;t it be?”<p>If the world economic system &quot;goes sideways,&quot; as Mr Johnson puts it, residents will retreat to their self-sufficient gated community, where they will enjoy a shooting range, equestrian facilities, and spa and fitness center. The 6,874-hectare site (pictured) also includes a 100-hectare farm, although it is not clear who will pick the lettuce when the world ends.<p>Galt&#x27;s Gulch Chile—a name impossible for local Spanish-speakers to pronounce—will also boast an innovation centre, where expatriate libertarian dentists and chiropractors may ply their trade. In exchange for Bitcoin, of course.<p>In the event the world economic system fails to collapse on schedule, however, Mr Johnson has a plan B—his new trademark, Galt&#x27;s Gulch Organics. &quot;The farm came with 65 hectares of lemons,&quot; he says. &quot;The US and Japanese markets pay a premium for organic, non-GMO produce.&quot; Plans are in the works to plant herbs, spices, fruit, nuts, and vineyards, and organic certification is not far off.<p>A quirk of Chilean law makes land, mining and water rights independent of each other. Mr Johnson made sure to acquire all three, particularly the water rights. &quot;In the future, wars will be fought over water,&quot; he says. Two rivers border the land, and the community sits atop 56 known water wells. Galt&#x27;s Gulch bottled mineral water may soon be in the offing. Mr Johnson is also building guest haciendas to house not only prospective buyers, but also, he hopes, tourists.<p>Set in a secluded valley 17 kilometres from Curacavi, Chile, on the road between Santiago and the luxurious beach resort of Viña del Mar, Galt&#x27;s Gulch is a mere forty-five minutes by car from the Santiago airport, but, as Mr Johnson says, &quot;it feels like you&#x27;re at the end of the Earth.&quot; Yet his goal is not isolationist, he adds. &quot;We&#x27;re not trying to hide from the world. In fact we want people to find us.”<p>Indeed, of the 430 lots for sale, only 12% have sold so far, and Mr Johnson is marketing vigorously to the libertarian and Bitcoin communities. Lots are priced in both dollars and Bitcoin, with big discounts for buyers who pay in that crypto-currency. Many early adopters of Bitcoin find themselves sitting on small fortunes, and Mr Johnson hopes to tempt them to diversify into real estate. So far nine clients have paid in Bitcoin, totaling around $1.5m in revenue.<p>Mr Johnson, a former California real estate agent and evangelist of water ionizers (devices supposed to slow aging and prevent disease, but derided as snake oil by many scientists) has become something of a celebrity in libertarian circles. Authors such as Ben Swann, Josh Tolley, Luke Rudkowski, Bob Murphy, Angela Keaton, Tatiana Moroz and Wendy McElroy have visited the site of his future utopia, and a television production company is pitching a documentary series on the community.<p>Most buyers so far, he says, are expats or second-home buyers. For Mr Johnson, the appeal is easy to explain. &quot;It&#x27;s like California, only forty or fifty years ago. Feels like you&#x27;ve stepped back in time.” Mr Johnson plans to break ground in 2014, and estimates five years to fulfill his vision of a place where he can &quot;live and let live, thrive and let thrive.”<p>Why does he think his project will succeed where similar schemes have failed? &quot;We&#x27;re a freedom-minded community, but we&#x27;re not trying to create a sovereign state,&quot; he explains. &quot;We pay our taxes, we obey the law. Our goal is to lessen the effect of the rest of the world without telling the world to go take a flying leap.&quot;<p>As for Ayn Rand, just how much have her ideas influenced the community&#x27;s design? Mr Johnson admits he never finished “Atlas Shrugged”. &quot;I&#x27;m not actually much of a reader,&quot; he says. &quot;Watched the movie and skimmed the Cliff&#x27;s Notes, though. Good stuff.&quot;",1388060257

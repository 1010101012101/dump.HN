I just wish they touched more on how the Google acquisition unfolded, rather than the ""we met some people, yadda yadda"" approach.  But I'm guessing they're not at liberty to discuss all the details :)",1186725387

41182,comment,41100,41135,0,0,parker,,,"lol, I can picture it as well... it brings to mind that memorable quote from the movie Contact:<p>""What's the first rule of government spending...?  Why buy only one when you can have two for twice the cost?""<p>This entire venture feels like the startup equivalent of Gigli: it seemed ridiculous before it was released, and even more ridiculous afterwards.",1186724970

41180,comment,41100,41124,0,0,natrius,,,"Large groups of people aren't good at entrepreneurship. That doesn't mean a large corporation can't give a small group of people autonomy to go off and do their own thing. You don't get all of the benefits of being a startup, but you still get some of them.<p>But yeah, this is definitely going to fail.",1186724188
41179,comment,40955,40955,0,0,parker,,,"Now that MySpace is owned by MegaCorp, it feels like it has assumed the role of 'cash cow' in their product matrix.  Not much innovation has come out of MS in awhile (some would argue ever).  I may be a disaffected Gen-Y'er, but cmon now, it's fairly boring!  Rupert will just squeeze it until every drop is coaxed out, and the only active users out of 20 Billion (or thereabouts) are Ronald McDonald and Cher.",1186723816

Oracle for instance has some interesting text-search stuff builtin to the DB.  But if you know you need that, then you are already starting to narrow the list of candidates.",1186723173
41175,comment,40847,40847,0,0,weeblyrocks,,,"If this person actually had a good college education they'd understand the concept of opportunity cost.  The more well educated you are, the higher your opportunity cost.  <p>Having a top college in your pocket can also help build your network if you use it right.  The author also misinterprets causation and correlation.  Just because X% of the richest people in America are dropouts is meaningless.  What % of the total population has a college degree?  Probably something like 30%.  That just shows this guy's article is poorly thought out.<p>It's a nice sensational headline but it falls flat on its face in terms of logic.  ",1186722682

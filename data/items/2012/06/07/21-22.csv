A couple of others that come to mind with a similar theme:<p>A bank was going to turn down an account for some long-haired young man in jeans who wanted his statements forwarded all over the place. Then some young employee told the middle-aged manager he was a wealthy rock star who needed his bank statements available while touring.<p>Some young bank teller with an attitude was being an ass to a guy in coveralls or similar, covered in paint and looking kind of like a day laborer. He finally got mad and said he would move his accounts if he did not get treated properly. She continued with the attitude and told him ""Go ahead"". He was the owner of a construction company and his accounts were worth millions. (Edit: And, yes, he moved them.)",1339106370

Many jobs are pretty much clock-in, clock-out, which means that before & after work you don't have to worry. In some ways this can be better. Often you can cut back your hours to 4 days a week or some other way. (I did it; more than 1 friend has taken my advice and done this, too.) Consulting is often more stressful and demanding, even if you work much fewer hours. A steady paycheck can ease your mind; consulting pays more, but less steadily (usually). Those are the variables. I chose consulting because we worked in short, but manic, bursts, and pocketed $15-40k at a click. But YMMV.",1339106248

There was a time when the idea of users accepting/rejecting cookies on a per-site basis seemed plausible (though it might be annoying for the user), but those days seem long gone.  Cookies are on by default and my guess is few users change those settings.  DNT might be viewed as another attempt, however futile it may seem, at giving users some choice.<p>It's true a good portion of the web still works well without Javascript.  This seems like a good thing as Javascript can be a mixed blessing.  Enabling it comes with both benefits and risks.  Like cookies, a user could selectively choose which scripts to allow, one at a time (remember the embedded Java applet days?), but this can quickly become more trouble than it's worth.<p>Perhaps a difference of JS from cookies is that with Javascript the user might sometimes see what the actual benefits are and they might be more enticing than those of cookies, e.g., ""To see this cool doodad, you need to enable Javascript.""  It is very clear what the benefit will be: the doodad.<p>Contrast this with ""To use this site you must have cookies enabled.""  Terms like ""provide a better user experience"" might be used to describe the need to enable cookies.  But the specifics are usually absent.<p>If all websites were reasonable, and no one abused their ability to manipulate and track end users, things like DNT would probably not be necessary.

4081345,comment,4080565,4080565,1,0,rauschma,,,"Thanks for writing about your motivations for going to JSConf! If I may, Ill describe my own motivations for going to a conference. I do so not to contradict your opinion, but simply to offer another perspective. For me, a conference has to do the core things well. Everything else I can organize myself  without the risk of someone else choosing badly for me.<p>- Destination: I considered both San Francisco and the venue to be perfect. For me, a destination mainly has to be easy to reach. Tourism is a plus, but ranks a distant second to the ease of getting to the venue. Additionally, San Francisco has the advantage that many important JavaScript people live close by which increases the chances of them speaking.<p>- Parties: Agreed. At least one evening event for everyone would have been nice.<p>- Food: Im a bit difficult with food, so I often buy my own and dont care about conference food much.<p>- Significant others track: Im single. As long as my money isnt spent to support other peoples partners, I dont have an opinion either way.<p>- Spectacles: Again, I bring my own, so I dont need a video game lounge etc. All of these things cost money.<p>- Free beer / drinks throughout the day: I am a beer drinker, but would only want a conference to serve alcohol in the evening.<p>- Schwag: please no. I always have an incredibly bad conscience when I throw away (most of) the stuff I get at conferences. After a certain point, one has enough toys, bags, pens and paper. That being said, a B2G phone certainly would have been cool.<p>- Community / Speakers: I like JSConfs egalitarian approach. Not sure how well it scales up, though.<p>The biggest problem with JSConf is that its nearly impossible to get tickets (I tried twice). So where JSConf wins with regard to its egalitarian speaker/audience approach, it loses with regard to tickets, where it can feel a bit elitist: Some people will easily get a ticket, others wont.<p>You might completely disagree with my taste as outlined above, but then the conclusion is easy: The JavaScript community can only profit from the increased conference diversity that is currently developing. In my opinion, Fluent should mostly stay as it is, as probably should JSConf (which I havent been to, yet).",1339103341

But is it so much worse than having every company Jack store passwords in $non_crypto_hash_system?<p>(begin-rumination....<p>Right now, compromise risk for credentials typically lies on the companies. They frequently fail in protecting these credentials. However, your credentials are - inadvertently - distributed out between multiple companies. When one goes down, the other credentials are considerably less affected.<p>(More so if you've been bad and used the same password everywhere).<p>Examining a local store, we centralize risk onto the local desktop. Suppose that in order to log into the user's central system, the user had to provide a password. (Example: gpg-agent). Then, to log into a remote system (web, ssh, etc), the user's credentials get passed into the remote system via some well-known private/public authentication scheme.<p>Points of failure here:<p>- user forgets own password. All credentials are lost until they manage to get reauthenticated into the system.<p>- Malware hacks the user's keystore and uploads private keys to $malware_database. Case 1: in-memory hack. Case 2: hacks system database.<p>- Case 3-ish. Malware injects dialog requesting system password and gullible user enters it. Upload commences...<p>I am sure other scenarios can be imagined.

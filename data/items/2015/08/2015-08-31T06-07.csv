(ie. calculate the conditional probability P(X|H)).<p>I don&#x27;t really agree that your die experiment is well-formed. For one, you are grossly under-sampling. It&#x27;s known a priori that there are at least six possible outcomes, yet you are only considering three rolls, so you don&#x27;t even have the possibility of observing each distinct value even once.<p>The p-value of a well-formed experiment should converge towards a fixed value as more observations are made. You will experience variance in the computed value due to the inherently discrete nature of experimentation. This will be especially pronounced for the first observations that are made.<p>I do not know if the Higgs boson experiment is well-formed. If it is well-formed and their null-hypothesis is true, their p-values will trend towards 1.<p>If their null-hypothesis is not true then the p-values do not mean much and will trend towards 0.<p>>In this context, reproducibility means &quot;finding the Higgs boson again if the experiment is repeated&quot;<p>&quot;The Higgs boson exists&quot; is not a valid hypothesis. Usually the null-hypothesis is &quot;the explanation is measurement/background noise&quot;. Since that is really the only valid null-hypothesis, it is most likely what they are using.",1441004267

Some bodies will be more inclined to store this than others, and store it in different places.<p>If you put in 3 gallons per day, and burn 4 gallons per day, there is a deficit, and the extra will be burned from stored reserves (stored fat). It must, otherwise the machine would be incapable of traveling the distance that 4 gallons requires, and would not function. When that runs out, you die (i.e. starving to death).<p>Yes, it factually has to be that <i>simple</i>, for all creatures, there is no possible other way. It is extremely simple science and logic.<p>Notice I said <i>simple</i>, NOT <i>easy</i>. They are two different things.<p>Also note that for all people the speed at which your body adjusts to eating less than you burn will be different, as will exactly how your body responds to your eating less than you burn. For example, if you seriously under eat calories, it&#x27;s widely accepted your body will think it&#x27;s starving to death, and will conserve energy it normally would not - i.e, you&#x27;ll be cold, your immune system will be weaker, your digestion will not be optimal, your hair and skin will deteriorate and not be replenished well etc. etc. So even though you&#x27;re eating less than you were burning last week/month, you might not lose (much/any) weight because your body has quickly adapted and changed the amount of calories required as best as it can by shutting down, or minimizing non-critical functions.
You could imagine an intelligent car doing the same thing when it realizes it isn&#x27;t being fed enough energy for the demands being put on it - it might turn off the air conditioning, lower itself, jack up the tire pressures, fold in rear view mirrors and limit itself to a top speed of 30mpg all in the name of more efficiency.<p>Source: I got involved with Weight Watchers years back - have personally been involved with literally thousands of people losing tens of thousands of pounds combined. WW is by very definition eat less energy than you burn.

Might as well throw in some Vikings ;)<p>Fair enough.<p>> Super interesting point about evidence of Polynesian travel in New Zealand. Now if there were some of that evidence with regard to South America, we&#x27;d be all clear. But there isn&#x27;t as far as I know, which raises even more questions about the sweet potato conjecture.<p>It would be rather easy, presumably, for the evidence of transitory usage to be destroyed or at least rendered indistinguishable by several hundred years of settlement. We have that problem in NZ - Maori legend speaks of the greate explorer Kupe who found New Zealand (Aotearoa) and returned to Hawaiki to bring people back. Nearly all Maori tribes claim to descend from an original migration canoe (waka) from Hawaiki - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Māori_waka"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Māori_waka</a><p>However, archaeologically, we can&#x27;t really tell where they, or Kupe the Great, specifically landed first - we can date earliest settlements, but how would you distinguish evidence of temporary occupation from evidence of permanent occupation?<p>So yeah, I would speculate that any travel to South America from Polynesia would probably have transited via Easter Island in the first instance - especially as it used to have dense forests before the Polynesian induced deforestation - thus making it an ideal staging post for resupplying by fishing and hunting, and providing materials to repair your canoes.<p>> With regard to the glacial maximum, nobody is claiming the oceans were plains to roam around. But a sea level 100 lower may uncover some new islands and make island hopping a whole lot easier. For example, Baral Guyot is a barely submerged island <a href=""https://earthref.org/SC/SMNT-257S-0866W/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://earthref.org/SC/SMNT-257S-0866W/</a> along the Sala y Gomez ridge and Nazca Ridge.<p>That is a very good point, I was only thinking Bering Sea-esque &#x27;land bridges&#x27; and didn&#x27;t consider seamounts becoming islands.<p>> Obviously there is no archeological confirmation of the conjecture I made, but that leaves both conjectures in the same uncomfortable spot.<p>The chicken DNA hypothesis needs more investigation IMO. Although it still leaves the question of the &#x27;navigators&#x27; vs the &#x27;navigees&#x27; unspoken. Who knows, maybe I&#x27;m manifesting extreme modern privilege and ignorance by assuming that seafaring was extraordinary to the Polynesians in the 10th century. It may well have been that contact between Polynesia and South America was driven from both sides mucking about in boats and having a great time. I guess I&#x27;m being a bit defensive of the Polynesians who were summarily dismissed by Heyerdahl - I hesitate to call him racist, but he overlooked what I consider to be an extraordinary amount of persuasive evidence that the Polynesians could easily have made the trip.<p>> This places the sweet potato travel around 1000 AD, which matches pretty well our conversation, but it&#x27;s definitely not evidence for &quot;first americans&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting time for it to arrive - Hawaii was settled in the 900s, so we can speculate that population pressure (or perhaps food pressure?) drove a wave of exploration and migration from Polynesia. Tying it all together :D Some of those explorers found Hawaii, and some of them found kumara and Mapuches. :D",1441003261

I am not making this distinction up. I am merely enforcing them as we do as speakers by the words we choose, based on the accuracy of our expressions.<p>From Popper:<p>> A theoretical system may be said to be axiomatized if ... (d) necessary, for the same purpose; which means that they should contain no superfluous assumptions [0].<p>So either Popper is wrong, or theories should not include unnecessary assumptions. But how do we know if an assumption is necessary without doing the science? And after we do it, are we still going to call necessary assumptions assumptions, even with its subjective implications? Only a person is capable of assuming. A theory with assumptions is still subjective.<p>A premise on the other hand is objective and specific. It&#x27;s &quot;a proposition supporting or helping to support a conclusion&quot; [1]. It&#x27;s a simple device in logic that asserts a dependency. Or in other words, a &quot;necessary assumption&quot;.<p>So then would it not be <i>safer</i> to say axiomatized theories have premises, not assumptions? And in Popper&#x27;s words, yet to be axiomatized theories have assumptions. That is what makes them hypotheses. And so all the words and their distinctions fall cleanly into place (I did not make anything up).<p>The original article in Nature was written on the <i>premise</i> that science is based on assumptions and that scientists doing the science rely on assumptions. This is not the premise of science, and is incorrect. Refining our word selection to reflect this understanding would be of great service, particularly to the students.<p>--

Everybody is gathering data.<p>They are doing it because they know they will have gathered the things needed to answer hard questions in the future they won&#x27;t even know they will be asking.  Not to mention the ones they know they will be asking.<p>Seems to me there is a lot of value potential inherent in all of that activity.  We are likely to benefit overall.  Question is whether the benefit will be outweighed by abuses.  I don&#x27;t know.<p>(And I&#x27;m still not sure I care)<p>2.  I&#x27;m on a startup type project now, and I&#x27;m first in line to suggest we gather data.  I want to gather that data because I know serious value can be understood and delivered by doing that and value added is the best way to make a nice profit.  There isn&#x27;t any reason to abuse anybody, but security is a liability and trust issue to deal with.  Hope it all balances out.  I&#x27;ll be doing my part in all of that, and the intent is good.<p>(and I do care very much about how that all plays out)<p>3.  With all this going on, how meaningful is it to me?

Maybe, just maybe, the compromise is more data logging.<p>Maybe the end game is we really can&#x27;t take general purpose computing away.  So we don&#x27;t, but the compromise is that we log the shit out of people in the hopes that we can catch the baddies and or keep them from doing too many things we don&#x27;t want them to be doing.<p>(and &quot;we&quot; there is in the most general sense as people for lack of desire to define that more precisely)<p>If so, fine!

My only real quibble is that I think the protein requirement is too high (even of lean mass).  Possibly I&#x27;m a special case, but 0.6g per lb of lean mass has been enough for me to gain muscle.<p>The &quot;ultra efficiency mode&quot; is definitely one of the more unfortunate things to come out of the low carb camp, IMHO.  generally speaking, unless you have a disease or physical disorder (like hyper thyroid) you are going to be burning/eliminating about 1400 - 2500 calories a day.  It can be quite a bit higher for some diseases or disorders where you can&#x27;t process food.<p>Running is a great exercise for counting calories because it expends a pretty predictable 80-110 calories per mile (depending on pace).  Other exercises can be extremely variable (to the point where I have seen people overestimate the calories by factors of 3-5).  Do not trust exercise machines for caloric output.  Every single one I&#x27;ve seen is off by at least 50% (they flatter you so that you demand their machine).<p>But generally speaking, if you do aerobic exercise continually for 1 hour, you will burn 5-600 calories.  If you eat 1600 calories, then you will have a balance of about 1000 calories, which will certainly be in deficit for the average person (if you are really small, then it might not be, but I suspect it will be even then).<p>So why do people hit plateaus?<p>- They vastly overestimate the calories burned from exercise.<p>- They vastly underestimate the calories eaten.<p>Mostly it is the latter.  It is not hard <i>at all</i> to put 100 calories of butter on a slice of bread.  It is dramatically easy to put 200 calories of salad dressing on a salad.  It is easy to say, &quot;I only had a muffin and a coffee for breakfast&quot; without realizing that said muffin (with butter) and coffee (with cream and sugar) could easily be in the 500 calorie range.  My friend used to go to subway for lunch and have a 6&quot; salami sandwich, one of those small bags of chips, and a sweetened iced tea for lunch.  He had no idea he was pushing 1000 calories for lunch (the muffin and coffee for breakfast, 6 inch subway sub for lunch and... sorry... maybe you can have half an apple for dinner).<p>So, it is quite easy to loose weight when you are 220 lbs and burning 2500 calories a day.  But then when you get down to 170 lbs and are burning 1900 calories a day, suddenly that miscalculation for how much exercise you are doing, or the 300 extra calories you are eating, but didn&#x27;t realize makes a massive difference.  Similarly, if you have health issues (especially digestion) that cause you to eliminate food rather than digest it when you are heavier, it can make a dramatic difference later if you get healthier and start actually processing this food.<p>The overestimation of exercise is a bad one because it is often fuelled by industry lies.  Go to a gym and someone will tell you that you are burning 1000 calories an hour lifting weights, or that adding a kg of muscle will increase your metabolism by 100 calories a day or some other such nonsense.  My brother (who is otherwise a very intelligent person) once thought that he could burn 1600 calories an hour on a bicycle (possibly if he is in the Tour de France, but pushing 150 watts is more than most beginners can handle for an hour and results in 540 calories an hour).

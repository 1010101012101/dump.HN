Any legislation of the internet to ""protect"" you from corporations will most likely include new and invasive powers of government to monitor and control the Internet (like SOPA).  No thanks.<p>Let's see if I understand this article though: I can pay $$$$ dollars a month for 250GB of <i>dumb</i> data transfer a month.  If I go over that quota, I have to pay $$$ more or I get shut off or slowed down.<p>But now Comcast allows me to pay $ to get an unlimited access to certain sites like NetFlix that would otherwise eat up most my ""dumb"" quota (if I watched movies all day).<p>That sounds good to me, I'd rather pay $$$$+$ than $$$$+$$$ for the 400GB of NetFlix traffic and 100GB of other traffic I use per month.<p>In a way, this is the market's solution to the piracy problem.  Licensed media sources are offered at a discount while torrent traffic is still allowed, but under general traffic prices.  Say what you will but, if the market doesn't create a solution, the government will and I guarantee you won't like their solution.",1332950386

They hate with an unholy passion having to upgrade boxes.  In this context they're basically trying to get the users to upgrade their boxes on their own dime. When I put on my consultant hat and talk to analysts in this area we've been talking more and more about how connected tv's and OTT Boxes can be beneficial to cable operators.  One of the downsides of cable cards is that you never got a guide with it. Combine a cable card and a Samsung Connected TV and you can really do both and get rid of the card all together.<p>Second they're quickly realizing that maintaining two on-demand infrastructures (Web and traditional VOD) the really sensible thing is to move as much as possible to delivering via your cable modem as opposed to the broadcast channels.<p>Of course as they do so they're going to have to do something about the bandwidth caps. Stories like this put Comcast in a strange position. They want to deliver more ""TV"" video content over their internet pipes but apparently can't do so and maintain a cap at the same time.",1332950266

Thus, a discussion about your argument is likely to devolve into long exchanges about children's rights and anecdotes about ridiculous edge case judgments on both sides.</i><p>I was careful not to discuss the validity of your belief, but merely to point out that your beliefwhether true or falseis not WIDELY HELD. And as you can see, at least one other person disagrees with you, and the resulting exchange is getting further and further away from discussing the original point.<p>When I use the words beyond dispute, I mean that people accept it as true, or a at least such a sufficiently large proportion of people that anyone disputing it is immediately understood to be ignorant or a crank. The Earth revolving around the Sun is beyond dispute. Although I personally believe that the evidence shows that punitive laws around marijuana possession are unhelpful, it isnt beyond dispute, lots of people dispute that opinion every day.<p>I stand by my assertion that if you say A -> B -> C and you choose an A that is not widely held to be true, you are going to spend a lot of time arguing about A even though your original intention was to try to convince other people of C. It doesnt matter how certain you are of the truth of A, what matters when trying to convince people is whether <i>they</i> believe it to be true.<p>If they dont, you either have to find a forum where people are discussing A, and talk about that, or pick another argument that is going to have a high signal-to-noise ration when discussing C.""",1332950158

The only thing that's different now from 30 years ago is that things have shifted enough that saying something sexist is rude.<p>Also, we may disagree on what's rude. If I throw a party and somebody is sufficiently offensive, I'll show them the door. If they see that as rude, then it's only for the same reason they were acting offensively: they were too clueless to understand the harm they were causing.<p>I agree that some people take it too far and are rude in return.

In simple terms, in this world there are always going to be temptations to travel down a road that in the end leads to death. In this case, it is eventual financial death for the marketer.<p>I know the temptation is for this road to be traveled because it's most often the easier road in the short-run for someone to take. There is no doubt in marketing a product or service that you are going to have to knock on many doors. Most often this will mean having to spend money in the process of running ads in order to get the word out. Bots such as those used by the Pinterest spammer automate the process but do so by taking advantage of loop-holes in the system and in so doing exploit whatever platform they are using (in this case Pinterest).<p>It is one thing to offer a product or service and to let people know about it and quite another to use technology to exploit a Platform for the purpose of sending unsolicited information to those who you do not know. There are better ways to market products and to profit from the sale of them through proven, sound marketing strategies.<p>The use of spam bots are not a reflection of anyone who has pursued an education of good marketing techniques.

I also don't see the stigma anymore among younger researchers; I detect that attitude from older people mostly, and some of the ""harder core than thou"" people in math-heavy sub-areas, but there's a bigger mix of preferences among people under 35 who work in less math-y areas. I use TeX myself when it's my choice, but I've collaborated on Word papers as well, if I wasn't the primary author/instigator, and it seems common/expected these days. Especially if someone from industry has been the instigator (e.g. on DARPA-contract type research), or if it's interdisciplinary with someone not from CS/math, they've preferred Word.<p>AAAI, IJCAI, and AAMAS now provide both options, and my informal observation is that more Word papers are being submitted than used to be the case, especially but not exclusively when it comes to authors from industry. CHI recently officially deprecated LaTeX as a supported option, but still provides the old (no longer maintained) stylesheets as a courtesy. Several universities (e.g. Georgia Tech) have also stopped officially supporting LaTeX stylesheets for theses and moved to Word as the only official option, though they do distribute student-edited LaTeX stylesheets as a courtesy. I assume that one's because nobody in the IT department knows how to edit the stylesheets.

You should definitely read the details as Adobe explains them here: www.adobe.com/go/fpl and here: <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/premium-features-licensing-faq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/premium-fea...</a> The short version is that Adobe is introducing a new revenue share licensing model where they will take a revenue share from some content publishers.
Adobe will charge publishers 9% of only the revenues directly caused by the game which exceed $50K.
If revenue is not directly caused by the game you pay nothing. i.e. An online teaser level for a iOS / Android game, a car company having a realtime 3d demo of their newest model which you can inspect and drive around, a 3d walkthrough for a library, etc, all would not pay the revenue share.
We see this as Flash positioning itself alongside other well known distribution channels: make money through the App Store, Apple takes a share. Make money through the Android Market place, Google takes a share. Make money through Flash, Adobe takes a share.
Its also worth noting that the new Adobe license will prohibit scenarios where youd have the first level of a game in the Flash Player, and the full experience inside the Unity Web Player. Alas, this is something youll need to be aware of if you were considering such a route.</i><p>You see, Flash is <i>not</i> web technology.Neither is iOS, or Android. Flash <i>was</i> web tech, a long,long time ago, but frankly the web hasn't evolved fast enough to keep up. HTML5 is still nowhere close to flash. WebGL is, but that's not exactly standard.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blogs.unity3d.com/2012/03/28/unity-flash-update/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.unity3d.com/2012/03/28/unity-flash-update/</a>",1332949550

If you look at the Agile Manifesto, the focus is supposed to be on a) people, b) shipping working software, c) collaboration, and d) being adaptable. That is sure not what it has become.<p>In my view, we made a crucial mistake: we didn't think about money and power enough.

So those differences in costs can be reflected in their respective prices and that's fine. [1]<p>Net Neutrality concerns come into play if/when Comcast is allowed to set additional arbitrary restrictions on competing services, to make its own offerings more effective.  Either by deprioritizing Netflix traffic in favor of its own, interfering with packets connected to services or protocols it would rather Comcast customers not use, outright blocking competing services, charging Netflix an additional fee above and beyond what a non-competing service would pay for a similar amount of packets, or any number of other nefarious schemes that the operator of a network could concoct to degrade the experience of competing services or drive up their prices.<p>Net Neutrality isn't about taking away an ISP's home court advantage.  It's about making sure they can't actively <i>sabotage</i> their competitors.<p>[1] Trick is: the difference in marginal cost is negligible compared to content costs. So there's no real room for Comcast to 'win' against Netflix on price-advantage alone.  Further, Comcast's motivation to violate Net Neutrality isn't to advantage its own IP VOD service against Netflix, but to keep the price of all IP VOD services high, to avoid IP VOD from cannibalizing the profits they earn from broadcast VOD. (Which are priced high because US cable operators often enjoy a local monopoly.)",1332948189

That's for several good reasons, partly that we like being special, but also because no one could really answer this without doing legal research in the jurisdiction where the OP was charged. The answer will vary not only from country to country but state to state, and could depend on all kinds of specifics we don't know.<p>With that said, the law is basically a big virtual machine that runs on metaphors and rhetoric, kind of like the IE6 html engine.[1] So if I don't know the answer, I look for a metaphor where I have a better intuition.<p>In this case, the post reads kind of like: ""hey, we all know that bar across the street is a front for organized crime. The law doesn't allow me to ask you to burn it down. So I'm just going to leave this molotov cocktail I assembled on the street here, and tell you not to burn down that bar across the street, OK? Also I've taken careful steps to conceal my identity. Laters.""<p>So my gut is, yeah, in the hypothetical world where the OP screwed up and a million people lost data on their computers, and the FBI went ahead and tracked the OP down and prosecuted, they would be guilty as heck. This is more than just suggesting that it would be nice if someone did illegal things (which could be problematic itself, if the speaker intended and expected the suggestion to be followed), but actually compiling and providing tools and instructions to make it happen.<p>But if you understand the situation differently, and can offer a better metaphor where they sound innocent, then the answer could change. For example, how about: ""hey, that guy is having a manic episode and about to start juggling chainsaws. The law doesn't allow me to suggest you use this tranq gun and shoot him. So I'll just leave it here."" Or how about, ""these parents are bringing back childhood diseases that have been gone for decades, because charlatans have scared them into avoiding vaccinations. The law doesn't allow me to suggest you vaccinate the kids yourself, so I'll just leave this vaccination candy here ..."" OK, that one's definitely illegal, but interesting to contemplate. It's a fun game.<p>The thing to be careful about, though, is to disconnect what you <i>want</i> to be true from what is actually true. Like in this case, maybe you <i>want</i> it to be true that the law lets you hack someone's computer to protect them, the same way it (maybe) lets you stun the manic guy. But if you know that part's not true, then don't fudge the metaphor to get to the outcome you want.<p>And I am not your lawyer, and this is not legal advice, and you should consult a lawyer in your jurisdiction.<p>--<p>[1] This sounds bad, but I actually think it's a pretty reasonable way to run a legal system. We define a fair system as one that treats like cases alike and different cases different. So the way to make that happen is either to write code in advance that handles every edge case -- which if you've met human beings is hilariously impossible -- or to analogize every new situation to the ones before, and try to fit it in where it belongs. It's a fun problem.",1332947751

The buck has to stop somewhere.<p>(On the flip side of the same law, a non-biological father would be awarded custody if they have formed a parental bond with the child).<p>Some more things to consider before you call the law ""anti-male"". One, if it were not the custodial parents, it would have to be the even more random taxpayers. Two, non-biological mothers pay too. Three, these laws are flawed for historical reasons, and these same reasons have impoverished  women far longer than men.<p>There are bona fide inequalities, of course. For example, men tend to pay significantly more child support than women.  However, given how men make more in general, even that still leaves men better off on average. For example, average income for non-custodial mothers is $15k/year, average income for non-custodial fathers is $40k/year.",1332946825

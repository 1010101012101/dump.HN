8239663,comment,8239328,8239525,2,0,angersock,,,"A much better read about gamers and what&#x27;s probably the big problem: <a href=""http://www.puppygames.net/blog/?p=1574"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.puppygames.net/blog/?p=1574</a><p>~<p>The posts you&#x27;ve listed pull in a lot of &quot;oh no 4chan is evil&quot; and honestly a lot of fear and victim rhetoric unrelated to the games industry proper--bad stuff, to be sure, but hardly limited to games.<p>It&#x27;s strange to see people being so shocked (<i>shocked!</i>) that many people are perfectly willing to be shitbags to one another, especially when the stakes are so low. It reminds one of interclique bullying of girls in school.<p>~<p>One of the biggest annoyances I&#x27;ve got is this notion in the articles of &quot;The games, they are more inclusive, more loving, more hugbox!&quot;. That&#x27;s horseshit.<p>Games in the 80s and 90s were more honest in some ways, more open in their characters and stories. MUDs and chatrooms and whatnot allowed people to play as whomever and whatever they wanted. Ultima Online, even old Zork...so much flexibility and promise. Once upon a time you could actually do serious academic anthropology on online communities--beyond, you know, optimizing marketing. People wrote essays about online rape, about offline death, about all sorts of things and how the real and virtual intertwined. It was a hell of a lot more optimistic than what we&#x27;ve got now.<p>That&#x27;s the problem: gamers are a hyperconsumerist group, and have become very sensitive (in some cases) to pandering and marketing...and when new games or titles spring up using inclusiveness or niche-audience or whatever as a <i>growth hack</i>, they are apt to call the games out. And this is a shame, because some games genuinely are trying to explore these places.<p>~<p>Another note on cultural identity.<p>Society has spent the last decade and a half alternately pushing socially-irresponsible games onto young men and then making them out to be manchildren if they have this hobby.<p>We haven&#x27;t made more jobs, we haven&#x27;t made less debt, we haven&#x27;t stopped marketing designed to pander to young men, we haven&#x27;t sought to constructively reintegrate effectively a lost generation of males into some magical new equality-focused paradise (which doesn&#x27;t exist, but that&#x27;s beside the point)...and yet, when we attack their last bastion of acceptance and belonging, we&#x27;re shocked (<i>shocked!</i>) that they become angry and fight back as best they can against some barely-understood antagonist.<p>I can not and will not defend individual acts of rudeness and abuse, but we need to do some serious thinking about the conditions that led up to this point--and the truth I believe lies more with consumerism, marketing, and societal pressure than some simple notion of &quot;gamers are finally getting the purifying light of ~social justice~ and crying like manbabies&quot;.",1409259514

He&#x27;s been criticized, even in Detroit, for buying them yet no one else was willing to take the risk.  Like most things only in hindsight does it look like he got a screaming deal.  Most of the knowledgeable real estate people are still unwilling to buy them and you&#x27;re worried about Gilbert getting a profit?  Note the Chinese are not only buying them but recently outbidding Gilbert.<p>A city comes back in spurts and not all at once.  After fifty years of trending down at an accelerating rate I&#x27;ve been arguing for several years no one in the press was seeing the story of the city&#x27;s revival.  Yet there are critics snarking that the entire city isn&#x27;t back yet. It didn&#x27;t decline equally and it won&#x27;t return that way.  All those high paying jobs that are moving downtown are also creating jobs in security, health care and restaurants.<p>If you look carefully you can begin to see it happening elsewhere.  Tear down those 70,000 blighted properties (which is beginning to happen) and you won&#x27;t be able to deny in a few years that its happening all over.<p>Detroit is Michigan&#x27;s Northern Star and until it returns to prominence neither will Michigan.",1409259395

Right now I see SumoMe as a great way to get things up and running, and pick and choose the pieces you feel you want. Super great service, fantastic team, products that just work.<p>OptKit has a different trajectory. It might look quite similar now, but soon things will take a more powerful and customizable turn. We won&#x27;t be offering more &quot;widgets&quot; per-say, but we will be constantly building for a very specific goal..<p>This may sound a little drastic, but soon after a few more big pieces get into place, the next phase is going to be introducing real-time trained machine learning models, in hopes of finding some predictable patterns. This would mean we could potentially predict the conversion rates of a visitor, in real time.. In theory we can possibly achieve a 100% opt-in rate, if this is actually feasible ;)<p>I see OptKit becoming more of an automated personalization tool, as opposed to a simple widget. With a lot more emphasis on the segmentation, personalization, behavioral triggers, actionable analytics.<p>I want OptKit to become the data driven marketer&#x27;s dream tool.. Their swiss army knife. For example, our reports will tell you simple mean/median/mode of the temperature of your converted traffic. This might make it easy to extrapolate some really great tests at a glance at a graph.<p>Have a hunch? Run a test! Have a doubting boss?

Given too much freedom, I&#x27;ve seen designers and product managers derail entire development cycles. Compare a few days for a single designer against two weeks for even a small development team and not only have you lost an amazing amount of money, but the opportunity cost of not getting something into the users&#x27; hands and iterating on it is huge.<p>For the same reason I&#x27;ve also pushed for aesthetic changes to be moved to following iterations. If your wireframe is solid and agreed upon up front, then iteration can happen on both the development and the design side as you move forward. I think it&#x27;s alright to release something that isn&#x27;t fully baked because what you learn in the end is so much more valuable than trying to get it right the first time.<p>Bottom line: get something out the door and iterate. Too often people don&#x27;t do either. Either they try to perfect it and take too long to learn from it, or they push it out and move on to the next thing. Nothing is going to be perfect the first time, so just get it out there and continue to work on it.

(Apart from reliable knowledge of what you signed... did you make a copy before you gave it back?)<p>In my experience these types of agreements are usually very one-sided, except for the consideration they offer.  You haven&#x27;t mentioned any consideration.  I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s along the lines of &quot;I agree to sign this piece of paper and hand it to Human Resources director in exchange for... a paycheck.&quot;  The agreement you signed doesn&#x27;t grant you any rights, does it?  So what would you gain from having a counter-signed copy?  I don&#x27;t see where you suggested that it would allow you to assert any particular right at all.<p>I am not in California and I am not giving legal advice (as a non-lawyer, I can&#x27;t give legal advice, obviously.)  But, as a person who is relatively new in his career and still very low-level (not a Chief Officer of Anything, certainly) I have signed lots of things that I don&#x27;t precisely remember the content, which sometimes contained ridiculous language, and that I never kept a copy of, much less counter-signed.  I don&#x27;t lose any sleep over it.<p>That being said, if you have signed some non-disclosure agreements (and particularly if you&#x27;re not 100% sure of the content of those documents) you will understandably want to tread carefully with those written records and notebooks that you said you have.  Good for you, this is another place where I have failed.  &quot;Non-disclosure&quot; does not mean &quot;forget everything you learned.&quot;<p>If you think that you signed over the rights to some project which you had worked on prior to signing on and being an employee of the company (it&#x27;s not clear from your post if that&#x27;s exactly what has you concerned), you will want to talk to a lawyer.  Most of the time I think the boilerplate for these type of IP documents are not about accepting non-disclosure of those types of projects (which you own, unless there is also a bill of sale you haven&#x27;t mentioned), but _full disclosure_, eg. they don&#x27;t want to be surprised long after you are hired that you have and have always had relevant domain knowledge that you brought in from previous experience, that could be threatening to the company in the future.<p>So, hope this helps!",1409259031

But have you learned <i>why</i> those processes and approvals exist?  What events or forces led to them being instituted, and what sort of problems was the organization solving?  Have you learned how to figure that out, how to develop little birdies within the organization who will tell you things and keep you informed of office politics?  How to build a reputation for yourself so you can bypass many of the petty procedures?  These are critical skills that are much easier to learn in a big company than in a startup.<p>I would focus on learning the soft skills while you have an opportunity, and then jump ship once you feel that you know <i>how</i> to develop these soft skills, and that most of the remaining work you&#x27;re doing is specific to how things work in that one company.  Then use the skills you&#x27;ve developed to jump ship for a better opportunity.<p>As for how often is too often - it&#x27;s not unusual to have a bunch of jobs in your first few years out of college.  3 months is generally too short, though, if you leave after 3 months it looks like you&#x27;re superficial and can&#x27;t be bothered to learn anything in depth.  I&#x27;d stay minimum 6-8 months, maximum of about a year or two, for the first few jobs.

And a way to run small snippets of code quickly.<p>Tight security can be solved by some sort of sandboxing that takes a performance hit and a web of trust. Computers that ran the program can confirm that it is not malicious. Then an app can be run without a performance hit. This is the model of Apple&#x27;s app store more or less. Except it&#x27;s not a web of trust but a centralized authority and there is no way to run untrusted code.<p>And it makes a lot of sense.

I&#x27;d actually like to put a bench in my front yard, facing the sidewalk – unfortunately people would use it to congregate and drink.

For some reason <i>my</i> yard appears like a perfectly good drinking spot, I&#x27;m not sure why, but I am very aware of it.<p>When benches are put in by the city, the person who makes that decision is not at all aware of these specific issues.  They don&#x27;t live with the result of the infrastructure they create.  So we have another public bench near us that causes problems.  Or often there are no benches available because they are seen as a nuisance, or the public space is rendered hostile in some fashion to discourage loiterers, which simultaneously discourages all enjoyment.  These are the crude choices cities make because the people planning aren&#x27;t intimately involved with the specific environments they are affecting.<p>(If I ever do something with the hill in my front yard I think I&#x27;d like to install a slide.

So they went with Plan B, a public-private partnership with a company named Xtendwave, where Xtendwave worked with NIST to design a phase modulated signal format for WWVB, NIST implemented the new phase modulated signal, and Xtendwave filed for and received patents on it all.<p>So NIST is currently broadcasting two signals on WWVB&#x27;s carrier: the old amplitude modulated signal, which is prone to interference, and a new phase modulated signal that&#x27;s more resistant to interference and has error-correction built-in.  Unfortunately, when the phase modulated signal appeared, all of the &quot;laboratory grade&quot; carrier tracking WWVB receivers in the world (like Dave Mills&#x27; Spectracom receivers and a Kinemetrics/TrueTime receiver I had at ${PREVIOUS_JOB}) became instantly obsolete — they can&#x27;t lock onto a carrier that&#x27;s constantly, unexpectedly going 180° out of phase.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that Xtendwave has been saying that their line of receiver chips for the new phase modulated WWVB signal will be available Real Soon Now™ since at least late 2012, but you still can&#x27;t buy them.  Also, no one seems to know if you can build your own receiver for WWVB&#x27;s phase modulated signal without running afoul of Xtendwave&#x27;s patents.<p>So, yeah, NIST obsoleted working equipment actively used in industry in order to provide a &quot;better&quot; time signal that nobody can actually make use of.  Yay.<p><i>These four radios, together with a Heath WWV receiver at COMSAT Laboratories and a pair of TrueTime GOES satellite receivers at Ford Motor Headquarters and later at Digital Western Research Laboratories</i><p>GOES is NOAA&#x27;s geostationary weather satellite program, and NOAA used to broadcast a publicly documented timecode from those satellites.  NOAA finally killed the time service a decade ago because GPS existed, there was almost no funding to keep the GOES timecode going, and the ground hardware used to drive the service was obsolete.<p>There&#x27;s a nice GOES retrospective at <a href=""http://tf.nist.gov/general/pdf/2013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tf.nist.gov/general/pdf/2013.pdf</a>",1409257663

The compulsion to comment is trying to get rid of a feeling of irritation. That doesn&#x27;t work, because the other side—who are probably just as irritated as you are—push back harder, irritating you more.<p>You can interrupt this compulsion simply by feeling the irritation without trying to get rid of it or channel it into something else, such as a proof of rightness. The more aware you are of how it&#x27;s agitating you, the less likely you are to lash out.<p>It seems like being <i>more</i> aware of something <i>un</i>comfortable can&#x27;t help, but in pratice it does. It helps the irritation subside and softens the habit for next time.<p>This has given me a new perspective on tolerance. Tolerance is closer than we realize to the physical sense of &quot;to tolerate&quot;, i.e. to bear a pain or stress internally without snapping. This capacity increases with practice. I&#x27;ll add one tip, though I fear it will sound incoherent here: the best thing for tolerance is to experience the irritation, that buttons-being-pushed feeling, as a physical sensation and not an intellectual reaction.

8239394,comment,8239129,8239266,9,0,reasonattlm,,,"The cost of this would have been much greater, and present organizations are not really set up to transport people already cryopreserved, so doing it ad hoc would be especially expensive. Transport when it does happen tends to be a packaged in dry ice type of deal, with final procedures happening on site on arrival, potentially a day or two later in the case of long distances. Alcor recommends that those who can predict their end of life date with any accuracy move to be close to their HQ. A good cryopreservation, all other factors being equal, is all about time to fully vitrified for important tissues. Regulation makes that enormously difficult on one hand, but transport is also a real logistics hurdle.<p>Also, in Finney&#x27;s case the condition he suffered allowed for more self-willed timing in these matters than is usually the case. It isn&#x27;t a pleasant thing to have to do to yourself by any means, but that is what it comes to when it is government employees who are the people who decide on every aspect of your life, not you. One recommendation from people in the cryonics industry in the past has been that when you are on the final downward spiral to stop eating and drinking so as to time the end yourself and thus ensure much better odds of a good preservation, organized and timely. Very rational, as the time from death to vitrification is so very critical, but again something forced upon people by uncaring bureaucrats and laws that prevent self-determination in end of life decisions.",1409256274

It can be manageable if the organization is relatively flat, but that&#x27;s almost never the case in government.<p>What eventually happens is that to give oversight to the decision makers on a sufficiently large project, your dev leads spend all day in status update meetings with scrum masters, who spend all day in status update meetings with project managers, who spend all day in status update meetings with directors and functional leads. Decisions are made a level above that, so you&#x27;ve got 5 levels of management in a big game of telephone.<p>It&#x27;s still probably better than the alternative, but Agile doesn&#x27;t give you the certainty around schedule and budget that waterfall does. There&#x27;s a mindset in the government that often manages around schedule and budget ONLY; so it will take rooting out several generations of government project managers to really start to crack the problem.<p>Like I said, I don&#x27;t envy the guy.

However, at the moment the focus seems to be primarily on social media interaction and optimization. This is all well and good, but I would love to see more integration with the features of my Android device.<p>At this precise moment an example is not jumping to mind, but I know several times now I have seen a trigger option in the list that I could make use of but could not find listed the universal Android feature I wanted to use as the resultant action.<p>Conversely when trying to create rules for something like having my phone muted in a specific location I had to create two triggers: First a trigger to mute my phone upon entering a location and Second a trigger to turn volume up upon leaving a certain location. Standing back to look at what I was trying do it is easy to understand that yes there are two Ifs that I want my phone to react to (entering an area and leaving it) but having the option to choose &quot;while in area&quot; or &quot;while outside of area&quot; would be great. I think this comes down to a difference between literal if This action then That action and if This idea then That action.<p>IFTTT is clearly programmed how it operates rather than how people tend to think. As someone that has done programming, I get that and can work with it, but it doesn&#x27;t seem the ideal model for use by the average person.<p>All this having been said I think it is a fun, wonderful gadget and I look forward to seeing how it grows.

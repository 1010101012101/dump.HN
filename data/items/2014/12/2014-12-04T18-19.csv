Say you have 10,000 listeners and you randomly assign each one to 16-bit vs 24-bit listening.  You have enough listeners that any differences between the groups are due to chance and will very close to even out.  Now, if you find people are unable to distinguish between 16-bit and 24-bit you might want to try the test again with more control over the environment, but if you find a substantial difference in a large blind randomized test that&#x27;s a real finding.",1417719596

> joining in the hatred hive mind fostered by the media?<p>Pretty strong words on your part as well, but whatever, I&#x27;ll answer. No, I decided a while back that if I ever need a ride, it won&#x27;t be in an Uber car. This decision was based not only on what&#x27;s in the regular media, but from reading personal experiences of riders and drivers in forums like this and larger media like Facebook and Twitter. I&#x27;ve read a few good, positive things about Uber in the past few years, but as a whole I consider them to be hostile and extremely slimy.<p>Simply put, I formed an opinion, as is my right, and it&#x27;s a strong opinion so I use strong words to convey it.",1417719560

A C project needed a parser, so I decided to whip it up using Lex and Yacc.<p>Since the whole thing is logically a module, I decided to call the files:<p><pre><code>  parser.l parser.y parser.c
</code></pre>
The .l has the lexer, .y the parser, and the .c file some supporting common code.<p>In the Makefile, the rules were like this:<p><pre><code>  OBJS := [...] y.tab.o lex.yy.o parser.o

  y.tab.c: parser.y
          $(MY_YACC) ...

  lex.yy.c: parser.y
          $(MY_LEX) ...

</code></pre>
Things were coming along fine, until I updated the parser.y file so that it was newer than parser.c, and ran make.<p>Little did I know that make has a built in rule which looks something like this:<p><pre><code>  # make .c file from .y file
  .y.c:
          $(YACC) $(YACCFLAGS) $< > $@
</code></pre>
Of course, parser.o depends on parser.c, so has to be rebuilt. But parser.c, through the built-in rule, depends on the newer parser.y.<p>To my dismay, the build failed with warnings about missing and duplicate symbols. What?<p>I went through the make output, and saw the following:<p><pre><code>  yacc parser.y > parser.c
</code></pre>
I rubbed my eyes, shook my head, but it was still there: the module of supporting C routines is gone, clobbered by the generated parser that should only go into y.tab.c.<p>I reported this to the GNU Make bug database and was informed that a .y to .c rule is a POSIX requirement, believe it or not, so they can do nothing.<p>You heard it: POSIX stupidly requires make to have a built-in rule which has .c files as its <i>target</i>.<p>After that I stopped trusting built-in rules. Who knows what else is in there? And how it varies between different make programs and their versions? Even if the contents are otherwise harmless today, maybe that will change in the future if some new, potentially dangerous item is added again.<p>The way you get rid of all of them is an empty SUFFIXES rule:<p><pre><code>  .SUFFIXES:

8700831,comment,8700554,8700554,0,0,DAddYE,,,"So for those who wonder:<p><pre><code>    In the TC meeting today we came up with a vision for the first release.

    First, a few assumptions we&#x27;ve internalized that probably need to be stated for this to make sense.

    - Node is pretty damn stable already. There are huge companies with it in production, 100K+ modules, etc. It is already far more stable that its pre-1.0 release tag suggests.
    - Releasing more frequently leads to a more stable product, not a less stable product.
    - The entire ecosystem uses semver while node uses a confusing even/odd release structure.

    If people disagree with any of those assumptions then they certainly won&#x27;t agree with anything the TC determined for the initial release.

    So, first release of io.js:

    - January 13th (Fedor&#x27;s Birthday!) target date.
    - Will be 1.0-alpha1, with alpha releases continuing until 1.0.0.
    - Switching to semver.
    - We will be taking new v8 releases as fast as possible moving forward.
    - Trying to get to a weekly release cycle. Which version number is incremented each week is determined by the changes and whether or not they are breaking. Again, following semver.

    Some questions still left open:

    - Are there any changes other than dep upgrades and fixes required for 1.0?
    - Is build confident we can have enough automation in place to hit this date.
    - Is the plan to have the installer install an iojs binary and an alias to node?

Just dispassionately state what led you to the decision to fork, and that you mean no ill will toward the project from which you&#x27;re forking. Assuming that you do consider it a fork (as opposed to an emergency preservation of the original project), emphasize that you&#x27;re forking the code and not the name, and choose a name that does not conflict with the project&#x27;s name. You can use a name that contains or refers to the original name, as long as it does not open the door to identity confusion. Of course it&#x27;s fine to explain prominently on the fork&#x27;s home page that it descends from the original program, and even that it hopes to supplant it.

I&#x27;ve followed Matthias&#x27; project as I&#x27;ve tried learning the Play framework as well as front end development, and it has been incredibly useful. Incidentally, I learned Scala after I knew Clojure reasonably well, and I feel like I could apply the same arguments in the reverse direction.<p>When it comes to the back end, I&#x27;ll likely choose Scala 100% of the time. I really believe there is no substitute for a strongly typed ML-derivative for that type of environment. Additionally, there are a strong set of robust scala libraries (Typesafe mostly) that are completely production ready, and java interop is much more natural when you need it.<p>For the front end, I&#x27;m currently using Javascript, but I have toyed with the idea of both Scala.js and Clojurescript. This is where Clojure really makes me mad. I feel as though the dynamically typed Clojurescript should be a better fit as a compile-to-javascript language, but in every instance I&#x27;ve tried, Scala.js just works better. It compiles correctly, error messages make sense, much better documented, and there are fewer deviations from the core language. And the clojurescript libraries are mostly terrible in this regard...even the super-hyped ones like Om. My biggest pet peeve are the tutorials that force you to learn unrelated things (like Datomic, Emacs, Ring, etc) to be able to walk through them. I really feel like Clojurescript had a chance to shine here, but I find it far less inspiring than the relatively immature Scala.js. Oh well.",1417716912

Yes, the characters and art were not as cute (although personally I actually prefer leaving crushed bloody corpses behind instead of merely displaced living pigs...), but it took me just a few minutes to completely forget about that. When playing either game, I&#x27;m not spending my time admiring the art...I&#x27;m looking at how the structure reacts to my shot and figuring out what I have to do next to complete the destruction.<p>What stopped me from buying CtC was aiming. Angry Birds uses a slingshot, so I can pretty easily set the angle of my shot. CtC uses a trebuchet where the player selects the release point after the trebuchet is in motion. Getting a specific angle becomes a test of figuring out the right release point, and then getting the timing right to tap at just the right time.<p>Worse, with Angry Birds I can zoom out if I want so that I can see the slingshot and the target at the same time, which helps in figuring out the angle I need and the force I need. With CtC, you cannot see the trebuchet and the castle at the same time. Making that even more annoying, when the shot is in flight the camera uses a close up on the shot so you cannot see the in flight shot and the castle at the same time. You don&#x27;t see them together until near the time of impact. This makes it harder to decide what correction you need to your timing.<p>The result is that Angry Birds for me is the more cerebral game. I want to concentrate on the physics problem of determining the weaknesses of the structure and where to apply force and how much to achieve that. The gameplay does not get in the way of the structural physics game. With CtC, there is this annoying reaction time game (timing the release tap) that gets in the way of the physics puzzle at the castle, and the annoying camera adds needless difficulty, and so although I enjoyed it enough to play all the way through the free version, I did not open my wallet to continue.",1417716833

8700659,comment,8699845,8699845,0,0,noelwelsh,,,"On Monday I&#x27;m giving a talk at Scala Exchange on my take on idiomatic Scala. For those of you who can&#x27;t make it, I&#x27;ll give a quick rundown. You basically need four patterns:<p>- algebraic data types<p>- structural recursion<p>- fold, map, and flatMap<p>- type classes<p>That, in my experience, will cover the majority of code you need to write in Scala and give a solid basis for a robust and comprehendible code base.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that in Scala algebraic data types and type classes require a bit more code than in most other functional languages.<p>E.g.<p><pre><code>   sealed trait Foo
   final case class Bar(...) extends Foo
   final case class Baz(...) extends Foo
</code></pre>
vs something like<p><pre><code>   data Foo = Bar ... | Baz ...
</code></pre>
for an algebraic data type, but it&#x27;s really not so onerous to type.<p>These patterns are really truly shockingly simple to use. We teach them in introductory courses and the majority of people get them.<p>It&#x27;s true that Scala has some warts, but as software engineers we ought to make decisions based not on our personal biases but on a consideration of the problem domain and tradeoffs involved. If you want 1) static typing, 2) a modern language, and 3) JVM compatibility then Scala is the best choice at the moment IMO. Remove one of those restrictions and other choices come into the picture.<p>Update: If you&#x27;re interested in learning more about these patterns, on Friday we&#x27;re going to send a free excerpt of our &quot;Essential Scala&quot; book to our mailing list.

8700627,comment,8697772,8699627,0,0,nicklaf,,,"The difference is the emphasis: mathematicians focus on proofs, and therefore have to write proofs of theorems that ensure their validity in all cases.  Many of these cases are what physicists would call &quot;pathological&quot;, and so they basically ignore them when introducing calculus as a tool for students of physics.  If you read the table of contents of virtually any book that professes to introduce the  &quot;mathematical methods of physics&quot;, you will see how different the emphasis is.  Since the physicist doesn&#x27;t care about proofs that involve concepts beyond basic plane geometry and high school algebra, s/he spends a bunch of time introducing a large number of techniques that use no more than algebraic manipulation and limits.  You&#x27;ll find a laundry list of topics, including: tricks of differentiation and integration, the basics of vectors and multivariate calculus (more or less in order to introduce Maxwell&#x27;s equations), specific examples of Taylor expansions and infinite series (in order to provide asymptotic approximations of functions--usually solutions to differential equations which represent the physics problem you are seeking to solve--which otherwise are unwieldy or impossible to carry out algebraically), some concepts and formulas from &quot;complex variables&quot; (which is a very deep and beautiful subject when studied more systematically, but is also so useful to physicists because of its connection to infinite series, and hence to differential equations), and &quot;special&quot; functions (which may be thought of as important classes of series solutions to differential equation), and most importantly, a little bit of linear algebra theory, which more or less places the majority of these computational tools in a unified framework.  (Later on, physicists make use of the an analog of linear algebra, attempting to carry out similar computations in &quot;infinite dimensional&quot; spaces (Hilbert spaces instead of vector spaces), in a subject that mathematicians call functional analysis.  Understanding the computational parts of functional analysis is essential for physicists who desire to take their knowledge of problem solving from the domains of mechanics and E&M, and apply them to problems in quantum mechanics, which is founded on functional analysis, and is in large part responsible for the extent to which the subject itself was developed).<p>The reason the physicist is able to succeed in so completely developing these tools (without even proving any of them) is because s/he is constantly testing their efficacy by trying them out of physics problems.  The life of a physics student is more or less an endless game of trying difficult problems, and then invariably ending up resorting to finding approximations in almost all cases.<p>You might say, then, that where the mathematician spends his or her time looking for watertight proofs of pure concepts about space, logic, and number, from first principles, the physicist spends an equal amount of time thinking about how to approximate differential equations.  It&#x27;s not too surprising that, while in theory there is a great deal of overlap, in practice, the styles of thinking are very different.  Part of this is because mathematics is such a vast subject, with more branches than one can care to count, whereas the number of branches used by physicists can more or less be counted on one hand.<p>In order to go back to a time when mathematics and physics had not yet diverged, you probably have to return to the days of Euler, or even Newton.  If you read William Dunham&#x27;s excellent book, &quot;The Calculus Gallery&quot;, in the very first chapter, you will find a discussion of Newton&#x27;s very basic work on binomial series--something that physicists use almost every day.  However, as that book progresses (it goes in chronological order), once you get to Cauchy, who worked in the early 19th century, you begin to see mathematicians turn their focus to questions that no longer address computational questions that could possibly find direct use by physicists, but instead are more or less exist only in the minds of mathematicians.<p>There certainly is a branch of real analysis, called &quot;classical analysis&quot;, which tends to focus more on concrete examples of infinite series, which of course have roots in basic calculus and physics.  You can in fact prove a great deal of interesting things about specific infinite series, but you will not invent algebraic geometry or abstract algebra, or be able to fully appreciate the scope of modern 20th century mathematics, if you confine yourself to studying the properties of just one concrete object.  If you do, though, you will eventually find yourself studying complex analysis.  Somebody who takes this route--that is, to reject the abstract flavor of 20th mathematics--can learn a great deal about mathematics that also happens to be very useful to physicists.  On the other hand, you would be missing out on a great deal of fascinating connections between the abstract mathematics of the 20th century, and applications to problems in computer science.<p>On the other hand, if you really want to study pure mathematics, using proofs, you&#x27;ll have to be somewhat patient before you can see applications to physics.  These applications will come sporatically.  Right away, linear algebra is an example of a very basic pure mathematics subject which is absolutely essential to physics.  At about the same level is calculus and infinite series.  Then, in mechanics, you will probably encounter what physicists call &quot;analytical mechanics&quot;, which is an application of a pure mathematics subject called the &quot;calculus of variations&quot;.  Your understanding of this subject doesn&#x27;t have to be very deep to start using it in physics, though.  At a slightly higher level is complex analysis, which vastly improves your understanding of infinite series.  The next application I can think of is quite a bit more advanced; it concerns general relativity, and could be thought of as an advanced setting for multivariable calculus, but which is inspired by the beauty of Euclidian geometry.  I am talking about what used to be called &quot;advanced calculus&quot;, but now has many different names.  The key object of study is what is called a &quot;manifold&quot;.  A mathematician would call the subject &quot;differential geometry&quot;, whereas a physicist would emphasize the use of objects called tensors.  At this point, you will begin to see non-trivial mathematics being used in physics, but with the annoyance that physicists continue to rely on computations rather than complete proofs.<p>Interestingly enough, Michael Spivak, the author of the classic pure mathematics book &quot;Calculus&quot; (mentioned in this thread, by myself and others), is in fact somebody with an interest in mechanics, and happens to be one of the key expositors of differential geometry (see his 5-volume treatise on the subject).  To this effect, he has also written an introductory book on mechanics (and is in the process of writing a sequel on the subject of E&M), but with an emphasis and style unlike any mechanics book written for physicists.  The book is called &quot;Physics for Mathematicians: Mechanics&quot;.  It looks deceptively simple in terms of the amount of formula used; however, it will really only be appreciated by mathematicians who have studied some amount of differential geometry (I believe he says in the preface that it would be idea for the read to have read some subset of his 5-volume treatise on the subject).  Back in the `60s, Spivak also wrote what, for years, seems to have been definitive text on multivariable analysis and differential geometry for pure mathematicians, in a book called &quot;Calculus on Manifolds&quot;.  This book is quite difficult to read, though, and today, there are more friendly introductions that presuppose less mathematical maturity, and are less terse (although the book is still a classic).",1417716333

8700595,comment,8699491,8700362,0,0,robert_tweed,,,"Same here. However, I&#x27;ve also noticed Google starting to suck more and more over the last year or two. The latest trend is that it will blatantly ignore whatever search terms you enter, if any of the individual terms happen to be related to something that&#x27;s currently popular. It will assume &quot;you must have meant that&quot;. And I don&#x27;t mean when it spots a typo and suggests &quot;did you mean...&quot;.<p>Their index for a long time has not particularly cared whether a page contains the specific words you entered, so much as subject relevancy. However recently it&#x27;s got very aggressive about deciding what it thinks you meant, and ignoring most of what you actually typed. This probably works for a large proportion of searches where people don&#x27;t really know what they are looking for anyway, but it&#x27;s really bad when you are trying to locate very specific information, especially anything technical. It&#x27;s very much like a return to the bad old days of spammy, highly irrelevant results, avoiding which is the whole reason we all switched to Google in the first place.<p>What makes it worse is the gradual erosion of advanced search features, like the ability to quote an exact word or phrase to filter out results that don&#x27;t contain it. The fact that Google can&#x27;t handle special characters is a pain too, and makes searching for anything Clojure-related nearly impossible. And recently, their dropping of the extremely useful discussion search feature. If DDG introduce a similar discussion search feature, I will most likely switch a large proportion of my searches to them just for that, because it was a great way to filter out spammy results, when searching for things like product reviews and obscure technical things like error messages.<p>Nowadays whenever I run into a search that just isn&#x27;t giving satisfactory results on Google, I&#x27;ll give DDG and Bing a try. Unfortunately they tend to be equally bad, for different reasons. It&#x27;s a shame that DDG simply cannot yet compete with the scale and quality of Google&#x27;s index, because the general ethos at DDG to build search tools that actually work, is much closer to what Google was doing 10 years ago, before their focus started to shift in other directions.",1417716073

S-Corp can become C-Corp by mistake if you violate any of the restrictions.  It can't get simpler than that :)<p>Regarding the tax event during any M&A, I quote the following from Levin's book ""Structuring Venture Capital, Private Equity, and Entrepreneurial Transactions"" (page 301.2.2):<p>""An S corporation is a corporation and hence can acquire another corporation or be acquired by another corporation in a tax-free Code S368 reorganization.  In contrast, a partnership or LLC can not be a party to a tax-free reorganization.""",1193299454

You see that variation even within the US. Stanford students are more entrepreneurial than Yale students, but not because of some difference in their characters; the Yale students just have fewer examples.<p>I admit there seem to be different attitudes toward ambition in Europe and the US. In the US it's ok to be overtly ambitious, and in most of Europe it's not. But this can't be an intrinsically European quality; previous generations of Europeans were as ambitious as Americans. What happened? My hypothesis is that ambition was discredited by the terrible things ambitious people did in the first half of the twentieth century. Now swagger is out. (Even now the image of a very ambitious German presses a button or two, doesn't it?)<p>It would be surprising if European attitudes weren't affected by the disasters of the twentieth century. It takes a while to be optimistic after events like that. But ambition is human nature. Gradually it will re-emerge.""",1188525273

We are currently looking for strong hackers to co-found with us, if they like the idea.  We cannot, however, find anyone in the UK even remotely interested.  The concept of 'it's not what you do but when you do it' simply does not exist here.  What does the US have that we don't?",1188525128

48549,comment,48294,48460,0,0,rms,,,"I'm an undergraduate in college, studying industrial engineering. I ask myself regularly what the point is, because I have absolutely no desire to work as an industrial engineer. You may remember industrial engineers as the efficiency experts from films such as Office Space and American Beauty.<p>So I know the thing to do is to drop out and move to the Valley. But the only socially acceptable way I had to do that was acceptance into Y Combinator, or angel funding from someone else.<p>So for now, my company is in Pittsburgh. It's going to be really easy to ""not die"" because there is absolutely no way for my company to fail because we have no expenses. Unless we get sued and can't afford to defend ourselves. While we're not dying, we should start making money. So if we have enough revenue to support a Bay Area or NYC lifestyle, we would happily move the company there, regardless of college education.",1188524083

Now it is all startup -- so that is good.  <p>We gave up a lot financially to be here.  If you have kids and a family it does take a lot more work, but it is not impossible.

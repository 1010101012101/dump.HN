388981,comment,388704,388704,0,0,mdasen,,,"It looks like the methodology that they are comparing is very different.  The BusinessWeek article cites things like increasing numbers of people achieving in those subject areas.  The international surveys look at the average achievement in those subject areas.<p>To simplistically illustrate with made up facts:<p>Let's say BusinessWeek finds that in 1990, 5% of students achieve an excellent result in math and in 2000 10% of students achieve an excellent result in math.  That's quite an increase.  Let's say that there were 100 students and so the ""A"" category increased from 5 to 10 students.  Awesome!  However, that doesn't tell us what the <i>average</i> student is achieving.<p>The OECD and others usually look at the average (mean or median) achievement.  It is entirely possible that elite education is increasing while average education is decreasing.<p>To put this into numbers:<p><pre><code>  --1990-----------------2000--\n    A:5                  A:10\n    B:10                 B:10\n    C:50                 C:30\n    D:25                 D:25\n    F:10                 F:25\n</code></pre>\nIf you look at those two distributions, you can come to different conclusions based on your methodology.  By mean average, the US is declining from a 1.75 score to 1.55.  However, the US also has more achieving really excellent scores.<p>One thing to note about a study like this is that the United States tends to have more immigrants than other nations.  Immigrants are fine people, but they face disadvantages in integrating into a new society.  Often times there are language and cultural barriers that slow learning as, well, part of their learning is spent overcoming those barriers.  This could drag down average US scores in academics when comparing them to countries that don't have immigrants that might spend a lot more time learning the spoken language over studying math.  If you're dealing with two people of equal ability, but one has to study a second language to become fluent first, that person's achievement won't be as great (or at least will be delayed as they have taken time to study something else).  This isn't something bad about immigrants, but it does say that there might be biases in the results of a study if one group includes more immigrants.<p>There are also much greater selection biases in other countries.  Take France vs the US as an example.  In the US, most students attend a traditional high-school.  Yes, there are vocational schools, but those aren't stressed.  So, in the US, an academic test is likely to cover a decently random sampling of the population at any given age.  In France, secondary education is very segregated.  As such, it is possible that there is quite a selection bias for the exams between those that are studying sciences and math and those that are doing vocational studies in who takes the exam.<p>I do think the US should be doing more to promote math, science and engineering, but I wouldn't be so quick to say that the US is fundamentally behind.  The US education system does face challenges that many other systems don't - such as absorbing a greater number of immigrants, dealing with historical prejudices that have disenfranchised and disadvantaged many, and trying to academically (vs vocationally) educate the vast majority of our children.<p>I'm not saying that anything in here is correct.  I haven't studied international education enough to make any conclusions.  This is simply meant to raise the possibility that the statistics aren't the full picture.",1228672477

I think that this article should mention  that what is meant by VC is really ""VC for web companies"".  What I suspect will happen is that there will be fewer and fewer web companies (with good ideas and the need for large capital) that need funding, and it will make more sense for VC's to invest in startups that are in more capital-intensive sectors like energy and biotechnology.",1228672121

As far as i can tell, a majority of the students who plan on going into law stick with Political Science as their major instead of going IR.<p>Skimming the required courses for the prelaw program my college offers, the requirements for that are much more aligned with what's needed for a polsci degree then an IR degree. Theres only two classes from prelaw that overlaps with the IR requirements and one of em's not even being offered anymore.  Also, the polsci half of the department offers scholarships aimed at prelaw students specifically.  (Technically Political Science and International Relations are the same department here, though they have pretty different requirements and different people in charge of the programs)<p>To generalize the courses, polsci is more ""American political science meets history meets business with a dash of criminal justice"" while IR is more ""Global political science meets history with dash of anthro"".",1228671547

388968,comment,388485,388506,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The ""mood"" after a recession tends to last until about 4-5 years after the recession begins, assuming it's not a total bear market like the 30s or 70s were (in which case, it tends to last at least a decade).  People didn't really feel like we were out of the 1979 oil shock and 81/82 recession until 1984.  (Some of my earliest memories are from about 1984, and I recall my parents being <i>very</i> careful with money.)  They didn't feel like we were out of the 1991 recession until Netscape's IPO in 1995.  They didn't feel like we were out of the 2000 tech recession until FaceBook and YouTube hit it big in 2005.<p>So yeah, if you date this recession from late 2007, we've got until 2011 or 2012 before people really think we're out of it.  And that's assuming there's not a further shock, like an oil price spike, another recession (the 1937 recession hit right as people were starting to recover from 1929-1932, the 1979 oil shock hit just as people were recovering from the 73-74 recession), or a war.",1228671434

388964,comment,388704,388747,0,0,tokenadult,,,"It's often said that the countries that score better than the United States in internationally standardized achievement tests are only testing a high-ability sample of their population, while the United States is testing a representative sample. But this is baloney. One example of a webpage about this issue is<p><a href=""http://www.wgquirk.com/timss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wgquirk.com/timss.html</a><p>More generally, I know the assertion is wrong because I can read the languages of other countries and I have lived overseas and I have observed their school systems and how the common people of other countries live in daily life. Several of the newly industrialized countries of east Asia and southeast Asia have a much higher level of numeracy, such that algebra is a standard curriculum subject for all students in seventh grade, including the below-average students, and such that people from those countries think it is bizarre that American store clerks count out change from a purchase for their customers, as if the customers can't calculate their own correct change mentally. Simply put, the policy analysts and journalists who say the United States is behind other countries and thus behind where it should be (given the very large expenditure on K-12 education in the United States) are correct.<p>A good point made by a previous reply here is that sci-tech skill sets are relevant in more than just sci-tech jobs. It would indeed be good if more lawyers, physicians, business managers with business degrees, and technicians and industrial workers without college degrees had strong knowledge of math and science. That is what makes manufacturing successful in many developing, low-wage countries: the workers on the factory floor and their foremen have a basic level of technical skill that allows efficient manufacturing that can produce products with a finished cost (including shipping to distant markets) and level of quality that is competitive in international markets.",1228671206

The increasing mobility of the professional class means that more and more people aren't tied down to a central office.  Why not create intentional communities out of abandoned subdivisions, where young professionals could live and work with other young people?

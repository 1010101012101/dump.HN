You couldn't have an article that was made entirely out of links. Furthermore, the link does not immediately convey an idea, unless the reader automatically recognizes the link (not likely). Using the link to represent the idea is more efficient for the person providing the link, but not for the people being talked too, when compared to reading a summary of an idea with the link as a reference.<p>It reminds me of a Star Trek episode (TNG) where the captain is stranded on a planet with an alien who only speaks with references to his species' history (there was also some wild beast that was hunting them). The alien would only say things like ""Gesh, from Torrock,"" which represented a story about a warrior who faced a similar situation to theirs. That short phrase was the link, and it represented an entire idea, but to the captain it had no meaning, because he didn't know the story.<p>I suppose I should have found a link that describes what I just said.

Can code bare metal and understand the memory hierarchy well enough to know when that makes sense.<p>5. Can assess whether a problem is going to be compute bound or IO bound and plan accordingly.<p>6. May or may not write code that is easy to read (""maintainable""), but tend to write code that is extensible.<p>7. Understand caching, load balancing, and compression.<p>8.

I'm thus unsurprised that there is not a powerful Gypsy Lobby agitating for affirmative action benefits, or maybe some sort of foundation started by a wealthy Gypsy industrialist. (The punk band Gogol Bordello seems to agitate for Gypsy rights, though. It's a start!)<p>I've heard that the Chinese and Japanese immigrants in Chile and Brazil are also treated as 'Hispanic' for these purposes, even though they obviously don't need a leg up in such matters. The same source mentioned that the 'Mestizo' ethnicity covers what people think of when they think 'Hispanic'. Is that accurate? (This problem also shows up in racial crime stats; the FBI rather promiscuously mixes whites and Mestizos, so it's very hard to tell that, for example, white-on-black rapes are incredibly rare, at fewer than ten per year -- because Mestizo-on-black rapes are more common).",1207670672

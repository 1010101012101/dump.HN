One of the factors they look for is risk taking behavior (going to parties, taking risks, etc). Traders, on the other hand <i>should</i> be keen to take risks.<p>Of course, there's a lot of other factors the veiled questions look for (asking whether other people are dishonest, looking at attitudes towards punishment) which aren't related to risk-taking.<p>Ironically, having a harsh attitude towards punishment can indicate dishonesty, possibly because dishonest people think other people are only deterred by the penalties.",1340841593

You lose out on some APIs, but most of the best stuff is in the support libraries.

But there's no frequency on that graph where M (green) is active all by itself. So you've probably never in your whole life experienced a pure ""green"" sense input!<p>CIE takes this into account when defining visible color spaces. Since you have 3 ""primaries"" you would expect the colorspace to be bounded by a triangle, each corner being a pure input of each primary. But you can see here <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_on_Illumination"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_on_Il...</a> that the top green corner is missing. That's because there are no frequencies of light that would let you see any color that is ""greener"" or further toward where that corner would be.<p>OK one last thing before I get to my proposal :) Your eyes gradually adapt <i>against</i> the colors you are looking at. For example if you're wearing red/blue 3d glasses for a while, when you take them off things will look greenish out of the ""red"" eye and yellower out of the ""blue"" eye.

You're really only forced to use it to pay your taxes.<p>The capital gains tax is an effective way of discouraging anyone from storing their wealth in another asset. Say I had bought gold in 1981 because I (rightly) expected inflation to increase, then in 1986, when the currency had lost half of its purchasing power - and the gold I owned had consequently doubled in dollar-value - I would be legally required to give some of that money back to the government, making the protection of my savings' purchasing power very difficult (if I want to stay on the right side of the law).\nSo while the government doesn't directly force anyone to use their currency to store wealth, they make it less attractive to not do so. And I suspect these efforts would increase should we experience a flee from the dollar in the future.<p>Legal tender laws is another type of legislation that gives unfair advantage to the government's own currency.

4169677,comment,4163124,4166897,2,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"<i>I found it interesting that ChrisNorstrom can be happy when he reminds himself that he does not matter.</i><p>It removed the stress in my life. I was at a point in my 20s when my failures started to surface and I started realizing that my desires and dreams were likely to never happen. That's when I became aware that I was not going to accomplish 99% of what I wanted to do in life. My idea of happiness was riding so much on ""I have to accomplish ________"" that it just destroyed me out when I wasn't able to accomplish _________.<p>After Sleeping Awake the relief was almost immediate. The realization that nothing matters, and more importantly nothing that you do matters or makes a dent in the universe somehow took away all the stress of failure. Failure was ok because it didn't matter, success wasn't all that important because it didn't matter.<p>When you live your life with the mindset that everything you do will affect someone either now or in the future, doing anything becomes painfully stressful. Because you're afraid of messing up someone else's life. Weather or not you have children now will dictate weather or not millions of people will live thousands of years from now. All of that puts a tremendous amount of stress on me. The realization that none of it matters takes away the pain. Weather I have kids or not, in a few billion years the sun will engulf the earth and everything that humanity has ever built will be destroyed. It'll look like we were never here. No one will care. No one will miss us. We truly will not matter to anyone because there will be no one to even notice we are gone. As depressing as that sounds, there's an upside to it all. Live your life and be happy because you're only here for a short moment in time.<p>Also we live in a very connected world right now. And the human mind just wasn't made to live with that kind of information. Every time someone dies or is suffering we find out about it. Every war, every conflict, every pain, every bit of injustice is broadcast all over the world. It's inescapable. The more you know the harder it is to be happy with that kind of knowledge. The realization that none of those events matter takes away their ability to deeply hurt you.<p>The problem is I care too much, other people's problems become my problems. I'm very sensitive and extremely emotional. Which is why I avoid making friends with people. Their life and mine start getting intertwined and it just becomes too painful to go on. Same with family. Sometimes I like to fantasize that I'm the only human left on earth, everyones gone. Because I hate seeing unsolved problems, criminals not brought to justice, people not achieving their dreams (like me) or going through pain.<p>So with that in mind, realizing that none of it matters, is the only thing keeping me from going insane. It allows me to let go and be at peace with existing in a non perfect world.",1340838673

Titles mean very little in the early days when you're trying to launch a product. Everybody needs to be marketing, sales, product development, finance and legal - and of course the janitor crew.  btw, good content outweighs format any day...",1340838017

(Defining ""classical music"" as music roughly from 1650-1900ish). But it sounds like the author didn't really limit his analysis to cadences. My impression was that he just counted every chord that precedes a C chord, which even in classical music would include lots of non-cadential IV chords moving to I chords in the interior of phrases. For non-cadential chord progressions, I'd expect IV-I to be fairly common, though it's unclear to me that it'd be more common than V-I. I mean, just the coda of any Beethoven symphony alone would probably skew the stats in favor of V-I, generally. ;) So, I'd like to see the author clarify that.<p>As for the explanation, I thought it might have something to do with rock's origins in 12-bar blues (I-VI-I-V-I), though I know that pop has moved away from that considerably.",1340838004

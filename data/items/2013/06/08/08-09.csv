The second slide, which implies that the fact that the internet traffic passes through the US is relevant.<p>This implies that either some physical interception was necessary, either from outside the companies, or from the inside with their cooperation, or that it was legally necessary (on order to require the companies to deliver the information.  And yet it would seem like the issue of what the NSA could require US companies to reveal, is orthogonal from which traffic passes through the US, since in that case the issue would be what was stored on US servers.<p>2. The implied cooperation from the companies in the slides.  According to the Washington Post, the &quot;Special Source Operations&quot; in the logo refers to &quot;the NSA term for alliances with trusted U.S. companies&quot;.  Given this, and the use of the terms &quot;providers&quot;, it seems unlikely that no cooperation from the companies is involved.<p>From the above, I would propose that the PRISM scheme must involve some combination of physical interception, and cooperation from the companies involved.<p>For example, the NSA may be intercepting traffic then asking the companies for private keys for some of the traffic they intercept.  This would fit the above facts in that it requires the traffic to pass through the US, and also requires cooperation from the companies.",1370681364

5844351,comment,5838326,5838326,1,0,p_f,,,"Very interesting article indeed. Some time ago I made something similar for GameBoy games and ran into the same set of challenges (and ended up using similar techniques). The ROM is decompiled and translated into C code, which is then compiled and linked with runtime libraries. Jump tables and indirect jumps often need some manual fixing. I went up to the point where I can convert some simple games (without memory mappers) into binaries running on iOS and X. I did not have the time to document the tools but if anyone is interested to continue that work just let me know.<p>I guess one of the advantages of static recompilation is that you can port old games to new platforms if you hold the copyright of the game itself, but without running into issues with the manufacturer of the console (Nintendo)--but I might be wrong. You could also conceivably improve the game more easily during conversion (e.g., incorporate higher-resolution graphics). Finally, you could potentially have the resulting code distributed via app stores that do not allow general-purpose emulators.",1370681168

That is, the X server provided a mechanism for drawing on the screen and managing windows, but did not implement a particular policy for human-computer interaction. While this might have seemed like a good idea at the time (especially if you are in a research community, experimenting with different approaches for solving the human-computer interaction problem), it can create a veritable user interface Tower of Babel.<p>If you sit down at a friend&#x27;s Macintosh, with its single mouse button, you can use it with no problems. If you sit down at a friend&#x27;s Windows box, with two buttons, you can use it, again with no problems. But just try making sense of a friend&#x27;s X terminal: three buttons, each one programmed a different way to perform a different function on each different day of the week -- and that&#x27;s before you consider combinations like control-left-button, shift-right-button, control-shift-meta-middle-button, and so on. Things are not much better from the programmer&#x27;s point of view.<p>As a result, one of the most amazing pieces of literature to come out of the X Consortium is the &quot;Inter Client Communication Conventions Manual,&quot; more fondly known as the &quot;ICCCM&quot;, &quot;Ice Cubed,&quot; or &quot;I39L&quot; (short for &quot;I, 39 letters, L&quot;). It describes protocols that X clients ust use to communicate with each other via the X server, including diverse topics like window management, selections, keyboard and colormap focus, and session management. In short, it tries to cover everything the X designers forgot and tries to fix everything they got wrong. But it was too late -- by the time ICCCM was published, people were already writing window managers and toolkits, so each new version of the ICCCM was forced to bend over backwards to be backward compatible with the mistakes of the past.<p>The ICCCM is unbelievably dense, it must be followed to the last letter, and it still doesn&#x27;t work. ICCCM compliance is one of the most complex ordeals of implementing X toolkits, window managers, and even simple applications. It&#x27;s so difficult, that many of the benefits just aren&#x27;t worth the hassle of compliance. And when one program doesn&#x27;t comply, it screws up other programs. This is the reason cut-and-paste never works properly with X (unless you are cutting and pasting straight ASCII text), drag-and-drop locks up the system, colormaps flash wildly and are never installed at the right time, keyboard focus lags behind the cursor, keys go to the wrong window, and deleting a popup window can quit the whole application. If you want to write an interoperable ICCCM compliant application, you have to crossbar test it with every other application, and with all possible window managers, and then plead with the vendors to fix their problems in the next release.<p>In summary, ICCCM is a technological disaster: a toxic waste dump of broken protocols, backward compatibility nightmares, complex nonsolutions to obsolete nonproblems, a twisted mass of scabs and scar tissue intended to cover up the moral and intellectual depravity of the industry&#x27;s standard naked emperor.<p>Using these toolkits is like trying to make a bookshelf out of mashed potatoes.\n- Jamie Zawinski",1370680273

That&#x27;s what this story was about at the beginning - the government was indiscriminately collecting and possibly analyzing your private data using some sort of massive, sinister Big Data operation, the scale of which we can not even conceive, and these big web companies were essentially handing them the keys to their telecommunications networks and telling them to go wild. This has been downgraded again and again, now to a few websites constructing a &quot;secure mailbox.&quot; Most of us, including Arrington, know exactly what that means. A secure portal/mailbox is exactly what it sounds like: it is the equivalent of sending someone e-mail with a curated collection of data, except for instead of sending an e-mail you are posting it to a private web page accessible through some sort of authenticated login page. And if this data is only in response to a FISA warrant or subpoena and only regarding data posted by non-citizens, suddenly your outrage begins to look a little melodramatic, and what&#x27;s happening begins to look a lot like what we already knew was happening for years.

This was an alpha version we put together to see what type of response we got before we started to develop additional features.<p>@Adrianwaj - I dig your favorites video idea.  I'm going play with some interface designs and see what I can come up with.  You have a lot of great suggestions here.  I think we can incorporate most of them over time, but I want to avoid having too many features and making the app too complicated for the user.  I do appreciate all the great ideas.  Thanks!<p>@iwr - I was debating between wrapping the YouTube chromeless player in Flash or JavaScript.  To achieve a full screen button, I would need to wrap the player in Flash, but overall I much prefer working in JS, especially with the push towards HTML5 and CSS3.  You bring up a great point about dual screens.  I think as HTML5 develops, so will a solution.  As browsers continue to trend towards being more minimalistic maybe a they will soon offer a JS full screen mode.<p>@makuro - We have not developed the seek scrubber or volume control quite yet.  I wanted to see the overall response to the core application before I started working on those additional features.  I have designs for them though, so keep an eye on us.  ;-)<p>@iworkforthem - Thanks for the positive feedback!  I would love to use this interface to build out content channels for others.  You bring up a really good utility here.  Using the Data API we could easily grab all the videos from a certain user, and booya you have a custom channel.  Ping me if you know anyone who could use this.  vidi@vici.tv<p>@Vantra - Someone else mention that thumbs up \ thumbs down idea too.  We are essentially doing that with the next button.  We figured if you hit the next button the video was not engaging enough for you to watch all the way through.  We capture that data and consider it when choosing videos for everyone.  Our back end crowdsources what videos are the most entertaining using the next button and a few other pieces of critical data pumped through a some cool ratio analysis and comparison algorithms.  With this AI, VICI.tv will filter though YouTube and deliver better and better content over time.<p>Again, thanks for all the comments and keep them coming.  We will put in more features based on what people suggest the most.  Any questions, feel free to find us on twitter (@VICItv) or drop us a line: vidi@vici.tv.<p>Lastly, what channels are everyone's favorites?  I saw so many awesome ones pop up yesterday.

You can spend your time and money producing items that will do damage (e.g. units), or you can spend money on things that will increase your production rate (e.g. more barracks, hatcheries, etc).<p>Then there is a tech tree to factor in, how far up the tech tree should you go.  It's all about understanding how far up the tech tree you need to go.<p>Say you are facing an opponent that is going to rush with level 1 units, if you know this, you can build defenses at choke points that will cost you much less than his units will cost to break through.  At the same time you are rapidly climbing the tech tree to get more powerful units and spending less on the lower tier units.<p>On the other hand, if he has just enough units to bust through your defenses, it's game over.<p>That's how strategy comes into play in SC2.  Often part of your early game strategy is figuring out how to disrupt the opponents supply chain (particularly along their critical path) while continuing to increase your own production capacity.<p>Long post - but in general your economic curves are not necessarily the same.

Despite different brands offering different amounts of tar and nicotine most people stick to a particular brand and smoke a particular amount in a day. \nHowever for ecstasy the dosages may well fluctuate wildly. Obviously to start with it isn't habitual so frequency isn't usually consistent. Even with a consistent ""every Saturday night"" (probably the most common dosage) due to the struggles of supply and demand in a black market you will take different quantities of different stock.<p>I.E. One day you'll have rubbish ""Roles Royces"" and you'll have 6 of em, another you'll have some nice ""Mitsis"" and just take 3 and on other days you'll have an insane ""Red Tulip"" that was incredibly more potent than all the others so you only needed one.\nOf course the name never really means anything as you can have  both good ""mitsis"" and bad ""mitsis"".<p>Then there is also the case where the pill is actually cut with something else (pretty common I believe), perhaps a bit of ketamine or god knows.

If you want to make safe bets, pick one from the ""most popular"" chart that you did not list (JavaScript, Python, C#, Perl, and Ruby). However, some more exotic ones might be worth your time, too: Scala might become more important in the future, for example, as it offers concurrency support. Same for Clojure that has some popularity on HN at least. On Erlang I probably do not need to comment, either. An if you work Apple stuff, Objective-C, naturally. If you go into games development, Lua is an option.

1857286,comment,1856791,1856791,0,0,blahpro,,,"As a recent CS grad, this article stuck a chord with me. I wrote the following reply to the author:<p>--<p>Hey Dominic,<p>I’m a recent CS grad (2009) from ECS at the University of Southampton. Full disclosure: it goes against my humility to say it, but I would probably consider myself to have been a student who hacked around with a lot of technologies and concepts not touched by my course (and I think I’m considerably better off for it).<p>Not to blame the course, though — the course at ECS was amazing. We had our fair share of ""ethics"" and ""IT industry"" modules, although everyone admitted (lecturers included) that these existed mostly to appease the professional bodies. We were subjected to modules that sought to teach us Java, requirements gathering, HCI and project management, although these only made up a small part of the course as a whole. A sizeable portion of my time at Southampton was spent deep in the mathematics that vitally underpin the ""softer"" CS subjects, and the course was delightfully broad. We built compilers to parse abstract languages, learned LISP (much to the initial mindfuckery of my peers and I) and we all implemented a FAT12 filesystem in C from scratch. The latter required two 12–hour sessions in the lab, and I’m pretty sure that the vending machine was completely drained of coffee somewhere around 6 hours into the second day. We were taught and examined in gratuitous (but stimulating) detail on computational complexity, data structures, formal methods and the properties of fundamental algorithms, and the officially sanctioned languages used throughout the course spanned Java, C(++), C#, PHP, Scheme, Python, JavaScript, Perl and a handful of UNIX shells.<p>I don’t think the problem is the courses, I think it’s the learning style of many students and the sheer number of students that are encouraged to go to university just because it’s what they are ""supposed"" to do to get a job. Group work always frustrated me, as many of my peers simple wanted to learn the course notes verbatim so that they could regurgitate them in an exam.<p>Although it concerned me that many of my peers would one day be released into the wild firmly clutching their Java IDEs, there were a lot of really bright students on my course.<p>The thing that stops large companies hiring me is probably the abundance of truly awful recruitment agencies. Myself and many of the ECS–ers that I’ve kept in touch with are bombarded by 5–10 poorly written, unprofessional LinkedIn messages from recruiters every week. Today I received such a message that opened with ""Hi Darcey"". Classy. They all seem to want Java/C# developers and none of them seem to care about other technologies, or deem them irrelevant, or think that this sort of ""playing around"" detracts from your skill in some other proprietary technology on their checklist. It’s getting to the point where I’m only ""working"" (for money) around 40%-50% of the time. The rest of the time, I’m just sitting at home working on side projects to keep myself amused.<p>Many of my most talented coursemates are either now working on their PhDs, or working 10 hours a day on a soul–destroying graduate program for some faceless city financial institution so that they can retire at the age of 45, burnt out and sick of technology.<p>Sometimes I feel like I should just move to Mountain View or Palo Alto or somewhere else with a little Silicon Valley sunshine, but I don’t want to move away from my family, and my girlfriend is very happy here working for a physics startup. It bothers me how grey and soul–less the prospects appear to be for passionate British software geeks.<p>Perhaps I’m missing something crucial (or maybe I haven’t been hanging out with enough of the cool–kids at Silicon Roundabout) but where can I find great tech jobs in this country?<p>Ben",1288632539

I can honestly say that each year, the quality of the students coming in reduced (lower qualifications, less students with any Maths background for example) and in order to maintain pass rates, the university responded by taking hard subjects out of the syllabus.<p>The UK higher education system is a mess. Its designed to only work financially with a ridiculous amount of students flowing through it. You can't maintain that volume and also maintain the quality out the other end.<p>My PhD was the same. I honestly believe that the minimum quality of what I had to produce what much lower than it would have been a decade ago. PhDs are the new masters and masters are the new degrees.<p>Knowing people that teach in the most prestigious universities in the UK, I also know that this issue affects all universities in the UK.",1288631071

On top of that the system has three features that interact to give it its depth:<p>1) There are several opportunities in each game to sacrifice your rate of growth to obtain a temporary advantage in present value (ie. cutting workers to rush).<p>2) Because present value is multidimensional (you can't measure the value of a Zergling directly against that a Mutalisk), you can sacrifice your rate of growth or your present value in order to obtain a temporary advantage in what <i>kind</i> of value you have (ie. cutting units or workers to tech).<p>3) Information asymmetry. While trying to gain these mathematical advantages, one has to act on information that is increasingly out of date. One can not usually predict the opponent's exact present value and rate of change, but can only estimate ever-widening bounds on their values.",1288630995

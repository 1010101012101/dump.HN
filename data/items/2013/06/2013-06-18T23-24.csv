For example, by whitelisting syscalls, devices, hardware and network resources and access patterns, in combination with containers.<p>Most of the challenge is automating that process adequately, which is really nothing more than traditional code profiling meets existing policy-based kernel-level security toolkits meets containers meets development processes (ie. build/test/release).<p>After ~3 years&#x27; with LXC, I believe that most of the attack surfaces are reasonably well understood and/or not required for most code to function. Sure, there will be kernel-level vulnerabilities, but they won&#x27;t be exposed to such a broad range of userland applications. With security you also get so much more insight, power and predictability with regards to resource profiling than with paravirtualized solutions. Real kernel-level metrics versus load!

WLM implemented something like cgroups scheduling, in that existing utilization samples feed into future scheduling to ensure responsiveness and fair access to resources under contention.<p>I am intimately familiar with eWLM and I think it&#x27;s quite unfair to call it containers.<p>> It&#x27;s your turn to provide some citations. You could argue that the Linux kernel has failed to achieve good multi-tenancy support, but saying it hasn&#x27;t been designed for multi-tenancy just makes you look ignorant of the last five years of development on namespaces, cgroups, and general multiprocess resource scheduling.<p>I&#x27;ll give you a simple example.  Do dd if=/dev/sda of=foo.img (or even /dev/null) in one container and measure I/O performance in the other.<p>The page cache is a global resource and so far there is not way to isolate it within containers.  Buffered I/O is pretty fundamental to all workloads.<p>>> I&#x27;m quite sure it&#x27;s not faster than virtualization.

Juries aren&#x27;t judges or lawyers.

You are not required to have a license to be a passenger in a car on a public road.<p>When flying in an aircraft you are a passenger and therefore no license is required. But be assured that guy up front flying the airplane has his pilot&#x27;s license that shows they are capable of doing so safely.<p>When you are restricted from driving on a public road due to lack of a license that is society actively accusing you of being a danger to everyone else. The issue you are trying to compare this to are people being on a no-fly list that don&#x27;t know why they are on this list and no one will tell them.<p>That&#x27;s the main difference, the accusation. If the police were confiscating driver&#x27;s licenses from people and forcing them to walk instead of driving without explanation, then that would be the same thing.<p>Now, if you have a history of attempting to bring down airplanes while in flight while you were on board, then they could rightfully restrict you from entering any other planes. At least in that case there&#x27;s the accusation.<p>But I don&#x27;t understand your thought of being restricted without trial as a strange concept. It&#x27;s done all the time. Try to enter a restricted government building or a military base without permission and see how far you get. Even better, enter a stranger&#x27;s house and see what happens.

On the very first convoy an oil tanker was hit by an Iranian mine (luckily causing no injuries or loss of life). Later in the convoy operation U.S. special operating forces managed to capture an Iranian minelayer in the act of laying mines.<p>Later during this same operation, <i>USS Samuel B.

She had to limp out of the minefield on auxiliary thrusters while the crew fought to contain damage and save the ship. 10 sailors were injured badly enough to require evacuation. 4 of <i>those</i> were badly burned and had to be sent all the way back to the U.S. to recuperate.<p>As a result of <i>that</i>, the U.S. Navy launched a short surface operation against Iranian platforms (Operation Praying Mantis) on April 18, 1988.<p>Meanwhile, about a year before Iran Air 655, on May 17, 1987, an <i>Iraqi</i> (U.S. ally??)

So after they sent the password reset link, they called &quot;fetchUserIdByName&quot; again, but they passed in a username that had already been canonicalized once. Because of this bug, I wonder if password resets worked at all for users with unicode characters in their names.",1371596770

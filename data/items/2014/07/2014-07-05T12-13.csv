7991758,comment,7991458,7991458,3,0,goblin89,,,"> With Node you can literally share your code between the front and back of a system.<p>I think sharing code is dangerous as it tightens component coupling and makes architecture less flexible and more complex.<p>An average web project nowadays seems to be a back with many fronts: end-user website, admin interface, iOS app, Android app, Windows app… Making all fronts equal in their separation IMO keeps the architecture more predictable and easier to understand. Like DRY but with design decisions instead of lines of code.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t see how you can be flexible without making API the only point of contact for your back(s). That way you don&#x27;t lock yourself in and can rewrite any component with another framework or language, once requirements change sufficiently. I imagine it&#x27;s much harder to do if you have everything in one Node project.",1404564977

However, that also means that when there&#x27;s nothing to do, the majority of people will try to physically stimulate themselves because that&#x27;s all there is TO do. To say that we&#x27;re stupid because we would administer a painful shock to ourselves rather than sit in our own silence for 15 minutes is a very naiive way to approach the results.

Switching a language in the same paradigm is more like maybe learning a local dialect of dialect of English, new words, new pronunciation. Say you are moving to Australia from US, you might have that issue. But if you think it worthwhile it is an investment.<p>But that is for when the paradigm is the same. Object oriented, functional, dynamic types vs static types, logic programming, declarative (SQL) those are like different languages French, Spanish,  etc.",1404564895

7991753,comment,7987146,7991658,5,0,tjholowaychuk,,,"I think the issue is we&#x27;ve been slowly accepting that the node  is the right way to do things. Five years of working with someone will do that to you. If you follow me on twitter you probably see me complain about it in various ways all the time, it&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m bored with it, node&#x27;s problems are real and some people just seem to ignore them, or maybe just deal with them because they know backwards compat can&#x27;t be broken immediately. It has always bothered me that people would advocate such broken systems (streams etc) when real-world alternatives were better even before now, even C has a much better example of what a stream should be.<p>I&#x27;m definitely not the only one writing large systems, but I think the tolerance level varies per developer. Also plenty of people make a living/name from Node, of course they&#x27;re more likely to praise it than to be honest about its faults, I&#x27;m definitely a minority in that respect. Having broken concepts is one thing, but resisting change when they&#x27;re obviously broken is not a good thing. Many of these same people make money from consultation, where it&#x27;s advantageous to have a broken system. I&#x27;m not trying to screw them over but someone has to be honest.<p>It took years to get .addHeader() in because no one in core believed in a progressive API, they didn&#x27;t use node in real-world applications to see the need. This still happens all the time, take npm-www for example, Isaac is a rad guy but him aswell as most other &quot;core&quot; community members advocated building tiny little things and stitching them all together, and just recently realized that in practice this doesn&#x27;t scale, thus ended up going with Hapi. This lack of insight is all over Node as a community.<p>It&#x27;s hard to describe well, but I hope people will try Go (or similar alternative), you&#x27;ll really see how much more robust it is. If node fixed its conceptually flawed event system, rewrote http so it wasn&#x27;t awful to work with, and fixed streams then we&#x27;d have a pretty good system to work with. It&#x27;s <i>very</i> easy to pass off problems with node as problems you&#x27;d have with any platform, but that&#x27;s unfortunately just not reality.",1404564846
7991752,comment,7990191,7991029,5,0,Pacabel,,,"That&#x27;s not a very convincing example.<p>Let&#x27;s ignore the fact that it&#x27;s a trivially small example to begin with. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very representative of larger apps, especially ones that are far more complex than a very simplistic blog system.<p>And let&#x27;s ignore the fact that the SQL-based one is around 10% shorter than the MongoDB one, too, in terms of their line counts.<p>The SQL-based one makes the queries very clearly visible. It&#x27;s easier to find the queries, and for anyone who knows SQL it&#x27;s very clear at a quick glance what they&#x27;re doing. It&#x27;s much harder to isolate the queries in the MongoDB one. The visibility of the SQL queries makes maintenance easier, and performance tuning easier.<p>And I don&#x27;t buy the dynamic query argument. Those are often the most fragile ones used, and should generally be avoided, if possible. It&#x27;s better to have two or more similar queries than it is one that&#x27;s built dynamically. Even then, it&#x27;s often possible to write a single query with more complex filtering that can handle numerous very different cases.<p>At best, the MongoDB example is roughly equivalent to the SQL one. In practice, you&#x27;re trading off a huge number of benefits of relational databases (SQL usually being one of them) for little to no gain when opting for MongoDB instead.",1404564800

Spreading, is all about reaching and establishing an infected base.<p>As far as if ebola can get TO the western world, that is a 100% chance that it can.  Primarily, because there is always an underground movement of goods and people, often women and children into and out of countries, regardless of official lockdowns.  Think of it like drugs in prisons.  There should be no place more free of drugs and alcohol, and yet it&#x27;s easier to get drugs in prison than in my town.  The conversation then is about the remaining requirements to &#x27;spread&#x27;.<p>When we take a look at spreading of other lifeforms, say for instance seeds in Darwin&#x27;s Origin of Species, dispersal is only a tiny part of the equation with spread being about not just buoyancy, but rather length of sustainability once the seed arrives at a barren landmass.<p>This is again consistent with man and Mars.  We&#x27;ve gone there with robots, and will one day go there with people, but until we establish a foothold, we have not yet spread to Mars.<p>Regardless of whether the article addresses the point and only the question, all examples of life (and disputed forms of life in the form of virus), do not spread unless they take root.",1404564726

It may not be cool anymore, but like the old cool kids (Rails, Java, Perl), it has achieved critical mass, and still has some killer features.<p>Node makes SOA (service oriented architecture) a lot easier.  SOA is what all the cool kids are moving to, and is one of the reasons why it&#x27;s so easy for big companies with lots of legacy code to switch to Go.   Once your code is appropriately partitioned into services, it&#x27;s easy to write a single service in Go, and go is a nice language for writing services.<p>That being said, Node is particularly well suited for <i>consuming</i> services.  You&#x27;ll necessarily have lots of client code written to consume and use these services from your webapp.   So whenever you write a batch job or notification system or anything else that is primarily server side consumption of services or glue between services, node.js is a natural fit.<p>The other natural advantage of Node is that your business logic can run on both the server and the client.   Your standard client-side web app (angular, backbone, ember etc.) has the bulk of the business logic in the client-side models.   On the server side, the corresponding models are mostly just shims to the database, but they will also contain some business logic.   If your code is written in Node.js, you just instantiate the client side model to be access the business logic.<p>The other killer feature for node.js has already been mentioned: combining both server and client side rendering with <a href=""https://github.com/rendrjs/rendr"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rendrjs/rendr</a> or <a href=""https://github.com/wvl/highbrow"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/wvl/highbrow</a>.",1404563180

As people settled down with trying to reconnect to the superpeers, eventually the network would rebuilt itself (possibly with completely different superpeers). Once you knock out all superpeers at once, the network becomes quite a bit less distributed.<p>That said, once all superpeers are down, it could be easy to continue manually DDOS superpeers as their appeared on the network for a targeted attack.

People used ciphers to conceal messages they had to send via telegraph (having to watch someone read and tap out a private message of yours mustn't be pleasant) and to encrypt messages put in personals sections of newspapers. Things like Poe's contest in Philadelphia and the Beale Papers apparently caused a public stir.<p>The reason I suggest a homophonic cipher (or similar) rather than something like the much more secure Vignere in use for telegraph messages (only recently broken for the time) is because the Vignere system is more complicated, and requires more working out than I would expect someone writing a private message to tolerate.<p>Homophonic systems, on the other hand, are fairly easy to invent and remember on a personal basis, and can offer some security against amateur analysis. Though the technique for solving them was known, they could still prove robust - the partially homophonic cipher of Lous XIV was still unbroken at this point, despite being over a century old.<p>I'm very much an amateur (though I have read that book) but it doesn't seem that ridiculous to suggest a homophonic cipher.

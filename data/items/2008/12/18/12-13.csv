402071,comment,402061,402061,0,0,Tichy,,,"I took the Java Programmer Certification back in the day, and I remember thinking that it was not even that bad. I think if every programmer in that particular company I had been working for had taken the certification, it might have brought some improvements. At least you got to know some ins and outs of Java. It was very cheap, too, or so I remember (maybe 100€, could that be right)? I studied from a book, don't think taking expensive seminars for it would be necessary.<p>That said, I certainly wouldn't expect any advantages from putting the certification on my resume, and I wouldn't use it to judge the quality of programmers (as SwellJoe says in his comment). But for an existing team that does not consist of Rockstars, why not?",1229604425

402068,comment,402061,402061,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"IMHO, I would consider none of them to be relevant.  While, in some cases, they provide minimal assurance that someone knows a very specific set of skills to a degree that allows them to pass a test, it is <i>not</i> indicative of the kind of person I would want to hire (I wouldn't say it is contra-indicative, though seeing the Microsoft certifications on a resume might make me throw up in my mouth a little).  I want to work with people who <i>love</i> what they do.  Certifications indicate mere competence.  I'm looking for more than competence.<p>And, I've been involved in hiring decisions in the past (mostly my replacements), and I don't believe certifications have ever played a big role on the resume of anyone who impressed me.  But, I would rarely hire an employee (rather than a contractor performing one task) for a specific skill, and that's all a certification shows you.",1229603611

Plus they didn't separate cause and effect.<p>""He demonstrated tht [sic] the number of years since a society made the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture is highly correlated to the level of income in the country today. That is, the earlier the agriculture development, the higher the income.""<p>Or exactly the other way around - the better the person is at producing, the earlier they managed to switch to agriculture. Or in less politically correct terms, the smarter the people, the more they make today, and the earlier they managed to figure out agriculture.<p>""Second, the influence of population origins suggests that there is something that human families and communities transmit from generation to generation — perhaps a form of economic culture, a set of attitudes or beliefs, or informally transmitted capabilities — that is of at least similar importance to economic success as are more widely recognized factors like quantities of physical capital and even human capital in the narrower sense of formal schooling. If we understand which culturally transmitted factors are important and what contributes to their emergence and propagation, we might be able to design policy interventions that could help less successful groups and countries to close their developmental gaps.""<p>Uh hu.

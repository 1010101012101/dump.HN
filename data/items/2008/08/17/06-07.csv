History may repeat itself in some of the new energy implementations, as many in favor of clean energy in the abstract put up Not In My Back Yard opposition to local clean energy projects.",1218955563
278232,comment,278121,278121,0,0,Dobbs,,,"Part of the problem is that AT&T is a partially public company in that it receives huge benefits from the government. Also google is an entirely opt-in option where as AT&T is usually the user's only choice.<p>I know these are in some ways unfair comparisons but sadly in the world we live in the telecommunication industry is dominated by several players due to past laws. As such they need/have to play by different rules.",1218955407

(also, I don't know if he'd agree with points 4 and 7)<p>BTW, I think the reason his writing annoys me is because startups ARE difficult. The people attempting them have enough challenges to deal with -- they don't need this guy shitting on their heads (and making it seem ""cool"").",1218954950

278225,comment,278120,278139,0,0,aggieben,,,"Actually, this is the solution for Pandora:<p>Go the route of a two-tier system, where users who listen to ad-supported music get to listen to music whose label doesn't demand more than $X, and to listen to music whose label demands too much you have to pay $Y per month, where Y must be calculated to cover the costs of the royalties.  Pandora needs to realize that it's the future, and be confident about that.  Relegate the music owned by extorting labels to the digital ghetto and be done with it.  Eventually the great artists that are under a label will go independent, so you won't necessarily be killing off the best artists, in the long run.  The important thing is that Pandora and it's investors have some balls.<p>This would work great for me, because the majority of the time, I don't really care all that much who I'm listening to, really; I'm after particular styles and sounds.  Our current ""system"" of fan-dom is really just a way to keep track of what you like.  If the Genome project is capable of keeping track of what I like for me,then I don't have to worry about who it is.  This won't kill ""fandom"" either, because there will still be a handful of artists that I'll really like, and best of all, I'll discover them through the Genome's recommendations instead of ridiculous label promotions.",1218954573

Walking around with a small device attached to your iPhone to scan things and swipe a credit card on the spot to sell a product, et cetera.<p>Sorry, just a bit of deja vu. The Apple retail friends I know all hate these windows mobile devices though..but I doubt iPhone OS would be any better (ughhh I'm hating on 2.x right now, so many problems from both a user and a developer perspective).",1218953154

I'm also afraid of the other US-based indie web radios going under, sort of bizarre as they're NOT even playing any major label content, yet the same deals through SoundExchange / Copyright board apply :-o<p>Though keep in mind, US != world, and webcasters elsewhere can have fairer licensing deals so perhaps this will give a chance for innovation to flourish elsewhere (damn well hope so!)",1218952826

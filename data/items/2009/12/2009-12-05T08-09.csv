I wonder what the difference is that people perceive that makes them so cautious in one context but not the other.",1260003206

It's hard to find good stuff on craigslist, but it's equally hard for everyone, so the common folk have a decent shot at it, which keeps them coming back.<p>I love that craigslist operates this way because it's so antithetical to everything silicon valley stands for, and yet they are phenomenally successful.",1260003134

977917,comment,977420,977571,0,0,arnorhs,,,"That's a cool idea.<p>The problem with it, though. Is that you'll have to change all your accounts and profiles to this e-mail, then the password reminders etc, come to this address. This address would then become, probably, the most important e-mail you have (so security vaulnerabilities are a extra-big no-no)<p>Then there's also the added overhead of having to deal with an extra service, simply for notifications that  you usually just throw in the trash.<p>But maybe if it wasn't it's own e-mail address, but that you'd rather have your app connect to the user's e-mail inbox and download, and even delete, the notification e-mails.<p>Then it could be pretty cool (in my opinion)<p>Good luck with it :)",1260002844

977906,comment,977658,977658,0,0,thechangelog,,,"This scares me.  I can relate to the OP in that I denied my interest technology until my twenties until finally embracing it.  Evidently, we're both looking to up our game and become better programmers.  However, a few of his points are really... concerning.<p>""Great code is easy to read""<p>Not at all.  JWZ's code challenges me; heck, some of the Rails code baffles me until I sit down and think carefully.  A lot of code can be unintuitive to the uninitiated and still be great.<p>""Use github.""<p>Seems awfully narrowly scoped.  Using SCM is undeniably beneficial, but using it to become a ""master programmer"" seems a bit misguided, like becoming a master hammer swinger will make me a master finishing carpenter.<p>""Code is surprisingly more like English than like math.""<p>Ruby?  Very little code I've read would be understandable if read out loud.<p>""Learn Linux.""<p>Well, maybe.  OP must be a web dev who grew up on Windows (like me).  I don't understand how memorizing a series of command line switches will help anyone master programming.  While understanding pipes, regexes, ACL, etc... is undeniably useful, there must be better approaches than ""learning Linux.""<p>All that said, I must give kudos to the OP.  I'd like to master programming, too.  I have no formal CS education, I get lost when spelunking through big code bases, I need to ""learn Linux.""  But it seems to me that a better approach is needed.<p>The most intriguing part of the post was this comment: 
""You will read and learn more from a good $30 paperback book than dozens of free blogs.""<p>I'm really curious about this.  Does this hold true for anyone else?  Are books about design patterns really more beneficial than reading the jQuery (<i>par example</i>) source?  Dozens of times more useful?",1260002255

I also suck horribly at math which is a major cause of embarrassment from middle school to college. Lately i am trying to make up for lost time by starting to learn again. Programming as well as mathematics. I can't afford to buy too many books. So i am relying on torrents/wikibooks/carlh on reddit for now. Progress has been excruciatingly slow and painful.

977902,comment,977658,977658,0,0,derefr,,,"As to #6—software engineering, at a sort of medium level, is mostly object-oriented. At a high level, when talking about how to parallelize and scale, it's more relational, and at a low level, when designing algorithms, it's first very functional and mathematical, then when optimizing them, very imperative. OOP is only really done to figure out <i>what</i> you're building; once you know that, figuring out <i>how</i> you'll build it isn't necessarily OOP at all.",1260001772
977901,comment,977742,977742,0,0,jsz0,,,"It doesn't make sense for Apple to buy Lala just to offer their own streaming service via iTunes. Apple could have done that in house. I think they wanted the social networking pieces. Not only for discovery of new music but as a legitimate social networking site for like minded individuals. A Twitter for music sharing, discussion, official band pages, tour information, merchandise advertising, etc. The difference is Apple has a business model. Free streaming via the web, paid subscription service to sync the music offline to your iPod/iPhone, and classic iTunes purchasing for music & video. Might as well expand it to the iTunes App Store too. Peer recommendation of apps, more options for promoting your apps via social networking, maybe one-click purchases/installs via the web. Multi-player iPhone gaming with your iTunes Friend List (ala Xbox Live) Tons of possibilities for Apple. All this fits nicely into iTunes LP, Genius, maybe even MobileMe.",1260001751

977893,comment,977420,977420,0,0,derefr,,,"I've never understood what was wrong with using SMTP+IMAP/POP/Exchange as an abstract protocol for developing applications that <i>aren't email-related</i>, similar to how things that aren't web browsers today communicate via HTTP requests with things that aren't [generally thought of as] web servers.<p>Instead of reinventing the wheel with things like PUbSubHubbub, iPhone notifications, Twitter, Google Wave and so on, why not just make each API message-send an email, send it to the addresses of its subscribers, and have those subscribers check their inboxes and deal with each received message programmatically? You could give each communicating client/server program a separate email address, or you could give them a uniquely-identifying key as a MIME header and stick as many clients or servers as you wish into a single global inbox (that is, a message queue) that applications would pull messages out of—including, to polish off the abstraction, messages representing emails!<p>If the identifying key was unique to the thread/conversation/channel/wave instead of unique to the application, it would instantly nullify spam: to email someone, you'd push an ""I want to start a conversation with you"" notification to their publicly-known key under their address/identity, which they would then acknowledge (or not) by replying with a conversation key (sort of like a Facebook friend request, but temporary.) Of course, each person could have whitelists where any requests to start conversations were automatically accepted from given addresses.<p>Underneath, if you actually poked your head in with a ""real"" email client, there would be thousands of very trivial messages flying back and forth. However, we already have the infrastructure set up for exactly that; why not use it? Also, there would be many messages that would be sent (likely as spam) and silently discarded because the receiver didn't have anything corresponding to the conversation key; this would probably kill email spam down to Twitter levels, for those within the bubble of the email-in-message-in-email abstraction.<p>To optimize this, you'd likely have a global mail queue on each computer acting a bit like an SMTP server (but more likely speaking Exchange so as to keep your mobiles and other computers all reading the same messages at the same time), and an messaging library (or perhaps even a full-blown IPC kernel subsystem) that hides the fact that everything is really doing SMTP.",1260000252

I was programming a long time in C, C++ and C#, and I don't feel that programming in C# is easier in some fundamental way, or that C# programmers are easily replaceable. Yes, the mode of thinking is different in each language, but the issue that you have to think carefully is basically the same. ;-)",1226482011
361638,comment,361579,361634,0,0,litewulf,,,"Well, often times, browser choice is out of your control.<p>Anyway, my view is that this kind of attacks the problem from the wrong end. (Ideally people would have up to date software because it just happened for them.) I think telling people their software is deficient just hurts the cause because it makes them angry at the web and not the browser.<p>(PS: I've worked at places standardized on Ubuntu Dapper. Its so old that getting Firefox 2 was a hack, and forget about Firefox 3... so the other end is similar, though perhaps not as deleterious to webmasters.)",1226481900

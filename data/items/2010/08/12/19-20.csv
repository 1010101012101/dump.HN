First, the current ""devaluation""--by which I assume you mean recession, because it's not obvious what else it could be--was caused by a number of things. Second, there is no ""clear consensus"". Third, in general, banks were brought down by on-balance-sheet liabilities. In particular, I recall reading dozens of news items on write-off after write-off of subprime debt, <i>which must be on the balance sheet to count as a loss</i>, else the financial statements don't add up. Fourth, you seem to be confusing the technical accounting meaning of liability with the general meaning, but let's not get into that.<p>One more thing--the role of capitalism is not to provide capital owners with free money; people who expect returns must put in the time and effort ensuring the capital is going to good use, market economics dictates that this will in general be hard, and it is utterly bizarre that you compare <i>not getting free money</i> to <i>rape</i>. I find it befuddling and sickening that you would dare to say such a thing. Put aside your e-rage and think about it for a second.",1281643058

I was using the word ""wrong"" in its normal dictionary definition (<a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wrong"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wrong</a>).

It matters very much. Public opinion changes both the rules and <i>interpretation</i> of the rules all the time, through voting, legislative action and general intellectual osmosis.

I totally agree with you that intelligent investing takes time and skill. I dedicate maybe a half hour of my workday to investing, and I would guess that your average investor doesn't spend even that much time. Yes, it is terribly inadequate. So what are you doing to do about that? We do not live in an ideal world - we do not have medical insurance only for those who exercise constantly, avoid stress, and never eat anything with sugar in it; or driver's licenses only for those with perfect vision; etc. The rules must work for the real world, not some hypothetical ideal.<p>3. <i>The rest of your paragraph is a hyperbolic effort to put words in another's mouth.</i><p>Actually, I explicitly refrained from putting words into op's mouth: ""I am not saying you personally would subscribe to that argument of course"".

We now got a beta with nice multivariate testing, a/b testing, user segmentation, behavioral targeting options etc. So in general we got all the features I needed and it eventually turned into a business since... well Omniture at that time I could not afford and is to complex, so I thought others had the same problem.<p>Now we improved many parts of of our site and many clients. We realize thanks to some articles that we need a funnel to actually start putting all these tests in perspective. A winning test looks like WOW we got 40% more conversion on this landing-page, but what is the impact on the whole site?<p>So to prove that Reedge is making you money and show how much... I guess we need a funnel inside Reedge.com. Its a simple addition but it changes a lot of the focus. But I feel now everything starts making sense. The funnel is what its all about using Reedge.com. The tests are just tools to get increase in conversion (in the funnel).<p>But it implies I entering the area of KISSmetrics and Mixpannel<p>Second question is then: is the market large enough for more funnel en optimizing companies?<p>Love to hear your thoughts on this?<p>Dennis",1281642336

This may affect the way people <i>use</i> language, but it does not affect <i>language</i>. Language is a tool that people use to convey their thoughts. The tool not affected by the thoughts it is used to convey.<p>Second: sure, English may have lots of one-syllable words for things that are two syllables in Spanish (though the ""lol"" example you gave above is spurious because in my experience people just write ""jaja.""). But English requires more use of pronouns, articles and prepositions than Spanish does:<p>* ""No sé"" vs. ""I don't know""<p>* ""No lo vi"" vs. ""I didn't see it""<p>* ""vamos"" vs. ""let's go""<p>* ""saco la mano"" ""I take out my hand""<p>What's more ""efficient?"" It's subjective, and at the end of the day an utterly meaningless thing to analyze because trying to extrapolate cultural behaviors from the way a language uses propositions and articles is about as good science as phrenology or astrology.<p>Third: let's assume when people say ""efficient"" they mean ""simpler grammar."" People often claim that ""Latin is more complex than English"" because it has nominal declensions. But because of its declensions, word order in Latin is almost irrelevant. In place of declensions, English uses strict word order to distinguish subjects from objects. Which one is simpler? It's subjective, because your answer will depend on whether you're a native speaker of a language more like Latin or more like English.<p>But if you're writing a program to parse natural language syntax, Latin's ""complex"" nouns make it  <i>a lot</i> easier to parse programmatically than English. What does this say about Roman culture? Nothing. Again, it's the wrong way to look at language - there's no valid reason to draw a connection between grammar and cultural behavior.",1281641504

As you learn more and more you can find your own personal style. Also, you'll find good advice that is specific to the photography you're interested in: Still life? Macros? Portraits? Sports? Landscapes? Studio?<p>The most beneficial approach I've found are photography sites like usefilm.com and flickr. Browse through and find those inspirational images and photographers that you really enjoy. Then, set aside a little time to evaluate WHY you like what you are seeing? Is it the arrangement of light and dark? Geometry? Color? What are the things that make it great? What conditions lead to the great shot? Is what you are seeing repeatable by you?<p>If you have the time, you can learn about graphic design - just formal 2D design with basic shapes and layouts... these skills are general and apply to photography, painting, typography... big return for a small investment.<p>It's hard to answer your open-ended question to my satisfaction, but if you are able to reply with more detail I can try to help some more.<p>and remember<p>the best camera is the one you have with you.

HTML is layered on top of XML so I think that warrants calling it a DSL. It also is domain specific in a secondary sense in that it is targeted specifically at communicating layout to a terminal. (layout being the domain). Today that's handled partly by css by I think the principle remains. Javascript has become popular because of being embedded in HTML, now we see it ported to the server side.<p>> It doesn't suck for building UIs to such an extent that it didn't take over the world.<p>That's a lot of negations. It is used for building UIs in the same way that we use C to build operating systems, so far we've yet to find something that does a much better job. But javascript feels like a hack to make the browser do things that HTML currently can not, and to see it on the server feels a bit weird (even though it has obvious advantages, one less language to worry about).<p>With every new iteration of the HTML standard lots of stuff that previously was only possible using javascript hacks becomes part of the HTML spec. I can imagine for instance a 'validchars' property of an input field that would immediately validate characters typed in and would refuse characters illegal for that field. But I think that right now the only way to do that is to use a bit of javascript, and that may be disabled.<p>What it has to do with node is that node is yet another way of extending the capabilities of the brower, but this time in concert with server side code in a non-standard way that would be better handled by finding a generalized method.<p>I spent a lot of time building a javascript powered chat environment that would show users as avatars on other peoples website (so you could go 'group surfing' as well as to give guided tours and to interact with other public visiting a website) only to find it broken beyond repair in the next browser iteration.<p>Most HTML is here to stay and things that are deprecated are usually easily fixable.<p>I'm not saying 'node' will break beyond repair next week (it's server side after all) but I've learned my lesson (that was 4 months work down the toilet) well enough to be a bit more weary now, JS is an environment that is still very much in development.<p>It's fun to play with, that's for sure.",1281641229

We saw that when they owned up to the data they accidentally collected driving down the street.

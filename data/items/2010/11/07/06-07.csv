At that point, the speaker is just another person hanging out (unless the person is REALLY FAMOUS, and getting mobbed all the time).

When the Sun 4/110 came out, it was about 1/5 the price of a comparable Lisp Machine, and faster.

1878821,comment,1878079,1878079,0,0,zazi,,,"""Why would you want to do away with money?  As it turns out money is too powerful an incentive.  When you throw money into the equation, it tends to drown out other motivations such altruism, social norms and reputation.  Dan Ariely has a wonderful example of this in his book “Predictably Irrational” where he describes how a nursery school tried to use cash penalties to prevent parents from dropping off their kids late.  With the cash penalty the number of late drop offs went up (!) because now parents felt like they were paying for a service.  The money completely overwhelmed feeling bad for imposing upon the teachers.  Amazingly, money was so powerful that even when the school dropped the cash penalties the late drop offs stayed above their initial level.""<p>Is it just me or does anyone find something wrong with analysis of the underlying motivations for this para?<p>My read is: The introduction of money changed the dynamics of dropping their kids off late from a moral obligation to a business transaction. It being a business transaction, the penalty now becomes the loss of some money as compared to a hit to your moral standing. For busy parents, they may prefer the monetary loss as compared to feeling like a bad parent. Hence the number of people dropping their kids off late increased. If this could be true, then money may NOT be the that powerful an incentive. In this case, moral reputation/standing is a more powerful incentive. The school should be appealing to that rather than using money as a penalty.",1289110072

Web Dev curricula is awful almost everywhere, and borderline regular in the few places where it's not bad. Study business, engineering, design, computer science, etc. Universities just can't keep up with the advances in this sector right now, and the knowledge of managing a business, learning the aspects of graphic design and usability, or learning how to program in C (or Java, or Python, or whatever) will all have a bigger impact in your abilities than the curricula in a Web Dev degree. I'd also argue that for networking those degrees are better suited to put you in contact with the people you want to come in contact with.<p>I was hiring for the company I work for a few months ago, and to be honest, the only reason I interviewed 3 people with a ""Web Dev"" degree (2 where actually university certifications though) was because I had to fill a quota of people interviewed. Those 3 people totally failed the simple tests I had for them. Badly. I honestly believe this degree is actually frowned upon in the industry (don't take my word for it though, it might be a regional thing)<p>2) Consider that since you don't have any ideas yet, why not go on board at someone else's startup and get some experience. Hell you could even do so while you go to college.<p>3) The best way to come up with a great idea, is to scratch your own itch. What part of your life do you think is lacking that could be solved or improved on with a web app? Trust me, it seems hard at first, but with time you'll realize that there is lots to improve on.",1289110019

1878815,comment,1875691,1876607,0,0,dorkitude,,,"Let me clarify - I'm a startup hacker, not a bigco guy at all :)<p>And I still use MySQL all the time, right alongside so-called NoSQL solutions where they are better fit to a given purpose: Membase for high-availability collections on the order of billions-of-records in a social game; MySQL for defining the game world itself; mongoDB for any and all data for which eventual-consistency doesn't matter (e.g. analytics).  I've streamlined my MySQL dealings in precisely the ways you outlined. I have change scripts for every schema change, and I have YML-driven schema auto-generation in Symfony and declarative.  Schema changes are pushed out through staging to production - lazily when possible, and actively when possible.<p>But despite all the process improvements in the world, the dev time savings that go along with a smart, document-oriented model layer are not a myth.  I assure you, they are very real.  No longer does every new feature have to start with schema design (no matter how streamlined your schema alteration process may be, it has a nonzero cost, and one which definitely increases with scale). You can instead just get right to the code, and start setting and getting the properties your new feature will need.<p>The fact remains: SQL is not a one-size-fits-all solution any more than the recent ""massively scalable"" data stores are.  A modern backend engineer should know a lot about a variety of datastore solutions, and should think long and hard about which data should be stored in which manner(s).",1289109884

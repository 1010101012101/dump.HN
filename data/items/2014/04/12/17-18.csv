When this object is set up, they add the property &quot;answer = 42&quot; to it. Then, before making this object globally accessible at `window.ga`, they double check that `window.ga` does not yet exist or that `window.ga.answer` does not equal 42. If it already equals 42, then the initialization must have already happened (maybe the Analytics code was included twice?), and so it doesn&#x27;t proceed to clobber that already-initialized global Analytics state. Checking that the `window.ga` variable doesn&#x27;t exist is not quite enough, since other JavaScript on the page may have set that property for some reason (of course, this logic wouldn&#x27;t work if other code on the page had simple set `window.ga.answer = 42`, but that&#x27;s unlikely to happen by accident). As long as it looks like the initialization hasn&#x27;t already run, then it goes ahead and does the initialization and makes the result globally accessible at that point.<p>tl;dr: It&#x27;s not just a joke; it&#x27;s actually used to make it less likely that other JavaScript on the page hasn&#x27;t created a global variable called `ga` which may otherwise prevent the Analytics code from running.",1397324800

From Boole&#x27;s algebra, to groups, sigma-algebra, yadda yadda), linear algebra(vector spaces, etc)..<p>- Probabilities and Statistics.<p>- Analysis: (Taylor series (Lagrange, Laplace, Young, Cauchy, Maclaurin), integrals, differentiations, different series, convergence/divergence kung fu), Riemann overall, proofs, etc.. Functions, multivariable, real and complex, etc.<p>Second year:<p>- Analysis I - Numerical Analysis (Equation systems, Gauss-Seidel, different algorithms(also calculating their speeds), Newton-Raphson, extrapolation, interpolation, etc).<p>- Analysis II - Integrals(up to 3rd - curves, areas/surfaces(Green) and volumes (Ostrogradsky)), Differential equations (Wronskian, etc).<p>This is the minimum (to be able to function in other modules, and some other modules are needed before you can function in these, so there&#x27;s sort of bootstrapping of sort).<p>And then it depends what you take as specialty (if it&#x27;s something involving Signal Processing, for instance, or Control Systems, you also need to do stuff).<p>Hope that helps and you can find some things.<p>PS: None of these are done with computers, so computing stuff with Newton algorithm and operations on big matrices are all done by hand. It takes a lot of time.<p>PPS: We don&#x27;t have multiple answer questions. There&#x27;s a question, and you answer it (and some answers take multiple pages).<p>Also, most tests are designed in a way that even if you have the answer sheet right next to you, it still takes you more time to copy the answers than the time of the exam itself. i.e: Even if you don&#x27;t think and only &quot;write&quot;, the time-frame is too tight.",1397324277

Then suppose we were to drop the chamber temperature to 40°F. By all accounts, this is a huge change in temperature for a human-habitable region to undergo (an 80°F change), so the tower should produce a LOT of water.

Can I fire you for negligence if someone finds your .history since everyone should obviously know everything about bash history?<p>* If you run &quot;man history&quot;, the very first thing you see is the -c option.

There is no way of guaranteeing that temporally-defined backup policies snapshot ~ before X commands are run.<p>Bash history is a &quot;log file&quot; in the same sense as the stack used for Word&#x27;s &quot;undo&quot; mechanism is a &quot;log file&quot;.",1397323315

With the advent of cameras it appears that the % chance of being caught has gone way up, so I feel like we need to reduce the punishments to balance the equation.<p>Having longer punishments is not positive for society, it is expensive, doesn&#x27;t help the person doing the time and doesn&#x27;t help the victims. Reducing punishments as we can catch a higher number of crimes makes sense.<p>I hope that the discussion about crime and punishment shifts to reduce sentences to help balance that equation.

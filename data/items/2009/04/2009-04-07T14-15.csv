On my large-scale project, it's much faster for me to restart the program with new breakpoints than compile and run again.<p>The latest gdb has checkpoints. That is a significant advantage over printf-based methods.<p>Of course, <i>reasoning</i> about programs is a very very effective tactic to solve bugs.

They seem like good catalysts for cities that want to get new businesses operating in them.<p>The challenge, in my opinion, is that although they can be great for the communities, I think they come at a cost for entrepreneurs.<p>I've done a lot of things from a distance. After art school I moved away from the city to paint. I reasoned that doing so cut costs and that I could paint well anywhere. Years later I partnered in an interaction design firm in a small town employing a similar rationale. Most recently, we've been working on our startup from Vancouver, which is beautiful and a nice place to raise a family.<p>In each of these instances, the logic for being away from a center (be it art, design or startup) has been sound. Additionally, there are always strong proponents in these communities to keep people doing ""great things close to home."" No matter how strong the logic is though, it simply doesn't hold up. There are greater opportunities for those who put themselves at the heart of the ""action"".<p>You could likely start a great company in Pennsylvania, but even with low rent and more equity, you'd still have a weaker ""deal"". The appeal of YC, in my opinion, is that it's so close to where people think in startup-terms and is run by people who actually live in that world.<p>Although some will bemoan my saying so, the closer you can get to the action, the better. There are probably some great actors in Helsinki, but I bet you'll never hear anything about them.",1239115921

I knew how to write python syntax, but had no idea how to write code that doesn't suck. I still write bad code, but at least i know when its bad and i need to change it. Scheme thought me how to spot ugly code. I still use for and while loops(recursion is expensive in python, and you shouldn't write scheme in python) but i learned to write small and simple functions and combine them in smart ways(list comprehensions, maps, filters, decorators...). I guess i knew that from reading about the unix philosophy, but it took me to see it in code to understand it.

</code></pre>
Hard to call Clojure ""old"" when it's only been around a couple years.<p><pre><code>    The exciting languages to learn now are Python, Ruby, Groovy, etc.
</code></pre>
Clojure has been very successful at building nerd ""street cred.""  It has latched onto the fascination with functional programming for parallel applications, for one.  It also makes use of concise syntax for data structure literals, like Python and Ruby, too.  Dynamic, etc. etc.<p><pre><code>    Lisp is only for artificial intelligence.
</code></pre>
Don't think Clojure has this problem.<p><pre><code>    Lisp is interpreted and slow.
    Lisp programs page heavily, so they're even slower.
</code></pre>
Clojure gets the performance benefits of running on the highly tuned JVM, with tricks like type hints to get close to Java speeds for critical portions of code.  Worst case, you can always drop into Java as your ""assembly"" language.<p><pre><code>    The parentheses look weird and hard to manage.
</code></pre>
Clojure mixes up () with [] {} to make code easier to mentally parse.<p><pre><code>    Lisp uses prefix notation for things that every other popular language
    does with infix notation, which is just very weird. (And it leads to
    more parentheses.)
</code></pre>
No change here.<p><pre><code>    Lisp is too big.
    Lisp is too hard to learn.
</code></pre>
Clojure is pretty small and doesn't take much time to get started.<p><pre><code>    Lisp is all about lists and recursion; that's all you do with it.
</code></pre>
Some might start to think ""Clojure is all about functional programming.""  Don't know if that's good or bad.<p><pre><code>    I don't know which implementation to use.
</code></pre>
There's only one Clojure implementation.<p><pre><code>    It isn't ""batteries included"" (that is, it's not easy to get set up with all the tools and libraries you need).
</code></pre>
You get all the libraries written for Java.<p><pre><code>    I don't like Emacs, and you can't use Lisp without Emacs.

I use Emacs, which is also great for Clojure, so I can't judge how easy it is to program in Clojure without Emacs.<p><pre><code>    Lisp isn't useful for my career; few potential employers want it.

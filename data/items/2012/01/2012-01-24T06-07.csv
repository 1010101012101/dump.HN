3503774,comment,3500196,3503659,2,0,molmalo,,,"Think about this:<p>Flash is not Adobe's core business. It's just a result. Their business is to make and sell amazing Editors. CS is their main product. They bought Macromedia, just to own much of the market of Designer-oriented applications. And Macromedia filled a Gap.<p>But from now on, they are investing heavily in building tools for HTML5.<p>-You can see them building Flash-to-HTML5 conversion tools. [1] (this link is almost a year old, so I'd expect them to have something much more advanced by now).<p>- They are building HTML5 Editors [2]<p>- They stopped developing Flash Player mobile. [3] In the same post where they state that they will stop developing Flash Player for mobile browsers, they state: <i>Adobe to More Aggressively Contribute to HTML5</i>.<p>Ok, ok, they also state that they will keep working in Flash for desktop. But it's like when any software company says: ""We'll drop X, Y, Z  so we can focus on A"".  That's something said to please their shareholders, so it doesn't sounds like ""As our products are no longer needed, we'll just kill them"".<p><i>Part of the beauty of a closed environment is not having to worry about trying to convince other browsers what features to standardize</i><p>Sure, but if you are a guest inside the browser, and the browser developer just throws you away, you have to move somewhere else. That happened with Apple, and it's happening  again this year Microsoft. Windows 8 won't support flash running on Metro. Even more, they won't support ANY plugin.<p>Apple just wants to keep selling their Creative Suite. So, the best thing for them to do, is to focus on HTML5, because they now know that Flash is doomed sooner or later. And they are doing it. I expect to see in the near future something like Adobe Flash Professional but designed for HTML5.<p>I don't want to be rude, but I keep seeing people refusing to see this. People who won't accept the fact that Apple has realized they need to move on, and they are on their way to do so.<p>Sooner or later, flash will be to Adobe as VB6 is to Microsoft. Legacy code.<p>Just my thoughts.<p>[1] <a href=""http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/wallaby/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/wallaby/</a>

Imagine for a moment that you are Adobe. You have an amazing  suite of products, and one few of them are based on Flash.
You realize that the browser developers have chosen to work and invest in something else. You go through all 5 stages of grief [4]. You deny it, you get angry, you bargain, you get depressed, but finally at least, you accept it. You HAVE to adapt and you have to work with them. But you won't have anything to sell for at least 1 or 2 years. And you still have this wonderful suite on the market.<p>What do you do? Do you go out and yell:  DON'T BUY IT! WAIT UNTIL WE RELEASE OUR FUTURE-PROOF PRODUCT!!!<p>Of course not!!! You say <i>We are already working on Flash Player 12 and a new round of exciting features which we expect to again advance what is possible for delivering high definition entertainment experiences</i><p>But at the same time, in the same paragraph you say:  <i>We will continue to leverage our experience with Flash to accelerate our work with the W3C and WebKit to bring similar capabilities to HTML5 as quickly as possible, just as we have done with CSS Shaders.  And, we will design new features in Flash for a smooth transition to HTML5 as the standards evolve so developers can confidently invest knowing their skills will continue to be leveraged</i>.<p>Read it again:  <i>a smooth transition to HTML5</i>.<p><i>TRANSITION.</i><p>That's their way to say: ""Keep buying and using our products, while we develop our HTML5 editors. Then, you buy our new products and move to HTML5.""<p>They have went through the last phase. They have accepted it. It's time for their community to do the same.<p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model</a>",1327388311

They don't want to hit your minimum (since it may be volatile) and they really, really don't want to hit below your minimum.  And they are okay with hitting their maximum.<p>In my location it costs 15-20k to find a senior engineer you want to hire.  Once that happens, you really, really don't want to lose them in salary negotiations, or to another offer.  So you don't lowball them.  If they give you a number they can lowball themselves, but if they don't, then you offer something near your maximum.<p>Your advice is that you give them a number so high that you're sure it's above their anchor and that it gives them no information about your anchor.  But that doesn't change their anchor, and not giving a number at all is pretty close to that, while being nearly risk-free to you.<p>Of course, once they've asked for a number, you've refused, and they've pushed on it, it may not be risk-free to fight anymore.

3503760,comment,3502850,3503407,2,0,jangusa,,,"1 (re: Crooked Account Books) - if the government knows you have accounting books, they can force you to turn them over.  You must provide them with physical access to the books.  In your example, you could take the hard drive out of your laptop and hand it to them.  However, if your hard drive was encrypted, and you had the encryption key memorized, you would not have to tell them.  If the judge hearing your case did not understand the intricacies of Fifth Amendment doctrine, like the judge in this case, he might order you to decrypt the hard drive.  In this case, your lawyer would ask the judge to stay (i.e., delay) his order to give you a chance for interlocutory appeal.<p>If the judge did not grant the stay, you could turn over the key but explain that you were not waiving your Fifth Amendment rights.  Then when you were found guilty, you could appeal, argue that your Fifth Amendment rights were violated, and get your conviction overturned.  Alternatively, you could not turn over the key, go to jail for contempt, and wait for your lawyer to appeal the contempt finding and get you out of jail.<p>2 (re: password vs. physical key in secret place) - in some cases, the act of producing a physical key may actually be protected under the Fifth Amendment.  If the police can show that you know the key's location, then by forcing you to produce the key they are not forcing you to give any testimony, and you have no Fifth Amendment protection.  However, if they ask you for a key but can't prove that you have it, they are asking you to create implicit testimony.  The implicit testimony is ""I know where the key is.""  If this testimony would end up incriminating you, the it is protected by the Fifth Amendment and you don't have to produce the key.",1327387576

You have no idea if people are innately able to program, learn calculus, or ""think in three dimensions"" (btw - driving is a 2d problem). I don't. You don't. No one does. We do not have a framework for discussing the fundamental (genetic) basis of human intelligence. We do not understand even its most basic components. Some people seem to have ""good memories"" or be ""fast at computation"" but that's about all we can actually, honestly, meaningfully say. Culture is so ridiculously complicated and so powerful that it's  impossible to impossible to distinguish between what is innate and what is imprinted. The fact that basically no one is able to predict the intellectual abilities of future humans is an indication of this (e.g. what would a mathematician from the 19th century say about the ""fundamental"" mathematical abilities of his fellow humans?).<p>The point of the article is that coding is in some sense a core/intrinsic skill. That anything you do is actually deeply tied to coding in the sense that ""something you do"" (technology, in the general sense) is equivalent to ""algorithm."" Weaving is coding. Playing a game is coding. Building a house is coding. Painting a picture is coding. Proving a theorem is coding (Curry-Howard Isomorphism). Sure, they're different, more intuitive, weird types of coding, but the fact that you can't see that they -are- coding implies a limitation on your ability to abstract the concept of ""coding"" sufficiently.<p>The fact is that coding is a deeply human activity, and that by understanding coding we are really understanding ourselves and the fundamental means by which we -collectively- understand reality. The fact is that we need some shared understanding of ourselves, of our logical facilities, of the basis of our ability to produce and thrive and know how to interact with the universe. Without a shared framework, communication is useless/impossible.",1327386842

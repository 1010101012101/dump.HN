I saw a talk by Ed Catmull of Pixar a couple weeks ago where he talked about how once an idea can be reduced to a slogan, you don't need the idea anymore, just the slogan. His example was architects saying they are designing buildings ""from the inside-out,"" and how it was a good idea for a few years, until he was working with an architect who designed a shitty building and used the phrase ""designed from the inside-out"" to dismiss criticism.<p>For Google, if employees get to the point where ""do no evil"" is a just a slogan that helps them get to sleep at night and they stop constantly questioning their actions, it doesn't mean anything anymore. In fact, it's worse than had it never existed at all, because it's used as a justification for things of questionable evil-ness. ""Google stores everything they can about what you do online without asking your permission, but it doesn't matter, because they would never do anything evil with all that information."" They can tell themselves that, but it doesn't mean it isn't evil.",1271631583

Mainly because we're from two different worlds. He comes from a Mainframe (z/TPF) background and usually laughs at what we think is high-performance or a heavy load on our web servers. (He also likes to ask when I'm going to learn a real programming language like assembler.)<p>Just last night I was asking him why web companies don't run companies of just one of these juggernauts mainframes. The price of the hardware seems to be the biggest hurdle. But there's also the fact that if you want 'feature x' with how you store data... well you write it yourself so that it runs as fast as possible. You won't find VISA running distributed MySQL instances anytime soon. The mainframe mindset seems to be that you build the system EXACTLY how you need it. No More, No Less! The way I think of it is like Lego blocks.<p>Today we take a companies like Twitter who think ""We have a lot of different kinds of blocks, how can we make them fit together and do what we need.""<p>Mainframe developers think ""We need to handle tens of thousands of transactions per second doing X. So lets make our own blocks that fit together perfectly and do exactly that.""<p>This means you end up having to re-invent a lot of things. But you re-invent exactly what you need and leave out the rest. I wonder if the future is in a hybrid of these two types of systems. Perhaps we need to put Mainframes in the Cloud and let people purchase time on them like Windows Azure & AWS. I would certainly like to play with that kind of horsepower. Or perhaps the future is in something that doesn't exist yet which the author seems to suggest.",1271629469

So, I was happy to read this article and found it quite good actually :) Good job to the author.<p>Here's how I can summarize it: monads are a kind of pattern which ""implements"" "">>="" and ""return"" as a Int implements ""eq"" or ""ord"". The job of >>= is to act a little bit like the Null Pointer pattern in the OO world. For instance, if everything is ok, it returns the good value else it throws an exception or return an error value. However, to use the >>= function, you need to encapsulate your first value. Depending of monads, that ""encapsulated"" value may be different. In this article, we were working with the Maybe type, however, monads can be of any type. So, the ""return"" function takes care of encapsulating the value in the right type so that the >>= function can use it.<p>Anyhow, that's what I understood ;-) And I'll continue to read learnyouhaskell.com",1271628312

Yet we still pretty much universally revile AIG.<p>Say that 1% of people are evil.  It's totally reasonable to expect an individual to be non-evil; after all, 99 out of 100 (in this model) are.<p>But then extend that out to a large corporation.  The probability that you'll find at least one evil person in a startup of 10 is (1 - .99^10) = 0.095, or about 10%.  The probability that you'll find at least 100 evil people in a corporation of 20,000 is (1 - .99^19900), which according to Google calculator is 1, i.e. virtually certain (there's some round-off error there, but you get the point).

They don't understand why we solve sqrt problems but not cube root problems but they know how to compute doubling time for bacteria growing in a petri dish.<p>Your fourth paragraph is an argument in favor of what I've been saying.  The applications we teach ought to be applications to math; not to physics or biology.<p>But back to the apathy problem.  People aren't going to be motivated by number theory or bacteria in a petri dish if they possess too great a disdain for knowledge.",1271628279

If type of food is important and you only measure total calories you have a problem in your experiment design.  It seems here there is also a subject selection problem.  A 5% body fat difference for starting out is pretty significant.  This is the trouble with the vast majority of this research.  It's done in such a way that it's hard to learn much from it.",1271628138

I agree with a previous commenter that trusting passengers to behave correctly is looking for problems.",1271628119

Ha!<p>Really, though, we get the point. It's very similar in shape and looks, and doesn't have much in the way of new functionality. Let's hear something new.",1271628090

However, the premise of the argument is that there is too much grey area. It is disingenuous to rank all iPhone sales against a gaming platform; anecdotal results would lead me to believe a majority of smartphones are not used as gaming devices.",1313197189
2879883,comment,2877424,2878673,3,0,saurik,,,"The situation with Java is even stronger than ""MS just realized"": MS was /forced/. Back then, MS thought Java was great, but looked at it as a language and execution engine as opposed to a dream about ""write once, run everywhere"", and so released J++, allowing developers of Java applications to use a replacement toolkit that bound to native Win32 widgets. This caused them to get sued, and the result of the case was that they lost their license to Java. J++ 1.1 seriously came with a dialog when you ran it apologizing that they were legally required to stop distributing the application, and that you should look into alternatives. Thus, .NET was born.",1313197154

Re 2: Certainly correct, but to ignore the possibility of English words having less entropy than it appears at first is odd given the patterns English words often follow.<p>I'm interested in reading more about those entropy estimations, can you recall where you read about it? According to Applied Cryptography Shannon states that entropy per letter <i>decreases</i> as the text grows. Shannon estimates 2.3 bits per letter for chunks of 8 letters but it drops down to between 1.3 and 1.5 bits per character for 16 character chunks.<p>Applied Cryptography cites a paper by Shanon called ""Predication and Entropy in Printed English"" in the Bell System Technical Journal from 1951.

2879874,comment,2879464,2879464,37,0,lionhearted,,,"Central planning isn't bad just because it's bad, there's reasons for its badness. Here's a few -<p>First, you get people who don't know about a profession trying to dictate to people who do know about it. EX: Hitler and Stalin managing farm production, even though they didn't know anything about farming - agricultural production goes down leading to famines.<p>Second, you lose the price signal which says what people really want enough to act on, given scarce resources. This leads to a feedback loop where goods priced below the equilibrium have demand far in excess of supply. EX: Everyone would love to buy a subsidized steak instead of a hamburger, so if steak is subsidized to hamburger prices, there'll be shortages and you'll need to impose rationing and coupons and things (which becomes a dual currency system where the coupon/ration becomes the real constraint currency, and then those become blackmarketed until an equilbrium is reached - but only with a lot of hassle).<p>Third, central planners generally have incentives that diverge widely from the people they're supposed to be planning for - ex, making sure those new centrally planned jobs go to your political supporters. This has happened in the majority of centrally planned economies.<p>You wouldn't expect a high concentration of wealth to have these same problems. Steve Jobs having central planning ability over Apple, and by extension, over a lot of the high quality glass and semiconductor industries isn't the same as Brezhnev having that power. Jobs, of course, is much more competent at building high end consumer technology than Brezhnev and not prone to make some of the common errors.",1313196951

People from a more statistical background will grill you on those things.

People who come from a more C.S. side of things will try to explore your knowledge about ""machine learning algorithms"" which typically are easy to learn if you know your math background.

A rowdy crowd in a space like that is definitely a threat to safety.<p>I think of it BART taking away one of its amenities in order to maintain its core services and responsibility to safety than a draconian abuse of force.

We're talking about key concepts in Political Economy (PE) and I'm clearing saying that I disagree that Central Planning takes place in the way the author implies. The author tells us that the widening income gap is leading to ... central planning. And I say that's totally not true, it's a false causality. A terrible income gap exists, but Central Planning = Government decides and industry follows, like in China. Our system is the opposite, with industry deciding and government getting out of the way. That's Corporatism, not Central Planning. I'm saying that Corporatism creates the income gap, so Central Planning, if it exists, has nothing to do with it.

A similar point is made by John Batelle in the Wired article, and is another reason why non-GAAP measures like EBITDA that exclude amortization are widely used.<p>This doesn't say very much about whether Demand Media is profitable once you exclude amortization, but it is an important thing to consider.",1284299951

Jeff wanted to say ""look at how Android has progressed"", but somehow go waylaid into defending his historic strong iPhone bias, destroying whatever example he might be making.<p>However, to your point, discarding ""tastefulness"" as meaningless subjectivity, yes of course you can iterate towards a better, more attractive, more usable user experience.<p>Anyone who has lived with Android through 1.x on to 2.x and finally to 2.2 would say that many elements have absolutely improved dramatically -- constant usage provides feedback that refines design, while simply having time and resources provides the avenue to implement more advanced UI elements.<p>And during that time Google has added a number of UI and design experts to the team (again, time and focus: It actually matters now, whereas before they got the core product it didn't). It does seem to be paying off.",1284299930

The assumption that if dozens of VCs are rejecting you it's because ""you aren't ambitious enough"" is probably a great blog post title but poor advice for a startups execution ...<p>In reality it's because you don't check a checkbox, and the value for you is to: a) develop resilience to rejection (always great) and b) ascertain what you didn't articulate that meant that you didn't check the appropriate checkbox. Finding out how is quite hard, but insanely valuable. (eg: we once got rejected by an investor for reasons of our market being perceived as too small, after hearing this it was obvious there was confusion in our story, we iterated on our story a few times and that concern was removed)<p>The kind of rejection that'll make you give up is when users reject your product, I'm blown away this isn't discussed ever here.",1284298927

1683637,comment,1681721,1683576,0,0,Mz,,,"If you cannot see that interacting with CBP officers is ""social interaction"", then I don't see where we can ever come to any agreement.  And if you were not there and if there is also no videotape of the interaction, I don't see how you can assert with any certainty that he was not being rude at all.  As I stated above, the vast majority of such things is conveyed not by words but by voice tone, body language, facial expression and so on.  As far as I know, the only account of the incident is from his point of view.  Perhaps the CBP officers have gotten together and written their own account, but so far I have seen no mention of it (and I consider that unlikely as it could potentially cost them their jobs -- security jobs typically require you to generally keep your mouth shut).  His writing tone and his framing of things (that these people are ""thugs"" who deserve to be treated a certain way by him for, apparently, not simply up and quitting their jobs as proof that they don't agree with ...whatever he is taking issue with) doesn't give me much confidence that he wasn't rude in some way.<p>For that matter:  Most people cannot up and quit their jobs.  Having a job is not strong evidence that someone wholeheartedly supports and believes in all policies and practices of their place of employment.  In many cases, it is only evidence that they prefer putting up with the crap at work to putting up with the alternatives (such as homelessness).  Even in cases where someone does strongly disagree with what goes on at work, most people cannot afford to simply up and quit and there may be little they can do to change it while they are there.  If they really feel strongly about it, they typically begin job hunting and leave as soon as is practicable without cutting their own throats.  Additionally, if they have any sense, afterwards they tend to keep their mouths shut about the things they did not approve of.  Talking trash about a former employer can be a good way to ensure that other people will be reluctant to hire you.<p>He makes snide remarks about the ""low pay"" of these people in a way which strikes me as classist and then makes even uglier remarks about how they deserve his treatment for not up and quitting which he claims they can do ""at any time"".  He damns them coming and going, which does nothing to convince me he was even civil.  Everything he wrote paints a picture of an individual with a chip on their shoulder who is actively looking to create such a confrontation.  In his own words:  ""But that’s a small price to pay to remind these thugs that their powers are limited and restricted.""  So his stated goal was not to simply exercise his rights.  His stated goal was to ""teach them a lesson"", in essence. That kind of goal is generally rife with unstated hostility.",1284298780

Try get an internship or voluntarily role at Google or Facebook, Twitter etc - what you will learn there and the contacts you will get will be invaluable, even if you work on the business rather than technical side.<p>3-5 years of college and grad school will be an absolute waste of time for you. You don't actually learn anything in college of use, you hopefully just learn how to learn but you can do this on your own time for cheaper. Also the contacts but there are better ways of getting a good network together. When I hire or interview someone I only look at their experience, especially any side and personal projects they have, I relay don't care what they studied or what college they went to.

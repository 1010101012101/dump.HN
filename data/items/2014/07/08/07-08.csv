If you are making SaaS or a web based app, then it is perfectly reasonable to require JavaScript.  If you are making public websites, that display content or represent a brand, then you probably want to cater to those who don&#x27;t have it enabled.  Also remember it is not just the 2% that have javascript disabled that you need to consider.  You should also take into account anyone who would require 508 compliance on your site.

The entire first course is essentially dedicated to teaching you how to not blow your leg off while managing memory.<p>We don&#x27;t even touch data structures, algorithms, composition, inheritance, etc until &quot;CS 2,&quot; which is also in C++. When I first tried Python as part of a 1-week assignment in &quot;CS 2.5&quot; (a lab course), I was blown away and hooked pretty quickly. We don&#x27;t get formal Python experience really until the extremely work-intensive upper division programming languages course. From my perspective, I think a large number of people are discouraged by CS 1 and how it&#x27;s more of a programming class than a CS class. The only benefit of a C++ introduction is that it&#x27;s easier for people to transition to C and lower level code for the operating systems class. Still, C is pretty well covered by our &quot;CS 2.5&quot; and &quot;CS 3.&quot;<p>Other fun facts: our CS 0 (programming for non-CS majors) is split into three classes and is also in C++!<p>I accidentally took a C++ at a community college during high school and was forced to skip &quot;CS 1&quot; when I enrolled for my first quarter. I felt so unprepared for &quot;CS 2&quot; that I actually audited a good number of &quot;CS 1&quot; lectures and did half of the projects for the class even though I didn&#x27;t take it.<p>Actual course numbers:<p>CS 1 -> CS 31<p>CS 2 -> CS 32<p>CS 2.5 -> CS 35L<p>CS 3 -> CS 33<p>CS 0(a-c) -> PIC 10(a-c)",1404805851

8003420,comment,8001337,8002089,7,0,hans0l074,,,"I do not know any Python (yet) - and my comment is probably off-topic. I spent a fall semester at Northeastern U, Boston in &#x27;97 and took a graduate course in Data Structures which was taught in C. I loved this course and finished top of the class (It helped that I was already familiar with C from an undergrad engg course). I fell in love with C. Implementing dequeues, linked lists, trees etc. with C was a pleasure - I learnt a lot about memory management responsibilities, smart error handling and began to understand how programming can be beautiful. Many years later when I started learning and working with Java, I felt that if this course had been taught with Java, I would not have gained as much (I could be wrong). The simple steps of typing your code in the standed editor supported by the environment (we were using a flavour of Unix in school), saving your work, compiling on the CLI and seeing the results - we just had to focus on our algorithm and nothing else. Your sentence &quot;Many of our students have never programmed with a text editor before our unit, and dropping them into the big boilerplate world of Java micro-management was not good for them or for the course&quot; stands out for me in this context. Since I know zero Python, I wonder how it compares.

8003392,comment,8001337,8002381,2,0,reuven,,,"I&#x27;m also an MIT grad (class of 1992).  I took 6.001 back in the Scheme days.  I loved it, and have found that the lessons learned in that class have stayed with me for a very long time.  I now teach professional programming classes, and it&#x27;s a rare lecture that doesn&#x27;t use some of what I talked about there.<p>The irony is that I teach a lot of Python programming classes.  And despite that, and my love of Python, I think it&#x27;s a shame that they no longer use Lisp (or Scheme, or Clojure) for the equivalent of 6.001.<p>Python is easier to understand and get into.  And Python has some amazing features that you want, such as first-class functions.  And it&#x27;s a real-world language, which you can&#x27;t say about Clojure, even with its growing popularity.  And Python is my strong recommendation for everyone&#x27;s first language, because it&#x27;s so easy to get into.<p>But there are some things that are just easier to understand in Lisp than in other languages.  Implementing Lisp in Lisp (metacircular evaluator) is a fabulous way to think about programming languages that is harder in Python than in Lisp.  (Not impossible, but harder.)  Lisp allowed us to think about programming in all sorts of new ways, because it handled so many of those paradigms so well.<p>So I still think that the intro CS class should be in a form of Lisp, because it opens your mind up to possibilities.  But if you&#x27;re not going to go that route, then Python is a terrific first language, and I&#x27;m quite happy to see it getting the attention it deserves.",1404804895

This possibility is suggested by the claustrum&#x27;s seemingly unique anatomical situation--so many other regions run into it like no other.<p>If the claustrum is a junction connecting myriad systems, enabling coordinated forms of mental life, possibly consciousness, then in a sense, it could really be a key to consciousness.<p>Calling this critical juncture key to consciousness is not saying the claustrum is a theater where a homunculus watches everything come together, or that consciousness happens in the claustrum.<p>Consciousness is a state of the brain where disparate systems interact, and the claustrum may be key to explaining that coordination in consciousness.<p>Borrowing the car analogy in the article, the ignition system isn&#x27;t where a car &quot;runs&quot;. Nonetheless, the ignition is key to explaining how everything that comes together to put the car in a running state. I think people are misreading what the investigator meant when he suggests the claustrum might be key to explaining the conscious state.<p>Am I wrong here?

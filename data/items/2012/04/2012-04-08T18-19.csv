They are a hugely successful company that has entered the public zeitgeist in a way that few of their competitors have.  So, with this comes a lot more scrutiny, and thus it was easy for Apple to be the focus of attention when Foxconn's labor practices started to be reported on in the US.<p>Apple is handling this issue well (and much better than their competitors).  But the real ""issue"" here is something that Apple has understood for a while.  ""The jobs aren't coming back"" is a product of many factors, and the cost of labor is a red herring in this debate.",1333911168

3814524,comment,3814363,3814363,44,0,nirvana,,,"The real irony, to my mind is this: Apple is the company with the most integrity I've ever known. This manifests itself everywhere- from product quality to service at Apple stores.<p>Apple has been proactive in making sure their employees are well taken care of, here and abroad, and they've been doing this for the past decade.<p>They've been auditing suppliers in various ways for far longer than this story has even been in the news, going back at least to the 1990s.<p>Sure, Apple is the biggest, most profitable tech company, and it is also the one with the biggest brand.  I think Apple's brand is a huge factor here- it is a global brand, it is associated with really good values such as quality, respect, integrity, etc, and thus it is the most attractive brand the put dirt on.<p>This explains why media, and unscrupulous people focus on attacking Apple for ""working conditions"".<p>But the reality is, when Foxconn has positions open to work for Apple, they get massive numbers of people who want to come work for them.  Everyone in china has methods of communication, if Apple wasn't the best place to work, they wouldn't have so many applicants.  Word would get out.<p>Apple solved this problem before it ever became a problem, but they are attacked because their brand is strong, and the people attacking them lack integrity.<p>They're also being attacked because it fits a political agenda.  Unions and regulation have destroyed the manufacturing employment levels in the USA (actual manufacturing capacity is higher now than then, but a lot fewer people are employed) and so rather than recognize themselves as the cause of business moving overseas, they wish to demonize the businesses that did move overseas in the hope of coercing them to move back here.  Every political season there are proposals that companies be punished for doing business overseas.  This is why.<p>Thus perpetuating the fantasy that Apple runs sweatshops or uses ""slave labor"" is politically motivated.<p>The reality:  When Foxconn cut back overtime (in response to this muckraking) the employees were very upset.  They want to work more hours.<p>The employees have spoken...<p>----<p>I digressed.  My original point is, that all these other companies are benefiting from Apple leading the way here.  Apple is teaching the chinese how to be ethical and to treat employees well, by requiring it, and all these other manufacturers are benefiting from that.<p>This is a cost to apple, and it is a profit to those other manufacturers.<p>Thus it is really ironic when the media smears apple-- the company that has literally revolutionized manufacturing in china, as far as working conditions go.",1333910984

3814520,comment,3813966,3814392,12,0,msutherl,,,"It forces you to structure your application as tiny communicating processes which you route by hand. You're actually coding quite close to the hardware. When you want a process to communicate with another  correct me if I'm wrong somebody  you can only communicate processes that are physically adjacent on the chip and you actually write something like ""the one to the left/right"". Each process is very small and one of the blogs I looked at was very much about optimizing code-size to fit in such a small place. This results in a situation where if your problem does not easily map to this kind of architecture, then you have no other option.<p>But the same thing can be said of programming at a low level with a Von Neumann architecture. Such architectures are an exceptionally bad match for what the Green Array (dataflow) architecture is good for, namely highly concurrent applications involving processing flows of data such as sensor networks, computer vision, and all manner of routers.<p>The way that Von Neumann systems handle this problem is by having high-level programming languages (like C), which gives you some level of abstraction from the hardware so that you can model your program however you like and force it to map to the architecture, even if the problem intrinsically doesn't map well. This is why parallel programming is a hard problem. It's not actually a hard problem (well, it could be intrinsically harder), it's just a hard problem for architectures that are not designed for it. On a Green Arrays chip, parallelism is the most natural thing in the world.<p>Currently Green Arrays has no equivalent of C, and as I understand, this is unlikely to change as the philosophy of Forth is to stay close to the metal and make that an enjoyable experience. That's probably a good thing actually. it's more efficient to design problems to fit the hardware than to use one architecture for absolutely everything as we've been doing for the past 40 years or whatever (with notable exceptions like the Transputer, the Connection Machine, Xmos XCore chips and FPGA's to a certain extent).",1333910931

3814497,comment,3814089,3814089,36,0,nirvana,,,"This is one of the reasons I'm kinda ambivalent about taking money.  I've been working for startups since the 1990s (and starting companies too).  I've seen the down years in 1995, 2001-2003, 2008-2009, and I've seen the manias of 1997-2000, 2004-2007, 2010-2012, and it just leaves me really concerned that taking VC money is a whole lot about timing.  I want to build a business, not get rich with a stock market (e.g.: selling stock to VCs with perfect timing.)    This plus the generally hostile and irrational terms VCs require (liquidation preferences, etc) have had me focusing on making our business profitable from day one. (or at least from day one after the product launches.)<p>On the other hand-- man, it would really be great to have $500k in the bank to hire some people so we could grow really fast.  But we're not there yet-- that would be a bad investment because we're still doing customer development, we're still trying to discover our business, so to speak.<p>I feel like, if I go down the path of trying to raise money now, I'll be spending a lot of time doing something that doesn't help us discover that business. But if I don't, who knows what things will be like in a while, if it turns out that we really <i>could</i> use that money.<p>In the end, though, I side on the idea that money can be a nice accelerant, if it is gotten on good terms (terms are more important than valuation) from good people (and how in the hell do you figure out who those people are?  I have seen a lot of damage done by investors in my career.)<p>But at the end of the day, if the company is profitable, you can plow %100 of those profits into growth.  If the company isn't profitable, the <i>only</i> way to survive is outside investment.<p>I don't want my companies future in the hands of other people, so I'm pursuing a highly profitable business that is super capital efficient and doesn't require outside funding to launch.<p>I strongly recommend others consider this approach as well.  Yeah, you might get into YC and then not need this, but if you don't, find a business model that makes you ramen profitable right away.",1333910341

If you actually had to allocate real memory-backed pages for every allocation a process made, had the right to, but never modified, the size of each process would be a lot larger. For example, if a process consumes 1GB of memory and forks a child, the child has access to the same 1GB of memory, but it doesn't really consume 1GB of memory. It has mapped a bunch of copy-on-write pages from its parent, and when either of them next modify those pages, the real memory is allocated.<p>If they never modify those CoW pages, they can both happily keep using the same copy of the page in memory, and you can have two 1GB processes using a total of e.g. 1.01GB of real memory.<p>This is very useful in practice, but it means that the system needs the ability to over-commit memory allocations (allow CoW allocations etc., when there is no actual memory available to back it), and over-commit currently, and probably should, requires swap (some place to dump pages in case an over-committed allocation comes calling).",1333908256

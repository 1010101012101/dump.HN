4584371,comment,4583587,4583587,2,0,javajosh,,,"A thoughtless sentiment. I can't imagine anyone reading (or writing) a post like this and being inspired for longer than 10 minutes. There are many such sentiments on the web and in books, of course.<p>Imagine, if you will, this sentiment applied to the art of computer programming. ""Fuck 'em"" you say one day. ""I don't need to listen to the hoary old bastards of CS - I can do things <i>my way</i>."" This lasts exactly as long as it takes you to run into the exact same issues as the ""hoary old bastards of CS"" - and what do you know, you find yourself unable to even begin coming up with novel solutions.<p>This is not to say that it isn't useful to revisit the origins of the art - it is. And it's not to say that some people do precisely this, to some extent, and come back with something useful. Rich Hickey and Clojure are one example, and Bret Victor and his (sadly proprietary) prototypes another. There are more, of course, and they tend to be the stars of the industry.<p>There are not that many successful rebels. Many more attempt to buck the trend, and simply fail to produce anything that even works, and if they do, then it's usually just not that useful to people. A failed rebel, you come back to the traditional ways, tail between your legs, and build software like anyone else, contenting yourself with flourishes and, perhaps, being an early adopter (because if you can't design something novel and useful, you might as well be an early advocate for something novel and useful.)<p>The tradeoffs, risks, and odds are basically the same for life. You can indeed say ""Fuck 'em"" but chances are you'll end up a failed rebel. There is a non-zero chance you'll succeed wildly, and find a life that is novel and successful. But you'll be the exception, not the rule.",1348808359

Yet, in a few decades, they were able to overcome the discrimination and even best whites as a whole.<p>Much of that appears to me culture based, not even ethnicity based.  Now, not all Asians do well and have the same aptitude toward education and sacrifice.  Compare East Asians with SouthEast Asians with Island Asians.  Still, from my exposure, there is a large percentage whose parents inculcate learning and education and sacrifice (ex. Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother as modern example).  On the other hand look at Appalachian whites.  Education is made fun of and they are some of the poorest people in America.<p>Essentially, make education and learning something held dear and worthwhile.  Many other white kinds I went to school with were apathetic towards education (these guys are now laying carpets and driving trucks and so on).  It's totally different mindset comapred to say, ABCs.  They might not ""like"" school, but they know it's a means to and end rather than an obstacle to having fun.",1348808118

4584362,comment,4584201,4584201,31,0,luu,,,"<i>There are a lot of mediocre and flat bad programmers out there because were knocking down the barriers and letting everyone in, plus they have all sorts of crutches they can lean on now.</i><p>This is an incredibly good sign. Jeremy's statement translates to two things.<p>1. Factor productivity in programming is so high that even ""mediocre and bad programmers"" can make a net positive contribution to the economy.<p>2. Barriers to entry are low.<p>Would we want to change either of these things? Surely no one is going to argue that we should prefer lower factor productivity.<p>So, what about barriers to entry? If you look at industries that have '1' but not '2', you have a small set of very rich people keeping people out of the industry in order to protect their riches. This makes everyone else in the world poorer, because the service is artificially expensive, and it's especially bad for the ""bad and mediocre"" people who could have otherwise made it in the industry. The main benefit of creating high barriers to entry would be to make people who are already rich by the standard of the one of the richest countries in the world, in the most prosperous time in human history, even richer. Why should we want that?<p>It's great that some people think of programming as a craft and continually do everything they can to improve their skills; I can completely understand the attitude, since it's one I have myself. But, not everyone is like that. Some people would rather spend time doing other things. What's really amazing is that we're so rich and productive that someone can put almost no effort into learning how to program and still be a productive member of society. I love it that we live in a country where people can work 1/100th as hard as an employee in a Foxconn factory and produce more value. I hope that my kids will be able to be ten times richer than me while working one-tenth as hard. I pray that they'll choose to work harder than that, but I want it to be a choice.<p>It is a wondrous and amazing thing that total factor productivity[1] is so high in the U.S. that unskilled Mexican laborers become three times more productive when they cross the border; keep in mind that Mexico is, on a global scale, one of the more productive nations in the world.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_factor_productivity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_factor_productivity</a>",1348808036

No company can live up to this kind of scrutiny. The same thing happen when the iPhone 4 came out, and the iPhone 4s, and these are very very nice phones, even today.

If it were my own startup, I'd try to hire from the population I've personally worked with, avoiding this whole discussion anyway.  And I have never worked in an organization with a hiring quota - the companies I've worked for will all take you if you meet the hiring bar, and hold cash in reserve so they can scoop up a suitably-qualified employee if one presents herself.  For that matter, I've been given offers at several places that were ""not hiring"", so I'm guessing quotas are just guidelines in many other places as well.)",1348807679

4584344,comment,4584201,4584201,6,0,fusiongyro,,,"One thing I think is important to keep in mind is that standards were also a lot lower back then. Seeing a Lisp Machine in person, when you hit the bottom of the interactive terminal it would just start overwriting the top of the screen. For me, it was a surprising reminder that a lot of things we <i>really</i> take for granted today were considered superfluous in the past.<p>For as much as things are easier today, what non-programmers consider acceptable (""the bar,"" if you will) has been raised more. The idea of full-time user experience people in the 1980s would have been ridiculous. Today we have ""front end engineers"" who are mainly there to inform and realize the interactions designed by full-time user experience people. For a significant amount of time, networking meant network filesystems and email. Today it means multi-million lines of code browsers running thousands to hundreds of thousands of lines of front-end code with just as much or more in the backend.<p>Programmers before us did more with less, true. But they also were more willing to accept compromises. I think things would probably be a lot better today if people's expectations were lower. But Plan 9 and Haiku are evidence that people actually care quite a bit more about usability than stability. It's a bummer.

4584333,comment,4584201,4584201,20,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I'm not sure what I think of this. (I started programming around 1985.)<p>I don't think the older generation of programmers were any better than the younger generation in terms of skill. I think they were, generally, more <i>practical</i> -- they don't generally engage in language wars or programming evangelism, but when they do, they speak directly from a massive body of experience that's hard to argue with.<p>I think that the problems that they spent most of their time on were generally simpler. The most challenging bit of magic I ever worked on a mainframe was convincing COBOL to do variable interpolation on what was essentially punchcard-data-on-disk. (COBOL has no string operators or variable types, for those that are unfamiliar.) That was challenging, but it was a tiny problem in terms of scope compared to, say, building a scalable web application with a database backend.<p>I've worked with and hung out with greybeards, and generally prefer their company to that of hyperactive younger programmers. (For one thing, they don't talk about programming much!) They built things the same way we do -- by thinking about it and then banging it out one line at a time. They just used different tools.<p>Documentation was better back when. That's one thing I really don't appreciate about the Google Era; now, if I need information on some function or language feature, I usually end up reading some incomplete community-submitted documentation and a stack of opinions from people who may or may not know what they're talking about. For anybody that got to use those lovely old massive 3-ring binders (they came in sets!) with professionally-written and compiled in-depth documentation covering every single aspect of whatever you were using, there's just no modern replacement.<p>Otherwise, I don't really think the field of computer programming has fundamentally changed in all these years. The people are about the same. (Greenblatt was a pretty annoying, hyperactive young programmer once.) Some things are different. Some things aren't.",1348807111

I have no idea quite how intensive the review process is (I'm no Windows programmer, so the requirements don't mean much to me) but any additional barrier is something that holds back the finnicky and decentralized indie crowd. Not only will it present another technical barrier that they will have no interest in surpassing, but there will likely be a cultural and psychological backlash of having to certify their version 0 project with Microsoft. Not to mention how certification requirements would impact beta releases and feedback.",1348805030

Google is behaving inconsistently with what they say, and that makes Google a less-than-reliable partner in open source cooperation.<p>Acer was slapped down, yet Haier, also an OHA member, makes both Aliyun and Android devices.<p>Google claims Aliyun is ""incompatible"" and also claims Alibaba is stealing apps, or, at least, distributing them without the developers' permission. So, which is it?<p>Numerous OHA participate in the OPhone OS development and use. OPhone is roughly equivalent to Aliyun, and is used by China Mobile. Ophone good, but Aliyun bad?<p>The problem is arbitrariness. For each one of Google's justifications for yanking Acer's chain, there is something in Google's track record that is inconsistent.",1348805008

There are a number of people that are all well-qualified for the job, and any one of them can do it as well as any other.<p>It's not necessarily true when you compare <i>between</i> organizations, where different groups may make subtly different decisions with wildly different outcomes (although even then, a lot of the difference comes from different circumstances and not innate talent of the people involved).  But in an organization, the need for teamwork and to ""row in a common direction"" tends to flatten out individual differences, and there're generally two possible classes: ""valued contributor"" and ""holding back the group"".<p>(This is also why large organizations like Google tweak their hiring processes to avoid false positives more than false negatives.  One bad hire forces the team down to his level, as they always have to stop and explain things to him, or he'll block them from implementing a cleverer solution that he wouldn't understand.  One good hire, however, very rarely <i>raises</i> the level of the team - he needs a lot of patience and very good empathetic & people skills to do so.)",1348804917

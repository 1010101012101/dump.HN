3496649,comment,3496339,3496528,4,0,Vivtek,,,"<i>most movie goers would just wait</i><p>Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. Moviegoers <i>love to go to movies</i>, and movie downloaders are the same guys that wait a week in line for the new Star Wars.  Perfect customers, in other words.<p>Did you know our town had a second-run movie theater until last year?  One of the last towns to have one.  They were packed all the time - but the new owners of <i>all the theaters in town</i> closed it because people could watch movies on the cheap instead of paying eight bucks at the plex.  Now everything's only open for about five weeks and is then gone forever.<p>I'm a busy man.  My schedule often required going to the second-run because I literally <i>cannot focus on chunks of time of five weeks</i> to see a movie.  Now, my only recourse is to wait a year or so for the studios to release a version of that movie I can buy, or pirate it.  Sometimes I pirate it, even though I freaking loathe Bittorrent and the hassle involved in finding a good pirate copy.<p>But I don't have a choice.  And I <i>love movies</i>.  I love Pirates of the Caribbean - my wife actually saw the first one in the cinema nearly thirty times.  Once she showed up five minutes late for the evening showing and the attendant just laughed and waved her into the theater instead of opening up the cash register again, knowing she'd be back the following night.  So after it closed in the movie theater, I downloaded it to continue watching it - then we bought it as soon as they decided to sell it to us, wore out one copy, and bought another.<p>Do you think I'm atypical?  Yet Hollywood thinks <i>I cheated them</i> by downloading Pirates of the Caribbean.<p>If movie attendance is down, it's not because people are waiting to see a pirated videocam version they downloaded, it's because real prices have doubled or tripled and people simply no longer have the money to go to the movies as often.  In a recession, no less.  Next the MPAA is just going to garnish everybody's wages on suspicion of piracy.<p>(If they actually do that, please don't blame me for thinking of it first...)",1327243992

3496645,comment,3496339,3496339,17,0,hxa7241,,,"Copyright economics has one basic question: is the public getting plenty of good 'content'? And this has two components: 1, is plenty of stuff being produced?; and 2, does the public have easy and cheap access to it? This is just the standard economic structure; look it up: <a href=""http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/IPCoop/89land1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/IPCoop/89land1.html</a><p>Now we can see that the common statements about the 'problem' of piracy are misconceived (often deliberately of course). The only proper problem that could exist here is if the public are being poorly served: by insufficient content or expensive/difficult access.<p>Industry bodies complain that their companies are 'losing' money. That is a nonsensical use of the word 'losing'. What they mean is they are not making as much as they <i>think they should</i>. But the purpose of copyright does not care about what they like to imagine, it cares about the two question above. If enough content is being produced, then by definition the companies producing it are being paid enough.<p>(And piracy is actually a direct positive for the economy, since it helps with the second question: it gives the public better, cheaper access to content -- indeed, just what industry bodies have been obstructing by buying legislation.)<p>So is there a decline of production? Well, those claiming, or rather implying, there is cannot provide any evidence, so why listen to them? And we can at least simply look around to get a rough idea. Do you feel there are less movies/music/books now, compared with say 10 years ago? That certainly does not <i>seem</i> very sensible.<p>And another notable point is this: these industries say they have been suffering a terrible onslaught of piracy for about 10 years now, yet there appears to be no decline of production. Now there are two possible deductions from that: either they are talking nonsense, and/or the current level of copyright has been strongly proved to be unnecessary. If production has stayed sufficient, yet copyright has de facto been reduced, we obviously do not <i>need</i> that level of copyright.",1327243914

3496642,comment,3495759,3496039,18,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>Maybe I'm just a calculating, cold, emotionless engineer but when it comes to pay packages I've stopped caring about the fancy 'perks'. I only try to gauge how much I'll get paid, how much I'll enjoy the work and learn, and how many hours I'll be putting in.</i><p>Well, that's normal and smart. You go to work for the work, not the diversions. I don't think I've ever played an XBox during working hours; if there's any possibility that I'll be more interested in XBox than in doing my job at 11:30 am, there are bigger issues, either with me or with the job.<p>What happens as you get older is that you learn to see through the bullshit. Things that matter: career development, interesting work, co-workers you'll learn from, fairness, recognition, company vision, and a functioning management environment. Things that don't: perks you can buy on the market for a couple hundred bucks.<p><i>Free food and onsite amenities usually is a sign that they want you there for extra long hours and that you'll probably need to use that stuff.</i><p>I can look at this one both ways. If the company will do my laundry for me, it saves me 30 minutes a week. I'll gladly spend an additional 30 minutes on work (which I generally enjoy) in exchange for not having to do 30 minutes of chores. That said, even better would be to have the perk in extra cash so I can buy my own housework services (which two adults with demanding careers will have to do anyway).<p><i>Unrestricted vacation days can mean you don't really get any vacation because its always crunch time.</i><p>There's a non-evil incentive for companies to switch to untracked vacation. It saves them money on vacation cash-in, and it also removes the economic incentive for employees not to take any vacation. A $100,000-per-year job with two weeks of paid vacation is actually equivalent to a $104,000 job without paid vacation and with penalties for taking more than 10 days off. The ""two weeks' paid vacation"" is actually a Hawaiian Shirt Day, a negative space establishing that ""career"" people won't take more time off than that (since unpaid leave is frowned upon).<p>Truly untracked vacation (meaning that if you take 6 weeks' worth of vacation but do 15% better work in the other 46, you're in good standing) is worth a 5-10% pay cut for me.<p>The best way to learn the value of money (immense when you don't have enough, but very low once you have enough of it) is to work on Wall Street for a few years and learn first-hand that millionaires (and ""millionaire"" means $1m/year, not $1m net worth) aren't any happier than the rest of us. I actually think it can be invaluable for some people to work in the vicinity of seriously rich people just to learn that lesson.<p><i>Fancy employee outings are not so thrilling to me - I like my coworkers but I already spend the majority of my waking hours with them.</i><p>I'm with you. I'm 28, married, and will probably be having kids in 4-6 years. Office Christmas parties don't appeal to me. I'd rather spend the time with my friends or family.<p>It's great to hang out with your co-workers after work. I've learned an incredible amount from after-work drinks and (now that I can't tolerate alcohol, for health reasons) discussions in classes and board-game nights. But it should be organic and elective. I don't like the ""forced"" kind-- the socially mandatory drinking that you see in finance, the wild office Christmas parties. I can see the appeal of that stuff at 22, but not at 28 (much less 35+).",1327243850

302006,comment,301853,301915,0,0,furiouslol,,,"Takeaway point is similar to what the others have said:<p>- Learn from your competition and differentiate yourself from them<p>- There are competitors all the time. So learn to live with them and out-execute them.<p>- Being late to the party is not a problem as long as you execute well (See dropbox)<p>Another good example is Box.net. They were in a crowded space. They were not first but they differentiate themselves from the competition by offering an easy + social UI that makes sharing fun. It all boils down to execution.<p>Good luck with your project!",1221184470

He seems concerned about hype, so maybe he thinks that that the hype might be moving from Ruby to Javascript.<p>FWIW, I don't think Ruby is going away anytime soon.",1221184012

The language has also been slow to evolve to fix core problems with it due to the fact that any changes need to be agreed with by the major browser vendors.

You've seen your fair share of them) promising something different but in the end, they offer nothing compelling over the current services.<p>It's like someone saying they want to build a craigslist killer because of all sort of cool features that they can't do with craigslist.

There are some cool features that they can't do with craigslist like advanced filtering but these are not compelling enough to differentiate themselves.",1221182632

The online photo situation is so huge that there might even be a few, or many other people who like what I've built. If so, great. If not - I don't care, I built something I wanted to build. It isn't going to be radically different, just ""sort of"" different. Hopefully fun, too.<p>Sometimes I think hacker attitudes are way too dramatic. ""Precious development time"", ""... my baby."" Discouraging projects unless they are ""radically different."" Commit 100% or don't bother! Utmost passion and dedication to your online power saving widget! GO BIG OR GO HOME!<p>A lot of really good software was created on a lark. Some of it even became financially successful. It doesn't need to be quit your job and drop out of school to make the next Google (using Haskell, this time) or else you're wasting your time.<p>That said, at my day job I have genetically engineered biomolecules to act as a massively parallel neural network which can design new derivative investment instruments on the fly and corner the market on them before other hedge funds even know they exist. As a clever side-effect, this process unearths retrotransposon based cures for AIDS hidden in ""junk DNA"". My work has been ""certified green"" because the biological residue from the computations can be dumped onto ocean oil spills and automatically transform the petroleum into vegan friendly biodiesel which swims to shore on its own.  I have also hacked my roomba to perform an advanced form of lasik surgery which restores sight and plan on sending it on a world tour to communities in the rain forest afflicted with ""river blindness."" Hopefully these advances in the state of the art more than make up for the time I'm wasting on my boring photo site.<p>EDIT: gotta give a shout out to my homies at CERN for hooking one of my molecules up with a free trip to the 11th dimension after they find the higgs. thanks, guys!",1221182511

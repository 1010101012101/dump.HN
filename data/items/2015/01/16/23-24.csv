8902574,comment,8902071,8902071,0,0,tegeek,,,"I grew up in a remote rural area of a third world country. My mother & father taught me to read. And I developed interest in reading books at the age of 6 or 7.<p>When I was 9 or 10 years old, someone (may be my cousin or my fathers&#x27; uncle) gave me a book on simple electronics (it was in my native language). That was the first time I read about P-Type & N-Type materials and some other physics. It was so fascinated to me that I used to read it all the time to understand. The book also included about very simple digital logic design and concepts like NAND Gate etc.<p>I didn&#x27;t understood at all what it is all about. But It developed my interest in Physics and Electronics.<p>By the age of 13 or 14 I learned myself about soldering, creating very simple chips and some LEDs on-off work. I never learned any math or could develop any mental model about true electronics but all that work created an infinite desire to know about the nature of &quot;materials&quot; & physics behind everything.<p>My parents put me in school which was 12 KM from my village, I used to bike every day 24 KM two way with some other friends no matter if it was summer with 43 degrees or winter with -2 degrees. And I was just 9 years old young kid. I started skipping school and start searching more books like that great Electronics books. I bought many but couldn&#x27;t understand the foundations at all.<p>That same book had chapters how you can create a sequence of LEDs which keep going on & off one after other and make some interesting visual. I opened every electronic device at home and tried to understand its chips but couldn&#x27;t get at all what is going on.<p>None of my friends studies beyond class 8 but I kept going. I started studying physics at the age of 15 at school but it was all so bookish and memorisation that I never liked school at all.<p>But I studied Physics, Biology & Chemistry myself and enjoyed every single moment of that time. That was the only time I studied Sciences and developed an intuition about the scientific world.<p>My parents took loan and sent me to a bigger city for my Bachelors degree. But the education was so artificial that I couldn&#x27;t learn anything more at all. Every single book was in English (which is not my native or national language) I feel so empty & everything useless. At the same time my parents were sending me more money than they could afford.<p>I went into depression & at some point in my Bachelors&#x27; degree I found out about Internet & &quot;Software&quot;. \nI started learning about Web Site development. I learned HTML, Adobe Dreamweaver & Fireworks. Then I learned a bit of C++ & C#. (I remember I started learning about C# in April 2002).<p>I got a job as a programmer in an off-shore office of a USA company. I then saved some money and escaped from that country and came to Sweden because of free education.<p>I studied Computer Science & developed an intense love with Mathematics (even though I&#x27;m not good in maths) & Programming Languages. Now I&#x27;m working as a Software Engineer but I have deep love with Electronics & Physics. And that all goes back to the days when I was reading that simple electronics book.",1421452463

8902568,comment,8902071,8902436,0,0,dxbydt,,,"True, but a lot of chemistry is mostly math too, and I flunked organic chemistry the first time. I think its because there is some domain knowledge involved in these subjects, which you have to actually care about. I don&#x27;t particularly care which element has how many isotopes and what the valency is and how many other elements it can bond with, though I did memorize the atomic weights of all the elements in the periodic table and Avogardo number and few such stats. Those things helped a little, because I was ultimately able to pass my chemistry exams just by solving the numerical stuff and ignoring the chemical stuff. I handled physics in same fashion . There&#x27;s something called the distance equation, where you can express the distance travelled by particle in terms of velocity and acceleration. We had to simply memorize that and use it in problems. I forgot what it was in the exam. So I just derived it from definitions. The teacher was quite surprised, because at that stage we hadn&#x27;t been taught  calculus, so how did I derive it ?

Just put the plate on the scale and press &quot;tare&quot;. This resets the scale to zero. Then put on some bread: the scale now measures the bread only. Press &quot;tare&quot; again, and spread some butter on the bread: the scale now measures the butter only, etc.<p>In this way, measuring each ingredient requires very little effort.<p>MyFitnessPal makes logging easy. I scan the bar codes of the food I buy and the nutrient content is automatically downloaded from the web.<p>Ingredients that are used before are easily available from a list (your local database), so you don&#x27;t need to scan bar codes every time you eat. (With vegetables and fruits, the bar code is only available in the store.)<p>It&#x27;s also possible to bundle the ingredients into &quot;meals&quot; (a set of ingredients and amounts). So that you can add whole meals to your log with a single click.<p>Since you can log entries in advance, it&#x27;s also possible to &quot;budget&quot; future calories, and it&#x27;s easy to make changes to it.<p>E.g.: having oatmeal for breakfast. I click the meal &quot;Oatmeal&quot; from the app. The individual ingredients of the meal are automatically logged (80 grams Oatmeal, 300 grams milk, 30 grams strawberry jam).<p>I put my cereal bowl on my scale. Press tare, and measure out 80 grams Oatmeal. Press tare again, and measure out 30 grams jam. And press tare and measure out 300 grams milk.<p>If I use something else instead of jam that particular meal, it&#x27;s easy to change single ingredients. E.g., delete the jam and add nuts.<p>It&#x27;s not a perfect method, since it does not work for food bought in a restaurant or from the cafeteria at work, etc.<p>Btw, congrats on sticking it out for so long! :D",1421452237

They are still competing it out for your business over wired even though Google Fiber may be in even higher demand.<p>However, part of the promise of getting $200B in investment/breaks was to finish building out the wired side, which really has not been done and is now harming us competitively with the world.  Part of their promise was to spend it on the less demand areas of wired. Had they built out fiber and competed there would be more demand for it. Google Fiber is in high demand and all Google is doing is using broadband late 90s playbook, just give the people faster speeds and whole unrealized economies emerge that our GDP has been missing for a decade during wireless laser focus.",1421452164

I thought he was part of the latter group.<p>Some programmers are engineers: they deal with the world as it is -- messy, inconsistent, evolved.  They are good at debugging, because they are in tune with how things actually work (not how people SAY they work.)  They like trying things before reading about them.<p>Some programmers are philosophers and mathematicians: they like to consider things from first principles, read a lot, and build up systems in their head.  They make huge breakthroughs because they question fundamental assumptions.  But sometimes they over-model things and ignore how the world actually works, in favor of &quot;elegant&quot; ideas.  They may not like debugging because it is often dealing with other people&#x27;s broken assumptions (i.e. legacy code), and not any real fundamental idea.<p>So PG clearly seems to have the philosophical bent and has made breakthroughs.  But if he really likes debugging, then that means he comes at programming from BOTH the engineering and philosophical traditions, which probably explains why he&#x27;s a great programmer.  (I just stumbled across a copy of ANSI Common Lisp at work -- looking forward to seeing his style more closely.)<p>I think to be really good at something, you have to understand it in two different ways.  Same goes for being able to write code from scratch (maker perspective) and being able to hack into it (breaker perspective).<p>Although, I have to say, there is a big difference between debugging your OWN code and other people&#x27;s code.

Things only got irksome if I indulged in comparing my new skill to my skill level in programming, despairing at the difference, or if an injury prevented me from doing it for awhile.

I&#x27;d actively pick the brains of any teacher in high school who gave off even a hint of understanding programming or anything related. Once I&#x27;d learned everything about digital logic and did all I could on the broken Heathkit boards, my electronics teacher bought a computer for the electronics shop and let me take over his office just to get me to stop bothering him.

We&#x27;ve worked on a couple ways to better describe this -- the two components of both creating content passively/in the background, and using that info as a springboard into messaging -- and other ideas were &quot;contextual messenger,&quot; &quot;automatic away message,&quot; and &quot;passive messenger.&quot; It&#x27;s been tough to find a description that captures those two elements -- any preferences based on those alternatives (or ideas)?<p>2. Definitely a fair point -- &quot;background messenger&quot; is the quick couple word decriptor (as in, Facebook is a social network), and &quot;A window into your best friends&#x27; lives / Waldo keeps you in the loop, all the time&quot; is the value prop we&#x27;re trying to convey. I think you make a good point, though, that bridging those two needs work.<p>3. This has been one of the more interesting challenges -- getting away from the notion that it&#x27;s for spying on / being spied on. The goal of the app is to help you stay connected to the most important people in your life by providing an authentic window into their world, wherever they may be, without them having to manually update all the time.<p>So we make sure of three things: one, you&#x27;re only sharing high-level location (ie it&#x27;s &#x27;Out in SOMA&#x27; and not your dot on a map), and you can go hidden whenever you like. Two, there&#x27;s no feed or history, it&#x27;s only real-time -- so there&#x27;s no &quot;where was Tom last Tuesday&quot; kind of thing anyone can do. And three, it&#x27;s with a close-knit group of people -- it&#x27;s a very different audience than public/FB friends/Twitter followers, and you can block anyone you don&#x27;t want.<p>We&#x27;re seeing people use it to save a text when coordinating (see if someone&#x27;s already on their way) and also, more interestingly, to stay in rhythm with people they&#x27;re close with who may not by nearby -- instead of a 30 minute call to parents or a sibling recounting the week, people use it to feel closer to what those close friends and family are up to when they can&#x27;t be there, and then have richer interactions when they do connect.<p>Appreciate you checking it out and the feedback -- hope this helps explain some, and I definitely hear you on explaining the value proposition more clearly.

But this part of the process tends to get neglected, and eventually a point is reached where you can either a) break stuff at run-time in unpredictable ways, b) stop refactoring and deal with the consequences, or c) have a <i>proper</i> suite of unit tests. c) requires almost as much discipline as keeping the code clean in the first place, and a) or b) are not great options.<p>Luckily TypeScript helps out quite a lot and basically for free. Converting an existing JavaScript project to &quot;naive&quot; TypeScript takes hardly any effort, and as the project evolves it is easy to add type annotations and interfaces at any pace. Once a module is properly typed it (almost) stops breaking at run-time, yay! It&#x27;s also very clear what will be executing in the browser. Using a cross-compiled language that follows the principle of least astonishment is a real treat.<p>Obviously it can&#x27;t prevent compile-time errors, generate unit tests, or build a good application for you, but you do get quite a lot of help with the problems it can solve.",1421450633

Section 23 specifically mentions &quot;on suspicion of fraud&quot; and section 24 mentions &quot;reason to suspect any goods, wares or merchandise subject to duty shall be concealed&quot;. It was not a blank allowance to search everyone at the border, particularly it did not allow for the searching of people leaving.

Additionally, the act in section 23 specifically allowed for third party review of the search by requiring that the search be done with the oversight of &quot;two or more reputable merchants&quot;.

I just said that\n(1) their graph data was good but (2) their\nconcern about extreme values was bad.  Both\n(1) and (2) are plainly obvious and need no\n&quot;counter-evidence&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t\ntrust the NYT, but I didn&#x27;t say that they\nwere &quot;lying&quot;.<p>> making empty claims<p>I made no claims except the obvious one that\nthe NYT was emphasizing extreme values which,\nclearly for such data analysis, is wrong.<p>The <i>argument</i> about <i>global warming</i> is\ntotally clear, &quot;settled&quot;:  No one knows \nwhat the climate will be in 10, 50, or\n100 years for any scenarios having to do with\nhumans.<p>Proof:  Look at the results of the climate\ncomputer models; they are in fairly good agreement\nand predicted that today the temperatures would\nbe much higher.  They were wildly wrong.  QED<p>Why were the models so wrong?  For the technical\npart, assuming that the work was done honestly\n(and I don&#x27;t really believe that), Freeman\nDyson has a remark, I don&#x27;t recall precisely,\nthat maybe the problem was the models didn&#x27;t\ndo well modeling the effects of the biological\nresponses or some such.  So, maybe they did well\nenough with the Navier-Stokes equations, Planck\nblack body radiation, sun spots, etc. but blew it\non green leafy vegetables.  But, at least from\nFreeman Dyson, we don&#x27;t know.<p>Why would the NYT emphasize extreme values?\nThat&#x27;s not a scientific or technical question\nand, instead, is about their motivations.\nMy guess about their motivations, YMMV and no\ntechnical references needed, is that they\nwant to pass out <i>drama</i> to get attention\nfor their ads.  Believe it or not.  But\na long time ago people saw that truth and the\nnewspapers were not good bedfellows:<p>Evidence:\nAn Andy Hardy movie from the 1930s\nwhere, clearly, the audience accepted\nthat newspapers passed out nonsense.\nMore?  Sure, <i>Citizen Kane</i>, which a lot\nof people can find believable.<p>For the sources of the NYT, I didn&#x27;t see\nany mentioned.  Sorry to say, at this point,\ngiven Obama&#x27;s political positions, I can\nno longer take data from NASA or NOAA very\nseriously, but that is not a biggie in this\ncase.  I didn&#x27;t claim that the extreme\nvalues were wrong, just that, when we do have\naverage data, for the data analysis in \nquestion here, extreme values add nothing\nbut confusion.  Here I am on very solid\nground:  Clearly the temperature is a\n<i>stochastic process</i>; commonly we get new\nextreme values right along\neven if nothing is really\nchanging.  There are some quite precise\nresults in the cases of coin flipping,\nBrownian motion, and martingales.\nWhat would be surprising would be that\nwe didn&#x27;t get new extreme values --\nif we never got more extreme values,\nthen we would have some bounds for the\nprocess that we would have a tough\ntime believing.<p>&quot;Anomaly&quot; is still the wrong word.\nActually, with a good meaning of <i>anomaly</i>,\nwe should just f&#x27;get about them;\nthat is, they are <i>anomalies</i>, and in that\ncase the whole NYT article is moot.<p>Yes, I mentioned that it is common in\nthis global warming mud wrestling to say\n<i>anomaly</i> -- it&#x27;s still the wrong word.\n<i>Critical reading comprehension 101</i> \nwould have us conclude, correctly in my\nview, that here <i>anomaly</i> is intended to\nmean not really from nature but from\nhumans and their evil CO2, and that is\n<i>value-heavy</i>.  Or, the suggestion is that\nthere is a reason for the <i>anomaly</i>, and\ntheir claim of the reason is human CO2.\nSend your money now to your favorite\ngreen political pressure group.",1421450138

8902381,comment,8900880,8900880,0,0,jeddawson,,,"I’ve having a hard time figuring out how this is actually going to be any different than the existing “brokerage” services that are common in the solid waste industry. I really hope I’m wrong because this industry is ready for an operational overhaul and I would love someone from Rubicon to jump in here and point out where they are different.<p>Waste Management purchased one of the largest solid waste brokers in the nation (OakLeaf) in 2011 [1] and through that acquisition now brokers sold waste and recycling collection services to smaller collection companies across the nation. Large national brands like those mentioned sub out the management of collection contracts for their individual location’s waste services to Waste Management’s brokerage division. This sounds just like the business model described for Rubicon.<p>One of their primary claims that I’m having a hard time with is the claim that current haulers just want to landfill material because that’s the most cost effective disposal method. I’m in a unique position to say most of my clients (private haulers) are not solely looking to landfill material. They’re already trying very hard to extract extra value for the materials they collection so they’ll be more competitive when bidding. Some of them own landfills. Some of them don’t. Most of them landfill material as a last resort.<p>I absolutely believe there is opportunity here and hope Rubicon’s distinguishing characteristics were simply missing from this article or somehow under represented.<p>Also, I’m thrilled that HN has a post about garbage mixed with technology. That’s a combo that I’m incredibly passionate about and love the opportunity to get this community more involved in.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.wm.com/documents/pdfs/oakleaf.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wm.com/documents/pdfs/oakleaf.pdf</a>",1421449715

(For example, Taylor Swift&#x27;s latest album is titled &#x27;1989&#x27; and has an 80s-influenced feel to many of the songs.) In the 80s, there was a bunch of 50s influence. Billy Joel had released &quot;Uptown Girl&quot; and the rest of an album of almost doo-wop pop hits. Grease was a hit movie in 1978, just a few years earlier. You could still catch shows like Happy Days, Laverne and Shirley, and Hee-Haw on TV. So I think it&#x27;s just a matter of what you remember. I watched and listened to all that stuff and the 50s still seemed like ancient history to me. (My parents were barely teenagers in the 50s!)",1421449700

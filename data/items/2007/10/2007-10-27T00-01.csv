I find this attitude dispiriting. How are people going to realize better forms of computing if they're discouraged from looking at the good stuff? How are we going to solve the problem of 80-90% of software projects failing if people are only encouraged to use mediocre technology. This isn't good for society.<p>I see some of this same attitude in the Squeak (Smalltalk) community, though it's not as bad. People are more willing to share it with others.",1193443201

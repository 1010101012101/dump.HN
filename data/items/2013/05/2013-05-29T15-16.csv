These attempts to improve the process by probing and influencing behavior outside the classroom grossly oversteps appropriate boundaries.<p>The information being demanded (and, where possible, anyone advocating not complying is being punished) is subject to naive, ignorant, bigoted, and biased interpretation by people not trained, hired, nor authorized (by parents) to interpret that information, yet those same people are empowered to act on their interpretations with severe consequences up to and including ""reprogramming""[1], expulsion, and prosecution. Some of the information revealed seems persuasively permissible (""are you currently a user of illegal hard drugs?""), but many are subject to gross misinterpretation of answers (""have you ever consumed alcohol?"" ""yes"", not explained as in fact a tiny amount a few times during Communion at church). The context is inappropriate and veiled, the answers viewed without parental permission, a permanent record is made, and ""anything you say can be used against you in a court of law"".<p>tl;dr - none of their business.

5787000,comment,5786291,5786832,6,0,thedufer,,,"I agree with the first half of your comment - the ""deliberate"" in ""deliberate practice"" is definitely necessary to understand what the 10,000 hour rule means.<p>However, I think you take it too far at the end.  To say that the nature half of nurture+nature is unnecessary goes against a significant amount of research.  In sports, this becomes pretty clear.  What are the odds that short people never work hard enough to become good swimmers, for example?  It seems drastically more likely that nature has an enormous impact.  10,000 hours of deliberate practice is necessary, but by no means sufficient, for success at most sports.<p>It is less obvious in other domains, but there is still research to the effect that some people simply aren't wired for certain things, just like short people are can't swim at world-class levels.  In HN's favorite domain, programming, there is reason to believe that some people simply can't think in the right way.

But as the article shows, people are inclined to give a lot of reasons that don't hold up. There's a pattern to who's giving the reasons and who's on the receiving end that suggest that there's something else going on.<p>For example, ""like"" is often used as a replacement for ""um"" or ""er"". But ""like"" bothers me more. And different cultures have different noises for that; one of my small delights is figuring out what country somebody is from by which noise they use to indicate that they are holding the floor but need a second to think. I actively enjoy those, even though they're equally low-signal. And there's a lot of word-compression slang (e.g., ""totes"" for ""totally"", ""prolly"" for ""probably"") that increases the signal, so in theory I'd like it.<p>Thinking about it, a lot of the linguistic features that really bother me are exactly what the NORM pattern indicates: I don't like the ones from people with lower social standing. E.g., ""ain't"" as a class marker. I'm inclined to argue for the ones that privilege me (educated older white male), and against the ones that don't.",1369843098

5786988,comment,5784110,5785098,1,0,nathannecro,,,"I'm fully aware of the PNAS paper (and others like it which have been published). Let me point out a few other times in history where scientists, without clear evidence for their beliefs, were wrong:<p>When Galileo championed the idea of heliocentrism, the vast majority of all other astronomers during his time opposed his views. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei</a><p>The idea of phlogiston was quite prevalent in the chemistry community for about a century before it was definitively proved to be a pile of combustible turds. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory</a><p>Even recently, in the early 20th century, physicists believed that:
a) The smallest particle of matter (the atom) had been quantified, measured, and fully explored.
b) There was no more to discover in the field of physics.
Clearly, they were wrong.<p>Let me rephrase my objection more clearly.
I believe that the Earth's climate (across all biomes) has been rapidly shifting over recent time.
I know that humans can impact local ecosystems and one of the results is a shift in local climate.
I have yet to see evidence for (cum hoc ergo propter hoc is a danger when looking at studies) humans causing climate change on a global scale.<p>This does not mean that we should stop our efforts to prevent deforestation. Nor does it mean we should ignore local environmental disasters, but linking local impact to global impact has not been done definitively yet, so as a scientist, I question that belief. It is not out of arrogance that I question, but out of the desire to be a better scientist. I am trained to base my beliefs in: Hypothesis -> Evidence -> Examination -> Belief. What we do have currently is a very good ""guesstimate"" hypothesis (we observe that humans can cause local ecosystem shifts). What we do not have is evidence. And thus, we do not have the opportunity for discussion or the transition to belief.",1369843070

5786929,comment,5785759,5786006,25,0,hga,,,"Mr. Church is absolutely right, and I have a telling story from the decline and fall of Lucent to back it up:<p>The last project I worked on was something <i>essential</i> to Lucent's survival as an independent entity.  Many of you have heard of sophisticated telephone switches, like the Western Electric (AT&T) then Lucent 5ESS (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5ESS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5ESS</a>), a really impressive monster that's truly 5 9's reliable (or it genuinely tried to be and by and large made the grade).<p>The new way of doing this is (or was as of 2001) to split the functions of such a switch into a Media Gateway Controller AKA Call Agent e.g. the Lucent Softswitch, which understands things like billing, and a Media Controller which does the actual work of connecting A to B and converting as needed (e.g. POTS to VoIP).  There's even a dual ITU/IETF protocol for communications between the two, Megaco AKA H.248 AKA RFC 2805.<p>It should be obvious that being able to offer a complete solution was essential for Lucent's future, as conventional switch sales were at least projected to plummet, and my group was part of effort to create the other half the company needed, the Media Controller.  Which was a challenging thing, including that true 5 9s reliability requirement (just say no to hard disks, I was among other things the database guy in testing, and the operational database lead and I had to vet and sign off on each other's designs (mine was a data warehouse approach for storing fine grained events generated by the test system, Oracle was real fun for that sort of thing and we had a 106,000 seat license (!) from them, although headcount was going down to 35,000), and I was personally responsible for testing his system).<p>ADDED: going off the Yourdon <i>Death March</i> chart included in OP comments, this was a ""mission impossible"" project, high happiness (fun, challenging project), at least a decent chance of success initially (e.g. we were working with the 5ESS people, who taught us a lot of neat stuff about real 5 9s.)<p><i>Anyway</i>, at a certain point, completely insanely a company wide headcount cull was applied to this effort, and I'm pretty sure it was sufficient to kill the project (my testing area was gutted, going from ""maybe, just maybe we can get this work done in time"" to one engineer plus a little outside help, with one manager, a failed programmer so she wasn't of much if any help).<p>One of the things that really stood out was the layoff of a pretty famous person in the company, a jack of all trades who e.g. had the energy and skill to take the chosen (Linux based) RTOS from the vendor and get it up and running in our environments, kick the tires and minimally validate it, etc.  Don't know if he was a PITA like I was in part, but it's hard to imagine he wasn't at least a bit, he was the sort of guy who was in a position to say ""This won't work because I just tried it"".<p>The managers flaunted his layoff like a badge of honor, an implicit ""If this guy can get fired <i>no one is safe</i>"", and <i>blatantly lied about the grounds</i>.  They claimed he was ""inflexible"" about what he'd work on, when it was a very visible matter of written record that he'd very productively work on just about anything.  I never even talked to this guy, I just learned of his background and merits from the written progress reports and mention of him in an occasional conference call meeting, he was perhaps the most visible ""exceptional"" employee in this make or break project.<p>And yet he was purged.<p>(As was I, although that was by abuse from an envious boss and may not have even been part of the headcount cull; while I wasn't hardly so visible, I was the only serious software engineer on the testing effort, and there was no way the company could build the new test system without <i>someone</i> of my caliber.  And you'll never create a true 5 9s system without serious testing.)<p>And as many of you know, the bottom line is that Lucent was bought by Alcetel and is a shade of its former self, including Bell Labs, e.g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs#2000s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs#2000s</a>:<p>""<i>As of July 2008, however, only four scientists remained in physics basic research, according to a report by the scientific journal Nature.<p>On August 28, 2008, Alcatel-Lucent announced it was pulling out of basic science, material physics, and semiconductor research, and it will instead focus on more immediately marketable areas, including networking, high-speed electronics, wireless networks, nanotechnology and software.</i>""",1369842528

        for(Dish d : dishes) {
            Sponge s = getSponge();

How are ""naturally gifted"" persons disserved by thorough research on human performance?<p>This article seems to illustrate the adage that ""the adjective is the enemy of the noun,"" because not once in this excerpt from a longer book is the word ""deliberate"" used, and yet K. Anders Ericsson (an eminent researcher on the development of expertise)<p><a href=""http://www.psy.fsu.edu/faculty/ericsson.dp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psy.fsu.edu/faculty/ericsson.dp.html</a><p>has long taken care to put the adjective ""deliberate"" in front of the word ""practice"" as he writes about how expertise develops. (The article kindly submitted here correctly says, ""<i>New Yorker</i> writer Malcolm Gladwell didnt invent the rule, but he did popularize it through his best-selling book <i>Outliers.</i>"") The 10,000-hour rule, originally formulated as a ten-year rule in studies of musicology a few decades ago, has mostly been researched by Ericsson and other researchers influenced by Ericsson's publications. Ericsson carefully distinguishes ""deliberate practice,"" which ordinarily requires a coach who can monitor the learner's performance, from ""playful engagement,"" which doesn't focus the learner's attention on improved performance in the same way. Many critics of Ericsson's work seem to miss this distinction.<p>I wonder, as an observer of young people learning programming, how much a dumb computer's literal interpretation of programs input into the computer provides relentless deliberate practice in better programming, even for people who are mostly messing around playfully. Perhaps in learning programming, the inanimate computer can serve as a coach for many learners. I would NOT expect someone devoting 10,000 hours to writing essays for fun, if the essays are never read by any critical readers, to improve as much as a writer as someone devoting 10,000 hours to writing programs (if the learner of programmer pays attention to whether the programs compile and run) would improve as a programmer. People who engage in deliberate practice to improve sports performance routinely have coaches, and also participate routinely in competitions that put their assimilation of the sports skills to the test.<p>In general, a lot of people misread the tenor of Ericsson's research, which is the subject of an interesting new book, <i>The Complexity of Greatness,</i> edited by Scott Barry Kaufman.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Complexity-Greatness-Beyond-Practice/dp/0199794006/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Complexity-Greatness-Beyond-Practi...</a><p>Ericsson is sure that raw talent (whatever that is) alone is NOT sufficient to be an ""expert,"" properly so called, but rather has research-based reasons to believe that deliberate practice is strictly necessary for expert performance in all domains. He thinks it is an open question whether or not something like preexisting talent is even necessary for expertise, or whether sustained deliberate practice by itself might be sufficient to make into an expert someone who initially appeared not to have ""talent"" for a particular domain. That is an ongoing program of research, as Ericsson's publications<p><a href=""http://www.psy.fsu.edu/faculty/ericsson.dp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psy.fsu.edu/faculty/ericsson.dp.html</a><p>make clear.<p>And of course Paul Graham had something to say about this issue in his essay ""What You'll Wish You'd Known"" (January 2005).<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/hs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/hs.html</a><p>""Don't think that you can't do what other people can. And I agree you shouldn't underestimate your potential. People who've done great things tend to seem as if they were a race apart. And most biographies only exaggerate this illusion, partly due to the worshipful attitude biographers inevitably sink into, and partly because, knowing how the story ends, they can't help streamlining the plot till it seems like the subject's life was a matter of destiny, the mere unfolding of some innate genius. In fact I suspect if you had the sixteen year old Shakespeare or Einstein in school with you, they'd seem impressive, but not totally unlike your other friends.<p>""Which is an uncomfortable thought. If they were just like us, then they had to work very hard to do what they did. And that's one reason we like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy.

As a hedge word it more generally disclaims that what follows may be inaccurate or metaphorical. It's used in the place of ""to say"" or ""to impart"", filling in for the lack of a word which applies equally to text messages as to speech, with the implication (since it's a hedge) that the quoted speech is likely re- or paraphrased. It can be used as a mild intensifier, as in, ""Okay, but, like...""; despite what you may think, simply adding weight to a phrase can and does alter it semantically. So it's a very versatile word, and there are other uses I've missed. And of course, it is used purely as a stall (er, a disfluency), though not heavily outside of a few dialects.<p>All of this falls under the linguistic study of ""discourse"", the way humans talk in real-world communication with each other. In linguistics, rules of discourse are real and as important as rules of grammar. Nobody uses only ""approved"" words or meanings of words or interactions of words; the ideas human beings communicate are more complex than that.<p>Having laid all that out, I'll say something you'll probably find challenging: the real reason you don't like it is because <i>you don't know what it means</i>.

(For non musicians: ""sight reading"" is the skill of being able to play from music you've never seen before).<p>I am a musician (singer, mostly) and when it comes to sight reading as a singer I would estimate that I'm in the 95th percentile or so.  But I've tinkered with the piano recreationally for basically my whole life, at times more seriously than others, and yet I still cannot sight read on the piano for my life.  There's just too much information for my brain to process in real-time.  I've played some pretty difficult music on the organ, but I have to basically memorize the piece to get to that level.<p>I strongly believe that no amount of time at the piano will make me a good sight reader.

It's not 10,000 hours of practice: it's 10,000 hours of practice at the appropriate level of difficulty -> You need to be taking on tasks that are just slightly beyond what you can do now for most of this time to achieve success.  I also think genetics are not nearly as big a factor as the author makes out to be: there can be plenty of barriers that make it impossible for you to do something, but most of those barriers make it impossible to put 10,000 hours of practice in as well.  There is also a self-fulfilling prophecy in the works here though: 10,000 hours is inevitable if you succeed at something, but most of those who don't succeed will drop the hours (searching for fallback careers, getting jobs, etc..) they dedicate to something along the way and are quite unlikely to reach the number.",1369839711

Maybe I'm the only one here who's worked in the insurance business though...?!<p>A 5-person project with 2 months of work plus another 1.5 months to go is not really that big.  Maybe at a startup that's betting the whole company.  At a large corp that can just be written off.  If the deadline is missed, it just gets re-scheduled.  This is not a freak-out scenario.  The only concern I'd have is letting people know ASAP if you think the deadline is slipping.<p>The other stuff about 100's of tables, no unit tests, other system integrations, etc.  that sounds like every project in an old school large corp.<p>In a large corp, as crappy as these apps are, they can go into use internally and process billions of dollars even though they're crappy to use.

The teachers would then repeatedly make the point that ""there is no double negation in English and you must use 'any' in that case"".<p>Similarly, the use of 'ne' in French is more nuanced. Used alone, it may not convey any negative meaning at all (ne expltif) except when paired with just seven verbs (ne littraire). I would not therefore call 'ne .. pas' a 'double negative'. A double negative would be ""Ce n'est pas rien"" which works the same way as 'I do not disagree' in English. This does not reinforce the negative meaning like in Slavic languages but resolves to a positive instead. In addition, in spoken informal French the 'ne' is often dropped and 'pas' is the only indicative of negation (e.g Je sais pas).<p>The article then goes off on some weird tangent on how patriarchal society feels threatened by the linguistic innovations of the teenage slang.

I bet he would have gotten a bit further.<p>This article really bothers me in its defeatism.  It doesn't do talented people ""a disservice"" to say that anyone can become an expert with 10k hours of practice.  No one will be offended by praising their hard work, and no one is best served by believing that their talent is god-given and they are naturally better than everyone else.  Outside of certain high-profile athletics there simply isn't enough competition to declare oneself abnormally talented in any endeavor.<p>The talent component of success can't be scientifically determined anyway.  The concept of talent itself is amorphous, there is no falsifiable hypothesis to be formulated.  It's not that talent doesn't exist or that hard work is infallible, it's just that a belief in hard work will always result in better outcomes for the believer.",1369839680

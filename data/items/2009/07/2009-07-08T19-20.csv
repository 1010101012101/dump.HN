The redhead analogy is not demonstrating a result of lower social utility.  It is demonstrating a clearly <i>unjust</i> and <i>immoral</i> result to the <i>individuals</i> involved.<p>Here's a serious example:<p>As it so happens, statistical research demonstrates that increased gun ownership generally reduces incidences of home invasion and violent crime.  But if you believe fundamentally in the right of peaceful individuals to defend themselves, their families, and to own firearms, then this is just a happy coincidence.  The right of peaceful people to generally do as they please is more important than the impact on some vague notion of social utility.",1247083171

694478,comment,694425,694425,0,0,JimmyL,,,"I think it's one hell of an experiment, but in all honesty I don't wish you luck. When it comes to many things having to do with politics - and the clusterfuck that is California in the wake of their ballot initiative system is the prime example - people are dumb.<p>For lack of a better word, legislating is hard work. It's complex, it involves a lot of details about things that most people have no idea about, and it often involves putting the good of he few about the good of the individual. Congresspeople have an entire staff devoted to leaning about bills and telling their bosses how to vote - do we as individuals have enough time and knowledge to make a meaningful contribution?<p>You might also consider that if you're trying to represent the views of ""everyday Americans,"" they're not (in general) the kind of people who will spend a few hours honestly and impartially considering the pros and cons of a bill in Congress and then coming to a reasoned decision. The vast majority of the people you'd get participating would be either political geeks who would talk forever, or drop-in participants who are only there because the NRA/NARAL listed you in a partisan mail shot.<p>I also wonder how you would deal with the speed of Congress - while most things are scheduled, it's rare to have much lead-time when dealing with floor amendments or things coming out of Committee. You'd also - especially in the House - need a solid educational component to explain what's being voted on (why is a vote on a Rule important and what does it impact, etc.).<p>I think the system is somewhat broken, but I don't think this is the way to fix it. Direct democracy works in very few places - Switzerland is the closest to the ideal you're presenting, I think - and those have very long participatory democratic traditions, and a high level of civic involvement. For the most part, it ends up with places having a huge number of specific budgetary requirements that are good in individuality, but when taken together hamstring the place from working (and make it issue IOUs).<p>Lastly, the minute you start dealing with any money, talk to a lawyer who does FEC stuff. Campaign finance is complex, and you (being pretty much anyone who doesn't specialize in it)  almost certainly don't understand it well enough.<p>Like I said, I don't wish your idea luck, but I hope it doesn't fail for simple regulatory reasons.",1247080908

Yet in our society, where efficiency must often be balanced against safety, risk cannot be fully eliminated.<p>Council workers would surely be safer if the roads they repaired were closed for the duration, but we cannot stomach the roads being fully closed. Furniture movers would certainly suffer less chance of back injury if there were four men lifting that dresser instead of two, yet no-one would hire them if their prices doubled. And the aluminium smelter might well be able to significantly reduce its injury rate by investing billions in a new process, but the product would no longer be viable and the factory would close, simply moving the risk to a less caring jurisdiction.<p>One can continue like this all day.

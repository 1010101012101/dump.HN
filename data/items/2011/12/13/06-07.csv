APIs are the problem, they are displacing portions of the web which were far more reusable. They require custom clients (usually in js) per site, and the authors who aren't responsible enough to do progressive enhancement are the same ones who aren't capable of (or even interested in) maintaining a documented, stable, backward-compatible API for years.

3346705,comment,3346423,3346423,2,0,Mz,,,"<i>It comes across very arrogant to me, including this statement ""VC funded yadayada"".</i><p>Given that other people here are saying that only YC funded companies can post a job ad here, maybe it's a ""yeah, you knew that already, let's not waste any more time on that stuff"" type sentiment.  Of course, there are other people saying they didn't know that, so perhaps the main sin they are committing is assuming that the audience is as ""in the know"" as they are -- ie they are assuming everyone on HN is as aware as they are of how all this ties back to YC, only that's not an accurate assumption.<p>It's often really tough to figure out how to make sure you are including enough information to inform your audience without including so much as to insult their intelligence.  This becomes more complicated as audience size and diversity grows and HN is quite heavily trafficked these days.  Perhaps it is better for this company to write the ad so as to not insult the intelligence of the more in-the-know types who realize the ads here are only from YC funded companies than to over-explain.  It may be better to offend and alienate the relatively ""clueless"" than to insult the intelligence of the types of people they hope will actually apply.  I mean if someone not in the know concludes they are arrogant pricks and ""I wouldn't want to work there"", hey, probably no loss.  It might even be saving them wasted time (by reducing the number of applications from clueless people).  But talking to the highly qualified like they are uninformed 5 year olds who need everything explained, well, there goes your best potential candidates.  Good luck filling it now.",1323759500

You learn to build things by building things, and you build things by following recipes, recipes that are very slightly above your skill level, but no more. Go get some recipes, and use the techniques they tell you to use, and build some pancakes, and eat them. [1] Then you will ""know the feeling of what it is like to create something."" Something <i>tasty</i>.<p>I can hear you already: ""My pancakes are just pancakes! They are not <i>amazing and original</i> pancakes."" This is true. You need to get over that. Trying to amaze yourself is generally a waste of time. You can't do it consistently that's what ""amazing"" means: something that doesn't happen every day. If what you want to do is create things, lots of things, every day, you've got to realize that it's not going to feel amazing while you're doing it. It's going to feel normal.<p>But: It will be tasty. Oh, there are worse fates than being so good at making pancakes that you can make them without even thinking. For one thing, <i>other</i> people will eventually start talking about your amazing pancakes, and even though you'll know in your heart that they're flattering you - hey, they're just the same pancakes that you've made a hundred times, from a recipe, with only a minor tweak or two - it will still be gratifying.<p>And <i>maybe</i> in thirty years you'll be the next Anthony Bourdain, and you'll be out drinking one night and suddenly you'll look at yourself and your own life and be amazed: You remember starting off with the pancakes, and you just kept trying a little more every day, and then there was the day you got a job <i>cranking</i> out those pancakes on the line, and man was <i>that</i> an educational experience, but now it's years later and you're <i>shocked</i> to find that you're some kind of <i>breakfast legend</i>, people <i>line up</i> for your amazing cooking, and at that moment you'll actually be amazed at yourself for everything you have accomplished. You'll be amazed for at least five minutes, maybe even ten minutes, depending on how much you've been drinking. [2]<p>Then you'll wake up the next morning and go back to work, just like we all do.<p>Anyway, programming. Throw SICP away and try something like Zed Shaw's <i>Learn Python the Hard Way</i>, something with a lot of exercises. Do all the exercises. Then do some of those programming-contest-type problems. Do <i>little</i> problems, ten-minute problems, thirty-minute problems. Practice the art of small victories.<p>---<p>[1] No, do not use a pancake mix. That's like copy-and-paste.<p>[2] Incidentally, alcohol is a depressant, so don't think I'm seriously recommending it to someone who is already depressed. Coffee! I meant coffee!",1323759156

3346675,comment,3346242,3346242,7,0,ebiester,,,"First, there is nothing to be ashamed about for being an enterprise programmer. So, you've been working as an assembler. Now is the time to look at the tools themselves.<p>First, go back and review the basics of web programming. <a href=""https://code.google.com/edu/submissions/html-css-javascript/#introduction"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/edu/submissions/html-css-javascript/...</a> is a good start. It is probably below your level, but do it anyway. Get some confidence. :) Do the same with a decent book on your programming language. Get an understanding from the ground up. Make sure you can program 100 lines without looking anywhere.<p>Next, start learning your tools. Were you using jQuery? Oracle? Start delving into what those tools really are. Watch screencasts and follow along, typing the exact code in as you go. Make a basic to-do application in the technologies that are on your resume. Don't be afraid to look on the internet, but there's one rule.<p>No copy and paste.<p>No, every time you find an answer, you're going to type it in directly. Every line you type in, you're going to think about what each thing means, and if you don't know, you look it up in the documentation.<p>Learn how to write a login page, how to connect to a random single signon. How to logoff. How to write each piece of the app. You will soon have a simple application. It's not much, but it's yours. Write unit tests and integration tests. If you think code looks messy, clean it up. This is your template.<p>Now, add some ajax. See how others are doing it, but again type it in yourself. Put in all the features you want to learn. Keep updating the tests, both front end and back end.<p>Now, try implementing the front end in backbone and jQuery, or whatever front end technology you want to try first. Keep the back end the way it is, and keep the look of the front end how it is. Just port the code over.<p>Now choose a back end you're interested in. Port the back end. You know how to make the simple case already, it's just a matter of learning how the new one works. THEN you take your todo app and start making things from that, now that you know how everything works basically.<p>Now, for interviews, take a month off and do all this. (Block reddit and use aggressive noprocrast on HN.) Then go back and interview for mid level positions. Many coders you are competing against are in the same position as you are, but you've gone back and taken the time to really learn your set of tools.<p>I really believe the difference between a bad and mediocre web programmer, in many cases, is about 100 hours of dedicated training about how the web works, and how their programming language works. The difference between a mediocre and a B- programmer is being able to rattle off the basics really quickly and knowing their toolset.<p>Getting to the A level, that takes more time. But you can do that as you have a job. :)",1323758693

That's why I'm thinking of living in Oakland or Berkeley, and working in SF.<p>A ""nicer home""... in Oakland or Berkeley, that's the hills. Expect about $1MM or so: <a href=""http://www.redfin.com/CA/Berkeley/938-Spruce-St-94707/home/1435762"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.redfin.com/CA/Berkeley/938-Spruce-St-94707/home/1...</a><p>I hear you can get a fixer in Oakland's hills for around $500k though, an old coworker did that. You might consider going further east to Pleasant Hill or Concord -- PH if safety/schools are a concern (more $), Concord if you can deal with the hoodrats and older homes (less $). Both are fairly inexpensive in comparison to anything closer to the City, and both are on the BART line... ~45 min on the train to SF.<p>Don't count out south SF too, for example a pretty nice place in Daly City for $600k: <a href=""http://www.redfin.com/CA/Daly-City/392-Bay-Ridge-Dr-94014/home/2054710"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.redfin.com/CA/Daly-City/392-Bay-Ridge-Dr-94014/ho...</a><p>Personally I've found that commuting drains a lot of the get-er'-done energy from me. If I had the dough, I'd live closer to the City or the valley. YMMV. San Jose has lots of nice areas, but it's an urban wasteland... block after unending block of houses and strip malls in many areas. The nicer areas are $$$$$.<p>When I was working at a startup fresh out of college, I got a 400 sqft studio in the middle of the city, which was perfect. It was an ungodly $1k/month, but I walked nearly everywhere and spent all day coworking or at a cafe anywhere. If you're unattached, I'd highly recommend a setup like that, since proximity to the things you need (people like you, cafes, etc) is more important than living quarters.

There were a couple times in my life where I completely walked away because I wasn't sure that it was actually what I wanted to do.  The first time was in high school.  For three years I barely even used a computer.  I took a course in Pascal but once I got my assignment done I was doing other things.  Before high school I was pretty much glued to my computer 24/7 hacking this game or that.<p>The second time was a year into university.  My freshman year I was on my computer hacking all the time.  Learning new web tech etc.  After my freshman year I pretty much got sick of everything computer related and even ended up not going to class and the next year dropping out completely.<p>The time away allowed me to explore new ideas and other worlds that I never did when I was glued to my computer all the time.  Learning computer tech is not an easy thing, and it takes A LOT of time and dedication.  Some people may make it look easy, but I think those people are in the minority.<p>After taking a year off I realized that I really missed working and creating stuff computer related.  It gave me a lot of motivation to go back to university and start learning stuff again.  Suddenly university was actually easy, who would have though listening in class and taking notes gets one 75% of the way there.<p>Leaving computers behind for a while was the best thing I ever did.  I look back fondly at all the experiences I gained during those times.<p>If you find that there is a hole that programming will fill, you will know it.  Picking it up again is easy.  Its like learning to ride a bike, you may get a little sloppy but it comes back relatively fast.<p>Oh and stop visiting HN. It is good at depressing people.  Realize that HN is like the rest of the news out there, it focuses mainly on the success stories.  Not many people write articles about projects they never ended up finishing.  Trust me everyone does it.  I have around 20 half done projects.  HN gets me depressed as well, and I think i'm a pretty competent programmer and had a chance to work on some awesome projects.<p>Your not alone...  don't let the successes on HN get you down.  Learn to program because you yourself get off on it, not because you care what anyone else is doing...",1323756760

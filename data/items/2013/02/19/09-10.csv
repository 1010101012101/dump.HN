5243509,comment,5241426,5243372,1,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"I mostly agree with you, but I think their will be some confusion until we work this out. I'm not sure what Bret Victors refers to his work, but I found the similarities between his work and Chris's thesis to be very striking even though I'm sure they are independent. Perhaps we can harmonize or at least figure out what the key messages are to avoid confusion.<p>I think you want to provide feedback for each discrete or continuous action by the user. This is quite easy if we are relying on structured editing, but much harder for free form text. My current policy is to re-execute memoization units after each keystroke, though certain syntax and type errors can prevent the executed expression tree from changing (but then the feedback is a syntax/type error!). Getting live feedback also requires toleration to transient syntax/semantic/and execution errors, and to be fairly efficient. In this case, we should tolerate and react to '1' and '10', even if they lead to a program in a weird state (e.g., x - N, where N should be > 100), but you still want to show some kind of change. And this is where live programming is very different: the steady frame that we are viewing while editing should always CHANGE when we edit, meaning it should be focused on some execution result of the code being editing. Doing something without immediate feedback is being a sad panda.",1361267783

It had probes attached to every point in the circuit where I suspected I could see something and learn about the source of the problem.  I also tested for thermal issues with heat guns and freeze sprays, familiar troubleshooting techniques to anyone who's done this kind of thing.<p>Anyhow, every so often the thing would go nuts.  The three scopes I had connected to it showed things I simply didn't understand.  I'd analyze but couldn't make any sense out of it.  Still, again, every so many days it would happen again.  Changed power supplies and the usual suspects.  No difference.<p>Well, finally, two weeks later, the other engineers in the office took pity on me and told me what was going on:  They had connected a VARIAC to the power strip I was using to power the UUT (unit under test).  The scopes and other test instruments remained on clean power.  Every so often they'd reach into this drawer where the VARIAC was hidden and lower my power strip's voltage just enough for the power supplies to fall out of regulation and everything start beeping and sputtering.  Those friggin SOB's.  They had me going for days!  I was pissed beyond recognition.  Of course, after a while I was laughing my ass off alongside them.  Good joke.  Cruel, but good.<p>My revenge:  A CO2 fire extinguisher rigged to go off into his crotch when my buddy sat down to work.<p>Fun place to work.  We did this kind of stuff all the time.  Today I'd be afraid of getting sued.  People have really thin skins these days.",1361264505

Gun control discussions, nuclear power plant safety, anti-terrorism measures... it's a long list. Suddenly, governments and societies want action and funding there, where before no need was seen, when the actual situation didn't change.<p>(However, in the case of climate change, it might be just to late to steer things properly when the effects become clear.)",1361264435

We are all concerned with liveness, and your debugging is my (and I think Bret Victors) exploratory programming.<p>I can understand your frustrations, lets talk by email about establishing a clearer distinction between performance and more general contexts, if you don't mind. But I think not on the basis that they are completely unrelated, to me it makes sense to think of live coding in social situations (including lectures, dojos,conference talks as well as a/v performances and group music making) is an application for live programming languages.<p>I can agree reinterpretation per key press is useful in some very particular circumstances, but not others. The difference is not in delay, but in what constitutes an edit.",1361264419

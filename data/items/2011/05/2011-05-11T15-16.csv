It's apple's proprietary tightly controlled market. You want to make money? Bend over backwards for them. Otherwise piss off.

MS has been pretty nice over the years with what they allow. However if MS says ""30% surcharge on any application selling something running on windows"" then guess what, same cries will happen.

That's why I buy my groceries online and my local store delivers them the next day. I spend five minutes to do it and someone else goes to the store and brings it to my kitchen, so I can avoid the driving, the parking, the lines, the kids, the checkouts, the bringing the groceries in. Same for as many other things as I can buy online instead of in person. Including (as much as possible) clothes.<p>See, I'm a male. I don't particularly care if I'm wearing the latest fashion or if I've adopted the Bieber haircut. It doesn't matter to me. I buy clothing that doesn't have logos or advertise anything on it. I like black clothing. I also don't like to waste time with hairstyles. I shave my head and have for over a decade. It saves me time and looks fine. Just like pants or slacks and a black shirt looks fine. Because, again, I don't build my entire life and self-esteem around what I look like.<p>As long as I look like I showered and didn't sleep in a gutter overnight, I'm fine. And, believe it or not, I've never had a woman give a damn about my shoes or the label on my clothing or whether my hair was feathered. They always want to know what I do for a living and what kind of car I drive and whether I own my own home and what part of town I live in and what school I went to  and (in roundabout ways of asking) how much money I make. None have ever given a god damn about my clothing. And if they have, I didn't know about it and didn't care.

Be forewarned, my information is largely relative to Wisconsin. Other regions of the US may use the words differently.<p>If applied to a person: trash usually refers to someone that's disreputable in some grievous way, waste would refer to some that squandered some talent or resources. Junk wouldn't usually apply to a person but junkie means a drug addict. Applying refuse to a person would be silly, but probably be .<p>If applied to stuff that's thrown out: Trash is a generic term for anything that's thrown away. Waste is usually consider excess like banana peels. (waste and trash are largely interchangeable in conversation, the distinction isn't usually important) Junk would refer to material possessions that are no longer wanted like an old couch. No one would call banana peels junk. Refuse is a pretentious/higher class term for trash used by rich old ladies.<p>I don't believe refuse is in the common usage any more. I've never heard it used outside of Star Trek 6 and some older movies. It's meaning is similar to ""trash"" but it can also refer a place where trash is stored.<p>Most of english is this way. Words are extremely flexible and can be used in a variety of ways with many meanings. Context is extremely important. I'm not sure how other languages work, I only speak english.",1305129201

It was a nightmare. If you can get in home care, that might, might help. But you would still be better off in a separate building. If you have a cottage, unattached garage, barn, etc, that might help. For me, I had to wait until my wife got home and go to a coffee shop. Then it took 45 minutes for my brain to spin down from its hypervigilant state. I developed tinnitus during those months, and still have it five years later.<p>The central problem is that you can't load big problems into your head.

I read somewhere that Napoleon was welcomed as a conquerer into parts of Italy because his government was a lot better than the local government. The problem with governments, though, is that they are fairly easy to establish, but, because they claim a monopoly on coercion, they are hard to replace when a better alternative appears.<p>For example, all of a city's private garbage collectors may do a poor job, so a very capable mayor may convince residents to allow the city to do the collecting. Years later, when situation is reversed and the city is doing a poor job in comparison with private collectors, it will be a lot harder to replace the government collectors with private ones. The correct response to poor private-sector service is not to bring in the government, but to bring in more private competition.",1305129164

Instead of running a/b testing, they can begin to see outliers and future trends.  They can learn consumer behavior by responding to back channel offers from consumers and then roll out appropriately with sales according to offers received.  The nice thing is the control instead of turning over your inventory to a third party liquidation specialist that is going to make a margin on all the down channel overstock.  It allows all vendors to have a certain outlet/flash possibility and increases engagement and page views.  This isn't a site though, it's a button or meebo like bar that you can send data back when you're on the product page to the vendor letting them know you'll buy at $x price.  The key would be the right amount of engagement and feedback from the vendor.

Also, there is a difference between wanting equity for control or equity for getting a share of the profits.<p>With 2 people: I think either you have a 50/50 split or you might as well have 99/1 or even 100/0. Anything more than 50/50 means one person has effectively total control. Thus, why pretend it's anything other than a dictatorship in that instance? If you both want control, you need 50/50.<p>If it is about making money, then in place of an equity stake, you can have a revenue sharing agreement that would provide a % of revenue or profits or even a % of whatever the company would get bought out for. The amount each person gets in that instance could vary a lot more based on contribution or whatever ""fairness factors"" made the most sense to both parties.<p>The point is, control and profit sharing are two separate issues that often get lumped into the equity discussion when they don't have to.<p>With 3+ people, I think the same rules tend to apply. I think for sake of simplicity it makes the most sense for smaller (non-VC backed companies) to split equity evenly among the founders or have a single person who has 100% control. Then, do revenue/profit sharing amongst everyone as is deemed ""fair"".<p>If you are VC backed, well that's a different ballgame all together.",1305128428

Would I trust a driverless car with current technology to navigate a busy parking lot? Not a chance. Would I trust it with the 40 mile commute I had, 38 miles of which were 6 lane highway? Probably. Would I trust it to make that same commute at times of low traffic when I'm likely tired myself? Absolutely. Not all driving needs a human's full attention, and the situations where a human doesn't need to pay full attention can be handled better by a computer which is immune to many of the distractions and weaknesses of the human mind. It's all situational and difficult to figure out, but the proper response is to keep plugging away at the parts of the problem you can gain some traction on and take what you can get.<p>There are cases like the busy parking lot where human control will likely be necessary well into the future, there are cases which can be addressed today, and there are cases which were addressed successfully over 20 years ago. Look up Ernst Dickmanns - he was an early pioneer in this field, and had an autonomous vehicle driving on European highways in traffic in the 80's. It's really easy to say that this is an impossible problem to tackle, but the person who says something can't be done should make damn sure he's not getting in the way of the person doing it.<p>I did my M.S. on this topic, so although I would not claim to be an expert in the field at Google's level, I do believe strongly in the technology and have given it more than cursory thought.

It sets the tone for the rest of the ""adventure"". ""We're in this together, whatever happens!"" is the core message.<p>This is important when the relationship between the founders is, in a way, irrational, based on unconditional friendship, and that relationship is being transferred into the business context.<p>The purpose of an unequal split is to fairly (!) represent the different contributions to the business. ""I'm bringing in all those things, and you're bringing in these things, and so I deserve 70% of the business and you deserve 30%."" It also sets the tone for the future.

My native language is General American English, and I grew up in what was essentially a monolingual immediate family and neighborhood of English speakers, although both of my parents had had some instruction in other languages. All of my grandparents were born in the United States, but three of the four spoke languages other than English at home, and my two maternal grandparents had all of their schooling in German.<p>German as a second language was mandatory for all elementary pupils in fourth, fifth, and sixth grade in my childhood school district, very unusual for the United States. I had more German in junior high and senior high (in two different states) and then Russian in senior high. I entered university as a Russian major and immediately began taking Chinese, switching my major to Chinese as I grew in delight for that language. I have had formal instruction as an adult in Modern Standard Chinese (a.k.a. Mandarin), Cantonese, Biblical Hebrew, Literary Chinese, Attic Greek, Biblical Hebrew, Japanese (first in the medium of Chinese, then in English), Taiwanese, and Hakka, and various courses in linguistics (also in the mediums of both English and Chinese). I have engaged in self-study of Biblical Aramaic, Mongolian, Spanish, French, Latin, Hungarian, Malay-Indonesian, Esperanto, Interlingua, etc., etc., etc.<p>I have to respectfully disagree with the strong version of the linguistic relativity hypothesis. Within each language grouping, people differ far more in their personal thinking along the dimension of visual thinker or not, or auditory thinker or not, than people differ from one another in thought patterns based on language background. But it is useful to learn another language and to live in another culture for exposure to new basic assumptions, and the same applies to learning computer language paradigms.

2536740,comment,2533406,2535215,1,0,pemulis,,,"I don't think that that extra security is what we're seeing priced in the exchange, though. The traditional causes of volatility in commodities like gold and silver are increases in supply (new mines being discovered, new techniques developed, etc.) and people hedging en masse as they lose faith in the value of fiat currencies. (There are also speculative bubbles on occasion, as with anything else.)<p>With bitcoins, we know where the supply will peak (21 million bitcoins) and the rate the supply will grow. Since the supply is predictable, it shouldn't lead to the volatility we can see in the market. The other cause for rapid deflation in commodities - people hedging because of a weak dollar (or whatever currency) - doesn't seem to be in play right now, either.<p>The increase in security might account for an increase in value, but not 50%+ in one day. That sort of rapid deflation tells you that this is a bubble. We don't know what the stable value of a bitcoin is right now. It may be $100, it may be $1. But since nearly everyone using bitcoins right now are using them as investment instruments, we aren't seeing anything like a real price. Merchant and consumer adoption don't matter right now. All that matters is the market of other speculators. Watching the way the price shot up and down and up and down over the past 24 hours makes me think that a few people are manipulating the market and making a killing, and a lot of other people are getting scammed.",1305126925

Often times, regulation is put in place to address some high-profile case, but ignores the consequences of the regulation.<p>Currently, infants less than two years of age can fly in an airplane without a separate ticket.  Years ago, after some instances where such children were injured/killed in accidents, there was talk of forcing parents to buy separate tickets for infants and require them to use an approved child seat.  However, had this regulation gone into effect, the extra cost of flying would have forced many families to drive instead of fly, resulting in a greater amount of injuries/deaths.",1305126913

Nursery is not some kind of punishment for your kids, in fact it's probably the opposite, especially if the alternative is being looked after by a stressed mum who's trying to do two incredibly taxing jobs at the same time!<p>From your post it sounds like the issue is your nursery, if you're not happy with it try looking around for a different one didn't. Speak to friends & acquaintances, do the legwork and visit some in the day and find one your comfortable with. I've seen quite a few people give up on nursery because the first one they tried didn't fit, don't let an implementation put you off the whole concept.<p>Working from home is hard with kids, I do it 2 days a week and I find it challenging to concentrate even though I'm not looking after them (headphones are your friend!) May be worth talking to your present employer and seeing if you can reduce your hours or become more flexible, say go down to 3 days a week with 1 work from home. In that situation your probably not going to make that day up while your kid is awake, but spreading a couple of hours a day in the evening or while your partner plays mom across the remaining days is doable.<p>Your kids most pressing need is some happy supportive parents (or parent) so don't beat yourself up about your decisions if your kids are smiling and happy. Parenting is a minefield these days, mostly because the natural parent emotions (panic, worry, paranoia) have been turned into multi-billion dollar industries.

While we're a litigation-happy society, we are also entirely content with letting government and business trample all over us without raising an eyebrow, much less a finger.<p>We let companies get away with destroying the economy through sloppy and greedy irresponsible behavior and then we cover their asses by bailing them out. Because the committees that determine their bailing out are filled with former/current executives of the same companies they're bailing out (Goldman Sachs, for example).<p>We let companies stick dangerous and unproven chemicals in our food, soda, animals with little evidence that it's safe beforehand and little oversight afterhand, because the various government agencies (FDA, for example) are staffed primarily with executives of the companies that are trying to ram these things through (aspartame, roundup-ready seeds, rbgh in milk, etc).<p>We have food that is mass produced in conditions that are horrifying to anyone who, even if they love meat like I do, don't like to see living creatures abused and tortured in the process and that are filthy and commonly spread disease (that we see reports of all the time on the news when there are outbreaks and recalls), because the FDA and other agencies are - again - staffed with current/former executives of the biggest food manufacturers and processors in the world.<p>Hell, we even have government officials shutting down public run juvenile rehabilitation centers so that private ones can take their places and then those private companies paying judges directly to incentive's them to send juveniles to jail. I forget where this was (the northeast is what I remember), but a couple years ago it was huge news and it actually happened. The judge in question (and there may have been more than one) received millions of dollars in payola from the private prison industry system that built the juvenile detention centers. As a result, the judge just kept sending kids there. First time offenders. Kids who did very little to deserve it (get in a fight at school, use foul language, skip school) would get about two minutes of face time with the judge before he sentenced them to the facility. And once at the facility, they would keep kids indefinitely, until <i>they</i> said it was time to go. So a two week sentence could turn into a year.

Our youngest just turned 2.<p>Basically I came to the point, about 6 months ago, where I can no longer do any useful work (before bedtime c.8pm) and look after the little one. He does have a nap for up to an hour a day and that's the most time I can hope to gain. But then he's also up at 6am and I'm a night owl so I often need a little nap myself. He can of course play independently in the house or mess around in the garden but I find context switching to be extremely hard. Whenever I try to use the phone he's there or hes calling me or fallen over or something.<p>After our first child when I first started professional web design work I'd simply work in to the night. It's possible to do the actual work but what I couldn't do was go out and find new work easily.<p>We started our own business(es) and took a huge cut in our income, then had kids ... I wanted kids. I want to raise them and spend time with them, as much as possible really.<p>In short raising my own kids is mostly joyful and rewarding; I don't really understand having children and then getting someone else to raise them for you. If you have a ready source of [PHP] work then I think it's eminently doable, if you have to seek for work, win clients, etc., then I think it's going to get very much harder.<p>/rambling",1305126034

8272244,comment,8270771,8271198,1,0,possibilistic,,,"Except we are <i>computer scientists</i> and there is no BNF grammar (or what have you) for the language. We all know we can do better than that. I&#x27;m just shocked this omission went for so long without anyone noticing--it&#x27;s a big freaking deal.<p>Formalization of a grammar isn&#x27;t &quot;design by committee&quot; (and in any case, this work in particular certainly was not). Formalization sets a logical, mathematical foundation for something that has thus far been a rather back-of-the-napkin, cowboy coded, cargo cult kind of thing. Could you name all the terminals before? I couldn&#x27;t.<p>Markdown is implemented in hundreds of places (conservative guess). Discounting marked deviations and well-known dialects, it is a nontrivial task to ascertain whether a given Markdown implementation will produce the &quot;correct output&quot;. What is correct output? Our ability to express or ascertain that is complicated by the fact that some rather archaic perl code [1] somehow holds the dubious distinction of being the de facto standard reference point for Markdown. Perhaps it was chosen as such on account of being the first mover, but probably its because nobody else had spoken up yet. (We&#x27;re playing catch up now.)<p>&quot;Implementation defines the standard&quot; is a poor substitute for formality and is the result of intellectual laziness. (Hello PHP prior to HHVM.)<p>How did any of us effectively communicate what we thought correct meant? I feel a lot of our consensus was arrived at by enumerating all the examples and complex edge cases we could think of. (There&#x27;s an idea that&#x27;ll cover <i>all</i> the bases, yet it still maintains the niceties of being wonderfully concise!)<p>A formal grammar, as it turns out, is rather usually concise by nature (at least for the types of languages we care to design). To the attentive and deliberate thinker, a grammar&#x27;s rules can be beautiful. A random mental walk through a complex repeating parse tree fills the mind all at once with intracate patterns and possibility. These are structures you can truly <i>grok</i>. With just pen and paper, or a standard text editor, you can easily define how the edges and vertices of an arbitrarily complex, infinite graph can connect. It&#x27;s really kind of special, and definitely cerebral.<p>So now that we have a Markdown grammar to look to, libraries now have an easy model for attaining consensus agreement. \nNobody is going to force anyone to change their current implementation or preference. If you like the one you&#x27;ve got, that&#x27;s perfectly valid state to be in. If your only objection to the new formalization is because it was named the so-called &quot;standard grammar,&quot; it&#x27;s just a name. A silly old case of primate chest pounding, at that. Great ape problems.<p>Despite all the drama, this spec will probably not be the final end-all, be-all of 80 character wide expression. I can picture infinitely many such grammars, each one being just a little more absurdly named than its predecessor. Nothing is stopping you from forking &quot;standard markdown&quot; and calling it <i>MarkyMark</i> or something.<p>I still can&#x27;t believe none of us ever noticed there wasn&#x27;t a grammar for this. Especially given we communicated all of it through bloated Perl code shared from a zip file.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/rtomayko/shocco/blob/master/Markdown.pl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rtomayko/shocco/blob/master/Markdown.pl</a><p>(Sorry for the non-canonical link; I&#x27;m on my phone.

Further, the first article I found on a 2 minute google search, mentions a large fund that was speaking out against HFT in 2009.  This is as simple of proof as I can provide that your position that HFT is not opposed by large finance groups as untrue.<p>&quot;Frankly I don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;re still defending barclays for selling an service promising freedom from HFT &quot;<p>Not once in this whole thread have I defended Barclay&#x27;s and trying to paint me with that brush is either a sign of extreme obtuseness or terrible rhetoric.  What I argue is that the reason Barclay&#x27;s needed to defraud their customers is that their claim (and all other dark pool&#x27;s) claim that they could provide a better trading environment by excluding HFTs has been historically proven as false.  Traders are not dumb, they move to the venues that provide them with the best trading environment and that has continued to be venues that allow market makers EVEN IN THE FACE OF FRAUD.<p>No matter how many times you paint HFT as &quot;predators&quot; or &quot;sharks&quot; or as &quot;spearing whales&quot; you&#x27;ve yet to describe a single behavior attributed to HFTs that is in any way unethical or illegal.<p>[edit: having to work around HN reply rules, I apologize]\nTo the reply below about BlackRock.

That means that the taxpayers of Nevada, collectively, have $1.25B less while Tesla has $1.25B more.  Now Tesla may spend every dollar of that money in the state of Nevada, hiring people, buying supplies, making investments, etc.  But for every dollar being spent by Tesla, that&#x27;s one fewer dollar being spent by a Nevada taxpayer into the same economy.  Those dollars that would have been spent hiring people, buying supplies, making investments, and so on from Nevada taxpayers are now not being spent on those things.<p>So you can count up all the &quot;stimulus&quot; from the money that goes to Tesla over the next decade, but you&#x27;re ignoring the money that now isn&#x27;t getting spent and the jobs that now aren&#x27;t getting created.<p>Actually, it&#x27;s worse than just redistribution, for two reasons:<p>1) It&#x27;s likely that a lot of the money will not be spent in Nevada, and I doubt anyone is auditing this deal for the next decade to make sure that it is.<p>2) Before, those dollars were being spent privately by millions of taxpayers who got to decide if the money they spent for X product or Y employee was worth it, and could take individualized risks with their own dollars.  But now that their money has been pooled and dumped into Tesla, those taxpayers of Nevada have taken on a substantial risk with no equivalent reward.  If Tesla is explosively successful, they don&#x27;t see any more money than if Tesla just limps along for a couple decades.  But if Tesla fails, they&#x27;ve lost it all with nothing to show for it (save for the few people who got a job out of the deal...but there aren&#x27;t enough jobs at Tesla to compensate every taxpayer in Nevada for the risk).<p>In short, it&#x27;s difficult to see this deal as anything more than a great benefit to a few people (Tesla investors, Tesla employees, Tesla consumers) at the expense of the taxpayers of Nevada.",1409887030

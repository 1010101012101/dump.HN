6409335,comment,6400455,6402075,1,0,chacham15,,,"> Since phase 2 prices vary at most 10x and the big successes generate returns of at least 100x, investors should pick startups entirely based on their estimate of the probability that the company will be a big success and hardly at all on price.<p>To give concrete numbers to pgs statement:<p>Pick 2 hypothetical startups: A and B. A will go on to be a 10 billion dollar company and B will be a 100 million dollar company. Now, valuations at round B series vary from say $40 million to $400 million (as pg said 10x). Note: they arent yet worth what they will be worth later. Now, say you take a 20% equity cut for the round and there is no dilution between this and when they go public (just a simplifying assumption). At the end, the 20% equity is worth either 200 million dollars for A or 20 million for B. The difference in profit is 180 million dollars; much more than any additional amount you would have paid to get in on a higher valuation. Therefore, if you believe the company to be of the A type, you will pay that 20% of a higher valuation.<p>> pay whatever the price happens to be.<p>This is what pg means: the difference in profit between A and B was 180 million dollars which far exceeds the difference in cost in investing in the two. This makes the investors rather price insensitive IF they think that you are in the A category. The reason that investors have the mental model of assigning to categories rather than guessing the percent chance of success is that they know often they guess wrong. There are simply too many variables to create any sort of accurate chance of success.",1379555893

Unaware there are worse options: Productivity: 9.<p>* College, year 1: dorm with roommate, cop-style desks facing each other. Shut up! Productivity: 4.<p>* College, years 2-4: two roommates, desk under bed. Vaguely cramped, but not bad. Productivity: 6.<p>* First ship: Flight of the Intruder style aluminum desk/dresser/bookcase measuring 24&quot; wide, aligned athwartships, so every roll of that frigate dumped my work all over until I hacked some retaining straps in. (<a href=""http://www.maritime.org/tour/img/fbc/fbc-captain.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maritime.org/tour/img/fbc/fbc-captain.jpg</a>, except our bunks were 3 high). Productivity: 3.<p>* Second ship: Double-wide version of same but it&#x27;s a carrier, no rolling. Productivity: NA because I also an actual office, with a door, and it was right next to wardroom. Downside: back wall of office was next to the trap wires. Had to wear double hearing protection during flight ops. Office productivity: 6-9.<p>* Staff at the Naval Academy, Annapolis: more desk acreage than I could use, huge vaulted window, rich blue carpet, could hide out all day. Productivity: 0-8. Home office: got an Ethan Allen desk on clearance. Productivity: 6.<p>* Med school, year 1: Katrina. 5&#x27; folding table next to the foldout couch two very kind University of Houston students let me sleep on all year. Still have that folding table. Not bad. Productivity: 6-8.<p>* Med school, years 2-4, New Orleans: Ethan Allen desk tried in every room of the house, but little kids make it impossible. Productivity at home: 0. Starbucks: 7.<p>* Internship. Same as above, but also had a cubicle in the 180 desk &quot;resident storage facility&quot;. Had no desire to be there and rare could be. Productivity at cubicle: -1.<p>* First job as a doc: moved to San Diego, converted falling-apart cubicle desk in our office (incidentally the server closet, possibly the only reason it had an air conditioner) into a standing desk. Joy. Could work all day. Had a 34&quot; stool that helped on occasion. 3 officemates: productivity: 5. A Navy clinic, &quot;doctor&#x27;s office&quot; set up during the weekdays I took clinic, productivity: 4 (they seemed to feel doctors were cheaper than medical assistants). Starbucks: 7.<p>* Oh, during that job, worked at an urgent care on the weekends: sterile &quot;doctor&#x27;s office&quot; with a desk and computer. 4 exam rooms. Highly routinized workflow seeing 30+ patients in 12 hours. Productivity: 11.<p>* Currently: professionally designed cubicle set up in an office with one office mate. We face opposite directions, neither face away from the door. Most productive ever. Productivity: 8-9. Starbucks 7. But also moved my Ethan Allen desk into my bedroom and installed a door lock. Home productivity: 4-8.<p>N=1",1379555498

Let&#x27;s assume I use a license for my module source that is not compatible with GPLv2.<p>If you take my module, and compile it into a Linux kernel, and want to distribute the resulting binary, then YOU have a problem in that the resulting binary that includes the kernel and my module is probably a derivative work of the Linux kernel, and the license of the kernel doesn&#x27;t let you distribute derivative works of the kernel unless they are licensed under GPLv2. (You might try to argue that my module and the kernel together are a compilation, not a derivative work, but I don&#x27;t think that would work).<p>I&#x27;ve seen it argued that since my module is intended to be built into kernels and doesn&#x27;t have much use if not built into kernels, than I am effectively building it into kernels and distributing it even though others do the actual building, and so I do have to license my code under GPL.<p>Copyright law (at least in the US) does actually recognize a couple of circumstances under which I could be liable for someone else&#x27;s infringement. There is &quot;contributory infringement&quot; and &quot;induced infringement&quot;. If either of these could be applied, I could be held responsible for the infringement that occurs when others build infringing kernels using my module source. For induced infringement, the person actually doing the infringement basically has to be an agent of mine, so that would not apply. For contributory infringement, I just have to be doing something that enables their infringement.<p>Alas for those who want to hold me liable, there is a major problem with the contributory infringement approach. There CANNOT be contributory infringement without there being a direct infringement for me to have been contributory toward, and there must no substantial non-infringing use for my work. As even Stallman concedes, the GPL allows a person to take GPL source code and combine it with code that is licensed incompatibly with GPL and build binaries for their own private use. These people are not infringing, and so do not provide a foundation for contributory infringement, and they provide an example of a substantial non-infringing use for my work.<p>The above hypothetical (module distributed in source form only) is what I think of when I hear the phrase &quot;independently compiled&quot;.<p>One thing often overlooked when these discussions come up is that the Linux kernel is not the first program that outsiders have wanted to write code for without following the rules set forth by the program&#x27;s owners. People have been figuring out non-public internal interfaces and data structures of word processors, spreadsheets, video games, embedded systems, proprietary operating systems, and so on, and then releasing things that patch in and do unauthorized things long before Linux came along. All that&#x27;s different with Linux is that (1) they can look at the Linux code so it is a lot easier to figure out non-public internal interfaces and data structures, and (2) GPL saves them from contributory infringement (with unauthorized modifications to proprietary programs, the end user might be violating a EULA if they use your work, which puts you on less firm ground).",1379554943

All ambient noise is suppressed--I can&#x27;t hear the people in the next cube if they&#x27;re talking quietly.  Only the shrillest beeps or sneezes disrupt my concentration.<p>- Lots of natural light.  If you&#x27;re going to do open concept, at least take advantage of the #1 benefit.<p>- Lots of small meeting rooms with whiteboards.<p>Even then, I noticed a massive difference in how much I enjoyed the open plan when I transitioned from working on a project that was very collaborative (pairing being the norm) to a project that required a lot of solo effort.  I&#x27;m very conscious of distractions now, and end up working later hours to take advantage of the quiet when everyone&#x27;s gone home.<p>So I think there&#x27;s a lot to be said about the dynamic of your team.

Another place I worked at strongly respected headphones as the &quot;don&#x27;t bother me&quot; signal.\n- A reasonable number of walled-off rooms for anyone to use.  Need to take a phone call?  Have a quick 1-on-1?  Debate something loudly with 3-5 people?  You need to have rooms, of varying sizes, to handle these use cases near at hand.\n- Minimal noise that&#x27;s not related to collaboration.  Eg, no loud ringing phones.  No phone-based customer support department in the same room as the devs.  No kitchen (full of dishwashers, coffee grinders, etc) area facing the open workspace.<p>Open offices can work, but only if you go out of your way to make them work.

The air pressure being reduced in the tube is done more for efficiency than as the mechanism of movement.",1379552516

We don&#x27;t have to completely understand a highly complex system before we can make some fixes. Intervening before it breaks frees us from the work of repairing what we can&#x27;t manage. This resonated with me the first time I read about it.",1379552428

I think the evolutionary perspective is clearly &quot;correct,&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t quite answer the big questions for me. It establishes that &quot;death is bad&quot; is an axiom of our ethical system (and not a theorem of it,) but it has nothing to say when we ask whether we should attempt to adjust our morality.<p>1: <a href=""http://chronicle.com/article/Is-Death-Bad-for-You-/131818/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chronicle.com/article/Is-Death-Bad-for-You-/131818/</a>",1379552415

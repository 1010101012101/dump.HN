(source: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2778945"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2778945</a>).<p>I have to disagree with you here.  Graph DBs are a much more elegant way to store graph data, i.e. social media data, some forms of scientific data.   But for the vast majority of relational database usage, i.e. finance, accounting, retail, medical records, human resources, academia, reservation databases, etc. the truly vast amount of databases we interact with indirectly all day long, these systems are firmly in the relational camp and that is not changing anytime soon.  SQLAlchemy would very much like Python to be prevalent throughout all these industries, and is not just about social media applications.",1311173953

Easy enough, even at that scale.<p>The problem of course is that you're not getting 10k/s. Some seconds you may get 100k, others 1k.<p>So we built a simple system that automatically spawned S3 instances when we began to see high loads, distributed the latest code to them, and when we no longer needed them, we downloaded the DB they held locally and moved the data to HDFS.<p>What we did is pretty common, I'm sure.

If we were talking about Vulcans then, yes, the optimizations would always be implemented. My personal experience is mainly with technology companies and in that field, at least, the optimizations are more often not implemented, even if they will indeed save money in the long run. I think that these problems are reflected in the general population where only a fraction of people make investments and the vast majority tend to chase after quick profit rather than lasting wealth. Business has a higher percentage of the latter but there is still plenty of the former.<p>Edit: Also, we might be talking about slightly different situations, I'm mainly referring to optimizations which require a time investment up front, not 'free' ones.",1311173721

For 100 years (longer?), the education system hasn't really changed at all. The addition of computers has been more like 'faster horses' than 'cars'. Highschool/gradeschool teachers aren't really that effective at learning new things.

Technology should be leveraged and used to evolve so we can do things we couldn't before, not be an expensive drop in replacement.<p>If you have kids, ask them if their teachers forbid the use of wikipedia, or embrace it as an imperfect information source.

2785663,comment,2785239,2785239,10,0,espeed,,,"This article is by Armin Ronacher, the author of Flask. I use Flask for most of my projects because it's decoupled from the ORM and provides a clean way for you to use whatever database tool is right for the job.<p>But lately I have moved away from using the relational database as the primary datastore. When I do need a relational database, it's simple to use SQLAlchemy in Flask.<p>But I have been finding graph databases as a more elegant alternative to relational databases because you don't have to mess with tables or joins -- everything is explicitly joined.<p>Neo4j is one of the leading open-source graph databases, and it's pretty sweet -- it can store 32 billion nodes while doing 2 million traversals per second -- and you can use Gremlin with it (Gremlin is a graph query language, like SQL for graphs).<p>The graph-database world is starting to emerge, but most graph databases are Java based so non-JVM bindings are not always available.<p>However, there is a project called TinkerPop (<a href=""http://www.tinkerpop.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tinkerpop.com</a>) that has made most of the open-source software stack for graph DBs. TinkerPop is the project that developed Gremlin and Blueprints, and it released a REST service called Rexster that is tied to Blueprints so it lets you connect to any Blueprints-enabled graph database, including Neo4j, OrientDB, Dex, OpenRDF, and an InfiniteGraph implementation is being released next month.<p>Because the graph-DB world lacked Python support, I decided to write a Python persistence framework that connects to Rexster so you can now use any of those graph DBs from Python, and binary bindings are in the works. The framework is called Bulbflow, and you can find out more about it out at <a href=""http://bulbflow.com/overview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bulbflow.com/overview</a>.<p>In a few weeks I'm going to release Flask-based libraries that do authentication and authorization in a graph-DB way.",1311171971

You'll probably never get to entirely stop thinking about race conditions, but they're much easier to deal with in Erlang, for instance, where there's only a very limited number of ways to create a race condition, as opposed to how there's only a very limited number of ways to <i>fail</i> to create a race condition in imperative-mutable threaded programming.

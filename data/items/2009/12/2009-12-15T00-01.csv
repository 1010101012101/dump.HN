There, all you've succeeded in doing is killing off two forums.<p>First, contact the admins and establish communication.  Explain what happened, and ask if they would mind changing their ToS or put a notice on their board, asking their members to stop.  From this round you can figure out if the admins did it, or if their users did it.<p>If it was the users, then you should probably look to technological solutions like CAPTCHA, user bans, IP bans, etc.  Maybe require that someone be a member for X months, or have N minimum karma before they can PM someone else.  Start filtering for certain content (URLs, names of other forums, etc.)<p>If it was the admins, you should plan on doing the same stuff, but you're probably going to be up against some more savvy folks.  Start watching your logs seriously, and step up the tech filters.  You can do things like flag suspect accounts, and filter messages to / from those accounts (if you do it silently, the other site admin won't realize his spammy techniques are ineffective).<p>Step 1: open lines of communication

995547,comment,994417,994497,0,0,grellas,,,"Under U.S. law, copyright protection automatically affixes to any original work of authorship that becomes fixed in any tangible medium of expression. It does not extend to ideas themselves.<p>Illegal copying can occur by exact copying of source or object code or by paraphrasing (misappropriating a program's structure or architecture, its inter-modular relationships, and/or its algorithms and data structures, at least insofar as these elements do not constitute unprotectable ideas - this can occur by copying the fundamental essence or structure of a copyrighted work even while rephrasing or restating it in immaterial respects).<p>Impermissible copying can also involve exact duplication of a user interface, or a ""paraphrasing"" of that interface (e.g., by creating screen displays and menu commands which are very similar but not identical to those of a copyrighted program).<p>Though interface elements can potentially be copyrighted, the advice you give is sound in most cases because of the courts' reluctance to give any party a monopoly on interface ideas in the guise of copyright (thus, Apple had sought unsuccessfully via copyright to gain exclusive use of a variety of interface elements, such as a visual depiction of a trash can). This is where ""look and feel"" cases become so difficult - who wants to give anybody exclusive rights via copyright, for example, to the basic ideas behind a spreadsheet? That is why many of those older cases failed.<p>In spite of this, I don't know that I would simply dismiss the look-and-feel aspect of this case based on the interface involved here. On its face, there appears to be more involved with this interface than mere ideas and, when there are creative forms of expression involved, and the copying is exact or so significantly ""paraphrased"" as to be almost indistinguishable, an interface infringement may have occurred.<p>All of the above, however, is based on a U.S. law analysis and may be irrelevant (at least legally) in China. If there is some way to bring U.S. legal principles into play, or anything analogous to them, then this would appear to be a fairly flagrant instance of illegal copying. While the costs of launching and pursuing a formal legal fight would be great, as long as you have a reasonable venue in which to launch it (i.e., one that respects IP rights) and the resources to carry it through to the preliminary injunction stage (usually 6 to 8 weeks into the case), winning a preliminary injunction would likely work its effect in causing Microsoft to fold, assuming it otherwise is willing before that to fight and is able to survive a horrible onslaught of bad publicity.",1260837928

I sincerely hope that you will bring a different tone here than you do on comp.lang.javascript.<p>People tend to measure the ""success"" of their libraries or other code based upon whether or not it accomplishes their goals. If your goal was to simply build a set of abstractions, continue support for ancient browsers, and ensure that it continues to work for future browsers, then you've accomplished it and that's great.<p>However, you fail then to recognize the goals of other frameworks and libraries which differ from your own. That is, they sacrifice compatibility with very old browsers for the sake of improved performance and support for newer browsers; or they sacrifice strict correctness for improved rates of development; or they sacrifice other aspects of Javascript-specific techniques for the sake of readability or establishing patterns familiar to novice programmers.<p>The authors of other frameworks can no more be criticized by you for failing to meet your goals, than we could criticize your library for failing to meet our goals.<p>Indeed, you're correct that I did not read every one of your more than 9,000 lines of code (almost 330K!) for the complete library. Rather, given your penchant for reading a few lines of some framework, critiquing them, and then declaring them to be no longer worth your time -- I thought I'd try the same.<p>...Actually, I'm being needlessly rude there. The truth is, I did attempt to review portions of code inasmuch as I had time for. Much of it was simply not notable; I picked out the camelization for one point because I had been tuning my own just a few nights ago.<p>Thanks (seriously) for pointing out the Safari 2 incompatibility. I'll consider whether adding support for Safari 2 is worth re-working that line. (Probably not, but maybe.)<p>We could continue to dicker back and forth on the relative merits of one bit of JavaScript versus another, but I'd rather keep working on mine, other people would rather start writing their own obvious unit tests, and you would hopefully rather update your library or something.",1260837582

In the meantime, jQuery has been virtually rewritten to get rid of the browser sniffing.

It's used in exactly two places and neither has anything to do with styles.  Instead, it deals with (very rarely encountered) hyphenated _attributes_ (you should have guessed, or God forbid read the code you were criticizing).<p>And aren't you just picking one (tiny) bit that you can sort of relate to and mouthing off without any real clue about what you are talking about?  <whine>And why didn't _you_ report it to the author to be constructive, build a community, etc.  What an awful jerk!</whine><p>BTW, your version will blow up in Safari 2 due to the function passed to replace.

For example, a network of resistors representing the weights, with a feed back loop that adjusts (continuously) the resistances during the learning process.<p>After the network has attained sufficient level of AI, we won&#x27;t be able to read back the final value of resistances with the required precision.

10182784,comment,10181612,10181612,0,0,ThePhysicist,,,"I encountered the &quot;memory hogging&quot; behavior of Python processes once, where I was sure that my GC worked correctly and that I released all unused objects but still the memory of the process would keep growing. I also remember having this problem with a C++ once as well. It doesn&#x27;t seem a problem though since the OS should normally release the memory if it&#x27;s needed by another process. Still, this kind of behavior can definitely drive you nuts.<p>BTW Celery is usually not a good fit for long running processes, because if you have many of those processes running in parallel within a production system it will get really difficult restarting the Celerey daemon as it will have to wait for all these processes to stop (during which no new tasks can be processed). Why restart at all you ask? Well, restarting is necessary to reload the code, as it is not recommended to use the autoreloader in a production system. This problem persists even when using the multiprocessing module btw (as the author suggested), since on Linux Python uses fork() to create a new process, thereby just copying the whole memory of the given process.",1441655813

If you use a stack instead of a queue then a person who arrived at 11AM and sees the number of people in line in front of them continue to increase will correctly deduce that continuing to wait is futile. They won&#x27;t be served until ~1PM when the entire backlog is filled, so assuming they aren&#x27;t allowed to reposition themselves in line immediately, they might as well just leave and come back later.<p>Which is a big assumption.<p>That&#x27;s exactly what the GP was warning about: people will just go into a different &quot;meta-queue&quot; in which they vie for being the technically-&quot;last&quot; person to enter the real (LIFO) queue [1], with all the externalities that involves. People are still spending time waiting, they just have to do it in a more roundabout way. No free lunch (in money or time).<p>>And maybe resolve to get there by 10:45 next time, when demand is lower and everyone is still being served immediately. Which is where the efficiency comes from -- more people arrive either before or after the rush to avoid getting stuck at the bottom of the stack, so the wait time goes down.<p>So ... the entire counterintuitive result is just an artifact of how this method makes it more expensive (in time spent, assuming away the meta-queueing problem above) at peak times? But then it&#x27;s no different from the case for peak-hour pricing (or the opposite in the case of happy hours and early bird specials).<p>So it&#x27;s not that this is somehow more efficient, it&#x27;s apparently just another way to make peak hour service more miserable. But worse, it does it in a very convoluted way that shifts the entire problem over to &quot;how to game the official record of when I entered the stack&quot;.<p>This whole study seems to confuse a lot more than it clarifies.<p>[1] which, I know, would no longer be a queue but a stack",1441655802

You implement an assembler first. Then a macro assembler with macro&#x27;s for HLL primitives. You can use that immediately to jmplement certified compiler. Alternately, you can pick up Oberon report or Scheme book to implement that to get a true HLL plus compiler. Then you implememt the certified compiler with it. Comprehension, code complexity, and trust are kept manageable by building layer by layer. This, for productivity not security, is how Wirth and Carl first built Lilith then Oberon.

Like many companies that do really well, they eventually squandered that edge.<p>To answer you question... why did people used Suns for several reasons. These reasons are <i>not</i> in any quantitative order.<p>1. Religion - many people watched people smarter than them achieve success with Sun. Given their growing market size, they had a bigger religion. So whenever somebody tried something different and failed, it reinforced the religion. This lasted for quite some time (til early 2000&#x27;s). Once the internet hit (1995,1996), just believing in this religion was a successful move.<p>2. Educational market. Sun gave educational institutions discounts. Students and Professors liked Suns and that created momentum when they left. Remember, even to this day, some people will stick with a system just because they know it better.<p>3. Sun systems were typically more data center friendly than SGI, HP, PCs, and especially SGI. They had serial consoles with OpenBOOT for lights-out-management - this was huge. They also stacked up nicely and fit into racks easily. If you knew what you were doing, you could do everything remote.<p>4. Many solutions had Sun picked as their configuration. For example, if you wanted to run Oracle or Veritas, you must buy Sun.\nIt was not uncommon to see Oracle, Veritas, Sun, and Cisco all over the place in any data center in the valley. That was the <i>template</i>.<p>5. Much lower risk for hardware integration at scale. The hardware was targeted for Unix and scale. You knew that you could put 8 gigs in that Sun. You knew that the EMC RAID was going to work. So, spend the $, and move on to the problem. This was not the case with PCs. Sometimes that Intel motherboard, or hard-drive, or mis-spec&#x27;d RAM burned you on PC hardware. This could cost a lot of time and $$.<p>6. OS Maturity - they had just enough of an edge on the competition here. With a small amount of work, you could have something that could reboot quickly and stay up. The monitoring and tracing tools were much better. With skilled people, you could really make these systems work really well. This was in a time when many kernels had bugs and couldn&#x27;t stay up for longer than 24-48 hours under normal load. SGI Irix was a great design, but many skilled people still had issues. I remember HPUX requiring weekly patch sets. The internet really exposed how bad these OSs were for server usage.<p>7. Java - once Java took off, that created a halo effect for Sun hardware.<p>This combination created an enormous wave of $$$ to go to Sun.<p>Sun had its warts for sure, but SGI, HP, DEC, etc all blew it compared to Sun.<p>BTW, I was always more of a NeXT guy (we all had our religions), but I respected and liked Sun solutions. However, once I saw what a Pentium Pro combined with the maturity of FreeBSD (1997), I knew the workstation guys were in serious trouble.",1441655107

10182713,comment,10181556,10182552,0,0,xoa,,,"<i>All</i> security is an <i>economic equation</i>. All of it. Anything that increases the overall time/energy cost for an attacker represents an increase in security. Security is also heavily defined by lowest energy failure points and the human interface cost/benefit factor (because security itself often takes time/energy, so there&#x27;s no point in expending more then whatever is being guarded is worth). In this scenario, both come into play in a way you&#x27;re not giving credit to. I can&#x27;t speak to your situation, but large numbers of us do not live in heavily armored homes packed with alarm systems. The door lock is essentially a mixture of minimal energy cost/social message (&quot;nobody is home and you are not invited to just wander in&quot;) and a canary system (if someone does break it, it&#x27;ll be obvious it happened).<p>It&#x27;s become trendy any time someone mentions biometrics to talk about &quot;finger prints being everywhere&quot; and all that, but it&#x27;s always incorrect to do so in a security discussion without considering overall economics. The fact is that, at least for now, it is not trivial to find, lift, and duplicate a fingerprint to the level needed to fool a decent reader (ala Touch ID). Long before it&#x27;s worth doing that, a typical crook would simply break a window (including a door window should any exterior door in your entire house have any glass) or, likeliest of all, simply go to another house. Much of the low level crime that takes place is because a crook is interested in getting <i>someone</i>, not <i>you</i> specifically. It&#x27;s a numbers game, it&#x27;s not worth it to go to a lot of effort against one somewhat more secured building when the one next door may be wide open. Conversely, if you&#x27;re subject to an actual persistent targeted physical threat then you&#x27;ve got vastly bigger problems then most are equipped to easily deal with. You have to make sure keys don&#x27;t get stolen/duped, that hidden cameras aren&#x27;t installed, that professionals can&#x27;t pick or use more advanced subtle physical bypasses, etc etc.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s necessary to compare to what the actual practical alternatives currently in place are. &quot;Key under the mat/behind the flower pot/fake rock on lawn/...&quot; or some variant is how a huge number of homes currently deal with fallback entry. Even if in general a copy of keys are carried around, being able to get into one&#x27;s home no matter what is important enough that many people will at keep least one copy on premises in case they forget/lose theirs or a guest needs to get in or something. That&#x27;s not a high baseline to surpass.<p>So there&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with using biometrics in scenarios like this. They&#x27;re convenient, audit-able, cannot be lost or forgotten, and are often at least as good against expected attack scenarios as what currently is in place. There are certainly ways to make it even better, or promising alternates. Using a different factor (like a pin or electronic) key as the primary option with biometric fallback (in an electronic system fallback usage could be used as a trigger), time fencing, combining it with another option for MFA, or in the future directly improving &quot;something you are&quot; (such as with implants) all could be considered. But right now it&#x27;s perfectly appropriate security for many homes. If anything my major concern would not be security but rather reliability, so I&#x27;d never use it exclusively. But it&#x27;s silly to just write it off purely because it could be bypassed with sufficient time/energy/expertise.",1441654672

I use OpenHAB in my home, which is an open-source home automation server. It can run on anything from a RPi to a blade with just a few necessary additions (namely a Z-Wave dongle and some sort of network connection.)<p>OpenHAB requires a fair bit of programming knowledge and the learning curve can be steep for some, but overall it&#x27;s very functional. A few things I do in my house:<p>- When the garage door opens and it&#x27;s after sunset, the hallway lights turn on and set themselves to 50% brightness.<p>- When I start watching a show on PleX, the living room lights fade out. If the show is paused, they&#x27;ll come up enough for me to navigate around and refill my drink.<p>- When both my girlfriend and I are gone from the house, the A/C shuts off. When it detects we&#x27;re within 1/2 mile of the house, it&#x27;ll come back on so it&#x27;s comfortable when we arrive.<p>There&#x27;s a million other things you can do with OpenHAB. It has hundreds of &quot;bindings&quot; to different HA products and supports HTTP endpoints, etc. Proprietary standards are bound to go away eventually, but open standards with open-source software will always be around.",1441654008

Yes, the CompCert compiler is certified, but the problem is that the compiler that bootstrapped CompCert may not be. If you use some compiler (let&#x27;s call it gccb, for backdoored gcc) to bootstrap CompCert that outputs ccb (backdoored compcert). Now you recompile CompCert with ccb since CompCert is certified. This gets you a final version of CompCert compiled with a bootstrapped CompCert. So the process is gccb -> ccb -> cc. But then the backdoor has just been transmitted down the line to cc.<p>Edit: also I just looked and it appears that CompCert is written in OCaml. This doesn&#x27;t substantively change anything above. It just means that rather than having a backdoored gcc you&#x27;d have a backdoored ocamlc.<p>Realistically the only way to truly assure that your compiler is not backdoored is by writing it yourself in assembly. But then, your assembler might be backdoored. So you need to write your own assembler in binary. But then your processor might be backdoored. So you need to design your own processor. And then you might be safe. Of course, if someone really cared enough to backdoor all that stuff, they&#x27;d probably just come after you with a rubber hose at that point.

If you always had less than one person arriving per minute and it took less than one minute to process one person then there would be no need for ordering the people waiting because there would be no people waiting.<p>The trouble arises when that isn&#x27;t what happens. At 10AM there is no line at the lunch counter but by 11AM or noon there are more people looking for food than there is serving capacity, so a line forms and remains until 1PM or 2PM when the rate of new customers has fallen back below serving capacity for long enough to process the backlog.<p>A queue is inefficient because it causes everyone to wait e.g. 15 minutes during the busy period. If you use a stack instead of a queue then a person who arrived at 11AM and sees the number of people in line in front of them continue to increase will correctly deduce that continuing to wait is futile. They won&#x27;t be served until ~1PM when the entire backlog is filled, so assuming they aren&#x27;t allowed to reposition themselves in line <i>immediately</i>, they might as well just leave and come back later. And maybe resolve to get there by 10:45 next time, when demand is lower and everyone is still being served immediately. Which is where the efficiency comes from -- more people arrive either before or after the rush to avoid getting stuck at the bottom of the stack, so the wait time goes down.<p>The trouble with it is that it lowers the average wait time but it makes the wait time for any particular individual completely unpredictable. You could end up being second to the top of the stack for several hours while everyone else is served immediately.",1441653171

10182614,comment,10177775,10178598,0,0,bshanks,,,"I propose one simple reform. The grant-giving institutions are currently (in the aggregate) spending $X of money per year to pay the salary of various people. Some of these people are employed as tenured professors, some as non-yet-tenured tenure track professors, some as postdocs, some as students. The salary of the postdocs and students (if any) is coming entirely from the $X, the salary of the professors is coming partly from interest on the schools&#x27; endowments. The number of postdocs and students is (almost) directly proportional to $X.<p>The proposal: the grant-giving institution instead earmark Z% of $X for endowing new tenured professor chairs at the schools.<p>This reduces the ratio of (postdocs + students) per professor. In the extreme case, if all institutions set Z=100%, there would be only professors and no students or postdocs; the number of professors would be less than the number of professors+postdocs+students is today, but this number would be growing at a substantially faster rate (there will be some critical value of Z, large but <100%, such that the the number of students funded is roughly equal to or slightly greater than the replacement rate of retiring professors). Note that this is not all-or-nothing; you can incrementally convince one grant-giving institution at a time to implement this reform, with Z set at various levels, and see incremental benefits.",1441652913

Again, it&#x27;s great to have people working on this and better if the companies using Linux support developers working on the problem but it&#x27;s only a deal-breaker for a much smaller number of people.<p>Just to use an example which you see a lot today: how many of the developers jumping on Docker care that much about network performance at this level? I would argue that continued development of the container system has done more to boost Linux usage than low-level networking performance, even though both are entirely legitimate and worthwhile concerns worth developer sponsorship. (ZFS has pulled in the opposite direction for people who care about storage)<p>From the other direction, imagine if *BSD had gotten serious about package management by the mid-to-late 90s when it was obvious how much better the experience was on Debian so that a generation of developers wasn&#x27;t trained to favor Linux to avoid getting sucked into dependency management.

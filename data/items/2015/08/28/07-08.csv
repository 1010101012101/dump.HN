Anyways, after you&#x27;ve successfully gotten the number down to something reasonable you proceed to... make your decision based almost entirely on a picture.<p>The actual important thing to realize about Tinder is that it maximizes the only metric that matters: face to face contact.

However like any advice, it&#x27;s very generalized and won&#x27;t necessarily apply.<p>I definitely learned a lot working as a freelancer and in a agency solving different kinds of problems. The startup problem set is usually narrow with variety of random things. Many startups are also not that willing to actually invest in design (time or money wise), and it might not even make sense since they are just trying not to die.<p>Many startups are not also not founded by designers, and won&#x27;t really understand design which also makes it harder to learn or practice good design. (As devs, think about a startup founded by sales MBAs and try to teach them good dev practices and make them understand what it is the value in it.)<p>I&#x27;ve also never worked at a startup where I could see someone as my design mentor. Most of the time, you will just have to figure things out by yourself.<p>I&#x27;d still say that you learn a lot at a startup, and it can be a good place for junior or more senior designers. It&#x27;s about creating and nurturing one overall experience and product and learning as you go.

While everybody pretends their particular organization size and type is supreme, it all comes out in the wash. Sure, startups move marginally faster. The time for reflection and self-analysis is lesser and most people seem to get less out of what they do, learn less from their mistakes, have generally poorer leadership that can&#x27;t devote the time to helping more inexperienced employees learn the lessons they <i>should</i> learn from those mistakes and help them grow both as practitioners of a craft and as human beings.<p>And I&#x27;m gonna be honest: the assumption that a mentor has fear-based motives for ensuring that your work has greater benefits than the risk it poses is so utterly unrelated to reality in the general case, so monstrously projective and in itself pathologically fear-based, that I have trouble believing somebody would state it in good faith as such a universality. (To the newbie: your highly-self-regarded work is risky. Unknown commodities are always risky. If you are not analyzing your actions as a leader through the lens of risk, you are a bad leader. Many startups don&#x27;t do this. They have bad leaders, too. But the understanding of and formalization of this is not something taught to entry-level employees at that move-fast-die-fast startup, because all too often, <i>nobody else knows about it either</i>.)<p>This is not to say that there are not startups where one can learn and thrive, because obviously they exist in some proportion. I would say, and the failure rates of startups and the it-was-my-first-job candidates I&#x27;ve seen ejected from the crashing wrecks strongly push me in this direction, that it certainly seems significantly harder to learn how to be directed and effective (as opposed to thrashy and high-effort) in such an environment. But it&#x27;s certainly possible. Nor would I say that there isn&#x27;t a very good time to leave a big company--I bailed two years to the day and probably stayed six months longer than I needed to in order to be a good <i>engineer</i> rather than a good <i>coder</i>.<p>But there is no generalization that holds, in either direction, as universally as your post asserts, and the assumption of such is foolish.",1440745550

The endowment is large because of several 'home runs,' in the fundraising parlance, specifically Gordon Moore's $600M donation in 2003, the largest donation to higher education ever and hundreds of millions in smaller donations by the Moore Foundation, as well as other large ticket donations by successful Caltech alumni and LA notables, like Eli Broad. The JPL budget is separated out from the Caltech general operating budget, which you can learn more about here: <a href=""http://annual-report.caltech.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://annual-report.caltech.edu/</a><p>We were actually offered Los Alamos, too, after several security breaches under their UCLA managers, but our faculty board turned it down, resulting in UCLA getting the contract again.

If you move to the south, then Taiwanese is also important, but you can get by with Chinese.  English does not go far beyond foreign bars and western companies.<p>Couple of things.  In the north the weather can be miserable in winter --humid/rainy and cold.  It hardly drops to freezing, but it's bone chilling.  In the south you have to think about pollution.  It's really bad and it's dreadfully hot in the summer --I mean intolerably hot (most of the time it's ok b/c you're indoors with AC, but once you step outside you get drenched within a minute.  There's an expression for respiratory problems people might develop in the industrial south ""Kaohsiung Lung"" for a kind of cough which some people develop in response to the pollution.<p>Some good things, taxes are quite reasonable.  People are friendly and most things are relatively cheap -unless you are looking at Japanese and Western products, then they are expensive.  You can drive w/o a license pretty much without repercussions, but if you're staying long, go thru the process, it's worth it.  Healthcare, it's taken care of for you when you get a job.  Co-pay is ridiculously low.  Procedures are low.  The medicine is pretty much up to standard, but realize most hospitals are privately owned by millionaires.  Food is abundant and available at all hours of the day and night  -for cheap.  Again, unless you are looking for excellent Japanese or Western food, then you pay.  Utilities are cheap.  While apartments and condos are great, houses are weird.  They are these weird 4 to 6 story very narrow monstrosities with very bad usability design, in my opinion.  Government offices, from my experiences were very efficient --nothing required hour waits nor return visits (unless you forget a document).  Documents are simple --but you need to understand Chinese of have someone help you).<p>Housing is cheap, unless you need to live in a ""western compound"" then it gets expensive.<p>Other bad things: traffic.  Unless you can use the MRT (in Kaohsiung or Taipei) you will have to ride a scooter (or drive a car).  Don't get into an accident.  You will most likely have to pay a settlement fee -esp being a foreigner.  There is no ""central heating"" so get used to cold winters in TPE.  You run out of places to visit quite soon, so you might have to hop over to Japan.  Driving is kind of ruleless.  Well, they have rules but most people ignore them so it's very chaotic.  There are no sidewalks.  It looks like they exist, but they don't.  What look like sidewalks are actually private property, most of the time used for scooter parking or for business fronts.  The ""sidewalk"" are the actual streets --but since they are the street proper, they are dangerous --which is why people ride scooters for a half block errand (it seemed ridiculous at first, but it makes sense as you will earn).<p>Crime exists but for the most part, it's hidden from westerners --just don't try to pick up or look at a gangster's GF or whatever and you'll be ok  -however, this is unlikely to happen, unless you go to ""local bars""/KTVs/Touch-touch places as opposed to foreigner bars.  ""Gangsters"" sport tattoos, short hair and some chew betel nut (bing lan).  Guns are few, but knives are plentiful.<p>Good luck.",1294694748

There will always be an ""open"" Mac, in the sense that there will always be a Mac you can develop on, if only by neccessity.<p>Let's consider what happens if I'm wrong. Even though we're (hackers) a tiny part of the market, we're not a ""small"" group by any measure. Imagine that all the talented people who like using OS X for development are suddenly forced to use Linux. So, you have this large group of talented people, and all of the sudden their platform is yanked out from under them. Where do they go? They go to the platform that solves their needs. They go to the next thing. That thing would be Linux.<p>I don't believe there will be any rug-yanking going on.

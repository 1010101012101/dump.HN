I think I figured out how to describe why it sounds weird in this case.<p>When you use a car, you&#x27;re usually driving on public roads. But you don&#x27;t say &quot;hey honey, would you like to use the road to get some chinese food?&quot; because the application you (the user) are using directly is not the road, it&#x27;s the car. The car just happens to use the road as a means of interconnection from home to the chinese takeout place.<p>There can be many kinds of distributed systems of servers deployed in multiple data centers across the Internet to serve content to end-users. But often these serve other functions besides just distributing content. The underlying principle of a CDN is that it just moves content around, regardless of what it is.<p>With Google Fonts, you aren&#x27;t using a tool to move content around. You&#x27;re using an API to control an application that manipulates fonts. It just happens to be running on a network that distributes the content around in the background. Google Fonts <i>uses</i> a CDN to give you content, but it&#x27;s far more complex than a typical CDN, and your use of it is merely to distribute content, but to specifically access and manipulate fonts.",1392667190

If you look beyond the borders of your country, it&#x27;s perfectly possible to study at a relatively high-ranked university for a small tuition fee. E.g., the university where I studied in The Netherlands has a rank hovering between 78 and 98 in various ratings (e.g.  Times Higher Education World University Rankings).

It&#x27;s primary goal is to be the best possible build pipeline, and should be programmatically accessible to your existing task runner.<p>Anyways, since I didn&#x27;t really compare grunt/gulp with broccoli, let me explain what you get:<p>* primitives make sense, was able to get a fairly non-trivial or ordinary pipeline setup really quickly<p>* builds so fast, you don&#x27;t notice them.<p>* accurately handles changes (deletions and git branch changes tend to often cause similar tools issues)<p>* doesn&#x27;t lose changes that occur while building<p>* true pipeline. eg. describe the transforms, and the system handles the rest. No needing to construct make-shift pipelines yourself<p>* immediately usable as server (error reporting, locking)<p>* development builds.<p>* minified source mapped production builds.<p>* the Broccolifile API is well suited for constructing custom piplines<p>And finally:<p>the above you essentially get for free, if you need customizations the Broccoli file provides are an API well suited for the task.",1392667135

7254106,comment,7253501,7253501,4,0,knappador,,,"Work for a year, then go to school.  It will measure your skill vs your expectations.  It will inform you as to the value in being where you are as opposed to where you think you can be with four years time focused in a few mostly parallel directions.  It will ground you in the realities of making money how you can now compared to how you might.  It will prepare you for working while in school so you can kill five (or more) birds with one stone.  You can get soft working skills at the same time as your actual work skill increases without having to be dedicated to a career.<p>I can&#x27;t stress this part enough:  Pre-debt expenses amount to what, $2k per month?  After you have debt and likely start carrying other expensive things around, you&#x27;re under more income stress.  Income when your expenses are small is highly gratifying.  Income when your expenses are large is like a treadmill if it isn&#x27;t high enough.  You will enjoy pre-debt money more than any other money you will ever have until you are out of debt.  Might as start life with a breather.<p>In school, you can change your career much more freely, but you have to intersect back with reality somewhere or else you aren&#x27;t changing anything.  While working, you&#x27;re too busy working and doing lead generation etc to focus on changing your skill set drastically.  Being independent ultimately makes this less of a problem, but doesn&#x27;t make it go away.  The classes that are a waste of time are only a waste of time when you don&#x27;t pick them well or have no options for a particular semester, in which case you will have a similarly distracting workload, though honestly, once you&#x27;ve worked any crazy time, undergraduate is a f&*@ing joke that most people there (especially at state schools) are simply wanting a crutch to delay the adolescence-adult life transition.<p>College is a very good opportunity to change cities without getting super committed to a new area and without having to line up work in two places, which you have to do in career world.  You have to have runway at point A and somewhat of a a landing at point B.  That&#x27;s a lot of headache and fortune compared to,  &quot;Oh cool, so I&#x27;ll go move to that place and take out X loans.&quot;<p>Meeting people is not a bad side-effect.  Out in the mix, you find rarely random people your age of similar life status who you can peer with and never in such large concentrations.  People who are out of college in your age group will be of different lives than career folk.  Just the truth.  You might be egalitarian and non-judgmental, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re going to want to feel like your time is better spent elsewhere.",1392667092

7254088,comment,7250952,7253572,3,0,nswanberg,,,"Assuming these are genuine and not the world&#x27;s longest rhetorical questions:<p>1) There is nothing wrong with your approach. There is nothing that can be done using ASP.NET MVC that cannot be done with the ASP.NET Webforms pattern (I&#x27;m not sure if there is a generic term for the single-file pattern that classic ASP, JSP, AOLServer, etc use). You are smart and working alone, and quite likely the innovations in your application will not be made in the way in which you concatenate strings to generate HTML.<p>2) Again, you are not missing anything by using your years of experience with KEdit and Rexx, except possibly a job working on internal HR applications at an insurance company. Intellisense and VWD are tools designed for programmers with a range of experience to be productive enough so as not to be a net loss for their team. I make websites with ASP.NET MVC and use Visual Studio to do it. Would I consider KEdit? Probably not--I lack your experience with KEdit, and when I want to deal exclusively with text I use Emacs. And why use intellisense? Your method of creating abstracts for the .NET class library is a great one, and one that a lot of people could learn from. But that is not reality in the everyday .NET development world. Intellisense allows those developers to navigate both the .NET libraries and their teammates&#x27; ad-hoc classes.<p>3) I&#x27;ll pass--I didn&#x27;t watch the video.<p>4) Almost certainly the text box was generated as an example. It&#x27;s possible that most sites using javascript nowadays do so only because yet other sites use javascript. But where javascript is used well it is indispensable. Part of the original appeal of both Google Maps and Gmail was the pleasant user interface enabled with javascript. If your site is a means to an end and the users are willing to put a lot of effort into the result--say, as an extreme example, a form that takes some account information and literally gives the user  money--there is little you could gain from javascript. But if you want to do what you can to make a user&#x27;s experience a pleasant or even delightful one, javascript is frequently the best way to achieve that.",1392666918

If you have no prior work experience you&#x27;ll have a hard time finding someone to take a chance on you much less pay you 6k a month.  Statistically speaking highschool graduates earn less on average than those with bachelors or associates. If you don&#x27;t have a bachelors you will need at least fours years of full time experience as a front-end dev to compensate.<p>My first job after I earned my bachelors was as a front end developer and I was only making 4k a month (in Minnesota circa 2012) however it took me 8 months of searching (i think i cold called/submitted resumes to 50+ companies) and enlisting the help of two separate creative recruiting agencies as well as other individual recruiters who contacted me through sites like monster etc. It took that many people to help me find a job even when I had a 4 year degree from a school with a name that carried weight in the local community.<p>I tested the waters in SF as well by sending resumes to a few startups and I got a call one day from a recruiter. He went on to tell me that he really liked my design work and that I had a good eye for it but unfortunately my resume was simply too lacking in experience and no one was going to even consider me without 2-3 years of full time experience. He was really cool about it,  taking the time out of his day to help me level me expectations as well as giving me some advice.<p>My suggestion would be to pursue a degree, even if it&#x27;s just an associates.

To be sure, I memorized a lot in school, at least long enough to regurgitate it on tests or briefly apply it in contrived class projects.  However, I didn&#x27;t permanently ABSORB that knowledge until entering the workplace.  Working on non-trivial projects, enduring code reviews with very smart senior people, etc.<p>Perhaps having gone through a CS curriculum left marks on my subconscious, and made it easier to learn in the real world.  I don&#x27;t know.  However, I certainly felt like a babe in the woods at my first job after graduation.  A CS program did not equip me for the brass tacks I needed as a junior level programmer.  By the time I reached the point in my career when I was making design decisions and needed strong CS knowledge, I was years out of school and was learning (or re-learning) those concepts through other means.<p>On the other hand, I would say that it&#x27;s foolishly short-sighted to forgo the credential on your resume.  It is less important when you&#x27;re young, and working for startups or small shops.  However, with age you will eventually find yourself working for larger and more conservative companies (yes, there are exceptions to the rule, but how many 60-year old coders to you meet at the typical startup?).  You simply MUST have a degree in order to get past the H.R. drones in those environments.  Hell, this is still OFTEN the case even in small shops.<p>You can get around this glass ceiling by going into business for yourself.  Running your own startup, or consulting practice... building a network, drumming up clients, and bypassing H.R.  However, not everyone is made for that life.  It&#x27;s really more of a business career than it is a technical one.  Also, what sounds exciting in your 20&#x27;s might be a completely different story when you&#x27;re in your 40&#x27;s with a family... but at that point you&#x27;re still 20+ years from retirement!<p>To sum it up, I don&#x27;t know that you need a degree to be a strong software developer... but it IS a really important credential for the long-haul, which is easier to get under your belt when you&#x27;re young.  I should add that there&#x27;s NO need to spend $100K or more on this.  Although you need a degree to get past many H.R. drones, no one cares where your degree came from (or oftentimes whether you majored in CS even!).<p>If I were 18-years old now, in today&#x27;s climate of crazy tuition costs, I would go route of spending two years in community college knocking out my core, and then transfer to a university for my major.  Only the university shows up on your resume anyway, and no one cares.  At the very least, I would attend a state school rather than a private institution.  You might even consider pursuing your degree through night classes, while working by day.  That&#x27;s a PAINFUL lifestyle, but much more doable when you&#x27;re young and don&#x27;t have a family yet.",1392666224

If they weren&#x27;t doing something, anything with the startup, they would either a) be doing something, anything without the startup (pain point) or b) experiencing a need-state (something, anything as a latent need that they are not using.)  This would follow from definitions.<p>If you&#x27;re not begging the question, could you propose a hypothetical startup as a counterexample, i.e. describe a startup that would not be solving a pain point or need-state of some sort, if we imagine the (counterfactual) scenario that people do however use it.<p>For example: if a startup sells you the right to remove a virus (that you didn&#x27;t know about, and which doesn&#x27;t exist).  Is this a pain point?  Is this a latent need?  By definition it would have to be, as you are paying for it.  That&#x27;s why I say you&#x27;re begging the question.  Kaspersky by definition is filling the need to feel secure (by the definition that they are actually making sales.)<p>If a fitness company really sells you the knowledge that you&#x27;re at least doing something, by staying enrolled, even though its model depends on 90% of people not showing up.  That would be an example.  Are they filling a need to be enrolled, without going?  By definition, they are.<p>If these skinner-box games (apps) get traction, without being fun, then are they filling a need?  By definition they are.  Zynga by definition is filling a need to &quot;casually game&quot;.  (By the definition that they are doing so.)<p>McDonald&#x27;s is by definition filling a need for McDonald&#x27;s food and/or experience etc.<p>So to talk about &#x27;needs&#x27; or &#x27;pain points&#x27; are both somewhat silly, if we get to define these things as anything you can get people to do.  (Your chance at a counterexample would be to state something you can get people to do, that would not be a latent need or a pain point - for example if you get people to behave very irrationally to use your service.  Go ahead and try to come up with examples.)<p>Specifically, I don&#x27;t think people felt &quot;pain&quot; over not having a Facebook wall of their friends&#x27; updates.  It&#x27;s just something Facebook created for them.  It&#x27;s no good to retroactively say that it was an &#x27;unfilled need&#x27; as by definition this would be a catch-all for anything that doesn&#x27;t fit in the first bucket, of pain points.<p>Basically, I am saying that if a startup does anything, it would fit by definition into something that was already done, and therefore a pain-point, or something that wasn&#x27;t already done, and therefore a latent need the moment you start selling it, retroactively, since the beginning of time.  The moment the first of something is used or sold it becomes a retroactive latent need going back to the beginning of time.  It&#x27;s simply begging the question completely.<p>Nor is this a shallow observation.  If we switched it to, &quot;build something that people will use&quot;, then that is not a very good answer to how to get your first 100 users, as the definition of something that people will use, is something that people use.  By definition you can get 100 users if you build something that a hundred people will use...<p>I suppose you can make deeper observation that the goal of a startup is to make something that people independently will decide to use based on a description alone, or an initial experience, or their friends using it, or its having social prestige, or based on a specific advertising copy, or in the context of the industry and other advertising they&#x27;ve seen, or based on their historical purchasing habits and impressions,  or . . . . . . . . .<p>you see, as soon as you make it deeper, it no longer fits your buckets at all, really.  At most we can make it a shorthand for, &quot;produce a company that you would be a customer of&quot;, since you can probably judge introspectively whether that you would be a customer if you were still an outsider, given the company&#x27;s products, copy, marketing, etc.<p>But make no mistake: plenty of successful startups do not have the kind of offering their founders would have jumped at.",1392666063

This could lead to misery, especially if you lose interest in what the school is teaching. The networking benefit of school is overrated; networking with other professionals is better than networking with other students. (You can also more easily get around degree requirements if you&#x27;re getting a job at a company where someone you know already works there.) The &#x27;variety of topics&#x27; at schools is overrated too; you can get such a broader knowledge of things in your spare time, and as another commenter mentioned front-end dev is rarely covered at all in a CS degree and you can learn so many other things not covered just from doing your job.<p>I would recommend actually learning about the material covered in a CS degree in your spare time. Use your job money to buy a few books -- if you don&#x27;t know what to buy, many schools have a required/suggested book list organized by course. Two I&#x27;d recommend are Pike and Kernighan&#x27;s <i>The Practice of Programming</i> and Skiena&#x27;s <i>The algorithm design manual</i>, the latter of which goes over enough CS that if you ever wanted a &quot;Software Engineer&quot; job instead of front-end work you would be able to handle most any technical interview question.",1392666052

It&#x27;s not your fault, just when and where you are born. The Boomers stole the future and that&#x27;s why housing and education are so expensive. The higher education industry has been using its gateway to the middle-class job market as a extortion racket for decades, erecting gigantic buildings while depriving the middle class of savings-- sapping parents of the upper-middle-class and putting the lower-middle aka &quot;working&quot; class (sorry, but that&#x27;s you, if you&#x27;re worried about $50-100k of debt) into indentured servitude. It&#x27;s bullshit, it&#x27;s horrible, it&#x27;s wasteful, and it&#x27;s wrong. It&#x27;s not at all your fault. But we can&#x27;t change any of that, now can we?<p>First of all, <i>yes</i> you should go. I actually think you should aim for Stanford or Harvard if you can pass admissions. I&#x27;d advise a state school with a full ride over Harvard with debt, but if you&#x27;re already going to be in debt, you might as well swing for the fences. The quality of education isn&#x27;t that much better (variations within schools-- of professor, class, and student quality-- are much greater than those between them) but the connections and brand matter, especially if you want to do Silicon Valley or Wall Street.<p>Degree snobbery is <i>huge</i>, even in software. People don&#x27;t admit to it, because it&#x27;s socially unacceptable-- let&#x27;s be honest, here; even the supposedly meritocratic game of college admissions is 75% socioeconomic status-- but that&#x27;s the truth. You might be able to establish yourself in front-end engineering, develop independent credibility, and move forward from there. Might. If the market goes south, you&#x27;ll be one of the first ones sloughed off. Also, when you&#x27;re 35-- I&#x27;m 30 and age comes quicker than you&#x27;d think-- you might get tired of typical software bullshit and want to move into R&D, or go for finance, or to become a founder. All of those are going to want to see degrees, and good ones. (UIUC is good, especially for graduate school. Stanford will open the Valley; Harvard&#x27;s best if you want Wall Street.) Most R&D labs have PhD Bigotry issues, and Wall Street isn&#x27;t bigoted <i>per se</i> but is just really competitive and the degree can cut you in.<p>Here&#x27;s one thing about degrees. I went to a great but not-that-well-known undergraduate college (Carleton, in MN). I do not have a graduate degree (did one year in a math PhD program, left for Wall Street). Now, to be blunt, I&#x27;m smart as fuck and top-5% material (probably top-1%) even in the Harvard, Stanford, MIT pool that is chasing venture funding away. If I need to prove my intelligence, I always can, and it&#x27;s not hard for me. <i>But</i> it is always better to be presumed smart than to have to prove it. Why? Because impressions are made quickly (120 seconds) and it&#x27;s really hard (nearly impossible) to prove top-flight intelligence <i>quickly</i> without also being socially unacceptable (or, in clearer terms, sounding smart but full of yourself). Better to have your degree talk you up for you; it can be your career wingman. Degrees fucking matter; don&#x27;t listen to the people who say otherwise. They&#x27;re divided between people who don&#x27;t have elite degrees and are deluding themselves or unaware of the opportunities they&#x27;re missing, and those who do have the degrees but want to downplay their effect (for obvious reasons).<p>You may want to work for 2 years and build up some savings and work experience (in light of the $60-80k job, if that&#x27;s available to you). That can also make you &quot;nontraditional&quot; and it can help you in admissions. You may also want to apply for scholarships in that time. I wouldn&#x27;t take more than 2 years out of education, though, and only for full-time employment is it socially acceptable (in the US) to take a gap year. Non-work, non-military gap years for Americans scream &quot;upper-middle-class shiftless fuck&quot;-- you know, the idiots who &quot;travel&quot; on their parents&#x27; dime to &quot;find themselves&quot; and really just drink and slut it up-- even if you&#x27;re the opposite of that. But you can justify a work gap year or two by just saying, matter-of-factly, that you needed the money. No one will question you further. People who can pay their way though college, this day in age, are impressive as fuck because that ain&#x27;t easy.<p>There are also subjective reasons to go to college. Computer science is a really beautiful field and even I find myself wishing I knew more about it. I won&#x27;t cover them as much. Some people learn a ton without schooling, others go to impressive schools and learn nothing. That one&#x27;s more up to you. I think the objective case for getting your degree is much stronger.<p>Good luck. And read hglaser&#x27;s post. He says a lot of things I would have included in mine but he already covered them.",1392665961

I am entirely self-taught with computers, with no academic credentials. I didn&#x27;t even take CS courses while in college. I am not a failure career-wise, but I believe that a CS, EE, or similar degree, in hind-sight, would have helped me.<p>There&#x27;s 3 main reasons for this:<p>1) there is a lot of conceptual and algorithm stuff that is drummed into people at school that, while possible to learn on one&#x27;s own, requires time and effort. If I had time to study Knuth in depth, I would love to do so. This subject matter is very often useful--in hindsight, this is my biggest regret for not having studied CS, because there are gaps in my knowledge that would have been easy to fill had I been studying these things long ago.<p>2) while employers generally do not <i>require</i> a CS degree, it is very often that their employment screening steps will filter you out if you cannot regurgitate much of the stuff described in step 1: algorithms and coding styles taught in college, the way that colleges teach them. No matter how much PR a company claims for itself in looking for intelligence, creativity, and experience, if you haven&#x27;t internalized the textbook stuff, then you&#x27;ll frequently get filtered out of interview process quite early. You&#x27;ll still be able to get jobs, but just not likely the ones with the biggest marquee names with the highest candidate:opening ratio.<p>3. If you want to do a startup, you&#x27;ll want to be in the vicinity of people who also want to do a startup. That&#x27;s much easier when you&#x27;re in college, and you get looked upon favorably if you come from a prestigious institution. Seed and angel investors like throwing cash at pairs of kids from good schools who can make something that seems useful and is in a hot space.<p>So, yes, go to college.

In particular, his Builder Pattern (item 2) has had the greatest effect. I have gotten farther in the past couple of months since discovering this book and this pattern, than in my past decade of programming. Despite this, I am still finding myself hitting the same wall: Extending classes with self-returning method-chains is at best discouraging, and at worst a nightmare--especially when generics come into play, and especially with self-referential generics, such as Comparable<T extends Comparable<T>>. As a result, I have created what I call &quot;The Blind Builder&quot;, which is a replacement for the Bloch Builder, for a very specialized situation: for use in classes that are highly-reusable, and intended for extending and sub-extending many times over. Not to say in any way that this pattern is &quot;better&quot;, just that in this particular situation it does provide some advantages. The biggest is how it decouples the to-be-built class from its builder, allowing it to be extended without having to extend its builder. Another benefit is that, aside from a single character, The Blind Builder is used in exactly the same way as the Bloch Builder. This pattern is thoroughly documented, and is presented in a question-and-answer format.",1392665831

It&#x27;s true that you&#x27;ll probably draw a good salary from a front-end development job; you&#x27;ll also keep up to date with technologies for quite some time.

I didn&#x27;t go to college myself, and\nI was in your position not too long ago, so I think I can offer some helpful advice.\nFirst of all, you don&#x27;t need to go to college to get a job as a software\ndeveloper, especially if you live in/near a tech hub (NYC, San Fran, Seattle, Austin, etc).\nHowever you&#x27;ll probably be limited to smallish startups, at least until you build\nup some professional experience. If you&#x27;re genuinely confident that you can handle\na fulltime position now, then I&#x27;d suggest just applying to companies near you\nthat you&#x27;re interested in working for. On the other hand, you could try working\nfor one or two companies as an intern over the next few months. This is what I did,\nand although it was difficult getting paid very little (or nothing) at times, it\nwas worth it  because I was able to leverage my experience for a fulltime position. Either\nway I&#x27;d suggest creating a nice resume for yourself and putting up some code on\ngithub. This will go a long way towards making you look &#x27;professional&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s true that not going to school will mean that you might miss out on some\nfundamental CS knowledge, but this doesn&#x27;t have to be the case. With wikipedia,\ngoogle, stack overflow, moocs, and online lecture notes/textbooks, you&#x27;ll have\naccess to the same knowledge as your average undergrad in a state school. With\nthe added benefit of being able to place all this information within a real-life\ncontext. You&#x27;re probably not going to learn as fast as someone immersed in a cs\ncurriculum, but you&#x27;ll be getting paid an absurd amount of money to learn this\nstuff, instead of spending the same amount of money.<p>There are some disadvantages to entering the workforce at such a young age\nthough, nothing major but I thought you should be aware:<p><pre><code>    - All the girls our age are in college. Literally all of them. It makes dating\n      very difficult.\n\n    - You&#x27;ll always be &#x27;the young guy&#x27; at work. Prepare for endless jokes about\n      your age.\n\n    - A lot of people will probably look down on you for not going to\n      college. Don&#x27;t let it get to you, these people don&#x27;t matter.\n\n    - All the girls our age are in college. Think about what this really\n      means and if you&#x27;re willing to deal with it. You&#x27;re probably not going\n      to meet girls frequently until you&#x27;re 21. I&#x27;ve repeated this twice for a reason.\n\n    - You won&#x27;t always be able to go to bars after work with coworkers.\n</code></pre>\nNonetheless, being a fulltime developer is awesome. I&#x27;ve got zero debt, I get\npaid an absurd amount of money, and I love my job. Good luck dude.<p>P.S: Learn Emacs. It&#x27;s awesome.",1392665635

Not only will it not work but it will more than likely hurt you significantly. In fact I would go as far to say the same thing about all link networks, they are a ticking time bomb that will be waiting to blow up in your face.<p>My personal suggestion for someone who is fairly new to this is to take a look at <a href=""http://pointblankseo.com/link-building-strategies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pointblankseo.com/link-building-strategies</a> for what I consider to be the most comprehensive list of link building strategies on the net.

There are LDA and STA instructions that load and store memory, addressed with a displacement and an optional accumulator (e.g. to access into a structure using a pointer).<p>It seems reasonable to assume that at some point in the mouse refresh code, we will have the mouse&#x27;s X value in one accumulator, and a pointer to the cursor structure (containing the cursor bitmap, hotspot, etc.) in another.<p>So to adjust our X value using the hotspot X from our cursor structure, we simply need an LDA to load the hotspot X into another accumulator, and an ADD or SUB to do the calculation. Repeat that for Y, and we&#x27;ve added a total of four instructions.<p>At 400,000 instructions per second, these calculations would add a 1/100,000 second overhead to the mouse calculation.<p>A worst case might be that we don&#x27;t have a free accumulator when we need it. So that would be another STA and LDA to spill one temporarily.<p>If we have to do that for both X and Y, it would put us at eight instructions total, or 1/50,000 second.<p>Still probably worth doing it to get the flexibility of custom cursor hotspots. :-)",1392664738

7253835,comment,7253501,7253501,3,0,jerf,,,"&quot;I&#x27;m also quite worried about the debt load that a degree would require. I anticipate having to take out between $50,000 and $100,000 in loans to finance a degree.&quot;<p>You may want to consider if you can do better than that. My Bachelor&#x27;s and Master&#x27;s are from Michigan State University. There is little (though not <i>quite</i> zero) evidence to suggest that there are radically better programs out there, because so much of what you get out of a college depends on <i>you</i>. (I wish I&#x27;d done better, I certainly could have done worse. But I can definitely attest that top-tier != awesome skills; I&#x27;ve given interviews that are definite counterexamples.) Double check, because some state university programs do seem to be wastes of time, but by no means all of them.<p>College is an easy, but expensive, way to acquire certain skills that, yes, will indeed future-proof your career. It is easy in that you will be guided through a useful course of study; it is expensive in that it requires not only some money, but also a lot of time.<p>One way to resolve the matter is to try your best to work with a counselor to up the quality of what courses you take. While this is poorly advertised, a degree is ultimately a certification from the certifying body that you have completed their minimal course of study. The set of requirements they lay out front is their default answer, but they can give others. While they will probably be inflexible on the number of requisite credit hours, they&#x27;re often quite flexible in terms of what those credit hours can really be, and in particular they can be quite flexible in terms of substituting harder courses for easier ones. Consider trying to skip over the intro courses, as that will particularly open up the more advanced tier earlier. Much of the real value of a college degree is in the higher level courses; if you can get there faster, go for it.<p>I&#x27;d honestly think about a dozen times about taking on $50,000-$100,000 in debt right now if that&#x27;s really the only choice you can find, though. That&#x27;s frankly catastrophic levels of debt at the beginning of a career. One nice thing about the computer career path is that you will be able to handle it, but even so it&#x27;s a burden, and if you have any sort of life hiccup this level of debt can become a big problem. I&#x27;d seriously consider grabbing a job, doing my best to pocket as much cash as possible, and wait for the post-bubble-pop to get your formal education (taking the previous paragraph even more fully to heart at that point). You may also discover that you do indeed have the discipline to pick up the harder stuff on your own. (The touchstone for that, IMHO, is whether you can teach yourself how to build a compiler; if you can do that, you can probably self-educate just fine.) It&#x27;s hard to be sure when and if the bubble will pop, so it&#x27;s a risk, but at this point, so is taking on that amount of debt. Alas, there are no non-risk choices.<p>So, no quick & easy answers. I&#x27;d be suspicious of anyone in this thread who offers one. But the question becomes much easier if you can work out a way to take on substantially less debt, though.",1392664695

Just like the United States was branded as the place where roads were paved of gold, Silicon Valley is branded as the place where dreams become reality.<p>This is powerful. It means we draw in the young, the dreamers, the motivated, the intelligent, the networkers and (generally) the doers. We drain other areas of their talent. We drain entire countries of talent. Plus we have three world class universities with stringent entrance requirements that put out huge numbers of people that were literally surrounded by peers starting companies in fields that have easy financing (berkeley - tech/cleantech/biotech, ucsf - biotech, stanford - tech/cleantech). A few National Labs (Berkeley, Livermore and SLAC) and the NASA Ames research center didn&#x27;t hurt either.<p>On top of that, we have an area where nearly everyone is a potential beta tester.

Playing around with money, having an exploratory approach to your career, risking failure - those things are just not done in Europe.",1392664396

This is completely different from the entertainment industry, which doesn&#x27;t care about part compatibility, analyst reviews (stress, aerodynamics, weights, etc.), not to mention the nature of CAD data (rife with engineering metadata on assembly hierarchies, dimensions with tolerances, materials) being very different from the &quot;looks good&quot; graphics of entertainment/art.",1392663729

That does exactly what you describe afaikt - except XMPP, its a walled garden - using NaCl.<p>Edit: I should probably elaborate:<p>- It uses the internet connection to transfer messages<p>- You can choose not to publicize your phone number and solely exchange keys via QR-codes.<p>- It uses NaCl which utilizes a permanent Diffie-Hellman key exchange to derive a symmetric key for authenticated encryption. If you can decrypt your messages, then you can forge them.<p>- There is no desktop client yet, but it is on the far agenda.<p>- It is not an open protocol.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t think XMPP is a good basis for an asynchronous, encrypted network protocol. It is extremely verbose and the extension that would make it tolerable to use with unstable internet connection and multiple clients are not supported by enough clients and servers. Also it misses an encryption standard for asynchronous communication. And again I think OTR is not a good basis for that. For example afaik there are no mechanisms for recipient key selection in a non-interactive way.<p>PS: I would greatly appreciate some markdown dialect for the Hacker News posts, if only to typeset lists.",1392663691

No is, am, are, was, were, has been, will be, etc.<p>> Of course this is overly restrictive, but 80-90% of the time there was a better way to phrase the sentence if you thought about removing the &quot;be&quot; verb. 10% of the time it was awkward, which sucked.<p>I do the same thing, habitually, as a tool to improve my writing, inspired by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime</a> .",1392663607

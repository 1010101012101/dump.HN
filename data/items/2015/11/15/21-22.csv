I have often wished that he would talk less of violence, because violence is not going to solve <i>our</i> problem... I feel that Malcolm has done himself and our people a great disservice.<p>Emphasis mine there. MLK Jr. clearly understood he and Malcolm X were aiming towards solving the same problem, but with very different approaches to it (and MLK Jr. disagreed heavily with Malcolm X&#x27;s approach clearly).<p>> From the perspective of the challangers, our status quo beliefs and approach aren&#x27;t delivering.<p>That&#x27;s a perspective of many people. Again, many people agree that problem XYZ is <i>our</i> problem. We can disagree on many other things besides that.<p>> From the perspective of many social theorists, nothing really changes until you up end the current order.<p>I suspect that&#x27;s a contentious view point. There are certainly many recent historical examples that would be evidence against that theory on both fronts: Both significant changes occurring gradually, and upheavals that ended up with results similar or worse compared to before the upheaval.<p>> As long as the status quo can sit comfortably at their desks and on their sofas, they won&#x27;t be motivated to change.<p>I assume the &quot;status quo&quot; here means the general populace, and again I think there are plenty of examples of change occurring even though the general populace wasn&#x27;t affected much.<p>Same-sex marriage in the US is a perfect example: The general populace didn&#x27;t do much other than agree that it was time to end the silly prohibition on same-sex marriage. Certainly a minority of the populace was very active in making sure that it became a reality (and vice-versa), but the general populace really didn&#x27;t do much to effect that change other than perhaps do their civic duty in voting.<p>(Even then, a small influential body unaffected by the populace had the largest effect)<p>> I&#x27;m just not going to reject them because they are disruptive to my ideas.  In fact, no matter what I end up thinking about them, it&#x27;s a good opportunity for me to re-examine my own beliefs.<p>Sure, and similarly it&#x27;s worth evaluating whether thimerosal causes autism. Might as well be safe. But once we&#x27;ve evaluated it and decided that it&#x27;s not a valid concern, it&#x27;s perfectly appropriate to reject the idea that vaccines cause autism.<p>I would further argue that it&#x27;s appropriate to be angry at those espousing the idea that vaccines do cause autism, because there are detrimental effects involved if that idea were to take hold at large.<p>My point being: Not all disruptive ideas are necessarily worth being evaluated over and over again, and some disruptive ideas are harmful and it&#x27;s appropriate to call them out as such.<p>It&#x27;s also hard to disentangle a disruptive idea from its agents, and it can also be appropriate to call out those agents acting inappropriately even if we agree with their disruptive idea (as MLK Jr. did to Malcolm X).",1447624597

10571375,comment,10569994,10569994,0,0,jerf,,,"Despite the fact this post may appear critical, this is in the spirit of feedback to a young language, not a mean spirit.<p>One of the things I&#x27;m not sure you&#x27;re looking at, and that you really ought to decide sooner rather than later, is how much interaction with Go itself you want. You very much do not want to leave the Go FFI interactions until the end.<p>In fact I daresay this is a critical decision that needs to be the next thing you really spend a lot of time thinking about, because a Kashmir that has a very poor Go FFI leaves me little reason to prefer it to Haskell, or Liskell if you want to get closer to Lisp. (Truthfully, reading over your goals & features, this sounds closer to Haskell than a Lisp, except in syntax, so I&#x27;m going to use Haskell as my benchmark.)<p>However, many of those goals and things in the type system will be at odds with having a simple Go FFI. If all functions in Kashmir are auto-curried, then Go has a hard time calling in to them, with a clumsy syntax and probably slow performance. If Kashmir&#x27;s type system ends up complicated enough that the Go type system can&#x27;t express Kashmir function types <i>at all</i>, then Go can&#x27;t call into Kashmir at all, or some complicated &quot;generic instantiation&quot; step will be required. On the other side, you have to worry about data structure compatibility, too; if Kashmir data structures don&#x27;t have a nice mapping to Go data structures then Kashmir is going to have a hard time calling into Go code.<p>Also, I&#x27;d suggest before proceeding much farther that you are very, very sure that you understand Hindley-Milner deeply, including what can break it. It offers a lot of inferring power, but at the corresponding cost of laying a lot of very specialized restrictions on your program. These carefully mathematically-specified things often have a way of breaking down the instant you put a toe outside their specified line. (The Haskell community has added things to it that have good bang/buck, but it&#x27;s always something they have to be careful about.) Go&#x27;s native type system, for instance, has one huge difference with Haskell that would have me a bit nervous, which is the difference between:<p><pre><code>    (+) :: Num a => a -> a -> a\n\n    type Num interface {\n        Add(Num, Num) Num\n    }\n</code></pre>\nHaskell&#x27;s type there guarantees all the a&#x27;s are the <i>same</i> Num type. The Num typeclass does not promise that <i>all</i> &quot;Num&quot;s can be added together, only that a Num can be added to other same type things. Go&#x27;s type system can not guarantee this; that interface in Go is promising that either A: You can hand it any two things that implement Num and it will return yet something else that implements Num which may or may not have any particular relationship to the original types or B: it will panic at runtime. (Or loop forever, I suppose, but it seems strange to be seriously discussing &quot;bottom&quot; in Go at all....)<p>Where in practice you can turn to a programmer and say &quot;Hey, obviously, it makes no sense to add a rational and a Peano integer together, and if you did, you obviously wouldn&#x27;t expect a BigInt back. So just don&#x27;t do that.&quot;, your type inferencer will not be able to make such assumptions, and if it does, you&#x27;re right back to the problem that that will raise all sorts of hell in your FFI.<p><i>These are not necessarily unsolvable problems!</i> For one thing, there&#x27;s the sort of degenerate solution of simply not permitting any FFI, and only permitting Kashmir->Go in a very restricted, stereotypical manner that requires a specialized binding step. You could also write off calling Kashmir from Go, if that helps, which is not a bad decision, but is one you should be deliberate about. But I would suggest it is deserving of being the very next issue you tackle, and spend a lot of time thinking about. Go&#x27;s type system is really, <i>really</i> weak for a static type system, in the sense of what guarantees it is capable of expressing, and trying to cozy that up to a Hindley-Milner system without giving up on a lot on one side or the other is going to be a challenge.",1447624432

I recommend the whole thing, but here are excerpts [1]<p>--------<p><i>16 April 1963<p>My Dear Fellow Clergymen:<p>While confined here in the Birmingham city jail, I came across your recent statement calling my present activities &quot;unwise and untimely.&quot; ...<p>You deplore the demonstrations taking place in Birmingham. But your statement, I am sorry to say, fails to express a similar concern for the conditions that brought about the demonstrations. ...<p>My friends, I must say to you that we have not made a single gain in civil rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure. Lamentably, it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals. ...<p>Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. ...<p>I must confess that I am not afraid of the word &quot;tension.&quot; I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal ...<p>I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro&#x27;s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen&#x27;s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to &quot;order&quot; than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: &quot;I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action&quot;; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man&#x27;s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a &quot;more convenient season.&quot; Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.</i><p>--------<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.h...</a>",1447623844

Then, with the Oil Crisis of 1973, Saudi Arabia proved its political power and was able to leverage it against the United States. When it came time to expel the Soviets from Afghanistan, <i>the United States armed the Mujahadin, a proudly Wahhabist faction</i>.<p>The US being <i>the</i> reason that ISIS has flourished is not an opinion, it&#x27;s the conclusion made over and over by analysis of historical facts.<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.cfr.org/iraq/islamic-state/p14811"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cfr.org/iraq/islamic-state/p14811</a>\n&quot;The group that calls itself the Islamic State can trace its lineage to the aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, in 2003. The Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi aligned his Jama’at al-Tawhidw’al-Jihad with al-Qaeda, making it al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI).&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.thenation.com/article/what-i-discovered-from-interviewing-isis-prisoners/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thenation.com/article/what-i-discovered-from-inte...</a>\n[1]&quot;More pertinent than Islamic theology is that there are other, much more convincing, explanations as to why they’ve fought for the side they did. At the end of the interview with the first prisoner we ask, “Do you have any questions for us?” For the first time since he came into the room he smiles—in surprise—and finally tells us what really motivated him, without any prompting. He knows there is an American in the room, and can perhaps guess, from his demeanor and his questions, that this American is ex-military, and directs his “question,” in the form of an enraged statement, straight at him. “The Americans came,” he said. “They took away Saddam, but they also took away our security. I didn’t like Saddam, we were starving then, but at least we didn’t have war. When you came here, the civil war started.”<p>ISIS is the first group since Al Qaeda to offer these young men a way to defend their dignity, family, and tribe.&quot;",1447622047

But saying that you don&#x27;t need to use it because you can write decent code is seriously not a relevant reason. The idea behind this middleware is to provide a solution that works regardless of what front-end framework you use. Sure you can do it with decent code and handle fetching data and passing it to your templates yourself, but your decent code will probably work for one single framework, and maybe for just that single application you&#x27;re working on, and it can get messy! Can you imagine now how much work and time this middleware can save you? Regarding your question about scaling, if your application can handle 200 requests per second, I think it will work just fine even when using this middleware. Expect seeing some benchmarks soon! Also, next versions will provide an option that lets you choose to render your pages only when the request is coming from a search engine bot or a social network scrapper.",1447622024

In the universities that had been closed since shortly after the beginning of the war, the students were allowed to take over, and run the administration, and later conduct the purges. This gave tremendous responsibility to people who had no qualification, no training, no life experience; and also tremendous power to people who by bribery or false testimony leveraged the system for personal gain or revenge.

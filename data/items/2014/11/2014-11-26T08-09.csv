I also went to the chapel in Houston.  It was all black (vertically rolled) with a black (horizontally rolled) swath on the bottom in a dim, concrete building.  I didn&#x27;t like the feelings of dark, gloomy, and depression they evoked;  not really what the word &quot;chapel&quot; inspires in my mind.<p>I&#x27;m not really a modern art fan, but I&#x27;ll try to keep an open mind next time I see some.  Scale, texture, subtlety, I&#x27;ll keep that in mind.  (Certainly the scale is impressive!)",1416992362

To signup, you need to use the link: www.52metrics.com/signup<p>My motivation to make it was because it is clear in research that the annual employee survey is broken. And that employees are not able to direct their issues to someone who can help them. The feedback that is taken annually becomes either insufficient or too late. Therefore the management does not get enough time to know and act upon the employee feedback.<p>In the app, I have divided the variables concerning an employee into four major parameters: management, personal growth, team and company culture. Every week, questions are sent out to the team who can answer one question a week related to any of the four parameters.<p>The questions are intentionally kept to be open ended, in order to evoke qualitative responses that can be acted upon.<p>I want to know the feedback from the community if you think this is the right way to go or any ideas that you might have.",1416992273

8661581,comment,8661387,8661533,0,0,mkaufmann,,,"Just for fun I tried to estimate the performance characteristics of this service.<p>My initial assumption is that the 2.2M pages per ~18h are the main workload. This is also supported by the chart at the bottom, outside of the 18h timespan there is hardly any baseload. The blog additionally gives the following facts: 18 c1.medium instances and ~60% utilization after the optimization (taken from the chart).<p>Now this allows us to calculate the time per page. First the time for the total workload per day is num_machines<i>(cpu_time_per_machine)=18machines</i>(18h*0.6)=194h of processing per day.<p>On page level this is than 194h/2.2M=317ms per page.<p>This feels really slow, and should even be multiplied by two to get the time per cpu core (the machines have two cpu cores)! I would guess that the underlying architecture is probably either node.js or ruby. Based on these performance characteristics the minimum cost for this kind of analysis per day is $25. For customers this means that on average the value per 1k analyzed pages should be at least $1.13. I think this is only possible with very selective and targeted scraping, given that this only includes extracting raw text/fragments from the webpages and does not include further processing.",1416992053

One minor quibble:<p>> The idea of isolation is that we want our database to be able to process several transactions at the same time (otherwise it would be terribly slow)<p>Not necessarily true. Things like Prevayler and LMAX provide isolation by processing transactions one at a time, and they&#x27;re very fast. They manage this by keeping everything relevant hot in RAM. LMAX, for example, can do 6 million TPS for a financial trading platform.

8661514,comment,8658584,8658584,0,0,jeffdavis,,,"I strongly rebut the following claim, which is central to the article:<p>&quot;Internet commenters, in their infinite wisdom, were quick to point out that if you’re dealing with money, you had better use an ACID database. But there was a major flaw in their argument. Most so-called ACID databases — for example Postgres, MySQL, Oracle or MS SQL Server — would not have prevented this race condition in their default configuration.&quot;<p>I hesitate because I don&#x27;t really understand the details of the situation the exchange faced. But, going by the linked references here:<p><a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=499580"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=499580</a>
<a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1wtbiu/how_i_stole_roughly_100_btc_from_an_exchange_and/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1wtbiu/how_i_stole_...</a><p>it appears that the pattern in question, if translated very unnaturally to SQL, is something like:<p><pre><code>    CREATE TABLE account(id int8, balance numeric);
    ...
    BEGIN;
    SELECT balance FROM account WHERE id = 123;
    -- application sees 100, subtracts 90, sees that
    -- it&#x27;s still positive and does:
    UPDATE account SET balance = 10 WHERE id = 123;
    COMMIT;
</code></pre>
Technically speaking, running that in postgres in the default configuration (read committed) is prone to a race, and you&#x27;d need to use repeatable read or serializable mode to protect you.<p>But that&#x27;s ridiculous. Anyone using SQL would instead do:<p><pre><code>    CREATE TABLE account(id int8, balance numeric, check(balance >= 0));
    ...
    UPDATE account SET balance = balance - 90 WHERE id = 123;
</code></pre>
And that is <i>not</i> prone to a race. Try it in any version of postgres, in any configuration. You can&#x27;t get double withdrawls (where only one takes effect), and you can&#x27;t get it to go below zero.<p>So, the author is <i>technically</i> right: (a) if you translate the NoSQL-isms into SQL in an unnatural way; <i>and</i> (b) don&#x27;t bother to use SERIALIZABLE mode, which costs very little in most situations.<p>I agree with the author that isolation is tricky, and developers should not be expected to understand the nuances. And I applaud the development of a testing framework to really understand the various kinds of isolation and how they apply to different products. But the example is a bad one, because it actually does work just fine in postgres, and probably many other systems.",1416989868

Marriages between Asians and whites are increasingly common; while anti-Asian bigotry exists, it is (at least among whites) much rarer than it was only one or two generations ago.

Essentially, whiteness is a malleable concept that includes or excludes different races over time. While we perhaps naively think that &quot;white&quot; is based on the color of skin or continent of origin, Mexicans, for example, of entirely Spanish (i.e. European) descent are considered non-white. But they didn&#x27;t use to - other than the Census of 1930, they were considered white in the early 20th Century. On the most recent census, 49% of Latinos checked &quot;White&quot; as their race. (Most of the rest checked &quot;other&quot;.)<p>> Jews, Italians, Irish, etc., are all races that were considered non-white (which meant English in the most restrictive use of the word) to begin with, but &quot;became white&quot; over time. In the case of the Irish, this happened when Irish people started appearing in prominent places - sports athletes, police commissioners (the Philadelphia police department had a lot of Irish in it), politicians, and so forth. With the Jews, it happened when they too moved up the social ladder, becoming one of the most educated subgroups in America (Jews have about 5 times the average number of academic professors).

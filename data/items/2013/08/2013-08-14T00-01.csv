The channel that seems to be poised to take up the mantle is FX.

6209355,comment,6205126,6205126,2,0,SimHacker,,,"Reminds me of the regrettable mistake that was E4X. I used it when developing TomTom Home on xulrunner, and its helpful &quot;blurring&quot; of XML and XMLList was no help at all, a misguided attempt to oversimplify something that just ain&#x27;t that simple. I couldn&#x27;t believe they designed it that way on purpose. It made JavaScript seem more like PHP.<p><a href=""http://www.morearty.com/blog/2007/03/13/common-e4x-pitfalls/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.morearty.com/blog/2007/03/13/common-e4x-pitfalls/</a><p>5. E4X intentionally blurs the distinction between XML and XMLList<p>When you begin to learn E4X, you learn that there are two main data types, XML and XMLList. That seems simple enough. But then after a while, you start to notice places where it seems like the wrong type is being used, or where impossible things are happening.<p>var mydocument =
  <root>
    <rabbit name=&quot;Brownster Johansson McGee&quot; />
  </root>;<p>// &#x27;mydocument.rabbit&#x27; means to get a list of ALL <rabbit>
// nodes, so myPetRabbit must be an XMLList, right?  But
// I&#x27;ll call my variable &#x27;myPetRabbit&#x27;, not &#x27;myPetRabbits&#x27;,
// because I happen to know that I have only one pet
// rabbit.<p>var myPetRabbit:XMLList = mydocument.rabbit;<p>// What&#x27;s her name?  Hey wait a minute, &quot;her&quot; name?
// Why does this next line work?  Isn&#x27;t myPetRabbit an XMLList?
// What does it mean to get an attribute of a list??<p>trace(myPetRabbit.@name);<p>The reason this works is that E4X intentionally blurs the distinction between XML and XMLList. Any XMLList that contains exactly one element can be treated as if it were an XML. (Furthermore, in this example, even if myPetRabbit held a list of more than one node, myPetRabbit.@name is still a legal expression; it simply returns a list of all name attribute nodes of all of those elements.)<p>In fact, if you search the E4X spec (PDF) for blur, you will find 15 usages of the phrase  intentionally blurs the distinction between.<p>For example, another place where this blurring is evident is in the behavior of XMLList.toString(). As the Flex docs say:<p>If the XML object has simple content, toString() returns the string contents of the XML object with the following stripped out: the start tag, attributes, namespace declarations, and end tag.<p>If the XML object has complex content, toString() returns an XML encoded string representing the entire XML object, including the start tag, attributes, namespace declarations, and end tag.<p>So if an XMLList contains <node>hello</node>, then toString() will return &quot;hello&quot;; but if the list contains <node>hello</node><node>goodbye</node>, then toString() will return &quot;<node>hello</node><node>goodbye</node>&quot; (not &quot;hellogoodbye&quot;). Presumably this decision was made in an effort to achieve do what I mean behavior, where the output would match what developers most often intended; but personally I find it a little confusing. If you really need the full XML version of an XMLList that contains simple content, use toXMLString() instead of toString().",1376441854

  3) The continuously increasing trend of introducing &#x27;non standard&#x27; features,

  4) The growing need to &#x27;write around&#x27; correct/valid code that GCC will not 
     compile.

     someone who has been working with GCC internals for &quot;forever&quot; --a decade

I&#x27;m not sure you read the same report I did.<p><i>MIT in fact began the prosecution through contacting law enforcement</i><p>Local law enforcement, yes--because, as the report notes, they did not have the in-house expertise to figure out what was going on. MIT did <i>not</i> call in the Secret Service; local law enforcement did. And calling law enforcement to help figure out who is using your network in a way you didn&#x27;t expect is not the same as beginning a prosecution.<p><i>conducted a sting operation by videotaping the wiring cabinet</i><p>The cabinet, the room it was in, and the network as a whole were MIT&#x27;s property. Would you call it a &quot;sting operation&quot; if you put a video camera in your house to figure out who was trying to hook up to your home network?<p><i>and most importantly, at every turn chose to escalate the situation rather than see the incident for what it was: a petty experiment.</i><p>I strongly disagree with this characterization, and I don&#x27;t think the report supports it.<p><i>They could have chosen to block his access</i><p>They did, several times. Each time he changed tactics to circumvent the blockage.<p><i>or approached him privately</i><p>They couldn&#x27;t, because they didn&#x27;t know whom to approach. Swartz was not identified until he was arrested, and even then MIT did not identify him; the Cambridge police did.<p><i>Instead they chose to hand him over to a US attorney&#x27;s office for prosecution</i><p>They did no such thing. You are twisting the facts.<p><i>I said that I don&#x27;t trust any internal investigation which exonerates the institution that conducted the investigation.</i><p>First of all, as I said before, the report does not &quot;exonerate&quot; MIT. But let&#x27;s assume for the sake of argument that we are looking at a report by an institution concerning its own conduct which <i>does</i> exonerate it, in all respects.<p>Second, even on that assumption, what you say here amounts to the same thing I said before: you don&#x27;t think any institution can police itself. You are basically assuming that, if an investigation is ever started at all, there must have been some wrongdoing, so if the institution doesn&#x27;t find any wrongdoing, it must be a whitewash. That&#x27;s equivalent to saying that no institution can ever police itself. (It&#x27;s also wrong, in my opinion; investigations can perfectly legitimately find that no wrongdoing took place.)<p><i>Before he spoke to a single witness, weighed a single piece of evidence, examined a single record, or interviewed a single expert he stated that he expected to find no deviation from policy. That is not the statement of a fair or unbiased investigator.</i><p>I&#x27;m not judging the report by statements made beforehand. I&#x27;m judging it on its own merits. I don&#x27;t think you are doing likewise.<p><i>Note the broad claims to protecting employee &quot;privacy&quot;</i><p>No, the claims aren&#x27;t broad, because they specifically say &quot;employee privacy&quot;. They do <i>not</i> say, as you implied they did, &quot;anything in which MIT has a privacy interest&quot;. That would indeed be very broad, but that&#x27;s not what MIT requested.<p><i>No, nor would they receive it.</i><p>Hollow laugh. You have a much greater faith than I do in the public&#x27;s ability to consider such things rationally, particularly when the public is being inflamed by rhetoric about how the government is being draconian and MIT is aiding and abetting it.",1376440064

It does not say that MIT made no mistakes.<p>Once again, have you actually read the report? If not, you should do so instead of relying on biased second-hand accounts.&quot;<p>Yes, I have read the report in detail. To comment without doing so would be irresponsible.<p>In particular, the portion I, as well as many others including Aaron Swartz&#x27;s father, take issue with is the section beginning on page 52 entitled &quot;MIT adopts and maintains a posture of neutrality.&quot;<p>MIT in fact began the prosecution through contacting law enforcement, conducted a sting operation by videotaping the wiring cabinet, and most importantly, at every turn chose to escalate the situation rather than see the incident for what it was: a petty experiment. They could have chosen to block his access, or approached him privately. Instead they chose to hand him over to a US attorney&#x27;s office for prosecution under laws they knew or should have known to be draconian.<p>>&quot;In other words, you don&#x27;t think any institution can ever police itself.&quot;<p>That is emphatically not what I said, nor is it an accurate restatement.<p>I said that I don&#x27;t trust any internal investigation which exonerates the institution that conducted the investigation. Prof. Abelson began his investigation by stating, &quot;The review will not be a witch-hunt or an attempt to lay blame on individuals. We don’t know what we’ll find as the answers unfold, but I expect to find that every person acted in accordance with MIT policy.&quot;<p>Before he spoke to a single witness, weighed a single piece of evidence, examined a single record, or interviewed a single expert he stated that he expected to find no deviation from policy. That is not the statement of a fair or unbiased investigator.<p>I place no more stock in his investigation than I would a JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs &quot;investigation&quot; that concluded that they played no role in the mortgage crisis.<p>Twisting my words to argue against a strawman is facile and does not further the cause of informed debate.<p>>&quot;Source, please?&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/729140-mit-motion-to-intervene.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/729140-mit-motion-to-...</a><p>Note the broad claims to protecting employee &quot;privacy.&quot; This is about more than redacting a few names, not least because FOIA requires that the names of third parties be redacted anyway.<p>If redacting names is a requirement of the law, why would MIT need an invented &quot;pre-screening&quot; procedure to ensure names were redacted? The answer is, of course, that they wouldn&#x27;t.<p>Never have I seen a private institution intervene in a FOIA request in this manner. This intervention had precisely nothing to do with protecting the privacy of employees, and everything to do with establishing a legal avenue to conceal information MIT found embarrassing.<p>>&quot;I see no reason why those who participated in these terrible events should be shielded from public opprobrium\n>>Even if they were acting reasonably? For example, take the MIT network engineers who noticed the unusual activity and reported it, helped to discover where it was coming from (as in, what device was producing it--the laptop), but had no further part in the proceedings. They are named in the documents. Do they deserve public opprobrium?&quot;<p>No, nor would they receive it.

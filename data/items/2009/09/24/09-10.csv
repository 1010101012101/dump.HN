The loose right-angle weave of the coarse fibers means that it has zero shear strength on the most common axes, and is prone to splitting when under tension. The outer vinyl layer will separate on its own in heat, leaving a mess of fibers + adhesive behind.<p>WD-40 combines a solvent, a mild lubricant, and an adhesive (!) -- it's extremely prone to collecting grit and caking it onto surfaces. It will displace any better lubricant it is applied onto.",1253786368
840886,comment,840883,840883,0,0,simonw,,,"I get pretty annoyed when I see people dismissing client-side engineering as being somehow less challenging than server-side development - on the server, you only have to get it working on one platform (and for all but the most high traffic sites you can write code as badly as you like without much penalty). Client-side engineers have 5 different rendering engines to deal with, need to think about performance, accessibility, resizing, legibility... and that's before you even get to the huge domain that is modern JavaScript.",1253786060

The remaining programmers use tests to ensure what they have done works, and also hasn’t broken something else.<p>So given the fact that most people work in teams of programmers of varied skill levels, it makes sense to write tests.

Things that other people might argue are important might not <i>seem</i> that important to you, given whatever perspective you have at the time.

840856,comment,840802,840802,0,0,shiro,,,"> Consultants usually earn more money the longer a project takes, and their income is not tied to the yields of the project.<p>Well... that seems oversimplification.  When I consult, I ask the price roughly based on the estimation of how much time I'm going to take, but ultimately it is the matter that how much value the client sees in the outcome.  Note that the expected outcome and the price are agreed beforehand---if I bump into an unforeseen obstacle and take twice time as my estimation, I can't ask them twice price; basically the more I work, the less I make per hour.<p>So (1) I have a very strong incentive to make sure my part works in time, and (2) There's less incentive to finish the work earlier than the initial estimation.    Thus I tend to put effort to write tests and debugging aids within the time frame (or, in other words, I try to negotiate initial time frame including those tests).<p>Certainly there's a different pressure on employees; they may adjust priorities and time frames more frequently.<p>So, it is true that consultants make more money the longer the project takes, but the incentive is in making sure it won't take longer than expected, rather than making it take longer deliberately.  (After all, if the consultant is doing ok, there are projects in waiting list so it's not much point to taking one project longer than necessary.)",1253783725
840855,comment,840702,840779,0,0,psyklic,,,"The key is not to find ""who gets HIV"" vs. ""who does not get HIV."" Instead, we are trying to measure ""who gets exposed"" vs. ""who gets HIV."" Although we do not know how many people are <i>exposed</i> in each group, we can make sure that the number of exposed people in each group is approximately the same by increasing the number of people vaccinated. If we know that the same number of people are exposed (which is less than the sample size), then the number of people who get sick is much more significant.<p>By increasing the number of vaccinated people, the number of exposed people becomes more equal between the two groups since a few ""more exposed/risky people were assigned to group A"" will have a less significant impact.",1253783593
840854,comment,840523,840730,0,0,tezza,,,"Amen,<p>It's nice to hear someone with experience from before the ""Unit Test is compulsory"" explosion. Programmers should always test their work, but testing comes in much more of a diverse range than mere Unit Tests.<p>There are plenty of cases where Unit Testing is 'embarrasingly'[1] appropriate. These pin-up applications blinds Testing advocates to the fact that Unit Tests are often inferior to other methods or simply not possible.<p>An example where completely automated tests are impossible is PDF generation. One cannnot 'Unit Test' this. One has to build a framework to take test data, create less than 100 pdfs, and then a human has to eyeball it. Humans cannot eyeball more than 100 images and perceive subtle errors. Less than 100 output images means this cannot exercise every codepath of even simple applications.<p>Often I was working on a part of the Render Pipeline which was not currently exercised by the existing test. Do I create a whole new test suite to generate test images for each branch condition? If it is important, yes, I created a new end-to-end test. But if it was not, then I addapted some existing test input and used my best judgement and my knoweldge of the internal state. This test did not last beyond my short-term memory, and my own set of eyeballs. If a problem occured later, I would recreate the test from memory.<p>This is still TDD, but it is so much less straight-jacket than requiring Automated-testing. The tests are 'thrown away' effectively. But the tested code remains. I would also say that the coder knowing which portions to test is superior in many cases.<p>--------------<p>[1] Similar to :: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel</a> .

9641257,comment,9639055,9641129,0,0,vdnkh,,,"In the same interview I wrote about in this thread, I also had a computer question. Had an hour to complete it. I knew the answer from the outset, and just had to work out a few details (was working in Mono for the first time). And you know what? It took took me the whole hour. My solution worked great, but it wasn&#x27;t my best code. I didn&#x27;t leverage OOP enough and made it too procedural. On a whiteboard this would be fine; logic is really the only grading factor. But on the computer, you don&#x27;t really have much more time <i>but your answer has to be so much better</i>. And the way it was done for me, I was alone on the computer, not able to give any rationale for my code. And when they reviewed it, they probably ripped it a new one without knowing why I did what I did. I could have easily explained why I made each choice and how to make it better. In the best case, a computer question would be much better. But done sloppily, it&#x27;s pretty unfair.

9641256,comment,9637417,9640840,0,0,peeters,,,"It&#x27;s fairly difficult.  Sending a player down means exposing him to waivers (meaning another team can claim his contract).  Now, that might be good in some circumstances, but in general you don&#x27;t want to lose a player with no compensation.  The highest player contracts also have clauses which can prevent being moved or traded (i.e. the player would have to agree being sent to the minors).<p>One tool they can use is the Injured Reserve, which allows GMs to backfill a long-term injury with players of equal or lesser value without contributing to the cap.  This is what the Leafs&#x27; GM Nonis used to free up cap space by trading Clarkson to the Blue Jackets for Nathan Horton, for example.  And even then Clarkson had to waive his no-trade clause (which he was classy enough to do).",1433185192

In fact it stands for Document Object <i>Model</i> :P I know it&#x27;s confusing since it&#x27;s where you create the view for <i>your app</i>, but the DOM is actually a model of <i>your</i> view (i.e. the <i>V</i> on your app&#x27;s MVC is built manipulating the <i>M</i> on the browser&#x27;s MVC).<p>Why can&#x27;t the web draw at 100 FPS from immutable data? Because the web renders through constraints based on the DOM, and constraints cascade, which is a problem more akin to physics in games (which are mutable for a reason) than their graphics. The bottleneck is updating such model.<p>Also, game physics constraints are usually faster to calculate because action at a distance is unusual and there are optimizations like quad-trees. In web pages, inserting a single DOM node can trigger a huge change, making it more like simulating hydrodynamics that the common solids found in videogames.",1433185124

Chess is purely mental and has many similar parallels to programming.<p>I&#x27;ve met hundreds of chess players who have been playing chess for <i>years</i>, logging thousands of games. Many of them study the game on a regular basis and attend tournaments, and they all have ratings.<p>A beginner chess player starts with a provisional rating of 1200, which goes up or down depending on wins or losses logged over time. Grand masters are players that have earned a rating of at least 2600 or higher.<p>For every chess grand master out there (think of them as a 10x or even 100x producer), there are thousands of chess players that have been slogging away for years without their ratings improving past even 1500. They are simply blocked by their lack of natural talent, no matter how much they study or practice.<p>This is a fact that is objectively measurable and is backed up by millions of data points from officially rated chess games.<p>There&#x27;s no reason why the same laws of nature related to raw mental talent (specifically problem solving and memorization) wouldn&#x27;t also apply to programmers.",1433184887

I went with the facts before the Court, which are the only facts relevant to making a legal determination.  Neither this Court nor a court of appeals is going to look at anything else due to the rules of evidence.  Moreover, unless he&#x27;s already raised the issue of entrapment (and I don&#x27;t think he has), it&#x27;s almost certainly been waived and cannot be raised on appeal.  You can personally believe that the facts presented in court are wrong, if you prefer, but they&#x27;re not relevant to a legal analysis.  Making a non-legal analysis of whether it&#x27;s &quot;entrapment&quot; makes zero sense--entrapment is a legal concept and divorcing the notion of entrapment from how a court would determine something is entrapment is insensible.  It doesn&#x27;t answer any real-world questions and it would serve only to mislead, as courts follow rules to determine things like these.<p>To establish entrapment, you need to locate some place in which he demonstrated some resistance to hiring a hitman, I was unable to find any such evidence in materials before the Court.  If you think otherwise, quote anything you like from his log or any other evidence before the Court that shows him being averse to hiring a hitman until they talked him into it.<p>Without that, you don&#x27;t get to claim entrapment, legally.  The Court would just say you were already predisposed to commit the crime and ignore your protests about how the cops fooled you, as is shown repeatedly in the law guide.  Moreover, the burden of proof is on you to establish entrapment, not the other way around.  So it&#x27;s not enough to say that but for the theft/blackmail he wouldn&#x27;t have done this, you have to show him resisting the idea.<p>Was he set up by the cops?  Undoubtedly so.  Every single example in the law guide of non-entrapment shows the cops setting someone up.  But there are standards for entrapment which must be met by evidence properly presented in court.  If his lawyers do not make this argument, it is because they cannot.  If someone suggests that &quot;hey, you should hire this guy to kill that guy who&#x27;s causing you problems,&quot; you will be in legal trouble if you go along with their suggestion instead of refusing it.<p>So &#x27;charitable&#x27; has nothing to do with it.  The evidence before the Court isn&#x27;t very charitable to him.  You might argue that this is unfair, but this is how you determine something like entrapment.  That&#x27;s why there are long fights over the evidence (like the one I linked earlier), because that determines what they have to work with.",1433184514

Our mission is to build a must-have messaging platform for modern marketers or growth hackers to engage with their users. Customers that rely us for messaging include Yelp, BetterDoctor and MemeBox.<p>We previously worked at Twitter/Google, and we noticed that every one of these high growth companies would rebuild the same tools and abstractions internally to drive growth. They&#x27;d organize some people into a growth team, build software to orchestrate email, push, and prompt messaging, and run experiments.<p>We&#x27;ve built that ourselves to make those abstractions available to everyone.<p>There are a lot of interesting challenges in engineering the software - here are a few!<p><pre><code>  - Scale our messaging API 
  - Design and write performant, beautiful, asynchronous interfaces 
  - Build integrations with leading messaging platforms: Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Line
  - Built our content recommendation service
  - Make data visualizations for our email and user data 
  - Design an immutable deployment infrastructure for our platform
</code></pre>
I&#x27;d also really pinpoint our culture. We&#x27;re all friends and have fun at work. (I know everyone says that, but that social culture is something we missed at larger companies/startups, so it&#x27;s something we focus on having at Iterable)
Some aspects of our culture that make us different:<p><pre><code>  - Our company has egalitarian and transparent values (work when you want, on what you want) 
  - We are chill and empathetic people 
  - The company is completely transparent

  - Postgres
  - Redis
  - AngularJS
  - Play Framework
  - RabbitMQ

This happens a lot in embedded systems.  Another scenario is web development where you need to interact with an API a bit before you can really understand how to work with it.<p>So I am not proposing not coding at all.

However, it&#x27;s normal that a given drug won&#x27;t affect everyone in the same way.<p>I&#x27;ve had pure MDMA several times (tested). I&#x27;ve supplemented with 5-HTP and antioxidants, made sure to eat, and even then I&#x27;ve often had issues where it left me depressed and anxious for days afterwards. My friends, who never supplement, do not experience such a crash. At this point, I generally avoid MDMA because the crash is too painful to be worth it.<p>I&#x27;ve recently had my genes sequenced and found out that I have a slow variant of the TPH2 gene. This gene encodes for the enzyme (tryptophan hydroxylase) which makes serotonin. It&#x27;s normal that I have more aftereffects after MDMA use, because my brain is probably 2-5x slower at replenishing serotonin. No amount of supplementation will fix this, because tryptophan hydroxylase is the bottleneck.<p>Brains are more unique than faces.

9640947,comment,9638066,9638066,0,0,drostie,,,"So the basic math here looks like this: in classical probability theory, when you&#x27;ve got multiple random variables `X, Y` they have a joint probability `f(x, y)` such that the probability that (X, Y) is in the square (x ± dx/2, y ± dy/2) is `f(x, y) dx dy`. Independent distributions have probabilities which factor: `f(x, y) = g(x) * h(y)`, to fit the general rule that independent discrete events have probabilities which multiply. To calculate probabilities for a function like `Z = X + Y` you have to invent a new probability-distribution function `p(z) = ∫ f(x, z - x) dx`, which for independent events appears as a <i>convolution</i> of the two probability-densities.<p>All of the useful statistics for a probability distribution can be gleaned from the probability-density function by taking the Fourier transform and then (when it&#x27;s not too bad) the (complex) natural logarithm -- or, when it&#x27;s easier, just `f(s) = log(E[exp(s X)])` (having `s X` rather than `i s X` up-top). These are called <i>cumulant-generating functions</i> or CGFs.<p>If you have a sum of two independent random variables, the CGF of the sum is the sum of their CGFs. This means that the Taylor polynomial of the CGFs have components which simply add together. Take derivatives of the CGF to get the &quot;cumulants&quot;, which are pseudo-linear (linear in independent random variables, with some relationship `f(k X) = k^n f(X)`). So these cumulants become really convenient for characterizing the distribution as a whole: in fact if you have all of them you can recover the original distribution.<p>Now if you describe your distributions in terms of its cumulants, you now have a special monoid:<p><pre><code>    data Distr n = Distr [n]
    instance (Num n) => Monoid (Distr n) where
        mempty = Distr (repeat 0)
        mappend = zipWith (+)
</code></pre>
Gaussian distributions in particular have a <i>form</i> for their CGF which is preserved by this monoid operation, namely:<p><pre><code>    if X ~ Gauss(m, s^2) then ln(E(exp(k X))) = m k + s^2 k^2
</code></pre>
(Note that the leading term has to be 0, as if s = 0 we have ln(E(1)) = ln(1) = 0.) Another way to state this is &quot;the Fourier transform of a Gaussian is another Gaussian.&quot;<p>So that is super-simple, and you can already see the hints of the central limit theorem emerging: the mean of N identically-distributed variables X_i will have a CGF related to the coefficients c_i of the original distribution by:<p><pre><code>    ln(E(k * sum_i X_i / N)) = N sum_m c_m k^m / N^m
</code></pre>
so the Taylor expansion gets attenuated by successive powers of N: you can approximate the CGF with truncation.<p>So, the set of all distributions form a monoid under convolution if you allow the Dirac delta-function to act as `mempty` -- in a certain representation, this appears as the termwise-summing monoid. Gaussian distributions are a sub-monoid of this larger monoid, and they are not the only one: we could easily go out to 3, 4, or 5 cumulants before setting the rest to 0 and finding a similar sub-family.",1433183178

It&#x27;s far too easy, and sometimes fun, to build better/more features than the competition. It&#x27;s equally difficult for the sales department (and me at times!) to say &quot;no&quot; to new feature requests from potential customers.<p>Conversely, the work to deep dive in to customer usage metrics that tell the story of how users use the app and reach their &quot;Aha!&quot; moment is comparatively dry and time consuming but nonetheless essential. We&#x27;ve set up a number of KPI reports which tell a detailed story of where our triallists and paying customers spend their time in the app and extract value.<p>We use a combination of Google Analytics and custom KPI reporting to watch customers use the app. We&#x27;ve tried 3rd party apps, like Intercom and Mixpanel but keep returning to google analytics.<p>So the good news is that we&#x27;ve identified key KPIs that tell us how likely a trial is to convert. For example, we know that a triallist that has logged in more than x times is > 90% likely to upgrade to paying. This is powerful, as we don&#x27;t invest time attempting to sell to these. Likewise, we now automatically filter out customers that are not at all engaged with the app, and aim to sell to just those that sit between the two extremes. We&#x27;ve also taken the time to customise life cycle e-mails to triallists according to their levels of engagement. Again, very time consuming work but essential and very rewarding when the results are positive (more no/low touch upgrades = more £&#x27;s).<p>Obviously all traillists regardless of engagement level get top notch support. However I&#x27;m sure more sales intelligence could be shared with the support team as they&#x27;re also key to the selling cycle, albeit in a more reactive manner. Support also need to feedback to the onboarding team, as support are front line for people who get stuck and frustrated as a result during a trial.<p>I could talk at length on this subject, conversion rate optimisation is something enjoy and definitely don&#x27;t spend as much time as I would like actively working on...",1433182738

If you want a dropdown that functions exactly the way Ext made a dropdown it is the easiest thing in the world, but if you want a slightly different behavior then it&#x27;s a whole rigamarole of events and overrides and stuff. It&#x27;s not just how it looks but actual functionality that is hard to improve. You&#x27;d be frightened if you saw our &quot;ExtOverride.js&quot; file. :)<p>I should have also caveat-ed that we are on ExtJS 3, so ymmv with 4.<p>The way you&#x27;ve concisely written the Ext code and long-form written out the React code does show some form of bias, as what you&#x27;re really doing with React is pretty much the same as how you&#x27;ve written the Ext code, but if you write out the full path of any kind of UI update it will seem more complex. I mean, adding &quot;the store  is notified that something changed and redraws itself to show the loading mask/spinner&quot; is what, 2 lines of code? But a long-form explanation makes it seem like a bigger deal.<p>Your Ext code is missing all the logic to actually set up the Ajax stuff, all the event handling that you call out in React, error handling, etc... If you came into a React system with all the same things set up that you&#x27;re assuming in your Ext system (data bindings, event handling, visual components) then the code to accomplish the same thing looks almost identical.<p>As I said, Ext is great if you want to do what Ext wants you to do. It magics away a lot of stuff that you have to call out explicitly with React+Flux. But the second something goes wrong or you want to try something else that magic bites you in the ass.<p>All I can say is that my experience switching from Ext to React has been one of massive amounts of time wasted figuring out the quirk of event flows and component layout hierarchies to front-end code that just makes sense and does what you&#x27;d expect and is ridiculously simple to debug.",1433182661

Is it always worth the extra overhead to enforce everything being blocked scoped? What about times that we needed to alter something outside the scope? whether  or not thats always a good idea is another discussion but there are valid uses. I remember people were getting all worked up over functional expressions vs declarations saying expressions were &#x27;the one true way&#x27; since it more closely resemebles how the compiler reads it.

If I ever find a computer running Windows XP, I always offer and implore the owner (assuming they are not dependent on some software that has no Linux surrogate) to let me throw Lubuntu 14.04 on the thing. I do it for free, and offer up to three hours of tutoring also for free, because Windows XP is literally cancer. Its a tumor you don&#x27;t know is there until it goes malignant and kills you by having some unpublished never to be patched exploit used to wreck your PC and steal all your personal information or lock you out. Its more unsafe than unprotected sex in a sleazy strip club.<p>Feature wise, Lubuntu matches pretty much perfectly, and even people still using XP often have Android phones, so the Lubuntu software center makes a lot more sense to people than have Play Store experience. Its not like anyone using these computers needs performance out of them - if they were trying to run a business or do anything intensive enough to require proprietary Windows only software they would have certainly updated the machine once in the last decade. They almost always are exclusively doing word processing and email, often not even web browsing because these are systems stuck with IE8 at best.

Remember, the whole &quot;expectation of privacy&quot; is a &quot;living Constitution&quot; bolt-on. What the 4th amendment&#x27;s text actually lays out is basically a protection against what would be trespass if done by a private person: <a href=""http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/amendments/4/essays/144/searches-and-seizures"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/amendments/4/essays/...</a>.

There&#x27;s another 80 years of adult life after that, and the rate of consumption only increases (especially if they themselves have children etc).  I think your key error here is counting unproductivity of the pets as an issue: from the perspective of resource consumption, that&#x27;s not a bad thing.<p>This may sound like a pedantic complaint about your point, but the fact of the matter is that the average DINK couple who decides not to have kids is going to be using massively less resources, despite having a lavish lifestyle as a substitute.

There&#x27;s radical differences made in how frontend applications are developed with React, and the primary selling point that I kept hearing was &quot;embrace it, the performance difference is HUGE!&quot;.  Then as arguments come out about how the performance differences have caveats, the arguments switch to &quot;...well this is how we should be developing, for X, Y, and Z architectural reasons&quot;.

All that matters is someone died. People&#x27;s birth and death years are fungible, in a sense. Each birth increases the population by one and each death increases the population by one.<p>Basically, you&#x27;ll create an array where the value at each index represents how much the population <i>changed</i> in that year (steps 1 to 3). Then you can use that array to find the highest population (step 4).<p>1. Get the min birth year and the max birth year.<p>2. Create an array where the size is the above range. Set to all zeros. Each index will map to / represent a year in the range.<p>3. Loop through all the people. For each person, increment the index of their birth year and decrement their death year (or the following year, depending on whether or not they&#x27;re counted as alive the entire year of their death)<p>4. Just loop through the array, tracking the running sum at each index.

The complexity of the process and method fascinated me, and while I like to think I was following along okay, I&#x27;m not bold enough to jump out and say I grasp it.<p>2 - I guess there&#x27;s a bit of a language difference in the title here (extracting) versus the dominant term used in the article (recovering).

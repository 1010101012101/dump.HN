What people SHOULD be concerned about is the higher rate of click fraud on adsense ads (publishers have a vested interest in getting people to click on their ads).  They should also be concerned about the gray area of ""ad confusion"" - designing an adsense site in such a way that the ads seem less like ads and more like normal site navigation.<p>I'd avoid the Adsense publishing network altogether.",1181854071

28197,comment,28176,28176,0,0,cwilbur,,,"The core of your business should be in-house.  If the technology sits at the core of your business -- as it does for most web companies -- then outsourcing it is foolish.  If your business is actually something else, like plumbing, and the tech just supports it, then you may as well outsource it; it's a decision for a cost-benefit analysis.",1181853651
28196,comment,28150,28150,0,0,Mistone,,,"i think if yc startups are being set up by lawyers vs. incorp service than you might consider going that route.  
There are a ton of variables involved for each situation, but if your going for the angel to VC path, paying for a lawyer with experience in web/tech startup financing is a good idea.<p>Many top law firms will defer the fees, and it looks good to an investor when you have decent lawyer backing you up.

I'm the TrackSuit CEO, the first company I started is EmployeeInsider, an online job rating forum for all industries.  I'll write more about it later (tomorrow?).  I've since run several businesses.  I do SEO contracting and most recently I've done marketing through one of my companies for ridester.com
Thanks for the comment!",1181852063
28190,comment,28150,28163,0,0,webwright,,,"FWIW, I've sold two LLCs (one to private buyers and one two a VC backed dotcom).  Worked fine.  Both had sub ~$500 in legal setup fees.<p>As you say, it's easy to move from LLC to C.  Start it easy and quick (but do your trademark homework) and see if you can build a successful product.  Statistically speaking, you probably can't, in which case you haven't wasted dollars on lawyers.<p>If you start to feel like your product is taking off (or has potential to), get off your butt and invest in some real legal help to get your ducks in a row.<p>Of course, if YC will help you do it right out of the gates-- that's dandy.",1181851581

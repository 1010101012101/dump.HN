312825,comment,312581,312713,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"The iPhone doesn't lose luster when it acquires imitators. Far from it. The release of Android is a big, free benefit for Apple's marketing.<p>The release of Android will inspire approximately 3e5 articles comparing the new phone with existing phones. And which is the existing phone that will be featured in every single one of those articles, cast (once again) in the role of <i>the current gold standard for smart phones</i>? It'll be the iPhone. Because stories with Apple in them are exciting stories. And because, from the market's perspective, Android is an obvious derivative of the iPhone -- except for the parts that are derivative of the Blackberry instead, like the hardware keyboard. (If RIM is lucky they might rate a mention in the fifth paragraph of these articles.)<p>There will now be a big P.R. effort to define the entire smartphone industry as an epic battle between iPhone and Android. Which can only benefit <i>both</i> platforms, because the amount of downside to losing a bit of marketshare to your direct competitor is more than compensated by the enormous potential <i>upside</i> of growing the entire iPhone/Android niche of the industry. Remember, iPhone may be a hugely successful product, but it's still only a tiny percentage of the installed base of phones. There's a lot of potential customers still out there. Customers that might be drawn in now that they have a <i>range</i> of iPhone-like devices to choose from.<p>The only way that Android would be a terrible blow to Apple is if it clearly and <i>obviously</i> kicked the iPhone's butt. But it doesn't. There will be a lot of little details that will lead some people to prefer one phone over the other, but there's nothing game-changing here that would cause me to abandon the iPhone. The big difference that folks here on HN notice is the openness of the software platform, but that might not actually be a competitive advantage -- and, if it <i>does</i> prove to be a huge competitive advantage, it won't be one for long, because Apple could eliminate it in <i>fifteen minutes</i> if they really wanted to. All it takes is a policy change.",1222203536

They've managed to find a great synergy between selling their ""real"" product and their marketing - which includes their blog, conferences, the ""37signals way"" - and they are talking about selling the byproducts of their marketing.<p>My point is that this isn't necessarily always a great strategy.

If I founded a YC Company, or any other startup, I'd look at Omnisio's story and think about duplicating it.""<p>I'm not saying I don't envy Omnisio's trajectory, but YC (and any other investor) has a vested interest in investing in companies that DON'T follow this path.  They want empire builders, not build-to-flip folks.  Not that Omnisio built with that in mind-- I heard them talking about a lot of long-term stuff, so I'm pretty sure they were building for the long term and just got a great early offer.<p>""It's just so incredibly important to take money from people are in the position to help you reach liquidation (if that is what you want).""<p>I've heard many times that companies get bought-- they don't get sold.

312814,comment,311815,312799,0,0,DaniFong,,,"That's not true; many parents have misgivings about putting their children in situations likely to harm their body (gymnastics, or football, or hockey, or extreme sports), or despair of other parents injecting children with growth hormones or steriods or pumping them full of creatine. Many adults are wary of those around them doing amphetamines or cocaine. Many women worry enormously (and hence avoid) potential health effects of HRT or the birth control pill, as it is associated with many reproductive cancers among other diseases. Many men avoid steroids and testosterone; it causes problems with the heart and circulatory systems, and it can make you bald.<p>Surely the <i>magnitude</i> of fear people feel with regard to drugs versus activities is higher. This is probably instinctive: they are a lot of things one can have put into one's body, and throughout evolution, most were pretty bad. But the drugs and training regimens and lifestyles are not in principle distinct. To the extent we can have equally complete knowledge of their effects (which we probably can't), we should judge them the same.",1222202857
312813,comment,312496,312496,0,0,larrykubin,,,"Nice. I was thinking about a similar idea recently (judging from the other sites that have been posted, many have had this idea). I wanted to focus on specific games though. If you go to a forum for a college football team, such as buckeyeplanet.com, hornfans.com, or texags.com, you will notice that for each game they create a ""Game Thread"". I wanted to build a system for gamethreads, since using phpBB, vBulletin, and other forum software doesn't seem to be the best solution for a series of one sentence commentaries on what is happening in the game. If you could nail down this feature and promote it on message boards for each team, I'm sure people would use it. I think many message boards have trouble managing the volume of traffic and small posts on game day. Good work!",1222202771

'Safe' is obviously a relative term. How safe do we need?<p>We have very incomplete understanding of cellular and molecular biology (much less than, for example, the circulation system, which the glove uses). Where harm can be potentially averted by the use of drugs for medicine, it makes sense. But where harm can be potentially caused by the use of drugs for recreational activity (of which sports are an example), things seem much more morally ambiguous.<p>You have to draw a line somewhere. At some point, the increased risk is simply too much to ignore. And when you have a highly competitive situation like professional sports, it is, I argue, <i>immoral</i> to tempt people, by competition, into doing something potentially harmful to themselves. Voluntary recreational drugs are one thing, but in competitive sports, I argue that we should try to keep training methods and substances as safe as possible.

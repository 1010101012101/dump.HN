I was going to submit this here but I didn't remember my login password, and to my surprise, discovered there was no way to get a password reminder from the site. So I posted it to reddit instead. Now I found my password, but it was late: the link was posted here too, already :)<p>I think Hacker News needs: password reminders, and an option for changing passwords.",1193410603

I have learned so much from my network that I think I would have just kept failing with out them.<p>Every entrepreneur I have meet is available for lunch or dinner once or twice.<p>You're business school might know some local entrepreneur's and might be willing to make an introduction.  There are also local professional groups that should have networking events for you to meet other local entrepreneurs.<p>And, finally just have fun, entrepreneurs can be found just about anywhere, the race track, your local movie festival, Great America, and even you're local bartender.<p>",1193409375

Don't let anyone go in over $1,000(two semesters of books), and you should just ride it out.<p>In all likelihood you will not succeed, but do not take that as a reason not to give it a try.  I learned so much from my college projects that sounded very similar to your situation.<p>And last of all remember that if you were able to come up with one good idea, there will be more, you are young and have decades of life in front of you.<p>Get out there and run full speed with this team, do the best you can to make a go of it, and you might find your self succeeding.  But, if things do not go as planned, chalk it up to just another life lesson, and try again some time.",1193408965

Underneath the two highlighted sections, the only text should be ""How it Works"".<p>The Provider Identity Authentication section was confusing to me. I'm sure it makes sense once you're signed up, but it's too much to have on the front page. <p>You guys are really going in the right direction though. Good work.<p>EDIT:<p>The two highlighted sections. You have three bullet points for each: use one. <p>On the left: ""Talk to qualified information sources""<p>On the right: ""Share your knowledge""<p>On the bottom: ""How it works""<p>Seriously, I think if you can pare it down to that you'll have an incredibly clear message.<p><p>",1193408322

But in a time where the record industry is pulling some incredibly (and also not-so-incredibly to by fair) haywire moves, its important to try to normalize for all the ""thank you"" they were getting for the good will (which if what they do becomes the norm, won't get thanked for quite so often).",1193407990

He definitely doesn't make ""lawyer money"", but he doesn't live like a pauper either.<p>I don't know how software lawyers fare, or how people employed by organizations that primarily deal with software ethics (I guess that's the right term) fare, but I'd guess there's a living to be made. While I'm guessing, I'd guess that it's going to get progressively easier for people to make a living in such fields for the next year or five.",1229007557

If businesses developed more organically with a balance between capital and labor, the Chinese middle class would grow and China would achieve wage parity with the West and would compete on similar terms.

Assuming that  your site is totally down when your server goes down and that you rely on jquery so heavily that loosing it essentially renders your site unusable it doesn't seem to matter how much better google is at delivering content than you are.

It requires a perhaps two-line tweak to your web server configuration files to make it answer requests on domains other than www.example.com<p>For example, my main domain is www.bingocardcreator.com .  There are some honking images which load on the front page that used to block the (more valuable to my conversion pathway) images on the sidebar from popping up.  I reconfigured my webserver to accept images1 through images4 as acceptable host names, and (lazily) manually split the static assets over the 5 hosts.<p>This actually resulted in improving the loading of my sidebar by upwards of a second.  That is worth, oh, probably $100 a month or so.

Inventing and entrepreneurship is harder there to get going because of current social trends, but if you make it, you make it huge. One U.S. dollar is equal to 6.8 Chinese RMB right now, and the purchasing power of 1 RMB is about the same as 1 USD, or at least was when I was there a few years ago. That means if you build something with wide appeal that can sell in markets with stronger currency (or even just HK/Shanghai/Beijing), you make it bigtime. Riskier? Yes. But the potential quality of life you can build in a short time is ridiculously wonderful if you make some breakthroughs.",1229005237

If there&#x27;s any nation you&#x27;d expect to support linguistic diversity it&#x27;s Lithuania, where just speaking the native language was an act of resistance against Soviet oppression.<p>They spent the whole train journey bitching about these Slovenians who wouldn&#x27;t speak English.<p>> When I started learning programming there were a few resources available only in russian on russian forums(RE related) same with chinese. At the same time people who didn&#x27;t know any better think russians are technologically behind and still do.<p>Most of us who program or do science want it to be useful. Look at Linux - started by a Finn, but internationally successful (and not just in English-speaking countries - a lot of developers are German), because he wrote it in English.<p>> China, Japan, Russia, Iran, probably a bunch of Arab countries, Germany(although this one is argueably[sic] moving to english as scientific language) have vibrant scientific communities, that you can only understand if you speak the respective language.<p>Which means a lot of duplicated effort that could be better spent (duplicating science can sometimes be useful but if we could coordinate then we could be much smarter about it).<p>> maybe it is us who should make more available in chinese. Also keep in mind that for a very long time Arab was the defacto scientific language of south east asia.<p>Sure, there&#x27;s nothing particularly special about English (well, there are a few conveniences like ASCII and the ease of new coinages, and the existing spread of people who know the language). I don&#x27;t have a problem with non-English languages that are already major world languages in the field.<p>But let&#x27;s stop deliberately erecting barriers to communication in the name of &quot;diversity&quot;. Let&#x27;s not turn Computer Science from a field where all participants can understand each other into a field where one half can&#x27;t talk to the other half. Let&#x27;s make education in English and other true world languages as widely available as possible (and stop wasting our children&#x27;s time teaching them a language that would only let them talk to 5 million people, all of whom speak English anyway - bitter welsh guy here).",1399367070

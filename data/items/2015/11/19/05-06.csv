This is a statistical phenomenon by which alleles that are near neutral for viability change in frequency until one becomes fixed.

As such, we are well positioned to provide financial services and marketing services to sellers efficiently and intelligently. For example, one of our financial services, Square Capital, uses our deep understanding of our sellers’ businesses to proactively underwrite and extend cash advances to them. Although Square Capital is still in its early stages, we have already advanced over $225 million since launching it in May 2014. Square Capital demonstrates how our services can rapidly reach significant scale through a combination of strong demand and our direct, ongoing interactions with our sellers. Although Square Capital currently does not contribute a significant amount of revenue to our business relative to our payments and POS services, our software and data product revenue, including revenue derived from Square Capital, has grown quickly, and we expect these products will contribute a larger portion of our total revenue over time. Marketing services, such as Square Customer Engagement, give sellers easy-to-use tools to help them close the loop between communication with a buyer and ultimately a new sale. We currently see more than 1.5 million monthly feedback communications sent by buyers to sellers through digital receipts. Together, our financial services and marketing services provide sellers with access to capital and access to customers, making it easier for them to accomplish their goals.</i> [0]<p>Transaction fees is a loss leader, but this isn&#x27;t their business model.

Many of my friends work at these companies and have been to US to work onsite with clients. When I asked them why they don’t look for another job in US, their take was that they don’t want to settle in US. They have their family, friends in India and they just want to make their “money” and return home. They don’t consider themselves “cheap labor” as the article states because they do save a lot of money as compared to what they were making in India. They also don’t want to take a risk of branching out and working at a startup unless its a big name. Which is understandable, very few of them have worked at startups and with most startups failing they don’t want to take the risk of finding another job or going back to India empty handed. Unless they have studied in US and did a couple of part time jobs or internships in US its tough to convince someone to be a part of your startup. That said, I will love for this idea to be successful. Good luck!",1447912555

All of the signal processing was done in software, and even that was pretty simple - magstripes are low bit-density binary, after all. The readers were simple enough that they made the first few hundred by hand, in San Francisco. Once they started mass producing them they were dirt cheap.<p>Gradually that&#x27;s changed, though. Pressure from the credit card industry and other payment processors forced Square to start encrypting the magstripe data so that malware on smartphones wouldn&#x27;t have access to the card numbers (I don&#x27;t know whether this is a legitimate concern, but the pressure was strong).

Yes, it&#x27;s easy to use a 2to3/3to2 tool but unlike transpilers in Javascript the output code may still require fine-tuning after the tranform.<p>This could be solved by adding preprocessor support to python (ie for conditional loading of code) but GvR is adamantly against this approach use to the way many devs write unmaintainable code in c via the preprocessor.<p>I actually published an OSS project called pypreprocessor that was supposed to solve this issue. It works to add preprocessor conditionals to code but won&#x27;t work with both 2/3 code in the same file because there&#x27;s no hook to inline code before lexer runs and throws syntax errors.<p>Second, package management in python still sucks. Do you use distutils, distutils2, setup.py, etc? There&#x27;s no single standardized approach that everybody agrees on and each tool follows a unique approach or needs to be supported because of legacy code.<p>Unlike the Ruby, Javascript ecosystem where package management and publishing is relatively straightforward/easy, it&#x27;s an absolute PITA to publish packages to PYPI.<p>Back in 2011, the answer was. Just wait 5 years for everybody to adapt their libraries to support Python 3. 5 years later, nothing has changed. The existing libraries don&#x27;t want to piss off users by dropping Python2 support and maintaining two separate branches of the code in parallel sucks. So, since most everybody that uses python in production still relies on Python2, Python2 is still the default.<p>The library ecosystem makes the platform. The tooling sucks so library devs don&#x27;t want to make the switch.<p>Until there is a major cultural shift python devs have 2 options. Use a better version of the language without the support of a mature library ecosystem, or use an outdated version of the language with a rich ecosystem.",1447909518

So when someone comes in and tries to buy up all the open orders at once they&#x27;ll cancel their orders on other exchanges that haven&#x27;t been executed yet so they can reprice to reflect the increased demand.

47216,comment,47147,47173,0,0,cellis,,,"Well yes, it is rare. But this isn't really hacking--its more art and css/html (digital media). I worked with this 17 year old CSS girl at my last job. I asked her why she didn't want to go in to tech, since she was so good. She told me something to the effect that because she was asian and firstborn, she had to do what her mom wanted, which was for her to be a lawyer. blah ",1188258700

47214,comment,47147,47207,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"She has, quite effectively, hedged her investments against such an occurrence.  If you read the article, you'll see that she is playing on multiple social networks, cell phones, and online utilities.  She's a damned mogul, and the lot of us should be so lucky to cover our asses as effectively.  She's going to do very very well in life as long as she keeps her head on straight when things get crazy and when markets evolve (and as she grows up).<p>Of course, I also agree that betting on MySpace or Facebook alone is a death wish.",1188258306

The startup is TReX Global (dorky/awesome name I know) that is being self-funded by two former Intuit VP's. The founders are some of the nicest guys I've ever known and that's why I joined them. The product is  like an online version of TurboTax, but geared specifically towards Real Estate investors. Both of the founders have been active real estate investors over the years and so are passionate about this market's pain-points they are solving. If you have any interest in that industry, this is an amazing opportunity.<p>They are a Ruby on Rails shop, and the skills they are particularly looking for are super-solid frontend skills (js, css, etc). RoR background is helpful but not required.<p>The pay and options are really great and you'll be working out of a garage, but with a very flexible schedule - telecommuting etc.<p>Let me know if you're interested - just contact me at matt.jaynes on gmail.<p>Thanks!\nMatt<p><a href=""https://www.trexglobal.com/application"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.trexglobal.com/application</a> (Product)<p><a href=""http://web.intuit.com/about_intuit/executives/pankaj_shukla.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.intuit.com/about_intuit/executives/pankaj_shukla....</a> (Founder - CEO)<p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pub/0/881/b09"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkedin.com/pub/0/881/b09</a> (Founder - President)",1188258246

47209,comment,46701,47137,0,0,giardini,,,"But you _can't_ apply the gains from one incident to buy additional insurance for the second, because the two incidents could happen simultaneously (before you had purchased additional insurance). And this is not merely a theoretical situation but a practical one, since there are delays between first incident and payout and between purchase of additional coverage and coverage applied.<p>IOW all purchases of insurance must be done beforehand at the same time. Purchases of insurance cannot be contingent, although the gains may be. So you can't wait and see if one incident occurs to decide whether to buy more insurance.",1188258161

47200,comment,45698,45698,0,0,wpietri,,,"Excellent points, except it's clear you've never spend much time pair programming in a small team. There, the rules are a little different, as the design is a collaborative process. <p>Although there's more inertia than working solo, I like team pair programming better. You get third-draft code in first-draft time when pairing, and having to continuously collaborate on the design sharpens your thinking a lot. \n",1188255915

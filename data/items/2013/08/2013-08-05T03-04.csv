It doesn&#x27;t matter if it happens by default when it does happen. It might not be reversible.<p>2. Corollary to that, I believe it has happened. During the NSA scandal, I tried to do what I could to dispel what could best be described as hysteria. I don&#x27;t believe the majority of people on Hacker News can be described by hysteria, but <i>a hugely vocal minority can be</i>, and they direct the movements of the front page.<p>3. I am not pessimistic about Hacker News, I don&#x27;t like to believe the forum is succumbing to the inexorable march of time, or some such. And I&#x27;m not going to soapbox comparisons to reddit. However, I don&#x27;t think optimism is enough. You don&#x27;t seem to be particularly concerned about this, but I see sentiments of concern at least <i>daily</i> in some form or another.<p>I understand I&#x27;m not a powerhouse of karma and influence here on Hacker News, but I&#x27;ve tried twice to raise proposals for some sort of change to the political atmosphere of the forum. It hasn&#x27;t worked. What else do you have but optimism, to put it bluntly?<p>EDIT: When I joined Hacker News in 2011, I wasn&#x27;t as savvy to the mechanics of the forum as I am now. I thought that the front page being dominated by political fads every few months or so was just regular. But in being here to the present, I&#x27;ve seen that it has only gotten worse from 2011 to 2013, and in reading archives/the comments of senior members, I can see how this pattern developed. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve tried before to submit a proposal to the changes thread.<p>I submit that it doesn&#x27;t matter if politics can be intellectually gratifying or even relevant, as per the guidelines. It&#x27;s categorically unrelated to startups or technology, save for being indirectly so in occasional cases when those two topics scale. Whatever benefit comes with political discourse is eliminated by the sheer level of scathing derision that comes from combatting sides debating the topic.",1375675158

In my field, >50% of the data we receive is transferred by overnight courier of hard drives due to quantity of data. It&#x27;s a crappy attitude to blame people for having to learn that, and in an ideal world we&#x27;d share it via access granted by email. People should not be blamed for not understanding that, our infrastructure should be blamed for not supporting 10Gb everywhere, and cheap access to 40Gb+ on long-distance connections.<p>Nothing is helped by blaming people, and relationships can be harmed by doing that. But we can change the technology.<p>As a side note, DVDs? Really? They&#x27;re incredibly slow at data transfer once you have them in hand, the tiny size of a DVD requires tricky archive spanning methods, and optical discs are flaky technology all around.

However, unless I&#x27;m mistaken (my field is more chemistry-simulation than physics-simulation), the internal nature of the proton is not necessary for achieving chemical accuracy level results from something like FCIQMC, namely because the chemical properties of interest are the result of only the charge interactions of the protons/electrons as potential terms in the Schrodinger equation.  I believe applying QMC to solve that equation for all charge-charge interactions (including electron correlation) is enough to reach essentially exact energy levels (in the limit of simulation time -> infinity) ... am I incorrect?

However especially with TIFF there are/were countless implementations of viewers, components, libraries and every single one of them had their own habits. Some would not regard endianess, some would assume payload endianess is the same as the TIFF, some did respect the Tag for byte order specific to the image. When I coded my first TIFF Library, I was around 14 and the most troublesome part of doing it was keeping myself from bashing my head against the next available wall due to stupidity of other people who thought interpreting a standard according to their wishes was ok, because there&#x27;d never be someone trying to display the images with a viewer different from theirs.<p>I don&#x27;t know how deep you have dived into TIFF, but maybe you remember the TIFF6 Standard way of embedding JPEG. It was the biggest pain in the ass imaginable, having to parse JPEG files, splitting them and packaging it into different TIFF Tags. Before TTN2 and easy embedding of JPEG Images, <i>everyone</i> invented their own way of avoiding the standard.

6158336,comment,6156615,6157085,1,0,aspensmonster,,,"Indeed. Many people seem to misunderstand the purpose of the tor network. It is designed to conceal the sourcing node of a packet. That&#x27;s it. Nothing more, nothing less. The only guarantee you get --and the only one you really need to remain anonymous-- is that your IP isn&#x27;t stamped on the packets coming out of the exit node. You&#x27;re not supposed to trust the exit node --or anything else you connect to through it-- for anything else. That&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t send login credentials in the clear over the exit node. It&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t send plaintext email over tor, or sign into services that are ever touched by a non-tor connection, or engage in plaintext conversation on IRC and have any expectation of privacy. Tor guarantees a different IP on the network packet, and <i>that is it</i>. And so far, it seems that the Tor project has made good on this guarantee.

And it doesn&#x27;t require engagement.<p>What you see on both reddit and slashdot is an increasing tendency toward irony as the basic approach to any subject (4chan is the same way too). This overwhelms and actively drives away discussions that are serious and not ironic. This is why the highest quality subreddits (like askscience and askhistorians) enforce very strict rules and actively discourage humor for humor&#x27;s sake.

I&#x27;ve been using CoffeeScript for about a year for the usual front-end crap, not long ago I re-evaluated Coffee for the second time before starting a full-JS project and certainly won&#x27;t use it. While I&#x27;m a fan of bracketless whitespace significant langs (Python, Sass, Haml) CS&#x27;s is just bonkers and you never know when a single space will bite you by compiling to a completely different code you had in mind. The ecosystem is weak not to say non-existent comparing to JS, and every JS solution and example out there from minor jquery stuff through SPA frameworks to mobile UI builders is in, well, JS (duh!), so public code reusability becomes a ridiculous task of converting to CS, only to compile it to JS once again. I still use CoffeeScript for small front-end work, meanwhile for any bigger work I find CS an obstacle over JS, and an unnecessary step between my idea and working code; especially when the JS ecosystem has grown a lot of tools to help you deal with what pisses you off (underscore/lodash as an example come to mind).<p>And from the slide:<p>> <i>And as of July 2013, it&#x27;s also the tenth most popular language on GitHub! That&#x27;s more than Objective-C, ActionScript, C#, Clojure, Go, Groovy, Scala</i><p>Yay github charts as evidence of industry value.<p>Knee-jerk, fallacies, resistance? Call it what you want and good luck. Meanwhile, I will use coffee to keep me awake, not to write apps with.<p>//edit: care to explain the downvote?",1375674299

6158218,comment,6157485,6157827,1,0,brightsize,,,"> If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one&#x27;s intellectual curiosity.<p>Bingo.  I love HN for this very reason.  Each time I visit, which is several times a day, I can count on finding a batch of postings about stuff I&#x27;m interested in: tech, startups, theoretical and applied science, law, philosophy, and yes, politics, just to name a few things, and quite often the intersection of one or more of these.  I&#x27;m not a HN old timer, so may have missed-out on the before-the-Fall HN, but I have no regrets about that because it must have been a duller place.<p>I was a Slashdot addict before discovering HN.  At one point I remember being really, really impressed by the great variety of people who posted there, people who had subject matter expertise that was all over the board.  I might see, for example, a posting of an article about research into controlled fusion, and then browsing the comments I find information and insight posted by actual researchers in the field.  This is what HN gives me today, and it&#x27;s fantastic.<p>Perhaps a bit OT, but another thing that I love about HN is the level of civility in the comments and the swiftness with which people who break those unwritten(?) rules of decorum face chastisement.  Rudeness is called out.  People often humbly admit when they&#x27;ve made an error and apologize for it.  People who make spelling or grammar errors aren&#x27;t childishly flamed for it.  HN feels like a big room full of well-mannered, intelligent adults, whereas /. (now) is a room full of twits and children and trolls and vandals.  I have a hard time imagining HN ever becoming THAT because of the quality of this audience.<p>HN seems to have become not just a forum full of hackers, but a forum full of <i>intellectuals</i> including the non-hacker variety.  These intellectuals, hackers and otherwise, have a diverse range of expertise, interests, curiosities, and passions.  I learn something new every day from HN, usually tech or business-related, but often not, and I think that HN would be a far less interesting place if it was narrowly tech/startup focused.  For me, HN simply ain&#x27;t broke.",1375672456

6158215,comment,6157485,6157860,2,0,scythe,,,">For too long the minimal to zero reporting these issues have received in the majority of news outlets was met with an abundance of silence and indifference. Outside of a few communities on the net (and fewer offline), there hasn&#x27;t been discussion on these issues. The Guardian finally breaks one story that manages to have legs for a week or two in the mainstream press and we&#x27;re done here?<p>I feel that you&#x27;ve highlighted a possible underlying cause of HN&#x27;s present malaise, which is: many community members here are poorly connected on the Internet. HN is an open website, which means that it is very easy for someone who is new to the Internet to find and browse. If you&#x27;ve been commenting a lot in the recent political threads, I can make the following predictions: you&#x27;ve participated in online fora for less than ten years, and you don&#x27;t pursue social connections much deeper than reddit user flair.<p>If you would like to take part in a lot of technical and political discussions regarding surveillance, you should consider joining a newsgroup or mailing list (if there still are any, I know politech and cypherpunks are dead) specifically devoted to this discussion. Usenet requires a modicum of effort (and maybe a subscription fee) to participate, which can help to limit the discussion to serious contribution by serious participants. You may also want to subscribe to and comment on blogs by people who know about these things, so you can get to know people and contribute to a discussion that, in order to be any good, must stretch on far longer than a single comment thread. There are communities devoted to this sort of discussion.<p>The content-link plus tree-style-comments format of HN is good for day-long free-form discussion on lighthearted issues of interest to technical people. It is not suited for deep, long-term discussion of complex political issues. HN can&#x27;t be usefully political even if it wants to be, any more than HN can be used to design novel methods of quantum error correction. Some things just aren&#x27;t suited for the HN style of discussion.",1375672345

They are pretty similar, in fact the Foundation CSS has a larger footprint (86kb vs 65kb). I think people say it because Foundation feels more &quot;raw&quot; but this is not a selling point in my opinion. In fact I find that Foundation&#x27;s biggest flaw is that it&#x27;s components don&#x27;t look that hot.<p>I will also agree Bootstrap <i>is</i> a quick and easy way to get something up. I would argue it is quicker and easier than Foundation, but many people with serious CSS skills don&#x27;t want to work with it for some of the reasons I brought up. I think that Foundation is more flexible and extensible which is a big strength.<p>However, none of this is that important for a landing page, I have been able to build landing pages quite comfortably with both and don&#x27;t think either has a huge advantage here.

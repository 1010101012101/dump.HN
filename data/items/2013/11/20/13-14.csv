Relationships cannot be metric&#x27;d - and that is why they are so important.<p>If what you are getting in your job experience is valuable - that is excellent - however, if you are building true relationships (where relationships are built on trust - almost approaching - perhaps beyond a romantic level) - then. Don&#x27;t rule out the CS program - there has to be at least one or two professors in the department that you hit it off with - and if not in CS, maybe in another department. When you are in college, there is an open-door policy with professors - depending on how persistent you are.<p>Avoid burnout by <i>not</i> putting everything into one area of your life. Its inevitable (depending on your focus, type-A ness) but you can hedge by doing stuff where no one cares what you do outside of that sphere (e.g. drawing portraits in a drawing class)<p>Ultimately, as you progress in your life, you build your own community. The size and strength of it depends on you, your leadership ability - and your ability to inspire others to do what they want to do (the true Internet superstars like Zenhabits, Problogger et al. build communities in the millions).<p>I&#x27;ve been in my small share of companies/long-term projects (with friends) that sometimes end up - the friendship isn&#x27;t strong enough to survive the problems that may arise.<p>And, as others said, the degree is an important quasi-legal HR credential (look up Griggs v. Duke Energy) and signal that you were able to start and finish a large project<p>Also, diversify your basket - take a theater or short/long-form improv class or art class.

If I use &#x27;11111&#x27; to sign up for a onetime visit to a website, then there&#x27;s no nexus with my online banking account other than an email address - assuming even the most feeble attempt at picking a &#x27;secure&#x27; password for my banking.<p>This is why it is often silly when articles condemn users for weak passwords when a password list is stolen. The proper assumption is that any password I use is stored and transmitted in plain text and just now falling into the hands of bad people.<p>This is the reason that until I started expressing this idea on HN, that my HN password was &quot;hackernews&quot;.

I know how much runway I have to make it a success, and I&#x27;m confident I can get work pricing myself below market rates (anyone can sell $5 for $4 forever). But I&#x27;ve heard a lot of people say you shouldn&#x27;t try to be the lowest-priced option, because then you end up with clients who don&#x27;t respect your time. I was worried that I might have to choose between market rates and be outcompeted by people with better portfolios, and low rates and clients I didn&#x27;t like. This seems like a great third way. Start out below market, and raise my hourly rate by $1 for every 100 hours. I&#x27;ll have plenty of time for portfolio building, even if I have to hustle for people who aren&#x27;t my ideal clients (which actually sounds like a necessary experience anyway). Then when my rate goes up, if those customers don&#x27;t think my time is that valuable, we can just part ways.",1384955209

6767778,comment,6767590,6767590,5,0,VLM,,,"I have a couple friends in the biz and whats (carefully, to meet an agenda?) not discussed is why the automation exists in the first place.  Most of their time and brainpower is expended on what HN would call hacking the system, such as taking a decade of experience on that route and more than a decade as a pilot, plus inadequate out of date weather info, plus gossip from other pilots, plus a close reading of the manuals to request a FL 4000 feet lower which under these peculiar wx conditions results in lower fuel burn.  Or hacking ATC by figuring out there will be a backlog at the destination because of weather reports 2000 miles away and experience, so instead of burning 2000 extra dollars of extra fuel in a holding pattern, he decides to burn 1000 extra dollars of fuel getting there before the rush begins.   Of course this kind of stuff requires the cooperation of ATC etc etc its not cowboys and the wild west, but suffice it to say he does a heck of a lot of thinking about flying while some automation keeps the wings level or whatever.<p>Another thing is he has a very maint engineering type job continuously prioritizing all possible issues while working on the most critical one.  This doesn&#x27;t mean he flys thru tornados every flight, its more like there has never been a truly flawless aircraft.  He won&#x27;t take off if there&#x27;s anything on the critical list but there&#x27;s always &quot;something&quot; non critical or needs special observation because it was just serviced/replaced/needs servicing, basically he&#x27;s the partner of the mechanics and has something of a &quot;trust, but verify&quot; relationship with them.<p>So its hardly a one way street.  Take away the automation and force him to keep the wings level, manually by hand, for the entire flight, and he is NOT going to be able to spend 15 minutes putting together enroute weather reports and pireps and maps and gut level experience with the plane in that climate and on that route, so that minor rainstorm that turned into a sudden t-storm enroute kills everyone in a downdraft because he was &quot;too busy flying the plane&quot;.  Or the mechanic replaced fuel pump #2 on engine #2 but something went wrong, and he doesn&#x27;t have time to watch the pump pressure and temp soar out of control because he&#x27;s &quot;too busy flying the plane&quot;, setting the engine, then wing on fire and they ditch in the ocean and everyone dies.  So yeah, automation kills some people, but lack of automation would obviously kill MORE people.<p>There are also financial issues, where the money you save by efforts at fuel economy might buy you a TCAS system that prevents a mid-air collision... or maybe the money saved just buys some crooked exec another Ferrari.  Either way the pilot is going to be required to spend his day on heroic fuel economization efforts.<p>As in many areas of the economy, there&#x27;s a zillion applicants for each job.  Being a programmer in SV is not like any other career in the country.  So there&#x27;s always some slacking and some slackers, but most pilots are in fact pretty hard working.

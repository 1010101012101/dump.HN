2660783,comment,2657554,2658549,1,0,PixelRobot,,,"I've noticed that most extroverts think like this. People who are extroverted usually have problems understanding what being introverted is like, and usually just see it as a different label to give social anxiety a more socially acceptable image, since it seems it's easier to understand for them. They assume everybody is an extrovert, just like them, but some people just feel social anxiety and call themselves extroverts. What you call ""the traditional use"" seems to me like the traditional misconception about introverts.<p>I'm an introvert myself, and I don't feel social anxiety. I grew up thinking I was shy, since my introversion seemed to be traditionally and socially identified with shyness, but at one point I realized I didn't feel social anxiety at all. It actually seemed to me that extrovert were much more worried about social situations and how they were perceived socially than me.<p>I don't try to explain my introversion to extroverts because I've noticed most of them don't get it. This makes it hard to use as an excuse, or even as a reasonable reason for your behaviour. I get dragged to social situations sometimes because extroverted people just assume I'll have fun if I just relax a bit, and sometimes I accept because I don't want to be rude. The result is I don't feel anxious or anything like that, I just get bored fast and want to go home soon. If I were actually interested in some activity being an introvert wouldn't get in the way, because being interested in it would keep my interest. It's just that social activities don't usually keep my interest for too long. They just feel like a boring waste of time to me, not something that makes me anxious.<p>This doesn't mean I don't enjoy social situations sometimes. I enjoy parties and concerts and stuff like that. I'm just the kind of guy who leaves the party early with some kind of excuse, not because of social anxiety, but because I'm starting to get tired and bored with the whole thing. I don't ever use ""I'm an introvert"" as an excuse, since I know people will not get it. I don't use it and I don't see other people use it to explain why they do certain things or don't do other things.",1308223379

In older designs the variable speed of wind was addressed by using a (massive) gearbox, not unlike what you have in your car. The newer designs (e.g. what Siemens Windpower is churning out now) are gearless, don't suffer from that problem, and have in ballpark of 40% better energy efficiency.<p>The cap/penetration effects of wind power on the grid are being studied, but on levels below 1/5th of total consumption it is believed to not cause any substantial problems.

For example - no mechanism for dealing with situations where someone change data underneath the object graph a user is working against in memory. AR would blast over the top of the data with what it has in memory, potentially breaking in the process.<p>Some ORM systems have locking levels. For example, with 'optimistic locking' you get an exception if data changed underneath you. It's handy to be able to catch an exception, email the support team, and tell the user to freeze and contact them, in a way that doesn't discard the data they've just entered.<p>I find it backwards that active record exposes methods like insert, delete, update. These are low-level sql concepts, and you shouldn't need to care about them within an object system where you're thinking in terms of a graph of data. It's very wired to the database though. As far as a ""mapping"" between object and relational, active record is crudely simple.<p>On a positive note, you can hammer an AR out in your language of choice from memory, without reference to any external libraries or the like.

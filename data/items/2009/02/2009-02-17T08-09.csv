484287,comment,483548,483620,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"> I think this is a classic business model problem with consultative services: 60-80% of the work is, in fact, cookie-cutter stuff that can be executed by any barely-competant practioner...<p>The ""cookie cutter nature"" depends on whether the client thinks s/he knows what s/he wants already.<p>A real, good design consultant will come up with awesome, non-cookie-cutter shit taht the client would <i>never</i> think of. That's why the client is not a designer.<p>A ""barely competent"" designer will implement the client's mediocre, pedestrian request in a barely competent way.<p>And when you hire somebody ""barely competent,"" even for something ""cookie cutter,"" you get things such as a brochureware cafe site that talks about its beautiful gardens but does not list an address, hours, or a contact number.<p>The problem, for clients, for hiring based on spec work, is the fact that the designer ""wins"" by shiny, not with careful consideration of the ""problem.""<p>And if design is any part of your strategy (and it ought to be), you're undercutting your own success.<p>EDIT: This is not to say that anybody calling themselves a design consultant is any <i>good</i>. There are very few truly excellent people out there -- in any field.",1234860590

    The truth is that there are no incentives you can

The ""big 7"" verbs seem to me to be limited and arbitrary, and while very interesting as a kind of natural API I don't use it for browser pages.<p>I think Rails over-hypes ""REST everywhere"" and if you don't have a clear use case, I'd forget about it, at least on ""normal"" pages. Trying to unify API access and normal web pages seems pointless to me. I also have other concerns, which I funnily enough wrote about:<p><a href=""http://fukamachi.org/wp/2008/04/01/restful-confusion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fukamachi.org/wp/2008/04/01/restful-confusion/</a><p>Good to see you, look forward to seeing the fruits of your labour!",1234859045

It is all about intent, and you are asking a designer to do custom work for you with the intent not to pay.<p>I've said it is inherently evil, and somethings like this are going to happen.<p>I like the saying ""there is no such thing as a great designer, only a great client.""  You drive the design, and if you resort to sites like these, you open yourself up to a slew of legal issues, and wave the flag that you are not willing to work on one of the most important public parts of you company.",1234857918

And we all know the anecdotes of companies that patent every trivial modification they implement on standard algorithms or data structures.<p>On the other hand, I do know at least one scientist who checks out all the patents granted to a competing lab to keep tabs on the sort of research they do. He claims that, in our field, patents are a far better indicator of the amount of effort a lab is expending on a topic than papers published or press releases put out. <i>shrugs</i>",1234857655

Because I have studied film formally in a limited context, I can say that there's a lot of planning, communication and collaboration that goes into creating a film, from storyboarding to script writing and doctoring to photography and lighting. And, for someone familiar with the technical details of composing scenes, it is possible to get an understanding of why directors make certain decisions in keeping with a particular style.<p>I liken programming to that process. There's a fair amount of intention and consideration that goes into composition. With activities, such as pair programming, I argue that is possible to see inside a creator's head.<p>The benefit of participating in a hackathon is fluidity. There are monolithic projects for which the hackathon was not designed to address. But, at the end of the day, you're a better problem solver by working under the constraints of that kind of environment.",1329699576

3610917,comment,3609485,3610396,6,0,Locke1689,,,"This isn't correct. You're falling victim to a fallacy sometimes known as privileging the hypothesis. When you look back and say, ""Look at all the things people thought were impossible but are now possible!"" you're ignoring all things that people thought were impossible and are still impossible. Moreover, you're looking over all the things people thought were possible but are actually impossible.<p>The entire frame of your questions shows the fallacy because you explicitly abandon all other notions to just come up with things that were thought impossible but are now mundane.<p>It's true that we don't know everything, but implying that because we don't know everything we know nothing is absolutely ridiculous. All current knowledge of physics points towards entropy, and moreover the second law of thermodynamics, as being one of the most important and consistent laws of physics. It's so important that one of the most well-known physicists in the world is so well-known because he created a theory of black holes that meshes with our existing theory of entropy, proving that the second law still holds. The idea that we should abandon this knowledge because, well, it's inconvenient strikes me as being disingenuous in the highest order.<p>Anyone can say, ""Well, you don't know everything, so you may be wrong."" That doesn't make it an informed or useful comment.",1329699526

It will be like going to sleep and waking up in the virtual reality environment. From the clones perspective it will feel like the original you since it has all the memories of the original up to the point before you went to sleep. You just have to make sure that the original you is destroyed if and only if the virtual you is created successfully and with no corruptions. Otherwise there might be problems between the real you and the clone.<p>Side note: I believe there was an episode in Star Trek where something like this would happen. Star Trek made a treaty with an alien race to allow them to visit their planet via teleportation over huge distances. The thing is that they would not really teleport the person but rather they would create an exact clone at the destination and destroy the original.",1329699465
3610913,comment,3609485,3609485,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"These sorts of things strike me as a bit off. One of the problems of being a doctor, much like being a police officer, is that you tend to get exposed to the worst experiences. Good folks may have the occasional run-in. With police but by far the bulk of encounters a police officer has will be with the worst parts of humanity, again and again. Which can lead them to become jaded, depressed, etc.<p>The same sort of dynamics play out with doctors too. People who get better stop spending time in the hospital, and stop being seen by doctors so often. This can lead doctors to a false view of late stage medical care. They see every moment of the pain and suffering, the struggling that turns out to be in vain, the sheer cost of heroic measures, but they often miss out on seeing the benefits. The time given back to patients who then spend happy years with their family away from hospitals and doctors.",1329699384

3610894,comment,3609880,3610683,1,0,shantanubala,,,"> why should I have pay for the risky behaviour of parents of poor children<p>It's not a similar argument: people don't chose who their parents are, or where they  grow up. The quality of life of a person who receives education (even if our education system isn't perfect) is definitely greater than the quality of life of a person who stays uneducated. It can actually reduce crime rates and improve the overall standard of living.<p>Startups are a little different, because the risks are optional, and there is a <i>huge</i> reward for success already built into the system. There are already tons of VC's making money helping entrepreneurs make money. It's a system that attracts people, and it's <i>optional</i>.<p>That doesn't mean we shouldn't teach entrepreneurship and creativity, but the human capital of the startup world is more of a luxury than a basic education. I would prioritize fixing our current education system before adding another layer of complexity.<p>If we can teach our kids in a way that allows them to be creative and inventive with already-established tools (writing, math, arts, etc.), they will definitely be better entrepreneurs.

If you put that url as the src of an img tag, and the user is logged in, some sites will 302 you to the image. If you are not logged in, the src will be the login page, and you can detect the difference with javascript.<p>Quote from the site:<p><i>What happens if you visit the login page with a redirect on login parameter and you are already logged in? When implemented in a naive fashion you are simply immediately redirected to the page specified in the parameter. Some sites limit that parameter to being another page on the same domain, but well see that doesnt help for this trick.<p>This mechanism is open to abuse in exactly the way I needed; I could set the redirect on login page to be an image file on the same domain. For example:<p><img src=""<a href=""https://twitter.com/login?redirect_after_login=%2Fimages%2Fspinner.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/login?redirect_after_login=%2Fimages%2Fs...</a> />\nIn this example, if I am logged in Twitter is kind enough to 302 redirect me to the image file I specified, but if I am not logged in I am show the login page. It turns out that both Twitter and Googles login mechanisms are susceptible to exactly this trick. It seems LinkedIn and Tumblr are currently immune to this, though I didnt dig too deep so there might be another redirect URL for them.</i>",1329697348

In my experience, an environment without women devolves into some ""Lord of the Flies""-type shit pretty quickly unless you're super careful about who you hire, personality-wise.<p>Seriously, all research done on the matter indicates that women are just as effective as software development as men, so the lack of women in software development indicates it's far from the meritocracy you seem to imagine it is.<p>This ""either you are qualified for the job, or you aren't  so it's ok to act like an asshole"" bullshit has gotten pretty old in 2012. Here's a clue: if you're a lead developer creating an environment that's hostile to a large pool of potentially highly skilled developers, you're not fucking qualified, regardless of your coding skills.

It's easy to overlook a great job on AT&T/Starbucks part, it is very user friendly.<p>Another point on this - there are several other coffee chains that offer free internet, but for most you have to ask for a code and it expires after an hour or two. Starbucks avoided that issue altogether, and I think they benefit more from it. It might be an intentional culture thing - by offering uncapped free internet, you risk have people turn your coffee shop into their office, but the customers who are going to turn your store into their office are going to find a way to do it no matter what (even if that means they have to ask for the internet code every two hours).",1329696084

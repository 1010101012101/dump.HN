10524524,comment,10521835,10522799,0,0,PythonicAlpha,,,"Yea, and I see this as one of the main reasons, the quality of work is declining instead of improving (due to technical advances). In my country, when you build a building today, you hire a builder company. This company does <i>no</i> building themselves. They buy the parts of the building from subcontractors and some times the subcontractors buy the service needed from sub-subcontractors. And the company that finally does the job, some times, they even do it not with their own workers, but hire some cheap temporary staff to do the work.<p>So finally, who is to blame, when the window is not even? The builder? No! He did nothing. The windowing subcontractor?? Technical yes, but practical he just used hired workers. Some times ago, it was possible to say: Here we have a good company, with good reputation, the workers are proud to work for it ... Today, it is just a blaming game -- and when one of the subcontractors is sued because of bad work, they file bankruptcy, because there is also no financial basis -- the companies are just empty shells.<p>What also adds up to this is, that on every level of this game, only the price of the service is evaluated today -- not the quality. I also saw cases, where the builder company was a big one with great reputation, but the execution was awful! The reason: Bad contractors.<p>Another reason in my country is, that the requirements for workers in the building sector have been deliberately drastically lowered by the government, to make way for even cheaper work.<p>Today, (at least in my country) one that wants a house for his family to be build, has no means to decide, if the company will succeed and make a good house or will build a horror house. In most cases, there will be several topics where the execution was bad or really bad and you can call yourself lucky, when the additional costs after the house was finalized are moderate.<p>There are some really bad cases, where families thought the house would be ready in time and canceled their rent-flat just to be on the streets afterwards, because their house was not ready even months after the deadline. Some where never finished.",1446897294

A lot of people who suddenly get rich or famous meltdown, because they still don&#x27;t know what to do. And a lot of people who go all-in on their careers burn out. There are opportunities that you can miss and regret, but you aren&#x27;t an abstract person or a movie action hero - you won&#x27;t be &quot;on&quot; all the time.<p>Instead, focus on the everyday cycle. How do you want to construct your life so that you are living well each day, each week? Take whatever things you&#x27;re already good at - and can do without much effort if you just start, and concentrate - and put more of your chips behind those. It&#x27;s in the regular practice that you become really &quot;great&quot;, and there is no book or curriculum that can tell you how to practice at that level of motivation. It might lead you away from core CS, but that&#x27;s okay. There are a lot of kinds of gigs out there, and you might overlook a possibility and come back to it later, so you aren&#x27;t necessarily harming your future at this stage. Stay in good health and keep your stress down and you will get there eventually.<p>There are all sorts of little things that I&#x27;m sure other people figured out long before I did, and then things that I learned that they will never learn in their lives. If you value learning a lot, you end up not valuing wealth and status as much, because it doesn&#x27;t have much to teach you. And then it doesn&#x27;t matter that you didn&#x27;t intern at a top company, because suddenly your friends are all a bunch of weirdos too.<p>I only recently realized that technical writing was a thing I might want to do, and I&#x27;m 30.

Nevertheless it is done by mastering engineers (they rarely enjoy it) as well as by radio and tv stations extensively because of the psycho-acoustic fact that a songs appears to be better if it is played louder. This gives them an advantage over the competition: On average, people searching for a radio station are more likely to listen to your radio station if it is louder than the competition.<p>The main issue lies in the fact that the current peak measurement of audio signals does only marginally correlate with the perceived loudness and heavy compression is used to trick this system. The broadcasting industry is aware of this. An open and quite effective loudness measurement algorithm [0] has been introduced a few years ago and it gets slowly adapted all over the world by new broadcasting laws: AGCOM 219/09/CSP (Italy), ARIB TR-B32 (Japan), ATSC A/85 PRSS CALM Act (US), EBU R128 (Europe) and OP-59 (Australia). iTunes Soundcheck is also based on [0] and since this year Youtube applies this to newly uploaded videos as well [1]. Even games use [0] to keep their audio at a consistent loudness.<p>So slowly, the over-usage of compression does not give music producers and broadcasters any advantage anymore and beautiful dynamic music will be competitive again.<p>I have collected some links [2] about this topic. Because of the lack of any affordable implementation at the time I created one myself [3] with some additional notes [4].<p>[0] ITU-R BS.1770, <a href=""http://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bs/R-REC-BS.1770-4-201510-I!!PDF-E.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bs/R-REC-BS.1770-4-2...</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://productionadvice.co.uk/youtube-loudness/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://productionadvice.co.uk/youtube-loudness/</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://www.klangfreund.com/lufsmeter/manual/#about_loudness"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.klangfreund.com/lufsmeter/manual/#about_loudness</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://github.com/klangfreund/LUFSMeter"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/klangfreund/LUFSMeter</a>\n[4] <a href=""https://github.com/klangfreund/LUFSMeter/tree/master/docs/developmentNotes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/klangfreund/LUFSMeter/tree/master/docs/de...</a>",1446894743

Teachers may have a job incentive to ensure enough of their students &#x27;pass&#x27; the course and demonstrate enough understanding to move on, which can encourage different methods to try and reach more students, but students themselves have a larger incentive to learn the minimum required material somehow regardless of how the teacher teaches which will inflate the pass rate by the amount students can teach themselves what the teachers failed to teach (and little incentive beyond personal desire to learn anything beyond the minimum necessary to advance). And teachers, seeing a high pass rate for method A (which involves a ton of extra work in and out of class on their part) vs method B (which involves such minimum effort it could almost be a 9-5 job) which may have a slightly lower but still acceptable pass rate than A or C or D will in the absence of further motivation coalesce as a whole on B. In my experience very few teachers tried anything different than B. The idea you propose of students being asked to prepare a presentation with the expectation that the other students will only get that info in class from that presentation and will be tested on it later never happened to me for any class. Nor would I want it to, as it&#x27;s just B (by nature of students teaching via prepared presentation) with the variation that it&#x27;s even less work for the teacher because the student is doing the teaching. The times I learned from my fellow students (or they from me) were in study/homework sessions outside of class where we went over the source material, our notes, other sources, and talked to each other to try and explain what our teacher&#x27;s lecture didn&#x27;t.

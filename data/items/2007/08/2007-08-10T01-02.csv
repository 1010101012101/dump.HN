Problem: we're both an open source love-fest organisation <i>and</i> a business. :-)<p>From our help: ""microPledge has intentionally arranged the fee structure to encourage free software.

It's not as bad as a completely random town in the middle of the country.<p>The weather's pretty bad though. I was surprised to read a few years ago that Pgh was one of the least sunny towns in the country.  Then I realized why as a kid I associated sun with being on vacation: when we were on vacation, we were in other places, and everywhere else was sunny by comparison.",1186709641

41102,comment,41065,41065,0,0,staunch,,,"Congratulations. I'm paying close attention and hope things go well for you guys. I'll be promoting this at the earliest opportunity.<p>Couple things I noticed:<p>1. It's not clear what's in it for microPledge. You should be open about the fact that you're a business and not an open source lovefest organization.<p>2. Those JPEGs on main page should be replaced with GIF/PNG. The artifacts are nasty.<p>3. Might want to change the humorous text on ""I agree"" checkbox to just say ""I consent to the agreement"" otherwise you're possibly weakening your legal protection.<p>
Also, you might want to monitor/search some mailing lists and _very_ tactfully suggest microPledge as a solution to ""we don't have time to do that feature now/its not a priority"" situations.

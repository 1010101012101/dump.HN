[by the way 81 cents on the dollar is the amount women earn annually compared to men, not sure if that needed explanation]<p>Anyway, here's my opinion on the subject.  I had a very bright economics teacher in collage who had many terribly enlightening stories [read most boring but some nuggets of pure gold].  Among them, he said once that some people just arn't cut out for owning a business.  Anyone can operate a business, just not many people can deal with the amount of risk associated with owning a business.  This teacher likened it to being able to sleep at night knowing there was a chance however small that your company would burn down that night. Some people just can't do it.<p>Anyway, this article pretty much gave a very long list of reasons why to AVOID starting a company.  Mainly, because its hard, there is a great deal of risk, oh yeah and its really hard.<p>Why do women seldom start companies?  Why are there seldom women firefighters?  I don't know, because its a damn dirty job and they just don't want to do it.  Nothing wrong with that, plenty of men don't want to be firefighters and for that matter entrepreneurs.  Its stressful, its hard, and just as often as you hear about facebook hitting it big you can count off dozens of companies that fail every year.<p>The question isn't why don't we have more women, the question is why do we have so many men?",1296091981

There are some facial technologies that can ""work"" from a distance (and they are used in airports already), but the success rate is low and the original image still needs to be of decent fidelity. Often times the results from the automated matching will be shortlisted for comparison by human operators.

To me, it is highly likely that your customers don't like your customer service.<p>I have hated every single landlord I've ever had.  They have no online payment systems.  I can't lodge tickets easily.  I have no transparency if work is being done, if my ticket is moving.<p>The reason your customers whine is because they LIVE in those properties.  You're making a fair chunk of money from having someone live there, and for the most part it seems the estate agents just want to take their cut and have the customers leave them alone.<p>It's so prevalent that I now assume it's the default case for real estate:  sucking.",1296090352

You'll see lots of restaurants hit with a failing number of points, then they get the mandated follow-up visit the next week which they ""clean"" up their act and get an A (and all its privileges). I want to know if the restaurant I'm eating at is one of those so that I can make an informed decision and possibly avoid it.

The periodic table looks the way it does because it's about the <i>relationships</i> between the different elements organized spatially on the page. Because of that, it also lets us <i>predict</i> elements we haven't discovered yet! Amazing!<p>There's really no reason that the relationship between typography, dessert, vegetables, google apis look anything like the relationship between the elements. If it did, we'd really be on to something!<p>But! If the relationships between google apis isn't at all like the elements, what would it look like? And even more interesting, if there are missing spaces, that means there are google apis not yet written that we can look forward to!<p><a href=""http://www.ozonehouse.com/mark/periodic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ozonehouse.com/mark/periodic/</a><p>Is an example where someone did a periodic table that tried to use space as a way to convey information about the relationship between the perl operators. Notice how it looks nothing like the PTofE. It has its own structure because the relationship between perl operators is different than the relationship between the elements.<p>Those of us that are sticklers about this feel so, probably because we find the beauty of the actual meaning behind the structure of the periodic table much much more interesting and beautiful than any joke you can make from it.<p>Sometimes, jokes are funny because they're the truth that no one wants to say. Like when Chris Rock says, ""[When listening to your woman], you've always got to throw in 'told you that bitch crazy', because every woman has another woman at their work, that they can't stand""<p>Other times, jokes are funny because one doesn't know any better. Like when Chris Rock says, ""If they can send a space shuttle to the moon, why can't they make an El Dorado with a bumper that doesn't fall off?""",1296090000

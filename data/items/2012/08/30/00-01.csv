4452321,comment,4452005,4452005,3,0,chamakits,,,"I don't doubt that Google is a very public and very popular target for those looking to breach insecure systems.  Having said that, I've heard this ""we are the ones that need this the most"" sort of argument that they use to justify their in house network authentication by many other companies in many different scenarios.  However, most of the time, the problem they are having applies to just about everyone else in the field they are a part of. Which is why open source development has been so successful.  Many with the same problem, helping to implement a common solution, instead of a custom one for each of them.  So I wonder, what are the deficiencies of other existing 'network authentication' solutions out there?  Why couldn't they help improve those?  Why not contribute whatever improvements they've mode to this area?",1346288390

However, if you rely heavily on clicking menus, learning keyboard shortcuts can be a really good time-saver.<p>And the second argument against this ""smart"" (or maybe legacy?) menu placement: In some applications menus have sub-menus, and sub-sub-menus, etc. And it is impossible to put all sub-sub-...-menu items on the top menu bar, so you have to click many times in different parts of the screen anyway. (Oh, yes, this is not an issue for a program with simple menu, but then the keyboard shortcuts can be the way to go).<p>So, there are many shades of ""correct"", I think.

There is an entire ecosystem of productivity enhancement out there that's missing from the GIMP, at least from the professional photographer's point of view, that, absent a coding pro photographer scratching his own itch, probably isn't going to be filled. Selling a $200 plugin for a $600 program to reduce image turn-around times by an hour apiece works in the pro world; selling a $200 plugin for a free program to people who have essentially all of the time in the world to do things the hard way is a fool's game. That's a sort of chicken-and-egg problemuntil there is sufficient pro adoption of the GIMP, the tools won't be there; and until the tools are there, there won't be a large-scale pro adoption of the GIMP. (A wedding photographer, for instance, may have 200300 images from a wedding that ""make the cut"" for the album and slideshow, and need editing. Spending even ten minutes per image on skin is a week's work somebody has to do and somebody has to pay for.

In other words, the purpose of even sanctioning patents is\nso that people would have incentives to go out and invent things. The assumption is,\nthat absent a patent, folks will sit on their bums and not invent anything. \nWith a patent, the inventor can profit, but so does society. If there is no benefit to society, \nwhy allow the patent?<p>Until relatively recently (the 1980's?), software patents were virtually nonexistant. Did that\nstop ""inventions"" in the world of software? That's laughable, since that was the time of\nimmense creativity, new companies, products, inventions. To me that is PROOF that patents \nin software are hardly needed to ""promote the progress of Science and the useful Arts"". Think\nof all the software companies that came of age in the 1980's  and 90's. WITHOUT patent\nprotection (for the most part). WHY allow software patents? For what purpose? \nThe only reason I can see is to benefit the legal profession. And large companies.<p>In addition, software patents have a number of flaws, mostly due to practicalities\nderiving from the <i>ease</i> with which software designers can conjure up new techniques,\nvisual elements, user-interface designs, wire protocols, languages,database designs, and \nthe like. Software is a ""soft"" science - it doesn't require expensive \nlaboratories or extensive field trials.\nIt is playing in a virtual world. You can sit in your room and without spending millions\nof dollars, come up with amazing things. But so can the person across the street or around\nthe globe! And they do! So MUCH of what is ""patented"" are just ""obvious"" takes or re-takes\nof what already abounds, or <i>would</i> abound, should someone else in a room have to solve\nthat same problem. Many patents are <i>not</i> novel, complicated, unusual. Clever, maybe. \nBut someone else in the same circumstance might come up with the same exact thing. \nWhy should the first person be granted 20 years of ""protection""?<p>IF we were to allow software patents at all, say, for truly novel, complex things (yet\nto be determined how you would define this), we should limit the term - to say, 3 years.\nSo yeah, go patent your ""One Click"" or your ""Bouncy Screen"" - if approved (dubious for these),\nyou would have only 3 years to profit from your exclusive deal. Far fewer patents would be\napplied for. Far less litigation.<p>And software designers and companies could create great things and compete on what they\nare offering, and not who they are suing.

Other times the problem is fixed by simply adding indexes to some table.<p>This is a terrible situation I don't want to run into.<p>I have a feeling MongoDB might also suffer from a smilar problem, because it doesn't have cached map-reduce views; it has a query language.<p>In CouchDB, views are pretty much indexes, and they're pretty much the only way to do a query. I'd argue that because it's explicit like that, it's easy to reason about.",1346284875

The smart money[1] is on Obama being re-elected, but likely not by the same margin as he saw in 2008...when he won 52.9% of the popular vote. However, it's too soon to tell what the effects of a couple developments will be:<p>1. A systematic effort in 'swing' states (the states that are not predictably behind one candidate or another) to disenfranchise as many poor and minority voters (traditionally reliably voting blocs for Democratic candidates, such as Obama) as possible by implementing stringent new voter ID laws just months before the election (<a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/03/how-voter-id-laws-are-being-used-to-disenfranchise-minorities-and-the-poor/254572/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/03/how-vote...</a>). The nominal purpose of this is to prevent voter fraud, but between 2002 and 2006 there were only <i>86</i> convictions related to voter fraud out of 200 <i>million</i> votes cast (<a href=""http://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/policy_brief_on_voter_identification/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/policy_brief_o...</a>). Another (self-described conservative) source indicates the number as being 400 in the last ten years (<a href=""http://www.theamericanconservative.com/sore-losers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theamericanconservative.com/sore-losers/</a>).<p>2. A relentlessly negative and admittedly not-reality-based campaign from the Romney campaign to re-litigate welfare reform, which hasn't been a real issue in <i>sixteen</i> years, since Clinton gutted the system (<a href=""http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/08/peter-edelman-mitt-romney-welfare-reform-attack.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/08/peter-edelman-mit...</a>)<p>Also, please note that a poll conducted last year indicated that <i>25%</i> of Americans believed that Obama was born outside the United States and, therefore, ineligible to be President[2]:<p><pre><code>    While 25 percent of all Americans in this new poll say\n    Mr. Obama was born outside the U.S., 57 percent correctly\n    said he was born in the United States. Another 18 percent\n    said they did not know where he was born.\n</code></pre>\nTo say that the United States has a massively uninformed electorate would be an understatement[3]. And the problem is getting worse now that the US Supreme Court allowed corporations and high net worth individuals to anonymously contribute unlimited amounts of money to so-called 'SuperPACs'. SuperPACs are supposedly not allowed to coordinate directly with the candidate(s) they support, but that doesn't matter for two reasons:<p>1. Their ads are overwhelmingly negative[4], and it doesn't take a genius to figure out how to run attack ads against the opponent.<p>2. The 'firewall' between candidates and the SuperPACs is so narrowly defined that it might as well be non-existent[5].<p>[1] 538, TPM, Sam Wang at Princeton, etc. etc. I can provide citations if necessary.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20056061-503544.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20056061-503544.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/nov/09/brains-and-ballot-boxes-electorate-uninformed-ever/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/nov/09/brains-and-ballo...</a> -- my favorite quote: <i>And heres where its interesting, and a little scary.

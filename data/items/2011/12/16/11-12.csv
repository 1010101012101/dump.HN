If it did, third-generation Chinese immigrants would be more Chinese than American.<p>The problem here is that culture determines gender.  Some cultures have two, some three, some even have more.  Many cultures treat children as genderless and initiate them into genders in rites of passage.  In some cases gender is contextual, so among the Norse and among the Greeks, there was a specific gender-based stigma attached to being the penetrated partner in male-male sex.  Male-male sex was not stigmatized, only crossing the gender line and being penetrated as a woman.<p>I think it is a grave error to look at one's own culture and assume that it is biologically determined.<p>As for the ""gay problem"" we have to recognize at some point that every culture addresses human sexuality differently, and human sexuality is remarkably malleable.  For example there are tribes in Papua which make young boys give oral sex to tribal elders as a part of a rite of passage as a way of them literally ingesting manliness in order to become men.<p>Once we look at our own sexual taboos involving who and what we are forbidden to have sexual relations with, and we recognize that these are socially contextual, not innate taboos, things change a great deal.",1324036279

Sure, a lot of people can write code which kind of 'works', that's not really what I would call programming (and I don't think anyone here). As it takes about 10 years to really master writing great code and then get a lot of experience in the trenches, I believe this process is hard and takes a lot of time. Less than learning design. And you can do IA design even though you cannot make things pretty; a lot of people have a feeling for it.<p>If I (programmer, no design education or talent whatsoever) sit down with a pen and paper and draw a user interface (1 page) 100 times, the 100th time, it'll be quite optimal, consistent and nice. After that it goes through the pretty machine, an artist who cannot do IA, but can do pretty. It's a great combi. With programming, you cannot really do the same trick; you'll end up with crap.<p>I do agree that it an be a greater catalyst than pure engineering. I don't think it can be much of anything without engineering and value and that was the author his point. Of course when you made a product you want to make it look good and work well ergonomically, but you want the value and the engineering in place first.

Hashes and arrays are totally different in the Ruby implementations I know of.<p>EDIT: Sorry, I misread you. Ruby MRI and CPython are indeed similar.<p>At least in Ruby MRI (the mainline) arrays are implemented as a struct with a size and a pointer to a normal C array which contains the object references (references in MRI are pointers to object structs which use the lower bits to inline integers of <= 31 or 63 bits, true, false, nil and symbols).<p>Hashes in MRI I have not looked that much into but I believe they are a hash tables which in ruby 1.9 retain insertion order using pointers like a singly linked list.",1324034765

3360369,comment,3359433,3359787,5,0,dchest,,,"Lua is actually closer to PHP in how arrays are used in it.<p>""Until Lua 4.0, tables were implemented strictly as hash tables: all pairs were\nexplicitly stored. Lua 5.0 brought a new algorithm to optimize the use of tables\nas arrays: it optimizes pairs with integer keys by not storing the keys and storing\nthe values in an actual array. More precisely, in Lua 5.0, tables are implemented\nas hybrid data structures: they contain a hash part and an array part. Figure 2\nshows a possible configuration for a table with the pairs ""x""  9.3, 1  100,\n2  200, 3  300. Note the array part on the right: it does not store the integer\nkeys. This division is made only at a low implementation level; access to table\nfields is transparent, even to the virtual machine. Tables automatically and dy-\nnamically adapt their two parts according to their contents: the array part tries\nto store the values corresponding to integer keys from 1 to some limit n. Values\ncorresponding to non-integer keys or to integer keys outside the array range are\nstored in the hash part.<p>When a table needs to grow, Lua recomputes the sizes for its hash part and\nits array part. Either part may be empty. The computed size of the array part\nis the largest n such that at least half the slots between 1 and n are in use\n(to avoid wasting space with sparse arrays) and there is at least one used slot\nbetween n/2 + 1 and n (to avoid a size n when n/2 would do). After computing\nthe new sizes, Lua creates the new parts and re-inserts the elements from the\nold parts into the new ones. As an example, suppose that a is an empty table;\nboth its array part and hash part have size zero. If we execute a[1]=v, the table\nneeds to grow to accommodate the new key. Lua will choose n = 1 for the size\nof the new array part (with a single entry 1  v). The hash part will remain\nempty.""<p>From ""Implementation of Lua 5.0"" -- <a href=""http://lua.org/doc/jucs05.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lua.org/doc/jucs05.pdf</a>",1324034601

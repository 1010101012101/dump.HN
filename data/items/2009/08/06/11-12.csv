Our ranking algorithm builds a large subgraph around an item and then does a few passes with a couple different ranking schemes to try to figure out the hot items within that subgraph, prunes ""noisy"" connections (i.e. links that are ""hot"", but don't actually pack much semantic meaning) and then tries to scale things so that the results returned aren't simply those with the largest overlap, but those that are most relevant within that subgraph relative to the larger graph.  In that sense, it has some similarities to web-search algorithms.<p>In user-visible terms, that means that our results are often less obvious than Amazon's recommendations -- for a long time we called that the ""tell me something I don't know"" problem.  It's no good to do a search for ""Miles Davis"" and have ""Jazz"" com back as a related item.  If you know about Miles Davis, you already know about Jazz.",1249559603

It really depends on how you decide to use it - for me, its an excellent container format once you have coded a little controller-view abstraction.<p>For example for a music-editing software project (internal, not publically released) I once used SVG as the <i>primary</i> User interface description language, with nodes named according to the verbs and objects in the UI paradigm, with the DOM structure being modified from a C++ application as needed depending on realtime input from the user.<p>It works fabulously for this .. All I had to do was provide a dictionary of key node names to a UI designer, tell them ""whatever you call a 'dial' has to have a 'needle', and then it will work for all controls that are using your dial skin"", and hey-presto: instant UI appeal!  Without any major coding changes it was possible to have very fresh, very appealing user interfaces built up by artists overnight .. and another thing I found interesting was that those artists I worked with that understood that the Node Editor was the primary interface to my program, were able to get really nice stuff done, fast, and with enthusiasm.. whereas those who complained that SVG wasn't Illustrator and that they were /never/ going to learn Inkscape to build the GUI and that I had to learn to use 'the real tools .. like Illustrator' .. well, that was just a waste of time.<p>So my personal experience with SVG has been superb .. I really think its an excellent data form for design user interfaces and, given the appropriate strategy for how to lay out SVG nodes in a manner that makes sense (hint: group), it can be very fun for artistic/creative hats to participate directly in the skinning of an application ..",1249556686

The article then talks a lot about Optimizely. However, Optimizely doesn&#x27;t actually use the Z-test - they have a sequential testing method instead, and the details are a bit different.<p>The article also suggests &quot;start by serving variant B to only 10% of the users to ensure there are no implementation problems&quot;. This is a good idea, but once you&#x27;ve ensured there are no integration problems you need to throw away the data and restart. Since conversion rates change during the week (i.e., sat != tues), keeping the data during the ramp-up period is a great way to get wrong results due to Simpson&#x27;s Paradox.",1454673462

If you are using them as keys for large data sets this might be a concern, especially if you are using them in a clustering key in SQL Server or similar because every non-clustered index entry would include the larger value too (a table with four extra indexes: that is 40 extra bytes per row if you have a UUID clustering key over a 64-bit integer, 60 extra compared to a 32 bit integer - if you have many millions or billions of rows that is worth considering).<p>* Unless using some tweak such as SQL Server&#x27;s sequential UUIDs they result in significant fragmentation (assuming a b+tree index structure with allocation and cleanup semantics similar to SQL Server, other DBs may manage things differently) due to their effective randomness, which wastes storage space & memory and can therefore impose greater IO and RAM load beyond that implied by the difference in size.<p>UUIDs are great when you genuinely need them, but often an integer type is much more efficient so refrain from using them where you don&#x27;t have a specific need to.<p>The article and the services described are definitely satire though.",1454672144

Whether or not utilization is a major factor I can&#x27;t really say. For Cuneiform, we have assumed that the major obstacle for using platforms like Hadoop or Spark directly is that these systems require a library to have a Java or Scala interface. If your software is written in, say, Python you need to either<p>- write a wrapper (an approach taken by Crossbow [1], SeqPig [2], or BioPig [3])<p>- reimplement (an approach taken by CloudBurst [4] or ADAM [5])<p>Reimplementing a whole pipeline represents a huge upfront cost. Writing wrappers is more feasible and, accordingly, a huge amount of custom tailored pipelines and ad-hoc worklfow systems have emerged recently. So if it boils down to wrapping libraries and running them on Hadoop, then we need to make this as easy as somehow possible. Cuneiform is a step in this direction.<p>[1] <a href=""http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/crossbow/index.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/crossbow/index.shtml</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/1/119.long"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/1/119.lo...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/09/10/bioinformatics.btt528"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/...</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2682523/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2682523/</a>\n[5] <a href=""http://bdgenomics.org/projects/adam/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bdgenomics.org/projects/adam/</a>",1454672021

11040700,comment,11036554,11039938,0,0,happywolf,,,"I agree with the first paragraph.<p>The second paragraph hinges on the rationale that if customer data were available, then CS (Customer Service) agents would have made every effort to contact the ops/engineering team to retrieve those to avoid a social disaster.<p>Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t true in the companies that I worked for, which are big customer-facing MNCs.<p>First of all, for US consumers, the CS teams most likely are contractors in Philippines, Malaysia, or India, they are trained with scripted responses. For any issue that is beyond the scripts, their standard response will be &quot;Sorry we can&#x27;t help you because we can&#x27;t do x&quot;, one reason is they have no incentive to escalate the issue and get oneself more work to follow up, other times, it is the management explicitly decided this is to prevent too many cases hit the ops and eventually, the engineering teams. It is not that the management is stupid or nasty, just that the 20:80 rule dictates 80% of the issues usually are raised by 20% of particularly picky customers. For the 20% customers who generate 80% of the revenue, each of them will be assigned an AM (Account Manager) who can get things done much faster and more efficient than the CS team. This group of high-value customers are often given access to VPs to make sure all their issues are heard and handled properly<p>Second reason is most teams in a big company will not concern anything that doesn&#x27;t hit them directly. For example the CS team in my ex-company upon getting repeated complaint on an erratic component that didn&#x27;t get bug fix for months, eventually the CS told the upset customer to fuck off and complain to CEO directly since it was engineering department&#x27;s fault.<p>Unbelievable?

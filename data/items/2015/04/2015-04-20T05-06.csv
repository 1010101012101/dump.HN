Basically set on a colony ship, where people have strange psychic powers, investigating sudden deaths that the regimented ship&#x27;s society covers up.  It might be better as an anime though.<p>The First 15 Lives of Harry August by Claire North requires almost no cgi, just period stuff and practical effects.  Basically everytime certain people die, they are born again and remember their whole life. Of course someone decides to change the future.<p>In the Country of the Blind by Michael Flynn is about people who use statistical processes to predict the future, starting before lincoln.  It could make good tv, especially with the steam punk element.  Nice way to talk about machine learning and big data.<p>The Chronoliths by Robert Charles Wilson.  Basically these large sculptures start getting sent back through time something like 40 years, commemorating a warlord&#x27;s victories.  Really strongly written characters, and a good plot.",1429509462

9406379,comment,9403893,9404173,0,0,lutorm,,,"Having just gotten our PV panel installed on our roof this year, this is fresh in my mind. Of course everyone is doing it -- electricity in Hawaii is <i>insanely</i> expensive. Before we turned on the system, we paid $200/month for power! And this is in a house with no heat and no AC.<p>Do they have to buy the power? Yes, but not without limits. The system is built on &quot;net metering&quot;. Every kWh we deliver to the grid can only go to offset one that we already have or will use.  If your system is so large so as to make you a net producer of energy when averaged over a whole year, you will be giving that away to the utility for free.<p>The rules also limit installation of PV systems to a level that will not exceed the minimum daytime load on the local circuit, exactly because there is nowhere to store the power. So every kWh they get from us is one they would otherwise have to generate to supply to one of my neighbors.<p>It&#x27;s clear that the utility companies aren&#x27;t happy with this. But studies have shown that these &quot;extra costs&quot; the utilities talk about being saddled with are offset by savings to them as well.<p>Solar power typically produces power during times of high power demand, so the net effect of solar is actually to even out the daily load variance. This is good for the utility because they need to make sure they have capacity to handle peak load, even if it&#x27;s only for a small fraction of the time. These &quot;peak power&quot; plants are expensive, because you almost never get to operate them. When PV reduces peak load, they don&#x27;t need these plants and this is a net win for them.",1429508865

9406343,comment,9405646,9405866,0,0,j42,,,"Well, I can&#x27;t speak necessarily for the way you write or view code, but for my process I&#x27;ve found its impact intrinsic and clearly definable.<p>First I should note that I follow a few basic principles/sets of principles when programming loosely-typed imperative languages.<p>1) Single-responsibility for classes and methods, with each method coming in around <= 20 lines.  In total the majority of my classes in enterprise level applications (supporting 100&#x27;s of millions of users & responding to internal events with meta/statistical analysis) rarely grow beyond 200 lines per class. Usually whenever I hit the 2-500 line range I&#x27;ll find that many methods can be logically abstracted to a few core traits in order to take advantage of multiple-inheritances without overcomplicating the central registrar or DI patterns.<p>2) I build an interface before building a class--the interface defines what methods will be available to the application/world context (thinking as per an API interface), as well as what type(s) should be received and what type(s) should be returned.  By type hinting/checking at this stage and ensuring conformance to an interface, you can swap out implementations easily later, as well as have a general map or &quot;spec&quot; before you really start hammering the nails--this helps in staying organize and weeding out bad architecture decisions early.<p>3) I keep these public methods simple, so that I can clearly detect failure points and debug based on input/return types for the &#x27;service&#x27; as a whole, and then I use <i>protected</i> methods internally similarly to data pipes in functional programming; each method is clearly named, has a specific transformation it applies, and acts on a series of (n) objects by mapping transformations vs iterative loops which precludes un-terminated conditionals and other type-juggling weirdness.<p>This all results in software that&#x27;s very concise (IMHO), runs well, and is quite simple to test.  I can inherit any class from a testclass, in order to test the protected data pipes with any sample streams.  I can verify the I/O types for all interfaced methods of the class (via functional tests), and tie it all together neatly in knowing that I can pull up any file and clearly differentiate between what formats/returns/transports data, and what mutates it and/or the &quot;state.&quot;<p>The process is by no means perfect and I continue to learn in my pursuits as do we all, however this structure has worked well for me consistently on the types of large projects where others have failed, and in that context I feel it&#x27;s worth expounding.",1429507856

For instance, you might state that (!x + !y) involves the global reasoning of what the values of (x) and (y) are but is local reasoning otherwise. I&#x27;d argue that actually local reasoning is destroyed until you refactor this code as<p><pre><code>    let x_value = !x in
    let y_value = !y in

I&#x27;m not completely certain that I would say that in all cases. I feel very confident though that it&#x27;s (a) the right default and (b) something that should be used to a far greater degree than most code I see written which more or less demands global reasoning to do anything non-trivial at all.",1429507271

I don&#x27;t really think this is as trivial a problem as people seem to think it is.<p>As for the situation of selling power back to the grid, I would argue the solar users are still the customers. The power companies don&#x27;t want it because the changes need to be paid for by current customers but only benefit ex-customers. The solar users are using the grid as a giant battery and an insurance policy for cloudy days.<p>If the power companies are paying what they charge, then the laws of physics say they are losing money due to losses to heat, etc. So of course their margins are higher on their power.",1429506496

Here&#x27;s an example that doesn&#x27;t look very opt-in to me&quot;</i><p>I believe the police commissioner of NYPD has sufficient power and influence to be heard in any number of venues (and, any time he holds a press conference, the world shows that I&#x27;m right in this assertion). I believe it is protecting privilege to insist he be heard when there are thousands of voices in the neighborhoods he has pledged to protect who those in power have refused to hear for <i>decades</i>. The time for the police commissioner to speak on issues of police abuse might be over...it might be time to hear somebody else talk about it, even if they have to be rude and yell to be heard.<p><i>&quot;To not admit this possibility would be hubris of the worst kind.&quot;</i><p>On that, we are agreed. So why do we hear predominantly from police and representatives of police when police kill someone? I think our difference of perspective comes from the idea that everyone has equal access to &quot;free speech&quot; and so we should listen to everyone equally. But, that&#x27;s not the reality we live in. The police commissioner, the mayor, the attorney general, etc. all have a vastly disproportionate amount of access to &quot;free speech&quot; that people of color who are their victims do not have.<p><i>&quot;That many on the left can&#x27;t see this is a great modern, political tragedy.&quot;</i><p>I am not on the left, though I can see how it might appear that way in this particular conversation.<p><i>&quot;They would achieve so much more if they did.&quot;</i><p>I believe they&#x27;d also achieve so much more if they had the resources of those in power. But, they don&#x27;t. So, they work with what they&#x27;ve got. And, sometimes all they have is the ability to shut shit down (and then go to jail for it, because that&#x27;s how this system responds to criticism from those with the least access who resort to direct action out of desperation).",1429506300

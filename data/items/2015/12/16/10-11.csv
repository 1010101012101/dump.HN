In reality, electronic voting is <i>guaranteed</i> to fail far more often tan simple hand counting paper ballots. Even worse, the complexity of electronic voting allows damage to amplify. There s only so much damage someone can do to a paper ballot or <i>local</i> group of ballots. Once you involve networked computers, there is the risk that an attack to affect the entire system.<p>What is the benefit, anyway? Very slightly faster results? Do we add all that risk, cost, and complexity so the media can have their show a bit earlier? The supposed benefits are not important.<p>Electronic voting should be met with extreme suspicion.

It&#x27;s only a context-dependent difference, and this difference is quantitative, even if we still don&#x27;t have a good enough definition of what those quantitative variables underlying them are. You must have a really &quot;fractured&quot; mind not to instantly &quot;get it&quot;. And &quot;INTRINSIC&quot; is simply a void concept: nothing is intrinsic, everything (the universe and all) is obviously observer dependent, it just may be that the observer can be a &quot;huge entity&quot; that some people choose to personalize and call God.<p>It&#x27;s amazing to me that people with such a pathological disconnect between mind and intuition can get so far in life. He&#x27;s incredibly smart, has a great intuition, but when exposed to some problems he simply can&#x27;t CONNECT his REASON with his INTUITION. <i>This is a MENTAL ILLNESS and we should invest in developing ways to treat it, seriously!</i><p>Of course that &quot;the room + person + books + rule books + scratch paper&quot; can be self conscious. You can ask the room questions about &quot;itself&quot; and it will answer, proving that it has a model of itself, even if that model is not specifically encoded anywhere. It&#x27;s just like mathematics, if you have a procedural definitions for the set of all natural numbers (ie. a definition that can be executed to generate the first and the next natural number), you &quot;have&quot; the entire set of natural numbers, even if you don&#x27;t have them all written down on a piece of paper. Same way, if you have the processes for consciousness, you have consciousness, even if you can&#x27;t pinpoint &quot;where&quot; in space and time exactly is. Consciousness is closer to a concept like &quot;prime numbers&quot; than to a physical thing like &quot;a rock&quot;, you don&#x27;t need a space and time for the concept of prime numbers to exist in, it just is.<p>His way o &quot;depersonalizing&quot; conscious &quot;machines&quot; is akin to Hitler&#x27;s way of depersonalizing Jews, and this &quot;mental disease&quot; will probably lead to similar genocides, even if the victims will not be &quot;human&quot; ...at least in the first phase, because you&#x27;ll obviously get a HUGE retaliation in reply to any such stupidity, and my bet it that such a retaliation will be what will end the human race.<p>Now, of course the Chinese room discussion is stupid: you can&#x27;t have &quot;human-like consciousness&quot; with one Chinese room. You&#x27;d need a network of Chinese rooms that talk to each other and also operate under constraints that make their survival dependent on their ability to model themselves and their neighbors, in order to generate &quot;human-like consciousness&quot;.",1450260541

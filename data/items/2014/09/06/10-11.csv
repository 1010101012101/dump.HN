You add features that you wouldn&#x27;t otherwise, because they make that job easier, and then they remain as ugly warts for the rest of the language&#x27;s life.<p>Also, compilers are a particular subset of programs - they&#x27;re pure functions.

I know it&#x27;s a dream to be your own boss and work from home and so on, but as a consultant (or contractor or freelancer, or whatever term we currently decide sounds most important and impressive), you will accrue the kind of finances that mean you can take very long holidays if you want, during which you can work on your own apps, or do nothing at all.  Yes, you have to work for clients the rest of the time, and clients are often mercurial, but - especially if you&#x27;re pitching yourself as a mini-agency who can take care of development, design, and even some strategy (subcontracting the bits you don&#x27;t want to do, as appropriate) - really you often have a lot of freedom; and remote working is definitely becoming more common.<p>I just can&#x27;t comprehend why someone would take such huge risks with potentially such limited returns (eg. months where this guy was making $100), having to learn the bizarre vagaries of &quot;App Store Optimisation&quot; (which I&#x27;m not really convinced isn&#x27;t much more than a lottery anyway, and is hardly a core competency for many developers), when the same strong technical skills you already possess can guarantee you a fantastic income.",1410001089

Alice generates a public/private key pair and gives the public half to Bob. When Bob wants to send mail to Alice, Bob uses the public key Alice gave him. If Alice receives spam, she marks the public key it was encrypted with as &quot;fuck it, the spammers got it&quot; and never receives mail with that key again. Then she notifies Bob that the key he had has been compromised and sends him a new one. Alice could then, after Bob has lost her key to spammers one too many times, simply decide not to talk to someone like him.<p>This would give mailing list operators a large incentive never to share your email with anyone, otherwise you could just block them forever.<p>On the flip side, if the mailing list is really important to you, the operator could reject your new key and tell you you&#x27;ll either receive their spam or you won&#x27;t be part of the mailing list.

Basically human ear can get far more information from a reflection than what one can get from it by eyes.<p>Eventually you could do Non Destructive Evaluation better by just listening to the data and not just looking at it &quot;Sir, this weld sounds wrong&quot;.<p>But alas, IT pays more so that thing was buried on that lab :)",1409997877

I can see an &quot;upload and print&quot; feature on FedEx website, I can see a dedicated mobile app that apparently can print files via FedEx...<p>... but what I was looking for is something that pretends to be a normal printer, so when i do File->Print in Word or Photoshop, I can choose it as a destination, much like we used to do with &quot;PDF printers&quot;, which were programs that installed as printers but outputed PDF files, back in times when MS Office couldn&#x27;t do PDF export.<p>So if I&#x27;m missing an obvious hyperlink to <i>that</i>, could you please help me out here and post it? ;).<p>In general, I <i>don&#x27;t want</i> print shops to start making mobile apps or (even worse) desktop apps to &quot;streamline the process&quot; (i.e. scare the shit out of the living with crappy UI and &quot;upselling opportunities&quot;). My dream is for them to integrate <i>into</i> the system, like every self-respecting piece of consumer hardware does. In the end, I might even not care at all which print shop is doing the job (much like I don&#x27;t care where I order Asian cousine - those restaurants are all commoditized - I only care about it to be hot, tasty and delivered on time). In a perfect world, I&#x27;d love to have it reduced to a single argument, a drop-down in printer settings dialog (but I&#x27;d happily accept a system printer per printing shop for now).",1409997783

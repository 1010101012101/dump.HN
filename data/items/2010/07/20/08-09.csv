To suggest they are ""consumers of child pornography"" is just a bit rude...<p>For the untrained eye such photo's as in this case may have shocked him/her and prompted the knee-jerk reaction of calling the police. You are right in part; I think the main problem is that, absurdly, any images of naked children are starting to worry people. Part of that is founded in fact; you will find people with thousands of images of different children running around naked on beaches/parks/camping trips. But, clearly, in this case it is just a family camping trip and the clerk has either refused or is unable to process that.<p>I recall that a few years ago I was taking pics at a family wedding and happened, while taking shots of my cousins running round playing, to take a shot which included my youngest cousin doing a handstand with her skirt over her head. It was a completely innocent picture; and if I was ever investigated for CP it would never be flagged as CP - but my Aunt was absolutely insistent I should delete the photo.<p>And that is the sort of society we live in.",1279615604

Especially considering their children are 3 and 8 yo? Even in cultures much much more loose about alcohol, most don't give it to children in the single-digit age range. Hell, even if there were no laws and regulations on the stuff, I'd be <i>extremely</i> uneasy giving a child that young alcohol, unless it was just a taste.

That way, those who report cases of abuse of questionable merit, simply to err on the side of mandatory reporting laws, might feel less pressure to do so. In our case, maybe the responding officer, who initially commented that he didn't find the pictures pornographic, would have dismissed the case at the drugstore and not reported us to child services.</i><p>This is the key takeway - and the thing that really needs to change.<p>In this case, like some many others, the process really broke down at that point.<p>But it is incredibly difficult, I imagine, to make such a call.

The ones I've worked with had clients we installed on our servers, but I believe they were just wrappers for encrypted web services. The whole process is complicated by two things: regulations about user information (particularly credit cards), and international credit cards.<p>Storing credit card numbers - some countries have regulations around online transactions. Simply not storing the numbers (or only the last 4 digits, for auditing) was fine for us (Australia FYI). I think the alternative was a number of encryption schemes. We also had to do an expensive audit of our network/website security (because of our revenue? I can't remember).<p>International customers/cards - take this with a grain of salt (we were mostly targeting domestic users), but I believe this depended on your gateway and bank.

It is fscked up that people have to take that attitude, yes, but if you don't want to end up in a big mess, it's a legitimate position. People are hysterical about sexual abuse of children. I don't know what it is. They are all manipulated into it one way or another, I don't really get it.<p>I agree that this is sad. I agree that parents should be able to take pictures of kids running around and playing, even if the children are naked.<p>But the thing is, especially if you're taking these images to a third party for development, you don't want to give anyone any reason whatsoever to spring this kind of thing on you. Maybe someone at the drug store is best friends with your ex-wife's mom and they think that they can use this to finally put you out of the picture. Maybe someone at the drug store is just utterly unreasonable, as seems to have been the case here, and sees completely innocent photos in a bad light. If you take these on your digital camera and your disk gets confiscated in the course of a search warrant and the police find images of nude children, even if they are completely innocent images, do you think that they won't use that to help their case? Cops assume that they wouldn't be investigating someone if that someone were actually innocent and have a history of vindictiveness, dishonesty, and general nastiness that they justify by that belief.<p>So please understand that no one is advocating the position that you shouldn't be allowed to record images of your own children doing funny things/acting cute/whatever while naked.

This is wrong and possibly illegal""<p>It would be good to clarify if this in fact illegal.  If it is not illegal, than saying that it is wrong is subjective.  In the case of talent acquisitions, the acquiring company has an incentive to focus more compensation to the 'founder-cum-employee' for retention and incentive purposes.

US and UK have central banks who will underwrite illogical levels of debt while (supposedly) maintaining a certain level of credibility; the EU has a galaxy of central banks who, individually, cannot do that any more, and a central bank which is not allowed to even try.<p>I don't like to say this, but the only logical solution is the one put forward (half-heartedly) by Sarkozy: let the ECB be the European FED, a proper central bank with full powers at European level, so that debt can be underwritten by Europe as a whole. The collective credibility of Europe as a huge market and productive force is unquestionable, so this would stop speculative moves and stabilize the system.<p>Unfortunately, Germany is currently led by a chancellor who thinks she's running a Bavarian village, and would rather try to save her cows into a ""safe barn"" than to stop the avalanche from getting into the valley in the first place. This makes it easy for US and UK media to fuel doubt in the Euro, indirectly boosting their own currencies and helping themselves to artificially-low borrowing rates.<p>And I say that as a UK citizen who will eventually benefit from this state of things (through increased public investment, or rather less ferocious cuts by the bunch of aristos currently running the show over here).",1323161465

3318525,comment,3318458,3318458,10,0,danshapiro,,,"Here's the right way to behave, in two simple steps:<p><i>Step 1</i><p>Company management (in this case, the founders) have a fiduciary obligation to get as much money for the company as possible.  In the sale negotiation, they should discuss the price of the company first.  If the  buyer tries to talk about their compensation, they simply decline to engage in the conversation, saying that their obligation is first and foremost to the shareholders, so the company price is the first order of business.  They should negotiate as hard as they can to maximize the value returned to the shareholders.<p><i>Step 2</i><p>Once the company price is set, the management/founders should negotiate the best deal possible for the team - both themselves AND the other employees (don't forget the latter).  The company's already locked and loaded.  There is no reason for the team to hold the screws to the acquirer at this point for maximum value.<p>There are two classic mistakes that get made.  The founder mistake is easy to make, because the company will encourage it: ""How about if we lower the price of the company by $X, and add $X to your retention package?""  This is wrong and possibly illegal (but it's hard to get caught).  Taking this sells out your shareholders and violates your duties as an officer of the company.<p>The second classic mistake is an investor one: thinking the employee compensation belongs to the company.  Employee comp is for future services rendered, not past.  There's no reason the shareholders should get a percentage of the founder-cum-employee's stock grant unless they plan to do part of their work for them.<p>tl;dr: get the best price for your company, then get the best price for yourself and your team.",1323159836

All they want is Firefox Latest. The latest and hopefully best version of Firefox will allow for the fastest and smoothest browsing experience. When I hear FF7/8/9 is out I sigh. Firefox automatically updates now, why all the grand announcements, especially considering for the majority of users the changes between 7 and 8 are fairly irrelevant background changes that won't be noticed.<p>Chrome is on what now? v15?

Really.<p>I understand that this is common in lots of places (here in Tel Aviv recycling seems to be a joke as well), but I think that stinks. I'm not a nutjob or a treehugger, but really, some things should be handled differently (and with care) if you want to dispose it. It's relatively easy to do it on your end (if the relevant education is in place. Talking about dos and don'ts - no offense or derogatory meaning implied) and a hard and messy job on the other side of the trash processing.<p>What would I do in Germany? Well, trash is already separated in special plastic things (the yoghurt you just ate? The container is not trash) and 'normal stuff' (think everything non-toxic that remains).<p>If you want to throw away big things (furniture, TV): Call the municipality, they'll come to your home and get it. For free, a couple of times per year (free is a lie: That service is already paid for by you anyway).<p>Want to throw away smaller things? Batteries? Shops that sell batteries have to take back old ones. Every now and then you'll have the opportunity to drop off small gadgets and related things, usually at a van/truck that goes around (and helps educating about recycling as well).<p>Last option: You can drive up to the (no idea how you'd name this correctly) garbage place and bring your stuff. They'll let you (free of course, with the same caveat from above) dispose everything and show you where to place wood, where you'd drop electrical devices, where metal should end up.<p>It works. Germany's not that small and I don't think it's too much effort for the individual (again: I'm lazy. And not a tree hugger in any way). I know that a lot more countries do comparable things.<p>This law that started the thread? It sounds weird if you have the background described above. It looks like a crappy half-baked idea - neither particularly helpful nor enforceable. And obviously, as you just proved with that question, going against the general public's idea of how to handle your garbage.",1323158429

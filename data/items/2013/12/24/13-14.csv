This value is exchanged for money, which allows the rich to draw back this value as they see fit.<p>Lets imagine that Steve Jobs, instead of getting paid for his iPhones, sold them in exchange for a person&#x27;s time. The average hourly wage in USA is approximately $24, meaning an iPhone would retail for about 25 hours. You can choose not to buy an iPhone, in which case you are free, or you choose to draw this value offered by Steve Jobs, but then you&#x27;d owe him 25 hours of work. The exchange is still completely voluntary, and therefore can&#x27;t constitute domination.",1387893555

Their code needed to be maintainable so they could share it in their academic community, and get things done with it.<p>Today, the people teaching computer science view code as the proof of concept. Much of the work is in the idea behind the code, and the code is just proof that it can be implemented in practice - and most importantly, isn&#x27;t designed to be actually used.<p>The idea that the code is just the proof of concept then carries over to the students, and the mindset becomes not, &quot;let&#x27;s build this thing to do X&#x27;, but &quot;can we build a thing, in way Y to do X&quot;.",1387892177

As my business has grown I&#x27;m happier, but I can see the monetary goalposts shifting as I go.<p>I started two years ago. My initial goal was to build recurring income. I wanted enough to cover expenses, as an initial goal.<p>Achieved that. But I saw I was vulnerable to sudden expenses, or a temporary decline in business. So I wanted an emergency fund.<p>Achieved that. But then I realized I had student loan debt that I would soon have to pay interest on, as I was earning more money and wouldn&#x27;t qualify for debt relief in the near future.<p>Had a really good autumn and achieved that. Then I noticed that I might have to pay more taxes, because my previous tuition tax credits may run out in 2013.<p>Achieved that, which brings me to the present. I only achieved much of that savings through tutoring. I charge a high rate, but it&#x27;s not scaleable. So now my current goal is increasingly recurring revenue so that I don&#x27;t have to sell my time directly.<p>Why am I writing this? At each one of these stages, I had the feeling &quot;If I just achieve this goal, I&#x27;ll have enough&quot;. It was a silly belief in retrospect âÂ it would have been obvious to an outsider that I still had challenges to overcome.<p>Yet presently, I have the feeling &quot;if I double my recurring income, I&#x27;ll have enough&quot;. But I&#x27;m certain that once I achieve this goal, I&#x27;ll see another reason I ought to earn more. Probably the next goal will be &quot;if I just achieve X, I can make work optional by age 33&quot; or &quot;if I just earn X, I won&#x27;t have to worry about the cost of airfare for trips&quot;.<p>I can attest that life IS better now that I&#x27;ve met the goals I listed above. I remember having lots of worries about money that have mostly dissipated. I haven&#x27;t increased my lifestyle, and have been trying to keep &quot;freedom&quot; as the main goal for earning more money.<p>But the whole process feels shockingly short-sighted. It&#x27;s as though I&#x27;m incapable of imagining how I will feel if I am earning $X or have saved $X.",1387892123

But with function types already ruled out and time running short, they decided to make up ad-hoc function types.<p>This is simply not true. Doug Lea, the author of java.util.concurrent, and of ForkJoin in particular, was one of the main driving forces behind lambdas; he requested them about 7 years ago precisely for those bulk operations. The same Doug Lea rejected function types way back then in favor of CICE.<p>Already back in 2007-2008 it became clear that function types are a bad fit for Java. Java&#x27;s designers explicitly mentioned currying, general functional-style programming, and user-defined control structures as <i>things they wanted to avoid</i>. These things may very well have a place in other programming languages, but not in Java. If you don&#x27;t want a blue-collar programming language then Java is simply not meant for you. Java, like Clojure or Haskell, has a very specific flavor. A feature can be right for one language but not for another.<p>> A bit later, they also realized that all the boxing had a non-negligible impact on performance, so they started to add _some_ ad-hoc specializations to the already ad-hoc function types, but of course not _all_ of them. Not even mentioning that the naming is just completely out of whack.<p>Again, not true. Java&#x27;s designers are <i>extremely</i> focused on performance, and did not &quot;realize&quot; all of a sudden boxing has a non-negligible impact on performance. Also, those are not &quot;ad hoc&quot; specializations. All they did was pre-define some small subset of possible function types that they figured will be widely used. Again, the idea is always do the least &quot;powerful&quot; thing possible that will give you the most benefit.",1387891978

The value of a King as 13 and the Queen as 12 is determined by the rules of the card game, not the number of elements displayed on its face as is the case for the non-face cards - e.g. the face cards all have a value of 10 in blackjack.<p>Some languages better allow for the messy details of the world and allow the programmer to treat the partial and occasional isomorphism  between names of and the values assigned to cards in a particular context uncomplected.<p>None of which is to say that strong static typing does not offer a particular set of advantages, only to suggest that it can become forced at a certain level of abstraction where real world objects are represented without a specific context for interpretation.<p>Imagine a program which begins by asking, &quot;Which game do you want to play?&quot; and includes a card guessing game, blackjack, Uno!, go fish, and crazy eights. We want the values of the cards to lie in their use within each game, not where we shuffle and deal and discard from hands.",1387890080

Even if you got 0% on a new car as an incentive and paid 2% on a used car loan, over a 5-6 year loan, you&#x27;d pay about 7% more with the loan vs the &quot;free&quot; financing on the new car. (Nevermind that a 5-6 year car loan is insanely long, IMO; buy a car you can afford for cash or on a 3-4 year note. With money at 2%, that&#x27;s less important than it used to be, of course.)<p>There are also programs where a captive (or semi-captive) credit agency will finance people who couldn&#x27;t qualify for a used car loan. It frustrates me when I hear car ads touting exactly this, which I view as borderline predatory.<p>&quot;With my credit, I couldn&#x27;t afford a car, but FooBar brand got me into a new car for only $95 a week!&quot; I believe that such practices should be legal (because you don&#x27;t generally make someone better off by legislating away their choice), but it&#x27;s not helpful in the majority of cases.

Sometimes face cards are worth 10, other times they are worth 11, 12, 13. If you use <i>val King = 10;</i>, then it suddenly is impossible to distinguish between face cards and tens.",1387890008

5054638,comment,5053812,5053812,3,0,ScottWhigham,,,"While I applaud the work OP put into this, it makes no sense to me. Why?<p>The first thing is that why do this instead of using Google to find out the most popular niche sites? If I type in ""restaurant forum"" in Google, surely the first 4-5 pages will contain useful information, no?<p>Secondly, people have to remember that this list exists when they are thinking of ideas. First thought in anyone's mind is to Google ""restaurant forum"". You aren't going to overcome that line of thinking in this community - you just aren't. The only hope you have is to augment it by providing information that Google doesn't offer. What's the chance of that?<p>Third - let's assume that you get a lot of interest on this thread and people submit 500+ links. Awesome :) Who will take it upon themselves to categorize these and present them in a helpful way? Surely you wouldn't expect anyone to visit a page with 500+ links on it and search one by one through the links to see if one meets his/her needs, would you? If you did a page search for ""restaurant"" on this page, a site like <a href=""http://www.fohboh.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fohboh.com/</a> would not show up b/c it doesn't have a descriptive URL or tagline next to it. So someone has to take this list and make it usable. Who will do that?<p>Fourth - who will curate this list to ensure that only the ""right"" sites are added (rather than someone submitting their own site for SEO purposes)? It would have to be a mod b/c OP cannot edit others' submissions. Can you get a mod to agree?<p>Lastly, who will curate this list over time by adding, removing, and editing it? New sites are always on the horizon and thus will need to be added over time. Current sites will die or fade in popularity. Someone will have to be on top of it. HN doesn't have ""sticky threads"". Even if it gets voted to the front page, it will eventually/soon fade to the 2nd, 3rd, etc. Only a certain number of stories are maintained in perpetuity (at least in the ""More"" button). How will you ensure that it stays alive?<p>Sorry - the ""actual benefits received"" vs. ""how much work will be required"" just makes it untenable to me.",1358171904

A pox on all their houses.  The insight is all three groups like to pretend they're the only group that exists.<p>I would advise that people with addictive personalities probably have a much higher quality of life if they stick to watching TV, pro sports, facebook, and texting, than meth heroin or alcohol.

Girls growing up in the 80s grew up on the fantasy of being like her, chosen and given wealth and fame and becoming a queen. And then she didn't buckle up and the entire childhood fantasy died right there with her in the tunnels of Paris. This trauma has changed England's emotional landscape for good - no more stiff upper lip.<p>So you saying 'Aaron is what I wish I was' is the correct analysis - Aaron had everything that we here strive for - he was recognized for his potential when he was a teenager, he had been accepted by YC, was part of a successful exit, was a highly respected and idealistic Internet activist and intellectual... These are the goals people strive for when they tell themselves 'if I only could achieve XYZ, then I will be happy - I will put all my energy into XYZ, because it will eventually be worth it'. 
The reality is more complex. Even with all these achievements, the highest potential that we can strive for can be destroyed. In his case by the beast of depression when driven by senseless persecution through the political apparatus.",1358171786

A trick play's success rate depends on down number, position on the field, the clock, defensive tendencies, score, weather, field conditions, player injuries, and more. For example, a flea flicker isn't going to be attempted as often in really bad weather, or when you are up by four touchdowns, or when the main player who is the ultimate receiver of the ball (the ""flea"", perhaps?) is out of the game due to injury.<p>So I like this sort of analysis but it's completely useless due to its incompleteness. But I still am glad OP shared because I like seeing all the thoughts, functions, and so forth.",1358171103

Two years after I had started I tried to kill myself, unfortunately it was very clumsy.<p>A few days after the suicide event I got very sick, vomiting for days, and since I was worried about being in pain for the rest of my life, I told someone.  This ended up with me going to the psychologist and then a mental ward after he got worried about me.  This led to me seeing a psychologist who specialized in sexuality.<p>Here is the gist of what he told me:
  * Something made me lose my trust in people.
  * My childhood was totally fucked up.
  * That there was no problem in looking at porn
  * That masturbating to porn made me feel alive after being dead or something to that effect<p>He also gave me the assignment to masturbate every day.  He did say it would be a problem if that was all or most of what I did.<p>It seems to me that it wasn't the porn that was the problem but the guilt I had associated with it, which lead me to remove myself from groups I was involved with then, because I thought I was ""too crap"" and that I was somehow destroying the groups I was in because of subtle differences in my behaviour from masturbating to porn.<p>Another huge problem was that I had made a New Year's resolution which was: get a girlfriend inclusive-or get happy inclusive-or die.  With that I spent some time over the two years before the attempt looking at ways to suicide.  I don't make New Year's resolutions any more.<p>The suicide attempt changed me for life, in that I feel worse, and have no desire to do anything after that, like create music, social things.  Going out to public events just made me angry.  I get angry much more easily now, and have a bit of a facial tick, and are somewhat sexually dysfunctional compared to before.<p>Anyway, it's my opinion that, porn is not a large problem but worrying about it is.  But, that depends, I guess.<p>Note:  I created this account just to reply to this.  I haven't posted before, because I have felt too unqualified.  <i>The main point of the post is what the psychologist told me.</i>",1358169769

5054467,comment,5048301,5050021,1,0,pseingatl,,,"It's quite easy to calculate the likely sentence. The Federal Sentencing Guidelines provide for a base level of 6, plus an 18 step increase for fraud between $2,500,000 and $7,000,000. The sentencing range at this level assuming no criminal history is 57-71 months. Expect supervised release (no computers) for three years. The fine would be up to the sentencing judge within statutory limits. The government estimated the value of the JStor documents at $5 million. Even if the government's estimate was exaggerated, the documents were worth something--and this figure would drive the sentence to be imposed. The judge could also depart upward based on aggravating factors such as PACER and a lack of remorse. Swartz faced with no good choices. When he did not take the offered plea, they superseded and racheted up the counts. The number of counts doesn't really matter for Guidelines purposes but there is always the risk that the sentencing judge could impose the sentences for each count consecutively.<p>My guess is that Heyman/Ortiz really didn't want to prosecute the case, afraid that it would become a political hot potato and controversial. They made him what they considered a reasonable offer in September--7 to 8 months federal prison, a fine (amount unknown) and two-three years of supervised release. The kicker is that he could not use computers until supervised release was finished. So for a decade or so, he would be cut off from the digital world entirely.<p>(There are various reports about these negotiations but I have not seen an offer letter.)<p>We know that Swartz did not accept the offer. What happened next is what prosecutors do in all sorts of cases: they superseded, that is, replaced the indictment with a new one, adding new charges and new counts. Perhaps they withdrew their plea offer as well, or put a deadline on acceptance.<p>With a trial date of this week, and advice from his lawyers that he very well could lose (whatever the facts, the hiding his face with a mask would be a prominent feature of the trial, and mummery by the prosecutors just as the glove in the OJ case).<p>I do not know what his attorneys told him; but from their pleadings they seem to be competent, professional federal defense attorneys, so they would have told him realistically what his chances were. Criminal defendants in these circumstances often take very drastic action.<p>Someone was pressing this case. It could have been Ortiz. It could have been the case agent. It could have been Heyman. In state court a case like this would almost certainly have resulted in probation. Someone, somewhere wanted Swartz' head on their pike.",1358169110

This may be due to my upbringing, which is working class where Tories are generally hated, sometimes irrationally, but I don't think my confusion is irrational.<p>He seems very ignorant, down to the core. This is a man who hasn't lived the working class life, hasn't come close to touching it. He is even descends from royalty.<p>He says his policies are beneficial to the majority of the UK, which simply isn't true. The increase on VAT hit the poorest families hard. The rejig on child support hit the families hard.<p>The problem is that it doesn't seem like he's even aware of these effects and it seems true here too.<p>He says that their current policies are working fine and that it's the right way forward yet ""over-crowded prisons"" have become a meme.<p>It's costing us money to house people in prisons for these crimes. It's costing us money when these people cannot contribute to society, which some may actually would have done if they weren't in prison.<p>I see kids influenced by drug dealers into trying things out. I know this, I was one of them (stupid, I admit). Once they've become accustomed to one thing, something harder is introduced.<p>It just seems extremely ignorant to me.",1358168560

Unfortunately, I'm several months in and the best-selling games are Bejeweled knock-offs, and a $3.99 version of Doodle Jump.  I didn't make my choice of phone platform based upon game selection, but it definitely seems that iPhone developers are focused on building businesses and making money, while Android developers are mainly hobbyists, tinkering on niche projects.<p>To the author's point, if the existing .NET development community can leap-frog Android in terms of app output and app quality, then they would make a believer out of me.",1268996244

The promotion cycle is generally a year or half year, so that's how long you have to show results.<p>This method probably works very well for large scale, non-technical corporates because the aptitude to practice politics successfully would logically have strong correlations with other useful soft work skills (sales, negotiation, social skills).

I agree with most of his points, especially this:<p><i>Technology people tend to vastly overestimate the things that people look at when deciding if a phone is good or not. They care about how polished the outside looks, how thin it is, and how smooth and fast the user interface is. There is really not much more! They don't care about multi-tasking or open source or any of that stuff - they care about how impressed other people are when they look at them using the phone.</i><p>I started with a MyTouch and moved to a Nexus One (which I have now). The more I use Android, the less appealing it becomes. Honestly... who cares that it's open source? It's a novelty.

It doesn't count against your holidays. And you can be out sick as long as necessary. I've heard some being out sick for a 2 months. Reason is the government covers sick days (they reimburse the employer 80%). You will need to see a doctor who will put down how many days you need to recover.<p>So no their isn't a ""pile"" of bankable sick days. Just know if you are sick for too long you go on disability which is a  separate matter I'm not familiar with.",1268993514

1203791,comment,1203696,1203737,0,0,shib71,,,"Here in Australia a ""permanent"" position typically includes around 4 weeks of paid vacation (""annual leave""). The vacation time is accumulated week by week so that if you want to take a long break you need to ""save up"" the time. Vacations can be anything from a single Monday through to months.<p>How this is arranged depends on the company (e.g. large corporations tend towards lots of paperwork) but they all demand a reasonable amount of notice (i.e. more notice for longer vacation periods) as well as some awareness of deadlines and upcoming work.<p>Different companies do have different policies though. For example, that employees use their vacation time within a certain period or lose it. And yes, some have certain times that are set vacations. My company shuts down between Christmas and New Year, and the non-public holidays count as annual leave.<p>In the last six months I have: taken Monday/Friday leave to visit family for an extra long weekend, a two week break to do a course (latin :), and a morning in the middle of the week (with no notice) to wait for a delivery.<p>For contrast: a ""casual"" job has no paid leave. I believe it is also much easier legally for employers to fire casual employees.",1268993299

Given the information that is available at the moment (screenshots, videos, spec sheets), then this particular path is the best to take. I.e, Microsoft can still fuck it up by release a sideways talker or something stupid like that. But I cannot know this at this point in time, and the risk is basically in deciding that if they got this far and were able to come up with something new, then they will also make the final parts of this good.<p>One thing that worries me a bit is the 0.8 second delay when you switch screens. This may make the phone feel slow, and if it slows down over time, then that can kill the phone. But I can't know this now, one just has to take a risk.",1268993182

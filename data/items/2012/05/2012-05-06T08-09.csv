3934581,comment,3934093,3934093,3,0,spodek,,,"To minimize the number of coins and bills people carry, denominations should grow geometrically. Then no one has to carry more than one of each denomination.<p>1 dollar, 2 dollars, 4 dollars, 8 dollars, and so on until you have as high a denomination as you want.<p>half dollar, quarter dollar, eighth dollar, and so on until you have as low a denomination as you want.<p>The mint can make any denomination a bill or a coin. When inflation makes one too small to care about, you can stop making it; if you want, at the same time you can increment at which denominations you stop making coins and start making bills.<p>If inflation makes your bill/coin boundary something weird, like 32 dollars, you might want to create 1 new_dollar = 32 dollars and start again. If your inflation is growing so fast you have to keep devaluing... well, that's another problem.<p>EDIT (to bazzargh's comment): this scheme doesn't obviate stores needing spare coins and bills to make change. If Alice and Bob both have ($1, $4) here or ($1, $5) in old scheme, in neither case can Alice pay Bob $2. I could be missing something, but the new scheme seems no worse than the old in this regard.",1336294699

It's best to do all your error handling at once, at the beginning of the function, rather than mixing it in with your algorithmic code.

Apple has always catered more to the upper end than anything else, but it works for them. Segmenting this end of the market is still a very lucrative proposition for them. Also, the fact that the top selling smartphone in the US is the iPhone meaning they're currently able to cater to the whole of the smartphone market very effectively, not just the upper end.<p>I agree this isn't a good strategy when the 3rd world countries start going strong on smartphones, but that doesn't mean it's not a good strategy now. Perhaps when that happens they will fundamentally have to shift their focus from catering only to the upper end of the market to a broader one, but I don't think that will happen soon enough for them to change their strategy now.",1336292277

3934505,comment,3933217,3933646,17,0,mbreese,,,"Since you bring up Hollywood, there is another theory that might help explain it.<p>With the rise of movies then TV, you had more people seeing men on screen without hats. Why? Because it's difficult to properly light a man's face while he is wearing a hat. The lights must be somewhat above the actors, so a hat causes a shadow across his face. If you want to see the man's face, then he can't wear a hat on camera. So, once you have the trend setters removing hats, then people get more used to the idea of seeing a man's head sans chapeau. News anchors still dress nicely in suits, so they would still be somewhat formal, even without the hat.<p>If this were the case, it would probably start to show the decline of hats earlier than the rise of automobiles, in the 1930's or so, so this theory could be tested separately from the rise of the automobile.",1336291781

Genuinely curious.</i><p>I'm not yummyfajitas nor am I speaking for him.<p>I believe he's looking for a principle somewhere that links people's moral outrage and the law. People either have their principles or they have the law. If people are having an argument about what is moral the law is irrelevant, if they're having an argument about what is moral the law is irrelevant.<p>A consistent argument would be either legal or moral. Any argument that treats the law as having moral weight is assigning some kind of quasi-sacred status to it.<p>Either the PATRIOT Act is legal therefore it is right is an argument that has some weight however tiny XOR it doesn't.<p>Why do you think<p><i>But it's not just ""the Supreme Court decided it and thus it is so"" (although when push comes to shove...).

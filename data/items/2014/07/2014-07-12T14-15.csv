When I run bitcoin-qt on my computer, I have the whole blockchain locally, and I <i>relay</i> blocks created by <i>others</i>, but I do not &quot;maintain&quot; the blockchain in the sense of adding or subtracting from it beyond the transactions I create myself to spend my own money.<p>><i>With the increased difficulty in mining, it&#x27;s very unlikely for anyone without a large investment in hardware, that you&#x27;re ever going to make money on the fees.</i><p>Correct, so I don&#x27;t mine.<p>><i>It provides no incentive to run the full client to help the network confirm transactions.</i><p>Again, &quot;help&quot; is a bit ambiguous. When I run bitcoin-qt, I <i>relay</i> transactions, but I do not contribute any processing power to confirmations. &quot;Confirming&quot; a transaction means including it in a block, an d only miners create blocks.<p>Now, it is a bit of a problem that there is little to no incentive to run a <i>validating</i> client, i.e. one that accepts transactions, verifies that they are cryptographically and monetarily valid, and passes them on to other people. We shall see if another cryptocoin solves this issue.",1405177168

Regardless of the current case, which I certainly don&#x27;t have enough information to comment on, in general rape often inflicts a terrible psychological damage on the victim. And since the rapists are often close to the victim, the act very often doesn&#x27;t have any witnesses or clear evidence, especially if they were romantically involved. And despite what some people might believe in their minds, accusing someone of rape doesn&#x27;t get the town to behind you and the rapist locked up. True victims will be disbelieved, insulted and treated as &quot;damaged goods&quot;.<p>Again, I don&#x27;t know anything about this case. I don&#x27;t know if he did anything wrong.

8024682,comment,8023035,8023679,1,0,taeric,,,"I can see how it helps.  I&#x27;m still curious by how much.  Consider, if everyone&#x27;s common tool chain is untrustworthy, then this solves nothing.<p>This is why the &quot;docker&quot; idea worries me.  It is basically counter productive.  Just moves the &quot;trust&quot; to a whole harder thing to verify.<p>And the reason I was focusing on the compiler point, is to my knowledge nobody has established that the common compilers are trustworthy.  At least not the ones in use at large.  Until that happens, we&#x27;re back to my first point.  Which is to say that we may not be trustworthy.<p>Again, to be clear, I see there is benefit to knowing that we are all of the same trustworthiness.  Having &quot;reproducible&quot; builds that don&#x27;t match is an indication that something is definitely wrong.  Definitely a worthy effort.  Just, having reproducible builds that do match doesn&#x27;t really tell you much about the trustworthiness of the application.  Specifically, it <i>only</i> tells you that it is <i>as trustworthy</i> as another build.  (Similar to the boolean logic that trips folks up all of the time that False \\implies True is true, as is False \\implies False.)<p>Unless, of course, I&#x27;m still misunderstanding something.",1405176791

But if the restaurant isn&#x27;t up-scale enough to use social pressure, there are probably other options.<p>Given that a significant number of customers were requesting wifi access, I wonder if some sort of landing page could be used to encourage the customer to choose something more quickly.<p>Some other subtle tricks might work as well. E.g waiters might give an explicit time frame (&quot;I&#x27;ll check back in 3 or 4 minutes&quot;) instead of the more common open-ended &quot;in a few minutes&quot;/&quot;in a bit&quot;/&quot;later&quot;.<p>It also seems like the &quot;request to be seated elsewhere&quot; problem would be easy enough to solve by allowing customers, when they arrive, to select a table <i>or</i> ask for the soonest available table. I have a feeling most parties would select the latter. And then there&#x27;s an implicit agreement -- whether a table is selected or not -- that the person will sit where the waiter take them.<p>The pictures of food/friends/etc. is annoying and probably not solvable except by social pressure.

And the so called &quot;abuses&quot; are seldom done by some &quot;bad apples&quot;, they are built into the system.<p>><i>The other reason I don&#x27;t believe this HN hivemind theory of politics is that I by no means assume that everyone in politics lacks personal integrity.</i><p>Another case in point. My take is that tons of people &quot;lack personal integrity&quot;, and a certain loss of it is a pre-requisite for a succesful career in politics.<p>But in an a higher level, it&#x27;s also that whether people in politics have &quot;personal integrity&quot; or not is besides the point.<p>The system can operate without integrity, even if most of it&#x27;s players have &quot;personal integrity&quot;.<p>For one, personal integrity is totally compatible with doing bad -- it only requires that you believe that the &quot;bad&quot; has to be done for an ultimately good cause (e.g surveillance and safety).<p>Plus, ethical systems (that guide &quot;integrity&quot;) have many levels, strict conformance to the law and professional ethics is just one of them. For example, a cop that plants evidence on some guy, perhaps does not do it because he &quot;lacks personal integrity&quot; (e.g to pad his arrest record), but because he really believes the guy is guilty and that it&#x27;s his duty as a good guy to put him in prison. That the guy could be innocent, and what he&#x27;s doing is morally wrong, doesn&#x27;t cross his mind, because he is convinced.",1405175645

Small-town bookstores never carried more than a handful of programming books, a couple of short shelves of science fiction, and none of the strange specialist material I buy today (books on purely functional data structures, bilingual French/hieroglyphic texts, and so on—<i>everybody</i> wants something out on the long tail, but the details obviously vary).<p>Right now, my least favorite thing about the French book market is the near-impossibility of buying French-language ebooks from overseas, assuming I want more than <i>Le Petit Prince</i> or a bunch of public domain classics. The only French publishing niche that has this figured out is long-form comics (aka <i>bandes dessinées</i>). There, the publishers banded together to create the massively awesome online distributor Izneo, which sucks up more of my book budget than I&#x27;d care to admit, and which allows me to buy from anywhere in the world: <a href=""http://www.izneo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.izneo.com/</a><p>On the other hand, the French tradition of aggressive law-making means that they can actually decide to create a 4-year startup visa, then go ahead and actually do it.",1405174307

4860944,comment,4860816,4860816,3,0,barrkel,,,"I bought Far Cry 3 the other day, but had some problems playing it. Specifically, there are bugs in the key bindings mechanism, where some vehicles are stuck on the default key maps, even though the keys are configured differently in the preferences.<p>I looked into the key map preferences file, and it's fairly clear how the key mapping is implemented in the game: the defaults are hard-coded in, and ""mapping"" is implemented by basically having a search-and-replace filter on the incoming key stream. It's no wonder there are bugs; it seems that not all places that check for input run the input through the filter. What's missing is an indirection between the concepts of a keystroke and a command.<p>But the particularly revealing thing was when I went onto the Ubisoft forums to discuss the issue. The forum for Far Cry 3 Console has about 15x as many posts as the Far Cry 3 PC forum.<p>If revenues are similarly lopsided, it would explain why the PC version - the HUD and input system in particular - is such a crappy console port. It's because PC players are an afterthought, a minor bit of loose change to pick up after the bulk of the market has been addressed.<p>And in turn, the PC experience, from opening the box to getting the game running, is so unpleasant it turns more and more gamers away from the platform. It's not available on Steam in the UK, so I got the package in the mail. Ubisoft didn't even use proper plastic for the DVD box, it's all floppy and squeezable, like the plastic used for tomato ketchup or mayonnaise bottles. Ubisoft did almost everything they could to show their contempt for PC players.<p>So I am not optimistic for the future of PC games.",1354449490

When I look back on my previous projects, most of them have been written in C++ because that was the only feasible way of doing it I could come up with.<p>For example how could I have done anything of this in another language like C#/Java?<p>- Writing a Video on Demand streaming library that was using the torrent protocol and unicast sockets. Required to be platform independent.<p>- Writing a web browser plugin for all webkit browser and IE that interfaced with OpenNI and Kinect SDK, using ffmpeg to stream RGBD video to a server. The plugin was based on Firebreath which is a C++ library for making portable plugins.<p>- Developing a high-performance iOS/Android app which requires a lot of OpenGL graphics and computer vision algorithms.<p>I don't particularly like C++, but I don't see how anything of this could have been done with another language.

Remarkably successful at that, really.<p>Kinda falls apart in some cases.  For example the standard says with respect to inline functions that:<p>An inline function with external linkage shall have the same address in all translation units.<p>So I guess for the purpose of not having to worry about comparing the values of a function pointer to an inline function or worry about assignment semantics?  Actually I have never really understood the point of this part of the spec.<p>Anyway, the cost of this is not negligible, since the linker has to maintain state for those cases where inline replacement is not an option[0].  As a result, even if you don't use this feature of the language, you pay for it with increased link time and object file sizes.

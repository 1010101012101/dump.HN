You are afraid of what will happen to your job when you reach 40? Ask yourself this: how do you think people managed to live and have a job a hundred years ago when they hit 40 or 50?<p>OK, perhaps this is a cultural thing. I am from eastern Europe where a &quot;normal&quot; annual income, for a single person, can be $12,000. So a couple can bring $24,000 I assume this would be devastating in US. Just like the news the other day with the president of a university (in UK?) where he was complaining of having to deal with an €220,000 annual income.<p>But of course, you are aware of this discrepancy. Otherwise why would these kind of job offerings exist: <a href=""https://www.elance.com/j/wordpress-plugin-theme-developer-month/66087187/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.elance.com/j/wordpress-plugin-theme-developer-mo...</a><p>$300 / month &quot;FULL-TIME wordpress plugin and theme developer from Pakistan and India only.&quot;<p>Please, if you are being laid off at 40 and in the case you are not suffering from a company downsizing, bankruptcy or you don&#x27;t have medical issues (another interesting topic to talk about) it means that you are either an incompetent or a lazy individual.<p>No disrespect, please just wake up from your dream.<p>EDIT: I just realized from the feedback to this message how completely and utterly naive I am to not taking into account that HN is in no way representative of the average worker in US. Here, the absolute majority seems to be only people from IT which don&#x27;t quite appreciate the opportunity and privilege actually to be able to code and think that only > $60,000 salaries are worth their time and effort.<p>Good luck then!",1418554594

Granting this it is evident that Sanguineous animals like snakes, whose length is out of proportion to the rest of their dimensions, cannot possibly have limbs; for they cannot have more than four (or they would be bloodless), and if they had two or four they would be practically stationary; so slow and unprofitable would their movement necessarily be. &quot;",1418554389

How is it dealt with differently?<p>This is probably the case of someone trying hard to come up with at least some downsides. Most transactions are relatively mundane, and for an automated transaction between two bank databases, there is, I think, very little that can be done in a day that cannot be done instantly. The part that screens fraudulent transactions is very likely already automated, I can&#x27;t believe it wouldn&#x27;t be. It&#x27;s probably not even the most common/dangerous type of  fraud.<p>European banks have collective agreements about money transfers with each other.

Let me share one of my personal opinions with no basis in fact: cake is superior to pie, there I said it!<p>>  But what if Brown wasn&#x27;t attacking the officer but defending himself?<p>We actually got into a bit of a debate at dinner discussing if you have the right to defend yourself against an unjust arrest -- short version: &quot;nope&quot;.  In 1900 there was a case that went that way, but since then it was been reversed... and even more specifically overruled in various state ordinances.  Even if you did have the right to physical resist (again, you don&#x27;t, so don&#x27;t resist arrest) an &quot;unjust arrest&quot; ... you aren&#x27;t informed of the reason you are being arrested at the time of arrest, you don&#x27;t have enough information to even claim it is unjust.<p>> If Michael Brown is struggling to get free after being unnecessarily assaulted by Wilson and then sees Wilson draw his gun then of course he is going to strike the officer trying to flee.<p>This is put forth as factual &quot;of course&quot;.  But, it isn&#x27;t the common case -- most people when assaulted (justified or not) by a police officer surrender, and if it escalates to having a gun drawn... they... you guessed it, surrender.  The vast majority of police officers make it to retirement without firing their weapon while on duty.<p>> First, I&#x27;m sure most people believe that if a police officer tells you to do something you do it. That might be really good advice, especially if you have brown skin, but I think it&#x27;s not reasonable to blindly obey over-aggressive and unfounded requests just because the person has a badge.<p>You can think what you want, but you have NO RIGHT to EVER resist arrest, that is the simple fact, there is no law on your side, and it will end horribly for you.  You submit, you get arrested, you offer NO resistance and then you take action AFTER the fact (sue, try to get them fired, take it to the press, whatever).",1418552180

I started off at a smaller studio out of college and accepted a salary about 15% less than my friends who went into Aerospace and Finance.  I didn&#x27;t care, because games is where I wanted to be and I loved every moment.  I found games interesting, intellectually challenging and ultimately very rewarding.  I moved from UI to game play to AI, did some Audio programming, dabbled in graphics, helped with design, etc.  There was always something new to learn and do.  Fast forward and many of my non-game industry friends were bored with their jobs, not learning new skills and maintaining legacy code.  Some friends left the game industry to find greener pastures and more money in other fields and eventually came back due to the lack of creativity and monotony many non-game jobs entail.  This is obviously subjective and perhaps the kind of person that is not attracted to making games would find those other jobs rewarding and that is not to say that all game jobs are dynamic and wonderful.<p>Regarding long work hours and terrible pay, not all employers are created equal.  I eventually worked for a couple of different AAA companies before going indie and I had a very good salary and benefits at both companies surrounding by extremely talented developers.  I have a few friends who I would say have extraordinary salaries and perks, however, they are very good at what they do.  I have worked the crazy crunch times sure, but I think that is becoming less common especially after the EA Spouse debacle and the industry matures.  It does still exist at some companies, however, there are many other jobs and industries out there that are just as demanding.  I eventually went the indie route mainly just to see if I had the chops to run a small company and be the captain of my own ship.  It was a question I wanted to answer for my own personal growth.<p>Working at a game company just so you can have a &quot;job&quot; is probably not a good idea.  Just like I wouldn&#x27;t recommend starting or joining a startup unless your heart is really into it and you love what you are doing because, yeah, there are going to be some long hours sometimes and there is a good chance you could be making more money elsewhere.

I have walked around in the US, in Europe, in Israel (and the West Bank, not Gaza though), and Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and India.<p>The US, on the street and for it&#x27;s residents, is 99.99% a free country that respects human rights (presumably at least in part because it&#x27;s population constantly throws up stinks like this one). Walking around the US, well, I don&#x27;t need to tell you what you see. I feel a lot safer on the streets of the US just talking to people and saying whatever my political opinion is than even compared to the Netherlands (it sometimes seems like 50% of the population there believes in a Jewish or US or &quot;Capitalist&quot; or sometimes communist conspiracy and they will shout at you, or worse if you try to reason with people about it). Saudi Arabia is a country of thugs where everybody in the streets is afraid of everybody else, and your sex and skin color, and to a lesser extent your dress, determine your worth (and if you&#x27;re able to enter malls, bars and shops). Pakistan is 80% Saudi Arabia and 20% free. I&#x27;m not saying the US beats other countries in everything, far from it, but in freedom and &quot;not getting your head bashed in/arrested/fired/... because you like political party X&quot;, it is by far the best country I&#x27;ve ever seen. The most aggressive response I&#x27;ve ever seen in the US to a political opinion is laughter. And I have never, ever, seen anyone in the US refuse someone access to a bar, shopping mall, store, or ... based on skin color, sex or religion. I have seen it often in Europe (bars only), and in the middle east it&#x27;s considered normal to have ethnic, sex and religious restrictions on half the buildings in a city.<p>And frankly, the fact that the US Congress even looks at allegations of torture by a state agent, shows it&#x27;s moral superiority over the UN. The fact that people can and do write about what the CIA did without losing their jobs, disappearing, getting shot or beat up, and worse, is a situation superior to what is found in the vast majority of UN member nations. Again, this, in my mind, proves the moral superiority of the US. Hell, even compared to Russia, which is definitely a first world country. Do you think Russia doesn&#x27;t torture people ? When are you expecting the 2 first pages of the Moscow times to get dedicated to a 2 day session in the Duma about the Russian army&#x27;s use of torture ?<p>Hell, according to amnesty international, Ukraine, Poland, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands&#x27; governments have committed torture in 2014 [1](and some/most of them assisted the currently being discussed CIA program as well) [1]. I seem to be unable to find any discussion in their parliaments of that. They mostly seem to be talking about austerity measures, leaving/joining Europe, that sort of thing.<p>Here&#x27;s a paragraph on Russia, from amnesty international :
&quot;Torture methods documented by Amnesty International range from beatings, suspension from ceiling hooks, asphyxiation with
plastic bags, to electrocution, inserting needles under finger or toenails, dousing with freezing water and even rape.&quot;<p>About EU countries :
&quot;The denial of police abuses is still the default reaction across the EU and the Balkans, where the institutional response and
thoroughness of investigations are frequently inadequate.&quot;<p>Again this is much better than their reports on the middle east and Asia (even the complaints about Russia and Turkey, at least in Russia and Turkey it seems to be easy to avoid state-sponsored brutality, which is not true at all in the middle east and a lot of Asia)<p>The UN has never even looked into allegations of it&#x27;s own wrongdoing. And what half of UN member nations do comes dangerously close to &quot;state-sponsored genocide&quot; in many cases.<p>The US has moral imperfections. And yes, there&#x27;s assholes that are employed by the US government in positions of power. This is no different from any other nation. They are bad, and must be dealt with, I fully agree there. The UN, however, is a collection of thugs, massacrers, racists and worse.<p>The argument you&#x27;re making &quot;the US and UN are both imperfect&quot; is of course true, it is also completely useless. There is no hair on my head that doubts that the US has a massive moral advantage over the UN.<p>I feel that at the very least we owe it to Congress to let it figure out what to do. I&#x27;d be amazed if they didn&#x27;t at least pass a law that this can never happen again.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amnesty.org.au/resources/activist/Report-_Torture_in_2014_30_Years_of_Broken_Promises.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amnesty.org.au/resources/activist/Report-_Torture...</a>",1418551625

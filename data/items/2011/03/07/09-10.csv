While people try to 'censor' themselves in many social situations, I think society as a whole is moving towards more acceptance. Thanks to the internet, you can always find someone else 'out there' who has the same outlook on life as you. You are also able to see people from every different background and way of thinking, opening yourself up to better understanding and acceptance of them. You can be who you are wherever you are in the world and find acceptance online, even if in your hometown you may be ostracized.\nInteresting film concerning this:\n<a href=""http://www.weliveinpublicthemovie.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.weliveinpublicthemovie.com/</a>",1299491668

2296606,comment,2296425,2296598,0,0,HistoryInAction,,,"The policy that was proposed last year—and I don't have any say over changes despite now all-but running the political game supporting StartupVisa—was that if you had gotten $250k in VC or superangel funding (where superangel was defined as being a US citizen, aka not jeff clavier, that hit some bar of annual investing) or $100k per immigrant co-founder, you gained a two-year visa. If, at the end of those two years, your startup reached $1M in annual revenue, raised $1M in funding, or hired 5 people, you got a green card.<p>As far as I know, that's still what the VC guys backing this are going for, though I do know that folks like Kauffman, Vivek Wadhwa, and a fair number of others think this policy doesn't go far enough as, quote, 9 out of 10 successful startups don't raise outside capital, unquote. Still, it's an improvement in my books and seems well worth passing.

Often the cost of failure is too high.<p>You don't want an airliner-pilot to seek failure. If banks make a big mistake and we slide into recession, people loose jobs, should we pat them on the shoulder for trying? What about the judge that sends an innocent man to prison? What about the solider that accidentally shoots an unarmed man? Can we assume he has learned from his mistake and will now be a better soldier? While this might be the case, the answer must be: No, we shouldn't.<p>Instead of postulating a culture of ""fail often"", we should find a higher standard. One that is based on hard work, sober and educated decision making and quality.<p>Furthermore it can be argued that one can learn more from success than from failure. Failure can be a byproduct of trying, but by no means it should be inverted into a measurement of success.<p>Let's stop this trend towards failure-ism now.

2296597,comment,2296318,2296318,0,0,arn,,,"Ok, I've given some more thought to this.  To give some constructive criticism.  I've been watching the videos, watching people enter data, soap notes, and the transcription.  It all seems so painful.<p>The interface is a lot of small screens, with buttons connecting them.  In the dictation screen, you can't reach anything else.  You can't seem to look at labs, look at xrays.  Similarly, the soap note interface brings up a large text entry with an iPad keyboard.  Several of the other interfaces bring up these somewhat jarring iOS inputs.  None of this seems to flow well.<p>I feel like you have this open 10"" multi-touch device, but you are using interface paradigms from old point and click interfaces.<p>Here are some interesting possibilities:<p>- Use the fact that you can scroll infinitely on the iPad.  A page could have a ton of data vertically, that you can scroll up/down.<p>- Maybe you can also scroll/swipe left/right to get to different sections.  from Note to Xrays to Labs.  Let there be a definite order of those pages.   I'm thinking like the Wired magazine app for iPad.  Swipe left a couple of times, I'm at labs.  I can find what I want, swipe right a couple of times to be back where I started.  Or at least short cut buttons for every section so you can jump back and forth easily.<p>- Current labs could be embedded in the current note/encounter page.  It's obvious I'm going to want to see those.  Scroll down to see them, swipe left/right to see older ones.<p>- Why are soap notes in full text input?  Why not a large page of customizable Positive/Negative toggles?  Most EMRs are like this, but having it on the touch screen seems like it might be nice, especially if you can scroll past ones you don't care about quickly.  This also helps to minimize pulling up a full keyboard, which is an awkward event on the iPad.  You don't want to be typing long passages if you can avoid it.<p>- Seems custom interfaces could be explored for making data entry easier.  Be it medicines, or complaints etc...<p>anyhow, obviously those things are just top-of-the-head wild thoughts, but the abilities are there.  I just don't see this as an ""iPad EMR"" but an EMR that was put on the iPad.",1299490296

To achieve its goals would be to negate the reason for its existence, which would have negative consequences for the oligarchy.

2296567,comment,2295927,2296535,0,0,spiralganglion,,,"A whole bunch of things. First, background: I've recorded over 24 albums, written 5 scores, play over a dozen instruments, and have composed thousands of pages of music in various notational programs using a ton of different input methods. Ok, let's go.<p>A midi keyboard takes up space. It also takes up more space the better it gets. If you want a 3 or 5 or 7 octave keyboard, you need to have that sort of room in your work area. Imagine an entire piano keyboard on your desk. Even a smaller keyboard takes up more space than another regular computer keyboard, and having a second one of those is difficult enough to work with.<p>Space issues aside, there's the issue of workflows. I've yet to find a music notation program with an anything approaching an elegant flow. For each passage of music that you'd like to write, there are a ton of variables that need to be expressed and recorded, and the midi keyboard only handles a few of these. You need to capture pitches of multiple notes (chords), durations, accents, articulations, voicing (for multiple parts on the same staff, as in choral music), dynamics, and many other things. Many of these are optional, and only used when needed, but even the most fundamental ones are often a chore to enter. A midi keyboard is great for entering note pitches, but as you described, playing in time (at speed) seems to be the only way to avoid entering all the note-lengths by hand. Playing in time has its own problems, too. You have to match the data to a grid structure. But the grid structure needs to be strict enough to catch the subtleties of the performance, and flexible enough to compensate for human-error. Otherwise, you'll be back to manual data-entry to correct all the parsing mistakes. These constraints also depend largely on the person playing the keyboard. On the other hand, an alternating two-step process isn't any faster with a midi keyboard than a computer keyboard.<p>Midi keyboards were not created for data entry. They were created for live performance, controlling other dedicated devices that created music, like synthesizers. They've been co-opted to enter data for notation, and while they can accelerate the process somewhat, there are shortcomings on the software side. It is also largely dependent on the type of music being transcribed.<p>I am very much in favour of an iPad notation program. I've been thinking about that since last summer, but I haven't had time to make one myself. If someone tackles this problem and comes up with an elegant solution, they'll have no noteworthy competition on either side of the PC/Post-PC divide. Pun intended.",1299489106

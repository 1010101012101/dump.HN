Then you can burn through that kind of money surprisingly fast. Talent is (rightly!) expensive. So unless your co-founders and you have all the skills you need to see your product out the door you could very well need multiple 100 Ks to get going. If you&#x27;re doing anything hardware related or that needs certification or a hundred other things that you could spend your money on then you might find this is not as much as it seemed at first.<p>Not all start-ups are making simple web apps or mobile apps.<p>Doing a seed round for $300K is not much easier than $750K and will give you only half the return on your time invested.<p>At least at 750K you&#x27;ll still be looking at a relatively abbreviated process rather than a full blown DD (which would burn up too large a chunk of the investment to make sense).",1421474192

You see many arguments like yours - programmer time is expensive, you need to be a super expensive expert, just pay for the systems, blah blah... it underestimates the cost of the ridiculous inefficiency, and overestimates the cost of competency.<p>Even scientists in-experienced with serious programming can often get appreciably better at writing their data processing jobs <i>before their first job finishes</i> when you&#x27;re dealing with the really big data.

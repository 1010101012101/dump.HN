2458875,story,,,9,9,euroclydon,"Ask HN: Can Node.js Replace Mozilla Rhino?",,"I was reading through John Resig's blogs about testing out different data structures for storing and searching an english dictionary using Javascript. It struck me that he uses Node.js instead of Mozilla Rhino to test and analyze these structures and algorithms, despite the fact that he works for Mozilla. Now I know that Mozilla and John are enlightened enough not to let project sponsorship or ownership get in the way of using the best tool, but I'm curious? How does Node compare to Rhino?<p>Is Rhino dying? Steve Yegge never released Rhino on Rails. Now, also, I know that Node is vastly different, as a platform from Rhino because, in Node, you write entire web applications using chains of callbacks, and Rhino is just a JS interpreter written in Java. But, what are the applications where Node can replace Rhino, either because third party libraries aren't necessary or because the libraries are implemented for Node?<p>I'd like to hear from HN users who've started using Node where they were using Rhino before and also from users who have JS code which will only run on Rhino.<p>I'll start off with a SVG/PDF print server I have written in Rhino which uses Apache FOP and Velocity.

That is, we make more mistakes building timelines like this than can be explained by a simple lack of information.  You could call it the Eloi-Morlock bias:<p><i>Regarding distant futures, however, well be too confident, focus too much on unlikely global events, rely too much on trends, theories, and loose abstractions, while neglecting details and variation.  Well assume the main events take place far away (e.g., space), and uniformly across large regions.  Well focus on untrustworthy consistently-behaving globally-organized social-others.  And well neglect feasibility, taking chances to achieve core grand symbolic values, rather than ordinary muddled values.  Sound familiar?<p>More bluntly, we seem primed to confidently see history as an inevitable march toward a theory-predicted global conflict with an alien united them determined to oppose our core symbolic values, making infeasible overly-risky overconfident plans to oppose them.  We seem primed to neglect the value and prospect of trillions of quirky future creatures not fundamentally that different from us, focused on their simple day-to-day pleasures, mostly getting along peacefully in vastly-varied uncoordinated and hard-to-predict local cultures and life-styles. </i><p>The original paper in <i>Science</i>: <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/322/5905/1201.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/322/5905/1201.full.pdf</a><p>The quote is from here, with more explanation: <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/11/abstractdistant.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/11/abstractdistant.html</a><p>And here's more on the implications for evolutionary game theory: <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/a-tale-of-two-tradeoffs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/a-tale-of-two-tradeoff...</a><p>The last two are great reads, with one caveat.

Erlang is perfect for this. We've projected that we will max out at around 1MM connections on a 48GB, 8 core box. We're running 150K connections right now and it's using about 17% of memory and much less CPU. The key though is we already tested with multiple boxes and it works the same way.

Deep Blue may have been able to calculate 6 to 8 moves in advance, but that was after it pruned all the moves that were obviously incorrect. When you're trying to prove something mathematically however, you have to assume that even something as silly as sacrificing a queen for a pawn with no obvious positional gains is a valid move and calculate all possible branches taken from that move until checkmate some 30 moves down the road.<p>For example, checkers is a vastly simpler game than chess. Yet, it took 18 years of constant computation to solve it [1]. Even a game as simple as tic-tac-toe has 255,168 possible games [2].

Pid regardless of which machine the queue is actually living on. MNesia can be used to keep track of what PID is what and that transparently replicates around without you having to write the logic. In Node.js it's going to be less transparent and unless there's a library that does all this for you, you're still going to be putting the solution together when you could have been done in Erlang, even if you're an expert in JS and know nothing about Erlang.<p>One of the queuing libraries might just work out of the box, though.

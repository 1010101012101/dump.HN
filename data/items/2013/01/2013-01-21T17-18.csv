At least if you want to understand the underlying algorithms, which in my opinion is essential to being a good data scientist.<p>I did a masters in machine learning/computer science, but I think I could have learned a lot of the stuff on my own. The value of the masters was in projects, interaction with professors/other students, and the ability to do research (which I think is very underrated). FYI: a lot of jobs will discriminate against people without technical degrees and graduate degrees. Independent projects or relevant work experience will help.<p>My career predates kaggle, but I did do a machine learning competition to practice and apply my knowledge.

5092668,comment,5091821,5092330,12,0,Raphael_Amiard,,,"> You obviously don't know anything about the French academic system and grandes coles. Or you are being hypocritical.<p>Well i obviously know some, i've done two master degrees in French university, one in Computer Science and one in Sociology, and i've found the GP's post to be pretty accurate.<p>So please feel free to post a real rebuttal, i'm ready to argument at least as to why i think french university education prepares very badly to anything practical and creative that isn't in the domain of pure academia.<p>This for example :<p>> are in completely different schools from the people with actual know-how , who get forced into consultancies mainly, to write Java enterprise code for the rest of their lives.<p>is actually pretty much 95% true. When you get out with a french comp-sci degree, you are presented with the following choices (by your professors and the businesses linked to the university) :<p>- Either go into research<p>- Either go into very specialized industrial work (high safety embedded systems, mission critical components)<p>- Either go into big consultancies doing Java (Cap Gemini and such)<p>This does not arise from maliciousness, but only from the fact that those are the three main areas in which there is work for comp-sci students in France. The area of consumer oriented innovative enterprises, be them big or small, is pretty much nonexistent.<p>The courses in my university (which is supposedly the second best french university for computer science) are quite difficult, some of them are even good (most notably in the domain of logic/semantics, programming language research and the likes), but most of them are either:<p>- Highly theoretical, based on subsets of domains that have seen no massive practical use in decades, still being taught because they are the teacher's PHD subject.
- Supposedly practical, but using outdated/horrible/both technologies.<p>For example, i have had two introductions to web development at University, one using bash scripts and C (no kidding), by some sort of mad teacher who thought reimplementing libC with more ternaries was the way to go about life, the other using such things as JSP/Spring Framework, obviously designed to target those students who were gonna go in the ""Enterprise world"". Both made me want to kill myself (figuratively).<p>On a variety of more ""academic"" subjects where we are actually supposed to have some experts here in France, be it systems programming, embedded systems, highly parallel programming , the quality of the courses when compared to those of top american universities (which are as of now widely available for free on the interwebs) is so low that it is really, truely depressing.<p>This is obviously a complex problem, and there are no black and white, but if you are really able to argue that there is no truth to the statement of the GP, then you are the one who doesn't know a lot about french university, or being hypocritical.",1358790919

South Korea also has a huge army.<p>Also both of them have huge amounts of military equipment.<p>And finally, Korea in general (both from north and south) and very belligerant, or was at least, in the past, Korea history is filled with wars that they caused, and crazy conquest attempts.<p>Other asians are still very wary of ethnic Koreans, in Japan for example it is known that while there are several non-japanese citizens, ethinic Koreans rarely get citizenship.<p>The united Koreas, maybe will just awesomely advance the world technology... Or maybe they will start another crazy war and attempt to conquer Japan or China.<p>There are several countries that don't want to risk the second option, and thus every time one Korea is losing advantage in the stalemate, that Korea gets some sort of clandestine or official help, in a way to force the stalemate to continue, and the biggest army of the world divided in half and turned into itself.<p>I am not saying I agree or condone that, but this is how it works.",1358790881

Trumping up accusations in order to scare the defendant is a negotiation tactic that comes in package with it. So what can we do ? Is it a good idea to ban plea bargaining? I read that 90% of law suits end in plea bargaining, so, banning this avenue would DDOS the legal system.<p>Justice being the best your money can buy - it's a sad reality. They can charge an innocent and he would have to spend all he has to prove he is not guilty. How can we stop that?<p>Maybe we need more lawyerless law suits, like those from Small Claims Court, to even the playing field.<p>If only we could get rid of mandatory minimums and put common sense back in the driving chair, it would be much better.

And you really have no control whether they perceive you as an ally or a threat.<p>Orthogonal to this fact is the question of what happens when an authority is brought in to solve the conflict. And something young hackers need to learn as early as possible is that you are not entitled to a due process in every possible context. It would be unlawful if you were not given the chance of a just trial in the context of a criminal or civil lawsuit, but this does not translate well into private institutions.<p>In particular case of a student unauthorized access within a university, this problem is compounded by the fact that such University and its representatives play the rules of prosecution, judge, jury and (sometimes) defense. You also have to consider that the people doing this are not professionals of law procurement but are pulled out of their real jobs to sort out some random mess, thus the only constrain is their common sense. I've even heard the first hand report of a case in my university where the faculty member supposedly playing ""defense"" was the most gung-ho about giving the boot to the guy in question (who ended up getting a one term suspension, but got to keep his scholarship, so it could have gone much worse).<p>This is probably not ""fair"", but it is the way it is and nobody seems interested enough to make it change. Education has a number of stakeholders with sometimes conflicting preferences and goals, so this is not a trivial problem.<p>But the point is that once your actions put you in the harms way, the abstract concepts of ""fairness"" and ""proportionality of the punishment"" are academic at best. My opinion is that legality is the bare minimum standard society imposes to keep barbarism at bay, but it is pretty rough itself. So it is in your best interest to conduct yourself in such a way that appeals to ""the rules"" happen as little as possible.",1358790001

I remember one professor back in school even referring to C as strongly typed and Scheme as weakly typed.<p>I think some of the confusion is that the nature of the two sets of labels are commonly misunderstood.  They're supposed to represent two orthogonal dichotomies about how languages design.  In truth there is an orthogonal pair of dichotomies in there, but it's not captured by that set of labels.  And the labels aren't really orthogonal.<p>The real dichotomies concern two different places where you can track type information:  It can be associated with variables, or it can be associated with values.  Some languages that represent the possibilities well are:<p><pre><code>  - C: Variables, but not values
  - Ruby: Values, but not variables
  - C#: Both values and variables
  - FORTH: Neither variables nor values.
</code></pre>
As for how they're commonly described:  C is the classic example of static and weak, and C# is a good example of static and strong (though admittedly it has facilites for switching both off in a controlled manner).  Ruby is dynamic and strong.<p>But nobody wants to call FORTH dynamic and weak, and for good reason: The very phrase ""dynamically typed"" implies that types are tracked, just dynamically.  But FORTH doesn't track types at all; it's much more correct to describe it as untyped.<p>So that's where it breaks down: While strong vs. weak corresponds well to the question of whether types are associated with values, dynamic vs. static is not actually an orthogonal dichotomy, because the word dynamic describes a decision about both ways of tracking type: Dynamic languages associate type with values but not with variables.  And my earlier description of Ruby as ""dynamic and strong"" is redundant.",1358789988

I was using it since early version 3 days, through 4.x over a period of 3 years in my phd in the field of fluid-structure interaction (e.g. fish in flow). The computations usually took over several days on many cpus for 1 second of real-life simulation, making testing quite painful. Hence, many studies do not involve testing like in software field.<p>I was calculating a parameter enhancement where my calculations were showing a great 180% enhancement; this result would make it into very high ranking (15+ IF) paper right away. By then, several people had written numerous papers on this matter using this multiphysics software in well-known journals. But my gut feeling didn't let me. Eventhough my professors were pressing me to publish, I took 6 painful months (toward the end of my phd) to rigorously test the software itself, having nothing to do with my work, since it was closed-source.<p>After 6 months, I found out that a velocity term used in their stabilization algorithm does not use relative velocity, but absolute velocity, leading to enormous amount of fake diffusion into the model. I had to travel to another city in europe to convince them that there is such bug.<p>Every single work in my field that used this software till then had been severely invalid.

There are newer syscalls like pselect() which let you atomically unblock signals, execute the syscall, and re-block the signals, meaning EINTR <i>can</i> be used reliably, and then there's the even newer Linux-only signalfd() syscall which lets you receive signals via a file descriptor.

It simply doesn't work like that.<p>Usually it's programmers who are too overly enthusiastic about replacing Matlab with Python, because they are comfortable with all aspects of programming languages. The people typically writing the most complex Matlab code aren't, more often than not they are physicists or mathematicians. Python + SciPy + Matplotlib is not nearly as accessible as Matlab, and you drag in all kinds of typical 'software engineering' problems that don't exist when you stay inside the Matlab IDE and its related tools. I can conjure up a plot in Matlab and manipulate it incrementally for example, while Matplotlib often requires a lot of crazy data mangling and setup code that isn't required in Matlab (trust me, I've spent months re-implementing a library of Matlab plotting scripts in Matplotlib, and the code of some of them is completely untraceable to the original Matlab code, and full of stuff completely unrelated to plotting). Also, lots of Matlab code relies on all the crazy implicit operations and type juggling allowed by Matlab, many of which are almost fundamentally incompatible with a well-defined programming language suited for production code.<p>This is all even ignoring the fact that Matlab comes with a pretty extensive library of toolboxes that have no equivalent in SciPy or Numpy. If you're really determined and know how to program in Python, you can basically get a lot of stuff done without requiring Matlab, but if you've always been using Matlab like a prototyping tool or a very elaborate graphical calculator (and this constitutes a very extensive part of Matlab users), Python + all its scientific libraries is no substitute.",1358788737

5092379,comment,5090717,5092004,8,0,danieldk,,,"The types of polymorphism are different. Haskell's parametric polymorphism is compile-time polymorphism, Go's interfaces are run-time polymorphism.<p>If we draw a parallel to C++, Haskell's polymorphism is like templates, Go's interfaces are like abstract base classes (except that they use compile-time duck typing).<p>For example, consider the (+) function in Haskell:<p><pre><code>  (+) :: Num n -> n -> n -> n
</code></pre>
If you use an Integer as the first argument, the second argument <i>must</i> also be an integer, as well as the return type. You can observe this by currying, binding only the first argument:<p><pre><code>  Prelude> :type (+) (1 :: Integer)
  (+) (1 :: Integer) :: Integer -> Integer
  Prelude> :type (+) (1 :: Double)
  (+) (1 :: Double) :: Double -> Double
</code></pre>
In Go, you could write an interface <i>Num</i> and define a function:<p><pre><code>  func foo(a Num, b Num) Num
</code></pre>
However, if <i>float64</i> and <i>int</i> both implement the <i>Num</i> interface, you could also <i>foo</i> a float64 and int. And it would return something that conforms to the Num interface, but what type is actually constructed depends on the implementation of <i>foo</i>.<p>In other words, type classes have relatively little to do with Go interfaces, aside that they both implement a (different) form of polymorphism.<p>It's possible to make something akin to Go's polymorphism in Haskell, but you'd need to hide the type parameter of the typeclass using existential quantification.<p><pre><code>  data NumBox = forall n. Num n => MkNumBox n
</code></pre>
You can now use the NumBox for runtime polymorphism:<p><pre><code>  Prelude> :type [1::Int, 4.4::Double]
  [...]
     Couldn't match expected type `Int' with actual type `Double'
  [...]
  Prelude> :type [MkNumBox (32 :: Int), MkNumBox (22.32 :: Double)]
  [MkNumBox (32 :: Int), MkNumBox (22.32 :: Double)] :: [NumBox]</code></pre>",1358788455

To my shock and amazement, I came to realize that I <i>was</i> properly aliasing the method but, due to the nature of NSArray's implementation as a class cluster (and the fact that Obj-C doesn't have proper virtual methods like C++), the implementation of ""-[NSArray length]"" was literally:<p><pre><code>    - (NSInteger)length
    {
      [NSException raise:@""Method not defined."" format:@""%""];
    }</code></pre>",1358788329

The idea behind all this is the following: there are a number of activities, for instance the press, which suffers from the internet. People read the news online and don't subscribe to paper press anymore. They also don't want to pay to much for reading the online press. To get good articles in the papers, you need to pay professional journalists. So the conclusion is that the press industry needs to find a new business model.<p>As it happens, there are companies making fortunes on internet, and their business largely depends on the contents that is created by others. This is particularly true with Google and the press industry. If you see it that way, it seems only fair that Google participate in paying the journalists producing quality content that makes people use their search engine and/or see their ads.<p>Now the question is, how to achieve this? Let the situation evolves and see what happens? This would lead to the decline in quality of the article in the press and eventually to entire journals disappearing, except for some of them for which some private groups have invested in. This is not something that we want because private interest and information don't mix well together. It is the case that many journals are in (sometimes big) part financed on public fund, so the other solution is to augment those public funding, and have the government take care of collecting the money. This is done using taxes.<p>I hope this makes the intention clearer to those of you who don't live in France.",1358788032

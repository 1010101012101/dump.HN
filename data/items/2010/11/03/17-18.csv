The fact is that when we are young, we start from a clean slate. The youth of the current generation is probably growing up with the internet and some might say facebook as one of their primary means of connecting with their social network. And that is all they know. They have no concept of life before the internet or even facebook (or google).<p>Whereas for the older generation, we grew up not being able to just google for information. We grew up without having facebook to monitor our social networks. Yes we use facebook and google now, but our perceptions are also colored by the good ol' pre-google and pre-facebook days. There are some of us that understand the appeal of facebook and take to it like fish to water. And there are some of us that do not understand what the fuss is about.<p>For the younger generation, almost all of them take to facebook like fish to water. That is all they know. They have no concept of life before facebook or google. Can you imagine what this does to their world view? I don't think I can and I am excited to see what comes out of their perspectives.",1288807194

""Click File then select <button>. Next click on <button>"". You get the idea. If the graph didn't look identical to the teachers we had to do it over again. They were trying to teach us how to do very specific tasks on a very specific set of software, and were failing even at that.<p>And that I was constantly berated for my failure to fill out the worksheets that they called ""homework"", because I was busy teaching myself OpenGL, doesn't make me any happier about schools getting any sort of credit for my abilities.",1288807078

1865710,story,,,2,2,sainib,"5 tests my next business idea will have to pass - Can you add more?",,"I launched my most recent app - www.biznus.tv - few days back. The idea is to aggregate all the business related videos, compile the meta data and also generate more meta data and present to the users. I have been working on this idea for around 7-8 months now and in spite of providing a meaningful service, it is less likely to generate any meaningful revenue. (So you may ask why I picked this idea but I don’t want to get into that and convert this post about me and my project. So I will leave that for some other time).<p>Learning from mistakes, I wanted to note down tests that my next idea is going to have to pass before I pick it up for execution.<p>1) Good is not good enough - Everyone have ideas. I have a lot of ideas - over 100 in my list. The next idea that I pick will have to be the one that I think makes most sense from business perspective. It sounds more like a common sense but I shamelessly acknowledge that I made the mistake of picking up some ideas in past that I thought were going to be 'quick ones' rather than 'best ones'. Not anymore, pick your best bet.<p>2) What’s the problem? - If I cannot explain the problem, my idea is solving - I ain't doing it.<p>3) Show me the money - I am not building a next-generation-free_of_charge-consumer-space-social-media-web app as my next venture. In my opinion playing field is not level anymore. There a lot of big players. Players with venture money and super smart mentors. I am not saying its impossible, its just that chances of success are too slim. Like Felis Dennis says - ""You may not necessarily want to be in a glamorous sector of any market, and they are often very crowded""<p>4) Where are the customers? - There should be a market for what you are building. What’s the best way to validate that - What (What businesses) are going to be your competitors? Seth Godin says - ""Competition validates you. It creates a category. It permits the sale to be this or that, not yes or no.""<p>5) Validate the traffic from Google Keyword tool, compete.com and quantcast to make sure you get a feel of the market.<p>There are a lot of great articles from successful people, sharing experiences on how to be successful(http://jasonlbaptiste.com/startups/how-to-become-a-millionaire-in-three-years/) or how to execute an idea(http://jasonlbaptiste.com/featured-articles/how-to-go-from-idea-to-launching-with-paying-customers-in-8-steps/). The intent of the article above is to list tests you can run on the ideas in your pool of ideas and pick THE one that has higher chances of success.<p>What else do you do to make sure idea is worth executing? That it is worth spending 9-12 months of your life before you see the first dollar.",1288806897

Senators include former career politicians, but also public personas of various origin - athletes, entertainers, and others of non-political origin.<p>I would speculate that is almost out of a ""gentleman's agreement"" of sorts that senators respect and recognize their role and place in Canadian politics.  Another is attendance - only 15 senators out of 105 are required to make quorum, and many senators are almost never found in their seats.<p>I shouldn't make it seem as though the Canadian senate is merely an automatic stamp of approval; there have been past examples of dissent, discussion, debate, reform, and rejection of bills arriving in the Senate.

Remember the patent Apple filed with an iMac that converted from vertical to horizontal (1)? So imagine you've got an iMac on your desk. You're working away in OS X as you always would with a mouse and keyboard. You pull your iMac toward you and it pivots to a horizontal orientation. Sensors in the hinge signal the app to switch to fullscreen mode and you begin using the app through a touch interface using your fingers. When you're done, you return the display to the vertical position and move back to your mouse and keyboard.<p>My level of certainty isn't terribly high here, because I think there are ergonomic challenges to a pivoting touch screen device that sits on a desk. When using my iPad, the ideal position is definitively not at desk height. The device needs to be very, very close to you in order to avoid the fatigue associated with reaching. A pivoting iMac is still going to require some reach.<p>I'm also realistic about the fact that not every patent Apple files makes it to production.

Management) isn't something you can ""dabble"" in and do well.  My experience is that most ""managers"" in Google (when I interviewed, I met a few Directors, Managers and Tech Leads) are 99% technically focused.  Google swung the pendulum too far the other way.  Engineering should be in charge of the company, but rely on Managers to do management things, not have Engineers dabble in it (with the best of intentions)\nI would think if Google applied the same hiring practices to hire in hyper intelligent people with a management focus and could integrate them into the teams correctly, this would be a huge win.\n(I haven't interviewed there since '07, so things may have changed since then)",1288804223

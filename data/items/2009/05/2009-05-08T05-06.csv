How people who desire power for power’s sake generally aren’t worthy of that power.<p>That’s the category I’d put this article in.   He’s basically saying ""you should strive to be a leader because it makes you important.""  But I’d counter that by saying leaders should only lead if they see things headed in the wrong direction.  If you work in an industry where you’re happy with the direction it’s going in you probably don’t need to be a leader.<p>I guess what I'm saying is that leadership is a response to an external stimuli not an internal desire.",1241761687

Here, I'll give you rapid feedback, too, without seeing your campaign: your campaign is terrible, compared to every other actively maintained AdWords account.  That's harsh but its about as accurate as the feedback you'd get from analyzing your AdWords stats, and it has the bargain of not costing several hundred or thousand dollars to figure out.<p>Note that it is not exactly easy to read the AdWords tea leaves without both AdWords experience and experience in the particular market you're trying to read.  If I posted my AdWords stats for the first six months, would you know how to go through the virtual squid ink of metrics to figure out whether or not those results were good?  Off the top of my head, I'm pretty sure I had a 1.8% CTR at one point.  Is that good, bad, or irrelevant?  Here's my answer: depends or irrelevant.  That is my answer for almost all AdWords metrics with the exception of CPA, and if you are actually selling something already you're pretty much outside the scope of this discussion, aren't you.<p>I had a profitable business for a year and change, using AdWords the whole while, before I figured out how to use AdWords in a manner that effectively advanced the business goals relative to the time I spent on it.",1241760289

You have to trust your laptop or workstation (if you didn't, you wouldn't be typing passwords at the keyboard) so ssh-agent is pretty safe locally, but you should be careful about extending that level of trust to other hosts.<p>For example, I use agent-forwarding all the time at $EMPLOYER, because the same sysad is responsible for my workstation and the production systems, so every host is equally trustworthy.

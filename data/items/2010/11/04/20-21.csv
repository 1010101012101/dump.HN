And I even was politely asked by one of the guys if I wanted to partner up on the idea as he seemed to really like it, instead of him just taking it for his own.. as he is studying comp science in university i think.<p>This being said, I am a huge advocate on the fact that every idea has been thought of before and people are going to make the product whether I tell them or not.<p>So in conclusion, I think telling anyone who will listen about your idea is the right move.  You don't have to tell every detail of course, but the feedback, encouragement and opinions of the people who would listen to me have been a big help in this project for me.",1288904308

So many people go through life ignoring the problem and those are people who don't want to change.<p>It seems by asking for advice, you do want to change. And whether your consumption is above the norm or not, you are your own keeper. You have to ask yourself, ""Do I want to change my life or am I happy the way things are?""<p>If you want to change, and drinking less is part of that change, simply cutting down isn't the way to do it. You'll always want more and that will lead to depression. You have to figure out WHY you want the booze. You've said it takes the edge off, so what exactly is that edge? Stress? Anxiety? Boredom? Emotional Pain? Once you find that out, you'll be set. It's not easy because it means being really honest with yourself, but that's the road to happiness.<p>Some people have suggested seeing a shrink, which can help. But short of that, you can always just write your thoughts out and see where it takes you. Ask yourself the question, ""What is the edge I'm trying to take off?"" and write freely, without thinking. Do this 15 minutes a day for a couple weeks and see where it takes you. Penzu (the journal I use) is great because you can set reminders to write. I have a premium account and just write via email into my journal. I would write on a pad or in my inbox but I wouldn't want my girlfriend to read it.<p>There are so many things in life to enjoy that one shouldn't need an escape all the time. If you're drinking because you're bored, start taking some risks, take up a hobby, do something adventurous. A life wasted in a bar is truly sad indeed.",1288903904

To solve this you'd need to be able to pull all the 'purple' items from deep in the tree into it's own list, or get a list of everything that I said needed to be done today, or by friday.<p>In any case, I think this is a great tool, and I have been looking for a seamless way of keeping track of things, and this just might fit the bill.

The Vietnamese food around 12th and Jackson is as good as anywhere (came here from SV and it matches up fine), there are significant Korean communities in the Lynwood and Federal Way burbs where that food is good, Ethiopian food is pretty good in the Central District, Indian food on the eastside isn't as bad as you imply, there are some great taco buses, etc.  And on Chinese food, the restauraunt I would most miss if I moved away is Sichuanese Cuisine; it's dirty, spicy, greasy, and fantastic.  There's a big step down from there though.<p>The homgeneity is split usually on neighborhood and economic lines; the rich neighborhoods are all WASPy but get down to the southside and it's generally all minority.  That's what happens when housing prices are so disparate.<p>The styles you talk about are present in seemingly every major city that hasn't experienced complete suburban flight.  It's the other ones that annoy me; Capitol Hill is like a lookatthisfuckinghipster theme park and everywhere else there's an obsession with appearing outdoorsy.

Publications don't just tell writers they're getting $.05 per word and then let them run off and produce as many words as they want. Rather, they tend to have word limits and expectations per article: 500, 1000, etc. The reasons they pay ""per word,"" and not necessarily a flate rate per piece, are several:<p>a) They want to reserve the right to edit the final piece and/or change word count expectations on the fly.<p>b) There might be additional work added to the work order, such as sidebars or supplementary appendices. Rather than draw up an entirely new contract or fee structure, they'll just add these to word count.<p>All in, pay-per-word usually ends up <i>underpaying</i> writers for their contributions to typical publications or advertisements. Pay-per-word doesn't take into account hours per article, which can be highly variable depending on the nature of the assignment.

It makes you less suspicious than someone without citizenship, sure.  But it's still not sufficient for an IRA-style campaign.<p>e.g. Attacking a shopping mall or hotel isn't difficult and all but impossible to prevent, I absolutely agree.  The difference is, the al qaeda agent won't find refuge a few blocks away. He won't melt into any crowd. He won't have trusted people from the community who will keep quiet or lie to the authorities for him. He won't have a weapon supplier who continues to supply him. And the resource that he <i>does</i> have are far more likely to melt away as it becomes clear that he is out to indiscriminately murder. Ergo the ability of any foreign agent to make subsequent strikes is drastically reduced.<p>And, unless I'm mistaken, the IRA never <i>set out</i> to murder non-uniformed, uninvolved civilians.  Those that were killed, such as on Bloody Friday, were considered among the IRA wholly undesirable collateral damage.  While it takes a certain kind of person to be convinced to drop off a bomb designed to strike a military target, or property target of a collaborator, that <i>might</i> kill innocent people, it's far, far more difficult to find people who will execute an attack <i>designed</i> to kill people going about their day.<p>And I absolutely agree that our response is laughable.  But that's how it goes.  Authority has no vested interest in proportional or rational response.  Its rewards are aligned with over-reaction.  If its masters (ostensibly the voters) don't choose to curtail that response or correct the reward structure, we'll only see continued escalation.",1288902310

There's no real pattern with it for me, but what I have noticed is that I put quite a bit of weight on in the past few years, partly through getting into real ale, then into cocktails, then I damaged my knee. Before I knew it I'd put on a fair amount of weight and couldn't exercise. To make matters worse I'm fairly social and generally run the cocktail bar at parties.<p>I'm not going to diagnose but my first guess would be that you might be  used to a particular drinking pattern. When you step out of that pattern it feels odd. I certainly had this after drinking a glass of wine most evenings in front of the TV. It was part of my switch off from work ritual to separate work from home life. I changed my ritual and cut it out, although I do sometimes have a glass of red wine with an evening meal (but usually once every two weeks, if that).<p>Currently as I'm on a diet I'm not drinking, although I'm only following my diet during the week (at the weekends I eat and drink sensibly, but don't diet).<p>You need to decide what you want. If you want to give up alcohol completely then do it. You've managed periods before, and don't see the occasional drink as a failure - think of all the time you're not drinking and see if the time you get back is worth it.<p>If you want to manage your drinking more effectively then you need to work out in advance a system that works for you. This is harder than stopping drinking and you need to commit to it. I limit my calorie intake, so that kind of determines whether or not I can drink and how much. I also decide how much I'm going to drink before I go out on the weekend. This works for me. YMMV.",1288901483

It was an idea of ""That would be cool to have.""  It wasn't a project I would be passionate about.  I go to amusement parks about once every other year.<p>I'd have to have been in the park a lot to map out points where you could walk, write the algorithms for navigating the park from any random point of interest to any other random point of interest in a reasonably efficient way while following the boundaries of the pathways.  I'd have to have kept the app updated when anything changed at the park, including things like ""For two weeks, this one path is blocked off because construction is happening"" which happens fairly regularly at Knott's Berry Farm.<p>Although those are all challenges I could have overcome given the time and resources, it wasn't something I would be very passionate about and it would die out as a result.<p>I've had a lot of reasonably good ideas, and some of them have worked out rather well in the past.  Most of them I don't pursue more than as an idle thought.  Those I choose to work on I do as a result of how much fun they will be, how passionately I feel about what I'm building, and how challenging I think it will be.  A few weeks ago How I Met Your Mother inspired the idea for <a href=""http://www.notanewyorker.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.notanewyorker.com/</a> and that was something I said, ""I'll build it tonight, I have nothing better to do.""  It's a cute little website, and the biggest motivating factor was I thought it would be funny, and using Python on Google AppEngine would be interesting because I've not used it to build anything like that.  I found I hate Google AppEngine now though.",1288901247

Saying 'we do pay the writers for their copyright by giving them a free copy of their own content' is not an answer.<p>I remember when I used to write a monthly column in a computing magazine I would take a monthly salary of $1 simply to remove any ambiguity about ownership.

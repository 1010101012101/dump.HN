As well as smaller diesels that are towing another car (A &quot;dinghy&quot;) up hills.  The higher mileage is usually from Mercedes Sprinter based RVs, and Class 7 & 8 truck conversions.<p>Costs when driving are high, because of the fuel expense.  But once you&#x27;re parked in a campground (or even in the street like in the story) the costs are pretty low -- $200-400 a month (or $20-50 for a daily rate) for a campground. $50-200 to refill the propane tank.  And $20-40 to empty the black water tank at a dumping station.  Some campgrounds charge for electricity (20, 30, or 50 amp connection). Internet can be had over a parks WiFi, satellite, or a MiFi device (factoid: a 50GB plan on AT&T is $300/month), or if you&#x27;re monthly, a campground may allow TimeWarner or Comcast to run a line to your rig.",1378069190

6312122,comment,6310555,6311879,6,0,Chris_Newton,,,"<i>You forgot to mention one of the main criticism to use exceptions for errors: the processor penalty.</i><p>As with much of the exceptions debate, its important not to over-generalise here.<p>For example, if youre writing in a compiled language like C++ and your compiler uses a table-driven implementation for the exception mechanism (as most modern ones did, the last time I checked) then there isnt necessarily any direct runtime overhead at all when no exception is thrown. In fact, the non-exceptional code path can even run a little faster than equivalent code with manual error handling via return codes, if conditional logic for propagating error codes can be omitted at all the intermediate levels between the one(s) where exceptions are thrown and the one(s) where they are caught.<p>On the other hand, the possibility of an exception being thrown might interfere with some optimisations. Also, the jump tables can be huge: I once saw the compiled output for a moderately large code base drop in size by 1/3 just from compiling it with exceptions disabled.<p>In short, there are a lot of factors at play, but anyone who parrots the line that using exceptions always slows things down has never spent much time looking at what actually happens with real compilers. And of course, this is only in one type of compiled language, which doesnt necessarily imply anything about the performance characteristics of other languages (which vary widely).",1378069068

I&#x27;ve been doing web development since shortly before firebug was created and most recently spent 2 years at Ruby/Rails shop. Now I want to build with Scala and the Play Framework.<p><i>Heres the pitch:</i><p>This is a startup building a service to help people find shared rides to and from nightlife (bars / restaurants / etc.) so they don&#x27;t have to drive home drunk.<p>Also have big ambitions of becoming a general purpose local transit alternative (think commuters) but want to start with the smaller market segment first.<p>I want the company to ultimately be completely distributed but I want people in LA (especially Santa Monica), NYC, Austin, Atlanta, Houston or the SF Bay Area to start for the first 3 to 6 months. These places have active nightlife scenes that I know and/or quality technical talent around.<p>Right now the company is completely bootstrapped and I want to keep it that way for as long as possible so youll need to have a cash reserve. If we can get really good traction getting funding may be entertained but Id rather raise money from customers, you should feel the same too.<p><i>Heres where you come in:</i><p>Across the board people will need to be scrappy and not be afraid of wearing many hats.<p>Specific roles:<p>- - - -  - - - - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - - -<p>*  CTO / Vp Engineering<p>Have you built cool stuff that lots of people use?<p>Do you want to run you own engineering organization of really smart people and have them at your disposal to help solve problems?<p>I want to build from the ground up with Scala on the backend.

I&#x27;m not sitting here twirling my mustache trying to get people to say &quot;BI == Stalin!!&quot; - it seems to to me to lead in that direction, though, and I&#x27;m genuinely wanting to understand <i>why</i> it doesn&#x27;t (or if it does, why that&#x27;s okay).<p>> Considering supply effects, the likely first order result of a basic income is an increase in the cost of basic goods and also an overall increase in the consumption of them<p>The increase in cost seems obvious (as the necessary contraction of available capital would invariably cause), but I guess I&#x27;m hung up on the idea that there would be an overall increase in consumption (or at least, enough of an increase to offset the costs). People are already buying basic goods, be it on government welfare or not; would BI substantially increase purchases of those goods? As I understand BI, the general idea is to provide enough money for everyone to be able to purchase a minimum level of food, clothing, and shelter, so as to attain some particular quality of life. So, my first question would be &quot;how many people do we currently have who are not able to attain this minimum quality of life?&quot;, which seems like would be the <i>only</i> market for whom consumption absolutely would increase under a BI plan. As I understand BI, for those currently on welfare, it&#x27;s approximately analogous - there wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be much of a change in income. I feel like this is a piece I&#x27;m missing - why would consumption of basic goods significantly increase? Basic goods by definition have a price elasticity of less than 1; you don&#x27;t get linear returns in demand by increasing income.<p>Re: [1] Woefully unfamiliar, and making an effort to fix that by reading basically all the economic philosophy I can get my hands on. I&#x27;m aware that the USSR wasn&#x27;t a great implementation of Marx&#x27;s ideals, but I also believe that even the best system gets screwed up by people - if we could actually implement ideal communism, it&#x27;d probably be awesome.

If I wanted to use private roads all the time, I would still have to pay the tax; additionally, states do not allow private roads in cities, for example.

The fact that they don&#x27;t want to clean up other peoples&#x27; messes for $10/hr doesn&#x27;t mean that they are &quot;lazy&quot;...it means they are normal people who don&#x27;t want to do dirty jobs for low pay.<p>One of the things that a BI will do for us is weed out the people who don&#x27;t want to work.

There&#x27;s a good reason that one of a government&#x27;s first relief measures in a recession is to ease taxes.<p>> Say that each year you set aside 20% of the GDP for basic income. Then your basic income plan already automatically increases with inflation.<p>It&#x27;s important that we not conflate &quot;inflation&quot; with &quot;consumer price index&quot; here. The GDP is not fixed to the CPI - they have an inverse relationship. This means that if the GDP contracts significantly (reducing BI), the CPI could well expand outside of the bounds of what BI provides, necessitating the need for a greater BI contribution.

Plenty of deeply anti-communist thinkers--including probably the most effective one in history--have supported a basic income.<p>Why did your native Poland fall far short of its productive potential? As you yourself say, it wasn&#x27;t for lack of money: it was because the things people wanted to consume were not being produced.<p>The root cause of that was broken capital markets: special interests (or foreign special interests, in the case of Poland) captured political control of the economic resources of Poland and used non-market decision making to allocate capital. If people who completely deprioritize popular standard of living control capital, then, yes, unsurprisingly other things--military, party functionaries, foreign invaders--will end up getting their demand met.<p>Also: &quot;Because life ain&#x27;t fair, it never will be unless we live in utopia where everyone is good and there is no evil.

From email to tweets, from forum postings to customer complaints, from enterprise social to automated systems monitors, the drivers for business are now in vortex of voices reflecting markets, internal morale, innovation, brand equity, product acceptance, politics and threats. Rational intend has shifted to irrational actions. Understanding the past bares no guarantee for the future. Understanding what&#x27;s actionable in streams after-the-fact is expensive. Even dangerous.<p>This new paradigm requires new tools and methods that can make sense out of the stream and understand human emotion. Bottlenoses core technology - StreamSense -  creates a virtual mind map of everything people pay attention to. It is a new kind of database to derive powerful new insights. StreamSense gives organizations the emotional intelligence that they didnt have before. It allows them to sense what people are feeling and to anticipate the unknown unknowns - both the good and the bad.<p>Attempts at creating machine understanding of our world like the Semantic Web and the Knowledge Graph have failed due to two fundamental flaws: 1) A model of the world is not something that should be derived from documents written by experts; 2) In order to build a global brain you need to understand human emotion and human intend.<p>Bottlenoses ultimate mission is to create a global artificial brain. This global consciousness is build out of a continuous stream of human conversation and attention. By analyzing these vast amounts of data and by analyzing the emotions around it, we build up a mental model of the world.

Riddled with victim mentality (bad), but desire to improve story telling of movies with a very narrow focus (somewhat good).<p>Here&#x27;s an example of victim mentality, but not from the author&#x27;s perspective.\n- why are the villains in movies often English or German. Discrimination!\n- why don&#x27;t we have Australian heroes in movies? Australian actors are forced to change their accents and nationalities... It&#x27;s disgusting...  It&#x27;s xenophobic!<p>Now take those examples with a grain of salt.  I don&#x27;t have a victim mentality that insists on x% of movie heroes being Australian ... It&#x27;s superficial and mandates others on what they must think.<p>I remember a gay author who was told to add more straight characters - the one story of his that I heard kept on referring to a straight dog.. When I asked my gay friend about the importance of a &quot;straight&quot; dog, he explained the back story of the mandate...  The dark side to political correctness.<p>Here&#x27;s where I partially agree with the author.  Black Widow and the other &quot;Rambo in slacks&quot; were pathetic characters by Joss Whedon - some of the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen.  Arrogant, rude, completely self-absorbed and able to take down 20 &quot;baddies&quot; at the same time with their bare hands.  Remember Stallone as Rambo? Well, Joss Whedon thinks that adding slacks makes Rambo a better character... Yeah, right.  But rather than see &quot;sexism&quot; and &quot;insistence of 50% female leads&quot;, I see &quot;crap writing&quot;, &quot;area for improvement&quot; and &quot;lost opportunity&quot;.  Let the writers decide what gender a character is... But highlight opportunities for thinking out of the box (go Aussie heroes ;)<p>Having said all of that, I&#x27;m a huge fan of Legend of Korra.  Korra is a believable heroine who retains her femininity and humility: brilliant writing.  Lin Bei Fong: a tough as nails woman that shows compassion and vulnerability.  Many writers and directors could learn a think or two from Di Martino and Koneitzko (the Korra writers).<p>One of my other heroes is JK Rowling.  In her Potterverse, she chose to have a balance of 50% male/female characters that were fairly well balanced.  It worked very well and did not detract from the story.  If anything, it added credibility.  It was important (at least to me) that the characters made sense, more than what their gender was.<p>In summary, the referenced article is a thinly veilled feminist (sexist) piece that dictates too much and is too narrowly focused (aka feminism).  I agree that female characters are usually poorly written and I love when I see female characters written well.<p>Then again, I&#x27;d also love to see corporate bankers held accountable, NSA snooping to be reigned in and sexism (from feminists or otherwise) being denounced ... I have my doubts that any of these wishes will come true.",1378066107

Wealth and entrepreneurship are heavily discouraged, if not outright banned.  Those who advocate for a BI have nothing against wealth and entrepreneurship, and would probably withdraw their support for it if they believed that it would result in the outcome that you predict.  BI isn&#x27;t about everyone being equal, but rather about establishing a minimum income level.<p>> If I am producing wealth, but it is not contributing to my quality of life, I have zero incentive or motivation to continue producing wealth.<p>I think that the ideas that you have about incentives and wealth don&#x27;t track with reality.  Just look to yourself--I would be surprised if you live your entire life as a wealth-maximizing entity.  Most people are very complex in their motiviations, and many, many wealthy people continue building wealth because it is a side-effect of something that they love to do, not because they want to make even more money.<p>Regarding equilibrium:<p>What makes you think that we aren&#x27;t already near the price equilibrium that would be reached under a BI system?  Ostensibly, at least at first, the only people who would see a gain in income net of taxes under BI would be people who are currently receiving some sort of social welfare payment such as social security, unemployment, or AFDC/TANF, which payments would be eliminated concurrently.

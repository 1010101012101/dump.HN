I don't think I would have responded so kindly in Jonathan's place. I probably would have taken this as an opportunity to tell Sam Odio what I really think of his actions. So, yes, compared to that Jonathan absolutely took the high road. But also from a philosophical perspective, redirecting this toward the public participants of the card experiment was absolutely the right thing to do.",1313312361

Far from being a sudden, empty insight, this is an idea I've been thinking about for years, and in fact I've told that story many times to many people (and it generally gets across what I consider to be a powerful idea).<p>I've also used the technique many times myself. I've run 3 businesses, and it's an exceptionally powerful tool in negotiation. Not, of course, applied bluntly like an imbecile (like the ""boss"" mentioned in one of the other comments), but subtly, at the right moment, without emphasising it. Letting the other person think, talk, and say what you need them to say rather than trying to goad them into it is an essential business skill. You probably use it without even thinking about it.<p>So, really sorry that you personally found nothing of value here (many other people did, from the looks of it) but I don't think the personal attacks were called for and they're out of place on a normally respectful forum like HN.<p>It is sad that your pointless name-calling now dominates what was a healthy discussion.

No regular business would even think of doing that on it's own. It's congress behaving stupidly as usual.<p>Also, it needs to stop the practice of employees purposely retiring early and then being hired back by friends as contractors.

2883170,comment,2882356,2882633,12,0,gfodor,,,"While I appreciate the sentiment, I have to take issue with your comments here. I have cystic fibrosis, and have been diagnosed since I was 3. As you surely know, this disease is not the same for everyone, since it is caused by a wide array of genetic defects that manifest themselves differently in each patient.<p>Beyond this, the major health effects of CF are not directly due to these genetic defects. The main symptom of CF is the build up of thick mucous in the lungs, however the battle against CF is a battle against infection, not against mucous. It's only recently that the role of the immune system has started to be understood. Needless to say, CF is a manifestation of a large, complex system of things, all of which vary from patient to patient, and change dramatically as the patient goes through life.<p>It's taken decades to unravel the puzzle thusfar, with many roads leading to dead ends. As you surely know, CF was a disease that was supposed to be cured 10-15 years ago. But, it's proven difficult.<p>There are reasons for hope. The truth is that your particular struggle with CF may have made it possible for you to get well through certain dietary changes, but the fact is this is a complex, ever-changing disease and dietary changes, while helpful, certainly are insufficient for most CF sufferers to feel well.<p>Decades of medical research have brought about drugs that, after years of study, have proven reliability in increasing FEV1. (I was one of the patients in the Phase II trial of Pulmozyme many years ago.) These have been a godsend for myself and other CF sufferers.<p>Your blog seems to make many claims unsupported by medical research, and has a long series of hypotheses and theories about how certain things affect yourself and your child. There are a few things that I see in your writing that I suggest you reflect on as part of the reason you are having a time being accepted by the CF community:<p>- You seem to have an attitude that your solution is so simple, ""boring"", and hard work, that you've managed to figure out the solution when all these foolish doctors and researchers have had their heads up their asses. It's not easy, and they haven't. This attitude manages to tell CF sufferers that its their laziness keeping them sick. I can assure you all of us work hard and would gladly do what we need to get well if we knew it was possible.<p>- You play the victim card, alienating anyone who hasn't heard of your blog before.<p>- You make logical fallacies. You claim that nobody telling you your technique failed is proof-positive that it probably works. You claim that people tell you that they have had success as proof as well. These are classic fallacies in medical research, and is part of the reason medical research is so hard to do correctly.<p>In order to make a positive impact on the CF community, I'd encourage you to attempt to reach out to researchers and collaborate with them in a <i>constructive</i> fashion. I'd suggest you do the research on what has been learned so far about CF. I'd suggest you educate yourself on biology, genetics, immunology, and basic medicine as much as you can. I hope you can channel your energy into organizing information in an honest, informative manner without having it be tarnished by the various things I mentioned above. Good luck, and I hope you and your son continue to see good health.<p>Edit: for those interested, I'd encourage you to check out the CF foundation's drug pipeline:<p><a href=""http://www.cff.org/research/DrugDevelopmentPipeline/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cff.org/research/DrugDevelopmentPipeline/</a><p>The CF foundation has done some good and some not so good things in the past, but this page at least is accurate and up-to-date. VX770 right now stands to be the most promising path to alleviating the symptoms of CF sufferers in a large way.",1313311931

2883159,comment,2882885,2882885,5,0,achompas,,,"I'm shocked to see Marco criticize what is essentially the ""Apple"" of the home gaming market. Both Nintendo and Apple have changed their industries on three separate occasions:<p>>> Nintendo|Apple brought home gaming|computing to the masses with the NES|Macintosh.<p>>> Nintendo|Apple revolutionized mobile gaming|phones with the Game Boy|iPhone.<p>>> Okay I run out of steam here but Nintendo put out the Wii which halted the home console race-to-the-bottom, while Apple changed portable music with the iPod.<p>The above hints at how Nintendo and Apple play similar games. They're very skilled at disrupting industries, they create products that appeal to consumers' emotions (whether by nostalgia or design aesthetic), and they <i>don't make dumb business decisions.</i><p>I'm not saying Nintendo is fine. It's clear that Nintendo faces stiff competition, but that's true of any consumer electronics company. What, Nintendo <i>only</i> sold 4.3 million 3DSes in its first five months? That's not much worse than the 5.27 million DSes they sold six months after launch [0]...or the 4 million iPhones 2Gs Apple sold 6 months after a price cut. [1]<p>Nintendo is a great company. The 3DS price drop shows they're considering their future place in consumer electronics. Marco's comments on their situation aren't novel or insightful, so this is kinda-sorta a fluff article (one of several we've seen recently from him and Gruber).<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS_sales"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS_sales</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IPhone_sales_per_quarter_simple.svg#Data_and_references"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IPhone_sales_per_quarter_s...</a>",1313311565

Sales should be increasing (dramatically) not staying flat. Developers probably aren't going to flock to a fledgling platform just because it has Nintendo's name on it. (GameCube, N64)<p>#1 is the most likely and Nintendo doesn't have a SmartPhone. They wouldn't have released the 3DS if they had one in the pipeline. They're probably several years away and no matter what they do it will likely not be able to compete with Apple, Samsung, HTC, etc so it will have a small installed base. The same problem the PSP phone has today. They also have an OS problem. They would have to use Android, probably heavily customized, and launch their own Android market app because you can't put Google's Android Market on a device targeted at kids. Then what? It's not a great portable gaming machine and it's not a great SmartPhone. Doomed to fail.<p>Doesn't hurt that Apple would probably throw a small fortune at Nintendo to develop exclusively for iOS. Apple and Nintendo share a lot of the same values. Seems like a perfect fit to me.",1313310430

Especially if there was a lot of money and treachery involved.<p>Most developers (me included) know from personal experience how awful it is to watch someone you consider to be an asshole or a rip-off become very successful. Most of us also know how it the feels to discover that some company recently took off like a rocket with one of your ideas; usually they got the same idea independently, but if they actually copied it from you - that's a very special kind of pain.<p>That being said, I think it's important to remember the huge success of Facebook is not just based on the initial idea. There were many social networks before Facebook. As painful as it may be to some, the most important thing Facebook did was taking the company from the initial idea to where it is now and from where I stand neither the Winklevosses nor Aaron can really claim they did that.<p>As a developer and an ideas man myself, this is kind of a hard reality to face as well, because it means that in the end business practices and marketing are exponentially more important than concepts and programming.",1313310351

2883099,comment,2881455,2881455,5,0,TrentS,,,"Incidentally, I just finished reading Knuth's original article from which his now famous quote originated. If you'll forgive the large copy and paste I think it is insightful to see the quote in context.<p>The original quote from 'Structured Programming with go to Statements' Computing Surveys, VOL 6, No. 4, December 1974 on page 268 is:<p><i>""The improvement in speed from Example 2 to Example 2a is only about 12%, and many people would pronounce that insignificant. The conventional wisdom shared by many of today's software engineers calls for ignoring efficiency in the small; but I believe this is simply an overreaction to the abuses they see being practiced by penny-wise-and-pound-foolish programmers, who can't debug or maintain their ""optimized"" programs. In established engineering disciplines a 12% improvement, easily obtained, is never considered marginal; and I believe the same viewpoint should prevail in software engineering. Of course I wouldn't bother making such optimizations on a one-shot job, but when it's a question of preparing quality programs, I don't want to restrict myself to tools that deny me such efficiencies.<p>There is no doubt that the grail of efficiency leads to abuse. Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.<p>Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%. A good programmer will not be lulled into complacency by such reasoning, he will be wise to look carefully at the critical code; but only after that code has been identified. It is often a mistake to make a priori judgments about what parts of a program really critical, since the universal experience of programmers who have been using measurement tools has been that their intuitive guesses fail. After working with such tools for seven years, I've become convinced that all compilers written from now on should be designed to provide all programmers with feedback indicating what parts of their programs are costing the most; indeed, this feedback should be supplied automatically unless it has been specifically turned off.""</i>",1313309327

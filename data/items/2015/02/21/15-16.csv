9085809,comment,9085025,9085025,0,0,danso,,,"It&#x27;s funny to come across this just now...for the past quarter, I&#x27;ve been teaching a basic programming class that focuses on the command-line...the most complicated thing we cover is sed (here&#x27;s a list of tools we use: <a href=""http://www.compciv.org/unix-tools/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.compciv.org/unix-tools/</a>) and the homework I&#x27;ve assigned generally involves scraping and data-munging, such as writing a batch job to scrape the USAJobs.gov API (<a href=""http://www.compciv.org/curriculum/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.compciv.org/curriculum/</a>)...<p>I agree with the OP that conceptually, the command-line is the best place to start learning programming...the idea that a tool should be kept simple, but that it should be easy to connect things together, and that it&#x27;s up to the human operator, not the computer, to do this work...this is very powerful, and something I wish I had learned early on as a programmer. The way that Unix tries to think of everything as text is also a powerful concept, because for most beginners, they think of file formats as being &quot;magical&quot; and immutable, they don&#x27;t have the concept that at the core of it, everything is just binary (everything being &quot;just text&quot; is a nice middelground from OS magic and trying to read binary)<p>However, the beauty of this philosophy is hard for non-programmers to appreciate or take advantage of. Moreover, things that I love as a programmer, such as silence-by-default and sparse error messages...are massive stumbling blocks for beginners. While I&#x27;ve done enough programming to appreciate silence, it&#x27;s another thing to be a beginner who has never edited code in a text-editor to deal with &quot;silence&quot;...perhaps the biggest obstacle is the high difficulty in debugging. I can generally pinpoint any error in seconds...but this is only after years of general programming. The way that Bash continues on when an undeclared variable is referenced (via a typo) has led to hours of frustration for my students.<p>I think next year when I teach the class, if I do Unix again, I&#x27;m going to commit the first two weeks to muscle memory and flashcard-like memorization...it&#x27;s too difficult to get the higher-level concepts of programming while you&#x27;re stumbling around with recognizing variables. On the other hand, I think I may not try to teach Unix again, and will just stick to Python. One of my goals of teaching Unix was to avoid complexity and especially, things like OOP...I think Python can be carefully taught to fit that route...though I&#x27;ll miss the ability in Bash to do such real-world tasks as curl, parse, and analyze a webpage in just two lines.<p>Edit: There was also a practical reason for doing things in Unix...all my students have different kind of laptops and OSes...and Stanford&#x27;s shared computing runs on Ubuntu. So they did all their assignments on the shared computing cluster. That led to another issue of not being able to easily edit script files, in the way that you can do with Sublime Text on your own OS.",1424534377

When I look at a select box on a page, my brain automatically thinks &quot;okay, was this rendered using HTML or JS? what styles have been applied? is there an onchange callback? how is the data being populated? what&#x27;s the data model look like? is it using two-way data binding or posting with a form?&quot; I can only speculate about these aspects because I&#x27;ve had to build them all before. I absolutely struggled when I first had to deal with new concepts like Javascript frameworks or unit testing, but after sticking it out for a few months, I was able to internalize how they work and see the underlying design patterns, rather than just the implementation details.<p>If you could elaborate on certain issues that you&#x27;re running into, we might be able to give you more insight into what exactly is tricky about it.",1424534301

I learned to be skeptical of every image, every advertisement, and there is so much more psychology, philosophy and art theory I could go into. I am &#x27;female&#x27; and I grew up thinking the Photoshopped pictures of myself on social sites were the &#x27;right&#x27; pictures, the &#x27;right&#x27; self. To put a long story short, an eating disorder very mildly describes the kind of maladaptive clash I experienced between my physical form and my intellectual one.<p>I imagine the same thing happened when journalism was revealed to be yellow journalism, and other technologies slowly reveal their effect through generational adaptation.<p>In one sense, it&#x27;s the same thing that happens because of the cycles of birth and death; technologies and cultures are born, and they are subject to death too. It&#x27;s not surprising, but it is surprising, because the stuff that changes is not always the stuff you expect to change. In another sense, it&#x27;s screwed up, and the only thing I can really hope for is that some kind of overarching balance can be intelligently directed towards and balance can be achieved.

The cost of ownership makes those high rents incredibly inefficient and the returns on &quot;investment&quot; questionable, in my opinion, but there you have it.<p>The rent I charge on my (nice, two-story, good neighborhood) property that is not located in the Bay Area is about 1% of the price I bought it at.

For example, refunds being limited to 60 days on Paypal will cause issues over time.<p>Even if the cost was fixed and upfront, a Paypal integration isn&#x27;t an intelligent thing to prioritize for most startups. There are likely hundreds of other things a startup could do to increase its revenue by more than they would save in CC processing fees, so they should focus on those things first.<p>Eventually a Paypal integration will make sense, but likely not for a processing discount. Instead it will become useful for international payments, and even then most startups have enough headaches with Paypal that they choose to keep Stripe as the default checkout option, and use Paypal as a secondary option.",1424534179

You can work around it with things like object pools, but some library or API will assume that the GC is OK and will be quietly spitting out objects continuously which will lead to a GC pause.<p>It&#x27;s worth pointing out the Android devs finally started noticing this for Lollipop (probably due to their animations) and the API now has lots of places where it passes Java primitives instead of objects, which is the distinction between passing by value and by reference. Even if you&#x27;re in C++ modern compilers can only make the most out of it if you pass by value, as this enables all sorts of other optimisations to kick in.<p>The key benefit of reference counting is it&#x27;s predictable. Real time systems are also not strictly the lowest latency, they are defined by predictability. This becomes a preoccupation with minimising your worst case scenario.",1424533947

As a W-2 Employee of my company, about 25% of my income is taken out of my paycheck if I claim to deductions. This means the government is getting 35% of my salary for doing, what I consider, very little.

The USA should be a union of states collectively working together, but the country is increasingly moving towards a single state, with a one size fits all policy. As it stands now, each state is incredibly different and policies made for California are in no way fit for Alaska or New York. Federal taxes should be significantly lower then they are now and lower then state taxes, and should be spend on defense, and inter state mediation. State taxes should get a small boost and provide services to its residents inside the state only. Reduce the scope of where tax dollars are spent and what they are spent on, and efficiency will go up, citizens will have more money in their pockets to fuel the consuming engine of America, and huge government programs that sweep up everyone&#x27;s communications in the country will be harder to fund.

He uses the concept of staged authenticity to explain the tourist experience; people know what they are experiencing is not real and authentic but feel content with it anyway. According to MacCannell, staged authenticity is authenticity’s negation, an attempt to move beyond the front-back binary made famous by Erving Goffman, very much similar to what Edward Bruner, also hoping to transcend such binaries as authentic – inauthentic and front – back, wrote in Culture on tour.<p>To Goffman, all social action is play, and he uses theater as an analogy when he explains how people will alter their social roles according to their position (front or back) on the stage. The idea of people necessarily withholding some aspects of their personality will ultimately lead to a position where the tourist is always confronted with a staged play, never allowed backstage to experience authenticity. Bruner and MacCannell have, however, different ideas about what is to be found backstage. For MacCannell the back is a place where secrets are only popularly thought to be kept but, in fact, do not exist. While MacCannell explicitly denies the possibility of authenticity residing in the back regions, Bruner stated that MacCannell believes there is always true and real at the back.&quot;",1424530934

9085665,comment,9085411,9085411,0,0,Shinkei,,,"Physician here. I think I can provide some clarification for what is going on here. I just read the article the WHO is addressing and this is a line from the final paragraph:<p><i>Our analysis shows that stochastic effects associated with DNA replication contribute in a substantial way to human cancer incidence in the United States.</i><p>First, the terminology is important to understand. In medicine, &quot;stochastic&quot; is in contrast to &quot;deterministic&quot; which describe the occurences of pathology based on a risk factor. In a &quot;stochastic&quot; model, if you receive 10 severe sun burns then your chances of getting a skin cancer go up over someone who only received 1 severe sun burn, but are by no means certain or even that your cancer will be more severe... simply an increase in probability. In a &quot;deterministic&quot; model, if you receive 5 Grays of radiation then you will have less severe symptoms than someone who received 50 Grays of radiation and for the most part, your symptoms will be certain and predictable.<p>Now you need to have one element of cancer biology under your belt:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis</a><p>This basically says that as cells divide, errors are propagated through their progeny until there is a proverbial &#x27;straw that breaks the camel&#x27;s back&#x27; and the cell becomes cancerous.<p>In summary, that line from the final paragraph is basically saying that cells that divide more rapidly in the human body are more likely to become cancer. Well, yeah of course!<p>We have known this for a long time but what this paper did is sort cancers into two groups, one that is primarily stochastic and one that is primarily deterministic. The result <i>appears</i> impressive because they have a lot of cancers on the stochastic side... stating that their incidence is more predicted by cell division rather than the deterministic, preventable factors.<p>But as the WHO correctly stated, they are incorrectly analyzing this data as described in this paragraph:<p><i>These include the emphasis on very rare cancers (e.g. osteosarcoma, medulloblastoma) that together make only a small contribution to the total cancer burden. The report also excludes, because of the lack of data, common cancers for which incidence differs substantially between populations and over time. The latter category includes some of the most frequent cancers worldwide, for example those of the stomach, cervix, and breast, each known to be associated with infections or lifestyle and environmental factors.</i><p>The cancers grouped into the stochastic side overall make up a tiny percentage of all cancers and so by number/%/incidence, the deterministic side would be enormous if graphed appropriately. For example, their most &#x27;stochastic&#x27; cancer is pancreatic islet cell which only has 2500 cases/year in the US vs their &#x27;lung smokers&#x27; cancer which has >220,000 cases/year.<p>I mean they seem almost willfully blind to their incorrect conclusion. Environmental factors are HUGE and the cancers caused independent of those would not benefit from screening and environmental risk reduction--a fact we already know!<p>As a last note, the &#x27;most&#x27; deterministic cancers--inherited types--have to be agressively treated with screening, prophylactic measures and environmental exposure risk reduction, etc. You can read about a couple of the deterministic cancers they mention in this paper:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familial_adenomatous_polyposis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familial_adenomatous_polyposis</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynch_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynch_syndrome</a>",1424530827

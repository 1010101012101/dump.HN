11039560,comment,11033539,11038089,0,0,waterlink,,,"dalke, thank you so much for a such detailed feedback. I really like it. And I kind of agree with a lot of points. I will think how I can cover them in the near future!<p>> One of my issues with TDD is the &#x27;refactor&#x27; step, which is supposed to take place during green. One of the refactor transformations is &quot;Substitute Algorithm.&quot; I&#x27;ve always thought that was a huge loophole as the appropriate tests for a new algorithm can be quite different than the tests for the existing algorithm, but TDD says not to worry about that.<p>I think in this case, I would write new test suite for new algorithm, and then replace both old test suite and old implementation in one step. In case, when tests suite can be shared, it makes sense to re-use it.<p>> That issue is applicable here, as #3 really is a &quot;Substitute Algorithm&quot; refactor of #2. It could have started with the previous sort test cases, and shown how refactor the algorithm in the TDD framework rather than redo the code from scratch. So far I haven&#x27;t actually seen any of the TDD example walkthroughs do it, at least with a non-trivial example like sorting, so showing this might also be enlightening or at least novel.<p>I would like to research if that is possible. If it is, I will make an episode for that.<p>> A test case goal should be to convince people that the code works. The test cases here aren&#x27;t enough. For example, there is no test for when values are equal, and I don&#x27;t recall the spec saying duplicate values were disallowed. This is important because some broken sort implementations might get into a loop for this case.<p>Thank you for catching this, I wasn&#x27;t focusing enough on this point.<p>> If this were implemented in Python then there&#x27;s a maximum recursion depth. I think the worst case for this quicksort implementation is if the input is sorted. So I would want to try sorting 100,000 sorted to feel more comfortable. This sort of error analysis must be part of TDD, but it doesn&#x27;t really fit into the red/green test cycle because it&#x27;s a test you write when you expect the code to pass, not fail.<p>This can, actually, fit in red/green cycle. By writing a test that creates a worst case scenario of 100,000 sorted elements. And see it fail with stack overflow. And then fix it by randomizing element that is used for partitioning. WDYT?<p>> Also, from an API perspective, if the input is the empty list then this code returns the original list, otherwise it returns a new list. I would prefer to always get a new list, so I have a better idea of ownership.<p>Thanks for pointing this too. Next time I would add specific tests for that. In that case, it is reasonable to check it for empty, one-element and N-element array.<p>---<p>Now that I think about that, I will make an episode #4 or #5 a re-visit of #3 - with all these problems pointed out and fixed ;)",1454648355

11039536,comment,11034071,11034071,0,0,NamTaf,,,"I have noticed corner situations of the iOS UX degrade over the time I started with a 3GS to now. This degridation was most obvious when they moved to the new flat design theme. Here&#x27;s some examples:<p>1a) The title bar colour changing feature occasionally bugs out. It will show white over white, or some other non-contrasting colour. This happens with no particular reason as far as I can tell<p>1b) The title bar sometimes stays on top of a &#x27;fullscreen&#x27; app, meaning that for example you have the top title bar icons and text sitting over the camera display view. This happens with no partiuclar reason as far as I can tell.<p>2a) I have noticed that in the portrait/landscape rotation, sometimes the app veiw gets bugged to sticking one way when the screen display itself rotates. For example, All of the content of the app rotates back around to a portrait orientation but is still trapped in a landscape layout on a portrait display. This is rare but seems to have no particular cause that I can recreate.<p>2b) The above can sometimes happen in the camera app. When you rotate the camera the icons (flash, hdr, etc) rotate for you. Sometimes rotating it causes them to &#x27;stack up&#x27; on one another as if they adjust in one axis but not the other. I most noticably found this when I rotated having had the flash options open (force flash, auto, no flash) and they all collapsed to being on top of one another rather than closing that selection pane.<p>3) The &#x27;zoom back to home screen&#x27; animation sometimes interacts strangely with folders. In that the icons of the folder will do the &#x27;fly out&#x27; animation but only confined to the final size of the folder GUI box on the screen. It looks buggy and seems to be a corner case situation. I can&#x27;t recreate it when I intentionally open a folder > lock my phone > unlock my phone but I&#x27;ve noticed it many times so I should try to pay more attention to its causes.<p>4) Since iOS9, I can press my 5S&#x27;s home button to get the screen to light up and recognise my thumb print, but sometimes it will activate siri even if I press it very rapidly. This is a 5S that I purchased in November so I don&#x27;t believe the home button is faulty. My suspicion is the screen initiation routines on the 5S are a little laggy and sometimes the button registers as a press-and-hold for Siri.<p>5) Right now I have 2 &#x27;unread&#x27; emails in one email account, despite there not being any as verified by Outlook on my home PC and the &#x27;unread emails&#x27; folder which I added to the mailboxes screen of Mail. I suspect if I remove and re-add the account it&#x27;ll clean this up but Mail is the only place reporting 2 unread emails.<p>6) Some apps can have their text input boxes bug out, whereby I can&#x27;t tap the input cursor part-way back in the window and as I delete text it highlights words and goes wierd. I suspect this may be a buggy implementation in the app itself but I&#x27;d have expected that to be a pretty robust UI object, so I figured I&#x27;d include it.<p>Anyway, the above are just examples of the sort of lack of polish I&#x27;m noticing build up over time. As said, the biggest increase in it came when they switched to the flat UX design, because I suspect they created so many new UI changes that there were inevitably fresh bugs that had been stamped out in the old design. Nevertheless, a number have stuck around and it&#x27;s frustrating because I noticed more polish and less of these little rough edges back in the 3GS and even my 4S days on iOS5.<p>The biggest bugbear is that I don&#x27;t really know of an easy way to submit these bug reports. I guess I have to jump on the apple dev boards or something but there&#x27;s no nice way of going &#x27;here&#x27;s a bug, please consider looking at it or asking me for more information if needed!&#x27;.",1454647939

But given the elasticity of demand for something like oil, this will negatively affect the oil glut recovery by slowing demand.<p>Speaking as an Alaskan where our entire economy is driven by oil, our government is running a HUGE multi billion dollar defecit due to revenue shortfalls stemming from oil prices. We would like to see increased demand for oil to burn through the supply glut quickly to get prices back to at least $70 per barrel. Regardless of Obama&#x27;s plan it&#x27;s going to take years and years to get back there if ever.<p>The real issue is our state government can&#x27;t afford to operate without levying any new taxes on the general population. The cost of living here is already astronomically high, plus we&#x27;ve been in a recession since 2012, and a tax like this is not going to help our situation at all.<p>give it a few years and alaska may look like a ghost town. The fact that I am a programmer who works on federal stuff, my position is not really in jeopardy but the majority of my friends are engineers who depend on oil and gas. Worst case scenario I can take a remote job and probably get a raise for doing so.  Maybe then I&#x27;ll be able to afford a house up here haha.<p>Bottom line is the USA now produces as much oil as Saudi Arabia (albeit with more than double the operating costs). We are much larger than they are and far more diversified, so as a nation we are able to withstand this sort of thing but if you examine places like Texas, Alaska, North Dakota, Oklahoma etc this oil price situation is going to financially destroy hundreds of thousands of people and dramatically affect millions of us. Gas prices also are somewhat less elastic when sliding left on the supply demand graph. so even though prices are 1/4 what they were, we&#x27;re only seeing gas prices at 1/2 the rate they were. This means there is not as much of a benefit to consumers as you would think from these prices.<p>Worth it? who knows. No matter what alaska is in a world of shit.",1454647503

We had no buildings more than 2 stories in our district and those were residential, with no standpipes or any of that stuff.<p>OTOH, I guess most FDNY companies don&#x27;t respond to a lot of brush fires, or have to deal with a lot of urban/wildland interface stuff.

FDNY can usually rely on hydrants, whereas we had to do a lot of stuff with running tanker shuttles and drafting from dump tanks, drafting from static water sources (ponds, etc.).   And even when we had hydrants they would probably be further away due to the difference in spacing (ours were every 1,000 feet where they exist, most major cities have a &quot;hydrant on every corner&quot; or &quot;hydrant ever 500 feet&quot; or something policy), which mean longer hose lays, more relay pumping, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve sort of always seen the urban/rural difference as one of the main &quot;branches&quot; in the fire service (aside from paid vs volunteer).",1454646455

It&#x27;s an easy way of getting recent phone snapshots onto my computer for exporting or doing whatever I want -- without keeping them around forever.<p>My multi-select comment refers to this: double-click on a photo in the thumbnails. You&#x27;re now viewing an enlarged photo. Now there&#x27;s also a double-row of thumbnails to the left of it. You can use this double-row to navigate, but not to multi-select. You must hit the back arrow to get to the OTHER thumbnail view in order to multi-select. I constantly make this mistake, it&#x27;s so non-intuitive that you can&#x27;t multi-select thumbnails to (say) export multiple photos.. not in THIS mode, at least, you now have to hit a back arrow to do the exact same task!<p>I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;ve fixed this in Photos, but a big gripe of mine with iPhoto was its &quot;sharing&quot; behavior. If you deleted your photos from your computer, it ALSO deleted them from your &#x27;shared&#x27; sites; eg, Facebook or whatever. To me, this was absolutely asinine behavior as many of us use multiple computers, can&#x27;t store our entire photo libraries on them at all times, and so on.

If markets had their way, anyone could sell a product that claims to do anything else, and if the consumers cannot organize information and catalog what products are fraudulent then people are vulnerable to deception.<p>That already happens today, in our &quot;tightly regulated&quot; market. Wonder drugs or miracle cures or instant diets or self help books claim to fix everything and do nothing. Drop regulation and it gets worse. Consumers are simply bad at organizing information about businesses, though I would concede that might be partially due to an expectation that &quot;the government will take care of it&quot;.<p>Other things - environmental pollution / destruction (and other secondary costs of business), exploitative employment practices (particularly exploiting the poor and uneducated), using economies of scale to drive out competition, rent seeking, collusion, asset hoarding, and fraud all occur in a natural market and to varying degrees government involvement helps abate some - certainly not all, and certainly not perfectly - these anti-consumer effects of business.<p>You can look at almost any industry and point at gratuitous and stifling regulation, very often used as shut door tactics by wealthy market players who use force of law to stop competition, because playing in markets usually keeps you honest. Just because Uber is innovative does not exonerate them from how they are playing legal hardball just as bad as many of the companies that preceded them, and if given the opportunity would not erect the same walls to competition their fore-bearers put up.

I wish I had good answers to give, but it&#x27;s hard to give advice beyond saying that you should indeed look into auditing a graduate history of science course or two. I heard that U Penn just hired an historian of computing and I have the impression that the history of information and computer science is becoming kind of trendy lately. It would be worth looking around at the new faculty in the main history of science departments who study something you&#x27;re interested in and emailing them.<p>The whole question of how and to what degree having domain expertise helps understand the history of science is a pretty thorny one. Sometimes having technical expertise in the field you&#x27;re trying to study the history of (a cardiac surgeon reading about the discovery of the circulation of blood, for instance) can actually be a hindrance because it tends to create an &quot;well surely <i>I</i> could have thought of that!&quot; kind of attitude. I think this is on display in Weinberg&#x27;s writings on the history of mechanics and physics, where he basically calls Aristotle a dummy, etc. It leads to a smoothing over of the difficulties faced by people who had to puzzle out the problems themselves rather than read them in a textbook when they were kids. On the other hand, Weinberg&#x27;s book is fantastic on the actual content of, say, Copernican dynamics, because he&#x27;s basically a genius so he&#x27;s able to understand past scientific theories on a deep level that someone like me can&#x27;t.<p>The person who taught me history of science in grad school had a BA in physics and a PhD in history, which I think is about perfect for what&#x27;s required - he understood the underlying material on a technical level and had a good mind for it, but his graduate training allowed him to step back from the actual content and get a new perspective on its historical significance, something which a participant in the field itself might not be able to see. Now, as to what that significance actually is and what tools historians bring to bear on it, it&#x27;s highly dependent on what subfield we&#x27;re talking about. In this person&#x27;s context, his work lead from James Maxwell&#x27;s work on electricity to the study of telegraph cables as a force of globalization.

As someone who didn&#x27;t start with, and never quite understood, the OOP craze, the urge to make tiny pieces that have almost nothing in them is baffling. Arguments that it&#x27;s &quot;more readable&quot; are true only locally, and understanding a single-line method does nothing for understanding the system as a whole; a significantly larger amount of cross-file jumping (and often keeping track of a very deep the call stack) is a hindrance. I suppose they do this because it gives the feeling and appearance of being highly productive, when they&#x27;re really just making things more difficult for themselves and others by bloating the complexity.<p>The other annoyance that I often encounter at the same time is terribly long and redundant variable names, accompanied by an overdose of design patterns. (&quot;Was it the FooFactoryInterfaceAdapterList or the FooFactoryInterfaceList that particular method was in?&quot;) An example from this article&#x27;s code is GetMasterVolume() vs. GetMasterVolumeMute() --- GetMasterMute() is just as descriptive, especially when the class is already named AudioManager. There&#x27;s no GetApplicationVolumeMute(), instead it nicely appears as the more succinct GetApplicationMute().<p>I know there are IDEs which will help you go to the right file, but it&#x27;s still not as easy as just scrolling through a larger one and reading linearly. That said, excessive code duplication is to be avoided and best replaced with a function; the code referenced in this article shows signs of that, as I easily saw this fragment repeated many times, among others:<p><pre><code>    ISimpleAudioVolume volume = GetVolumeObject(pid);\n    if (volume == null)\n        return;</code></pre>",1454645837

11039303,comment,11034071,11034071,0,0,breatheoften,,,"I&#x27;ve see a lot of talk from various places that the &#x27;issue&#x27; with the decline in software quality from Apple stems from &#x27;changing too much, too fast&#x27; -- I think its actually the opposite -- not changing enough and not changing it fast enough.<p>There are going to be upgrades -- that is GOOD.  But we need to -feel- like there&#x27;s something new and better and worth the inevitable bugs that -change- is guaranteed to introduce.  Those who react to this problem of &#x27;change produces bugs&#x27; by saying &#x27;nothing should change&#x27; or &quot;don&#x27;t change what isn&#x27;t broken&quot; are inevitably in the wrong.  Change needs to happen, but more importantly the right changes need to happen.<p>iCloud is really confusing -- there is just no simple way to understand what it does, what its for, how to use it, how it can go wrong, what happens when it goes wrong ... and on and on.  It needs to be turned into something more modular with better boundaries between its unrelated aspects.<p>- iCloud needs to change faster.  In my opinion we&#x27;ve been on on a slow path towards an iCloud account being _required_ for OS X usage -- the slowness of this progression has drastically complicated the introduction of iCloud features.  In my opinion, doing iCloud right _requires_ iCloud to be present and configured.  Just pull off the bandaid -- require an iCloud identity for each user account and redesign the rest of the setting system to assume its presence ...  Re-implement the process by which all the system provided apps query for settings to use the new model designed to keep up with modern users expectations.<p>In my mind iCloud needs a new statement of purpose.  I&#x27;d propose this: iCloud is about:<p>- establishing identity of person for usage of apple services\n- establishing the ability to mutate configurations associated with that person on any device that person uses.  The other _services from apple should not_be called &#x27;iCloud&#x27;.  I&#x27;d like to see iCloud become:<p>- a screen which is ONLY about configuring &#x27;the iCloud account associated with this user&#x27;.  This should be about proving who you are to apple so that you can synchronize your other system settings to/from cloud and other devices.  Nothing else.<p>- The rest of iCloud should be folded into a generic interface to all &#x27;system integrated internet services&#x27;.  I imagine a screen designed to manipulate a data model that looks something like:\n Service Provider -> User Identities -> Devices -> Services<p>From one place I can configure my authentication credentials for various service providers, and then decide which services from each provider I want to enable on each of my devices.<p>The associated settings are synced to iCloud and onward to each device.  iCloud is one place to define all the system<->internet integrations for all your devices.  The implementation of those services is _not_ part of iCloud.  I should be able sit on my mac and configure which mail accounts I want my phone to check -- this is iCloud -- actually downloading the mail on my phone, not iCloud.  I think iCloud should implement a user-facing synchronized management console for describing the set of network service integrations to enable for each of my devices -- it should also expose an api by which applications can gain access to these service configurations.  That&#x27;s what iCloud should be in my opinion.  Its a lot of _change needed_ to get there, but no change here is worse I think by far...<p>I&#x27;d like to see apple change more about OSX -- change something low-level, long-lived ...  Do something controversial that forces the most ossified of unix curmudgeons to learn new tricks.  How about a new default shell (fish! ... something homegrown)!<p>My advice for apple: Keep moving the world forward, don&#x27;t go into maintenance mode, improve things that need improving, embrace the fact that not all change is churn.  Someone at apple needs to stand up for that mantra in the face of all this criticism and prove to the world that can still improve things by changing them.  That&#x27;s the only way this perception of &#x27;declining quality&#x27; is going to change.",1454644825

So it guarantees stable name->ip mapping for each container. As a result, when you point a service endpoint at another container, it&#x27;s the IP/container mapping that is changed, which is a much more reliable and atomic change. I would definitely never rely on changing DNS records to orchestrate changes to my production stack, that would be way too brittle.",1454644806

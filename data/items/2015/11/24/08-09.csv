10619780,comment,10614573,10618624,0,0,nrinaudo,,,"I fear I must be misunderstanding your points. Are you really stating that, in order to know what you can do with data, you need just need to inspect it at <i>runtime</i>? Or that types only protect you from typos?<p>Types allow the compiler to do a lot of validation before your code is even executed, removing whole classes of bugs before they even have a chance to manifest themselves. You thought that value was an int and divided it by two? It was a string. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to wait until runtime to find out about it, or to write tests to make sure that <i>every single code path</i> to that division results in the value being, in fact, an int.<p>Types allow developers to trust whatever data they receive without feeling the need to protect against hostile, or less experienced, application programmers passing incorrect data. They allow you to know, with absolute certainty, that what you wrote can only be executed the way you meant it to be executed (whether that&#x27;s correct or not is another question altogether). A function in a dynamic language is never complete, you never know what data, or shape of data, you will receive. Types buy you that certainty.<p>Code efficiency is not the point - developer efficiency is. When you can trust your data, you can focus on what your code needs to do - that&#x27;s usually complicated enough without adding the complexity of not being able to trust <i>a single value</i>.<p>The main argument against static languages is that, in their struggle to be sound, they end up not being complete - and it&#x27;s absolutely true: there are perfectly legal programs that you can&#x27;t write with a static language, but that a dynamic one would run without batting an eyelash. Duck-typing comes to mind, I&#x27;m sure there are other examples.<p>Another argument is that type systems get in the way of what you want to do. There are a few cases where it&#x27;s true - see the point just above. But in my entirely anecdotal experience, the vast majority of times someone complains the compiler won&#x27;t let him do what he wants, it&#x27;s because <i>what he wants to do is not correct</i>. The complaint is not that the compiler is too restrictive - it&#x27;s that your bugs are shoved in your face much, much more frequently and quickly than they would if you had to wait for runtime. And that&#x27;s a <i>good</i> thing.",1448354722

10619729,comment,10617308,10617308,0,0,chrido,,,"That&#x27;s not so surprising, the base rate is negative since more than a year. \nBecause of fear in EUR, many people instead of buying Gold, people bought CHF. One of my friends said: its a beautiful country and has a lot of assets, so there is not much of a difference. The SNB [1] fixed the EUR/CHF to 1.20 for quite long time until it was dropped suddenly at 15.1.2015. From one day to another all goods in the EU cost ~20% less for the Swiss people. As I live near the Austrian/Swiss boarder, there were many Swiss people coming over to Austria that time, buying as much stuff they could get and importing to Swiss. Main problem for the Swiss economy is that suddenly goods from Swiss companies are ~20% more expensive than competitors outside of Swiss. Or employees in Swiss are suddenly 20% more expensive if your main currency is EUR or USD. That&#x27;s bad for the economy.<p>On the 15.1.2015 they also changed the policy from fixed EUR/CHF exchange rate to negative interest rates to reduce the influx of money. Currently the rate at which the SNB borrows to the banks is -0.81% [2]. A friend of mine pays a premium of 0.75% on the base rate for his loan on the house, so the currently borrows from the bank at -0.06%.<p>So what else could you do with your CHF? Buy Swiss Confederation bonds, the current yield is also negative, -0.28% [2]. Or buy EUR, more risky but more interest? Put under your pillow, too risky? Exchange to gold, pay for insurance or to keep it safe? Bonds of a country nearby? Only 0.46% for 10 years in Germany [3] and in EUR.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.snb.ch/en/iabout/stat/statpub/zidea/id/current_interest_exchange_rates#t3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.snb.ch/en/iabout/stat/statpub/zidea/id/current_in...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.snb.ch/en/iabout/stat/statpub/zidea/id/current_interest_exchange_rates#t2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.snb.ch/en/iabout/stat/statpub/zidea/id/current_in...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.deutsche-finanzagentur.de/de/factsheet/sheet-detail/productdata/sheet/DE0001102374/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deutsche-finanzagentur.de/de/factsheet/sheet-deta...</a>",1448353723

Systemd does not <i>need</i> all those optional bits and is happy to work with syslog, ntpd, cron, etc. pp., can pass through sysvinit init files, and so on. If you actually use it instead of relying on fudy reports, it&#x27;s a breeze to work with.<p>Recompiling half my desktop, and then recompiling all userspace programs using any of the involved libraries, is <i>much</i> more invasive compared to that.<p>Another approach is looking at what you have to do when building a system from scratch: Here, systemd&#x27;s &quot;modification needs&quot; are obviously close to zero (because the system is built around it, you can use journald/timesyncd/etc. from start, or set up rsyslog/ntpd interoperability for systemd). Userland software might, at most, need unit files to use them. Desktop environments et. al. work without dedicated logind support or anything. Unity, however, still requires me to scrape together patches out of Canonical forks of various programs and libraries to get it to work.

Target a minimum of, say, 10$ user/year, or user/month (yes, those are two wildly different prices, and two somewhat different level of &quot;perceived value&quot; you&#x27;d need to provide).<p>Micropayments only make sense at massive scale - and you won&#x27;t have that starting out. If you cant build up to 10.000 users paying 10/year, you could probably sustain a developer. Just make sure that doesn&#x27;t generate work for 30 support staff. But &quot;breaking even&quot; (we won&#x27;t have to stop because we&#x27;re burning money on hosting) is different from &quot;making money&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s probably a good idea to one, or the other. Not something in the middle.<p>Major caveat: I&#x27;ve only thought about pricing models, never found the opportunity to try them out in practice.",1448352155

I&#x27;m not too bothered by the soap-opera effect in general. But the first football‡ game I watched on it made me turn it off in a hurry. The ball seemed to disappear when it was passed. The motion smoothing algorithm somehow ghosted it right out of the picture, so that it appeared to leave the QB&#x27;s hands and magically teleport to the receiver.<p>‡ Gridiron Football",1448352039

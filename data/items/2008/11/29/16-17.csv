For instance, Obama originally had this to say about forced labor:<p><i>Obama will call on citizens of all ages to serve America, by developing a plan to require 50 hours of community service in middle school and high school and 100 hours of community service in college every year.</i><p>Now all he says is this:<p><i>They'll [Obama and Biden] set a goal that all middle school and high school students engage in 50 hours of community service a year, and develop a plan for all college students who engage in 100 hours of community service to receive a fully-refundable tax credit of $4,000 for their education.</i><p>(Both from <a href=""http://change.gov/americaserves"" rel=""nofollow"">http://change.gov/americaserves</a>)<p>There are major, substantial changes being made here. There is also obfuscation going on, as you see above. Knowledge of what he previously wrote clarifies what ""set a goal"" means.

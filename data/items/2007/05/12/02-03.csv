Even their money was privately minted.  I was fortunate enough to visit before the hand over, and what an amazing place it was.  That tradition of freedom still lingers, but is being snuffed out.  Those posters hidden away in the temple would have been out in the streets in the earlier freer days.<p>Technology, like the search engine provided by Google, is giving the government the power to keep the masses from doing what they should do - overthrow the repressive regime.  Another Tiannamen square will come, and the regime will use any and all force to subdue it.  Their only principle is maintaining power - that has been their history and present and future until they loose power.<p>Comparing this to the US system is dramatically misunderstanding and utterly taking for granted the amazing freedom we have and the reasons for it.  The difference is in kind, not degree.",1178938470

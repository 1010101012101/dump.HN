10163646,comment,10142019,10163529,0,0,kgwgk,,,"Assuming no false negatives is just not an option :-) I think that can only happen if the situation is such that there can be no false positives either (i.e. the p-value when the null hypothesis is not true is always zero). EDIT: What I wrote is true only if the distributions under the null and the alternative are completely disjoint. You can actually have very low false negative rates if the distributions are not symmetric, and if you allow different distributions you can do even better: imagine the null hypothesis is x~Normal(0,1) and the alternative is x=C0=1.64 (exactly the cutoff value for 0.05 significance). If we get exactly p=0.05 then the probability of the null being true is 0%. I mean, we get p in [C0-epsilon C0+epsilon] with probability 1 under the alternative, but with probability->0 under the null as epsilon->0. Of course, this alternative is very unlikely and mixing continous and discrete distributions is always tricky. This is why it makes sense to make averages over prior distributions of the alternative.<p>As you can see in slide 14, there are multiple calibrations proposed under different assumptions. I agree it is misleading to give one as the &quot;real&quot; error I rate, but it&#x27;s interesting that all of them are giving rates well above the nominal alpha rate. EDIT: note as well that this is for the case where in 50% of the cases the null hypothesis is true(nowhere in the calculation of p-values do we consider how often the null hypothesis is true, but obviously if it&#x27;s always true 100% of the significant results will be false positives and if it&#x27;s never true 0% of the significant results will be false positives).<p>In slide 11 there are other calculations for the normal case, two-sided test this time. But instead of looking for the mu1 giving the lowest bound, they calculate the aggregate error rate making some assumptions about the distribution of the mu1. For example, if I understand correctly the results, assuming mu1 is normally distributed around mu0=0, if you get a p-value=0.05 (in the two-sided test, some modifications are required to the calculation we did) you should expect the null hypothesis to be true at least 32.1% (if the distribution of mu1 is very concentrated around 0, the 50% rejection rate on the left side of the chart dominates, if the standard deviation if very high the region of almost 100% rejection rate far from mu0 at the right of the chart dominates, for some intermediate standard deviation one will hopefully get the 32.1% lower bound).<p>Unfortunately, I think the assumption behind the nice result 1/(1-1/(e p log(p)))) is that p-values follow a beta distribution when the null hypothesis is not true and I don&#x27;t think there is a clear interpretation of that.",1441263332

In the meantime they might want to make their landing page work without having to enable JS.<p>EDIT (Thu Sep  3 00:30:36 PDT 2015): Actually on further thought (and reading), the whitepaper reads something like what I&#x27;d imagine somebody trying to troll the software industry would write.<p>Its core thesis is that the protection of intellectual property is what is necessary to have an industrialization of software. Nowhere is Open Source Software or the potential problems with having the entire build process created by a large distributed network brought up. There is no discussion of the potential security vulnerabilites that might arise, and without source access the impossibility of ever finding who introduced them. Also not brought up is reproducibility and support, if every change requires the entire network to be engaged again it is untenable as the networks composition of vendors will change over time.<p>Moreover the posturing about software joining the &#x27;ranks   of other legitimate engineering disciplines&#x27; makes this more in line with what one would read from the sort of personality that would accuse software shops of negligence for not using formal verification on the entire delivered program.

I should feel successful no matter what the judges decide.<p>My mindset from the beginning is that I won&#x27;t work on the project at all after the 24 hours allotted. It&#x27;s a throw-away project. This is really freeing. You don&#x27;t have to worry if the code is messy, or even if there is a fundamental problem with your idea (game mechanics, etc.)<p>My goal is to pick a new technology or library to learn and build something with it. Once, I decided I wanted to learn how to use OpenCV, so I made a little game that is controlled by facial tracking. Another time, I had just bought some USB Nintendo 64 controllers, and I wanted to make a game that used them, so me and some friends made a local multiplayer fighting game. (The projects almost inevitably end up as games). Another project we made a multiplayer game with WebSockets to fiddle with lag compensation and clock synchronization. I learned a ton of distributed systems stuff in that short time.\nSometimes, the technical problems take all time, and the finished game just barely counts as playable. Getting OpenCV bindings working with Java took nearly 8 of the 24 hours. Another project, using WebRTC for a peer-to-peer multiplayer game, only came together in the last hour, and stretched the definition of game so much that we won a special award &quot;for challenging perceptions of what games can be&quot; :).<p>It doesn&#x27;t really matter, because my goal isn&#x27;t really to make a great game, it&#x27;s to force myself out of my comfort zone to learn something new. The game is incidental, really. Sometimes, the judges are looking for something more polished, or more business oriented. That&#x27;s OK -- the game isn&#x27;t for those judges. I only invested 24 hours into it. However, I&#x27;ve been pretty lucky, so far -- most hack-a-thons I&#x27;ve been to really celebrate true hacks.<p>I think one thing organizers can do is emphasize the process of writing the code, rather than the result. Ask what challenges the teams faced, the hardest bug they fixed (or didn&#x27;t :). Near the beginning, try to offer workshops on different technologies, so that people can branch out and try something new.\nYou can also offer categories of judging -- if there is only one category, it&#x27;s hard to decide between an awesome business idea with little technical innovation and an awesome technical achievement with little applicability. No matter which one you pick, someone will be disappointed. But if there&#x27;s a category for best game, best presentation, best app, most innovative, best technical achievement, or whatever categories you pick, then everyone at the hack-a-thon can participate however they like best, and be recognized for it.",1441262107

The second chapter &quot;Do Nothingness&quot; has a chapter on procrastination specifically too.<p>Achieve Your Potential with Positive Psychology also includes a good chapter on CBT. The book also includes other findings/techniques in psychology that can help improve mood, motivation, relationships, etc. It also starts out by smacking down the Law of Attraction, which isn&#x27;t really effective - it&#x27;s more like an emotional pyramid scheme.<p>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy: Teach Yourself by Christine Wilding contains some good information too.<p>Outside of CBT, Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning, which defines logotherapy, is a damn useful book. Tim LeBon&#x27;s book also includes information on this.",1441260289

But if you could explain how those effects could have led to the unemployment and wage drops we&#x27;ve seen in Greece I would love to learn.<p>It seems to me there are two possibilities.<p>1.  When Varoufakis talks about  <i>macroeconomic models taught at the best universities feature no accumulated debt, no involuntary unemployment and, indeed, no money (with relative prices reflecting a form of barter)</i> he is talking about Keynesian.<p>Keynesian theory includes involuntary unemployment, accumulated debt, and money.  So Varoufakis would have to have been mistaken.  And he is shown to be especially confused when he later remarks<p><i>Moving to the micro level, the observation that, in the case of Greece, real wages fell by 40% but employment dropped precipitously, while exports remained flat, illustrates in Technicolor how useless a microeconomics approach bereft of macro foundations truly is.</i><p>This means he believes Keynesians are especially focused on microfoundations and ignore macro foundations.  When this is actually true of the Neoclassical school.  Then there is the issue you brought up.  Varoufakis critiques Keynesians at the beginning and then appeals to it at the end.  This implies he does not understand the basics of Keynesian theory.  This is very surprising because he thinks of Keynes as one of the economists that personally influenced him the most.<p>2.  Varoufakis is actually talking about Neoclassical economics.<p>This makes a lot of sense.  Many Neoclassical economic models lack money, don&#x27;t have involuntary unemployment, and lack accumulated debt.  In addition it is very hard to tell a story about large wage drops, and growth in unemployment from microfoundations(basically supply-side).  This means he is being consistent when he later appeals to Keynesian economics.<p>Varoufakis is obviously a very intelligent man who has spent 28 years studying economics.  I would be incredibly surprised if he was confused about the basics of the two most influential schools of thought in macroeconomics.",1441260283

It&#x27;s not like the Canadian economy used to be more diversified when the conservatives weren&#x27;t in power, if anything it&#x27;s the other way around.  We&#x27;re resource rich and naturally that is something that influences the economy.",1441260270

The Soviet Union before 1965 had high growth rates.<p>My thoughts are that when a countries central powers make good bets on human capital, infrastructure, and technology, then market economies can feed off of those and produce high rates of growth.<p>Brezhnev and his compatriots in the soviet union never let a vibrant consumer economy develop. And growth stagnated. Faced with the same problem in the early 80&#x27;s the Chinese Communists implemented market reforms. That combined with previous investments in human capital, plus sometimes heavy handed restrictions on population growth appears to have been successful. (Also the Chinese were able to cut a deal with the US and Europe to allow mostly unfettered access to developed world markets, which the Soviets didn&#x27;t have)",1441260080

You can make money a lot faster contracting for a big mining company than you can trying to develop a product, fund it, market it, and make profit off it.<p>I'd even go as far as to say it's cultural - we're less likely to take the risk - probably because the big reward (anything to do with the mining industry) is so low risk to begin with.  You even see it in other sectors - for example musicians over here are more likely to try making a living in a related service (music teaching etc) with guaranteed income than ""risk"" investing in their own music and trying to get big selling a product.<p>Tempted to move to NYC now and follow your lead!",1340862976

Indeed they fell well short of that. They were general warrants, and ash such, are invalid.""<p>The judge then goes on to say:<p>""Before I leave this topic, there is one further peculiarity about the form in which the warrants were sought and issued which I record: the applications did not extend to racketeering, or to conspiracy to commit copyright infringement. It included money laundering rather than conspiracy to commit money laundering.<p>Attached to the warrant was this document that stipulated what could be searched and seized by the authorities. It listed this particular part:<p>""All records and things in whatever form, including communications, relating to the activities of the Mega Conspiracy, including but not limited to, Megaupload, Megavideo and Megastuff Limited""<p>The judge says about this (in reference to Dotcom's lawyer I believe):<p>""I accept his submission that without definition of the 'Mega Conspiracy' it is hard to imagine what falls within this category""<p>Another juicy bunch of tidbits are these:<p>""Assuming then that the police were operating under a valid warrant, what were the police entitled to do in this case? There were required to conduct a preliminary sorting exercise at the premises, as the warrants could not authorise an officer to removed from the premises indiscriminately all documents and records. In this case the police faced the additional difficulty that they were not the investigating officers and had limited knowledge of the operation.""<p>""Given the state of knowledge of the police, it would have been proper approach for them to involve officers from the FBI in this exercise. Section 46(1) authorises the use by police of ""such assistants as may be reasonable in the circumstances for the purpose of the entry and search. Because assistants would have been foreign law enforcement officials it maybe have been prudent to have them as named assistants in the warrants authorising the search.""<p>""Providing the police act reasonable in so doing, following the initial sorting exercise, they were then entitled to remove from the premises those things which at the time they reasonable believed contained material which might be of evidential value.""<p>Short story is: the warrants were too broad, didn't accurately describe what the items were being seized for in relating to the offences and thus the warrants were unlawful not to mention the police technically weren't allowed to seize what they did from the properties in the warrants.",1340862419

Fortunately no other\n  user information was compromised and I am deleting the\n  mailing list.\n\n  For those of you who have donated to the Indiegogo project\n  I have contacted Greg and Indiegogo and it is being taken\n  down.

However, as many of you have\n  guessed, we have exhausted our capital and will no longer\n  be making any more WakeMates.\n\n  Currently our plan is to keep the service going while we\n  work on open sourcing the technology.

I have a visa to live in Germany and to work freelance for German companies but not as a fulltime employee. I approached it with very similar rationale as yourself (bringing money into the city can't be a bad thing, etc...) To get the visa I provided a well-written business plan (ca. 10 pages, translated to German) describing how I was going to make it here, proof of sufficient cash on hand to cover all my costs for well over a year, demonstrable German language skills, and two letters of intent to hire from Berlin-based companies. 200 euro and 7 days later with the help of an immigration lawyer I had the visa I wanted. Painless and cheap, when compared to some other countries. The visa requires renewal through 5 years at which point one can apply for permanent residency. Thankfully my German was good enough that I didn't have to take any integration courses.<p>I hear a variety of stories from people so I don't know what the norm is, if there is such a thing, but it's definitely possible to get what you're after.<p>I have private health insurance with dental, full coverage no deductible, from ALC-Allianz. I believe John G is ""da man"" in that category. Though you can also get it through Mike Woodiwiss at Spectrum (use the search) It costs me around 130 euro per month, which is peanuts compared to US insurance costs.

Component quality? Component selection?  Component handling during the build of the OC system?<p>An over-clocked system with inadequate cooling is definitely more likely to fail.  We have several over-clocked systems for FEA/CFD that have been rock-solid since they were built (about three years ago).  They generally run nearly 18 to 20 hours per day for weeks and weeks when we have such projects on the table.<p>All of the machines were built by us (I guess they call this ""white box"" now?).  Every single one of them was built in a static-controlled environment.  Every single one of them underwent full-load testing when built before being put into service.  In most cases this led to identifying memory that failed prematurely.  In other cases we've rejected motherboards and CPU's.<p>After a successful two week burn-in period the machines were officially deemed qualified for service.  Oh, yes, all of them had fluid-based cooling systems installed and oversized external radiators.  I forget what we aimed for in terms of CPU/Memory temperature, but it was definitely nice and cool compared to a normal heatsink setup.<p>Component selection, handling, build quality and burn-in testing are of paramount importance when trying to push the limits.  My guess is that most hobbyists don't do any of this and simply go for the shiny new object on the shelf and expect it to work.  That being the case, failure rates are sure to suffer.<p>The same applies to non-OC self-built systems.  I don't think that I have ever bought a factory built (Dell, HP, Compaq, etc.) system save laptops.  I can't remember ever having any hardware failures in, say, the last twenty years, save maybe one case of a hard drive that refused to spin after a few months of service (backups are golden!).  Again, component selection, handling, testing, etc. are of paramount importance when building your own system.<p>The other part of this study that I think needs data is the ""quality"", for lack of a better word, of the user.  How many of these users are Mom, Dad, Grandma, Grandpa and Uncle Fester?  How many of these are hackers and computer enthusiast?  I, for one, have never enabled the ""share crash data"" functionality on any of our machines in, again, about twenty years.  That's data from a group of users that are smarter than the average bear that MS simply does not have.<p>The data from factory-built systems is probably far more reliable because, well, they are a relatively known quantity.  There are still issues to consider, such as the operating environment (air-conditioning, temperature, humidity), air filter condition (full of dust or cleaned every few months), user cabinet incursions (did they install more memory and zap the MB with static?) and more.<p>I did not read the entire report.  I don't know if any of these points were covered or not.<p>The conclusions might provide a good approximation of what the average user might experience.  Without more data I would be careful about placing excessive weight on these findings.",1340861588

Adjust your schedule so it is absolutely to your liking - show up at 10 AM leave at 3 PM, etc.  Peoples careers should degrade gracefully, not come to a crashing halt like we've come to embrace in our society",1340861270

4170428,comment,4169847,4169847,15,0,cletus,,,"Firstly, congrats to the Atlassian boys. Whichever way you look at it, it's a great accomplishment.<p>This thread has turned into a discussion about startups in Australia in general and let me add some perspective as an Australian who now lives in the US (NYC).<p>Firstly, a disclaimer: I'm from Western Australia, specifically Perth. WA is different to most of the rest of the country (except maybe Queensland) in that it awash in the biggest resources boom probably ever. Iron ore and oil and gas primarily but others too (aluminium, nickel, etc). China is of course the largest buyer.<p>In many ways Perth, the capital of WA and a city of some 1.5 million, is a boom town and really two cities: the haves and the have nots.<p>The haves are in the resources game, directly or indirectly. The biggest indirect benefactor is construction. There is some $50B+ in infrastructure projects in the pipeline and prices paid for construction are just astronomical. This was worse in the housing boom (up to 2008) but is still bad.<p>My brother-in-law who manages construction projects (apartment buildings and so forth) says that to build a two storey brick-and-tile house is about $2,000+/m2 (roughly $200/sq ft). Single storey is still probably $1500. Apartments in West Perth (close to the business district but not much else going on) sell for over $10,000/m2).<p>The have nots are everyone else <i>including software engineers</i>.<p>Post-housing bubble and because of the high cost of entry to the market (you will not find a house in Perth cheaper than $250,000 <i>period</i> and I'm including rundown houses built 50+ years ago) and tighter lending practices by the banks (anecdotally, the wholesale cost of lending pre-bubble bursting was 20 basis points about the RBA rate, now 100+) rents are going through the roof.<p>A one bedroom apartment I rented in 2005 for $300/week is now $600+. There are far more extreme examples than this.<p>On top of this the cost of living is ridiculous. Food, utilities, you name it.<p>Basically if you aren't in the resources/construction game, you have experienced a drop in your real standard of living over the last 10 years. Commercial property is expensive. Everything is expensive.<p>One big problem Australia has (IMHO) is stamp duty. Stamp duty as it applies to most people is a state government tax on the sale or transfer of property. In the US instead you pay property tax (typically 1-1.5% of assessed value AFAIK). In Australia you might pay as much as 5% of the sale value in tax.<p>Now consider that a ""normal"" family home in Sydney or Perth might be $1 million. So if a family in Sydney wants to pick up and move to Perth they may be $80,000 in the hole (including agent fees and the like) before they even start... all for a job that might only pay $100-150k. This I believe really hurts labour market flexibility.<p>Through a combination of taxing property and not the transaction and lower overall property values, this is not a problem the US has.<p>I often joke to friends and family that it is cheaper for me to live in <i>Manhattan</i> than in Perth now.<p>This has several negatives when it comes to tech:<p>1. There is a strong incentive go to the US, Real standard of living is higher, jobs are more plentiful and so on;<p>2. The high cost of living makes bootstrapping a startup in Perth expensive and not very attractive. More broadly to varying degrees I believe this applies to a large part of urban Australia;<p>3. Perth at least has never really had a tech scene per se. The norm is for any sufficiently large company to headquarter itself in Sydney or Melbourne. The only exception are resource companies (Rio Tinto, BHP, Woodside Petroleum and the like); and<p>4. Because there is so much ""easy money"" floating around in resources it's just to justify a tech startup comparatively.<p>Plus there are usual reasons: Australia is far from everywhere (Europe, Australia, even Asia) and Perth is even further (it is I believe the most isolated capital city in the world and you need to go 3000 miles before you find another city above 100,000 people).<p>Startups don't start in a vacuum. There is an ecosystem that makes them thrive. Angel funding, VC, etc.<p>As far as regulation goes, I don't see any particular barrier here. Forming a company in Australia isn't cheap (~$1000 for a private company, more for a public). Financial regulation is much stricter such that operating in financial services is a difficult proposition because of regulatory burden. For example, I don't believe Mint.com could ever have started in Australia.<p>I largely discount the ""lack"" of government involvement. Businesses will grow and thrive largely independently of the government and it's not something the government tends to be good at encouraging anyway (just look at the whole Curt Schilling thing).<p>If I was going to do a startup today I'd go and hole up for 6-12 months somewhere cheap to get an MVP and then base myself somewhere with a decent tech scene, maybe NYC or Boston.<p>From what I read the housing market is just nuts in SF now. Attracting and, more importantly, retaining staff I imagine is difficult in the Valley now. So much so that I think I would skip it entirely.<p>Whatever the case, Australia would be pretty low down on my list.",1340860398

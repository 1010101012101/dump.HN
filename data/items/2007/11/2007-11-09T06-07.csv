If you are making a site to help entrepreneurs find co-founders, you'd better deliver on that promise: if people that use your site can't find a co-founder within 3 weeks of trying, they are not going to come back again.",1194591198

They reach conclusions through logic and analysis. Night owls are more imaginative and open to unconventional ideas, preferring the unknown and favoring intuitive leaps on their way to reaching conclusions. Social behavior diverges as well: Morning people are more likely to be self-controlled and exhibit ""upstanding"" conduct; they respect authority, are more formal, and take greater pains to make a good impression. (Earlier research also suggests that they are less likely to hold radical political opinions.) Evening people, by contrast, are ""independent"" and ""nonconforming,"" and more reluctant to listen to authority'",1194588575

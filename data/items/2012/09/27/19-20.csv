4582564,comment,4581995,4582486,4,0,kanaka,,,"For our original server, after the first full day after the HN post, we racked up an AWS bill of about $1.62. Most of that was in the first few minutes after the announcement before we implemented the user cap.<p>From earlier today for about 20 hours of run time: we had 13,000 successful connections to the server, 22,000 failed attempts to connect. The server is averaging about 100k per second outbound when fully loaded with 20 clients. With the quick improvements we made after the HN flood we got the CPU down to about 1-5% on a t1.micro when 20 clients are connected and interacting. The real issue for us is the bandwidth.<p>The server and protocol could be MUCH more efficient (visibility pruning, binary messages, etc). But it was something chouser and I hacked up over the weekend and it's now working quite well within the cap.",1348775989

If I correctly understand the thoughtful comments already posted here, the story is old, every buyer of a house sold under those low-price conditions has the same risk from any seller (and thus should inspect the house before buying), and there isn't even any proof of significant harm. If I discover that my car needs repair before the next scheduled dealer maintenance, am I going to post a petition on change.org and then have a link to that petition on the front page of Hacker News?

If you are not into .NET then I guess you are right, but if you are willing to learn .NET or are already familiar with it, then Cobra may be a nice tool. I recently had to write a small library for .NET and used F# for this (I don't like C# and didn't want to use IronPython), but Cobra could be even better fit for what I needed to do.<p>If you need Python on .NET there always is IronPython, which is quite well supported. I think Cobra was made incompatible with Python syntax to emphasize that it is not Python, it has different aims and philosophy - but I can be dead wrong on this, maybe it's just because author liked some syntax better...<p>That being said I really don't think syntax matters that much, even if it's very similar (or very different) to something you know already. I learned and use CoffeeScript with pleasure even though it's syntax is similar - but not compatible - with Python's. Given a good syntax highlighting plugin for Vim, which I use as my editor, I have almost no problem at all with switching from Python to Coffee mode - when I end an if statement with "":"" it gets highlighted as an object literal and then I instantly know it's wrong. On the other hand I use OCaml and Racket for some of my side-projects and similarly I don't miss much of Python's constructs. I think it is more important for syntax to be consistent than to be familiar or similar to something. I just don't understand marketing languages as ""similar to C"" in syntax, who cares?",1348774865

Modified the game somewhat and created Pokemonium. They have currently about 40k accounts in the game about half of what we had when we got our C&D. They are making money from ads which we never did and they have just modified our game, actually made it even buggier than it was.<p>They are not distributing the source code so they are breaking our GNU Public License.

He has been to dozens of different countries, including the Asian country where I met him. He has not been back to any part of the United States in the last five years, during which time he has been to multiple countries of varied cultural and political background. His reaction to the Wikileaks publication of United States diplomatic ""cables"" was that his respect for United States diplomats increased enormously. That is my reaction too. United States diplomats have to deal with other governments all over the world, many much more treacherous and duplicitous than the United States government has been even at its worst. Those of us who are Americans who have been abroad, and who thus are especially aware of the consequences of US actions abroad, certainly have our own criticisms of United States policy. We also criticize the actions of United States persons who violate some United States policies, to the harm of foreign persons. But if Wikileaks wanted to so something both constructive for world peace and likely to elicit even more surprised outrage, it should turn its attention to the classified documents of China, of Iran, of Russia, of North Korea, of Belarus, of Venezuela, and of various other dictatorial regimes around the world.<p>AFTER EDIT: The reply two levels down by pdonis correctly summarizes the single standard I apply to all governments: they all ought to act morally, they all fail to act morally from time to time, I oppose all of those failures, and I would especially like to know more about the activities of governments that don't subject themselves to the discipline of free and fair elections, even if it means an organization like Wikileaks has to reveal their secrets.",1348774385

This way I am not playing hourly billing games, the client doesn't feel nickle and dimed and if I can finish in 20 hours, I have more time left to do other work.  This makes my hourly rate much higher than what most smaller businesses would pay.

Foreclosures and certain types of investment properties don't come with this, because, well technically the seller wouldn't be aware of anything in most cases. It's standard procedure. If there is any complaint to be made here, it might be one of willful negligence on the part of FM, but again, it says right there in the contract and the listing: do your due diligence... no seller's disclosure provided. I've seen foreclosures much worse than this one.<p>Really, due diligence should be the buyer's responsibility and if they want the seller to pay for any testing, it should be put it in the contract. Again, if FM knew about this ahead of time, I'm sure there are already laws in place to protect the buyer. If FM didn't know, then no one is at fault.

It also assumes that the current recession is caused by people's fears, and if they could only <i>think rationally</i> things would go back to ""normal"".<p>That's fundamentally flawed.<p>You can't be frugal when what you are is better described as poor. I know it's difficult for the boomers to understand this, but their ""normal"" is in fact a grand exaggeration that is not-sustainable. The average American carries far too much debt, live well beyond their means, and has enjoyed historically low interest rates.<p>The reality is that this debt needs to be repaid, if not at this moment, soon enough. All we've done to ""correct"" this recession is throw money at the worst parts in hope that it all goes away. At best, all that we've done is delay the inevitable accounting that must be done.<p>Prices are too high - across the board - for the average wage. People cannot sustainably live middle class lifestyles on the average wage.  Even better, people's idea of what constitutes a middle class lifestyle has been inflated into a unmaintainable ideal.  That needs to adjust, and it's going to hurt whether we like it or not.<p>The problem with bailouts and such is that all they do is pass this eventual day of reckoning down to the next generation. (I suppose that fits with the boomer ""me"" ethos perfectly, after all.)<p>The problem with articles like this is that they live in some sort of fairy land where people are still able to spend more, and just choose not to.",1254848218

If very few women are getting in at the top of the funnel it stands to reason that even fewer will come out at the bottom.<p>To change this you have to change the relationships at the top, the rest will follow.<p>If I would approach the females in my environment with the proposition of starting a business on a shoestring budget with a potential pay off in 3 to 5 years and a very high chance of failure most of them - if not all of them - will decline, but they'll be happy to be employees.<p>For males, using the exact same proposition the situation would be much different. As long as that's the case this situation will persist. You can't make people want to be entrepreneurs and risk takers, everybody makes their own decisions.<p>Those women that I know that are successful in business are probably better at what they do than the men, still, none of them would ever think of joining a fund or funding seed stage start-ups. The risk does not match their profile. They want to control the businesses they invest in. Gambling does not seem to be something that they wish to pursue. And it seems to work well for them, they appear to be much less under pressure than their male counterparts in the same lines of business.

They could make more money doing something less sexy, so they're self-selected enthusiasts.<p>- My game projects tended to be under one year, with high pressure, clear goals and a definite deadline. This, and the general culture of the industry, encouraged lots of crunch time, and made any code philosophy other than churning out code asap hard to adopt.<p>- Driven by both their motivation and the project conditions, good game programmers are awesome at creating a lot of decent code very fast.<p>So, judged purely on coding game programmers tend to be pretty strong. The trade-off is that there are a lot of skills they don't have to develop that you need in the web world. The whole mindset of <i>everything</i> (apart from the HTML rendering) running on a machine you control changes things fundamentally:<p>- It's far easier to deploy fast and deal with problems as they arise, rather than coding and testing defensively to avoid them in the first place<p>- Optimization is a completely different beast. You now control the hardware side of the equation too, so the old habits of improving performance can lead you astray<p>Anyway, this isn't as clear-cut as I'm painting it (I'm sure MMORPG guys have a lot more in common with web developers for example), but who's 'better' definitely depends on which dimensions you're looking at.",1254847938

Most authors abuse notation every chance they get (""syntax sugar"", maybe) though the good ones are conscientious about this. The difference is that Math is fundamentally a human language.

The hitch in this was, of course, the fact that one had to cram all this stuff into one's mind for the examinations, whether one liked it or not. This coercion had such a deterring effect [upon me] that, after I had passed the final examination, I found the consideration of any scientific problems distasteful to me for an entire year. In justice I must add, moreover, that in Switzerland we had to suffer far less under such coercion, which smothers every truly scientific impulse, than is the case in many another locality. There were altogether only two examinations; aside from these, one could just about do as one pleased. This was especially the case if one had a friend, as did I, who attended the lectures regularly and who worked over their content conscientiously. This gave one freedom in the choice of pursuits until a few months before the examination, a freedom which I enjoyed to a great extent and have gladly taken into the bargain the bad conscience connected with it as by far the lesser evil. It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry; for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need of freedom; without this it goes to wreck and ruin without fail. It is a very grave mistake to think that the enjoyment of seeing and searching can be promoted by means of coercion and a sense of duty. To the contrary, I believe it would be possible to rob even a healthy beast of prey of its voraciousness, if it were possible, with the aid of a whip, to force the beast to devour continuously, even when not hungry, especially if the food, handed out under such coercion, were to be selected accordingly.""<p>""Autobiographical Notes,"" in Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist, Paul Schilpp, ed.

Even the ""advanced"" courses had little to offer, I either already knew it, or it was trivially easy for me to deduce or learn.<p>I did, however, have one lucky point that many of these stories seem to be missing: a large number of my teachers didn't care what I did, as long as I was able to keep up in my classes. This meant that all through middle school and most of high school, rather than pay attention in class I would read some place in the realm of 1000-2000 pages a week, usually of various types of fantasy or science fiction books. I also had a handful of teachers who encouraged me to work on any problem I found particularly interesting, suggesting that I keep working on it well past the point required by the course.<p>I personally believe that is the way that any sort of gifted student should be taught. The current remedial->""regular""->advanced set of curriculum seems to work fairly well for those that fall into those categories, and by encouraging those above the advanced level to work on their own, above and beyond the classwork, on what they find interesting, you manage to meet their educational needs too. I am strongly against home-schooling and private schools, at least for those on the highest end of the intellectual scale. Any sort of educational situation where your entire peer group is of the same intellectual capacity leads to later problems. You develop the mindset that everyone is exactly like you, and that they have the same abilities and capabilities of yourself. Anyone who does not share your abilities becomes inferior, and you are able to de-humanize them.<p>Its mostly anecdotal, but with few exceptions ever single I have met who was home schooled, went to a private ""gifted"" school, or was in the IB program (which, at least in our area, segregates a public school into regular students and the IB students, and the IB students rarely, if ever, encounter the other students through the course of a day) has had a negative view of anyone with other skills and abilites, or at least those that have abilities that were not present in the peer group they were schooled with.

I've learned since then that it doesn't help me actually understand the project.<p>Also, the use of sequence numbers (hg has the same problem) causes a lot of confusion.  Humans seem to like the idea that there's an easy to understand sequence, but that's false on any project with more than one developer.<p>Specifically I had this problem with ""buildbot try"" -- the default implementation does a working-tree diff against the same revno upstream (e.g. if ""bzr version-info"" says 571, then it uses ""bzr diff"" to create a patch and sends it upstream against 571).  However, if I've committed locally (because...that's just the right thing to do), then it will find either than upstream doesn't have a 572, or it's a <i>different</i> 572.  Enter ""bzr revision-info -rsubmit:"" which introduces network (took 7.49 seconds for me just now) and ""bzr diff -rrevid:[long-string-i-can't-double-click]..""<p>I can't tell you all of the <i>exact</i> scenarios that were causing me confusion, but they came down to things like the above.",1254845739

But I also have a few friends that seem to play 50 games for every status update they post. I wonder if there are two groups of Facebook users, one that mostly chats and one that mostly plays.<p>That's how I tend to think of it at least. So if I were trying to make a Facebook killer, I might attack one of those two groups... provide either a vastly better social/chat/discussion/link-sharing scheme or a vastly better scheme to play games. But I don't have any ideas on either -- they both work pretty well apparently (the completely technophobic all have Facebook pages at this point!), which makes me think it'll be really tough to compete with Facebook.<p>And, besides, if you did compete that way, you'd still be at a disadvantage because of the network effect and that you appeal to only a subset of the existing Facebook crowd -- as I said, I don't play a lot of games, but I still want to be friends with people I remember from high school and that do.",1281801370

I don't think I will have any contact whatsoever with my biological family after this year. It's not just one sided, but they've made it pretty explicit to me.<p>On one level it's really hard to deal with, but on the other it has taught me things in a small period of time which usually takes decades to settle in. I've learnt how to sense emotions, and whether or not I can trust someone. I've learnt the difference between anger and deep seated hatred. I've learnt the difference between the storms that pass and an eternal jupiter-esque red spot. I've learnt so much that I simply can't condense it into words, let alone a comment.<p>No matter what I have gained though. I still wish that things weren't like this. Everything has taken it's toll on me. The most direct result is that I have deep seated insecurities and fears about things like rejection, failure etc. The most worrying result is that a part of me, no most of me, is just old and dead (the other part increasingly vanishing part is roughly 13). As someone pointed out I am 18 and I talk like I am in my 30s & 40s. What worries me is that I really can't remember the last time I had a genuinely happy day. It's like I can't have fun. Everything from conversations to thoughts just spiral down into that survival mode. I hate it, but it's almost a part of me now and I can't imagine an existence without it.<p>So yeah life sucks, but at least I have a family that helps me to deal with it. Does it truly matter what's in their veins?<p>P.S. - I can tell that you've been through a lot of pain yourself. Is there any way I can help you to deal with it?<p>Take care.",1281801124

So let me jump in on this side.<p>The question is not opportunity vs. self-validation, it's opportunity vs opportunity.  If you believe in what your doing, and you can keep chugging along doing that, that's what I would do.  Thank the company for the opportunity but tell them you are committed to your startup, they will respect that. And if they don't, you probably didn't want to work there anyway.<p>On the note of experience. At the job you are being offered, most likely you would gain specific technical experience. But you get hordes of experience from running a startup too. The startup experience tends to be on more of a macro level and you will find it useful in many aspects of your life. Running your own company will force you to put on lots of hats and give you a more complete look at how things fit together on a grander scale.<p>Not saying that the job experience is not valuable.

Where possible, allow your gut/subconscious some time to integrate what's been taken in.<p>Being in general proactive can help in this regard.  You aren't rushing at the last minute to assimilate everything.<p>There's the balance, you don't have to turn everything in as far ahead of deadline/necessity as possible.  And with respect to that, often conditions and requirements change anyway, requiring adjustment.  But by tuning in early, you give your whole self time and space to work on the problem.

1603403,comment,1603027,1603235,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"Slightly OT, but I think we/society needs to find a better word than ""sacrifice"".  To me, it invokes too much of an image of giving up power and of one-way giving.<p>I've had this conversation with friends (as a conversation, I mean, not an accusation nor negotiation), and usually there is agreement.  At the moment, I feel I'm not recalling our best substitutes, but I am thinking of the word ""contribution"".  We contribute to relationships.  Like an investment.  We put in something of value and hope/expect to grow that investment.<p>Like an investment in work you enjoy, it should -- on balance -- not feel like a burden.  And all parties need to be contributing.  Contributions may vary; at times, one may have more to give while another has less.  At times, someone may need to borrow a bit of equity, e.g. when they are acutely ill.<p>It's when, over time, the contributions/investments do not balance, that we need to have concern.  Those are not sustainable relationships.  Unless, perhaps, they are offset by other relationships and we chose to accept this trade off.  For example, when a family member is seriously ill, we don't necessarily withdraw our support.  Friends help to balance the equation and get us, and indirectly so also our family member -- who is relying on our support -- through.<p>I don't see sacrifice.  I see collaboration.

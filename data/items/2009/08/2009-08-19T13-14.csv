But can the application be genericized enough to cover all of the shopping domains without being completely washed out?<p>Think about the different kinds of web content that you read when making buying decisions. Off the top of my head, there's recommendations/searches (to discover things), consumer reviews/ratings (to evaluate them) and expert ""buying guide"" type articles (to gain a deeper understanding of a non-trivial decision). Currently, using all of these sources involves a lot of Googling and jumping from site to site. What if a single site could encapsulate all of them?<p>This site would aggregate prices and host reviews of individual products. Products could also be tagged as belonging to any number of ""aisles"" of varying degrees of specificity like ""Sporting Gear"", ""Wall Sconces"", ""Gifts for Mom"", ""2 Inch Tapered Drywall Screws"", ""Eco Friendly"", and so on. The aisles would be user created and could be just about anything. Individual users can have their own personal aisle for things they own or want. Stores can have their own aisle too (which would be a likely area for monetization). Each aisle would have a hub page showing the highest rated products, sub-aisles and related aisles, external links, and user written guides, faqs and whatever else they want to write. The idea would be to make the content model flexible enough to adapt to the needs of any special domain and to the different situations consumers find themselves in.",1250686913

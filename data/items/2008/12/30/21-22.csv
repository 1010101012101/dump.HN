414730,comment,414564,414564,0,0,biohacker42,,,"<i>In one test Charles was shown a pair of digits and asked to name the larger number. The bigger the gap, the faster most people can do this: they say “nine” faster when shown 9 and 2 than when shown 9 and 7. But with Charles, the reverse was the case—and the researchers could see why. Rather than telling the answer directly, he was counting on from one number (on his fingers) until he got to the other, which meant he must have started at the smaller, or he got to ten, in which case he must have started at the bigger. Most strikingly, he lacked the fundamental numerical ability possessed by most newborns: being able to tell the number of objects in a small group simply by looking. When asked how many dots were on a sheet of paper, he counted on his fingers—even when there were only two.<p>Charles’s deficit, though severe, seemed to affect his numerical abilities alone. Numerical deficits in people of otherwise normal abilities can be even more striking in cases of brain damage. Lisa Cipolotti, a neuropsychologist, studied a Signora Gaddi, who used to run a hotel and keep its accounts. After a stroke she could find the number of things in a small group only by counting—when asked how many arms a crucifix had, she got Dr Cipolotti to hold out her arms so she could count them. Signora Gaddi’s problems seemed to affect only numbers. She could still read, speak and reason, remember historical and geographical facts, and order objects by their physical size.<p>In fact, Signora Gaddi’s difficulties went even deeper than Charles’s. The stroke which damaged her innate understanding of small numbers also robbed her of the entire numerical edifice built on that foundation. For her, numbers stopped at four. When asked to count up from one, she got to four and no further. If there were more than four dots on a page she could not count them. She could not say how old she was or how many days were in a week, or even tell the time.</i><p>Scary.",1230674310

414716,comment,413047,413871,0,0,rcoder,,,"""OK, I think I get the advantage in terseness and power relative other static languages. Does it, or how does it, give you any of the other advantages of Duck-typing (such test functions that equally use mocks, stubs or the real objects?""<p>First, having a robust type system (whether simplified for the programmer by the presence of type inference or not) makes a large number of the types of tests performed in scripting language code unnecessary. Return types, errors raised, bounds checks, etc., are all implicit in the type signature of a function, and so do not need to be checked.<p>Secondly, at least in a pure language like Haskell, stateful code <i>must</i> be delimited via monads. Good program design dictates that you make those stateful components as small as possible, which then allows you to test the remainder of your code without resorting to mocks and stubs at all.<p>As a basic example, instead of passing a mocked file handle object between multiple methods, you might change your API to use a sequence of strings representing lines in the source file. At test time, you can simply pass any such sequence to your functions rather than mocking or stubbing all the potential behaviors of a ""real"" file.<p>That being said, your real question seems to be, ""can I substitute X for Y, as I can in Ruby/Python/etc.?"" My answer to that would be ""yes, as long as there are (potentially trivial) implementations of all the required functions in the typeclass(es) of Y that we care about.""<p>Haskell typing, at least, acts a lot more like an abstract interface than a concrete class, and a single datum is likely to be a member of many different typeclasses. However, each parameter to a function is constrained by a single typeclass, so you need not provide for every possible operation on a piece of data in order to mock it for testing.",1230673495

Suppose the government raised the federal minimum wage to $50/hr.  This would cause massive unemployment (and, no doubt, a thriving black market for labor), but some lucky low-income workers would keep their jobs.  You could then point to one of those workers and say, ""Hey, I know someone who has a high-paying job that wouldn't exist but for the new minimum wage.""  But this ignores the damage done to everyone else through unemployment and higher prices.  And so it goes with your lucky grandparents.<p>You can avoid these sorts of errors by consistent application of the following rule:<p><i>The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.</i><p>-- Henry Hazlitt, <i>Economics in One Lesson</i>\n<a href=""http://jim.com/econ/contents.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jim.com/econ/contents.html</a>",1230672961

Also, you'll need to explain how ""sky high rents + abandoned buildings"" corresponds to ""Why renovate when you can't charge rents commensurately?"" - if landlords can't charge rents commensurately, where are the sky high rents coming from?<p>The argument that rent control prevents owners from maintaining their buildings is pure bullshit.  There's not a rent-control law in existence that doesn't allow annual increases sufficient for maintenance.  Buildings aren't maintained because the owner sees the opportunity for dramatically increased profits if the current tenant leaves and lets the building fall to shit in an effort to drive them out.<p>As for why allowing people to stay in their homes is a good thing (and forgive me for being sentimental, but these are their homes, even if other people own the buildings - they do live there):  there a few things that bother me about the free market religion:<p>1.

Pure interpreters are fine, since they don't do any runtime bytecode emission, but the faster, more mature implementations tend to compile their source to bytecode at runtime. That won't work on Dalvik, since the Java bytecode->DEX translation tool is only available on a system running the SDK, not the handset itself.<p>One solution to this would be to create a self-hosting Dalvik DEX translator, so that apps running on an Android device could generate bytecode on the fly; another would be to switch to pre-compilation of your JVM-hosted language, with all runtime code evaluation handled via a simple interpreter.<p>An interesting example of the second type is Scala -- the Scala compiler generates class files directly, which can then be converted for use in Dalvik on the development host.

I'm British but I now live in California.<p>Tesco's data mining is easily the biggest operation I've ever seen. Everything I did at Tesco had a large clubcard component. The clubcard was one of Tesco's major innovations in Britain. It's not dissimilar to a Safeway card. Tesco issue these things in keyfobs as well as card so you always have them.<p>I've seen people use their clubcard when they buy a newspaper. They don't save money, they don't even get points, it's just habitual.<p>You can tell Tesco have really nailed data when you see their customer demographic. I saw something in the Guardian (British newspaper) a couple of years back which showed the Tesco customer wealth demographics matching the population norm almost exactly.<p>When a retail group can organise their stores and retail inventory such that every walk of life uses them they are on the road to success. Most people I know in Britain that don't shop at a Tesco as their primary store have competing store much closer to where they live.",1230671106

It indeed seems that there are structural differences considering marriages/coupling in US vs Russia.<p>From what I read, it looks like in US divorces are a way for people to try to find a better match. People shuffle themselves among marriages.<p>While in Russia, it looks like there are some men which leave behind them trail of divorced women (with children) that do not remarry. Thus there must be many men that never marry/reproduce. If this is true, it would be rather disturbing, as it would create unstable society.",1230670825

We’re currently advertising Highrise on The Deck, for example.<p>I don’t have anything against advertising, but we’ve found better ways to get our message out than spending money on advertisements.<p>I like what Amazon.com does: Instead of advertising they give their ad budget back to their customers in the form of free shipping.""",1230670811

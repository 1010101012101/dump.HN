5059213,comment,5058723,5059060,11,0,csense,,,"> I guess lying in that scenario would fall under ""obstruction of justice""<p>Yes.  The police are allowed to lie to suspects, but suspects are not allowed to lie to police.<p>Lying is one of the main tools police use to manipulate suspects into giving up information or confessions.<p>Unfortunately, this means you can't trust the police under any circumstances.  You don't know what they know or believe about you.  You may not have been aware that something you were doing is a crime, and accidentally confess.<p>Since the police are allowed to lie, and they're trained, skilled and experienced manipulators, if you think you're helping them do good things and what you're telling them won't get you in trouble -- perhaps you are completely innocent! -- you have no way of knowing whether these thoughts are a correct analysis, or something they've carefully manipulated you into believing so you'll help them send you to jail.<p>The thin paper shield of the Fifth Amendment is really all that stands between just about everybody and prison, once the police and prosecutors have decided to go after you.<p>That being said, it's not that police <i>as a whole</i> are bad -- for every politician pushing harsh penalties to be ""tough on crime,"" every prosecutor who's trying to advance her career by maxing her ""lives ruined"" score, every judge who's receiving kickbacks to fill prison beds -- I'd say there are at least a dozen, and quite probably many more, dedicated law enforcement professionals out there who genuinely believe in truth and justice and putting their lives on the line to protect innocent people, and try their utmost to live up to those ideals.<p>It's just that, when you interact with them, you have no idea what type you're dealing with, what they believe or have learned about you, or whether there's some obscure regulation you've unknowingly been violating.  So it's safest not to take the risk.  Same principle as not talking to strangers when you're a young child -- for every sick pedophile or would-be kidnapper, there are at least a dozen, and quite probably many more, strange adults who are simply friendly ordinary people, but you just can't take the risk because the bad ones are so good at manipulating you, you'll have no clue until it's far too late.",1358236636

We have chosen the latter.<p>The horrible crime Breivik is convicted of is far beyond anything our lawmakers ever took into account, so this is a painful edge case, testing the bounds of our judicial system. Yet, apart from emotional outcries in the days and weeks immediately following the atrocities, changing the system has not been on anyone's agenda.<p>That said - if the authorities consider the rehabilitation to have failed, and the criminal is still dangerous after his sentence is served, they can keep him locked up for another ten years. And another ten years. And another ten years. But that is not punishment.<p>If he after 21 years is considered harmless he will be let out. And we must, reluctantly, accept that this is the price we pay for our low crime rates and low number of repeat offenders.<p>Michael Moore visited one of our minimum security prisons, where criminals may serve the last parts of their sentence.

When comparing erlang to akka recently, I found that erlang, indeed does a quite good job in delivering predictable performance (all on a very limited benchmark), while akka is less reliable in that regard. However, I did construct a very simple network topology that was as similar in both cases as possible, so that excluded features like routers in akka.<p>Akka's performance on average tends to be better, though (roughly same for pure message passing, the more work you add, the more Akka tends to outrun erlang.)<p>So, it's, as always, a tradeoff.<p>edit #2:
I regard erlang's scheduler to be one of <i>the</i> advantages erlang has: allowing all threads to progress at the same time is amazing. If you compare this with task based parallelism, backed by a thread pool of size N: only N threads are able to 'make progress', while in erlang, every process gets a fair share.

Shouldn't the goal be to achieve justice?</i><p>You will never understand any system run by humans unless you understand the incentives that the humans running the system have.  And those incentives are rarely what people claim in public.<p>In theory prosecutors exist to see justice done and the laws of the USA enforced.  In practice those laws are passed by politicians to give vested interests (eg the copyright industry) tools to accomplish what they want.  And prosecutors in turn are motivated to demonstrate their ability to secure convictions - the more numerous and stricter the better.<p>We are lead to think that courts are about justice.  They are not.  They are about creating a predictable (if arcane) set of rules understood by the legal profession.  This set of rules is based on a ritual verbal combat.  Originally this was a physical combat, and God was supposed to decide.  However all vestiges of the actual physical combat have now been lost.  (The last case that I'm aware of in any common law jurisdiction where a case was settled by willingness to engage in <i>actual</i> combat is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashford_v_Thornton"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashford_v_Thornton</a> in 1818.)  Ironically many lawyers and justices believe that an adversarial system actually does result in justice, while at the same time studying all of the ways to get the outcome you want regardless of the merits, and acknowledging the advantage that a good lawyer provides.<p>The whole system is complicated by the fact that it is in theory accountable to the people.  And from time to time the people do get upset enough at how things work that we put enough pressures to cause the system to be modified.  Thus we create the Constitution, which is supposed to limit power.<p>However the problem is that the limitations are inconvenient to those in power, so they are inevitably eroded.  Thus the ability of Congress to regulate commerce between the states, with the Indian tribes, and with foreign nations eventually becomes the power of Congress to regulate anything that touches on commerce in any way.  (Some of the laws that Aaron was charged under were justified in this way.)  Your Constitutional protection against unreasonable search and seizure is too inconvenient, so courts accept that your possessions can be sued, and since you're not being sued, you have no standing to protest as your possessions are seized by the government.  (This is not directly relevant to Aaron's case, but it is a travesty.)  And, of course, the people cannot protest what they do not know about, so government passes laws directly and indirectly that are not available to the people.  For example find me the law or regulation which requires that you show ID in order to get on an airplane - you can't.  (This is an issue that Aaron cared deeply about - see the PACER incident.)<p>Aren't these outrages?  They should be.  But apparently they are not outrageous enough for the public to try to change them.  And so the bar continues to inexorably move in the direction that incentives point insiders towards.<p>Sorry for the rant.  Apparently you hit a nerve that I didn't know I had.",1358233365

Loosening the laws -- or, as your political opponents will inevitably call it, ""being soft on crime"" -- is similarly difficult.<p>The most difficult question here is not what we want to change, but how to change it.",1358233299

Maybe I'm wrong but maybe Yahoo should have been focusing on (what I consider) their strengths: delicious, flickr, y!live, fireeagle, developer network, etc.<p>Competing with Google in a field where Google excels, without trying something VISIBLY/OBVIOUSLY different/better was a losing strategy.",1230256450

Internet access to any site not hosted on the mainland is unbearably slow (bad news for travelers), the subway has only one line and the cars are always crammed full, and many of the cars on the street are tin boxes with recycled bike pedals and tractor engines inside them. Granted, I was there before the Olympics, while they were still doing a lot of construction in the hope of impressing everyone. If you were there then, and got an ultra-modern impression, did you ever look off the tourist beaten path and see ultra modernity there? I'd be surprised.",1230255565

Personally if they spend more than 5-10% of the money on administrative expenses I don't donate. And BTW that cuts out the vast majority of the charities, I think (wild guess) that most spend around 50%, and some as high as 75% (police fraternities for example (again, wild guess)).<p>The newspaper example, I think, was more a case of the person not being upfront about it.<p>Also, I personally think that if the charity money did not go to him, it would go somewhere else. So by him consuming 50% of the donations for his own pocket he is reducing the amount of charity money in the world.<p>Others might disagree and say that if he didn't get the donation, no one would. So you might as well allow him to exist.<p>If that's your opinion fine. But I feel that even if the second case is the real one I <i>still</i> am not OK with it (but I think the first one is what actually happens).",1230255462

409879,comment,409562,409562,0,0,12ren,,,"<i>In the aftermath of a wave of criticism, his company collapsed.<p>One breast cancer charity that parted ways with Mr. Pallotta began producing its own fund-raising walks, but the net sum raised by those walks for breast cancer research plummeted from $71 million to $11 million.</i><p>But because his company collapsed, the true comparison figure that Mr. Pallotta raised became $0 million. As a business, it didn't succeed. And he's blaming the world. People often give to charities to feel charitable, and having a profit-motive undermines that - even if the result is that less money is raised. This is because people making donations are often fulfilling a need to give and help people - not by what is best for those being helped. The latter requires a kind of ruthless saint, quite different from the human motivation of brotherly love.<p>In contrast, ordinary businesses helps people, or else no one would give them money. A fantastic example of this is Grameen Bank ""microcredit"": <a href=""http://www.grameen-info.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogsection&id=8&Itemid=170"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grameen-info.org/index.php?option=com_content&#38...</a> Usury (interest for credit) has got to be pretty much the opposite of charity, yet it seems to do tremendous good.",1230254698

I'm not OK with them spending money to collect more donations.<p>For example if you want to hire an expensive but very very good organizer that will save the charity administrative costs greater than it costs to hire the person - no problem.<p>On the other hand if you want to hire someone who is really good at drumming up support and getting people to donate, that could be a problem, IF they are getting paid a lot. And I don't care that they will bring in more money than it costs to hire them. I'm still not OK with it.<p>How much is too much? I'd say a few percent - i.e. if it costs more than a few percent to bring in X number of donations, then don't do it. (Or if you do it let people know upfront that XX% of their money is being used to try to get more money.)<p>That's why I refuse to donate to pretty much any group that calls me. Paying for those calls usually costs around 50% of the money brought in.<p>There are some cases where the calls are by volunteers, and then it's OK obviously.<p>Take a raffle for example: some charities will award as prizes 50-80% of the money brought in. Normally I would not be OK with that, except that they are usually upfront about it.<p>Mass mailing: I don't know how much that costs, but if it costs more than a few percent of the money brought in, don't do it.<p>A ""for-profit charity"". That's where someone starts a charity, for the purpose of paying himself a nice salary. Suppose he pays himself 50% of any money brought in.<p>You might say: well there is still that 50% of the money that does some good, which otherwise would not have happened.<p>I don't agree.<p>I think that last case is the example in the article. He says to himself: at least I'm doing some good in the world, so what if I'm making lots. I (and I guess most other people too since he was forced to shut down) don't agree.",1230254692

(Or they did last time I checked.)  These two companies have 8 digit marketing budgets, massive connections, and industry clout.<p>Now I don't want to toot my own horn too much, but if you were to, say, Google ""[pick a subject] bingo cards"" right now, you probably would not see Scholastic on the first page.  Nobody at Scholastic just slapped themselves on the head this morning and said ""Oh, effity, we didn't have a Martin Luther King Day bingo activity today.  That was a missed opportunity!""... but I just did!",1232290763

Not all genes are equally important!<p>It is utterly unimportant that humans share 98.5% of genes with apes, or 70% with bananas.<p>It's the genes are not <i>not</i> shared that are important. It's those that cause the differences (between species or between humans), and thus those that are important.<p>Those 1.5% of genes that are not shared are orders of magnitude more important than the 98.5% that are. And the .1% are far more important than their numbers would indicate (although obviously not as important as those genes that divide species, but much more important than one tenth of a percent would seem to imply).<p>No matter how many times they say otherwise there <i>are</i> measurable, and important, differences between races. The fact that they can not understand them in genes does not mean the differences are not there, it means the geneticists don't know enough yet.",1232290623

439351,comment,439298,439298,0,0,amobilebiz,,,"Everything I read here I can relate to with big companies.  It seems once companies reach that 1000 employee mark the culture changes drastically.  I can also relate to how going from a private to public company can impact employee ""life"".  Not that money is necessarily tight or the company can not afford the ""perks"" they once gave to employees as a private company, but with being public comes added scrutiny and greater sense of needing to be responsible with spending.  The average Joe investor does not want to hear that employees are enjoying free meals when his stock drops $1.00.<p>On the other hand though, from reading these emails it seems most of these people went to work at Google with a preconceived notion that it was going to be different and that somehow Google was going to be this theme park environment.  As with any job at any company it is what you make of it.  If you take a job solely because you think you are going to eat/drink free everyday, have daily live entertainment, and going to work is going to be fun then you are taking the job for the wrong reasons.  Work should be fun, but you need to make it fun and not rely on the company or the culture to make it fun for you.<p>As for salaries, while I do not know exactly Google's salaries, I would be willing to bet that they are extremely competitive.  I do know that a starting salary is most often highly negotiable and the people that tend to complain about receiving a low salary are the ones who go in expecting to be offered some godly amount right from the start.  The other thing you have to weigh is the benefits or perks in relation to the salary.  For example, if you get to eat lunch and dinner free every day at the office then you are saving around $10-20 a day in food.  That adds up to over $200 a month or probably around $3000 a year in extra compensation you are receiving.  Just like the one person did comparing the job at Google to buying a luxury car with all the fancy options and extra cup holders, you have to compare the salary plus perks to your current salary with no perks.<p>I have been there, not with Google, but with a startup.  I went from government contracting, to a small startup as a very early employee, and then to Microsoft, and back to startup life.  I can say that once you are bit by startup life it is tough to move to a big company like Google or Microsoft and be truly happy.  The culture is not the same and to expect it to be is ridiculous.  That is why I am back in startup life now.  It is fun, fast, and everyday is a new adventure.",1232290077

One of the worst kinds of projects is writing an interface to a piece of software that's full of bugs. Another is when you have to customize something for an individual client's complex and ill-defined needs. To hackers these kinds of projects are the death of a thousand cuts.<p>The distinguishing feature of nasty little problems is that you don't learn anything from them. Writing a compiler is interesting because it teaches you what a compiler is. But writing an interface to a buggy piece of software doesn't teach you anything, because the bugs are random.

The generic .NET software shop pays for this kind of software - *nix people don't.<p>I've written a few more paragraphs about this, and subsequently deleted them. It all really boils down to one thing: it's a bad idea. A lot of fun to write, but there's no money to be made.<p>2.<p>It's very hard to get any kind of competitive advantage here. If your idea works somebody else will do the same thing and charge less for the service. Also you will spend most of your time managing your (invariably unreliable) overseas contacts, leaving you no time to do anything else. This seems to be the kind of company that is fun in the beginning, and then turns into a nightmarish chore.<p>3.<p>I kind of like this idea. You have domain knowledge here, and already a few potential customers (or at least companies that can give you some feedback.) It's a niche, and there's still money to be made.

Security in general is the kind of thing that is purchased relatively high up in an IT org. Not 100% clear if your idea would be in that basic mold, but if the model is that the tool runs against or sits on all servers, that would almost certainly be the case.<p>If you are in the ""enterprise"" space, that means salespeople, RFPs, support, etc and since all that costs money you are much more tied to a traditional vc model.

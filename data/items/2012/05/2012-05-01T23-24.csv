Of course the fewer customers you have means each has a greater proportional influence in affecting the direction of your product.  That is, assuming customer feedback is something you're interested in, which I acknowledge is not necessarily always the case.<p>If you would rather exert effort more ""constantly"" and gradually down the road, than the many customers approach is good.  Many apps which end up in this situation do so because of a massive user spike at the point when their app ""goes big"".  In that case, the short-term growth is clearly not gradual, but the long-term growth leading up to that point may be.<p>My personal preference would be a small to medium customer base to provide more tailored support.",1335916450

What you can do though is define a preferred namespace, e.g. ""preferred""; this would physically contain only those libraries that are recommended, and perhaps even forked copies of modules that only contain the <i>functions</i> that should be used.

Generally this will happen through a reduction in real versus nominal wages due to the documented stickiness of wages. Anecdotally, having worked at a private equity firm, taxes are an input into not only hiring capabilities at a firm but the wages and bonuses payable to those hired.<p>Regarding the time value of money, if a firm defers $1 in taxes today for 8 years it would need to earn about a 9.1% annualised return on that dollar to have $2 at the end of those 8 years, $1 for the taxes deferred and $1 to keep so that it is as if ""as if the tax was never owed"". Given that the S&P 500 had an annual average return of 3.46% (1.42% annualised) over the past 10 years your assumption that a 7-8 year deferral even nearly wipes out taxes includes a substantial risk assumption.

3916749,comment,3910261,3916294,3,0,ars,,,"There is no set type of post that gets votes. But the general rule is: Is it helpful? Does it teach? Does it detail interesting points? (If you notice all but one of the things that you posted that got points match those.)<p>Basically discourse. You don't always have to have super comments. You can just talk, and argue - you may not get points for it, but that's OK, and sometimes you'll be pleasantly surprised. And you won't usually get downvotes. Unfortunately sometimes you will (like the Linus comment). I've had it happen to me too, it's not pleasant but you have to ignore it. If you know your comment was good, then just accept it and move on.<p>(Small message to newcomers: Don't post anything provocative until you build up a Karma cushion or you may end up with a killed account. And you won't be told if that happens!)<p>Things like that picture you posted are just stupid. Reddit makes you think people like it, but actually people find it annoying. Or perhaps people like it sometimes when they are in the mood. But that's not what this site is for - different sites for different purposes.<p>Jokes also don't go over well, except in rare cases (apparently your rickroll was - but don't do it often, it's rare). The reason people dislike jokes is that they have a tendency to take over sites, and people are very worried about that happening here. But they are accepted rarely - which is exactly what people want - mostly good stuff with a small smattering of levity.<p>So when you have a joke, combined with a stupid sentence like the one in the picture you get massive downvotes. You may think that overloading the meaning of the words is the problem. But if you had written ""Was there quality of life before the internet?"" you also would have gotten downvotes since it's an empty sentence - if you want to talk about that then keep going, don't just raise the question (if you notice other people did in fact talk about this very topic). Putting that in a image instead of in text made it much worse, using ""lolcat"" made it worse. Combine everything (joke, image, empty sentence, lolcat) together and the downvotes are quite expected.",1335913352

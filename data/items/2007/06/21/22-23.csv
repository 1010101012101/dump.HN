It's hard to explain if you don't know Haskell, however the other way is to use Monads. I can't explain them, because I don't understand them completly myself. Anyhoo, good luck.",1182466745

Sounds like they were unable to use those products, --it's more than just the financial investment, it's the viral leverage as well.",1182464081

You give them a bunch of different categories of budget, and whether or not its a hard budget that you can't go over or a soft budget that can.<p>They send you a <i>pack</i> of credit/debit cards highlighting the category. Say a big red ""Eating out"" card, or a light blue ""Groceries"" card, etc.<p>All of these debit your bank account you've linked to the service (a la paypal). On the service you setup ""sub accounts"" (which I'll hereafter call accounts). These are debited when you use a card, but only up to the amount you've authorized for the month on hard accounts. If you have say ""33.49"" in luxuries, and you try to charge 36 bucks, it denies it and sends you a text, ""You only have 33.49 left in luxuries"". If you try to make a charge in a soft account (aka one you're okay going over, but that it takes out of a different budgets, say Groceries will take out of dinning out), the charge will go through, and take any of the excess amount out of the account specified as the overflow.<p>There would be a webapp and smartphone app that would show all these balances on all these accounts you set up so you could see up to the minute how much was left on the cards.<p>Basically, 21st century envelope budgeting with no book-keeping once you set the budgets, with cards that work on the web or in restaurants or at any store.<p>It would be useful to <i>everyone</i> who's bad at balancing checkbooks, or money management in general, from teens to just people who are too busy to really worry about it.<p>Please oh please make this system :OD",1306681146

Then you can tackle the next steps which may seems overwhelming initially.<p>From what you write it is often not clear to me exactly <i>why</i> you want to learn about those things you mention. You mention some cool technologies but what makes them cool? For me, knowing why I want to learn something tends to keep me motivated even when things get hard or I got stuck somewhere. Maybe that's a personal thing, though.<p>It appears there are two primary changes you want to make 1) Get out of your job and work in a more exiting setting, e.g. by learning Ruby/Rails and working in a startup using exciting tools and technologies and not feeling left behind on a job where your mind retreats. 2) The other concern seems to be long-term: gain a more solid understanding of the fundamentals of computer science and mathematics.<p>Outside of traditional university classes it seems best to pick specific problems (small projects) where you can practice newly gained skills. What do you find exciting , where do you want to apply your new knowledge? Robotics? Social networks? Computer graphics? Music? Sports or Health? Does mobile development interest you? With your background in Java, Android development should be easy to pick up, for example.<p>I think learning new programming languages is great, e.g. learning Haskell in university was mind-expanding, even though I have never used the language ever since. Keep in mind that you can only start with a limited number of new things without getting lost so pick your priorities. Consider clojure with your strong Java background.<p>You mention you feel lacking in fundamental algorithms but what is it, specifically, what you have problems with? Since you obtained our degree (albeit from an academically poor university) you must have some introduction to algorithms class, what is it you are missing? What kind of programmer challenges do you have problems with and what is it you can't do?<p>Are there many user groups in the area you live? I found going to local lisp meetups extremely motivating and there are often groups covering for example Ruby/Rails, Lisp, Android, Arduino, Processing, JavaScript,  You see what other people are using the tools for and will often get your questions answered right away if you have trouble with something.<p><i>Linux</i>: Getting somewhat comfortable with UNIX/Linux and the command line seems relevant to quite a few things on your list. You don't have to become a full-fledged UNIX-admin, don't set your own bar too high! Do you have Linux installed? In a virtual machine (e.g. VMWare Player on Windows, Parallels  on OS X)? Or as a dual boot option? If you don't have it on a Notebook, consider getting a cheap used IBM/Lenovo X61 so you can take it to user group meetings. I learned my basic Linux from mailing list discussions on open source projects or IRC but I'm sure there are some good books or tutorials that cover the basic principles, commands, and simple scripting.<p>By the way, I can only +1 learning jQuery and more SQL (I like Bill Karwin's stuff on the web, he has written a couple of books as well)!<p>(edit: my email is on the contact page)",1306680193

2596711,comment,2596459,2596459,6,0,matt1,,,"Quick anecdote:
About ten years ago I ran a prominent AOL hacking website called AOL-Files.com. AOL employees had admin rights tied to their screen names and the ones with the highest levels of access had to enter a SecurID token after they entered their normal account password. Since we were always trying to outdo each other, these high-level employees became a popular hacking targets.<p>Getting an employee's password and SecurID token was very difficult, as you can imagine. Most phishing attempts failed, but every now and then we found an employee who would enter their password and SecureID pin into a bogus website, which we then had forwarded to us so we could immediately log onto their screen name before the pin changed.<p>The most notable hack was when BMB, my co-founder, gained access to an account with keyword admin privileges. What this meant is that he could direct any keyword to any destination. He chose to redirect keyword ""Welcome"", which every AOL member is sent to when they sign on, to our website, aol-files.com. For a period of about half an hour, every single person who signed onto AOL was redirected to our AOL hacking website. We received over 100K hits in 30 minutes.<p>I've got an archive of AOL-Files up on my blog [1], which has lots more information about this hack and many others.

There are many of us here that will help you in some capacity to get to where you want to be. But your current list is way too big for a dedicated mentor to help you with and from the sounds of it it sounds too big for yourself to take on at the moment.<p>I know you want to catch up with all the stuff youve missed working in a dead-end job, but you should treat this as a marathon and not a race. Leave an email in your profile and focus on a few practices and technologies that the people that contact you can help you with and that align with where you are heading. Pick stuff that naturally bleed together, ie: Rails and TDD<p>Are you still in your current Java-based job? Ask your manager if there are any projects you can join where they are testing the stuff you are interested ineven widget companies and megacorps have projects like these. Also ask your co-workers about what they hack on outside of work, you might find your mentor this way. Even though you dislike your job Im suggesting you look towards it to help you on your journey, because if theyre supportive enough youll be able to turn a situation you hate in your favour and boost your happiness a bit.<p>If my advice about looking towards your current job doesnt work out, you may have to just take a break from everything for a while, like others here have said. Then come back and take on your problems with renewed energy.<p>Again, leave an email in your profile for others to contact you.

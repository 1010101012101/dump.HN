10795289,comment,10794210,10795208,0,0,manigandham,,,"> why is SpaceX so much better at rocketry than everyone else?<p>Because Spacex doesn&#x27;t have to deal with these things. In fact they benefit from the Nasa funding right now as a major source of revenue. They wouldn&#x27;t have survived if they were just self-funded. Also they can get talent from NASA and other organizations that have already done a lot of groundbreaking work with pioneers in the field.<p>Just to be clear, Spacex has focused on reducing the launch costs but they haven&#x27;t yet and they still have a long way to go to actually delivering people and heavier loads in a repeatable process. They&#x27;ve also taken about 15 years to get to the last launch so none of this was quick.",1451163579

Take cellular automata, or your very own example, the human brain.<p>As to the free will, it makes total sense as a concept when you consider it versus other intelligent actors, and indeed this is the only useful operational perspective unless you are a theist. E.g. my actions do not depend on your agenda very much, other than we have some synchronized exchange of comments here. Denying it exists is a popular but fruitless philosophic cop-out, akin to using Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes to challenge general relativity.<p>I however used &#x27;agency&#x27; to emphasize functional aspects of the behaviour. The emergent behaviour that might or might be not aligned with behaviour you try constrain it.<p>> A program, on the other hand, can be written with a very simple and straightforward goal system: maximize advertising revenue; maximize account value; maximize paperclip production.<p>Well no, it can&#x27;t. None of the programs currently doing anything like that are simple, straightforward or put it bluntly, very good at that. All such systems today are able to operate in very narrow interval of a few controlled variables. And it&#x27;s not for lack of trying.<p>Your quick paced but narrow minded paper clip factory would have as much chance of wiping off life on Earth as a chess computer on bringing down the electric grid.",1451163497

See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwinger_limit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwinger_limit</a>:<p>&quot;Photon–photon scattering and other effects of nonlinear optics in vacuum is an active area of experimental research, with current or planned technology beginning to approach the Schwinger limit.[5] It has already been observed through inelastic channels in SLAC Experiment 144.[6][7] However, the direct effects in elastic scattering have not been observed. As of 2012, the best constraint on the elastic photon–photon scattering cross section belongs to PVLAS, which reports an upper limit far above the level predicted by the Standard Model.[8] Proposals have been made to measure elastic light-by-light scattering using the strong electromagnetic fields of the hadrons collided at the LHC.[9] Observation of a cross section larger than that predicted by the Standard Model could signify new physics such as axions, the search of which is the primary goal of PVLAS and several similar experiments. Even the planned, funded ELI–Ultra High Field Facility, which will study light at the intensity frontier, is likely to remain well below the Schwinger limit[10] although it may still be possible to observe some nonlinear optical effects.[11] Such an experiment, in which ultra-intense light causes pair production, has been described in the popular media as creating a &quot;hernia&quot; in spacetime.[12]&quot;",1451163354

The targets are often not combatants; in fact, many of the targets have no known identity at all. If anybody strains to minimize civilian casualties, they&#x27;re doing a piss-poor job of it. In fact, often it looks as if non-combatants and civilian structures were deliberately targeted.<p>But you are of course right. As long as you a priori define allied action as legitimate military strikes, and enemy action as illegal terror attacks, you will always be right. And that is the very point of the article.<p>Let&#x27;s agree to disagree on that one. Because the discussion we should be having is, what objectives is the &quot;War on Terror&quot;, (or, as I like to call it, because terrorism is just a method of warfare, <i>War on War</i>) trying to achieve, and are they worth the price?",1451163135

I&#x27;ll be  honest with you, if you can&#x27;t change the way you feel when going to work, find another job.<p>If I was you, I would quit my job, and after I found another one call my gf, tell her that I realize I screwed it, that I am very sorry and that I learned from my mistakes. By doing so, you have proofs that you are serious about it and she will likely come back.<p>Edit : But ultimately you need to understand the benefits of changing your work environment so that even if she doesn&#x27;t come back you will have no regret. Keep your life  above your work, consider your best interest first.",1451162624

Isn’t it meaningful to compare the number of X and Y citizens killed by each other, regardless of how it is carried out?<p>If X says “We’re careful to minimize killing Y’s civilians,” shouldn’t we judge X by how successful it is in minimizing those casualties? Or should we say, “Oh, well, X is trying their best, so no need to keep count or compare the counts.”<p>Quite obviously “terror” attacks and “military” attacks are different things. But it’s perfectly legitimate to compare them by the number of civilians killed. It shouldn’t be the only way in which we compare them. But it’s still informative to compare them.",1451162616

Having a person who can&#x27;t code in charge of coding is a bad idea, and it can only get worse with the deadline looming.

Because if you&#x27;re doing a non-coding project, you can often just chop the scope and still have something.)

How are they going to deliver anything with you and an intern? The least fair thing that can happen is you and the intern produce a sub-par product, and you then get the blame.

Otherwise no CEO would ever be able to do their job. Ultimately, whatever happens is the responsibility of the CEO and the board is a source of advise and makes sure the CEO does a good job. If the board is backed by the shareholders they can fire the CEO, but if the shareholders (and in this case that meant the original founders) don&#x27;t agree by simple majority to get rid of a CEO then he/she can continue to do their job. Whether you still want to is another issue entirely.<p>Anybody in a CEO position would do well to make sure they understand their rights, obligations and their relationships with the various other entities they are dealing with. If you don&#x27;t understand those then it is a recipe for frustration and potentially disaster.<p>This is the reason why you&#x27;ll see board members leak to the press (see for instance Yahoo! recently). They can&#x27;t win the argument in the boardroom and they can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t fire the CEO (maybe because they only have a minority share and the rest of the board and/or shareholders do not see their way).<p>This is also why founder disputes are extremely risky for a company. Founders typically hold large blocks of shares and if some those suddenly align with of non-founders then it can really break your stride or cause serious trouble.<p>Say a company has two founder that still hold 60% of the shares, 5% is in an option pool and 35% is held by an outside investor. If the founders no longer see eye-to-eye the board suddenly holds the tie breaking vote and this could lead to the departure of either one of the founders depending on with who the board sides. In such a case I hope your shares are vested if you&#x27;re the founder that is forced to leave (and if not I hope you have a vesting acceleration clause in your contract).",1451162189

I&#x27;d love to have something better than our home-baked solution, but I&#x27;m yet to find anything which doesn&#x27;t introduce other flaws, such as an incomplete implementation (missing parameters or resource types) or ultimately making a leaky abstraction on top of CloudFormation somehow.<p>I ended up brewing a reasonably straightforward solution using Python as a (minimal) DSL which emits JSON. Its primary purpose is to support <i>the whole</i> of the CFN ecosystem (not just implement some small part of EC2, for instance) while also not trying to be too clever.<p>It has about 50-100 lines of python which implements helper functions such as ref(), join() and load_user_data(), and not many other things. There is an almost 1-to-1 correspondence between the generated CFN configuration and the python source. As a bonus it checks for a few common mistakes like broken refs or parameters which aren&#x27;t used.<p>I have heard that similar solutions have been reinvented in a few places, including the BBC.

There was a small update to the standard released in 2010 and the plan later on was to update the standard either yearly or on a rolling basis, but activity ended up dying down. The Haskell&#x27; committee[1] is in charge of updating the standard and has been rekindled recently, so we might see more updates to the core language standard in coming years.<p>Most of the commonly used extensions are in this vein, similar to Python&#x27;s &quot;import from future&quot;.<p>While some extensions will get folded into the language, others never will. For a few extensions, it&#x27;s useful to have an explicit flag telling the compiler that <i>yes</i>, you actually want to do it: some things (like UndecideableInstances and OverloadedInstances) are sometimes useful and sometimes mistakes, so getting people to opt-in explicitly is useful. A few other extensions are too complex and GHC-specific (TemplateHaskell) or usually not used but kept around for backwards compatibility (Rank2Types, ImplicitParameters).<p>At the same time, I think it&#x27;s also not as big an issue as people seem to think. For better or for worse, Haskell <i>in practice</i> is currently defined by GHC rather than a formal standard—not too different from other non-standardized languages. From this point of view, language extensions are part of the language proper, just hidden behind a flag. This is useful since <i>de facto</i> Haskell is a living, fast-changing language, so some way of managing the changes in your own code makes it much easier to keep up. I think of extensions as more like libraries that just happen to need access to the compiler than language extensions <i>per se</i>.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://prime.haskell.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://prime.haskell.org/</a>",1451160710

Finding out what makes a successful culture doesn’t seem trivial, much less easily repeatable.  Different cultures can succeed in different circumstances and many different types of cultures can succeed.  I also believe cultures evolve more than they are created.  To me your argument sounds like saying “to succeed in starting a business you need to figure out what it takes to make a successful business and become a person who thrives doing that.”   Working at Google is no more likely to teach you how to start a business than to create a culture.  Sure you can learn things that worked there, but only some will work for you and some will likely work against you.  The best I’d say you can do is recognize culture is important, try to learn what decisions leadership can make that affect culture, and understand how those decisions impact the business both short and long term.

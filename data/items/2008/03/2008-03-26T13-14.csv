146874,comment,145655,146131,0,0,iamwil,,,"Yeah, they simply mean pixels.  I failed to mention that in my previous post.  It seems odd to me that it works because doesn't representing it as a linear combo of pixels mean they throw out structural information of the image?<p>I don't know how they came to make that assumptions, but could it be that the linear independence comes about because of the high dimensionality?  The higher the dimensions, the harder it is to find a combination of sparse representations (linear comb) that gives you the sparse representation matching the test image.  And if you do, and it all comes from the same person, then they say it matches.<p>There must be some shape or property of the face subspace that allows for this, since potentially, you can match a duck to someone's face.",1206539796

146870,comment,145952,145952,0,0,waldrews,,,"I went with Django because I could read its codebase, but found the Rails codebase too cryptic.  Rails magic, epitomized by the pluralization rules, was also a turnoff - the prospect of debugging in that world seemed scary.<p>The case for Django is the clean, modular architecture, making it possible to split a project into reusable applications.  With Rails DHH took a strong anti-component stance, deciding that it was better to make everything easy to reimplement.  As a result, even common things like the registration gem have too many integration points.  This decision will matter in the long run.<p>Django has access to all the mature Python libraries, but its ORM is limited.  Pythonic model specification and automatic model validation against the SQL metadata is great for the DRY philosophy; but there is no migration metaphor (yet), there's no table inheritance metaphor (yet), and even pessimistic locking requires a hack (so far).  The best hope is an effort under way to make the Django ORM a wrapper for the infinitely more powerful SqlAlchemy, which some people use on top of Django anyway, foregoing its data-related tools including Admin.<p>And of course Rails is integrated with every concievable Ajax technology, allowing a hundred ways to implement the <blink> tag.<p>The Rails community is growing from an influx of ex-PHP scripters, bringing with them less disciplined coding styles, which the more Perl-like overly-concise features of Ruby encourage.  The RoR environment is going to be the new Perl - a powerful tool for certain applications, applied far more broadly than intended, with a CPAN full of one-off solutions for every concievable problem, but no culture of solidly engineered modules.",1206539579

It has continued to be excellent after, but the signal to noise ratio has worsened somewhat. I'm not a long-timer, but I have very much enjoyed this site and, for once, would be quite happy if the community didn't grow wildly.<p>I think that publicity has worked out okay, though, probably just showing the resiliency of the community.<p>I imagine ""Hacker News"" as a shy, but talented hacker. It can live with a few minutes in the spotlight, shaking hands, and taking awards, but it's going to do its best work when it can quietly focus and get the work done with its team. The more time spent in front of the press, the less time it has to improve the world behind the scenes. It understands how the fanfare is important at times, but certainly doesn't seek it when there's clever coding to be done.<p>Just out of curiosity: Why did you post about it? Was it to grow the site? To help your readers find a good source? Or did you want other founders to know about it to grow the number of startups that hang out here?",1206538687

</code></pre>
would return<p><pre><code>  (a b)

And, in fact, it does.  This led me to think that<p><pre><code>  (union '(a a) '(b))
</code></pre>
would also return<p><pre><code>  (A B)
</code></pre>
However, it returns:<p><pre><code>  (A A B)
</code></pre>
Why does the fact that there is one less 'a in the second argument in the second call mean that there is one more 'a in the result?  This is definitely not set-theoretic union.  Why is the behavior of Lisp union defined this way?<p>Here is the sequence of calls again:<p><pre><code>  [1]> (union '(a a) '(a b))
  (A B)
  [2]> (union '(a a) '(b))

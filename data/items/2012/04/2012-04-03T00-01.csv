3790957,comment,3787631,3788534,1,0,mascarenhas,,,"OS/2 was actually quite good on underpowered hardware if you stuck to console apps running fullscreen. I started with OS/2 2.1 on a 40Mhz 386 with just 8Mb RAM, connecting to BBSes and reading FidoNet with a newsreader called Blue Wave and programming with the Boxer editor. OS/2 Warp was the first shrinkwrapped software I bought, still on floppy disks; I was quite proud of that as a 14 year old, as piracy was rampant in Brazil at the time.<p>I remember OS/2 was quite popular with both BBS operators and BBS users around here, as it was the easiest way to multitask on a PC in the early 90s. It had a quite vibrant shareware/freeware scene. You did have to be picky about hardware, though, but even here it was easy to find video cards, sound cards and modems that ran just fine.",1333414600

I always enjoy hearing about what goes on inside bigger tech companies, given that I've never worked at anything other than small startups.<p>I must ask: You're a motivated and (probably) skilled developer. Why keep working at big bureaucratic businesses? It sounds really frustrating, and there's never been an easier time to set out on your own.<p>Btw, the high-quality games strategy would have been interesting. I think it's impossible to say that any particular strategy will allow Google to beat Facebook. But I do agree that would have been much more interesting than what they're doing now. Better to attack a niche and grow from there than to go for everyone and remain stagnant. My G+ network is a ghost town, and has been since about a week after they opened it up. What's weird about it is that Google doesn't seem to be doing anything to change that. From my limited perspective, they only seem to care about achieving feature parity with FB.",1333414575

Birthing a child obviously takes much more effort and time from the mother than the father.  We have societally chosen to make up for that a little bit by giving the mother a legally protected break from job demands.<p>2) It should come out in the wash on the back end.  When it's time for reviews and raises, the new mother has three or six months less of productivity and accomplishments, so it's natural and not discriminatory for her to receive less reward here.<p>3) Maybe it IS unfair and that's why companies would seek to avoid hiring likely-to-become-pregnant women if they were not legally barred from doing so.<p>The truth is probably somewhere in the middle of all these, in different situations.  Some women can bear a child and not miss a beat in productivity at a job.  Some perhaps do use maternity leave as an excuse for a vacation.",1333414299

In some areas, like graphics and control theory, convex optimization is the norm. In others, like parts of AI, randomized optimization is a lot more common. Traditionally GAs were more strongly planted in the IEEE-flavored parts of AI, sometimes called ""computational intelligence""; for example, the <i>IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation</i> has one of the higher impact factors of AI-related journals. I agree there's no great reason to treat GAs as categorically different from other randomized optimization, though; I suspect they get more press because of the biology metaphor.",1333413356

3790841,comment,3790378,3790768,52,0,michaelochurch,,,"In August, I suggested that the only way we'd see lasting success/popularity for G+ was to build a really great game brand, and that we couldn't do this if we were publishing a mix of (a) Zynga games and (b) decent but not brand-defining games like Angry Birds (non-defining because it was already popular by then). I got a few people together and we came up with a plan for saving the Games brand by courting indie developers. A plan that would have worked, and that likely would have made G+ into something. I had massive support (including about 2/3 of the G+ Games team, because who wants to support Farmville instead of doing something cool?) among the engineers and a lot of people said they'd contribute on a 20% basis (even though 20%T was clearly dying).<p>This drew a lot of attention to me. Positive attention from everyone who cared about games or the actual success of G+. Negative attention from the higher-ups because they were afraid of another RNCH.<p>Googlers don't talk about it for fear of losing their jobs, but the engineers <i>hate</i> the Real Names policy. It's probably 80 to 90 percent opposition. Here was another mini-RN (even titled ""Real Games"") that I inadvertently started in my first 3 months by pointing out that the direction we were taking with games was going to set a historical record for missed opportunities. A weird and harrowing experience. I really did not anticipate that positing a good idea and getting a lot of popular support would lead to adversity. I underestimated the degree (and I still do) to which people would entrench themselves with bad ideas.<p>I still stand by the fact that I was completely and utterly right. The only way I can see a general-purpose social network beating Facebook is by having great games, and by having a very high average quality (a ""we won't waste your time"" ideology). This requires being extremely editorial about what you accept. This is hard for Google because it made its name by being non-editorial, which is admirable and stately for web search but inappropriate for games, especially because those shitty Zynga games were (in 2011) the #1 cited cause of social network fatigue.<p>I didn't get fired, because I don't think Google knows how to fire people. (If it did, there'd be boxes at the desks of most of their executives.) I left in good standing when I realized that (a) I had years of C++ legacy maintenance ahead of me, because that's what most of the work at Google is, and (b) it would take several years before I'd actually be able to really contribute. Not being able to save the Games product was pretty discouraging.<p>This is what people keep talking about here on HN with regard to me and Google.

It made a big difference. I never got a bad reference, but I got some where there were pauses on the other end of the line that made me curious. I was naive then and hired the people anyway. In one case it was worth it, but in both cases, it became clear early on what might <i>give pause</i>. Other than that it helped because a lot of people with cheerful demeanor and astonishing resumes simply disappeared when it became clear that I really did make calls and verify every degree they listed.

3790815,comment,3789904,3790309,11,0,SeanLuke,,,"The Genetic Algorithm (""genetic algorithms"" is actually a misnomer) actually has little to do with biology except for original inspiration.  It is simply one of a number of sample-based methods for doing global stochastic optimization.<p>There's an old saying about the Genetic Algorithm: that it's the ""third best way to do anything"".  Stochastic optimization methods (or ""metaheuristics"") in general are knowledge-poor methods, essentially last-ditch techniques where you don't have any other known way to solve your problem and you don't want to jump off the cliff into random or brute-force search.  They rely on a central heuristic: that similar candidate solutions will likely have similar performance (the ""smoothness"" criterion).<p>Here's the thing.  There are a <i>huge and growing number of crunchy problems in this category</i>.  If you're trying to find a good tic-tac-toe solution, you can almost certainly do better than a stochastic optimization method (just use state-space search, say).  But if what if you're trying to find the set of behaviors for a two-thousand-agent multiagent simulation model which produces statistics most closely resembling known historical data?  Or what if you're trying to find the best parameters for optimizing an aircraft engine whose space is filled with local optima?  It's ugly problems like these, for which there is <i>no principled solution method</i>, where the Genetic Algorithm and its ilk reign supreme.  You might say that you never see problems in computer science which are ""best solved using genetic algorithms"".  My answer is: your daily problems are too simple to need them.<p>Book plug: you might enjoy my free online text on the subject, called Essentials of Metaheuristics.  You can also get it in paperback.  <a href=""http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/book/metaheuristics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/book/metaheuristics/</a>",1333411905

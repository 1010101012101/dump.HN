Even if it doesn&#x27;t kill him, does anybody know what are the consequences of having suffered from ebola?<p>I don&#x27;t mean to disrespect his work, and I&#x27;m asking this without having any clue: Why is this doctor so important? If there is no cure, what was his main role? Can&#x27;t he be easily &quot;replaced&quot; by another brave person that is also willing to risk his life?<p>On another note, the article says that ebola has killed 600 people. Apparently this strand of ebola &quot;only&quot; killed 63% of the people that contract the disease. So far 964 people contracted the disease in a country of more than 6 million people.

8077746,comment,8073361,8077656,3,0,Chinjut,,,"A finite memory machine is a finite state machine. These are not Turing complete. The notion of Turing completeness becomes uninteresting if we can&#x27;t even draw this distinction.<p>&quot;dynamic memory allocation&quot; may not have been the right term to use to denote moving beyond finite state machines, for an audience which wants to consider a Turing machine as having statically allocated infinite memory. But it makes sense if you think of a Turing machine&#x27;s memory as only storing enough data for the portion of the tape which has already been accessed, and allocating new memory as new tape regions are needed.<p>It&#x27;s true that the actual machine sitting on your desk only has a fixed finite memory. In that sense, without a peripheral unbounded store, it&#x27;s not properly Turing complete.<p>It&#x27;s also true that we often find it convenient to analyze it as Turing complete anyway, but this abstraction basically goes hand-in-hand with abstracting away its memory limitations. I don&#x27;t see any point in pretending you can be Turing complete using only programs with a statically given memory bound (which amounts to a logarithmic bound on the number of states in a corresponding finite state machine); if we&#x27;re going to pretend, let&#x27;s pretend the memory is effectively infinite as well.",1406163033

Some of the freelancers could be &quot;managers&quot; of other freelancers.  That&#x27;s what today&#x27;s film director is.  He&#x27;s a freelance manager (hired by the producer) of other freelancers (actors, stuntment, etc,).  Movies used to be made almost top to bottom by &quot;employees&quot;[1] of a movie studio.  That has changed.  In today&#x27;s freelance system, they lost some efficiencies (movies cranked out quickly) but also gained some (hire desired actors directly without dealing with other studios that have them under contract to &quot;borrow&quot; them.)  Maybe the world&#x27;s internet and government reforms could evolve and remove so much transactional friction that a legitimate high-volume freelance model could beat the corporate firm (at least in some industries.)<p>>All of the items in the list are things that can be changed in a traditional organization;<p>Many of those items are accumulated side effects of human foibles.

The firms reveal themselves, say, as solid green areas with faint interior contours marking out divisions and departments. Market transactions show as red lines connecting firms, forming a network in the spaces between them. Within firms (and perhaps even between them) the approaching visitor also sees pale blue lines, the lines of authority connecting bosses with various levels of workers. As our visitor looked more carefully at the scene beneath, it might see one of the green masses divide, as a firm divested itself of one of its divisions. Or it might see one green object gobble up another. At this distance, the departing golden parachutes would probably not be visible.<p>No matter whether our visitor approached the United States or the Soviet Union, urban China or the European Community, the greater part of the space below it would be within the green areas, for almost all of the inhabitants would be employees, hence inside the firm boundaries. Organizations would be the dominant feature of the landscape. A message sent back home, describing the scene, would speak of &quot;large green areas interconnected by red lines.&quot; It would not likely speak of &quot;a network of red lines connecting green spots.</i>",1406161107

They have from the get go been a company that sells the service of selling games.<p>That&#x27;s it.  <i></i>GAMES<i></i>.  This has not changed, was anyone really shocked when they started selling indie titles?<p>Having a catalog of old games doesn&#x27;t make you a company with a &quot;backlog&quot;, it makes you a company that sells a product that happens to be old games.<p>Because under your criteria, Vavle is a backlog company because it puts old games up on steam.<p>These absurdities result because of the stupidity of trying to define it that way.<p>They are a company who sells a product.  That product was originally selling older games repackaged for new OS&#x27;s, and as they&#x27;ve grown they&#x27;ve started selling more lesser known games, indie games, and finally, current games.<p>Their only real hard claim is that they&#x27;re DRM free and that&#x27;s always been the case.",1406160321

I&#x27;m thinking of groups of companies like Virgin (I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s properly considered a &quot;syndicate&quot;).<p>I doubt any of the companies are formally bound to do business with any other by virtue of being in the Virgin group, but it would make sense that the companies enjoy some kind of (if only informal) &quot;preferred vendor&quot; relation with each other.<p>There&#x27;s no need to describe it in theory as anything else than a number of independent companies, only with common ownership and perhaps a slightly above average interconnectedness.",1406160159

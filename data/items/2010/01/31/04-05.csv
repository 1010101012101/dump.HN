1090027,comment,1089919,1089919,0,0,jsz0,,,"In the midst of the iPad Flash controversy I think people are overlooking that Adobe has failed to deliver a major mobile Flash upgrade since early 2007. They missed their promise to deliver a beta for the Android and WebOS platforms in 2009. Android support is now projected for mid-2010. Since 2007 Apple has released 3 major versions of their iPhone OS, Google has announced, developed, and released a SmartPhone OS with 2 major revisions. Apple developed, announced, and will release the iPad before Adobe ships a modern mobile Flash for a large variety of devices. Linux & OSX support for Flash on the desktop is still subpar. If you think Flash is good or bad there are serious questions here about Adobe's ability to simply support this platform that is so widely relied on by developers.",1264913815

1090022,comment,1089800,1089954,0,0,jrockway,,,"It's the wrong distinction to make.  PHP is slow because the runtime is slow, not because it's a ""scripting language"".<p>SBCL and V8 and TraceMonkey are all very fast ""scripting languages"" because they have a good codegen in the runtime.  PHP does not do any codegen.<p>If I were explaining this to a non-technical person, I would say: <i>A computer works by executing instructions, one at a time.  When PHP is executed, it is compiled to a list of instructions, but not ones the processor can directly understand.  It uses a ""virtual machine"" to read each instruction and then execute the corresponding instructions on the real computer.  This is slow, because what could be one instruction actually becomes many, sometimes hundreds, of actual instructions.  The goal of this project is to skip the virtual machine and run our code directly on the real machine, meaning that we won't have to do as much unnecessary work.  This will make our application run faster!</i><p>Now, this still might make CS folks mad, because there is bookkeeping overhead other than deciding which instructions to run (you can't store ""scalars"" in registers, after all), and of course modern CPUs don't execute one instruction at a time.  But now we're wandering off into esoterica -- at least the basic idea is right, and I don't use meaningless expressions like ""scripting language"".",1264913581

1090012,comment,1089919,1089992,0,0,catch23,,,"No, I think the hulu developers picked flash because that's where the users are.  They could have chosen java, or silverlight, but they chose flash for the same reason most sites choose flash.  I'm sure if Hulu wanted to, they could develop a native app, just like the YouTube native app, for the iPhone, but my guess is that it wasn't part of their strategy initially.<p>If netflix wants the iPad users, they would develop their own native app and ship it just like the other dozens of apps out there.  In fact, it would give Hulu & Netflix greater control over their users with a native app.  Hulu has already developed a desktop app, why wouldn't they develop a native app for the iPhone?<p>Remember back in the IE4 & IE5 days?  Lots of companies developed native ActiveX components that could be embedded into webpages because most users used IE4.  I'm actually quite happy that Apple is forcing web companies out there to rethink open platforms.  There's quite a few demos that show how powerful javascript & canvas can be already.

1090001,comment,1089800,1089974,0,0,zmimon,,,"This is a point I always have trouble impressing on people.   They do a simple benchmarks on a tiny code base that pulls some data from the database, spits out some data, and they compare and PHP seems to be lightning fast.<p>The problem is that because it's interpreted at some point PHP slows down in proportion to the <i>size of your code base</i>.   A small app runs really fast, a big app with 100,000 lines of code will kill your server unless you modularize it really really well - which harder than it seems, because the more modularized you make it the more separate ""includes"" you end up with in different files and then you come to realize that including a lot of files itself is a problem.   And the nature of PHP's very loose coupling tends to lead to code that is nearly impossible to do large scale refactoring on once you have gone too far down the path.<p>I work on an application that has a very thin PHP layer that performs some simple web services that are the back end for a pure Java web app.  Amazingly, when we load test it, the PHP part is the bottleneck, burning CPU like crazy just parsing all our files ... over ... and over ... and over.   The java code meanwhile, while theoretically doing far more ""work"", is completely bored.   We will probably look at using an accelerator of some kind or maybe just rewriting all the PHP in another language.",1264912677

When we arrived there were just signs absolutely everywhere, in big letters at face level on all doors.

Some seemed a little unnecessarily precise, but if it had been a more crowded weekend could have been more critical. Most were intuitive. But it made me uncomfortable.

1089960,comment,1089479,1089940,0,0,chrischen,,,"Well what we're getting is developers having to make iPhone specific version of their app, and with the release of Adobe Flash CS5 that's going to become more prominent. But this still isn't HTML5, where we really want to go right? As far as Objective-c iphone specific apps, this isn't necessarily better. In fact it's probably worse because these apps are less open than flash apps. They're locked into the iPhone and you have to pay $99 to deploy them on a real one.<p>You're right, people who want flash don't want flash. They want rich applications. But Flash is the only thing that can deliver that right now on desktop (and cover a reasonable audience). HTML 5 is still catching up. On the iPhone you may not need flash, but the alternative is Apple's closed iPhone platform. I don't think that's necessarily better than another system which is already a de facto standard.",1264911252

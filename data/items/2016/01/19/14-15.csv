10931138,comment,10930215,10930215,0,0,scratchpad,,,"I really hate to see promotion of bootcamps on HN. I see them as the scourge of the tech industry. Telling people that a 6 week bootcamp is the same as a 4 year CS degree is absurd and offensive.<p>Throughout the first dot com boom, we struggled against perceptions that software development was something trivial done by teenagers in their spare time. This perception was highly dangerous, not only in terms of professional respect, salaries, and promotion opportunities, but even to businesses themselves and the law, as companies were forced to try to explain in court that achievements such as the Google search algorithm were on par with a major pharmaceutical project not a lemonaid stand.<p>Imagine a bootcamp for medicine - in 6 weeks they learn the most common procedures: how to prescribe antibiotics, how to remove an appendix, and how to set a broken arm. They&#x27;re told they can learn the rest as they go, and to go start calling themselves doctors.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t want that medical bootcamp &#x27;doctor&#x27; to treat me, and I don&#x27;t want a coding bootcamp &#x27;developer&#x27; to be responsible for handling my medical data.",1453215576

10931126,comment,10928020,10929417,0,0,m_mueller,,,"To me this model feels a bit too simplistic. If you only look at how children learn their abilities, then yes, absolutely. Where it breaks down for me is in the interaction with play partners. The joy he seems to get for playing together doesn&#x27;t seem to be fully explainable through pure evolutionary steering / fitness functions, but it&#x27;s hard to put my finger on what&#x27;s missing in the picture. An example is his joyful giggling when I&#x27;m doing something unexpected. You can see the tug of war between fearfulness and joyfulness - at the beginning when they become sensitive to playful behavior it makes them afraid, but more and more this is replaced with pure joy, also showing a trust relationship. So to me it seems the curiosity goes beyond just what the child can achieve him/herself in the near future, it&#x27;s also a curiosity and joy of observing the world, and more importantly, what the caregivers are doing. Everything new is exciting, and much of it doesn&#x27;t seem to be something that could have been selected for directly. So there seems to be some emergent behavior that comes from the <i>interaction</i> of evolved chemistry/signaling, and the actual cognitive functions.",1453215452

It died the &quot;just one more feature before we can release&quot; death, so you&#x27;ve never heard of it.

Its most impressive moment was when it made the local TV for just... being a startup, basically. (I&#x27;m in the Midwest. Startups aren&#x27;t and weren&#x27;t <i>that</i> rare, but few of them even tried to get on local TV. At least at the time it wasn&#x27;t hard to get into the human interest slot, presumably because it was a nice change of pace for the TV station.)<p>Yet the founders had a <i>collection</i> of letters from people, actual hand-written letters, asking for help with their hacked computers, asking how to hack, at least one probably-paranoid-schizophrenic one about... errr... hacking and the government and chips in brains and all that sort of thing and whether or not this company could help protect them against the hacker aliens (I don&#x27;t recall the exact details but this is not an exaggeration of the flavor, alas).<p>There&#x27;s an amazing amount of this sort of thing going on.

With larger audiences required to financially support the music, instruments went through a major shift of amplification to use more metal parts, etc.<p>I also like your idea of continuing to optimize the designs.  Some people are also trying different materials like carbon fiber!  One issue with the simulations is that people don&#x27;t comprehend the structure of wood perfectly.  It&#x27;s only recently that researchers have realized the importance to the sound of the wood being a non-continuous material and actually comprised of long, irregularly-shaped grains.  Most of the papers I&#x27;ve seen are analyzing instruments and trying to figure out what the salient features are of the design.<p>One more caveat is that it still has to be easily buildable.

My mother (b. 1941) wanted to be a doctor, and her father didn&#x27;t see the point. She ended up meeting my father in a German class and falling for him (he was the prof) and she ended up going the route of a German professor.<p>Of course we know that women are still discouraged from entering certain fields. I&#x27;m not arguing that they are not. I&#x27;m wondering if there are background signals in play here that drive women out of the fields that they <i>are</i> encouraged to get into.<p><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><p>As for bro culture, it gets chastised because it&#x27;s toxic by definition, in my experience. Bro culture--to me--is quite a lot more than what you are describing it as. I&#x27;m not meek, week, and I&#x27;m not lacking in confidence. You can be all those things and still be very far from bro.<p>It&#x27;s the stupid, terrible, provide no value, racist, sexist, bigot kind of people who walk around fist bumping and saying things like, &quot;Dude, did we totally rape that bitch into submission, or what?!&quot; when talking about &quot;solving&quot; a &quot;hard&quot; problem that are toxic.<p>It&#x27;s the kind of people who think that ping pong tables and free beer make up for an utterly shitty working environment. It&#x27;s the kind of people who are completely and totally unable to think that some people would want something other than what they want out of a job.<p>In other words, bro culture is marked by all the things you say it is &quot;chastised&quot; for, but not for those things in themselves. After all, we are all human and exhibit certain elements of all those things in ourselves. Bro culture celebrates stupidity, terrible-ness, sexism, and bigotry--and bro culture is entirely lacking empathy for anyone who is not a part of it.<p>I&#x27;m not saying anything about you or anyone you know. If the shoe doesn&#x27;t fit, don&#x27;t wear it. I&#x27;m describing the characteristics that people deride when talking about it.<p>*<p>I have no input about majority-women departments. I can certainly see how gossiping and backstabbing is toxic. I&#x27;ll leave the criticism of those things to people who are in a position to do something about it.<p>I&#x27;m a mid-30s white male technologist. I can do something about bro culture. Not so much I can do about women gossiping and backstabbing.",1453214511

That can&#x27;t be too reproducible. And how is the pipettor attached?<p>Why not use an electronic pipet that does all of that for you? I remember using a digital pipettor years ago that was already programmable for just this type of application (eppendorf maybe?).<p>That&#x27;s really the issue that needs to be front and center - how reproducible is this machine. For any lab that could use one of these, that is always the primary concern. What I&#x27;d like to see is something like a dye test where you diluted a dye into each well on a 96 well plate and then used a plate reader to determine how precise you are.<p>The second consideration is speed. How fast can this possibly be? I&#x27;ve used a liquid handling robot before that &quot;only&quot; had a 4-channel head, and it was slow enough that I eventually gave up and set the plates up by hand with an 8-channel pipet. Precision is the main concern, but speed is a close second. If you want to replace manual pipetting, you better be faster than a grad student.<p>And if a lab is able to use automation, the P1000 in the front page video is not going to be what they need. There are few applications where you&#x27;ll want to pipet 200-1000ul in an automated manner - there are many more applications for 1-10ul. So I&#x27;d like to see more information on what pipettors are supported, and how do you change them?<p>As someone below mentioned - there is just too much missing information on the page. I had to resize my browser just to see the full video, which answered a couple of questions, but not all.<p>How many labs are currently using your machine, and for how many are these just toys to play with vs production machines? Meaning - if a lab is setup to properly test the machine, they probably have a few other liquid handlers in place. How many of their protocols can they transfer to the OT-One? And would any of them choose this over a more advanced machine?",1453212766

It seems to be the case that supervised tasks (for sufficiently complicated and diverse problems e.g. ILSVRC, MSCOCO) implicitly learn some portions of what you would want from a density estimator. This is enough to generalize to new, but related tasks - see the huge body of work on pretrained VGG for {semantic segmentation, style, texture generation, depth/surface normal prediction}.<p>Learning a general density that is useful is quite difficult - you could be missing entire modes from the data distribution and never know it.

They make coworkers uncomfortable and create all sorts of weird situations that my little monkey brain can&#x27;t process. Unless you are very very strict about boundaries (ie - from 8-5 we are at work, we only work, and outside of those hours we are only in a relationship and we don&#x27;t talk about work), these relationships are a minefield.<p>Seriously, if they go bad, they go very bad. If they work, they can be great. But please be careful!<p>That aside, it depends on your relative levels and how closely you work together.<p>1. If you are a manager who is attracted to one of your reports, it is never acceptable to flirt. If you can&#x27;t resist, quit your job first.<p>2. If you are attracted to your manager, be very very careful. He or she may worry that they have harassed you and that kind of worry makes any sort of positive resolution very difficult. There&#x27;s a good chance that one of you will end up transferred to a totally unrelated team. If you like your job, it isn&#x27;t worth taking this kind of a crapshoot.<p>3. If you are at the same level, ask yourself if you are mature enough to maintain a good working relationship if he or she rejects you. Then, take some time to think over the worst case scenarios. How will you react if you two date for a year, you are madly in love and he or she breaks up with you?? Will you let that boil over into your work world?? What if there is infidelity? What will you talk about outside of work?? If you only have work in common, tread lightly - one of you will move up or out. Then what?? What happens if he or she gets promoted? Will you feel jealous or proud?? Once you have thought carefully about those things, tell him or her how you feel (preferably outside of work hours) and ask him or her out. If the date goes well and you want to go on another date, tell your manager quickly. If the date goes horribly, be cool and don&#x27;t let it change the working relationship.<p>Also, for the love of whatever you consider holy. If all goes well, don&#x27;t do any of that cute dating bullshit at work!! Don&#x27;t hold hands. Don&#x27;t call each other pet names.

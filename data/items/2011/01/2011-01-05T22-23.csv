By contrast, not as many examples of them creating it.<p>Or, to put another way, we did just fine innovating and inventing and such on our own -- in caves, on the Savannah, on trade routes, as part of tribes or guilds. Innovation and entrepreneurship is as natural a part of life as breathing. If this weren't true, we'd still be hanging around in trees waiting for the big cats to leave their prey.<p>Of course, you can argue that institutions accelerate this natural ability, but there's a lot of room for doubt over exactly what magic sauce makes people super productive. At the very least we can agree that different folks have different answers to that question. (If there were some ""proven"" answer, we'd just all copy that and the world would be full of Thomas Edisons) I understand there are a lot of works of fiction and nonfiction that claim to explain why so much innovation happened in such and such a place, but it's easy to say or write something like that. In reality, lots of really smart folks have went at this problem and haven't gotten very far in terms of reproducible results.<p>I find this line repeated over and over again -- that somehow if there is a lot of innovation in situation X that it naturally follows that we know all about X and why all this innovation happened.

To me, cloud computing means flexible use of shared general-purpose computing resources that are managed and provided as a service.  Gmail would be cloud-based if Google ran it on a bunch of Amazon EC2 instances.<p>Using ""cloud computing"" to refer to the use of server applications over the internet is just a misunderstanding of the term.

Try playing the same song slow or fast, have someone with a sense of rhythm tell you how well you're doing (or play over a song that you can control the speed of -- midi software is great for that).<p>Then there's some music theory you can look for: Pop and rock music will usually have the base of the chord (unless it's a reverse chord) on the first time, with lots of emphasis on it. The third time will have some emphasis, but not as much. Reggae music will have it in a different way, with more focus on some upbeat times.<p>You have to practice, but you must practice smart. A very good exercise I had was playing in larger ensembles playing anything from classical, blues and some jazz music. I would sit next to a very good tuba player (with something like 50 years of experience) who I could listen to when music notation got problematic. With time, your brain starts to understand things and it helps, but it takes a lot of time and effort.<p>I'll add that even your ear can develop and recognize notes with more ease. In my case it's not the absolute hearing (finding out what note some random sound is), but rather relative hearing (telling the distance between two notes). I've been able to develop this over theoretical exercises where a teacher gives you a simple song and you have to write it down. Go from simple to complex, by removing and adding notes. Study scales, chords, how they sound and what they can evoke. With enough practice/training, your brain will absorb it and won't be entirely incompetent.<p>After 1 year of casual music training, I completely froze up on stage, losing my sense of rhythm and being unable to read the sheet I had in front of me. That's when I enrolled in the big band-like ensemble I menationed earlier -- suddenly I almost doubled my practice time, played genres I didn't know very well or listen to in my free time, and one year later, I was a good second bass player. After the third year, I could play on my own with very little problems. The fourth years was spent perfecting my technique and I spent the fifth year getting to learn how to improvise. It's been about 2 years since I stopped taking classes and playing seriously, but the sense of rhythm is still there.<p>It takes a lot of effort and perseverance. Things seem to move in staircase way: you start with a wall to get over and it seems like you'll never do it. At some point it clicks and you can enjoy yourself. You're now on a plateau of comfort, until you hit the next wall, and the one after that, and so on. Some are way harder than others, but they're all normal.<p>And for the love of God, please don't compare yourself to others (you won't be able to keep yourself from doing it). I used to do it all the time. Comparing myself with players who were half my age and twice better, regretting I didn't start earlier or thinking 'what is it worth? they're still better anyway'. It's not a contest, but you have to remember that mastery comes with time and rather compare how many hours of very serious practice you've done compared to others.",1294267231

    low friction, and reasonable prices for applications, 
    I will buy them for OS X.

  o Even though there will be $10 VNC apps on the MacStore 
    I will still  pay $119 for Microsoft Office.

It might be the convenience of having the curated store track, and filter out the nefarious malware (Though, once again, google, plus only choosing the popular software out there, is a good substitute for that).  It might be the belief that I have some control over what is installed on my laptop (though, ps -ef, launchtl list, netstat -an, and find / -cmin -3 after an install usually gives me a pretty good hint)<p>All I know is that this time, next year, I expect to have purchased about $600 worth of OS X software from the Mac Store, which is about $500 more, on average, than I have in the last 10 years for OS X.<p>I may be a couple standard deviations away from the mean, but I don't think I'm three.<p>Net-Net - I believe the MacStore is going to be great for Mac Developers, and will result in significantly more income flooding into that software channel, without wiping out the higher end products.

Erlang really has no advantages there.<p>This is total nonsense. You cannot write your own supervisors in other languages. The supervision tree works because Erlang processes can monitor each other. If you fail, I get sent a message. Error handling or orthogonal to the calling function stack. This is implemented underneath Erlang inside the VM and is baked into the entire run-time environment. The following languages to my professional knowledge do not support that construct: Fortran, Algol, Pascal, C, C++, VB, VBA, Java, Python, Perl, PHP, Ruby, Lisp and Haskell.

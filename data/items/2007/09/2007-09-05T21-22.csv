50732,comment,50688,50688,0,0,nanijoe,,,"No matter which way you cut it, this price cut leaves me a little angry at Apple. A 33% price drop in 2 months definitely sends the wrong message IMHO.
I bought the iPhone on day 1, waited through all the activation horrors, and apple is essentially telling me I was foolsih to have done that.
I am not buying another Apple product for at least 1 year.",1189029060

On the surface, it looks good, but there are some architecture astronaut type people that I've seen involved and who I don't trust to ""make something I want"".   Maybe it won't be this huge thing that takes everything by storm, but will find some niches where it's really that much better than what we've got now...  What do you guys think?",1189028482

50722,comment,50710,50710,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Well, this article may very well defined the Django ORM problem, but calling it a Python ORM problem might be pushing it a little. Also, I'm not sure who declared the Django ORM the clear winner of the Python Web Frameworks.<p>Also, the next Google won't be using SQL Alchemy either. The truth is when you get that big the law of leaky abstractions comes to bite you in the ass. You can only ignore the fundamental issues that these ""frameworks"" abstract away for so long. This allows you to build prototypes and medium sized applications easily but sooner or later you need to learn the details and most likely build a custom framework around it that solves your problem. As your application becomes larger chances are YOUR problem is significantly different from the AVERAGE problem and as such you can't use average tools.",1189028196

You'll need lots of disks.<p>Then you need to index these pages--say which page has which words. This will tell you that Janet Jackson was found on the www.superbowl.com page. Usually, indexing happens locally on the disks where your crawler dumped these Web pages. Hey, why move them?""<p>It's just one possibility. An alternative (not necessarily the best one, though) could be a personal spider that starts somewhere and is intelligent enough to find what you're looking for without crawling the entire web. Or a peer-to-peer search engine, to share the infrastructure between the users. Or a search engine that only crawl in the subset of the web you're interested in (i.e. you manage a list of domains per user profile).",1189027893

50718,comment,50456,50456,0,0,cstejerean,,,"I'm surprised it took Paul this long to realize this about universities. A little less than half way through high school I realized that the entire process (get good grades to go to a good school, get good grades there so you can get a good job) is crap. I decided that it was more important to spend my time in high school learning what I cared about then to obsess over GPA.<p>I never got around to finishing my college degree, I left about 2 years into it and got a job because I ran out of things to learn in college. I've worked for a series of both small and large companies and I've found that most companies also don't care where one went to college (Google is a big exception to this). Most companies simply don't value people that are fresh out of college because colleges don't teach people the right skills.<p>It's true however that in good schools there are more smart people and you are more likely to meet interesting people, but that doesn't mean you need to go to a top school, just live close to one.",1189027640
50717,comment,50219,50666,0,0,steffon,,,"I don't think that it is entirely accurate to equate news delivery with music delivery, nor do I think the lessons from journalists are entirely relevant when it comes to building a social platform for music playlists.  Cultural objects (e.g. music,art,fashion,film,literature etc.) are substantively different than news articles.  <p>The news is largely valued for its accuracy, timeliness, and topical relevance to a reader.  Music and other cultural objects are valued for their enjoyment, which is contingent on individual personal preferences.  I'm skeptical of a platform that would use domain-specific talent to create playlists for what comes down to individual personal preference.  Domain specific talent makes much more sense regarding news where the relevance can be easily determined because it is largely topical, whereas the relevance for music is based on personal preference, which can't be determined through domain specific talent.<p>I'm also not convinced that more meta-tagging is the answer either.  If I tag a song with a mood, genre, style, etc., it will help a user find that song based on those new categories.  But in the end, finding new songs based on categories isn't that helpful because what matters is finding songs based on individual personal preferences.  For example, I might know I want an energetic, intense, electro-rock ballad, but defining that domain doesn't guarantee I will like the results.  People rarely like all the songs on an album, and as far as domains go, albums are very tightly defined domains.  Likewise, using Uber-Dj's as domains don't seem to be the best answer. After all, their playlists are based off of their preferences, and, regardless of how much they ""know"" about music, unless their preferences are like mine, their list will not help much.

Personally, I find it mind boggling that people can be looking at these ugly and disorganized pages, but there is no mistaking it: MySpace users are very active. </i><p>The mistake is assuming that people spend a lot of time admiring the pages.  The homepages are absorbed quickly, at which point pople move on to listening to music, looking at pictures, commenting/messaging, or looking for more people.  You can waste hours browsing through profiles, it's a lot like wikipedia clicking.  It's also a lot like people-watching on a busy street.<p>I log into facebook if I get a message from someone, or meet someone new irl and want to add them.

If the best students organized online and randomly picked some backwoods institution and applied there, it would instantly become <i>the</i> place to be.  Meanwhile the previous top schools would be left with the second-stringers.<p>It bears repeating: out of the top 10 richest ""U.S. Americans"", 4 inherited it; of the six who didn't, one has a degree (Warren Buffett), and 5 are drop-outs: Bill Gates, Sheldon Adelson, Larry Ellison, Paul Allen, and Michael Dell.  Woz dropped out to start Apple (he went back to school only after he was done working there) and Jobs dropped out of Reed College here in Portland.  (We're all very proud of him.)

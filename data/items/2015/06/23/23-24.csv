9768641,comment,9764498,9767838,0,0,gluggymug,,,"29 is a good age to be thinking about this.<p>I have an alternate philosophy that doesn&#x27;t make you quit your job to find yourself. See if it resonates with you.<p>You can&#x27;t be too emotionally attached to your job. Jobs have value but they come and go. You change jobs throughout life. Some jobs that used to pay really well are now becoming extinct etc.<p>Eventually you retire. My dad has been retired for ~15 years. My mum has been retired for ~10 years. (He lectured in music and she taught primary school.) Even if your job is awesome, you can&#x27;t do it forever. Circumstance forces you out. Life moves on. I&#x27;ve been kinda retired for 1 year.<p>Most people have different jobs throughout their working life. I&#x27;ve been through a few as have my parents. The grass always looks greener from the other side.<p>You chase each dream and when/if you get it, you realize you probably had some unrealistic expectations of how great it should have been. Even the jobs that seemed super important at the time turn out to be not that mind blowingly significant over time.<p>In whatever work you do, you have to detach yourself a bit from the triumphs and tragedies. If it all goes bad, you don&#x27;t take it personally. If things go really well, you don&#x27;t get a swelled head about it. That&#x27;s the nature of true professionalism.<p>Maybe if you cure cancer or something, you can take the time to do a quiet double fist pump. But then you move on! :)<p>Essentially, you should perform your work like a machine. Or like breathing. There&#x27;s no emotions necessary, good or bad. You act how you believe another professional should act without bringing your personality into it. In engineering jobs, people want you to be the engineer. They don&#x27;t need the other parts of you. Outside of work you can be yourself.<p>In Australia, we tend to say, &quot;Work to live&quot; rather than &quot;Live to work&quot;. It means do your work then enjoy living.",1435103853

9768629,comment,9764498,9764498,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Nicely written[1] and not as hyperbolic as others but to buy in you have to get past this:<p><i>The job market defied doomsayers in those earlier times, and according to the most frequently reported jobs numbers, it has so far done the same in our own time. Unemployment is currently just over 5 percent, and 2014 was this century’s best year for job growth. One could be forgiven for saying that recent predictions about technological job displacement are merely forming the latest chapter in a long story called The Boys Who Cried Robot—one in which the robot, unlike the wolf, never arrives in the end.</i><p>This paragraph does an interesting double switch and it is that switch that is important. It is demonstrably true that throughout history, displaced workers have cried the warning to other that soon, their jobs would be on the block and what would they do then? And through out history that doesn&#x27;t happen. To understand why that doesn&#x27;t happen you have to understand the causal relationship between work and spending.<p>People spend money, how they get that money to spend, whether it is waiting tables at a restaurant or Daddy&#x27;s trust fund doesn&#x27;t really matter, it gets spent for &quot;goods and services&quot; (which we&#x27;ll just call goods). And other people figure out ways to provide desirable goods in order to attract someone to give them money in exchange for that. But no where in that transaction is there a specific &quot;job&quot; there is only money and goods.<p>Take for example blacksmiths and auto mechanics. In the 1850&#x27;s there were lots of blacksmiths and perhaps a handful of auto mechanics. In the 1950&#x27;s there were lots of auto mechanics and a handful of blacksmiths. So what happened? People started driving cars, stopped riding horses, they spent money to get goods and services for cars, stopped spending money to get goods and services related to horses or wagons.<p>Conceptually, people spent part of their money on transporting themselves and their stuff around. Other people provided goods and services around transportation technology in support of those people. As the technology for transportation evolved, people who provided goods for the previous technology found fewer and fewer customers, people who provided goods for the new technology found more and more customers. Net of everything else, same &quot;number&quot; of employed people, but the way in which they were employed changed.<p>They important bit is that not spending, that kills jobs for everyone, changing technology just moves around who can find employment and who can&#x27;t but the number of jobs stays about the same.<p>The third vector is productivity, which is to say when it took 10 people to do X units of work toward producing a good or service, and now it only takes 1 person, that is a productivity gain. You can pay that one person[2] twice as much as any of the other 10 people and come out ahead. So more productive implementations win over less productive ones. But even with productivity gains, when you&#x27;re now spending perhaps 20% for the same goods, you now have the 80% you are <i>not</i> spending on those goods available for still other goods and services. So 9 &quot;jobs&quot; get eliminated in one market and 9 more different jobs get created to supply the other stuff the now freed up money can be applied toward.<p>The key here is eliminating certain jobs does not lead to unemployment in the large, but eliminating spending does. You lose jobs in a recession because people spend less, you gain them back more slowly if technology change has created dislocations (like it did in the Steel Mills.) But if a robot takes away your current job, it doesn&#x27;t mean there doesn&#x27;t exist another job you could do.<p>So economics aside, there are very real social justice issues around retraining and making available resources when conditions cause problems, but the luddite view that there won&#x27;t be any way to earn a living, or that we won&#x27;t want to or have to, is not well supported by the evidence.<p>[1] Not something I often say of stories in the Atlantic<p>[2] Remember, it is money seeking goods not &quot;jobs&quot;",1435103733

As Milton Friedman said, &quot;It&#x27;s just obvious you can&#x27;t have free immigration and a welfare state&quot;.<p>I feel immigration to the US is too restrictive as it is, let alone what it would become if it meant giving everyone a paycheck. You basically have these options:<p>1. Restrict immigration (perhaps you are OK with this, I am not. I feel immigration is one of the fundamental things that helped this country succeed, and that we should be moving to make it MORE open, not less).<p>2. Allow immigration but not offer basic income until you are a citizen. Now you have a classist system. If you were born in the US you are part of the citizen caste, that is guaranteed income from taxes (a nobility if you will), if you were born outside the borders you must work for your income here. Sure, eventually you could be &quot;admitted&quot;, but it seems weird that an 18 year old would be allowed to do whatever he wants but someone just entering the country with three kids would be forced to work.<p>3. Offer basic income to everyone that comes in, have no restriction, and default immediately.<p>If you think Americans are xenophobic now, just wait to see their attitudes if basic income ever passes.",1435103703

9768605,comment,9766816,9766816,0,0,seajosh,,,"I personally hate the &quot;take home test&quot; approach to interviewing. I&#x27;ve had multiple such tests that take anywhere from 10-25 hours to complete because simply answering the question isn&#x27;t enough; you need to give textbook correct answers and your code must be formatted perfectly with the requisite comments and documentation. In short, it&#x27;s pretty similar to an upper-level college course&#x27;s final exam; however, in college, you can get a good grade with a few mistakes; in interviewing, you get rejected for a few mistakes. I&#x27;m done giving a company 15 hours of my time just to get to a first interview; this is arrogant, condescending, and completely devalues my time.<p>The reality of hiring is you&#x27;re going to make mistakes, like every other part of running a business. Even in an extended &quot;interview&quot; such as dating for a potential life partner, people make mistakes so I&#x27;m not sure how the hiring process can be quantified to remove said error. The interview process is so excruciating these days I often hate the companies I&#x27;m talking with.<p>While we&#x27;re at it, the skills requirements listed with jobs today are astounding. My experience is that a company wants to hire a programmer with at least a journeymen&#x27;s level of expertise in 6-8 skills. If you have 5 and are comfortable you can learn the other 3, you&#x27;re dead in the water. Let&#x27;s be honest, the latest Javascript framework isn&#x27;t that complicated. The latest NoSQL database isn&#x27;t that hard to learn.<p>The truly hard parts of joining a new company are learning how projects are managed, getting the political lay of the land, finding a sherpa to answer your questions in the first couple of weeks, and learning where you fit within the organization.",1435103442

9768596,comment,9764564,9767968,0,0,mikekchar,,,"> Here in Canada we have a much more open immigration policy<p>&quot;Much more open&quot; is a relative term, I suppose.  I am a Canadian citizen, born in Canada with all my family (save my wife) living in Canada.  I live in Japan with my wife who is Japanese.  A few years ago my wife wanted to move to an English speaking country so that she could improve her English and live abroad.<p>I&#x27;ll just be plain.  It was easier for me to get a visa for myself and my wife to work in the UK than it was to get a visa for my wife in Canada.  Had we decided to go to Canada, she would have had to come on a tourist visa.  She would have no health care coverage, nor ability to work.  After 6 months she would have to apply for an extension to her tourist visa on humanitarian grounds.  Her application would be reviewed by a single border guard and could be denied for any or no reason.  There is no right of appeal.  If her application is denied, she would be barred from entering Canada again thereafter.  If she is granted the extension, then she gets another 6 months.  After the 6 months are up, she gets to apply for <i>another</i> extension on humanitarian grounds with the same restrictions.  After a total of 18 months (and after paying $1500 for the application plus submitting all of our emails together for the last 3 years plus pictures of us together for the last 3 years), she <i>might</i> be granted permanent residence status.<p>That&#x27;s for my <i>wife</i>!<p>In constrast Japan gave me a 3 year working visa after seeing the paperwork showing that we were married.  The application was free and took 1 week to process.  I can renew after 3 years.  The last time I renewed my visa in Japan (before I was married) they just wanted to know if I was still working and after that gave me a renewal (the entire process took 1 hour and cost the equivalent of $60).  After 5 years in the country I can apply for permanent residence status (which is similarly rubber-stampy).  In the meantime I get national health care insurance and even a pension. (Note: citizenship is generally difficult to get in Japan, though.  You must live in Japan for at least 10 years and you must show that you have integrated with the community).<p>Having said all that, being an immigrant myself I feel that immigration is a privilage not a right.  If a country doesn&#x27;t want immigrants, then that&#x27;s their business.  If you come on a student visa, or on a work visa that is intended to fill gaps in the local economy, then you are expected to return to your home country some day.  That&#x27;s just the way it is.<p>I feel for the guy because I would be devastated if Japan decided not to renew my visa for some reason.  I love living here.  I hope they invite me to stay permanently, but I still think that it&#x27;s Japan&#x27;s right to decide what they want to do.",1435103353

You have to connect to LinkedIn just so the site can get your real name.\n2. The people you invite you are stuck with forever. This means you can&#x27;t just toss around your invites without any thought, but instead have to consider if the person you are going to invite will actively do a good job contributing to your stream.<p>These guidelines make it so the site isn&#x27;t for everybody, but then again I&#x27;m not trying to create a place for everybody.",1435103332

SnApp also builds mobile apps for other business types.<p>SnApp Real Estate is revolutionizing the industry, from agents, brokers, and schools, to the homebuyer&#x27;s property search experience. SnApp focuses on building apps for real estate professionals that enable them to have their very own branded native mobile application, available in the App Store. These personalized apps help homes get purchased faster and easier, by bringing the agent and homebuyer closer together, with more interactive tools. \nSnApp allows real estate professionals to take control of their own brand, ensuring there is never a break in connection between agent/broker and their buyer. This is a major problem that many agents experience with the larger 3rd party sites. These personalized real estate mobile apps bring technology closer to the agent, and helps them to stay afloat and compete, in today’s technology-driven world.<p>SnApp’s new and completely unique platform is changing the way agents do business. The rate structure for agents and brokers is a low sign on fee and continual monthly fee, which covers app-updates (on new operating systems and devices), augmentation of the layout and content, and other basic changes.<p>SnApp also works with vendors in the industry. They have recently published an app for Key Realty School (keyrealtyschool.com) to assist with marketing and recruitment. The Key School App will act as a first step in better integrating the students as well as generating new prospects for the school. This will also give SnApp a chance to further showcase the app platform’s capability. Additionally, SnApp will make its mobile apps available to the real estate agents that are being trained through their program.",1435103120

That&#x27;s okay, we just need to align incentives so that our sales team closes customers where the product can provide a Fuck Yes Experience.<p>In terms of general employee salary correlating to happiness, coincidentally I studied the philosophy and psychology of happiness so I&#x27;d be happy to shed more light here.<p>I think you&#x27;re referencing the study by Daniel Kahneman.<p>Roughly $75k is the point at which additional income has severe diminishing returns, but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily peak (you just see a tiny effect.)<p>That number is not as specific as it sounds. $75k was about what it takes to not have to worry about money. You can&#x27;t drink champagne at every meal, but you have enough to live comfortably and sprinkle unnecessary purchases, travel, and vacation without additional stress.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t control for cost of living. $75k in San Francisco isn&#x27;t worth the same, in terms of quality of life, as $75 in Lafayette Louisiana.<p>Furthermore, within a given company, the absolute dollar amount matters far less than the comparative dollar amount. This[1] study demonstrates that people would rather be paid less money overall as long as they make more than their coworkers at a similar level. To combat this and to avoid horizontal discrimination, everyone at Seneca Systems who does the same job gets paid the same amount.[2]<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.econ.ucsb.edu/~charness/tenure_papers/happiness.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econ.ucsb.edu/~charness/tenure_papers/happiness.p...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/SenecaSystems/employee_handbook/blob/master/compensation/salary.markdown"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/SenecaSystems/employee_handbook/blob/mast...</a>",1435101440

We didn&#x27;t consider using GPUs yet as the queries we are running for the specific usecase we are currently working on (web/ecommerce analytics) are all IO bound [so the first step if we wanted to speed stuff up would be moving the data onto ssds or into memory as we are currently storing everything on disk. however this hasn&#x27;t been necessary so far].  Our product allows you to run interactive queries  (segment/aggregate/etc) against a billion record dataset (in the terrabytes; basically a giant logfile that stores an entry for every interaction we observe on the website/app with lots of metadata) with O(seconds) latency.<p>We wrote our own code that does &quot;the heavy lifting&quot; but it&#x27;s pretty much the same that everbody seems to be doing right now and comes down to minimizing the # of bytes read at query time; we index all data into a columnar format (so we only need to load a subset of the data and can pack it tightly for most queries) and then slice the query up into lots of individual shards that we compute in parallel (again, being bound mainly by the 200megs/sec disk read we get out of each machine).<p>Without being completely serious now but regarding your question; &quot;a simple WHERE&quot; (scanning each row and applying a predicate fn with no shared state/shuffle/merge phase) is pretty straightforward to run on a huge dataset as you can split the execution up into as many pieces as you want and run them individually. Since this allows you to basically choose the problem size per shard you could scan those 750m rows on a ginormous cluster of tamagochis if you can fit a single row onto one ;)<p>If you or somebody else would like to talk more, please shoot me an email: paul@deepcortex.io",1435101394

We had about a dozen eyewitnesses that claimed that happened. When the forensic evidence came into play, Mike Brown was not shot in the back, didn&#x27;t have his hands in the air, was running towards the police officer and the killing shot was on top of his head so he hung his head down as he ran. Faced with this scientific evidence those eyewitnesses had to recant their testimony.

Maybe they voted it down to get a better law passed later on. Maybe they didn&#x27;t like the wording that would allow loopholes and voted it down so the next time that wording could be changed.

Moreover, getc is often a macro which inlines the code of pulling a character out of the stream&#x27;s buffer and updating a pointer, triggering the refill as needed.  In my experience, using getc is usually not too terrible compared to writing buffering code to do the same thing. (I certainly wouldn&#x27;t say someone was a bad programmer or academic for writing the code around getc. On the other hand, if they assigned the return value of getc to a char typed variable, I&#x27;d have a different opinion! :)",1435100450

10599111,comment,10592701,10592701,0,0,sytelus,,,"Article doesn&#x27;t do justice to original paper. In fact I was left totally confused what it&#x27;s trying to even say. However after reading the paper, it feels very profound. Paper basically finds a subtle but important issue in Piketty&#x27;s famous argument that people with capital would grow much faster than rest of economy in current century than any other time (aka rich becomes even more richer than before). This paper says that Piketty&#x27;s argument is correct only because of one component in their capital investment: real estate. In essence, if you had invested money in anything but real estate you would have much lower eventual return over very long term with high probability. This even includes areas that is believed to be gold rush like technology. Not only nothing beats real estate but the fact <i>only</i> real estate will allow rich people to grow fastest than any other time in history!<p>The consequence of this assessment is very stark: People with money will continue to invest large chunk of their capital in real estate. The money invested in real estate is essentially &quot;dead&quot; because that money is locked up doing nothing, it doesn&#x27;t work to produce goods, innovations or make world a better place. But real estate is indeed the most rewarding thing for your investments. So the thing is that behavior of real estate is completely against at odds with advancement of humanity. Real estate is in essence like cocaine of economy and there are no DEAs.<p>If these conclusions are right then it&#x27;s huge problem. Goverments across the world should immediately take measure to discourage real estate possessions if you are not living there. Real estate should be placed in same category as food and water. We don&#x27;t let wealthy hog up all the food and water and then inflate the prices for higher return on their capital. There can be progressive tax for the real estate properties you own but don&#x27;t live at. Further, there should be national movement to aggressively create and encourage new housing . Without these measures, our economy is living on real estate cocaine with little productivity. I would wonder if our current limbo state of economy where nothing grows except real estate is precisely the manifestation of these issues.",1447984656

You have no say in the matter.<p>I don&#x27;t think what you said is 100% true either. Charles Schwab brokerage definitely asks before lending out, advertises the interest the borrower is willing to pay on the loaned shares, enrolls the willing lender into Schwab Securities Lending Fully Paid Program, and then buys an insurance policy from Lloyd to cover counter-party default. All of this is done via FedEx letters and hand-written signatures.<p>Sounds like some brokerages don&#x27;t ask and keep the fees and accrued interest to themselves, which is shady.

It would be almost exactly the same security level - identity conveniently secured by an external service.<p>I just don&#x27;t see a downside. Yes, the keypairs don&#x27;t have a human-readable name - but they don&#x27;t have to, they&#x27;re just like passwords, except for they can be globally recognized (if user wants to). Yes, for non-paranoid users&#x27; convenience we need some sort of key escrow system with some trusted party that can take hold of a file - but that&#x27;s well possible and I think every other user has some &quot;cloud storage&quot; those days.<p>> This is not a requirement of Persona.<p>Yes, you&#x27;re right. I simplified it a bit. A requirement of Persona is that IdP is a very specific service identified by a domain name, not an email. But the rest of logic should still hold.<p>> How do I as an application provider trust your assertion?<p>Generally, you don&#x27;t need to check assertions, unless you want to confirm that this specific user has some affiliation with this specific third party. Then you check a signature from that party.<p>If you don&#x27;t need an information that your user is also a specific person on, say, Facebook, or, say, a representative of some company (verified by a notary) - you don&#x27;t need to care about any assertions. You just take a key and that&#x27;s it.<p>Seriously, an average service does <i>not</i> need any identity assertions. Do you need a passport to enter a restaurant or a store? It&#x27;s the same thing here. (Ok, maybe you do if that&#x27;s a gun or liquor store, or some private lounge that needs a membership.) Oh, and, sure thing, almost every store out there would just love to ask for a passport and have a very detailed and extensive tracking of their visitors.<p>> At bare face value an &quot;identity asserted by a keypair&quot; is a fingerprint, a boring hexadecimal hash. I don&#x27;t know very many people that associate themselves as &quot;fe:02:aa:45:c3:d0&quot;.<p>Neither do I, but I don&#x27;t see why you thought about using fingerprints as identifiers for humans. Those are credentials, not identities, although they&#x27;re tied because it&#x27;s hard to separate the concepts. Users already have a lot of weird stuff but and don&#x27;t care that they&#x27;re username/pbkdf2_sha256$12000$6Q0D5rq4nz1m$xsAqY1hlIuFqY4sD+9Ia0dxNLooy+jmHFJCrBgByhHw=.

People constantly complain about how ridiculously expensive the bare minimum housing is getting in high demand areas, but endlessly complain that &quot;new luxury apartments&quot; aren&#x27;t going to solve the problem.<p>I think that this is just a bias that is blinding people to the inherent contradiction. The reason that shithole apartments become so expensive is because there are people with the money to spend who &quot;need&quot; (i.e. work in the area) that apartment. It has nothing to do with construction or maintenance costs, just demand. Even the &quot;luxury&quot; apartments have inflated prices compared to their material values.  Which means that there is a lot of room to move up.<p>Basically what I&#x27;m saying is that people need to stop complaining about the &quot;type&quot; of housing. If someone builds 50,000 cubicle apartments or 50,000 luxury flats in a high demand area, your shithole apartment&#x27;s value/rent is going to change the exact same amount.  Because there is plenty of room for the people generating the demand to &quot;afford&quot; better (in strict material/construction terms). It shouldn&#x27;t matter to anyone who isn&#x27;t already in the mid-range of units to begin with (i.e. people complaining about the rent on their 400sqft hole in the wall). The real issue is that these places are &quot;only&quot; building 50k (or whatever the number) new units, when they actually need far more.<p>Maybe building cheaper (and therefore smaller) units could make allocating the area for this number of units more palatable, but that is still a secondary problem. This just runs into the issue that as much as people bitch about &quot;luxury&quot; condos, they want crappy high density ones nearby even less.",1447982915

Bill in 1944, a lot of soldiers who returned from the war were able to claim benefits in the form of tuition assistance, low-cost mortgages and low-interest loans. Soldiers coming home from overseas had the choice of pursuing higher education, purchasing a home, or starting a business. Another result of the G.I. Bill were Levittowns, newly sprouting suburban neighborhoods offering low-cost housing to these returned soldiers ($8,000 in 1950, approximately $80,000 in 2015). With the help of the expanding auto industry and the joining of highways, people began to move out into the suburbs and build new communities.<p>The unfortunate bit is that while the G.I. Bill didn&#x27;t advocate discrimination, it was interpreted differently for people according to their race. For example; of the 67,000 mortgages insured by the G.I. Bill, fewer than 100 were taken out by non-whites.<p>Now, the heavily-inflated value (example; houses in Levittown, NY are selling for approximately $350,000) of these post-WWII homes are passed down and borrowed against or leveraged to send the grandchildren of those veterans to private schools and expensive universities, while many black families struggle financially in urban sectors.

Nowhere on the Console does it list what instance class is being used (which would have made the problem obvious) so there was really no way of knowing this without just guessing what the problem was.

It was an old billing account from before I moved to High Replication (I have no idea how I ended up with two billing accounts...it was during the dark time when the console was even worse than it is now). That billing account was assigned to no projects and had no oustanding balance. I jumped in and just deleted the unused billing account. Then a few days later they sent a scary email saying that the billing account had been terminated (even though I had deleted it) which made my scramble to make sure they didn&#x27;t close my in-use billing account out of nowhere (they hadn&#x27;t thankfully).<p>None of this has left me with any confidence in Google&#x27;s Cloud offerings.<p>I plan to migrate off GAE as soon as I can rewrite the app (luckily it&#x27;s not very big).",1447981371

Assuming that the pollution due to shipping is mostly by burning fuels, &quot;low cost of shipping&quot; actually puts an upper bound on the amount of pollution, because shipping companies can burn only so much fuel while staying profitable.<p>Once there was a popular meme saying shipping CFLs from China generates more pollution than the amount reduced by changing incandescent bulbs to CFLs.  Of course, when you consider how much coal you can burn for the shipping cost, the argument falls down quickly.",1447981216

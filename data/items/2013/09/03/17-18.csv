Recall that agency model, the publisher sets the price (the same as apps on the app store). But now that Amazon can set any price they want for ebooks (and take a loss on them if they want to, which they have done before), Amazon can do cool stuff like this.<p>Amazon has already started discounting ebooks - some of the bestsellers are now cheaper on amazon in ebook form than on iBooks. That never happened before in Agency model, where price parity was a rule.<p>There is nothing inherently wrong with Agency model pricing; indeed it has been the norm since mp3s on iTunes 10 years ago. But Amazon competes on price, and Agency was a big wrench in those plans. Now that they can do anything they want with digital pricing, they&#x27;re applying the stake in all other ebook retailers hearts.

I&#x27;d stick with the older saying <i>&quot;Show, Don&#x27;t Tell,&quot;</i> while making sure they can copy what you&#x27;ve shown.<p>I think this is a simpler rubric: There should be at least two parts to documentation, API and Introduction pages. The introduction pages start off with a &quot;First Contact&quot; page and then delve into the myriad topics of the library (with a &quot;Hairball&quot; table of contents to explore if they please). These topics that may not all be relevant to a particular user, and ought to be as independent as possible. Ideally users should not be expected to read many pages before making sense of any other page.<p>The API must contain definitions for every method and property, but should also make clear what the <i>purpose</i> of any particular class is and give a short explanation of common usage. The API should then link to the introduction so that common example code can be seen in action. Both the API and the introduction pages reference each-other constantly.<p>For example in my library the Panels API page[1] contains several paragraphs outlining the purpose and common layout options of Panels, as well as (importantly!) linking to the associated introduction pages[2], where a user can see running code examples of common Panels, with code they can directly copy/paste into their own page to achieve identical panel layouts.<p>The result should be something tightly coupled, with many links back and forth between introduction pages and the API, but the end result is not an actual wiki. I can understand the author&#x27;s hatred of wiki&#x27;s, because for most projects setting up a wiki is a lot like shifting responsibility for creating documentation to nobody. Which means it never gets done. (At for most projects I&#x27;ve seen and I think the author would agree. I&#x27;m sure there are a few great library wikis out there with nontrivial user-sourced content.)<p>[1] Panels API page: <a href=""http://gojs.net/beta/api/symbols/Panel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gojs.net/beta/api/symbols/Panel.html</a><p>[2] Panels &quot;Intro&quot; page: <a href=""http://gojs.net/beta/intro/panels.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gojs.net/beta/intro/panels.html</a><p>Compare these with, say, the Google Maps API page for &quot;Map&quot;: <a href=""https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#Map"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/...</a><p>Or worse, MVCArray: <a href=""https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#MVCArray"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/...</a><p>There&#x27;s extremely little about what it is, what is expected of it, and common uses of it.<p>~~~<p>If you write a JavaScript library, there is <i>no excuse</i> for not having live code examples and tutorials tightly coupled as part of the documentation.",1378230259

The CEO personifies the ethos of the company. If you&#x27;re Daniel Day Louis, I&#x27;m sure you can represent the values of Apple as much as Taco Bell for the short-term, but this is a lifetime role.\n2.) Management&#x27;s main duty is to create an atmosphere of reliability - not creativity, cleverness, or innovation. Those things come from after creating a stable environment for your creatives. You can argue that start-ups are inherently unstable, and that high-growth is unstable, but management is how you keep the rocket together as it goes into lift-off.\n3.) Only the creator can create the vision of the company. That&#x27;s my one acknowledgement to Steve Jobs in a career where I preferred Microsoft over Apple almost in every category.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s my sense of the world.

I am confident that anyone passing can make their own mind up about our discussion.<p>For review, here are the basic facts.<p>You have repeatedly failed to acknowledge that you can get definitive yes/no answers from questions of the type, &quot;What does this theory predict for this situation?&quot;  You have repeatedly failed to acknowledge that this type of reasoning is part of the process of doing physics.<p>You have repeatedly sidetracked to lectures on falsification where you ascribe all sorts of random beliefs to me that I do not, in fact, possess.  There is a certain irony to you lecturing on falsification and the behavior of scientists, while refusing the acknowledge that the example of Fred Hoyle never accepting the Big Bang throws a wrench in your description.  No, it is worse.  You claimed that Fred Hoyle &quot;gave way before falsifiable evidence&quot; when, in fact, few knew that evidence better than he, and he never &quot;gave way&quot;.  (Instead he continued to adhere to steady state models which had tunable parameters that could continue to explain the evidence.  A good Popperian would say that such tunable models cannot be part of science.  At which point any historian of science should give a big belly laugh because they are.)<p>Now you say that, <i>I&#x27;m accustomed to having discussions with people who can&#x27;t be bothered to examine their own ideas.</i>  Is that because they can&#x27;t be bothered to examine their own ideas, or because you fail to recognize that they have?<p>I will leave you with some interesting examples to ponder.<p>See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_anomaly"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_anomaly</a> for a well-known experiment which appeared to falsify basic theories of physics for over a decade before the source of experimental error was definitively tracked down.  When experiments can be reconciled indefinitely with theory by assuming experimental error, what experiment can conclusively falsify theory?<p>Does this actually happen?  I give you the example of Barbara McClintock.  From the 1930s until the 1970s she carried on a line of research that falsified the developing genetic theory.  As a result she was marginalized and her work generally ignored until, as a result of other developments, it became apparent in the 1970s that she was right.  Then she was awarded the Nobel in Medicine for some of her discoveries from the 1950s.  (See <a href=""http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1983/press.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/19...</a> for the press release.  The final paragraph is an acknowledgement of her situation.)<p>If scientists actually worked through falsification, then they should have been all over her reproducible experiments decades earlier.  That they didn&#x27;t, stands as falsification of the theory that scientists proceed through falsification!<p>But anyways, we&#x27;re done.  Hopefully at some point you reconsider your overly simplistic view of actual science.  But I have reached my tolerance for continuing this discussion.",1378228885

If anything that makes them less productive, no?<p>Of course it makes them less productive.  I&#x27;m not saying that these restrictions don&#x27;t make them less productive.  They massively do.  I&#x27;m saying that making themselves less productive is not their goal.  They evaluate a technology based on its moral and societal impact, not on how productive it will make them.<p>A more accessible parallel might be 18th-19th century America.  Slave labor made cotton farms overwhelmingly productive.  If a farmer decided not to use slaves, would you accuse him of not wanting to be productive?  Or is it possible that for this farmer, slavery was a non-starter on moral grounds?<p>> Isn&#x27;t that the other justification for their way of life -- don&#x27;t become too productive, it will hurt you, and ruin your way of life?<p>I&#x27;ve never seen evidence of that.  I know more about Mennonite history, but Mennonites were just fine about being some of the most productive farmers in Russia.

It could be done with a user space server.<p>> And I&#x27;d like virtual hardware to be mapped into app space to remove copy/interrupt/stack switch time from drivers (and reduce latency to zero).<p>There have been efforts to eliminate copies, and to allow direct access to network devices from userspace.<p>> I&#x27;d like the &#x27;file system&#x27; to abandon the ceremonial file tree, and expose a persistent object store. Objects could (should) be uuid-labelled at root, have no fixed location. The local file system could be thought of as a cache of resources, with the authentic directory cloud-based. Access should be through attributes and relations.<p>I&#x27;m in agreement that the filesystem tree is problematic. It&#x27;s inefficient to traverse a directory tree when it&#x27;s structured as a persistent linked list, and it&#x27;s brittle. The tree is intuitive, but you could create a tree interface even if there isn&#x27;t a literal metadata tree on disk.<p>You might be surprised by all of the zany things that have been proposed and tried in the OS community. The abstractions that have stuck around are oldies but goodies that are simple but work. A lot of things don&#x27;t need to be done at OS level, like cosmetic changes to the interface of some resource. You can usually do that in userspace. Linux is pretty remarkably flexible with filesystems, too. FUSE is about as flexible as you can get.<p>The best argument to change the kernel is when something simply can&#x27;t be done efficiently in userspace. If there&#x27;s a way to implement something useful in userspace on top of existing kernel functionality, that&#x27;s the way to go.",1378228172

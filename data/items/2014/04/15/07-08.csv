7590806,comment,7588205,7588601,1,0,grahamedgecombe,,,"It&#x27;s worth pointing out there are a few bugs in James Molloy&#x27;s tutorial [1], and some of the things he does in them aren&#x27;t exactly best practices - for example, a few I remember are:<p>- Disabling interrupts and paging (which also has the side effect of flushing the TLB) to copy memory around by physical address. This could be done without disabling them by mapping all of physical memory into virtual memory instead (possible in 64-bit mode, but in 32-bit there isn&#x27;t enough room when your PC has a similar amount of RAM to virtual memory space, in which case you could map smaller parts of it as needed).<p>- Moving the stack around to get around the fact that GRUB doesn&#x27;t set ESP to some well-defined value (instead of defining the stack yourself, which would be much more robust) and then attempting to rewrite the base pointers to fix it. For example, his code can&#x27;t tell the difference between integers that just happen to have a value in the range of the pointers and a pointer, and will happily rewrite both. Also as ESP isn&#x27;t defined by the Multiboot standard you could be using any location at all as the stack (such as some memory address that doesn&#x27;t exist, or your kernel&#x27;s code itself, or some memory-mapped area for a piece of hardware, etc.) All of which will mean things go wrong. It&#x27;s better to just set ESP yourself before you enter C - see another of my comments on this submission here [3].<p>There&#x27;s actually a newer and much better version of JamesM&#x27;s tutorials on GitHub, but I believe they aren&#x27;t quite finished [2].<p>[1]: <a href=""http://wiki.osdev.org/James_Molloy%27s_Known_Bugs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.osdev.org/James_Molloy%27s_Known_Bugs</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/jmolloy/JMTK"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jmolloy/JMTK</a>\n[3]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7590753"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7590753</a>",1397548617

7590801,comment,7588205,7588912,2,0,exDM69,,,"> Can anyone give me an idea how much different this would be for 64bit? Do I just change the nasm directive to `bits 64`?<p>A lot different. You can see the boot code of my x86_64 hobby kernel project [1].<p>The reason is that GRUB/Multiboot protocol is actually doing most of the machine initialization, but it can only set up 32 bit mode. 64 bit mode is missing partly because standardizing the Multiboot protocol is dragging behind, partly because there&#x27;s no one correct way to do this as you can&#x27;t have identity mapped memory in 64 bit mode (unlike 32 bit mode).<p>If you read the OSDev wiki, you can find examples of doing machine initialization &quot;from scratch&quot;, ie. after the PC BIOS (or UEFI). This involves arcane details about the x86 machine like setting up something called the A20 line (which was a hack that allows to have 1 megabyte of memory - utilizing a spare pin from the keyboard controller!), etc. Dealing with this shit is not time well spent. (UEFI is a lot easier in some ways, harder in others)<p>This means that the boot code of your kernel must set up long mode, create an initial page table for virtual memory, etc. Here&#x27;s my limited 64 bit boot code that sets up one 2 megabyte page [2].<p>Going to 64 bit mode is not that much more code, but it will make kernel development more painful. In particular, switching CPU modes messes up the GDB debugger which must be patched to work at all. And there&#x27;s a bit more work involved in all the little things that come with it.<p>So for educational purposes it would make more sense to stick to 32 bit mode than deal with the nitty gritty details of 64 bit long mode.<p>[1]Â <a href=""https://github.com/rikusalminen/danjeros"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rikusalminen/danjeros</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://github.com/rikusalminen/danjeros/blob/master/src/arch/x86_64/boot/start.s#L57"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rikusalminen/danjeros/blob/master/src/arc...</a>",1397548473

7590699,comment,7585186,7588448,2,0,anon4,,,"Yield and generators (i.e. save stack; return value to caller; receive value from caller) are really a language feature for writing a runtime for a different language with coroutines. Or if you&#x27;re willing to write your program in a way that looks like it was generated by a source-to-source transformation tool, you can write your coroutines on top of them. The most basic construct is something like this:<p><pre><code>  CurrentCoroutine = None\n\n\n  def run(main, arg):\n    global CurrentCoroutine\n    CurrentCoroutine = main\n    while CurrentCoroutine is not None\n      CurrentCoroutine, arg = CurrentCoroutine.send(arg)\n\n\n  def corodecorator(coro):\n    @functools.wraps(coro):\n    def init():\n      c = coro()\n      c.next()\n      return c\n    return init\n\n</code></pre>\nAnd this is pretty much it. A simple example for two coroutines that pass control to each other would be:<p><pre><code>  @corodecorator\n  def coro1():\n    # yield nothing on first call to receive args\n    arg = yield None\n    friend = arg[0]\n    while True:\n      print(&#x27;coro1&#x27;)\n      arg = yield friend, (CurrentCoroutine,)\n      friend = arg[0]\n\n\n  @corodecorator\n  def coro2():\n    arg = yield None\n    friend = arg[0]\n    while True:\n      print(&#x27;coro2&#x27;)\n      arg = yield friend, (CurrentCoroutine,)\n      friend = arg[0]\n\n\n  run(coro1(), (coro2(),))\n\n</code></pre>\nYou can do the same with javascript and events, but it requires a much higher degree of masochism.",1397546167

He argues that when there is a decline in new housing units, there is also a decline in price.&quot;</i><p>I knew this was going to happen: people have heard a trite sound-bite about &quot;counter-intuitive&quot; statistical logic so many times that they ignore that correlation is usually a pretty damned good signal for a causal relationship.<p>To wit: of <i>course</i> there&#x27;s a correlation between price and new housing units -- because <i>it is causally related</i>.  When prices go up, developers have greater incentives to build.  More importantly, in a city with as high a density as San Francisco (and yes, folks, it <i>is</i> dense -- the second-densest city in the US, in fact), with as many architectural challenges (seismic, geographic, etc.) the limiting factor for new construction is land and materials, not red tape.<p>Nobody wants to hear this, but it&#x27;s true.  The fixed costs of building here are so high that developers won&#x27;t do it unless rents go up.  That&#x27;s why new construction costs upwards of $4k for a 1-bedroom unit, and why new construction in SF doesn&#x27;t place any real downward pressure on rents -- except (perhaps) in the very long term. At best, you&#x27;re treading water. Developers don&#x27;t build into a falling market.<p>But really, the best response for the people who keep asserting that &quot;building up&quot; is the magical solution is to point to Manhattan:  it&#x27;s the densest city in America, yet it&#x27;s just as expensive as San Francisco, if not more so.<p>There are no magic bullets.

How he chooses to spend his time is no business of mine. Yet I have no reason to thank him. He has created nothing of value to me.<p>I am not attached to Lisp per se; rather, I am drawn to systems capable of total reflection and introspection. Clojure offers neither. It disgusts me because it has sold so many on the illusion that it has somehow rescued the most worthwhile innovations of the Lisp world; on the contrary, it is consigning them to oblivion ever more thoroughly, by feeding the widespread misconception that anything which does not fit snugly into today's broken environments is simply no great loss and ought not to be missed:<p><i>""We owe it to the losers in these little skirmishes to make sure that, if nothing else, the good ideas are not lost along with the framework.  And we do not accomplish that by defining that there was nothing lost.  That's both callous to those who worked hard on these other things and short-sighted to the future, which might one day care about the things that got lost.""</i><p><a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/msg/b2c0190dc30c3e5f?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/msg/b2c0190dc3...</a>",1261802951

1015717,comment,1015368,1015707,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Agreed that Limited is better. But it still costs money, yes? A new deck every time?<p>My problem with M:TG is that the <i>knowledge</i> keeps turning over. In 1996 I spent quite a lot of time playing, reading, tinkering with -- and buying -- Magic, and as a result I knew all about the best Magic strategies and could follow the top players with interest. Then I looked away for six months, and when I looked back I was a hopeless old man and had no idea what was going on. Yeah, I had some appreciation of the format and the principles, but all the standard tactics were different -- new cards meant new ascendant strategies.<p>I eventually decided that, if I take up gaming again in such a serious manner, I'll play and study bridge or chess or Go or Scrabble or poker or something where, should I happen to acquire any skill, it will persist for more than a year or two. Heck, even Settlers would be a good choice; that game has legs.",1261802916

If the situation were truly so astonishingly extreme, wouldn't the USA become a major net exporter of airline-pilot talent?<p>Come to think of it, <i>is</i> the USA a major net exporter of airline-pilot talent? And if not, why not? Is the fix in, as it is with doctors and lawyers? (Getting a medical degree is one thing, moving to the USA is another, but getting licensed to practice medicine in the USA without a <i>US</i> medical degree is, alas, a third.) Or is the language and cultural barrier too high? (I was under the impression that international airline pilots all spoke at least enough English to communicate with air traffic control, which is to say: pretty decent English. You'd think that you could have a pretty decent life as an expatriate American airline pilot.) Or would it just cost more than folks are willing to pay?",1261802321

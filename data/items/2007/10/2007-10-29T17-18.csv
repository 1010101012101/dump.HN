73845,comment,73657,73657,0,0,edw519,,,"When you SHOULD Rewrite Your Software:<p>When it's a house of cards.<p>Perhaps I'm a little jaded, but I've built a very nice career rewriting software that never should have been written in the first place.  Of the existing code I've encountered, at least 95% would never have passed a code review by me (or anyone else who knew what to look for).<p>The problem is that we're so committed to pass user acceptance testing that we never subject the source code and data base design to the same rigors.<p>I like to think I've seen it all: one and two character variable names that mean nothing, homemade routines for <sorting, selecting, you name it>, memory leaks, iterations to nowhere, upward branches to nowhere, data base schemas that would make M. C. Escher jealous, and on and on and on.  Face it, if programmers were doctors, we'd all be dead.<p>As a constant victim of the ""You Can't Get There From Here Syndrome"", I often tell my clients the same thing, ""It's not how soon we get started, it's how soon we finish AND how capable we are to handle the next revision"".<p>Often rewriting is the last best hope.

Yahoo and Google and Microsoft all have the elements of a social networking but chose not to pursue it, or half-assed it over the year, but I have more faith in Google being able to pull it off and succeeding than the other companies or even Facebook. But then again, the point of Facebook was never to care about social networking, they aspire to be an advertising powerhouse.

73830,comment,73674,73674,0,0,coffeemug,,,"While there are many ways to skin this cat, it seems like the right way to approach it is to consider the offer from your POV, not from an obscure universal concept of fairness.<p>Assuming you believe in the idea and in the ability of the two people to execute, what do you think the valuation will be at the time of acquisition? I know it's black magic, but suppose you arrive at a number of ten million. Once you arrive at this number, make an estimate for the time frame of the project. Suppose you decide the acquisition will happen in two years. Is 2% of ten million ($200,000) after two years of work for no pay acceptable to you given the high risk of the enterprise? If so, and you feel you won't be able to make more money elsewhere, take the opportunity. If not, look for something else.<p>The valuation and time frame estimation is voodoo, but figuring that out is a whole separate issue.

My first startup with a couple of friends asking me to build them a site for 3% equity and some percentage of the sales. They valued their idea wayyyy too much. Half year later, they raised it to 15%.<p>If you can build it yourself and like the idea. You should do it. Their 2% with no salary is insulting. ",1193678210

This is an expected payout .. assuming a 33% chances of success given that its a ""good"" idea .. the company shud be worth at least $10.5m a year later. Given that u are taking such a risk .. and will do lots of the work .. u want 3-5 times that money at the very least .. so do u think the company might be worth $50m one year down the road with a proability of 33%?<p>Hmm .. the calculation is really slightly orthogonal to ur question perhaps",1193678044

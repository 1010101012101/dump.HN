Your workers work better; your community supports you; your customers favour you. It's good PR, and every <i>lasting company that makes lots of money</i> does PR.<p>But apart from the ideal capitalist (who doesn't exist, sorry), the human species has an instinct for cooperation and for belonging (not always requited). It's not intellectual or calculated, it's just part and parcel of the animal that is homo sapiens, as much as being bipedal. It's why sacrifice is at the centre of popular films (e.g. Titanic), and why members choose to hang out with each other, and to devote themselves to something. I surmise that the reason why humans evolved this instinct is because cooperation and unity are very effective at promoting survival and growth - which today is largely handled through <i>a business or enterprise.</i><p>[1] for example, see <i>Built to Last</i> and <i>Good to Great</i>",1234691749

481881,comment,481777,481851,0,0,albertni,,,"Actually, I don't think MIT cultivates as much of an entrepreneurial culture as you might expect, especially considering how solid the computer science department is, and how there's the Sloan school. It's kind of hard to describe, and I didn't go to Stanford so obviously I can't truly compare the two.<p>I loved MIT but I can say without a doubt (unless things have changed dramatically in the last 9 months) that you don't see flyers recruiting for startups, and startup CEOs/CTOs tend to be more than a stone's throw away. The caveat here is that a lot of (compsci) professors at MIT were indeed at one point involved in a startup of some sort, but it's not the kind of thing that everyone knows about (so they might be a stone's throw away, but in disguise, which is effectively the same thing). Almost nothing about being at MIT made me think ""after school I want to be involved in a startup"". Ironically, I now work for one.",1234691489

It is really how for driven and greedy, (please don't neg me), people to channel their energy into money making, as that is the emphasis.<p>2. The brand power.  It will unlock you doors just b/c of the name, especially in the corporate world.  Think of it, nobody will get fired b/c they hired a Harvard grad,  just as as nobody will get fired b/c they use java, or xml.<p>3. Connections.  Lot of smart people, and some of them will be bound to be somewhat important one day, so they can help you out. the proverbial old-boys-club kinda of thing.  This was true, especially during the wall street's financial bubble madness.<p>To get a inside look, check this out.  It is a good read.

HBS doesn't quiet get tech.  Since you are working with case studies, you by default are looking/studying the past, and not the future. 
For traditional businesses, yes.  Fedex was started there (as a class project), so my favorite dessert place  (Finales).<p>Disclaimer:  I haven't gone to HBS, but I know people that have, and have been to few of their classes as an observer, and took some classes at Harvard Extension.

That may change now that the economy has shifted somewhat dramatically.<p>Anyone interested in HBS should read Philip Delves Broughton's book ""Ahead of the Curve"" about his experience there.",1234689653
481872,comment,481777,481854,0,0,spencerfry,,,"It’s 4 AM, but I can chime in on that quickly before I go to sleep. I think that without much hesitation people would agree that a liberal arts education by definition is well rounded. You take English classes, science classes, math classes, foreign language classes, history classes, etc. Through your liberal arts education you learn a large breadth of material that when taken together helps to make you a very well rounded person intellectually. There's something to be said for specialization, but you can specialize on your own time.<p>I’d argue that being well rounded, social, and able to converse on many different subjects will serve you a million times over in your startup. There's far more to building a successful startup than a good idea, design, and code. That’s the easy part and it’ll certainly get you off the ground. But to truly run a successful startup, every aspect of your life and your personality will be tapped. Business by its very nature is a social thing between people and a liberal arts education, and the “college experience,” will serve you well in getting past that first stage and on your way to a legitimate business. If you want to be running things rather than working for someone, you need these qualities.<p>Disclaimer: I graduated from Yale in 2006 with a Psychology degree after being Computer Science for the first two years. Programming just wasn’t for me. Psychology wasn’t exactly my major of choice (although, lots of it is very thought provoking), but it allowed me the most freedom to choose the courses I wanted.",1234689461

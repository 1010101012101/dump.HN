I have read the article and thought &quot;so here is another gimmick that steals away a bit of my privacy, so what? no big deal&quot;. And that&#x27;s scary.<p>Is it though?  To be honest, this article is pretty light on substance.  I read through it all because the guy is a good writer, but the only revelation here is him realizing the microphone device he put in his kitchen is... <i>gasp</i>, listening to him.<p>If it turned out Amazon was actually recording and storing everything, that would be quite the revelation.  If it turned out your data wasn&#x27;t being deleted when Amazon said it was, that would be quite the revelation.  Otherwise, there&#x27;s just not a lot here other than a semi-humorous story about accidentally insulting a robot.",1448222339

Totalitarian surveillance states are very possible without modern (2000+) electronic devices and have existed for a good half century. To add to that, there are many other technologies that are essential to the kind of centralized bureaucracy that totalitarian states generally use. Without electronic communication, it would be extremely difficult to disseminate policy. Without electronic storage, it would be very hard to collate descriptions of suspects and centralize information. The parts of the Catholic church of the middle ages would very much have liked to run a totalitarian state - but it was beyond the technology of the time.<p>So, if you think we should oppose technology that allows states to survival and terrorize their citizens, there is a longer list to go after: police, vehicles, computers, electricity, etc. All of these technologies gave rise to fears that they would restrict freedom and those fears were ultimately realized. In many ways, we are far less free than people who lived in societies without electricity or cars or any of those things. However, we are also safer from many groups that used to use their freedom to take advantage of others (though not all, obviously).<p>I agree that this kind of electronic surveillance (or, more specifically, the ability for machines to collect and collate information) is transformative. It&#x27;s similar to other technologies that changed things - the telegram, electricity, plumbing, etc. It will alter the balance of power and we, as citizens, should think about how we want this technology used and not used. However, I find the idea that this technology _in particular_ is any more or less totalitarian than ones that have come before it to be silly on its face.",1448221189

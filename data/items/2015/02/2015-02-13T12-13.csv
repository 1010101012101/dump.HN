The cheap chinese ones I also tried lasted on average four months (I bought 8 bulbs), all of them blew up electrolytic capacitors on the buckpucks (with release of magic smoke).<p>As for the needing an electrician part: remote socket receivers are a well proven, cheap and safe technology requiring no electrician to install it.

Some magic pill, or maybe a powerful quote that could instantly short-circuit my anxiety loop. Having your brain second-guessing every other thought doesn&#x27;t help in developing and keeping habits.<p>I&#x27;ve tried SSRI - they did help reduce the baseline, so panic attacks are mostly things of the past, and I have little bit more willpower (at the cost of the usual side effects I won&#x27;t name).<p>I&#x27;ve tried diet and exercise before and didn&#x27;t notice significant improvement in anxiety levels or cognitive abilities - but then again I was optimizing for weight loss, not for well-being, so maybe I should just try a different diet.<p>I&#x27;m having hard time getting myself to trust any other therapy than CBT and the only CBT practitioner in my town that I know about is a private, expensive doctor.

9044028,comment,9042282,9042282,0,0,tokenadult,,,"I post a fair number of stories about regulation of medical treatments here on Hacker News. I see this one has attracted a lot of reader interest. The comments already posted as I post this comment point out that once someone sets up a regulatory program, the incentives become powerful to figure out ways to cheat the regulators. And, as usual, scientific research is hard (another topic I post a lot about here), and researchers all operate under incentives to publish interesting and hopeful results rather than acknowledge that their research program didn&#x27;t show what the researchers hoped to show.<p>The submitted article identifies a specific problem in how the FDA doesn&#x27;t publish identifying details of studies that its own inspectors discovered to have problems. Biomedical researchers, then, don&#x27;t know which previous study findings are flawed, even though the FDA detected flaws, and much time and effort is wasted trying to pursue research results that don&#x27;t reflect reality. That has to change.<p>Meanwhile, there is a different pattern of regulation for some products that consumers in the United States take regularly as they seek better health, namely &quot;natural supplements.&quot; For natural supplements, the regulatory problem is far worse, because those products can go on the market with no research done on safety or effectiveness at all, and without even any guarantee that the product contains the labeled active ingredient,[1] a plain violation of the warranty of merchantability in the Uniform Commercial Code.<p>So the better trade-off for the consumer here is to amend existing law so that as drugs go through clinical trials, disclosure and peer review of FDA inspection findings during the trials is a condition for marketing approval. If manufacturers can&#x27;t deal with that kind of regulation, tough. But it&#x27;s only fair that natural supplement products, a multi-billion-dollar industry, should be regulated the same way.<p>(To answer a question asked in another comment, already well answered overnight in my time zone, yes, &quot;science-based medicine&quot; includes &quot;evidence-based medicine,&quot; that is clinical trials, as a subset of practices that include also consideration of fundamental principles of science and statistical understanding of prior plausibility before interpreting clinical trial results. If a sample size is small enough, many implausible treatments can look like successes in a clinical trial, especially for subjective, patient-self-reported symptoms, but we shouldn&#x27;t call such treatments effective until they have been replicated in larger samples and verified with independently gathered &quot;hard endpoint&quot; data about clinical signs.)<p>[1] &quot;Searching for the supplement in your supplement&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/searching-for-the-supplement-in-your-supplement/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/searching-for-the-supple...</a>",1423831586

The study then said that drinking no alcohol was associated with dying sooner than drinkin alcohol.  The curve they released showed most benefit to people drinking one drink a day, but showed benefits over not drinking at upto about 5 drinks a day.<p>That was different to what we thought before.<p>It turns out this new study has a bunch of flaws.

Panel members usually recuse themselves under those circumstances.<p>I don&#x27;t care if you work for the pharma, but please don&#x27;t keep posting demonstrably false comments shilling for the industry:<p>&quot;Since the lion&#x27;s share [of FDA user fees] can only go to expedite approvals, that area of the agency has grown while staffing and resources in other parts of the FDA have been relatively starved. As drugs enter the market faster, it becomes increasingly difficult for the FDA to perform its other functions -- including monitoring drug safety, ensuring manufacturing standards, and regulating marketing. [...]<p>Furthermore, the FDA is subject to industry pressures through its eighteen standing advisory committes, which consist of outside experts in various specialties, are charged with reviewing new drug applications and making recommendations to the agency about approval. The FDA almost always takes their advice. Many members of these committees have financial connections to interested companies. Although there are conflict of interest rules that prohibit participation in such cases, the agency regularly waives them on the unlikely grounds that someone&#x27;s advice is indispensable. USA Today examined FDA hearing records in 2000 and found that &#x27;at 92 percent of the meetings at least one member had a financial conflict of interest,&#x27; and &#x27;at 55 percent of meetings, half or more of the FDA advisers had conflicts of interest.&#x27;<p>Members of FDA advisory committees are said to command unusually high consulting fees from drug companies. They are certainly in a position to do so. They probably don&#x27;t even have to say, &#x27;Pay me if you want your drugs approved.&#x27; According to the Washington Times reporter August Gribbin, &#x27;One drug company executive who asked not to be identified referred to the advisory committee members&#x27; approaches for obtaining [consulting] work as &#x27;shakedowns&#x27; because a company that refused to yield to such requests could doom products that cost tens of millions of dollars to develop.&#x27;&quot; Source: The Truth About Drug Companies, p. 209",1423831082

A group has more resources. Making multimedia content accessible isn&#x27;t required of individuals because it&#x27;s proportionally excessive. In the same way a small store might not be expected to fit a wheelchair ramp but a supermarket would be expected to (indeed floor level access would probably be stipulated at the planning stage if it weren&#x27;t already by the supermarket corp).<p>To put it a different way: if one child comes up to you and asks for food out of a genuine need, you&#x27;ve got a truck full of food. You&#x27;re probably going to feel morally obligated to feed them. Now suppose a whole country comes to you and says they need food. With that same amount of food you&#x27;re not going to feel morally obligated.<p>So, it seems there is some cut off at which the available resources compared to the size of the problem make a difference. I think that is enshrined in the ADA in USA and certainly is in the DDA in UK law.<p>The final element then in the OP is that (C) Harvard and MIT have the resources and so should also carry the obligation.<p>I think this is actually where I don&#x27;t agree. That whilst as a whole they have the resources, for this project they do not. The allocated resources for this project mean that if the obligation were applied to make release of videos require captions and braille transcripts and such that the means available would not be sufficient to continue the project.<p>An analogue question might be: Does a chain of tiny convenience stores have an obligation to put in wheelchair ramps in some stores even though for the specific store it would be an excessive cost relative to their income.<p>tl;dr I think it comes down to compartmentalisation of the institutions.<p>[Perhaps maxharris you&#x27;re right but just need to present your argument differently?]",1423830673

Rosenblum, NAD’s CEO.  “Yet both Harvard and MIT betray their legendary leadership in quality education by denying access to approximately 48 million Americans who are deaf or hard of hearing. All they have to do is provide accurate captioning to such online educational content, yet they provide no or inaccurate captioning which is contrary to these schools’ ideals of excellence and service to all.”</i><p>&quot;Betray&quot; is a <i>very</i> strong word, just the sort of thing to provoke an angry reaction.<p>Then there&#x27;s the fact that they don&#x27;t actually call out any specific online courses for not having captioning (which unless OCW has been spending a lot of their money in their new mode on this should have been trivial), but stuff of much less importance, of course leading with a discussion of the holy <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>, as well as e.g. Bill Gates and Chomsky talking.<p>Then there&#x27;s the criticism of the quality of what appears to be Youtube auto-captioning of videos of nothingburger Lady Gaga and Obama visits placed on official Harvard and MIT Youtube channels.  Unlike the 3rd example of the President of Liberia talking about Ebola at a Harvard Political Institute event, the only sane thing for institutions to do with the former sorts of events is to not publish them in any form with audio on any venue.<p>That, plus a lot of the wording, including stuff you incorrectly assume implies that &quot;<i>that these schools were given the resources to &quot;build a ramp&quot; and just decided not to</i>&quot;, is <i>clearly</i> designed to provoke an angry reaction.

If you are interested in fine art and history then almost anywhere in Europe puts you less than a two hour flight away from every European country.  Of course for another type of fine art and history it&#x27;s hard to beat China but you won&#x27;t see much of it if you get stuck in Shanghai or Beijing, you need to get out into the countryside, take trains, buses, local taxis, etc.
But if all you want is a job in marketing or sales then it will probably be tough to break in because you will lack the connections and social knowledge specific to the place.  If you are only intending it to be for a year then you should probably aim low on the job front and look for something with more flexibility rather than money so that you can get time to explore.
On the question best pay and hiring most: these can be in conflict.

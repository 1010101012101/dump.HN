3556855,comment,3555894,3556103,2,0,Jach,,,"If you start from the premise that there are only two hard CS problems then all hard CS problems must be a special case of one or both of those two. So cache in an on-chip memory sense is conflated with disk storage is conflated with distributed disk storage. This isn't necessarily bad, Smarty for example caches rendered files to disk storage and calls it a cache, but it does show off the problem of naming things. (That and every variable named ""data"".) Anyway, I imagine what the GP was getting at is that if your data distribution isn't particularly deterministic enough (e.g. swapping hard drives in and out when they fail) you have to deal with validation that a particular data changing command (store, delete, whatever) actually propagated to a sufficient portion (in some cases all) of the servers and that the introduction of new or changing or rogue servers doesn't affect that. The more apt term for this is consistency. Related is the CAP theorem which says for any distributed system, you can only pick any 2 of consistency, availability, or partition tolerance, though it's more interesting to talk about atomic operations, where transactions are/where they might be desired, and whether things get faster or slower with more data.",1328522203

3556852,comment,3555894,3556726,1,0,ecdavis,,,"I'd like to point out that I believe what you're saying is technically incorrect - at least as it applies to Facebook. It is my understanding that when you ask Facebook to ""delete"" your content, that is (or at least should be) exactly what happens. From Facebook's ""Statement of Rights and Responsibilities""[1]:<p><i>1. For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Facebook (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.<p>2. When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).</i><p>From their Data Use Policy[2]:<p><i>When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted from Facebook. It typically takes about one month to delete an account, but some information may remain in backup copies and logs for up to 90 days. You should only delete your account if you are sure you never want to reactivate it.</i><p>And, finally, from a Facebook employee here on HN[3]:<p><i>Maybe that was true in the past, but today when you delete your data it is gone. Trust me, I wrote it myself. The law enforcement guidelines that have been circulating recently corroborate this.</i><p>I believe the above quotes demonstrate that Facebook, at least, do have a legal reason to delete their copy of your media when you no longer want it hosted there -- and that they actually do so. Maybe that will change in the future, but I hope not.<p>Personally, I think it is dishonest to use the term ""delete"" when you simply mean ""remove this reference to"", and I appreciate Facebook distinguishing between account deletion and deactivation. To most computer users, delete implies that the thing is gone and can't come back. Using that term to mean something else is deceitful. As such, I believe sites that allow users to ""delete"" their content do have a moral obligation to actually go through with that and delete it entirely, not just make it invisible to the user.<p>It is my view that once a service becomes culturally entrenched, it becomes accountable/responsible in many ways to its users. This attitude of ""well, if you don't like it don't use it"" is an interesting one (and it's something I adhere to for the time being), but I wonder how long it can last. Recent SOPA outrage demonstrates that people generally don't have this sort of attitude towards governments. The differences between the two are clear, of course, but there are similarities too. I find it interesting that people[4] will condemn, for instance, full-body scans at an airport as being an invasion of privacy but then have this cavalier attitude towards corporations like Facebook - hey, you agreed to the terms and conditions! At what stage does that agreement become entirely meaningless?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/legal/terms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/legal/terms</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/your-info#deleting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/your-info#deleting</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3320240"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3320240</a><p>[4] Not you, dotBen, but people.<p>EDIT: I'm sorry to see you've been downvoted.

3556843,comment,3554863,3555980,3,0,tensor,,,"Reviewers are <i>intentionally</i> hidden from view. The reason is to prevent social or political backlash from a poor review. In fact, it is sometimes the case that papers reviews are <i>double blind</i>, the reviews do not know the names of the authors either. This is also to prevent bias on the part of the reviewers. This secrecy is a positive and important part of the peer review system. Science should not  be politically or socially biased.<p>The immutability of published works is also crucial. It routine for writers to leave out details covering in prior works. This saves immense amounts of time on both writers consumers of scientific works. However, it also means that it is crucial that all cited works be preserved forever. If a document truly goes missing, then entire lines of work become incomplete. Papers can and are infrequently withdrawn, but as far as I know, the work is not erased, but merely marked as bad.<p>The way updates or corrections are made is via newer papers revisiting topics. But it remains that at every step some amount of decent due diligence is done to correct errors and not clutter up the records with incomplete versions.<p>As great as the web is for unstructured content, you cannot easily apply it to every area, and especially not to scientific publications. There are plenty of other examples of curated sources on the web that crucial. Map systems, curated databases of restaurants, directories of people like LinkedIn and Facebook, and even Wikipedia can be counted a curated system due to its system of editors.<p>Scientists have always and are still free to share data, white papers, and whatever else outside the peer review system. The main reason peer review is still here is that no suitable alternative has ever been proposed that addresses all the points that peer review does. There <i>is</i> a push towards open access journals to benefit the world at large though.<p>I understand that you are passionate about this, but I'm not convinced by your arguments.",1328521905

But if you aren't aware there is the EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) repository for RHEL and CentOS.

If you get something out of it, you win.  You treat it as the word of God, but don't take it very seriously.  :-)  I think God must really hate it with people desperate to know what He thinks so they can do it.<p>God says Line: 76214<p>of the LORD your God.<p>7:1 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the\nword of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth\nmonth, even in Chisleu; 7:2 When they had sent unto the house of God\nSherezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD, 7:3\nAnd to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the LORD of\nhosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month,\nseparating myself, as I have done these so many years?  7:4 Then came\nthe word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying, 7:5 Speak unto all the\npeople of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and\nmourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did\nye at all fast unto me, even to me?  7:6 And when ye did eat, and when\nye did drink, did not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?\n7:7 Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the\nformer prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and\nthe cities thereof round about her, when men inhabited the south and\nthe plain?  7:8 And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying,\n7:9 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment,\nand shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother: 7:10 And\noppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor;\nand let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.<p>----<p>If God does any cool miracles, treat them like fireworks.  I'm referring to when stories seem written for today, for example.<p>Maybe, God doesn't like Shakespeare.  What about Dickens?  Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol.  Now, that I think about it, that puts Shakespeare to shame.  God said that period of time was not pleasant.<p>God says Line: 96567<p>salvation perfect through sufferings.<p>2:11 For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all\nof one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, 2:12\nSaying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the\nchurch will I sing praise unto thee.<p>2:13 And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and\nthe children which God hath given me.<p>2:14 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,\nhe also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he\nmight destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;\n2:15 And deliver them who through fear of death were all their\nlifetime subject to bondage.<p>2:16 For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took\non him the seed of Abraham.<p>2:17 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his\nbrethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in\nthings pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the\npeople.<p>----<p>I'm chuckling because I was an atheist.  When you have proof, it's really no great virtue being for God... more like, ""Well of course I'm gungho for God now that I know He exists!""<p>God says Line: 65996<p>the land of Moab, and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses:\nnone shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting.<p>48:34 From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto Jahaz,\nhave they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, as an\nheifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be\ndesolate.<p>48:35 Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that\noffereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.<p>48:36 Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine\nheart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the\nriches that he hath gotten are perished.<p>----<p>Umm... why did You cause atheism?

3556743,comment,3556324,3556324,2,0,jorangreef,,,"Wisdom and collective decision making are not the same thing. Wisdom is not a shifting changing quantum, nor is it a set of rules. Wisdom at its best has always insisted on clearly defining the parameters within which we are to play and within which our lives can be best enjoyed.<p>The fool at his best will doubt the goodness of the goads of wisdom and will insist on his ability to define those parameters for himself leading him to folly and ruin. The tendency of wisdom is to be absolute. The hubris of the fool is to say there is no absolute.<p>If anyone would be wise, let him start with Proverbs, quoting from the beginning of chapter one:<p>""Their purpose is to teach people wisdom and discipline, to help them understand the insights of the wise. Their purpose is to teach people to live disciplined and successful lives, to help them do what is right, just, and fair. These proverbs will give insight to the simple, knowledge and discernment to the young. Let the wise listen to these proverbs and become even wiser. Let those with understanding receive guidance by exploring the meaning in these proverbs and parables, the words of the wise and their riddles. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline. Listen, my son, to your father's instruction and do not forsake your mother's teaching. They will be a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck."" - Proverbs, <a href=""http://bit.ly/aJpmva"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/aJpmva</a>",1328519331

At face value, this would indicate that they are making $31 for every $1 that their competitors make. As opposed to $24 to the dollar when they had 4% market share and 50% profit.<p>So either they are increasing prices (not happening, we can see the price on their website), so they are increasing their margins in some areas.<p>I was originally thinking about the relative percentages, which is not right.",1328519175

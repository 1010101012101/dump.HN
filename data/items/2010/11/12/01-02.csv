The chances of Google failing are much lower than the chances of Facebook growing its revenues (or prospects) 5X.<p>Price (ie working for shares) is an estimation of probability. I'm not saying Facebook is worthless. It's worth a lot. The reason Facebook's valuation isn't $100b already is because the road from here to there is an uncertain one. The two factors I would consider to be important are: (a) Facebook's revenue model is relatively immature.(b) Facebook might be a trend.<p>*I think Facebook might even have the potential rival Google in advertising.

Whereas when a weaker kid fights back, even if the bully is strong enough to ""win"" the battle, he still gets hit in the mouth and does not like it. Bullies much prefer low-hanging fruit that doesn't fight back. ...""</i><p>There are always consequences, failure to prevent bullying, failure to check payback. Failure if you do nothing. The payback pattern is culturally prevalent but flawed. [0] The payback pattern might work but it escalates violence. There are better ways that allow you to hack people and their behaviour to get at the root cause at a higher level than the individual. The approach can be top down or bottom-up, it doesn't matter as long as the level of violence is reduced. This is also the inherent weakness of the solution, but it holds more promise for the greater good than payback.<p><i>""However, you will never use force to do anything but protect yourself or your friend.

From this, all the things we produce seem more valuable than they are. Of course, we aren't actually <i>selling</i> these things to that many people in other countries. Instead we coast on the credit China is willing to conveniently advance us to buy their goods. We're ""so productive"" we no longer need to produce ... that much.<p>The world's overall currency and trade relations are amazing unbalanced with both US and Chinese policy makers apparently willing to feed the illusionary value of the dollar for as long as it suits their mutual policy interests.<p>Silicon Valley is a huge source of innovation but it's one of last things of value to the world that the US has. There are other things on that list but the list hasn't gotten longer for a while now.<p>Also, US government spending is on-par with Europe (~33%+ of GDP!) but the US somehow provide little to no ""safety net"" to its citizens.

Imagine if you were a customer who actually had noticed the issue. Would you consider 30 cents to be reasonable credit? All this is, is cheap advertising. A marketing gimmick.<p>The way to judge a companies customer service is to look at how they handle a problem you have. One of the reasons I have a negative view of Netflix is because I had a problem with their service, and they handled it poorly. I'm still unhappy about it. So if you're thinking about how wonderful Netflix's customer service, ask yourself if you ever ran into a problem significant enough for you to contact Netflix, and how they dealt with it. I think a lot of the praise for Netflix's customer service is either based on cheap marketing like this, or (and I have to give them credit), the easy process/leeway they give to common problems (wrong/damaged DVD).",1289524942

It is academic.<p>It works in exactly the same manner that Western academia has for much of its recent existence, in which discoveries are published, shared, collaborated on, and built on, albeit at a pace much accelerated by the ability to collaborate in real-time over the Internet, instead of having to wait for the publication of monthly journal articles and expensive lab experimentations (like the LHC).<p>Just because the people involved in FOSS are not doing this directly for money does not mean they're giving away the fruit of their labor for free, or being coerced as Soviet Communism was known for.  While creating things that directly improve their own lives (scratching their own itches), they also gain the opportunity to spend their lives living their passion doing stimulating work, gain recognition amongst a group of peers spread all around the world, become known as experts in their field (leading to paying gigs from commercial outfits), and create things with the potential to advance the human race and make the world a better place.  All of it 100% voluntarily, uncoerced.  If that's not Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness, I don't know what is.<p>Go reread what Ayn Rand says about trading value for value.  Whether you're trading the fruits of your labor and talent for money, or for something else of value to you, either fits just fine with her philosophy.  Ultimately, she was an advocate for the creation and fair exchange of value and real wealth, of which money is just a store, and without coercion.  There is absolutely nothing about FOSS that is incompatible with her beliefs.<p>This is one of the biggest problems with the Conservative movement these days, a misunderstanding and misapplication of their own ideology.  Too many seem to have merely a superficial understanding of it, a worldview that if corporations, direct profit motive, and consistent % improvements in quarterly statements aren't the driving force behind something then it can only be the antithesis of Truth, Justice, and the American Way.  Be it FOSS, Net Neutrality, movements to reduce corporate spending in politics, if corporations are against it or orthogonal to it, then it must be anti-American.<p>Einstein once advised that 'everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.'

2102875,comment,2102564,2102810,0,0,lsc,,,"the number of people who can effectively code for 10 hours a day for a period of months is... small.  Nearly everyone I know who claims this ability spends a lot of time doing things like reading hacker news rather than coding.<p>This, I think, is one of the tests of a manager.   A bad manager loves to see people looking busy.  A bad manager will hire people who claim to work 10 hours (or more!) a day.  This manager will quite often stay at work with everyone else (it doesn't matter how early you show up, as long as you show up before the boss.  It doesn't matter how late you leave, as long as you leave after the boss.)  but he usually slips into dealing with personal business.    And so does nearly everyone else.<p>I think a much better approach is to let people figure out what their optimum productivity is.   I know one guy who says ""i have four good hours a day""  -  and he is very, very good during those four hours.   But after those four hours, really, you might as well send him home to play video games or something.  He's done.<p>Expecting 10 hours a day of work on average encourages a culture of deception;  a culture of ""look busy""  which really, isn't any good for anyone.   Yeah, I want you to work as much for me as you can.  But really, if you are going to work for five hours a day and screw off on facebook the other five?  I'd prefer you just go home and do something fulfilling.  You aren't making me any money on facebook, and destroying your home lives doesn't make me any richer.<p>Now, there are some people who can code, consistently, for 10 hours a day.   But they are dwarfed by the numbers of people who act busy for 10 hours a day to meet the expectations of management.",1294990880

2102873,comment,2102495,2102495,0,0,hoag,,,"I just wrote you quite a long story, so in case you don't have the patience to read it all, here's my recommendation for you (as echoed again at the very end):<p>If you have no backup of your data, I recommend taking your drive to a special data recovery center. I think the data is still there, but they will need to physically remove the platters from the enclosure and place them in a new drive with a new circuit board. It will probably be quite expensive, but it sounds like it will be worth it for you.<p>Ok, now my similar story:<p>I had a remarkably similar thing happen to me a few months back so I can't remember exactly what happened, but basically it went like this:<p>15 years of life on old 750GB HD, wanted to transfer to new WD Passport 1TB. Plugged it into USB, also got annoyed by the pop-up software, tried disabling it, nothing. Didn't use the full-on encryption, but did use a password to access the drive (it was immediate, so I'm assuming no encryption actually took place).<p>Anyway, then I realized it was annoying to always have to enter the password whenever plugging in the drive, and in any event, I just didn't like the ""feeling"" of some weird third party software -- the WD pop-up software -- managing a password for my critical data.<p>So I elected to remove it. I don't remember whether I was successful, but what happened next was terrifying: I couldn't access my drive. Same as you, only the WD VCD software loaded but the drive itself wouldn't mount.<p>This was on a modern MacBook Pro running the latest version of OS X btw. So I immediately tried booting up into Windows, and even tried an actual Windows box as well. Weirdly, the Mac and Windows device managers were able to see SOMETHING there, but they couldn't access it.<p>The drive would spin up, but nothing else. Nada, zip.<p>So I immediately took the drive back to the Apple store, and one of the employees walked in and before I could even tell him what happened, he said, ""Let me guess, your brand new WD drive just failed?""<p>Turns out they have a circuit board problem: after testing, they concluded mine had failed, and that apparently circuit board failures on those drives, if they happen at all, happen within the first 24 hours of use.<p>So then I faced a dilemma: how do I get my money back and get rid of all my data? There was no way to format the drive before sending it back, and I wasn't going to entrust 15 years or more of my life to some employee at WD somewhere to just physically destroy the drive.<p>Long story (not so) short, I elected to just swallow the $150 and keep the drive, i.e., keeping my personal data, well, personal, was worth $150 to me.<p>So I went out and bought a Seagate and just recopied my data.<p>As I said above, if you have no backup of your data, I recommend taking your drive to a special data recovery center. I think the data is still there, but they will need to physically remove the platters from the enclosure and place them in a new drive with a new circuit board. It will probably be quite expensive, but it sounds like it will be worth it for you.<p>So sorry for what you've been through, I know how it feels...... :(",1294990728

2102871,comment,2102388,2102783,0,0,pyre,,,"I'm curious what the bias of patents classes in law school are (at least in your case). Are lawyers really taught that when an engineer brings them an 'invention' to patent they are supposed to try and expand the scope of that patent to absurd levels just because they think that they can sneak it past the patent examiners by making the language so obtuse that the simple act of inhaling and exhaling clocks in at 2,000 pages?",1294990487
2102870,comment,2102388,2102847,0,0,jessriedel,,,"That argument would be plausible if Amazon was patenting a particular <i>logistical implementation</i> of 1-click purchase.  (""This is a specific device which allows canceled orders to be tracked and routed back to inventory..."")  But they patented the entire concept, which would prevent even companies with trivial logistics from allowing 1-click purchasing without paying Amazon royalties.<p>And indeed, according to Tim O'Reilly, Bezos defended the broad patenting of all types of 1-click purchasing.  Here is an excerpt of O'Reilly's description of their conversation:<p>> First off, Jeff wanted to explain why he thought 1-click was original enough to patent. It has nothing to do with the implementation, which he admits is fairly trivial to duplicate, but with the reframing of the problem. At the time he came up with 1-click shopping, everyone was locked in to the shopping cart metaphor, because that's what you do in the real world. You pick up an item and take it to the counter to buy it. On the Web, he realized, something very different was possible: all you had to do was point to an article, and it was yours...<p>>What's more, Jeff went on, small inventions can often seem extremely obvious in retrospect. The patent literature is full of this kind of thing. The significance of an invention isn't how hard it is to copy, but how it reframes the problem in a new way.<p>> This may be true, I replied. But it is hard to believe that if Amazon hadn't introduced 1-click ordering (if they were indeed first to do it), that someone else wouldn't have done this. It beggars the imagination that this is so significant and unexpected an innovation that others should be prevented from using it. Patents are meant to promote the common welfare, the idea being that certain ideas won't be developed without government providing a degree of protection. Is this an idea that required that kind of protection to be developed?<p><a href=""http://oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/ask_tim/2000/bezos_0300.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/ask_tim/2000/bezos_0300.htm...</a>",1294990338

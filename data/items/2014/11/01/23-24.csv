Note that FRP is incremental in the time dimension (add a new time point to the program, you don&#x27;t have to recompute the program for previous time points), but we really want more than that (don&#x27;t recompute parts of the program execution that are not affected by changes in the time point).<p>It isn&#x27;t clear to me that arrowized FRP is incremental.

It isn&#x27;t impressive being an 80% prosecutor. It&#x27;s much better to aim to be a 95% prosecutor and take the risk of a wrongful prosecution. Go big or go home.<p>I wonder if there&#x27;s a better way of determining if someone is good at a job. I mean, it is natural for us to like people who do really difficult things, but if many people take great risks, there&#x27;s likely to be at least one who just happens to succeed due to circumstances. Did he succeed because he&#x27;s better or because there&#x27;s a 5% chance of succeeding and he just happened to do so? It seems like he succeeded against all odds, but what if that was just pure luck and it seems impressive because we don&#x27;t see it as throwing a hundred darts (a hundred prosecutors) at a board and seeing one strike the bull&#x27;s eye (one with no wrongful convictions)?",1414886047

With 20MB photos common these days, you need the data coming off a blazing fast local SSD. Otherwise, you can&#x27;t flip through your photos in a reasonable way. It takes too long to move from one to the next, and every web app does that thing where they load this horrid blurry version first while waiting for the full-resolution version to load. Unacceptable (to anybody who&#x27;s ever experienced instantly flipping through a hundred pics off a fast SSD, anyway).<p>So a web app can&#x27;t do it, but you <i>do need</i> a web app component, and cloud storage strategy, to solve this problem. People&#x27;s local SSDs are typically too small to store all their photos. Plus, you want your photos everywhere, on all your devices.<p>So not only do you do need to architect a web/cloud component, but you either need to create a native app for all devices, or at least create an integration with the local photo management facilities on each platform, so that the subset of photos people want are in fast local storage.<p>It&#x27;s a hard problem. Meanwhile, my own 500GB of photos (I used to have only maybe 20GB, but then my kids were born) are just sitting in a big folder, with no organization at all, waiting for somebody so solve it.",1414885661

Hence we&#x27;ve seen terrible stories about people prosecuted and jailed for years because prosecutors knowingly refuse to turn over exonerating evidence.<p>Judges are also part of this problem.  They are paid by government.  Their instructions (Rules of Criminal and Civil Procedure) come from government.  They have often worked as prosecutors for the government.  So their loyalty is to the government.  We don&#x27;t have an independent judiciary.  It&#x27;s been wholly captured by the government.<p>Getting to the question as to why the innocent plead guilty, when you&#x27;re faced with the cost of an attorney it&#x27;s often cheaper and easier to take a plea than to fight.  The stress, emotional and mental toll of a legal fight are horrendous.  And there is very little guarantee that a defendant will win.<p>The deck is stacked against you when you go to court.  Prosecutors and judges are not there to have a colloquy about the law, the facts, the issues of the case, nor to debate the motivation and intent of the defendant.  The prosecutor is there to win.  The judge is there to ensure that the well-oiled machine keeps running and that jurors deliver the needed verdict.",1414885270

Happy to buy as I&#x27;m looking for something that isn&#x27;t online only.<p>I&#x27;m a regular user of Diigo, about 10K links, 500 different tags.  Don&#x27;t like it being cloud only.<p>My favourite feature is my ability to annotate a link (mostly highlighting text), so it effectively creates a chronological and topical feed of the exact sentences of what I want to remember from a link. It&#x27;s kind of a self writing blog of what I read and experienced, complete with what stood out to me, and any notes I wanted to make.<p>I find I more remember a point or a sentence from a link than the link itself, and having a full text search of the words I remember highlighting and saving is incredibly powerful. I actually end up revisiting those links.<p>I have some experience with research and filing large databases of articles and images at a job in another life.<p>Look forward to chatting :)",1414883219

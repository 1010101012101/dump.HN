If you're holding it upside down in your hand, the built-in orientation sensor would simply rotate the grid correctly.  The less thinking a user has to do, the better.<p>In other words, it could actually work better than the treo (another phone with a touchscreen), which you definitely can't use to enter a new number blindfolded with its tiny keyboard.  And, you could hold the phone upside down and dial the same way, which no conventional phones let you do.  A voice announcing the keys is a great idea, as well, since most phones use tones for keypushes.<p>This would be great in an additional way, because whenever somebody tells you a phone number, they can follow along.  ""My cell is 111.2345.  ""  ""Ok (enters it on the iPhone, and a voice speaks each number.) One. One. One. Three. Four..""  ""NO, no, I said 2345.""",1177449517

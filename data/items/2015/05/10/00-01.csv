I am regularly diving through code at my new job trying to figure out how everything fits together. Reading code split between various functions and figuring out program flow is a necessary skill, even if you do keep monolithic functions.<p>I would love an IDE that showed inline in some sane manner function calls, letting me recourse arbitrarily deep - some thing ala code collapsing and expansion. Extra points if you can show a for chart to side of function calls, class interactions and general code flow, highlighting where your cursor is. More points for a pane that shows what variables have to be in order for a the branch of code you&#x27;re working in to be reached. A changeable granularity setting would be great for all of these.<p>I think often times we discuss pros and cons without discussing what they could be if we put some effort into changing the current situation.",1431219548

I was the tools programmer at a game studio, and few years ago was given the task to speed things a bit. There was a process that was summing neighbouring pixels, doing some filtering/pre-processing then calculating a value through log, so I&#x27;ve profiled that this was the slowdown, and decided to provide a faster log version. After some googling, and testing it seems everything should&#x27;ve work.<p>Few days later, black mipmaps started to appear. Turns out, I was doing testing in a wrong way, where I was thinking I&#x27;m comparing new to old, where I was comparing old to old created by other machine (a bit different results due to be expected). All because I forgot to turn off caching.<p>And my approximation of log2 did not really worked for the most of the numbers involved in.

That is the big tradeoff.<p>One could hope that with many of these utils they&#x27;re mostly IO bound, and so a scripting language wouldn&#x27;t change that much.  I know at one point I actually had a python based md5sum that was faster than the regular gnu one for big files - as it loaded the data off the disk in huge chunks.<p>I believe ack-grep was written in perl?  And that&#x27;s pretty fast.<p>Also - how fast does it <i>Actually</i> need to be?  It&#x27;s not high-frequency-trading or a 60fps game... A computer these days can probably load perl, run a script, and display the output faster than a computer from 20 years ago could run the original c util...  And if everything is written in it, then a lot will be already in memory.  If your shell is written in it too, then you could just call the utils from within there, rather than having to fork/exec it anyway.<p>For most higher level scripting languages (such as perl, python, ruby, etc). Things like regexps and hash tables are written in c underneath anyway.<p>With a lot of shell scripting, you call many many utils many times - which would slow everything down hugely if you needed the scripting language startup costs each time.  However, if you use the same higher-level scripting language to write all your scripts in - rather than writing SH scripts that call your utilities, then you might even get faster than SH calling external utils (possibly).

He then used inscribed and circumscribed polygons to prove upper and lower bounds on the area thus derived, with (in modern parlance) the two bounds converging in the limit <i>n</i> → ∞, thereby establishing the result. The rigorous method of exhaustion (due originally to Archimedes&#x27; predecessor Eudoxus) is effectively equivalent to integral calculus (~2000 years ahead of its time), but guessing the right answer would in many cases have been difficult or impossible without the non-rigorous mechanical method.<p>Incidentally, the mechanical method itself might have been lost to history had it not been for the discovery of the <i>Archimedes Palimpsest</i> in a medieval prayer book [1], which contains the only known copy of the work describing it. Often called simply <i>The Method</i>, it takes the form of a letter from Archimedes to Eratosthenes, the chief librarian of the Library of Alexandria. When I had occasion to see some original pages of the palimpsest last year (at The Huntington Library in San Marino, adjacent to Pasadena, California), I was struck by the collegial tone of the letter, whose genuine human warmth was instantly recognizable even across two millennia.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes_Palimpsest"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes_Palimpsest</a>",1431217894

I had some intuition for how things worked, but it often took hours of hard debugging. I perceived code purely operationally - &quot;This line sets this variable to 5&quot;.<p>* At some point, you start structuring things into modules, subroutines, etc. You might learn &#x27;best practices&#x27; and try intently to practice each one. You&#x27;ll unit test everything, or otherwise hold strong opinions on how things should be done. Debugging is approached in a more scientific manner. You start to feel like you can get a handle on just about any bug, since you have tools and methods for reasoning about them. There is a lot of focus on verifying code, but not so much on validating. I perceived sections of code as implementing some intuitive concept - &quot;This class represents a bullet, and its methods are reasonable things for working with bullets&quot;<p>* Now, I rarely spend any time worrying about the best practice of the day just for the sake of it. I generally focus on getting the current task done, but I intuitively know when to apply a certain practice. For example, I might write a test or two after writing algorithmic code. I rarely spend any time at all debugging my own code, since it tends to just work. Since verification is so easy, most of my focus is on validation: &quot;Am I even building the right thing? Will this way of laying things out have acceptable performance characteristics? Does this way of laying out the types mirror how I think about the problem?

You can contact people directly too. Do so succinctly and with an eye to why you think they in particular would be interested. Friends and family are also a typical source of very initial capital. Since at the earliest stage all anyone has to go on is how competent you are, and to some extent how compelling the concept is.

Especially if you consider development process, I had absolutely no idea what it took to build successful teams.<p>At around 30 I started to clue in and I can recall some designs which were actually not too bad in retrospect.  Of course, a lot of the stuff that is taken for granted now (design patterns, TDD, etc) was not well known at that time and so I was exploring and learning things that few other people had experience with.<p>As another person posted, I&#x27;m also nearing 50.  I would say that my code has improved a fair amount and I have learned a lot of other techniques which I didn&#x27;t really know in my 30s (like FP).  Rather than technique, though, I think the biggest thing I&#x27;ve learned is patience.  I code <i>very</i> slowly compared to how I coded 20 years ago, but I think a lot more about every line.  Kent Beck once said that when he wrote Smalltalk Best Practices that he started to evaluate every keystroke and to think <i>why</i> he was pressing that key.  I find that I am doing that a lot now and it is very beneficial.  The advice I give the young guys on the team the most is, &quot;Stop typing so fast!  You need to think about what you are typing&quot; :-)<p>As I said, the biggest revelations for me are less about pure technique and more about how everything fits together.  For example, my less experienced colleagues are often distraught over the perceived sins of the other people on the team.  They worry endlessly about how to stop the &quot;crappy programmers&quot; (in their eyes) from &quot;ruining&quot; the code base.  Nearly 50 year old me weighs the options and realizes that complaining/campaigning/scheming/negotiating/etc will take an order of magnitude more time than refactoring and will suck the fun out of the room.  I like refactoring code and I hate arguing, and besides young people tend to be crap at cleaning (in general).  So I clean things and eventually most of the others catch on -- not everybody, but it&#x27;s enough.<p>I still get stressed out a lot and I&#x27;m hoping by the time I hit 60 I will have resolved those issues :-)",1431216943

9007672,comment,9004689,9007086,0,0,otoburb,,,"First time stumbling across Beaker Notebook. Looks great! Recently heard about Jupyter[1][2], which is a project to generalize the IPython backend to be language agnostic. Are the various Two Sigma financial services entities using Beaker internally? Seems like a natural fit for the highly mathematical nature of the work Two Sigma staff and entities are engaged in.<p>Interesting tweet from one of the IPython/Jupyter devs[3] last year about Beaker. Jupyter and Beaker state similar missions, although Beaker seems to have focused more on &quot;multiple languages within a single notebook&quot; leveraging the IPython backend. Sounds like the two projects can both co-exist due to the slightly different emphasis influencing each project&#x27;s trajectory.<p>[1] <a href=""http://jupyter.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jupyter.org/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://speakerdeck.com/fperez/project-jupyter"" rel=""nofollow"">https://speakerdeck.com/fperez/project-jupyter</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://twitter.com/Mbussonn/status/481108119633035264"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/Mbussonn/status/481108119633035264</a>",1423195197

Even if sexual orientation is due in part to environmental factors, that does not imply mutability once established.<p>To answer your question, I don&#x27;t think it should be allowed in principle - probably not for anyone but particularly not for minors. The effectiveness of the treatment has not been established at all, for one, and it causes a variety of disturbing side effects in people in the form of serious mental health issues, regardless of the outcome of the &#x27;treatment&#x27;. For that matter, since sexual orientation is not a mental health issue in the first place, it&#x27;s impossible to justify treatment even if it is effective. If reparative therapy were a pill, and I were the FDA, there is no way in hell it would pass human trials. In fact, I&#x27;m pretty sure it wouldn&#x27;t even make it <i>to</i> human trials.<p>This is complicated somewhat by the fact that psychological treatment (i.e. as opposed to <i>psychiatric</i> treatment which involves medication) is more lightly regulated in many jurisdictions, if at all. Perhaps that should also change. But especially in the case of minors, and especially for reparative therapy in particular, where in the overwhelming majority of cases parents are clearly not approaching it from the perspective of what&#x27;s best for their child - no it should not be allowed.<p>> How about convincing you they weren&#x27;t doing it deliberately, but instead were chasing ratings using controversy and not caring about long-term societal results?<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s exclusive to using media for social control. In fact, it&#x27;s sort of an important part of it, since you need everyone paying attention and giving all the bullshit the undue consideration it totally doesn&#x27;t deserve.<p>To be clear, I don&#x27;t think there is a single grand conspiracy to bring all of Western civilization under the control of a handful of oligarchs, and that this conspiracy involves media control. Rather, I think that various psychopaths in positions of power are involved in various petty conspiracies with other psychopaths, and some of these people happen to own media organizations. And, probably some of them have also convinced themselves that in fact they <i>are</i> involved in such a grand conspiracy - it would be something to point out and laugh at if the effects of it weren&#x27;t so awful.",1423192651

But even then, most sites I've seen aren't smart enough to require confirmation to change the email address once registered so it does no good.<p>Companies should just offer RSS feeds for people who really want junk solicitations.",1200117554

Login cookie is next.<p>account/login tabbing: I'll fix that. Thanks.<p>The time calculation is based on midnight of the date you select on the Add Fueling page. I'll add the time of day, but I don't think people keep track of their fueling habits that closely.<p>Regarding editing, I've removed your NULL date, so you can log back in. I'll add verification to prevent that from happening in the future.<p>Again, thanks. Awesome.",1200117206

Lots of OSX apps use XML in .plist files and nobody cares because that's just a detail of the class library the devs use and an OSX app without a nice configuration panel is unthinkable.<p>However, visible XML configurations are a symptom that your app is about to be assimilated into the borg collective.",1200116702

97450,comment,97384,97384,0,0,crescendo,,,"The design is very clean and appealing. Also the function is user friendly. Some cursory testing uncovered the following bugs:<p>Location: /<p><pre><code>   Sign up\n      \n      - ""email address"" should select or disappear on click.\n      \n      - password should be empty.\n      \n      - login cookie?\n</code></pre>\nLocation: /account/login<p><pre><code>      - Tabbing should go from the ""Login to fuel"" field to the password field. Currently focus vanishes on tabbing from this field.\n</code></pre>\nLocation: /fuelings<p><pre><code>   - Past fuelings: The time calculation is wrong. It shows 21 hours for an edit I made ~5 minutes ago.\n   \n   - /edit\n   \n      - commit button still says ""Add this fueling"". Should say something like ""Update"".\n   \n      - values are old (e.g., change the ""Gallons"" value, and click the button. Dashboard shows new value. Click to ""edit"" the fueling again, and old value still shows here).\n      \n      - Date text box allows invalid date values. Replaced ""JANUARY"" with ""PLUTO"", and date disappeared from dashboard. On the next access of dashboard, got a ""NoMethodError"" on line #68 of fuelings/index.html.erb.\n</code></pre>\nI was never able to access the app again after the last error.",1200115294

97445,comment,97273,97436,0,0,dcurtis,,,"Interesting thoughts.<p>But the fact remains, they weren't really using the neurons as a ""brain"", which is what the article/headline claims, they were just using sophisticated software to find an ewualibrium point and self-correct.<p>They were hacking the neurons, yes, but only at the most basic level of neuron function. The author misrepresented the facts by suggesting it was ""learned"" behavior, and that is, I think, shameful.<p>If the neuron cluster actually learned something, then it would be pretty amazing.",1200114300

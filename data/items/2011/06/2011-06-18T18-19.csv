Most of the kernel work I did was in C, but just two things had to be done in assembler:<p>1. Putting the CPU into 'idle' mode when no processing needed doing.<p>2. Putting the CPU+memory into 'standby' mode when running on batteries and it hadn't been used for a while.<p>This second feature was slightly challenging as the memory had to be put into standby mode first, then the CPU put into standby mode, but of course you couldn't access the main memory after it had been put into standby mode, but did have to carry on running instructions to then put the CPU into standby! The solution was to ensure that all the code required to put the CPU into standby mode (and then after wake-up, get main memory back out of standby mode) was in the CPU cache, so it didn't need the main memory to execute.<p>I've also recently used a tiny amount of assembler to implement computed goto's when using a C compiler that didn't natively support them<p>I'm fairly sure that people who require insane speed in tight loops also code in assembler, but I've never needed that myself.",1308423101

2669234,comment,2668267,2668969,2,0,rwl,,,"I use StumpWM: <a href=""http://www.nongnu.org/stumpwm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nongnu.org/stumpwm/</a><p>I personally think the whole ""Linux Desktop"" issue is a bit of a red herring.  GNU/Linux (and, I assume, other libre Unixes) is the only widely-available OS I know of where it is even possible to use a graphical environment <i>without</i> the ""desktop"" metaphor, which I see as a huge step forward.<p>To me, the ""desktop"" is all about entrenching the various kinds of boring, repetitive work that computers are supposed to <i>relieve</i>.  This insidious metaphor is implicit in everything about how desktop environments are used and developed:  the way users are encouraged to scatter icons across their screen for fast access to files, instead of encouraging organization and fast access via searching; the presumed importance of ""office"" software that most users could replace with a typewriter and a calculator; the focus on making the environment ""intuitive"" from the first moment one uses it, at the expense of training the user to eventually learn to use their computer more effectively and efficiently.<p>I would much prefer to see the free software community put its efforts into building graphical environments that eschew the desktop metaphor, and instead focus on making it easy for the user to off-load work to the machine.  Part of that task is making it easy for the user to discover what the components of the environment are, how they work, and how to recombine them in novel ways.<p>A good test for this, I think, is how well a graphical environment supports a task like data entry, because it's the kind of thing that just about every computer is going to have to do at some point, and it is often a mind-numbing task.  It's often mind-numbing not because the task is boring, but because most ""desktop"" environments provide no way to offload the cognitive advances you can make while doing it.  After a few records, you know you have to check that field C looks a certain way relative to fields A and B, or that it's faster to enter field E before fields D and B, etc.; but the software you're using provides no way to encode this information, so you have to remember this boring algorithm and execute it repeatedly yourself, instead of letting the computer handle the algorithm while you focus on edge cases.<p>The challenge is to build an environment that a user can offload the algorithmic aspects of their work onto, without requiring the user to be a full-on programmer, at least not at first.<p>Free software has already taken some significant steps in this direction.  Tiling window managers, the OLPC's Sugar interface, and even to some extent programs like Emacs are examples.  We're ahead of the game when it comes to building a new metaphor for working with a computer.  We just need to recognize it.",1308422963

2669185,comment,2668346,2668787,1,0,iskander,,,"(I'm going to agree with your first sentence by disagreeing with everything you said about market making)<p>>  Look at market making (providing liquidity for other traders). There's an intrinsic demand for liquidity from funds which try to manage an index, hedgers, and speculators. The goal of market making is to provide liquidity to facilitate those other traders. And yes, there's a small premium for the service, but the fact that the premium is shrinking over time reflects a lower cost for the rest of society.<p>I think that's a very quaint view of market makers, maybe valid 20 years ago but it seems disconnected from modern circumstances. Market making has largely become synonymous with algorithmic trading, which now accounts for somewhere between 25%-75% of traded volume (obviously varying widely between markets, see <a href=""http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2011/03/04/505021/algo-trading-and-the-nymex/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2011/03/04/505021/algo-tradi...</a>).<p>A significant subset of the prop traders have been spiraling into a latency arms race, which has gotten to this absurd point where even millisecond-scale trading is considered slow.<p>Regular old market making (put orders on both sides of the book, make profits from the spread) only seems to work in the absence of significant competition. In reality, profitable firms are running all sorts of short-term speculations and even trying to prey on the trading behavior of people & other algorithms. There have been all sorts of algo-induced pricing anomalies documented at <a href=""http://www.nanex.net/FlashCrash/FlashCrashAnalysis.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nanex.net/FlashCrash/FlashCrashAnalysis.html</a>.<p>The supposed benefit of all this nuttiness is improved liquidity, but I wonder: Who needs liquidity at the millisecond scale? What business, other than algorithmic speculation, will suffer if they have to wait 1/2 a second to buy or sell something?<p>Also, I question whether the premium of modern prop trading  is actually small-- there are a large number of prop trading firms that seem to be doing extremely well for themselves. I don't know the specifics, but I wouldn't be surprised if the sum of prop trading profits reach high into the billions.<p>Furthermore, these companies siphon off a large number of smart grad students, who would have likely otherwise done something actually socially productive with their time.",1308421337

This is entirely layer 2, has no routing, no useful path metrics, and is completely unsuited for a network larger than a few nodes if you want any sort of reliability/usability.<p>True meshing algorithms like 802.11s or BATMAN can optimize the mesh topology, but you're still on one huge broadcast domain.  The proposal needs to establish a means to restrict the size of these domains - convert each node (or a subset of supernodes) into ""routers"", and roll out a routing protocol which is optimized to this type of ad-hoc, organic deployment.<p>The other problem with scaling (no matter what your meshing algorithm does) is the half-duplex nature of RF - if you're doing this with single-radio SOHO routers, you're going to lose half of your throughput per hop.  I run two 500-node muni WiFi nets, and we try <i>never</i> to exceed 2 hops between a node and its backhaul gateway - any more and you're in the sub-1Mbps range on 802.11g rates.<p>Fix these problems and you may be on to something.

2669126,comment,2668887,2669077,1,0,nextparadigms,,,"I was thinking lately that it seems that in time new companies appear that have the <i>incentive</i> to move things forward.<p>For example, Google has the incentive to make the web as fast as possible because they are mainly a web company, so it's in their interest to do that, while for Microsoft and Apple, the web might not be their first priority, and at times they might even try to restrict it, so it prolongs the survival of their own platforms.<p>In the same time, I was thinking about Facebook's Project Spartan, and how they have an incentive to create a webstore  that works on all platforms, while Google's incentive is to have it work only on Chrome, or more recently to have some of their services work only on Android. In this case it would be both's Google's and Apple's incentives, to keep us as locked in as possible on their platforms, while it's Facebook's incentive to liberate us from the locked platforms.<p>And this is where I wanted to get. I think there will be companies that will appear in the future, that will have the incentive to make a fully decentralized P2P Internet work, and once again none of the ""old"" giants, whether it's Facebook, Google, or even Apple and Microsoft, will like this idea. For example, both Facebook and Google would hate the idea of a completely anonymized Internet, because that goes directly in the opposite direction from their profit incentive. But, like I said, I think there will be companies that will be able to make that work in their favor, and thrive from it as it becomes their main profit incentive to support it.",1308420261

It is fundamentally the transfer of the entity to A which removes it from B.<p>It therefore cannot apply to an idea, for which A getting his hand onto the idea will not make B forget about it.<p>For copyrighted works, creating a copy is is not depriving someone of the original entity, so it is not stealing, but counterfeiting.<p>Along the same vein, you can't steal something from someone if he has not acquired it in the first place. Creating a copy of an entity and selling it or giving it for free might cause monetary grief to the original owner (which might sell his entity for less, if at all, than if the copy did not exist), but it is not stealing either.",1308420082

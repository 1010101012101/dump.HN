2866231,comment,2865305,2865590,2,0,blahedo,,,"> <i>I've never understood the ""no open windows but still running"" model</i><p>Here's a very specific use case that comes up all the time (for me, but I think it's more general too) where this model is superior: I have a folder-ful of files that I need to go through one-by-one.  In my case it's usually assignments my students have handed in.  What I want to do is open the first one, then Cmd-W Cmd-O and look at the next one, and so on.  What I have to do if I'm unlucky enough to be on a windows machine is open the first one, look at it, open the second, click or Ctrl-Tab to the first, close it, and then look at the second.  This is excruciating.  Alternatively, I could keep one dummy file (or perhaps just the first one) open while I sequence through the rest.  This is also annoying.<p>This is roughly the same reason (or one of them, anyway) that I also like the screen-wide menubar: at least some actions are relevant to the program, not to the document, and there's no reason that I should need a document open to execute those actions.",1312937748

2866151,comment,2865273,2865650,3,0,qaexl,,,"Some context. I started this current gig 18 months ago. I develop on Ruby on Rails (of course), and ultimately deploy it into the Rackspace Cloud. I also wanted to mess around with Opscode Chef. I had also watched friends and business partners struggle with MacPort for years, and watched them struggle with bundler and rvm more recently. I wanted to skip that.<p>I'm actually using VMWare Fusion. My employer had an extra copy. I run VirtualBox at home. The platforms are not exactly the same, but my beefier gaming box running (now older version) of VirtualBox seem slower. For the purpose of developing in a VM, I don't think it really matters between VirtualBox or VMWare technology-wise, as long as you have some sort of command-line tool to bring up new VMs.<p>I wrote some bash scripts to clone VMWare images, including filters to search name references and rename them to the image. You can use Vagrant to do the same with VirtualBox, and from the demos I've seen, it is a <i>easy</i> way to get into this setup on your MBP.<p>I built out a template with 256M + 10 GB slices, just like on Rackspace Cloud. On the i5 MBP, I allocated a single core to each slice. On my current i7/8GB setup, I'm allocating two cores. I've also had to beef up two of the slices from 256M to 512M and 1G so that I could run the full rspec against the apps. I have tried allocating all 8 hyperthreaded cores, but I guess VMWare Fusion isn't quite like Xen. I generally run no more than two slices at a time. VMWare Fusion makes it relatively easy to suspend VMs, and I don't jump around on a number of projects so I have not needed to hot-potato things much.<p>I had not had problems with VMWare with regards to idling. Both VMWare Fusion and VirtualBox are now using Xen-style paravirtualization, so when it is idle, it sits idle. When it does eat up computing cycles when idle, it has more to do with Rails (or Merb) polling inappropriately. With this setup, I've had problems on the i7 MBP kicking up the fan for no apparent reason and I suspect it is Chrome or Flash.<p>Wakeup/suspend by closing the lid works on the VMs. Linux doesn't even know the VMs have been suspended, so I don't mess with any kernel settings for that. On the downside, these VMs currently run on an independent wall clock which means resetting the clock if I want accurate timestamps on commit logs. There's probably a setting to fix that.<p>I'm using Gentoo for the distro, but that doesn't matter as much as using the distro you like or better yet, using the distro you are deploying against.<p>Editor-wise, I am shelling in with ssh and using vim + Rails.vim against screen. (I'm also using Terminal.app + Visor and iterm2 w/ visor mode). I have a customized /etc/hosts file with shortnames for the VMs so I can shell in fast on the occasions I do shell in. (I have flirted with shelling in and using Emacs -- it works wonderfully well, if I wanted to abandon VI modal editing).<p>Each slice is configured with two virtual ethernet devices, one going to physical ethernet device (bridged) and one going to the virtual LAN (no NAT). Since I sometimes go use free wifi and they require IP authentication, I don't see the point of exposing the internal slices to the world. Instead, I installed Nylon through MacPorts and have it turned on to accept SOCKS5 requests from anything inside the virtual LAN. On the VM side, I have proxychains set to talk to Nylon on the outside. This way, I only have to web-authenticate once on the free wifi and prepend my git pushes with proxychain. With the virtual LAN, the intent was so I can always shell into my vm on my laptop regardless of my external network connectivity.<p>One nice thing about this setup: at some point, when the Gems start accumulating and start bogging down load time for Ruby and Rails, I can drop it and clone a new VM.<p>Due to some circumstances, I'm going to be getting an i7 Air by the end of this month and I'll replicate the setup. I may use Homebrew or Gentoo Prefix on the host side, but I'll still continue to use some sort of virtualization of Linux. I'm skeptical about drinking the 'brew ...<p>I have a friend with a similar setup. The friend has to run Windows to do proper browser testing so he has different requirements. He also has FUSE running with a Samba shared folder so he can use TextMate on the host side and run things on the Linux side. I've only had a few occasions where I wished I could do that, virtual DropBox-style, but it hasn't reached the level of scratching-itch yet.",1312936163

The tools exist, they've been implemented for years across a variety of industries and they come in all flavors. There should be no need for a restaurant operator to ever have to get on the phone with their technologist, and I use that term loosely, and request an item change and any developer with a couple of years experience should know that.<p>The reason they're so shitty, imo, is that restauranteurs are ocd-minded workaholics who spend most of their time focusing on their own operation and very little time researching the technology aspects of their industry or comparing themselves outside of their business column. Just pick up any of their trade publications. They simply don't have the time or the inclination and more often than not the money to go out and hire a bonafide design or technology firm to implement a solution for them. They see what other restaurants are doing, calculate the costs of copying them and call it a day. As long as nobody else is innovating, why should they?<p>Another aspect of the business that leads to poor internet marketing is the people that they have filling those positions. I'm willing to  bet that upwards of 90% of the people who make the decisions on the restaurant's website have a) no business experience, b) no technology experience, c) no desire to be anything than someone who works at a restaurant, as long as they don't have to serve food or pour drinks. They are, and having worked in the industry for many years, mostly an underachieving lot who are most happy sucking down a cold beer that a friendly bartender comped them. Seriously, I build web-based, cross-platform financial applications and my restaurant friends still ask me to help them with the Yelp. They have absolute no clue what the internet has become in the past ten or twelve years. And if they can get their favorite cocktail waitress' friend to put together some crap website, then they're just as happy. More often than not, you'll have to print the pages out and send the paper site along with the invoice so they can look it over.",1312935574

2866088,comment,2865484,2865484,47,0,grellas,,,"A few thoughts:<p>1. Under Rule 24(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the court must grant Apple the right to intervene as of right if Apple can show: (1) that it has filed a timely motion to do so; (2) that it claims an ""interest"" in ""property"" that is the subject of the action; (3) that its ability to protect its interest in that property may as a practical matter be impaired or impeded if the legal action is allowed to be disposed of without its participation; and (4) that existing parties cannot adequately represent that interest.<p>2. Consistent with this rule, Apple's legal argument boils down to the idea that it has a license from IV to protect, and rights under that license, all of which will be impaired or impeded if Lodsys is allowed to pursue infringement claims against developers who develop apps for the environment to which Apple's license applies. Hence, Apple must be allowed to step in to defend the integrity of its license and to argue, based on that license, that Lodsys is barred by the doctrine of ""patent exhaustion"" from pursuing claims against the developers.<p>3. Apple thus argues that it needs to be in the case to protect its own interests, not those of the developers. Now, <i>de facto</i>, this might amount to the same thing since Apple does not want to face a revolt among its developers. But there is irony here in that Lodsys is arguing, as one of its major points on why Apple should not be allowed to intervene, that Apple has no obligation legally to hold the developers harmless (i.e., based on Apple's agreements, the developers are on their own). In seeking to intervene to argue the patent exhaustion doctrine, then, Apple is saying it will protect its license rights primarily and developers only incidentally and, again, without undertaking any legal obligation to indemnify any developer.<p>4. All that said, ""patent exhaustion"" is a potent defense, the effect of which (if upheld) would be invalidate the patent for misuse. ""Misuse"" here lies in the idea of extending the exclusive rights afforded by the patent grant beyond their legitimate scope. Apple's ability to prove misuse, though, is by no means easy. To show misuse, it will essentially have to show that the IV license was intended to cover separate products (apps) that did not even exist when the license was granted and that do not constitute an integral part of the Apple product when sold. This will be tricky at best and obviously will take a party of Apple's sophistication and wherewithal to marshal the arguments and factual development effectively. That, of course, is why Lodsys does not want Apple in the case. It would much prefer to bully smaller and less sophisticated parties because that is how patent bullying works best.",1312934901

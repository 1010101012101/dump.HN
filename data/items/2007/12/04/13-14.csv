The main reason is that chess is a game of perfect information whereas Poker is a game of imperfect or partial information.

I actually once measured how much time was lost in a day because of its suck.  It wasn't insignificant, and it didn't even begin to cover the emotional effects on productivity.  I hated it with a passion, to the point where it would be personal revenge for me to drive Peregrine out of business (at least out of the trouble-ticket software business).",1196775093

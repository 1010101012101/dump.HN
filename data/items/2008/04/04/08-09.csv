Even if you consciously know it's worth it in the end, there are subconscious forces within us that are not as far seeing.<p>So you need willpower to get past some local lows. Without it, you'd have to restrict yourself to goals that can be accomplished with only constant enjoyment along the way. That leaves out many worthy goals, and most opportunities to create value.",1207298236

I find it slightly paradoxical that I associate Buddhist meditation with a passive attitude of just accepting the present and suppressing earthly desire, yet according to what you say, that activity actually improves one's ability to persist in the active pursuit of one's desires. Not a true contradiction, of course: both are instances of suppressing immediate desires in favor of more significant, delayed ones.<p>Besides any long term neurological benefits, I read once or twice that meditation and relaxation have an immediate effect of helping relieve the stress that lies at the root of most cases of procrastination.",1207297305

It's a big and complex subject: very roughly speaking the accuracy of the simulation tends to be proportional to the amount of computer power and time spent on it.<p>A really interesting question in the context of fluid dynamics for games is what is the simplest thing you can do which makes the movement of a fluid <i>look</i> realistic, without worrying about all the details of mass conservation, numerical diffusion etc etc that cause the computational fluid dynamicists to pull their hair out.",1207296886

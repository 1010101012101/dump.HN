It was so easy to add a note to pictures I had already taken. Immediate engagement win.<p>By the way, your sign-up introduction flow is awesome. I love how all the permissions I granted (location, photos) had context as to why I gave them. That&#x27;s a huge deal, since most apps just ask for what they need on immediate startup and I always get really annoyed. More apps should emulate this design!<p>Awesome work!",1386291574

Before ACA you would pay based on cost...<p>Based on the data in that report, females consume ~33% more health care than males from age 20 - 65. But under ACA men and women pay the same amount (men subsidize women). That seems mighty chivalrous. More specifically, it&#x27;s a very significant financial penalty for single men, and doubly so for men who marry men.<p>If you sum up health care costs for men versus women Age 0 - 64 (See Chart 28: Group PPO/POS data for calendar year 2010) you get $252k per man versus $309k per woman. I&#x27;m not sure I quite understand the justification why every man should be paying an extra $28,500 (on average) so that every woman can pay $28,500 less (on average) for their health care?<p>Interesting to consider... Given the demographics of most startups (young single men) and how ACA has a double sucker punch against being young and male... male dominated startups who want to offer insurance will be paying a hell of a lot more -- around 50% more to insure a team of 25 year old single men under ACA&#x27;s pricing regime.",1386291561

I walk to the grocery store and carry everything I buy, so I typically go twice a week and spend about $50 each time. It takes about 45min to walk to the store, shop, walk back, and unload groceries.<p>If this is $300/yr, that means I have to decide between going to the store myself, or paying $2.88 for amazon to deliver my groceries every few days. $2.88 to avoid putting on pants, interrupting my workflow, walking to and from the store, and waiting in line. That seems like a deal I&#x27;d take.<p>Then again, when I go to the grocery store, I usually walk to the bakery, market, etc. Plus, being forced to leave the house, wear pants, and interact with human beings has some advantages. Sometimes I get too comfortable being at home, and the fear of starvation is good motivation to get fresh air.",1386291414

That&#x27;s pretty straightforward... but in order for the client to get the API Key, they have to sign up, log in, potentially activate the token, or at least visit a page that gives them the token, and then they can use that token for subsequent API transactions.<p>My question revolves around how one secures the username/password authentication over REST for those initial phases.<p>I&#x27;ve been just handling traditional logins in the old client/server, non-REST model, and then, on login, setting a cookie with the token, that I then use to authenticate the other application interactions.<p>For username/password over REST, is SSL good enough?

Safeway has a pretty good delivery service in the US for next day grocery deliveries (pretty much as good as in the UK - apart from the website, which is pretty terrible).<p>Though, one of the perks of living in the Bay Area is Instacart. Instacart is 100x better than the UK delivery services since they offer same day delivery that generally arrives within 2 hours (and then there&#x27;s Postmates if you need things within 1 hour). They also have a subscription model like Amazon Prime Fresh where if you pay $99 a year you get free delivery for orders over $35 which is super useful.",1386290789

As a reward, people get prestige and career advancement.<p>Others journals a free to publish, but the readers pay an access fee.<p>In any case, in most cases the publication fee is much smaller than the time and effort needed to write a paper.<p>So a pittance fee - even $100 for all error corrections per paper - isn&#x27;t enough to change that overall market. You need to have serious money to make a difference.<p>If someone has evidence which, say, shows rabbits and velociraptors co-existed, then it&#x27;s more cost effective to publish that paper in its own right.

And we don&#x27;t.<p>> mathieuh is very much a leftist, and likely considers Mandela to be the same.<p>I also consider Mandela a leftist.

The way I justified spending a bit of money on Bitcoin when all of this hype started up a few weeks ago was to imagine Bitcoin taking over Western Union&#x27;s role in the market (which is a no-brainer...it&#x27;s already happening, and is very, very, very likely to be the first casualty of Bitcoin...Western Union has no reason to exist in a world with widespread Bitcoin adoption and availability). That one little aspect of the financial industry <i>alone</i> justifies a several hundred dollar Bitcoin valuation (I was doing this math when it was trading at $200, so that looked like a no-brainer investment to me).<p>Then, when you start looking further up the chain...PayPal, Visa and MasterCard, gold and silver for value store, and you try to figure out how PayPal could beat Bitcoin in a free market. I can&#x27;t see any way for PayPal to win. There&#x27;s nothing PayPal does better than Bitcoin. Literally nothing, and Bitcoin does it for less. So, if we assume Bitcoin subsumes Western Union <i>and</i> PayPal, it&#x27;s actually looking undervalued by a lot. If we follow that line on out, it begins to look more and more undervalued.<p>So, I like the method, but disagree with stopping at silver and money transfers. Those are the low-hanging fruit. Those are the things that will first feel the wrath of their customers for being more expensive and less convenient and more intrusive than Bitcoin. But, those aren&#x27;t the only things that will be disrupted by Bitcoin. It just takes a little imagination to see that the market cap for Bitcoin is potentially the same as the market cap for <i>every currency in the world</i>.<p>It&#x27;s damned near impossible to predict how this is gonna play out, but if it succeeds, Bitcoin is gonna be <i>huge</i>.",1386290107

I knew that pricing insurance plans was actually startlingly easy, I knew ACA limits the maximum rate adjustment due to age at 3x, but I was surprised the entire age-vs-cost curves are actually identical across plans. Apparently it&#x27;s not just the 3x overall delta, but the exact rating adjustment year-by-year which is mandated by law for all federally run exchanges.<p>That means to exactly accurately price a family&#x27;s insurance policy on Healthcare.gov, you need one array of 46 values (< 20, and 20 - 64), a &#x27;base cost&#x27; per plan per zipcode, and a tobacco adjustment. That is all, system ready for launch, thank you.<p>So then you have to ask, why doesn&#x27;t the calculator which lets you browse plan pricing let you enter ages for members of the family, and instead make you pick an age range and then give the lowest price within that age rate?  When they could have given exactly accurate pre-subsidy pricing by asking for ages and looking up the multiplier in a <i>global array</i>.<p>Now I&#x27;m really happy Paul Downs dug enough to uncover this, but I think he does make one false assumption. While the 2014 per-age rating factor curve is consistent across all plans, that does not mean that you can use 2014 rates to predict 2015 rates. The base prices for plans can change from year-to-year, and perhaps even the age rating factor curve itself will change in 2015. Just because the array is static/global, doesn&#x27;t mean it will be constant over time.<p>Paul does correctly conclude however that this pricing structure means you can take a single number for each policy and multiply times the employee count to immediately see the total price difference across plans. Of course, if you provide employees any choice in their own plan, it&#x27;s not that simple, but being able to boil down &quot;Plan A costs $X more than Plan B per person&quot; is cute.<p>However, it&#x27;s extremely hard to enumerate, let alone appreciate all the implications, trade-offs, benefits and hidden costs that come with imposing such strict and perhaps over-simplified pricing controls on a market.",1386289330

I&#x27;m not sure you can really say that he bore responsibility for that attack.<p>Before Mandela was jailed, when he was actively leading the ANC, he was careful to target only infrastructure and economic damage, not civilians. When Nelson Mandela was arrested, they were in the process of moving from that type of sabotage toward actual guerrilla action against the military, but were still not targeting civilians. Hmm. Escalating from boycotts and economic attacks to guerrilla warfare against the military; not too different than what Sam Adams did. What the ANC did after while he was jailed did escalate beyond that, but as far as I can tell, what he did and advocated never went much beyond what the American Revolutionaries did.<p>From the Truth and Reconciliation report <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/report/finalreport/Volume%202.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/report/finalreport/Volume%202....</a> volume 2 page 326-7:<p><pre><code>  In the course of the armed struggle, a number of military\n  actions took place which resulted in the death or injury of \n  civilians, and where gross violations of human rights can \n  be said to have been committed, despite ANC policy to avoid \n  unnecessary loss of life. Police statistics indicate that, \n  in the period 1976 to 1986, approximately 130 people were \n  killed by ‘terrorists’. Of these, about thirty were members\n  of various security forces and one hundred were civilians. \n  Of the civilians, forty were white and sixty black.\n</code></pre>\nA total of 130 civilian deaths is quite low for a violent conflict over that long of a period. That&#x27;s far lower than the number of civilian casualties caused by the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. Heck, per year the US has killed more civilians in Afghanistan than the ANC killed in that entire period.<p>I don&#x27;t endorse attacks like the Church Street bombing at all; I find them quite abhorrent.

Stop wasting time on 23andme, and pour resources in that. The FDA admitted that a whopping 70% of all supplements violate their rules.<p>>Dianetics/Scientology is neither a food, drug, supplement, medical device, nor anything else vaguely related to the FDA&#x27;s scope of regulatory authority.<p>Point is, these things make unwarranted health claims and cause consumers of them to take actions which directly harm themselves. If someone published health recommendations that tell people to drink bleach to &quot;cleanse&quot; themselves, the FDA can do nothing, but if someone tells them they have the BRCA gene and here&#x27;s a link to resource that shows it increases risk of breast cancer, well then, shut em down.<p>> I still don&#x27;t see that as an argument that the FDA shouldn&#x27;t act thoroughly within the domain they are charged with regulating now.<p>Right, the law says smoking pot is illegal, so there are millions of people who have had their lives ruined by the criminal justice system because of that rule, and millions more who have to pay billions for prison funds.  But yes, that is not an argument that cops and judges shouldn&#x27;t prosecute pot smokers to the fullest extent of the law and not prioritize, because, well, it&#x27;s the law! Ditto for illegal immigrants. Just ship em all back because it&#x27;s the law. Obama has been asked to de-prioritize going after pot smokers and illegals, do you think that is a bad idea and instead, he should prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law up until the last minute when the law is changed?<p>The law can be wrong. In this case, the FDA has been given the power to regulate something that straddles an entirely new industry and they are preemptively intervening before any harm has been shown. My argument is, regardless of the law, one can shift around one&#x27;s priorities. The FDA claims 70% of supplement makers are violating rules. Companies like Ranbaxy are shipping adulterated generics. These are actually harming people and the FDA has at least some authority.<p>There&#x27;s an entirely new industry cropping up around the &quot;Quantified Self&quot;. Individuals are gaining more and more power to monitor their biological systems, and personal genomics are just another in a long line of this evolution. The traditional power structures in the medical community do not like this decentralization towards consumers being able to get medical information about themselves without consulting doctors first, without doctors ordering tests, without doctors first interpreting the results.<p>I am stone cold libertarian on this. When it comes to my body, I demand the right to do anything to it, even if it may be bad for me, and to have any information on it, and to contract with those who can provide such information. My own concern is real fraud, that is, if someone says here&#x27;s a blood pressure monitor, that doesn&#x27;t actually measure BP, or here&#x27;s someone selling a DNA test, which actually gives me a totally false randomized DNA profile. My concern is not over someone giving my a dump of my DNA and then generating a series of correlated links to potential diseases. I will ultimately take that information and do the research myself.  Anymore than I am not concerned with a health site that takes my medical records or personal survey, and gives me a bunch of self-diagnoses diseases that match.<p>In short, where you and the FDA see &quot;health claims&quot;, I see a search engine.",1386289023

It seems like a solid investment strategy<p>This isn&#x27;t really an &quot;investment strategy&quot;, it&#x27;s just speculation - betting on the short term future and hoping it pays off. It&#x27;s a fun way to gamble your money, but it&#x27;s a lot riskier than the OP suggests. A &quot;solid investment strategy&quot; is putting a fraction of your paycheck into an index fund each month, not trying to predict the price of Bitcoin.<p>If you&#x27;ve really done your homework and you think the price of Bitcoin will go up in the long term, by all means buy a couple. Don&#x27;t worry about waiting for the price to spike down; in fact, maybe stagger your purchase over a period of time to smooth out any variation (this is called &#x27;dollar cost averaging&#x27;). Don&#x27;t try to speculate on short term fluctuation; you will probably get burned.<p>> Consider this: If you have $10k lying around [...] your $10k will become $14,262 after fees<p>Or, the price could drop to $500 and you&#x27;ll lose a few thousand. Can you afford to lose a few thousand dollars, even for a few months while the price recovers? Would you be better off investing it in something less risky? Do you know that you won&#x27;t need that money in 6 months to pay for emergency surgery, or to fund 3 months&#x27; runway for your new startup idea?<p>You should try to think of investment return as compensation for taking on risk.

The expection was you&#x27;d gracefully clean up, and fail whatever operation needed the memory, and if possible inform the user to let him/her free up memory before trying again.<p>This expectations in &quot;modern&quot; OS&#x27;s that malloc never fails unless the world is falling really annoys me - it for example leads to systems where we use too much swap to the point where systems often slow down or become hopelessly unresponsive in cases where the proper response would have been to inform the user - the user experience is horrendous: Swap is/was a kludge to handle high memory prices; having the option is great, but most of the time when I have systems that dip into swap, it indicates a problem I&#x27;d want to be informed about.<p>But on modern systems, most software handles it so badly that turning swap off is often not even a viable choice.<p>Of course there are plenty of situations where the above isn&#x27;t the proper response, e.g. where you <i>can&#x27;t</i> ask the user. But even for many servers, the proper response would <i>not</i> be fall over and die if you can reasonably dial back your resource usage and fail in more graceful ways.<p>E.g. an app server does a better job if it at least provides the option to dynamically scale back the number of connections it handles  rather than failing to provide service at all - degrading service or slowing down is often vastly better than having a service fail entirely.",1386288599

All lawful modes of expressing opposition to this principle had been closed by legislation, and we were placed in a position in which we had either to accept a permanent state of inferiority, or to defy the Government. We chose to defy the law. We first broke the law in a way which avoided any recourse to violence; when this form was legislated against, and then the Government resorted to a show of force to crush opposition to its policies, only then did we decide to answer violence with violence. But the violence which we chose to adopt was not terrorism. We who formed [Umkhonto] were all members of the [African National Congress], and had behind us the [ANC] tradition of non-violence and negotiation as a means of solving political disputes.

While I agree with the method by which he&#x27;s assessing the current value, I think it&#x27;s also amusingly conservative, which isn&#x27;t surprising.<p>There&#x27;s a long history of old business leaders viewing the technology that destroys them through the lens they view all of their traditional competitors, and vastly underestimating what it&#x27;s impact will be. Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma is one way of looking at it, but in this case I think that&#x27;s woefully inadequate of an explanation (i.e. comparing a new tech company against an old tech company).<p>Here&#x27;s the thing about Bitcoin, and the reason I&#x27;ve become really excited about it: If it succeeds, it means an end to banking and money as we know it.<p>You can&#x27;t compare that to Western Union, or PayPal, or Visa, or MasterCard, or even gold, or silver. It&#x27;d be like comparing the Internet to Time Warner Cable or Clear Channel or book publishers or books, in general. It doesn&#x27;t make sense. They&#x27;re wholly different levels of abstraction.<p>If Bitcoin really succeeds, it is nearly impossible to predict its value, because it will change the entire financial world (and it will look like it happens overnight, even though it&#x27;ll be 10-20 years before we see all of its effects). So, if this analyst is predicting what will happen to Bitcoin in January, he&#x27;s probably right. If he&#x27;s predicting what will happen a year, five years, and ten years down the road, he&#x27;s gonna be in for a big surprise.",1386288187

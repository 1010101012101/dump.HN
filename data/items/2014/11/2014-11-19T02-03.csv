8627960,comment,8627241,8627241,0,0,rajens,,,"This lecture was a bit different from most of the course lectures and not because it was hardware focussed. I felt like it was a lot more &#x27;high level&#x27; with less tactical startup takeaways as compared to other lectures. His slides were very elaborate, but lacked real actionable content. In many ways, they were what I&#x27;d call &quot;business school&quot; or &quot;management consultant&quot; style case study slides geared towards bringing design thinking to a larger organization. He even mentioned a couple of times- the difference between him needing to force people from different disciplines in a room together versus being able to do it sitting at a table when you&#x27;re just starting out. I think that was a prime example of the difference between &#x27;startup&#x27; thinking and &#x27;growth&#x27; thinking. I would&#x27;ve loved to hear more about his process for thinking about design when they just started the company.<p>In any case, I did find value in his lecture and thought process around treating everything as a system (instead of looking at hardware, software, data all discretely). I&#x27;ve tried to capture my takeaways via publishing 22 Quotes that I took away from the lecture here: <a href=""https://medium.com/@RajenSanghvi/22-quotes-from-hosain-rahman-on-how-to-design-hardware-products-dcd995e4aefd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@RajenSanghvi/22-quotes-from-hosain-rahma...</a>",1416365452

The type of the literal &quot;Num a => a&quot; means that the literal &quot;5&quot; works for any type in the Num typeclass. So you can mix literals with any numeric type because the compiler will correctly infer the right type. You can even get usages like this:<p><pre><code>    λ> :t (\x -> x + 5)

There&#x27;s more philosophical/winding essays on Moose from Chromatic, for example at [3].<p>Roles/traits/method modifiers/MOP/composability etc. are all great things for getting more reusability... however (and this might sound stupid) the thing that saddens me most when writing Python code is when I find myself adding a bunch of asserts or adding program logic &quot;manually&quot; in situations where I&#x27;d normally specify that sort of thing declaratively in a Moose class definition or by referring to a centrally managed Type or delegate stuff through attribute features.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;m barely into year 2 of full-time Python dev, so perhaps I&#x27;ve yet to find the idiomatic way of doing Python things I used to take for granted in Moose.<p>Regarding Perl 6, I don&#x27;t know much about it, except that the original authors of Moose had some inspiration from it.<p>Is picking up Perl+Moose mind-expanding? It was for me, but I feel that what Moose gave me in Perl was a bit of a band-aid over the fact that it&#x27;s such a malleable open-ended dynamic language. So as a C++/Java programmer this aspect might not be so enlightening to you, except to see how Moose achieves it in a pretty painless way that I think is very nice and idiomatic for a dynamic language (with the caveats that brings). To put it another way: it gives Perl some of the great benefits of properly declaring things up-front, without the boilerplate/inflexibility pain that I perceive the Java ecosystem&#x27;s bureaucracy to be (I haven&#x27;t touched Java for 10 years, so take that with a grain of salt).<p>If you want to explore some Moose-ish kinds of things within Python, check out [4] (there&#x27;s another Moose clone in Python that&#x27;s similarly inactive, sadly) and [5] (Enthought&#x27;s stuff is perhaps a bit too heavy and incomplete to be the &quot;Moose of the python world&quot;, but it gives you a good idea of some of the nice patterns possible when you think outside of the core Python OO featureset).<p>[1] <a href=""http://search.cpan.org/dist/Moose/lib/Moose/Manual.pod"" rel=""nofollow"">http://search.cpan.org/dist/Moose/lib/Moose/Manual.pod</a>

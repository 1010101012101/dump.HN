But now what?<p>The problem here is that a huge number of talented people almost certainly do work for Yahoo without ever paying attention to the news cycle. Lots of talented people don't have startup ambitions; they bust their ass from 9-5 and come home to their families and their woodworking and charcuterie hobbies. Sure, they probably all have a sense that Yahoo isn't on a great trajectory, but they have no urgent need to leave. Yahoo might even be a better deal for them; pick the wrong startup and you could be hunting for a job again in 6 months.<p>It isn't reasonable to start penalizing people like that for the actions of Yahoo management; or, at least, if it is, it's not reasonable to do it over patent lawsuits. Patent lawsuits aren't a big enough issue to justify collective punishment.<p>I'm a little surprised at the tacit support I read out of this comment.<p>(For what it's worth: I have just as much to fear from patent suits as anyone else; my field is riddled with them).",1331772302

The biggest headache of using it was constantly fighting/maintaining patched cairo/freetype from AUR (because they'd occasionally conflict with a newer version of some other package). And on top of that you'd have a ton of other packages with baked-in broken fonts like Firefox, xulrunner and Open Office.<p>When it comes to fonts and text rendering, all users firmly belong into two groups: the 1st group would post a screenshot of their screen where the 'd' and 'p' are rendered with double line thickness at the tip of their curves, and then claim ""my fonts are fine"". The 2nd group would consider that unusable.<p>What Ubuntu excelled at (and still does) is to bring Linux to the 2nd group of people, which is a lot larger than the 1st one. All Canonical's questionable achievements like Unity, upstart and Bazaar have been easily eclipsed by them noticing and taking care of the elephant in the room: readability of text on user's screen.

And, while I too hate the ""we invented the button and we have a patent"" crowd I also recognize that they exist for a reason.<p>Denying someone employment because the company they work for seeks to enforce their patents --legitimate or not-- is nothing less than being a dick.<p>If you want to do something about frivolous patents get involved politically, seek to understand the issues and push to make sensible changes.  So, how about it Mr. David Sacks instead of being a total dick by seeking to cause damage to Yahoo employees, would you use your money and influence to help change patent laws?<p>I have yet to see any of the loud-mouths spouting off about patents offer to do something like put together a fund to be used in pursuing changes to the laws.  An, of course, none of them will write a check for a few million to fund it.  If I was in a position to get something like this started I would.  Maybe someone can reach vocal anti-patent guys like Mark Cuban and ask him to throw the first ten million into the pot to get this going?<p>With the money available in the top layer of tech companies it should be possible to put together a fund with billions of dollars.  This fund could either be available to fight patent trolls or act as a PAC (or both).<p>Imagine, if you will, what would go through patent troll's minds if they tried to enforce bullshit patents and this group existed.<p>Let's call it the AFSPL (Americans For Sensible Patent Laws).  Furthermore, imagine that this group had massive amounts of money and a whole floor full of lawyers and engineers to throw at the problem.  The ACLU of the patent world, if you will.<p>If someone comes after you with a bullshit patent you could bring it up with the AFSPL for review.  And, if they see it your way they defend you.  Trolls would disappear almost instantly.  Bullshit patents would be invalidated.  The skies would turn blue and the birds would sing.<p>Maybe they could even mount a massive lawsuit against the patent office itself.<p>Don't get me wrong, I firmly believe that there's a place for valid an solid patents, even software patents.  Having said that, I've read through so many patents that have caused me to yell and scream at the top of my lungs ""this is bullshit!"" that it is easy to loose hope.<p>Nah, going after Yahoo employees is crap. Get a grip on reality and put your time, effort and passion behind a real solution.",1331769889

Here is an answer: Dressing down, ubiquitously known as ""being comfortable"", says that you don’t care about how you look, as if your appearance were an entirely private matter that has nothing to do with anyone else. It’s the exact opposite: what you wear is part of the visible environment, as relevant as the architecture, the decor, the food on the table, the scents in the air. <a href=""http://betweenmypeers.com/2007/09/20/why-dress-up-for-social-occasions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://betweenmypeers.com/2007/09/20/why-dress-up-for-social...</a>",1331769799

Other people's copying activities do nothing to diminish your ability to enjoy the direct utility value of the book itself - copying can <i>only</i> diminish the potential return available to you from selling your book to others, but you never had a positive right to a market return in the first place.<p>The argument you're making requires that there's <i>already</i> some legal mechanism by which you can restrain others from copying your work.

MyClass is a subtype of {MyClass + 3bits}, if you like, since it doesn&#x27;t hurt to mask out zero bits. This is all at compile time, and I suppose all erased types must be {Object + 3bits} now for safety.

I think half, or at least 25%, of a fundraiser tangential to a project should go back to the project itself. If something is valuable enough to audit, it should be valuable enough to pay for. It seems like a massive slap in the face to developers to directly compete with them in the donations pool in such a way.<p>* As far as I can tell, the audit project began without the consent of the Truecrypt developers. You can argue that this is necessary for some security reason, but it is also a rude gesture to an open-source project.<p>* The crowdfunding drive contained no provisions for handling the results of the audit such as developer resources, etc.. The existing developers were assumed to be both capable and motivated to drop whatever they were spending <i>their free time</i> working on to fix things that auditors found.<p>* The atmosphere around the audit push from the beginning seemed very negative. There was a distinct &quot;Truecrypt is super sketchy&quot; vibe in the HN comments, etc., surrounding it initially. I think that this was a good thing for the audit, which meant helping the audit directly hurt the Truecrypt brand. This dovetails with...<p>* Singling out Truecrypt as the target of an extensive, expensive audit seems somewhat absurd. There are several projects that could have benefited much more from an audit that weren&#x27;t audited, such as OpenSSL, Linux&#x27;s RNG, OpenVPN, any other TLS implementation, Tor, maybe TextSecure (though I don&#x27;t know if TextSecure had enough of a userbase at the time to justify it, it certainly does now). Why were these projects <i>not</i> audited? I think it&#x27;s because the Truecrypt devs tried to be anonymous, and low-profile, whereas these other projects are all backed by people with faces who are much harder to throw something at than Truecrypt was.<p>istruecryptauditedyet.com is a real page now, but what was it before? A giant NO on the screen? Is there an &#x27;istextsecureauditedyet.com&#x27; even though TS uses novel protocols and crypto? Why not?<p>So, I think:<p>* The fundraiser should have supported Truecrypt while raising money for an audit<p>* The fundraiser should have incorporated costs to fix anything found as a result of an audit, with money going back to Truecrypt if nothing substantial was found<p>* The audit push should have been conducted with the consent, or better yet, solicitation, from Truecrypt developers<p>* The audit should have been conducted in a more respectful way, emphasizing the positive gain from auditing specifically Truecrypt rather than the negative aspects of Truecrypt&#x27;s existing development style<p>In general, open source is a massive donation of time and effort and should be treated like the gift that it is instead of being taken for granted. I think that people took Truecrypt for granted and that&#x27;s probably a part of the reason why its developer quit, because that is a very common reason for open-source developers to quit and I find it impossible to believe that it was not at all a factor in their quitting.<p>If you would truly feel happy if your project was shit on, donations effectively stolen from you, and a ton of work dumped on you that you did not ask for, but now must immediately address lest you be attacked for &quot;ignoring the results of the audit,&quot; you are a special type of human to say the least.",1428349796

My apologies in advance for rambling.<p>You can use doc comments to signify types. You mention you use PyCharm in your article, and it supports doc comments in it&#x27;s autocomplete and code analysis, I find most popular libraries are commented well enough that PyCharm can understand them.<p>I also always try (and encourage others) to use names that are declarative for both purpose and type. Of course, you can&#x27;t always rely on third party libraries (or even colleagues) to be so nice, but I find a good name (almost) always removes all the confusion that normally comes from a lack of static typing.<p>For example, one of Codecademy&#x27;s very first Python lessons includes some code like this:<p><pre><code>    meal = 44.50\n    tax = 0.0675\n    tip = 0.15\n</code></pre>\nWhich I think is unclear. Imagine these were function arguments. calc_total(meal, tax, tip) is vague. Is meal an object, or a numeric value? (I could possibly see it containing a list of all items in the meal with prices). Tax is almost always a percentage, but what about tip? Judging by the the above values, we can assume a 15% tip, but we don&#x27;t know if the customer was stingy and tipped $0.15, and by just name alone, we can&#x27;t tell at all.<p><pre><code>    calc_total(meal_cost, tax_percent, tip_percent)\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s now immediately clear to me the type and range of values it accepts. The tip_percent is also an example of when a good name can provide info that even static typing could not, because in either case it is a floating point (please let&#x27;s not get into a debate about Decimal or currency types :P ). This is a very basic example, but it applies at all levels. Don&#x27;t call the parameter &quot;users&quot; if the function is not expecting an iterable of User objects. Maybe &quot;usernames&quot; would be better. Etc.<p>But of course, this only helps if the code you&#x27;re working with is named well. In something like Java, you have better protection and tools when working alongside lower quality code. I also completely agree with you on point #2 about No Static Types. Navigating through my editor is so much easier in a static language than it is in PyCharm with large projects. And the most annoying thing is that autocomplete breaks with ORMs, and most ORM usage is actually flagged as a warning or error. Ugh.<p>I also feel very confident in the automated refactoring in something such as an IntelliJ Java project, or ReSharper, but am apprehensive about using PyCharm to refactor anything with usages spanning more than one file. Same goes for Javascript (or any other dynamic language, I suppose. Those are just the two I use).<p>Enjoyed the posts by the way, adding your blog to my reading list.",1428349709

It should not be long before they ask about pricing and availability. That&#x27;s when you simply say you think it will be ready by date X.<p>Take for example the email assistant AI startup X.ai.

Here&#x27;s an amusing attempt to do so using her own format:<p>> <i>&quot;What is the moral code of egocentrism? The basic principle of egocentrism is that other people have no right to exist other than for your sake, that service to you is the only justification of their existence, and that their sacrifice for your good is their highest moral duty, virtue and value.</i><p>> <i>Do not confuse egocentrism with self-respect, self-awareness or respect for your rights. These are not primaries, but consequences, which, in fact, egocentrism makes impossible. The irreducible primary of egocentrism, the basic absolute, is the total unimportance of the other—which means; not caring one whit about others, using them for your own means, sacrificing their feelings and even their lives if necessary—which means: the other as a standard of evil, the self as a standard of the good.</i><p>> <i>Do not hide behind such superficialities as whether you should or should not use people. That is not the issue. The issue is whether those people have the right to exist without being of use to you. The issue is whether you are really compelled to notionally support the existence, day by day, of people who are of no apparent use to you. The issue is whether your needs are the first mortgage on their life and the moral purpose of their existence. The issue is whether other people are to be regarded as sacrificial animals. Any man worth calling that will answer: “No.” Egocentrism says: “Yes.”&quot;</i><p>As usual, the better place to sit is somewhere in the middle. No, you do not exist just to serve others, and total self-abnegation and sacrifice is certainly not a productive way to live. Neither, however, is total self-adoration and worship of your ego.

At the end of the day, both projects and the communities behind them want people to be successful with containers.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/pull/5518"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/pull/5518</a>",1428348784

It is not a matter of diversifying risk allowing one product to fail while another product succeeds. It&#x27;s a matter of amplifying risk.<p>Starting a single product is very hard. It takes a whole lot of effort, time, energy, and finance to get a product off the ground and viable. By adding a second unrelated product into the mix you are multiplying those tasks. Let&#x27;s imagine the scenario where the financial services app is doing well in the app store and the social networking website is struggling. The logically thing would be to cut the social network loose and focus on the financial services app. Unfortunately, a co-founder generally won&#x27;t do that. They will pull the profits from the financial services app and use that to try to save the social networking website. This removes resources from the successful application and pushes them towards the unsuccessful. This probably won&#x27;t solve the social networks problems, and it will probably cause problems for the financial services app. In the end, both will fail.<p>Some would say you can build a successful business with related product offerings that are different but complementary. This can be true. It would be like a car company that also owns a finance arm, an insurance arm, and a maintenance arm. All are different but complementary. However, again there is a substantial amount of risk in this and you would have to be well established for an investor the believe you have what it takes to make a business ecosystem like this succeed.<p>At any rate, I would suggest picking a product and sticking to it.

The magic stopped, ergo software is crap.<p>The document then goes on to attempt to define a process for developing software.  What is lists is a bit laughable:<p>1. Planning: Produce a plan to do the work.\n2. Development: Perform the work.\na. Define the requirements (see 4.2.2)\nb. Design the program\nc. Review the design and fix all defects\nd. Code the program\ne. Review the code and fix all defects\nf. Build or compile and fix all defects\ng. Test the program and fix all defects\n3. Postmortem.<p>Anyone who&#x27;s ever done software development, will tell you that the order for these is something like:<p>2b, 2a, 2b, 2d, 2c, oh - someone&#x27;s asking for sizings, better do some 1 - 2d, 2c, 2d, 2b, 2a, 2d...<p>Trying to develop software in a process-oriented fashion is doomed to failure, because developing software is the act of <i>creating</i> <i>processes</i> for a computer to execute.  If it were possible to define a software development process, we could get someone to write it up in C, or Python, or whatever, and then just kick back and let the computer do the development for us!  Heck, if we take the extra time to code in PV and EV calculations, it&#x27;ll have a working progress bar too!<p>[|||||||||||||__________]  Coding... (50%)<p>That being said, these elements of the &quot;process&quot; are useful as a taxonomy for the kinds of activities that must be performed as part of software development, and if you fail to do any of them, you will likely produce inferior quality software.  But listing them in a regimented fashion, or trying to follow them as a &quot;process&quot;, simply does not work.<p>But in the end there&#x27;s an awful lot of waffle in what amounts to a pretty impenetrable document.  There&#x27;s got to be a better way to codify what we <i>actually</i> do when we develop good software.  Not what we think we do, or wish we did, or claim we do to sound impressive.<p>Edit: grammar.",1428348225

I seem to recall the Parse team fixing these, and then repeatedly rolling back their fixes since they would inevitably cause something even more catastrophic to happen. I am sure all of them were working really hard, and I don&#x27;t want to say anything to make them feel bad, but honestly, the class of problems that plagued Parse (at least at the time I was familiar with it) did not inspire confidence.

Write simple code first. To the heap allocation example:<p><pre><code>    auto x = std::make_unique<int>(5);\n</code></pre>\nEven if this is a silly example, just say no to unnecessary heap allocation. Why not:<p><pre><code>    int x{5};\n</code></pre>\nNow to the lifted example:<p><pre><code>    void add_one(std::unique_ptr<int> num) {\n        * num += 1;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis mixes operations with lifetime management. The add_one function does not need to care about ownership. And it does not need to take ownership of its argument. Instead on the call site do:<p><pre><code>    int add_one(int); // from above\n\n    auto p = make_unique(5);\n    auto six = add_one(*p); // <-\n</code></pre>\nThere are valid points in the blog post and I know that most snippets are meant as examples.

The basic principle of altruism is that man has no right to exist for his own sake, that service to others is the only justification of his existence, and that self-sacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue and value.<p>Do not confuse altruism with kindness, good will or respect for the rights of others. These are not primaries, but consequences, which, in fact, altruism makes impossible. The irreducible primary of altruism, the basic absolute, is self-sacrifice—which means; self-immolation, self-abnegation, self-denial, self-destruction—which means: the self as a standard of evil, the selfless as a standard of the good.<p>Do not hide behind such superficialities as whether you should or should not give a dime to a beggar. That is not the issue. The issue is whether you do or do not have the right to exist without giving him that dime. The issue is whether you must keep buying your life, dime by dime, from any beggar who might choose to approach you. The issue is whether the need of others is the first mortgage on your life and the moral purpose of your existence. The issue is whether man is to be regarded as a sacrificial animal.

9330049,comment,9329259,9329259,0,0,wyc,,,"> we set out to build and deliver Google’s infrastructure to everyone else<p>This statement rings pretty true as Kubernetes (also known as k8s) has some Google biases. Not all cloud providers will have such an easy time providing all the infrastructure necessary to run CoreOS + k8s smoothly.<p>For example, Kubernetes assigns each Pod (k8s unit of computation) an IP address, which is only simple to do if your cloud provider supplies something like a /24 private block to your nodes. CoreOS came up with the VXLAN-based Flannel project to make this model more portable[0], but Layer 2 over Layer 3 isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d like to throw haphazardly into my production environments. Google Compute Engine conveniently provides this setup as an option.<p>Another example of Google-favoritism is the strong preference of centralized storage--particularly GCEPersistentDisk. At first I was concerned about centralized storage by default as we know disk locality is a Good Thing (TM), but after reading a paper that claimed networking is improving faster than disks are[2], I felt somewhat better about this. However, it&#x27;s still pretty obvious that a Google Persistent Disk is the way to go with k8s[3].<p>That said, I&#x27;m really happy that Google has open-sourced this project because it is indeed a functioning, tested, and easy-to-use distributed system. I&#x27;m sure that the devs aren&#x27;t aggressively shutting out other cloud providers and that these biases are probably just a side-effect of their resource allocation process and the problems that they intend to solve (e.g. GCEPersistentDisk used to be a core type instead of a module--it has since gotten better). It&#x27;s still important to evaluate a technology&#x27;s biases and potential evolution before throwing your product on it.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/coreos/flannel"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/coreos/flannel</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/volumes.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/maste...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ganesha/disk-irrelevant_hotos2011.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ganesha/disk-irrelevant_hotos2...</a><p>[3] Do you see any other providers here? <a href=""https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/tree/master/pkg/volume"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/tree/maste...</a>",1428347356

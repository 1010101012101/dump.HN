Writing blog posts, writing stories, writing emails, all share the same principle: use only the words necessary to convey the message.<p>Just because story-writing has a lot more description does not mean that those words aren&#x27;t necessary. For example, for Hamlet to simply say &quot;I am conflicted about my current situation and am contemplating suicide&quot;, does not nearly give the same nuance or insight into what his thought process is as &quot;To be, or not to be, that is the question:/Whether &#x27;tis Nobler in the mind to suffer/The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune,/Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,/And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep&quot;.<p>tl;dr the goal of most forms of writing is to convey a message with just the right amount of words",1380650350

Crew or Gap or above).<p>It&#x27;s actually interesting though, at the mid-to-low end similar disruption is happening in a different way. There are &#x27;designer&#x27; brands that exist at these price points, but they are being disrupted by the department stores that previously purchased them shifting to private label production (brands the stores produce themselves and label with their own brand), and shifting fast. In 1970, 25% of department store retail was private-label brands, in 2005, 50%, in 2010, 60%.

6477862,comment,6476836,6477131,3,0,steamer25,,,"Using the available lane-age/real-estate to attempt negotiating a merge at speed and minimize the problems caused by inertia is a good thing. This works in at least two ways:\n1) The backup is less likely to extend past an off-ramp as pointed out.\n2) Human-nature. If everyone in the backed up lane were paying attention and trying to get off the road as soon as possible, this benefit wouldn&#x27;t exist. However, some people use the opportunity afforded by the congestion to check their email or a map or adjust their hair/makeup or turn around to yell at the kids or just day-dream. When the car in front of them moves, it takes them several seconds to snap out of whatever is distracting them. In these cases, it&#x27;s possible to slip in front of them without adding to the number of inert vehicles.<p>This is true of unstopped vehicles as well. Not everyone is comfortable driving at the maximum safe speed. In fact, where I live, fines are enforced on all state roads from 6 to 13 MPH below engineering guidelines. Even so, many people choose to travel even slower than allowed by graceless statute. While these patient souls approach the bottleneck, several of the swift may de-queue themselves to the benefit of everyone who would otherwise wait behind them.<p>Oftentimes, the road hasn&#x27;t actually reached saturation--it&#x27;s just a compound case of live-lock and if people use the full measure of available lanes (instead of stopping at the first sign that says &quot;Road Work Five Miles Ahead&quot;), they have a greater opportunity of resolving the contention without promoting a cascaded slow down.<p>Of course, all of this is an edge-case. As the OP alludes, when the road is actually saturated, the real solution involves either decreasing demand for or increasing the supply of throughput at the chokepoint. Mere bickering and maneuvering will not avail anyone.",1380650231
6477861,comment,6476836,6477336,5,0,cwoods,,,"Agree 100%.<p>From the article:<p>>Suppose youre on a 2-lane (each way) highway and one lane is closed up ahead due to construction. Now the flow rate of your lane is cut in half (or there are twice as many cars in line in front of you, depending on how you want to look at it).<p>What I observe is that the speed is reduced to one twentieth of the speed, not just half. This is because people are merging very slowly while jostling resulting in needless braking. If everyone could agree upon a proper zipper merge, the speed for everyone would go up many times.<p>Or imagine a traffic signal at the merge point that only lets one lane go through for a minute each. The overall flow rate would be much higher than what it is without such a signal.<p>Discounting this based on theoretical flow rate (as if removing one lane reduces real traffic flow by only 50%) shows that the author totally ignores real traffic scenarios completely at odds with the title of the article.",1380650229

My point is that a line on an exit ramp which reaches back onto the highway will <i>cause</i> additional traffic for everyone on the highway. Since his model doesn&#x27;t take traffic-causing-traffic into account, he never reaches my conclusion.<p>Exit lines are particularly costly because adjacent lanes of traffic generally only sustain a 10MPH difference in speed. Once the right lane is stopped, a 4 lane highway has a maximum safe speed of 30MPH in the left hand lane. This reduces the flow capacity of the highway and may cause the left lane to lock up because left lane drivers get frustrated at slow speeds and are the more likely to tailgate and cause traffic waves.<p>His model also is only concerned with the self: &quot;can I reach my goal any faster&quot;, and he reaches the mostly correct conclusion that he basically cannot (even though avoiding traffic waves by driving in the rightmost non-exit lane would help him significantly). He does not appear to value his contribution to the delay of the people behind him, which is where all the really interesting conclusions are found, including the reason why traffic wave busting is beneficial.",1380650048

A typical engineering text focused on signal processing will develop an analysis method and then show example applications to audio, to images, to bridge resonance, to electronic circuits, etc. Things do get more specific as you dig further into domain-specific features and heuristics, but there&#x27;s a large common foundation.<p>The usefulness of the kinds of experiments in this post, imo, is to investigate whether some things developed as domain-specific features actually belong more in the common foundation part. Sometimes something will be developed initially in computer-music or computer-vision not because it&#x27;s really music or vision specific, but just due to where a particular person happened to be working. Or where research funding was allocated, for that matter. A funding trick computer-music people like doing lately is to apply their algorithms to bioinformatics as a way of funding research in their real domain of interest.<p>The next step, of course, would be to try to determine if these image-processing techniques <i>already do</i> exist in audio processing, just under a different name, or in some kind of variant.",1380649529

Once the two trucks near the point of obstruction, the &quot;open&quot; driver is happy to let the &quot;closed&quot; one merge in, and there is no merging at the point of obstruction, which is both a safety and traffic-flow win.<p>I contend that the two truckers have done more to speed <i>actual</i> traffic flow (i.e. from a point <i>before</i> the obstacle to a point <i>after</i> it) than any number of assholes have. While at the beginning of the maneuver there is a solid line of fuming assholes behind the &quot;closed&quot; truck, by the time the obstacle has been reached all fuming asshole traffic has completely merged behind the &quot;open&quot; truck. Since it is only merging <i>at</i> the point of obstruction that slows traffic more than the obstruction itself already has, this is a net win.<p>Of course this maneuver must be repeated by successive pairs of truckers, and occasionally an asshole will &quot;win&quot; by racing forward between pairs, but that&#x27;s minor.",1380648061

There&#x27;s no way to specify the type of keyword you&#x27;re searching for, so if it&#x27;s an author, you&#x27;ll probably have to wade through a sea of wildly irrelevant results to find that maybe they don&#x27;t even have anything from that author.<p>I grabbed two different versions of Mary Shelly&#x27;s Frankenstein, both of which the website proudly stated were included in my subscription. Neither was a truely optimized ebook. More like PDF images, so the text or pages didn&#x27;t scale.<p>The reading experience on the app is sub par. No options for font type, size, or color; no background options; or margin options. No &quot;night mode&quot; or similar.<p>There&#x27;s also often not an indication that a book is just a preview on the website. I added Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s Child of God to my library, and the app told me that it wasn&#x27;t available in my country (US), but I could read it on the website, but I discovered it was a preview only.<p>Related to that, when searching on the website, it seems to prioritize purchase-only books over subscription books. I understand the why, but it&#x27;s really frustrating to have to start scrolling to get to what most people will be looking for.<p>Then there&#x27;s the trouble with having to wade through the sea of user-uploaded content. It seems like there should either be a separate app for the subscription portion, or at least a way to search ONLY that.<p>All in all, I really wish this was something I could see myself paying for, but right now, I think it&#x27;s kind of a mess.",1380647069

6477449,comment,6477137,6477137,5,0,VLM,,,"One hidden assumption is the high growth of internet retail implies a high growth of fashion clothing growth.  Not sure why that applies.  Sounds good, just not backed up by numbers.<p>Its hard to think of a commodity with more of a conspicuous consumption purpose than expensive fashion clothes, other than perhaps cars.  The act of shopping for them, being seen shopping for them, the whole trying them on and looking a mirror, seems to reach or exceed the enjoyment of eventually wearing them in public.<p>I would imagine sizing is a complicated issue impacting possible 10% annual growth rates and all that.  Tee shirt sizes are simple so online tee shirt sellers do well.  I have bought my last four pairs of shoes on line because they&#x27;re identical mfgr, model, size, width.  I&#x27;m thinking high fashion clothing sizing might be somewhat more complicated.  &quot;do these stripes make my butt look fat&quot; is hard to answer if you don&#x27;t try the clothing on.  As if thats ever an easy question to answer.<p>Finally you can increase annual sales of $300 fashion brand jeans by 10% per year for quite a few years, but eventually you bounce off declining median adjusted incomes, permanent decrease in economic activity, long term demographic decline stuff like that.  It is very much like growing the 50+ foot sailing yacht market by 10% per year, you can do that for awhile, but eventually you run out of people capable of paying $300 for a pair of jeans, err, buying 50+ foot sailing yachts...  The fashion market may not be big enough to make the subset of internet sales large enough to be viable.  Perhaps walmart has more to fear from amazon than the major fashion brands... there&#x27;s a lot more people buying $25 walmart jeans wanting to save $5 at amazon than people buying $300 jeans hoping to save $200.<p>(edited to add that if you agree with the assumptions of the article, its a well written and well analyzed article with no obvious mistakes.  I just happen to disagree with several core assumptions which has quite an effect on my opinion of the conclusion.)",1380647049

Where is that extra space going to come from? You cannot keep 2 seconds back from the car that has just merged in front of you without, um, slowing down. If the car in front of you is also slowing down for the same reason, you have to slow down even more. This is basically the definition of a traffic jam.&quot;<p>However, if you have two lanes, with one lane blocked, then wouldn&#x27;t not allowing for another car to safely merge into your lane prevent them from merging? Then you have one lane moving quite fast, but the other lane would be going more slowly...<p>Like I say, there may be something I&#x27;m missing here, I&#x27;m happy to be enlightened!",1380647029

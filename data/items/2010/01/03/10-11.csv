E.g. if they know the money is going to help starving kids (or whatever charity) and they give for that reason, then it makes sense to count tithes (or a percent of tithes?).  If they would give tithes no matter what because they are supposed to, then it probably doesn't make sense to count them (at least if you are trying to analyze who is the most giving based on money spent or percentage of income, whatever).",1262516354

I settled on:<p><a href=""http://jscc.jmksf.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jscc.jmksf.com/</a><p>And started writing a small Lisp programming language this morning. I like this Jison grammar syntax a lot better so I think I'll have to start porting it.<p>Thanks for posting this!",1262516106

They give full access to the personal info of a person given their email address. Their new 'privacy' terms is basically about nobody having any privacy.<p>Small and agile business like mine will capitalise quickly on this info, but sooner or later, big companies like coca-cola will also see nothing wrong with storing public information that a user has 'chosen' to make public.",1262515848

It's a good thing status starts depending on other things (expertise, success) later.<p>When it comes helping a kid fake 'coolness' I think there's merit. There ARE real advantages to not being pigeon holed as a nerd and getting a head start on those social skills.",1262515485

I finally got around to building a site that allows you to browse information on Movies and Actors in a manner similar to that of the original.<p>It certainly is not as refined as my original inspiration, but, it is a starting  point for me. I hope you like it and find it useful when you need information on an Actor or Movie.<p>Also, if  you are interested in adding/updating the Movie/Actor info, please let me know here. I will e-mail you the admin access details.<p>Thanks,\nK7.",1262515011

1028407,comment,1027780,1028065,0,0,nailer,,,"There's some technical inaccuracies too - eg, FreeBSD has ACLs, implying that Linux doesn't in Linux-based OSs. RHEL/CentOS and Fedora have had ACLs by default for years now and they're easily enabled on Ubuntu/Debian if you need them.<p>'Since both the kernel and the provided utilities are under the control of the same release engineering team, there is less likelihood of library incompatibilities. ' is just as true of Linux OSs too.",1262513850

The question asked for &quot;5 x 3&quot; using repeated addition. The x is a very well defined mathematical operator and &quot;repeated addition&quot; has a very well-defined meaning, and the child has demonstrated it by repeatedly adding 5 three times.<p>Yes, the child&#x27;s cardinal sin is he Did Not Do As He Was Taught(tm), but seriously, that&#x27;s more the teacher&#x27;s and the school board&#x27;s problem in my book, not the child&#x27;s.",1446307183

10483050,comment,10482678,10482678,0,0,chris_wot,,,"There are a number of issues with this explanation.<p>Firstly, as we know, multiplication and addition are associative, which means if you ever teach a child that 5 x 3 is different to 3 x 5, you are imparting wrong information.<p>The issue is that the question asks the child to &quot;use the repeated addition strategy to solve: 5x3&quot;. The reason this is a problem is because &quot;repeated addition&quot; is indeed a <i>strategy</i> to teach children the concept that if you take a multiple of some number the. It is like repeatedly adding that number of items, a number of times. It is used as a stepping stone towards fully understanding multiplication,after on, and takes into account that young children think I terms of what they see. So for example, they see that a dog has 4 legs, and if you have 3 dogs then you add the four legs together three times (one for each dog).<p>Notice that it&#x27;s madness to teach this as a. &quot;addition strategy&quot;, because at that age &quot;strategy&quot; is far too abstract a concept for most children to grasp. The irony is that teachers then attempt to teach using a technique that uses a low level of abstraction, but when they call it the &quot;addition strategy&quot; they have just attempted to teach this technique that is using a more concrete methodology via language that uses concepts that are arguably more abstract than the concept they are attempting to teach!<p>You can see that the whole point of that technique is missed completely on that exam <i>because</i> of the question being asked. In fact, to have a student demonstrate understanding the I fact the question should be &quot;I have five jars of Jellybeans. Each jar has 3 Jellybeans in them. Show me how you would represent the number of jars times by the number of Jellybeans in each jar, using addition.&quot;<p>You see, the point of the strategy is entirely being missed here. The author protests that the child will get confused because if they rely on the law of association with subtraction and division they will get the answer wrong, and be confused. But that&#x27;s not what is happening. The child has clearly understood that actually, 3+3+3+3+3 is the same as 5+5+5. In actual fact, the student has shown a <i>clear</i> understanding of multiplication via addition.<p>If you think that child will be confused, wait till they get to fractions and numbers with decimal places! Because at that point, you can&#x27;t use addition to explain multiplication and then you need to explain multiplication in terms of <i>scale</i>. There&#x27;s actually a case to answer that the entire technique of teaching multiplication via addition is fundamentally flawed and it&#x27;s better to teach in terms of scale anyway. I don&#x27;t subscribe to that view, but I can see why it might be held.<p>I have to also take issue with using the definition from what looks like the Cambridge Dictionary&#x27;s noun definition is that this is NOT the same precise meaning as equivalence in mathematics. In fact, if you were to use first-order logic, then it would be:<p>iff 5x3=15 then 5+5+5=15<p>or,<p>(5x3=15) ≡ (5+5+5=15)<p>That satisfies the two expressions logical equivalence. So the statement that this is NOT logically equivalent is entirely wrong.<p>Furthermore, the author has not read the definition on Wikipedia carefully enough. It says:<p><i>The multiplication of two whole numbers is equivalent to adding as many copies of one of them, as the value of the other one</i><p>The assumption being made here is that Wikipedia is saying that the number that is to be added up multiple times is the leftmost number in the expression, but it does <i>not</i> in fact say this at all. It says to add &quot;as many copies of <i>one of them</i>&quot;, which means it could be referring to the left <i>or</i> right hand value in the multiplication expression.<p>The common core and the techniques used to teach young children are solid. Unfortunately, it looks like the way they have been used and taught to <i>educators</i> is the problem here! The fact that you can see the framework leaking into a test question shows that there is a fundamental flaw in the pedagogy of whoever is teaching that class.",1446307084

The destination is totally possible. The path will determine whether you are able to get there or not.<p>Write down 5 of your best ideas on paper or wherever. Then leave it for a few days. If you think of a new idea someday, go back to that old list and check if that idea was already something you wrote before. Give it an extra point. Rinse and repeat until you realize that you keep coming back to one idea more than others. Pick that one. Of course, you could already believe strongly in an idea and then you don&#x27;t ned to do all this.<p>Next step is to build a prototype of this idea. If you can build a web app yourself, then do it using the language/framework you are comfortable with. DO NOT think about whether this is the right language/framework. IT DOES NOT MATTER AT THIS TIME. Heck, use Wordpress to patch a bare minimum working prototype if you really need to. But you need to get something out there. Something that is not in your head but something concrete. It does not have to be pretty or slick. Trust me.

I don&#x27;t know how to tell you every possible way to achieve this as this is where the real challenge is.<p>Once you get decent enough traction, then you can choose to quit your job if you can afford to do that. Save, save save. If you want to have another partner/help, think about getting that person on board. Or may be you want to remain solo. that is fine for the type of business you asked about.<p>Then you know what comes next ?Just fuckin quit your job!! I did that. Yes, you can do that. There will NEVER be a right time to do it. If you are ready, you are ready. Otherwise you are never ready. Don&#x27;t think about what you will lose by quitting your job.

There&#x27;s zero incentive for the hacker to return the victim&#x27;s data.<p>This becomes a probablistic situation: the approach I&#x27;d take if I were a victim would be to borrow an analogy from poker for the problem of deciding whether to call in order to possibly win a pot. First, I&#x27;d determine how much the data is worth to me, and use that to determine my &quot;pot odds&quot;:<p><pre><code>    pot_odds = ransom / value_of_data\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;d then try to figure out how often hackers actually return the data on a ransom:<p><pre><code>    odds_of_data_being_returned ~= times_data_has_been_returned_after_ransom_paid / times_ransom_has_been_paid\n</code></pre>\nAt this point, we can decide whether it&#x27;s a rational choice to pay the ransom:<p><pre><code>    if pot_odds < odds_of_data_being_returned:\n        pay_the_ransom()\n</code></pre>\nAreas for research: this is a pretty unsophisticated way of determining the odds of the data being returned. I don&#x27;t have data on how often hackers return data upon being paid the ransom, but I suspect if we gathered data we could get a better probability. For example, one could use linguistic patterns in the hacker&#x27;s communication to fingerprint different ransomware hackers, and use that to get a probability for each individual hacker. It&#x27;s likely that some hackers never return the data, and some hackers always return the data, and each of these probabilities has drastically different effects on the outcome of our decision algorithm.",1446306738

I don&#x27;t even know where to start.<p><i>It’s more important than ever for students to understand the difference between equal as a result and equivalence in meaning from a young age because it is a fundamental computer science concept (...) Equivalent means not only are they equal, they are also of the same data type. In other words, they mean the same thing.</i><p>Except that this point is totally misguided because 5+5+5 and 3+3+3+3+3 <i>are</i>, in fact, the same thing. A member of the set of natural numbers, commonly known as 15, and that you can write as S(S(S(S(S(S(S(S(S(S(S(S(S(S(S(0))))))))))))))) if you have the patience to do so.<p>In fact, the author uses the == and === operators in JavaScript to illustrate his point, but of course, 5+5+5 === 3+3+3+3+3 resolves to true in Javascript, and in any language under the sun that compares stuff by value.<p>And then, if you compare by reference, the result of == or similar operators doesn&#x27;t depend at all on whether you made your integer by adding up three fives or five threes: in Java,<p><pre><code>  Integer i1 = new Integer(5+5+5);\n  Integer i2 = new Integer(3+3+3+3+3);\n  Integer i3 = new Integer(3+3+3+3+3);\n  System.out.println(i1==i2 + &quot; and &quot; + i2==i3);\n</code></pre>\nprints false and false, while using equals instead of == would print true and true.<p>So I don&#x27;t see how this nonsense would teach kids anything useful about computer science. The only thing it can do is confuse them.<p><i>equivalent is defined as, “equal in value, amount, function, or meaning.”\nIn the above problem 5 x 3 is equal to 5 + 5 + 5, but they’re not necessarily equivalent. Equivalence relates to meaning, so it depends on the meaning of multiplication, as the directions indicate.</i><p>First of all, the sign in the exam statement is an equal sign, not an equivalence sign. So if 15 is equal to 5x3, what the student wrote is perfectly fine. Also, &quot;solving&quot; a multiplication means finding out its value, which is what he did.<p>Secondly, you know what also is a fundamental computer science concept? The logical operation &quot;or&quot;. The definition of &quot;equivalent&quot; in the blog is reported as “equal in value, amount, function, or meaning.” &quot;Or&quot;, not &quot;and&quot;. So the definition doesn&#x27;t say anything about equality in meaning (however you define it) being a necessary condition for equivalence.<p>Maybe teachers are &quot;experts on child education&quot; but that doesn&#x27;t exempt them from knowing something about maths if they are supposed to teach them.",1446306272

People seem to project so much stuff on to what&#x27;s actually shown on the paper that the arguments don&#x27;t even make sense a lot of the time - either way. Some things I can get only looking at the paper:<p>The student got a grade of 4/6. There is no evidence from what can be seen on the photo if there are more than two questions or not - however it appears that after #2 there are instructions about showing work, etc. So it&#x27;s entirely within reason to think that there were only two questions, yet many many people seem to accuse the teacher of being awful for not assigning partial credit. The evidence present on the page is not enough to conclude either way - there are solid arguments and inferences in each direction, yet everyone seems to argue from a &quot;the answer was all right&quot; or &quot;the answer was all wrong&quot; perspective.<p>Similarly - everyone is focusing just on the &quot;learning to multiply whole numbers&quot; aspect of this. But I presume this assignment was given in the course of a broader teaching curriculum. Perhaps the goal is to get the kids to arrange things in a certain way, because it provides a bit of foundational knowledge for next steps. Some next steps where pushing the &quot;3+3+3+3+3&quot; version of this is a &quot;better&quot; representation:<p>* algebraic concepts: 2x becomes x+x, etc. I don&#x27;t know a way to write 2x in terms of 2+...<p>* fractions: (this is basically the same as above) 4 * 1/2 is 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2, but again I don&#x27;t know how to write it in terms of 4+ without requiring a bigger transform of first doing the multiplication then switching the sign.<p>* Matricies - here is a case of multiplication that isn&#x27;t commutative<p>Point being - when teaching sometimes things are left out at first, for the sake of a simple consistent framework to built more concepts upon. Later - those concepts can help to understand additional properties or adjustments to the original facts. It&#x27;s not required to teach the rules of commutative and associative and so on immediately.<p>Another funny thing about this is everyone just assumes that the paper as shown represents the totality of output from the teacher. It&#x27;s entirely possible that after the quiz or assignment, the teacher gave a lesson on why this (perhaps common) &#x27;mistake&#x27; is wrong.<p>I guess I&#x27;m rambling off my original point - but I don&#x27;t really understand how this entire thing is causing so much vitriol and hate and unfounded speculation - other than a bunch of people projecting their own frustrations with some shitty teachers they had in the past.",1446306089

You definitely have to be bright to make money trading; there is a baseline and it&#x27;s pretty high. Beyond that, the most valuable things are attention to detail, working well under uncertainty where the best answer isn&#x27;t obvious or even knowable, and simple hard work.<p>Aside from systematic errors like Knight, market-makers rarely blow up due to competition or a bad model, they just fade away. They make or lose money pretty slowly, they just do it consistently over time.<p>Aside from the most basic strategies there isn&#x27;t one &quot;right&quot; way to price a market. It&#x27;s an engineering problem like any other. How much risk do I accumulate? How should I manage this risk? How far apart should I set my bid and offer? Do I use a simplistic model with lower latency or a more complex one that&#x27;s slower? Is it better to be more accurate and avoid bad trades or less accurate and build up priority in the order book by staying on a price longer?<p>A market-maker&#x27;s objective function is to maximize total profit (turnover * average gain/$ traded) while controlling risk (volatility of P&L over time). Usually changing your answer to questions like the ones above will shift turnover one way and profit per trade & risk in the opposite direction. For example, if you quote your bid and offer very close together, you&#x27;ll trade large market share and have less risk exposure since you get in and out of positions very quickly, but your profit per trade will be low (if traders arrive randomly, at best you will make the small spread between your bid and offer, in reality a fraction of that since they usually have a reason to trade against you). If you set your quotes wider, you&#x27;ll make more per trade on large dislocations, but do less volume and hold more risk.<p>There are a lot of efficient points along this continuum and traders play to their strengths. Someone with little capital/risk tolerance, top-tier infrastructure, and forecasting models for the next price tick should play very differently than someone with a lot of capital, average infrastructure, and models that can forecast the next 10 minutes.<p>And you are right regarding bonuses, but all team efforts have this problem. Who creates value and deserves the best compensation in a SaSS startup? Is it the salespeople who get clients? The engineers who build the software? The Ops team that keeps it running reliably? I actually find trading to be a bit more meritocratic than other tech jobs: either you make money or you don&#x27;t, and teams are smaller so it&#x27;s easier to assign reward (or blame).",1446305997

In the event the attacker does learn the custom protocol that is clearly a liability. But claiming the protocol itself as a secret is worse than that.

TLS + independent Secure Remote Password is more secure than TLS + secret alterations.

Even if the problem states &quot;Use the repeated addition strategy&quot;. The author mentions it&#x27;s <i>crucial</i> to understand this but I don&#x27;t believe important enough to discourage a young student this way.

His way was faster &quot;I can use multiplication strategies to help me multiply.&quot;  Seems the student&#x27;s strategy was to do less work by adding 5+5+5.<p>When I took geometry I often was burned by my teacher when she&#x27;d ask me to come to the board and solve a problem.  She&#x27;d say &quot;You can&#x27;t do that we haven&#x27;t gotten to that part of the book yet, sit down already!&quot;  It all just seemed to logical to me.

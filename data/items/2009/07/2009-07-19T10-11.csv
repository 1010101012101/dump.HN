It's only a little side project and doesn't receive that much traffic, so it's certainly not my main business. But just goes to show, you don't necessarily need millions of page views, or indeed hundreds of thousands if you select your market wisely.",1248001109

712835,comment,712350,712452,0,0,ErrantX,,,"To be 100% fair I have more than paid for my phone since signing the contract :) I rang them up wanting a new phone and asking if they could do me a deal if I agreed to a higher monthly fee and a full 24 month contract (the phone aimed at being an Iphone).<p>When I first rang them last month there was 6 months left on the contract and they were quite happy to do this - except they wanted the full 6 months paid off first! That's more than the phones original value. I offered to pay the value of the phone (seeing as they get my custom for 24 months locked in - and I am a 10yr customer). not interested.<p>I agree - trying to get something for nothing is silly :) but I think I deserve some reward for my loyalty? Especially as I will actually be paying for the phone AND increasing my contract amount (and locking in for 24 months - which really means forever as it's an Iphone :))",1248001073

712830,comment,712341,712807,0,0,heyadayo,,,"> Fact is, there's a huge open source community that would do 90% of that work for free in order to get their names on a high profile project like that.<p>A naive and unworkable strategy at best.<p>As a major open source developer and project leader I've come believe that the majority of relevant open source works comes from a tiny, motivated, and highly skilled minority.  And remember, OSS developers don't work for free because they want their name on some product or webpage. There are jobs for that, and they even pay.",1248000177

712817,comment,712634,712634,0,0,dc2k08,,,"The Blucig started getting marketed about 3-4 months ago. They are actually owned by a very large internet porn king. He rolled out ads on all his sites and consequently they came to the attention of large number of people even though they have been out for about a year and a half prior. Electronic cigarettes are made by about 6-8 factories in China.<p>The Blucig is a rebrand, just as pretty much any the rest of them are. A lot people ordered the Blucig and then flooded the e-cig forums to complain that they had not received their order in over a month. This is either due to the fact that Blu did not foresee demand and did not order enough stock or more likely, their large shipments were seized at customs as the FDA has decided that they are illegal to market (at the request of Senator Frank Laudenberg who received $128,000in campaign donations from Big Pharma) though two other large E-cig companies are currently challenging the FDA's decision in court. The judge is expected to make a decision this week.<p>Smaller home based e-cig companies are still managing to get their shipments to slip in. If you are to order one, I recommend ordering from one of those.<p>E-cigs are currently one of the most spammed products on the internet as far as I can tell. If you read anyone's recommendations, consider whether it is an affiliate. There is a lot of expensive rubbish being spammed. Also consider that these cost $12-$17 wholesale on average and make sure you read the warranty before ordering. Most of them become useless in a very short period of time, batteries especially. Atomizers should be considered consumable products as the liquid will gunk them up. I go through at least one a month.",1247997679

Personally I require proof that the problem has been solved.<p>But anyway, for one while it may be true that most mechanics will simply replace a component when broken, replacements can also be made by anybody and that will drive the cost down and encourage local businesses.<p>And really, many software developers are nothing else than glorified mechanics. Right now the supply and demand curves are favoring us, but give it some time and you&#x27;ll see software developers working for car repair shops.

I thought the whole point of IoT devices was to be <i>attached</i> to an IP network and to -often- be field upgradable.<p>> ...the situation is not as fundamentally flawed as the OP laments.<p>I believe you when you say that these protocols often <i>aren&#x27;t</i> rocket science. I don&#x27;t know for sure -because I&#x27;ve not looked at any specs-, but I would suspect that -most of the time- reason #1 for building a new &quot;smart home&quot; control protocol is to create a new walled garden to call your own.<p>The situation <i>is</i> rather bad. Consider the difference between the current state of email and IM:<p>With email, you use any IMAP or POP3 client of your choosing, input your username, password, and email server hostname, and you&#x27;re done. <i>Anyone</i> who uses email can send an email to you using any software of their choosing at any time.<p>With IM, you have one scenario for reachability, and two for client choice.<p>Reachability:<p>In order for someone to contact you on any IM network that&#x27;s not a federated XMPP network [0], they must first create an account on that network. Users of one network -with rare exception- cannot contact users of another network.<p>So, to speak with a friend, you must know their username, the network that they use, <i>and</i> you must have an account on that network.<p>Client choice:<p>There are two scenarios here:<p>1) You and your friend use an IM network built before ~2008. You get to use the official clients, or Trillian, or a libpurple-powered client. Hooray for you! All your messaging can be handled in a single piece of software!<p>2) You use a contemporary IM network. To speak with a friend, you have to dig up the official client for the network that your friend uses. If you have friends in multiple networks, you have to use <i>other</i>, entirely separate pieces of software to speak with each group of friends. Hope your device of choice makes switching between applications quick and easy. :)<p>With email, you get your choice of clients and can contact <i>any</i> other person hooked to the Internet who uses email. You know that if you send a message to a valid email address, it will eventually get there. With IM, the situation is <i>far</i> more complicated and uncertain.<p>So, to tie it back to lightbulb control protocols:<p>A standard, comprehensive, vendor-independent control protocol -let&#x27;s call it SmartBulb- assures you a few things:<p>* A non-technical consumer goes out and buys any SmartBulb equipment from any store. He <i>knows</i> that it&#x27;ll work without hassle.<p>* When your current lightbulb vendor goes belly up, you can purchase bulbs and controllers from any other players in the industry.<p>* You can switch to more capable or better designed bulbs and controller models without rendering your existing devices useless to you.<p>With a fragmented market, there are a few hazards:<p>* Folks who would reverse-engineer proprietary protocols and sell devices to interoperate with <i>multiple</i> vendor&#x27;s hardware are opening themselves up to great uncertainty in the form of frivolous legal action. [1]<p>* Non-technical users <i>must</i> purchase equipment from a single vendor or cabal of vendors. If those folks go belly up, these users will likely have no place to go to replace their hardware when it eventually wears out.<p>* Somewhat-technical folks who use gratis [2] controllers that are the product of reverse-engineering still have to live with the uncertainty that future revs of products that worked well with their controller no longer do, because of changes to the protocol, or use of parts of the protocol that the reverse engineers were unaware of.<p>If all that is not compelling, then consider this: How would your life change if you couldn&#x27;t be certain that your electronics worked in any given building? That is to say, what would you do differently if -to reliably use your electronics on the go- you had to carry around a fat sack of adaptors, and -even then- sometimes you didn&#x27;t have the right adaptor on you?<p>There&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of value in having a single, comprehensive standard.<p>[0] These days, effectively <i>no</i> IM networks are federated XMPP networks. Noone is sadder about this than I am.<p>[1] Just because it&#x27;s frivolous doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not expensive and time-consuming.<p>[2] Free-as-in-beer",1442926546

I&#x27;m grateful for the reply, but I think you&#x27;ve read too much into my little one-line comment.<p>>Wideband radios are not all that new.<p>No, but super cheap ones are.<p>>It&#x27;s not like tweaking a VFO is really a technical challenge<p>Well, it&#x27;s a little bit of a challenge for most (especially non-hams), but sure, there&#x27;s no magic involved.<p>>The FCC tracks you down and you get a pink slip telling you that they know what you&#x27;re up to.<p>I&#x27;ve heard so many scary stories about the FCC, and yet their enforcement actions page is relatively empty; and hams are always heard complaining about both persistent abusive behavior that the FCC either does little, or is powerless to stop. My impression is that violators, both abusers and unintentional get a lot of chances to correct their behavior; and that FCC enforcement is mostly a paper tiger that can do a bit of damage to someone who wants to comply (for the most part), and can do very little or nothing to stop the worst abusers.<p>Enforcement actions: <a href=""https://transition.fcc.gov/eb/AmateurActions/Welcome.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://transition.fcc.gov/eb/AmateurActions/Welcome.html</a><p>Warning Letters: <a href=""http://transition.fcc.gov/eb/AmateurActions/Legacy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://transition.fcc.gov/eb/AmateurActions/Legacy.html</a><p>>You both underestimate what older radios can do, and overstate what newer radios can do relative to them.<p>I don&#x27;t think so. I know that these features, or reasonable substitutes for them exist/have existed for some time, but I also know that their widespread use was limited, primarily due to cost. Economies of scale in manufacturing mean that since a TV tuner chip which produced in the billions can be used as an SDR, now there are lots of very inexpensive SDR units available for purchase. For higher end equipment, there is also the fact that DSP tech has advanced at a pretty incredible pace enabling things like the ~$300 dollar 100MHz oscilloscopes in my lab and also the 500MHz scopes in my lab that didn&#x27;t cost more than our minivan. Sure, many (maybe even most) of the things that can be done with an SDR can also be done with solder and wires, but an SDR can do any/all of them. A super cheap (as in < $10) SDR can act as a frequency analyzer (to use GP&#x27;s term) can compliment a high quality analog radio design. I suspect that one could add that kind of feature to an analog radio and keep the total additional cost under $10.<p>>The reasons that you didn&#x27;t see people transmitting off-band before was primarily social, not technological.<p>I think you&#x27;ve hit the nail on the head here. There simply isn&#x27;t any/much of a problem, and where the problems do exist the FCC is largely toothless anyway (and that&#x27;s arguably a good thing). The FCC sees the potential for cheap consumer equipment that can easily be made non-compliant; they know that they haven&#x27;t the resources to enforce the rules against millions of people and want to simply prevent it from happening. There is a reason that the FCC has so little enforcement is because nobody who knows them, likes them.<p>>FCC was flipping out about people intercepting cellphone calls on omniband radios - 15 years ago.<p>Another reason to dislike the FCC, they made a rule which was almost totally ineffective, and today is completely moot; because the technology prevents the problem that the rule was supposed to prevent. The cost of scanners/radios went up, and some good products were taken off the market and replaced with junk, or simply not replaced. Yay FCC.<p>> Omni SDR was around 10 years ago too, with the same capabilities (see: GNU Radio), it just cost more than $10 for a rig.<p>A lot more than $10, and you had less &quot;SD&quot; for your SDR because your PC and the software was simply less capable. Now, a relative noob can start from practically nothing and point and click his/her way to receiving any number of things in an afternoon.",1442926500

This is not a very helpful attitude. The only &quot;UNIX-y&quot; thing I see it&#x27;s doing is forking for concurrency.

what in the OP is/is not <i>real</i>.
Here I am not talking for/against
<i>abortion</i> but about eighth grade civics
on the SCOTUS and US Constitution:<p>&quot;But the party’s real stand 
on the sanctity of female biology

the debate by Walker’s and 
Marco Rubio’s endorsement 
of a ban on abortions for 
women who have been raped or risk dying in 
childbirth.&quot;<p><i>Real</i>?  That&#x27;s about where I want to
stop reading the OP.<p>Why?
I know that for me eighth grade
civics was a long time ago, but
as I recall (1) the SCOTUS case of
Roe v Wade that made abortion legal
is now 40+ years old; (2) to change
that decision need (A) a <i>lot</i> of what
would be, say, <i>unlikely</i> new SCOTUS
nominations or (B) a Constitutional
amendment that would take 2/3rds of
the House, 2/3rds of the Senate,
and 3/4ths of the states.  So, first-cut,
intuitively, IMHO, for either (A) or (B),
any way to have &quot;a ban on abortions&quot;
is decades away.  Considering how often
we have Constitutional amendments,
maybe centuries.<p>Real?  Talking about &quot;a ban on abortions&quot;

In the area in question, for a <i>very</i> long time people thought that it was impossible for the a tsunami to go above 5 meters.  That there were tsunami of that size in other areas is irrelevant.  The earthquake in question was the most powerful in 1000 years.  Looking back 100 years would be insufficient.<p>What is interesting is that there was actually a city that raised the sea walls to 16 meters in the area.  The mayor of that city was actually sent to jail because it was a scam to siphon money to his brother in law who was in construction.  I don&#x27;t remember the details because it was on a TV program that I watched about a year ago, but unfortunately the mayor in question died a couple of years before the tsunami and never lived to see that his actions actually saved the city.<p>Speaking of the seawall height, there were, indeed, studies done that showed that under certain circumstances 15-18 meter high tsunamis could be generated in that area.  This was disregarded.  &quot;Why&quot;, you ask.<p>Let me explain.  I live by the sea in Japan.  I can go to the sea side and climb up on the sea wall.  It is 5 meters above sea level.  I can walk along it all practically all the way to Tokyo (200 km away).  The only places where it doesn&#x27;t exist is where there are natural cliffs (which are not as prevalent as you might imagine).  Every little stream  that empties into the ocean has a 5 meter high metal sea gate that can be closed in the event of a tsunami.  Where I live there is one at least every km or so.<p>The sea walls in Japan are <i>already</i> a miracle of engineering.  You want to make them 20m high?  Around the entire country?  This is an insane notion.<p>To be honest, I will take the risk.  I don&#x27;t want to live in a jail where the only place I can see the ocean is from on top of a mountain.<p>I live in Sagara, Shizuoka (now merged with Makinohara).  It is the most dangerous place in Japan to live for earthquakes because of the imminent Tokai earthquake (50 years overdue, unless it actually happened in WWII when the place was already destroyed and nobody had the ability to measure the big earthquake that happened then).  5% of the population is likely to die by all predictions.<p>Which means 95% will live.  Terrible tragedy, but <i>not</i> worse than surrounding yourself in a 20m high jail IMHO.<p>Now, there were many human failures regarding the Fukushima disaster (like not having the correct connectors to power the pumps externally).  Sea walls is <i>not</i> one of them.",1442923855

The OP sounds like its a fundamental problem, my point was that it&#x27;s just an implementation problem.<p>&quot;Tragically, the folks who make the hardware disagree. :(&quot;<p>Not all of them do, actually most don&#x27;t; but even for those who do, the good thing is that we don&#x27;t need them (mostly). Most of these protocols aren&#x27;t rocket science, so even those where manufacturers tried to lock it down, people have reverse engineered it (e.g. Somfy). And the good thing is that because it&#x27;s hardware, vendors can&#x27;t just roll out a &#x27;patch&#x27; or break the interface in the next cycle because that&#x27;d leave their existing customers in the cold.<p>Look, I understand the point, and it would be great if everybody went kumbayaa around The One Perfect Standard, but the situation is not as fundamentally flawed as the OP laments.",1442923480

He remembers when his family were cast out on to the street and lost everything, because they owned a few plots of land that they rented out to neighbors in their rural village and were therefore capitalists. So when you start talking about capitalism, let&#x27;s be clear. We&#x27;re talking about the basic right to own personal property, and those arguing against capitalism are arguing for taking that away. They&#x27;ve done it before and given the chance will do it again. It&#x27;s not theory, it&#x27;s my family history, but is something that is directly relevant to every single one of us.",1442923217

Successfully funded projects could readily be considered to be ones where the funding has enabled project success.<p>In their terms Kickstarter make statements suggesting it is a funding program but they also say in their &quot;Acceptance of Terms&quot; part that any policy expounded on the site is incorporated by reference. Kickstarter state on their /learn page for example &quot;Kickstarter is a vibrant community of people working together to bring new things to life.&quot; making it clear that success on Kickstarter is bringing a making project to fruition. It _doesn&#x27;t_ say &quot;Kickstarter is a way to acquire funding&quot;, so that&#x27;s not the goal of a Kickstarter project and thus not the measure of success.<p>To reiterate this point, in the FAQ accountability section it says:<p>> &quot;On Kickstarter, backers (you!) ultimately decide the validity and worthiness of a project by whether they decide to fund it.&quot; //<p>Again highlighting that projects are not funding, projects are encouraged with funding.<p>There&#x27;s little about unsuccessful projects, some details about how they&#x27;re swept under the rug, but there is this in the FAQs:<p>> &quot;If the problems are severe enough that the creator can&#x27;t fulfill their project, creators need to find a resolution. Steps could include offering refunds, detailing exactly how funds were used, and other actions to satisfy backers.&quot; //<p>See that &quot;could&quot;, why not &quot;must&quot;? Why not &quot;creators are required by their assent to our contract to find a resolution&quot;? It seems Kickstarter consider a report of how funds used to satisfy their requirements.<p>There is this, <a href=""https://ksr-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/creator-responsibility.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ksr-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/creator-responsibility.p...</a>, which appears to contradict that FAQ.<p>[PS I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve convinced myself but I do think someone could make this case, possibly make it stick. Kickstarter could tighten up their language in a few places but ultimately they are financially primarily motivated to get as many projects funded as possible whether they are successful or not, funded projects earn them money whilst shipped rewards don&#x27;t. Kickstarters other motivations aside of course.]",1405079915

It&#x27;s the ad industry that&#x27;s got to change somehow. We&#x27;re trying to be part of that. What&#x27;s shocking to us is how the ad industry mostly doesn&#x27;t even recognise how fast adblock is growing. To them, it just looks like more people have switched off their PCs, because they just can&#x27;t see that segment of the audience anymore. Therefore, they&#x27;re having a really hard time figuring out that this is even happening to them.",1405076838

My friends no longer want to go out to bars and clubs because they all did this when they were younger.<p>Part of me would love to put all of my belongings in storage, take my laptop and freelance from around the world.<p>My monthly outgoings are $2,500/£1,500 for rent and bills (I live on my own) and this is covered by my freelance work (8 hours per WEEK) so I barely have to touch my savings.<p>I want to meet more people, make more friends, meet more girls, have fun, come across exciting work opportunities, etc but I am not doing this right now.<p>What would YOU do?",1405076722

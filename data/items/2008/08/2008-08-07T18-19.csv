Using a boolean constant to represent ""not a string"" when there are <i>legal string values that are equal to that constant</i> is a design bug, that you are working around via the identity operator.

If you're into things like that then just go read ""Effective Java"" by Joshua Bloch (who also happens to be at Google at the moment).

The wiki idea is very, very interesting - it's got that same ""I'm not doing this for money but to help the world be a better place"" vibe that (imho) is what makes Wikipedia successful.  There are valid criticisms of this approach in the comments, namely that it would require a very strict quality control process before educators could trust it.

After a few uses, people build up the muscle memory that ""action, confirmation"" <i>is</i> the action.  Then the one time in a hundred they want to cancel, they don't realize until too late.<p>One approach to try would be, for any purchase over $5, make a ""confirmation step"" that looks like a restaurant bill, and require the user to sign it (with their finger).  Perhaps ""sign name next to a big number"" would be enough to jar them.<p>But really, the solution is to make it undoable/refundable.  No matter what barriers you put up, somebody will do it by mistake (guaranteed), and is going to want their money back.

However, to say that one can't put <i>any</i> probability measure on countable finite sets, the minimum that would be required to have a definition of ""most"", is clearly false.<p>I might say ""most words have vowels"", and few people would disagree with me that this is a valid claim. The denominator is infinity, in the sense that I'm not constricting ""words"" to those existing now, and language is an open system. The set of strings that could conceivably become words is infinite. (Who would have predicted ""blog"" and ""pwn""?) On the other hand, if we place a probability measure on words according to frequency of use (allowing that m(""zwrskwzpn"") might be some very, very small positive number instead of 0) we can now make statements such as ""most words contain vowels"", with the tacit understanding that our claim of ""most"" involves a weighting according to frequency of use.",1218133821

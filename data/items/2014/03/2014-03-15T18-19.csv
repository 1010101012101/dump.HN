So no matter what, the gamepad/trackball is going to be a handicap.  I think we&#x27;re all just hoping for &quot;good enough&quot;, not &quot;as good as a mouse&quot;.

For example, the pseudocode on Wikipedia (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort#Pseudocode"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort#Pseudocode</a>) at a quick glance uses five temporary variables: &#x27;count&#x27;, &#x27;end&#x27;, &#x27;start&#x27;, &#x27;child&#x27;, and &#x27;root&#x27;. How much temporary space is this? Well, proportional to the log of the size of the array, at a minimum. If you&#x27;re sorting 256-element arrays, these can each be 8-bit integers, and you need 5 bytes of temporary space. If you&#x27;re sorting a 2^32 element array, these need to each be at least 32-bit integers, and you need 20 bytes of temporary space. If you have a 2^64 element array, they need to be 64-bit integers, and you need 40 bytes of temporary space. If you have a 2^128 element array, they need to be 128-bit integers, and you need 80 bytes of temporary space. Therefore, temporary space needed grows with the log of the array size. Which is very slow growth, but still growth!<p>The two things you can do are: 1) pick a fixed-size int and cap the max size of array you can handle; or 2) use a bigint datatype, and the size of your bigints will (asymptotically) grow with log(n).",1394909656

So, requiring every single range to overload an operator for trivial searching is not good, especially since there are only a few containers that have non-trivial searching.<p>Instead, the range-based find could be specialized for containers that have non-trivial searching instead(perhaps it calls a `.find` method if available otherwise it does trivial searching).<p>In [Linq](<a href=""http://pfultz2.github.io/Linq/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pfultz2.github.io/Linq/</a>), the find is specialized for mapped containers and for strings(it doesn&#x27;t check for a `.find` method since that can&#x27;t be done on msvc). So you can search a `std::vector` like this:<p><pre><code>    std::vector<int> v = { ... };\n    auto it = v | linq::find(123);\n</code></pre>\nAnd you can also search the keys of a map like this:<p><pre><code>    std::map<int, std::string> m = { ... };\n    auto it = m | linq::find(123);\n</code></pre>\nPlus, it has a contains function, so you can do this:<p><pre><code>    if (v | linq::contains(123))\n</code></pre>\nOr this:<p><pre><code>    if (m | linq::contains(123))\n</code></pre>\nThere really is no need for a new operator just for this, since a function will suffice.

Therefore for the time being my assumption is that the harassment and mismanagement both happened.<p>That said, although I have seen mountains of evidence for 1) and 2), because the amount of evidence for the specific situation is small, that means a small amount of counter-evidence about the specific situation could easily shift the balance of probabilities.<p>That said, I have seen quite a bit of evidence that such accusations are only rarely false, so while I would change my balance of properties readily, I don&#x27;t expect that to happen.",1394907986

7405524,comment,7404866,7405155,1,0,EGreg,,,"You are missing a few things in dismissing the above articles.<p>1. Wikipedia article specifically speaks about the power levels of wifi, which is what I stress also above, saying there&#x27;s a big difference between the power level in charging a car and catching a wifi signal from an already-charged device. Moreover, here is the full context of your quote:<p>&quot;In response to public concern, the WHO established the International EMF Project in 1996 to assess the scientific evidence of possible health effects of EMF in the frequency range from 0 to 300 GHz. They have stated that although extensive research has been conducted into possible health effects of exposure to many parts of the frequency spectrum, all reviews conducted so far have indicated that, as long as exposures are below the limits recommended in the ICNIRP (1998) EMF guidelines, which cover the full frequency range from 0–300 GHz, such exposures do not produce any known adverse health effect. [2] Of course, by the very definition of such limits, stronger or more frequent exposures to EMF can be unhealthy, and in fact serve as the basis for electromagnetic weaponry.<p>International guidelines on exposure levels to microwave frequency EMFs such as ICNIRP limit the power levels of wireless devices and it is uncommon for wireless devices to exceed the guidelines. These guidelines only take into account thermal effects, as nonthermal effects have not been conclusively demonstrated.[3] The official stance of the British Health Protection Agency is that “[T]here is no consistent evidence to date that WiFi and WLANs adversely affect the health of the general population”, but also that “...it is a sensible precautionary approach...to keep the situation under ongoing review...”.[4]&quot;<p>2. As I said cellphone radiation (particularly near cell towers) is higher than Wifi and has its own studies.<p>3. Not true, it is known that brain sites near the phone heat up and increase metabolic rate after cellphone use, studies in Scandinavia showed that people had brain tumors more frequently on the side they used the cellhone. Although to be fair, all these studies currently suffer from recall bias. A good overview is found here:<p><a href=""http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_jwk18huJI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_jwk18huJI</a><p>4. The study was done by Volkow at the National Institute of Health and reported in Scientific American, Discover Magazine and other venues. This provides more info and a link to the study:<p><a href=""http://microwavenews.com/Volkow.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://microwavenews.com/Volkow.html</a><p>5. These people exist and those are their stories. Their sensitivity to electromagnetic fields is a documented condition called EHS, which admittedly has not yet been recognized in double blind studies. My point is that as the power level grows, MORE people will experience the symptoms as people&#x27;s sensitivity to electromagnetic fields is a contiuum.<p><a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_hypersensitivity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_hypersensitiv...</a>",1394907250

Even in the negligible timescale of our own species we&#x27;ve seen repeated cycles of collapse, the planet is littered with the remains of failed species. The only reason this needs study is because we&#x27;re so arrogant as to believe there&#x27;s an exemption clause in the fine print of the immutable laws of the universe, just for us. Scarier still is that we don&#x27;t even have to be all godded up to believe that, it&#x27;s how we&#x27;re born. (Tangent: watch &quot;Through The Wormhole&quot; the episode &quot;Does Belief in God Cause More Self Control?&quot;)<p>A collapse is coming, it&#x27;s just a question of when. 10 years? 100 years? 1000 years? a million?<p>Personally I&#x27;d lean toward the lower end of the scale. Whilst a substantial percentage of the world subscribes philosophies that essentially reinforce our innate belief that the earth &quot;belongs&quot; to man. Her resources perhaps put there for us to consume by some higher being. We&#x27;re pretty fucked. Ecological responsibility can&#x27;t be discussed with any creature that ultimately believes that a a higher being provides for them. Heck you can&#x27;t even begin to discuss the timescales involved rationally with the vast majority of faiths around, and those that you can engage in dialogue are numerically so insignificant as to not matter.<p>Then there&#x27;s the question of reproduction. Whilst first world populations are shrinking, the third world is growing, and we in the first world can&#x27;t even agree that it would be in our own long term interests to pay for the education and food of every last man, woman and child amongst them that needs it. The reasons are purely selfish: it&#x27;s the only humane way we can have even the slightest chance of avoiding a world with 10 + billion people on it. If the thought of that doesn&#x27;t terrify you, it should. Assuming we agree that societal patterns observed in the past hold true of the future, then trouble and strife breeds conflict, breeds fascism, breeds violence. Picture a world a few decades from now where the poorest two thirds, armed with today&#x27;s most horrific weapons use the model set by the past as their compass for the future. I&#x27;d wager the odds are heavily stacked in favour of things getting very bloody at some point. Believing that, whilst some may play with cataclysmic weapons, the genie will stay in the bottle for the rest, is naive at best.

We evolved geared to favour today and next week over next month or next year. Few plan and act for long term benefit even on a human scale, and collectively that&#x27;s going to bite us in the ass. I don&#x27;t imagine this is something that sits well with the entrepreneurial spirit of HN readers, but before you stand up and shout &quot;Hey! I plan! I save! I recycle!&quot; or whatever, remember this is about us in aggregate, each of us individually are quite irrelevant.<p>Ok, I&#x27;m done, I can&#x27;t begin to address this subject properly.<p><pre><code>  “I&#x27;m gonna share with you a vision that I had, cause I love you.

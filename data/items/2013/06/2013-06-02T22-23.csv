5810426,comment,5810075,5810075,16,0,bitwize,,,"This article's ""philosophy of Emacs"" runs counter to the conventional wisdom that ""Emacs is a good operating system, it just needs a decent text editor"". If anything what the author describes is a ""philosophy of Acme"" -- do as much as possible by piping in and out of external processes. While Emacs can do this, there is no guiding principle to favor it over elisp extensions.<p>I think the philosophy of Emacs, if it has one, is ""maximum extensibility"". Whether that be with elisp or external processes matters not.<p>EDIT: forgot the word ""conventional"" :)",1370213935
5810425,comment,5805460,5807145,3,0,scholia,,,"> I fail to see the problem at all from the viewpoint of the corporation.<p>You're right, as long as the corporation doesn't mind if the public see it as a bunch of greedy, grasping, evil corporate bastards.<p>In Google's case, its ""selling point"" is ""Don't be evil"" and its business depends on trust. It's rapidly losing that trust.<p>For the record, Google's UK turnover in 2011 was 2.7bn, and based on its profitability, it's making about 676m and should be paying more than 180m in tax in that one year. In fact, it has paid a <i>total</i> of 10 million between 2006 and 2011 on revenues of 11.9bn.<p>If Google was a moral, ethical company then it would pay taxes that cover the cost of doing business in the UK, where it benefits from UK government expenditure on maintaining the country as a good place to do business (roads, schools, health services, police etc).<p>Essentially, Google is using fancy international book-keeping to defraud the British public.<p>That's evil in my book, whatever Google thinks.",1370213925

Making it illegal for them to work for a price they're willing to accept could hurt them quite a bit.</i><p>Oh, but I said it should only be allowed if it's paid for. So that will actually HELP those needing the extra money ""brought by longer work weeks"".<p>What happens now it that people slave away extra hours for the same basic salary, and don't get any overtime pay.<p>And I think it will also help unemployed people wanting work. A company will have to hire 3 people, instead of slaving 2 for 12 hours a day (and it wont hurt them, since no other company could slave 2 people either to get the advantage for themselves).",1370213863
5810422,comment,5809724,5810327,2,0,sillysaurus,,,"Well, you'll want to think one level of abstraction higher than that. Imagine a camera. When you push a camera forward towards a wall, the wall stays the same size. It just fills more of your view.<p>You can code the equivalent of that pretty simply. So even if a png is 13x13, it might be drawn as 30x30 if the camera zooms in, or as 5x5 if the camera zooms out.<p>It's actually much simpler (and more visually consistent) to do it that way. It's probably more difficult to learn, but it's well worth the time spent learning it.",1370213846
5810421,comment,5809092,5809387,4,0,lsc,,,">As you read them, just keep in mind that there is no agreed-upon definition of ""autism"" or ""Asberger's Syndrome"". (Nor does autism exist on a defined one-dimensional spectrum, contrary to popular belief.) Each individual is wildly different. So ""severe autism"" in one person might mean that person can't talk. In another it might mean they have seizures. In another it might mean they can hold a conversation but can't tie their shoes. The media tends to gloss over this major issue, and in so doing it wrongly connects many poorly-understood discrete neurological disorders.<p>This is what I find so weird.   I hear people talking about their autistic child or autistic nephew or something as if they are profoundly disabled.  But I've worked with sysadmins and with programmers who had autism diagnoses. And sure, some of them were difficult to communicate with, but they were working with me, and usually fairly competent at their jobs, I mean competent enough that it was worth significant effort to figure out how to communicate with them.<p>That, and I work with a lot of people who are hard to communicate with;  while only a few of them have told me that their psychiatrist has diagnosed them with this or that... (I mean, considering the stigmas involved, generally speaking, disclosing your mental health issues to all but those you are closest to is a bad idea.)<p>so my assumption was that if a few of the people I worked with /had/ told me, well there are bound to be others who just keep it under their hat.<p>But then, if I encounter an Autism advocate, they seem to think I'm very wrong in think there are a large number of socially disabled but otherwise functional folks with Autism, and that I'm doing autistic folks a disservice by thinking so.<p>>The upshot is that even though it may be great that this particular individual benefits from Coursera, the vast majority of ""autistic"" individuals I have come across are not capable of processing anything that might be taught in a college-level course. Coursera cannot help them, although perhaps some more basic technologies might.<p>I think there is a /lot/ of selection bias here, for both of us.    I put a good bit of effort into putting myself in situations where you could reasonably argue that I'm the dumbest guy in the room, and am usually provably the worst programmer in the room, and I'm not involved in caring for the 'profoundly disabled' -  so I am choosing what I see.<p>On the other hand, most Autism advocates spend time with those most profoundly disabled;  they need the most help, after all.   Someone who mostly has life under control, likely, would keep it between himself/herself and the shrink, so I would imagine that shapes how they see the world, too.<p>But yeah, I never understood why they used the same word for the guy next to me that can kick my ass at everything but talking, and the kid who can't talk at all.",1370213816
5810420,comment,5806132,5809648,5,0,FD3SA,,,"The key distinction here is that travelling to those places as a successful entrepreneur is worlds apart from being born there, without any genetic or environmental advantages to help one escape such a fate.<p>Michael is speaking from a broad base of experience, one that is not just a hero's epic of one success after another with a token failure before the ultimate victory. From the heroic perspective (PG, Zuck, Gates, etc.), every setback is but a small dip before eventual triumph. These people sincerely believe that anyone can do what they have, and as a result their worldviews are extremely limited and naive. In a way, they cannot know the other side of the story, because they have never experienced any other outcome.<p>The cold truth is that the situation Michael describes is reality for the vast majority of the working world. The darling VC-fund kids are a tiny minority, selling hopes and dreams to the masses in exchange for their servitude as employees who will never join their ranks.<p>It is very hard to see the system as a whole when one is so deeply immersed in one side of it. VC startups will not save the common man. If anything, they will put him out of work and ask him to ""retrain"", putting him in massive debt for an entry level position making far less than his previous job.<p>All this being said, I am extremely optimistic for the future, but I understand that the US requires significant structural reform if everyone is to benefit from technology. Not everyone can be a successful startup founder or programmer, and as soon as we accept that, we can move onto an earnest conversation about what needs to be done to make a better future for all, elite and commoner alike.",1370213783

5810415,comment,5808904,5808904,4,0,swalsh,,,"Here's the thing, estimating software development time is essentially equivalent to estimating time to think + overhead.  Overhead includes actually typing the code, booting the computer, dealing SVN issues, etc.  The overhead is relatively consistent, and can be minimized and predicted.  Time to think is highly variable.  Previously I used to work for a consulting company.  After about a year of working there the company started to settle in a particular niche.  We built libraries to do things, then we just started to churn out work.  Predicting development time became an exact science, because all we had to do was estimate overhead.  There was very little new things, so time to think was minimized to nearly nothing.  I hated working in a code factory, so I left for greener pastures.  The new place has a lot of new things, trying to fit it together is a real challenge, and requires thinking.  My estimates are no where near where they were at my old company.<p>My main point is this, estimating software time is hard because you don't know what you don't know.  If you can solve that problem, you solved one of humanity's greatest challenges.",1370213543

You may not have the chops, but you can still create amazing work.<p>With programming, I have the issue of wanting to catch up on everything and do side-projects (eventually, I'll run through this <i>class</i> => <a href=""http://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~jay/courses/2012/fall/330/course/gc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~jay/courses/2012/fall/330/course/...</a>), but I have found success in trying to pick-up things in conjunction with a task at hand. If I have to build a web service, I'll start that research simultaneously. Starting IOS work... then spend time with C, understand Objective-C's runtime, read about the history (and play around with Smalltalk). This piece-meal approach seems to make the jump more ""doable"" in my opinion.<p>I think that people without a CS degree can obtain a good, challenging gig if they have a good niche to school themselves in, and of course, pick-up the gaps from the people they work along with who have that background/knowledge.",1370213511

 Jordan probably wants to preemptively downplay the regional uprising lest it motivates internal uprisings.<p>Additionally, Potential uprising in Jordan will give second thoughts to global players who have been wanting to arm the Syrian rebels (mainly to block Iran's retaliation path from Lebanon against an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facility, now and in the future).

It is beautiful, as many writers have shown. In past years I have been a great appreciator of this, having held strong libertarian and even anarcho-capitalist values (not a part of the Ayn Rand hype train, I assure you).<p>But politico-economic systems are much more complex, human nature so rich, that logic and rhetoric cannot fully capture, perhaps ever.

And I just don't think the victory and purity of Western idealism -- that it is the One Way, the Only Way -- is as valid as most of us think.

There are so many systems of principles now, that clash all the time -- and they themselves have changed drastically from the USA of 100 years ago. Thus the Libertarian argument still stands.

- maintains its value
- it's commonly recognized to do trade<p>GOvernment decree can't make money as it can't make summer in December. People need to recognize it as money. It needs to keep its value over time.<p>So money <i>can be</i> a commodity. Can be a virtual currency. Can be pretty much anything as long as people perceive it as such and as long it maintains its value in the long periods of time.<p>The problem with USD and any other fiat money is that they really never, never, never, ever meet the point 1 from the definition above - money printed by governments never keeps it's value over long time. Hence fake money. BTW, this is what lack of competition and central planning (via central banks) did to it. Read some financial history and give me just a sinle one example of fiat currency that survived long period of time. Forget maintaining value. I will make it easier for you - a fiat currency that <i>survived</i> more than 150 years. There is <i>none</i> in 3000 years monetary history. That's why gold is the ultimate money. Because it hold its value. And gold isn't really neccessary to have a solid currency. After hyperinflation in Germany in 1921 they tied the Mark to the German Land. Each mark represented certain amount of land. This stopped hyperinflation in its tracks. As long as these pieces of paper are supported by something more than politicians promises it is ok.<p>BitCoin has limited supply thanks to the algorithm.

We <i>could</i> add those features, and we could do so with ease (CMUCL and SBCL already have low-level pointer operations and a form of inline assembly language); the only reason we do not is that <i>nobody has time to rewrite billions of lines of C code</i>, or perhaps more that nobody will spend the money to do such a thing.  The existence of C at various levels of the software stack is a historical artifact, primarily a result of Unix having been written in C and OSes written in other languages having been marketed poorly.<p>The lesson is not that C is <i>good</i> for writing low-level code; the lesson is that technical features are not terribly important.<p>I would also point out that an OS is not just about interrupt handlers and device drivers.  Most of an OS is high-level code that is connected to interrupt handlers and device drivers through an interface.  Even if C were the best language in the world for writing low-level code, I would still question the use of C elsewhere (imagine, as an alternative, an OS that follows the design of Emacs -- a small core written in C, the rest written in Lisp).",1370211323

Alice before the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the division is more between the generalists (good) and patent specialists (evil). The CAFC governs federal employment and some international trade matters so there are some generalists. The patent reform side was one patent lawyer and four generalists; the unlimited patents side (""everything under the sun made by man"" - actual quote) was four patent lawyers and one with the unusual specialties of federal employment and intellectual property law. The good guys were Bush-Clinton-Bush-Obama-Obama appointees and the baddies Reagan-Bush-Clinton-Bush-Obama, with only a slight and insignificant D/R lead for good, in contrast to the Supremes.<p>Maybe Congress is ineffective on both partisan benches and in both houses.

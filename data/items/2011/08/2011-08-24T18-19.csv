Why not choose fields that are more closely related and let's see how the average software developer is doing vs. those working in those fields?<p>For example, let's say, electronics engineer - I would hazard to say that the average software developer is earning  higher than the average circuit designer.<p>Sure, you are saying that software is pervasive in our lives and extremly important - but all software runs on some hardware, which was designed by an electronics engineer.<p>Engineering and science related careers have never been amongst the top paid jobs in the society we live in - and you could argue for many engineering fields that they are amongst the most important jobs in our current economy (be it construction engineers, automotive, aerospace engineering, energy production, whatever). I don't really see why programmers should earn much more than people working in these fields.",1314212399
2922045,comment,2921144,2921612,3,0,gatlin,,,"I've recently dived into Perl. Its most powerful feature, in my relatively short experience, is that it provides powerful semantics for everything - text manipulation, symbol table manipulation at runtime, packages, etc - and it also just gives up and assumes it's on a Unix system (hence the power as a ""glue"" language). Additionally, you can define new subroutines at run-time and replace most any part of the language at a whim. It's fast, and there is a very sane and simple subset of the language that's very readable and easy.<p>It is not, however, terribly sexy, and the cult of personality around Wall has turned off a few people I know. I am continually surprised at the simple solutions I can get out of Perl (and the complexity I am allowed to work with should I choose to).",1314212399

But our support team is extremely serious about fixing it, cleaning it up, keeping it up-to-date, and using it as a platform from which we can distribute printed, old-school manuals.   The idea here would be that appropriately tagged answers are automatically collated into a print manual; keeping the manual up-to-date would necessarily also ensure that the StackExchange is up-to-date and vice-versa.  Think a QA-focused wiki, more than anything else.<p>They're working on this very hard right now, so I'm hoping that I have something concrete to point to, soon.  If it works out, I think it might be a great direction for Facebook to go, too, both providing the social pressures necessary to keep lightly trod StackExchanges up-to-date, and providing a way for Facebook to possibly have organized, accurate documentation for the first time in forever.",1314211780

The experimenter was always involved in an interminable conversation with someone else.  Subjects whose word puzzles had scattered words invoking rudeness -- bold, rude, bother, disturb, intrude -- had no trouble interrupting.

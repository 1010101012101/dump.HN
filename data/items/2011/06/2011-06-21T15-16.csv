One is a complaint from friends of mine that I haven't personally tripped over; others are my own issues from assorted hilarious Failures Of Graphics Programming.<p>* A total lack of typing. Everything is a GLuint. By the time I've bodged together sufficient type safety to be comfortable, it looks like DirectX.<p>* Extensions suck. Abjectly suck. While Direct3D has its problems, it does a pretty good job of saying ""you must support these things"". OpenGL attempts to vaguely say the same thing, but the difference is that Direct3D enforces support of things I want to use. It seems that you end up with many more code paths for OpenGL if you want to properly handle a lot of stuff.<p>* Difficult to query about GLSL problems, if possible at all. (An older example that's stuck with me is the noise() function, which nobody implemented the last time I dealt with this stuff. They returned a constant. Detecting this failure mode was nontrivial.)<p>* Tooling. As usual, Microsoft is way ahead in this area.<p>A project of mine uses OpenGL instead of D3D, but that's primarily because I'm not the graphics guy on that project. My own stuff just uses XNA, as it's 2D stuff I want to deploy to the 360.",1308671819

2679247,comment,2675524,2679088,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I agree, although its the 'light users' thing. I see folks who own iPads as fashion accessories and have no use for them at all too. My claim was that if that was the only category of user, then the overall sales figures would be much smaller (the 'fashion' user base is limited). I've seen business folks (sales people for example) come to meetings with an iPad as their only tool, they type on it like they might a laptop. It doesn't seem to be 'fashion' for them.<p>And there are folks who use them as color e-readers too. I've got my entire O'Reilly book collection on mine, not something I thought would be useful but it is. And there are the kids in schools using them to replace textbooks.<p>Its hard to get real data without actually polling those users to see if they are 'just experimenting' or if they have changed their workflow to require an iPad or tablet. If its the latter the change is durable.<p>Sales volume of 15 million for the iPad 1? [1] And more than 20 million projected for the iPad 2? That many 'light' users who have $500 minimum to shell out for a fashion accessory? (if they are re-buying and the bizjournal article says they are) then really that is over $1000 for that accessory. So I'm interested in what the actual use case is that it putting iPads into people's hands and keeping them there.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2011/03/14/apples-ipad-sales-blow-past-projections.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2011/03/14/apples-ip...</a>",1308671367

2679245,comment,2677899,2678482,10,0,hubriz,,,"> doesnt seem like a large assumption<p>It is for the reason I've mentioned before: XNA abstracts out pretty much everything. With XNA you're not programming to the metal anymore, which is unfortunately true with WebGL. The greatest concern seems to be with the way OGL handles various buffers. For example in WebGL it is possible to create bufferData stating that it's of size X and provide Y values with Y much smaller than X. What you get is a buffer full of stale data from the memory. Bad idea.<p>Also there's much less ""stuff"" you can break in XNA with lower profile levels (feature sets) which are suitable for the web. E.g. you can't write shaders for the mobile devices today for both security and perf reasons. You get a preset amount of them and that's it. Yes, it's limiting, but you can't choke GPU to death and you can't submit shader payload that's known to crash given driver.<p>It's all about false equivalence that author makes in his blog entry. Problems exist with pretty much every piece of advanced software. But you can add small attack vector, or a large one. They are not equal and making it seem otherwise is bogus.<p>JS is amazing and I love 2D canvas. But WebGL is trying to put low-level stuff in the high-level code. It's awesome in terms of performance, but is inherently fragile and may be abused easily. It seems that it's not sensible programmers MS is afraid of but malicious attackers. And it's very unlikely that WebGL won't be happily abused.<p>As for Carmack, he stated at various occasions that he's closely following web graphics. He's also more than knowledgeable about the issues with drivers, how they can be hit even accidentally and how (un)likely it is for hardware vendor to fix them timely.<p>Also aside from the security, drawing from my experience, it is extremely difficult to make semi-advanced graphics code perform well and look acceptably similar on different GPUs. This is something APIs exposed in the high-level languages (which JS I think undeniably is) should hide from the developer, not dump on him. The fact that there are two different 3D canvas contexts - webgl and experimental-webgl - doesn't really help.",1308671334

There is no novel approach their corporate marketing team can come up with that will rival the winning formula Apple has produced. Apple's marketing today is probably better suited to the market than even the Think Different campaign in 1984.<p>Moreover, Apple has made their bones by contrasting themselves against beige corporate culture. Nokia is very beige.<p>Apple has framed the debate on their terms. So Nokia can choose to flail around in a mediocre attempt to find a different marketing strategy that works.... Or they can copy the unrivaled, unrelenting market leader. They are trying to produce a cool, trendy, powerful little smartphone. Why not embrace the Apple formula as best as you can. You're playing on their turf,  so try to present yourself the way they do.<p>Or, in other words, when in Rome do as the Romans do.",1308669203

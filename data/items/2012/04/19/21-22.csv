That limits it to the performance of a single CPU core + IO limitations. This also applies to things like sub-queries: in a database they could be run separatly, but in Splunk they aren't.<p>It is also fairly expensive at large scale, although the licening model is fair (it is licensed by data volume, so you can install it on as many machines as you like and share the license between them).",1334872528

And I do like implicit returns, and they're one of the main reasons I'm using CoffeeScript in some projects.<p>What I was trying to express was that I don't generally run into this issue in ruby because the similar looping constructs don't behave this way, and don't carry the same kind of unexpected side-effects:<p><pre><code>    def test(lst) lst.each{|i|do_stuff(i)} end\n</code></pre>\nthis method will return ""lst"" back to me, it won't create any new arrays of the do_stuff(i) results, the same goes for for/while loops, whereas:<p><pre><code>    def test(lst) lst.map{|i|do_stuff(i)} end\n</code></pre>\nwill return the block results. The key difference being that the map method <i>always</i> creates an array and returns it, even if I would have a return; after, so it is consistent.<p>The only situation where I get into the problem is with looping, and after some time using CoffeeScript, only rarely, so it may just be one of those things you have to put up with. Still crops up occasionally after refactoring though.<p>I would not want to get rid of implicit returns, and would far rather continue dealing with the loop problems than that.

Python forces you to instantiate the regex at runtime instead of parse time, so if you want a compiled regex you need a separate bit of code to create it and manage its scope.  Perl's captures pop out in automatic variables that can be directly used and interpolated, making simple parsing tasks (e.g. ""print ""$2 $1\n"" if /.../"") into sequences of easy-to-read one liners instead of page long ""parsers"".<p>All of that is the kind of thing that makes <i>Python</i> people's blood boil, of course, but it's absolutely the reason that regex handling is just so much natural in perl.",1334872201

""Rich people"" - meaning recent tech multi-millionaires are driving an increase in angel investing, but they are not who's driving these 50x revenue multiples for later stage companies. If were to give anyone credit for these multiples, it would be Facebook. They've definitely inflated the value of companies that went out before them (Zynga, Linkedin, Groupon, Pandora) and have helped push up valuations of Dropbox and others. When $100bn is your ceiling for a ""private"" company value, psychologically it allows for much more aggressive private valuations. And it's likely that Facebook private valuation is an extreme outlier, not a ""new normal"", which will lead to a boatload of companies that have their highest valuation ever before they go public.",1334872005

The most popular ones across the Middle East now are in Turkish dubbed in Lebanese Arabic (Yeah :p), and seconds are Egyptian TV shows, so you will have to choose. Pretty much any country makes TV Shows in its own version of Arabic, except in Syria where they used to make historical TV Shows in Classical Arabic. \nWhat I suggest is to watch news outlets like Aljazeera, which you can watch online for free [1]. Don't pay attention to the existing perception of Al Jazeera; they are very professional. And, relevant to our discussion, their Arabic is the best around.

The bottom line is, when you are programming all day and only meeting with maybe an internal manager / team leader, etc there is little reason to dress up. However, I would think if one day you have to sit in on a meeting with an important prospective client, you might dress a little differently than you do normally when you are just doing programming. Business people often dress up because they have meetings and it shows respect to those they meet with, I can often tell around my office when a ""business person"" has a day with no important meetings as they tend to dress down those days.<p>When you go to an interview, you want to show the person respect and it is a special situation, its not just another day at work.

3865247,comment,3862782,3862782,19,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Ok a couple of disclaimers first, one I was one of the original Java folks and two, I've done expert witness work but not in this case.<p>When Java was still 'Oak' there was an interesting, on-going, low level debate about where the 'language' stopped and the 'system' started. There is a very common analogy in C where C pretty much assumes that there is a 'libc' and in libc are functions for doing things like printf().<p>So it was with Java, with the wart/exception that there was no 'main' as Java was designed to be the entire environment, not something you wrote in and then passed a binary to a different environment. Sort of like Python in interactive mode all the time. And that lead to the question of ""what can a programmer assume is true about the environment?"" and the answer was eventually some packages were 'core' and had to be present and some where 'optional' and might not me. Frank Yellin and James Gosling's book on the topic was the definitive reference of what was core and what wasn't.<p>When I was at NetApp (which also used Java (licensed) in their filers) there was an interesting debate with Sun about whether or not one had to pass the compatibility suite to be compliant with the license. Since it wasn't an exported language (customers couldn't write Java code to run on the filer) NetApp argued that insuring it could run NetBeans compatibly was unnecessary. Worse (for NetApp) was that they had their own OS and so the port had taken a while and the newer JDK had a lot of changes (none of which were needed) and it became clear the Sun was just operating on a script. Eventually it escalated up to Scott McNealy who quite reasonably understood that if they insisted on that much effort, NetApp would just move to Python or something like it (equivalent internal effort to porting the newest JDK) and voted for 'money' rather than 'no money'. That the question even came up though really brought home how far Java had moved from its roots of the team arguing to release source, to 'the most profitable on a per-unit basis' that Sun was selling in the end times.<p>Looking at the approaches, I think Oracle is going to lose. And I think they are going to lose for the same reason the font guys lost. My fuzzy memory has it as a Letraset vs Apple suit but it may have been Xerox (sad how stuff from 30 yrs ago is so hard to find) which basically concluded you could copyright the <i>name</i> of a font but you could not copyright how it looked. Hence font names like ""Chicago"" which look like other more well known fonts. And it is also why you get 250 'free' fonts where the 'i' character has the dot hinted slightly higher but is otherwise identical to some Bitstream font. Historically copyright has been offered on the 'end' product, not on the 'intermediate' product. So you can copyright a game that is written in language X, but not language X. For the language you can only copyright the name, and the implementation. If the new implementation is different (or derived cleanly) you don't have an recourse.<p>This defense of a 'clean' implementation of a specification severing rights to the original has been litigated extensively in the 80's BIOS wars where IBM published the source code to its BIOS in their technical manuals and then started trying to sue clone makers who re-used the source. Once the BIOS was implemented in a 'clean room' where team A (who had the BIOS code) provided specifications to team B who didn't, then you could completely sever the rights to the code from IBM.",1334871032

The feeds themselves can contain ads, there's the compromise of abstracted posts in feeds, and then there's the distinct possibility that users who are proficient enough to use RSS also have something like AdBlock installed. Personally, I see more ads in feeds than on actual sites, due to dedicated feed readers not blocking ads, and the relative low level of annoyance doesn't prompt me to use a filtering proxy for that - never mind that I could on mobile devices",1334870929

The phenomenon of runaway demand by a 'new class' of investors/investments has always been the hallmark of bubbles. 1920s a real national stock market with almost instant communication, now 'anyone' could trade stocks. This created a demand for stocks, so a demand for companies that listed as stocks. The 1960s, aka the go-go years. This bubble was around the conglomerate instrument.  Some conglomerates did well, so everyone wanted to invest in the 'new' thing conglomerates. 1980s. Junk Bonds, or high-yield debt as we call it now. New financial instrument initially does well, demand soars. 1990s, internet companies.  Recognition that the internet is going to change the world, everyone wants to own a stock in internet companies, a ton of crappy IPOs. 2000s, market conditions ripe for housing bubble. late 2000s, stat-arb blows up ( for unrelated to stat-arb reasons ) due to over-reliance on new financial vehicles. 2010s, being an 'angel' is easier than ever, and who wants to miss out on the next google/facebook.<p>Make no mistake, there is a bubble in early stage companies/financing. What is driving it is the same. runaway demand.  This particular bubble is different than the last, because the primary implication of the last has not yet been absorbed.  The regulatory structure for raising capitol and 'exiting' has not caught up to a simple reality. New technology displaces old technology faster than regulated exits can be executed.

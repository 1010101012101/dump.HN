For as long as there's been currency, people have been paying to be entertained. This trend is only getting stronger with each passing decade, as technological improvements give us more free time to kill, and as the Earth's population grows. It's hardly a ""silly"" industry to be involved in as a business. As for innovation, just stop and consider the fact that the average social media gamers is a middle-aged woman[1]. Compare entertainment today to how it was 10 years ago, and you'll realize Zynga (well, the companies it steals from) innovates quite a bit.<p>Facebook and Twitter are less about entertainment and more about communication. Facebook lets me communicate and ""share"" with the people who've come and gone in my life in a way that's never been possible. And for those who use it well, Twitter is an invaluable source of relevant up-to-date information, straight from the mouths of the experts/authorities that you respect. As far as transforming the world goes, communication is a MAJOR area to innovate in, because it tends to bring people close together who were once far away and alien. This has profound effects on culture, government, etc (see: telegraph, radio, telephone, television, etc).<p>The way I see it, the web is a naturally advantageous platform for innovation in these industries and more, and now it's finally maturing. The startups blowing up today are merely the ones taking advantage of this fact.<p>[1] <a href=""http://gigaom.com/2010/02/17/average-social-gamer-is-a-43-year-old-woman/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gigaom.com/2010/02/17/average-social-gamer-is-a-43-ye...</a>",1285541078

This is because they already know how to program and are often inculcated with enormously broad knowledge of CS as compared with their peers.<p>Many of them also know dangerous portions of typical second-year subjects - e.g. just enough to regard their second-year algorithms or operating systems courses as 'oh, this is just like first year, I know this'. Unfortunately, this often refers to the first 20-25% of the course, not all of it, and maybe not even that.<p>Some of them never quite seem to recover and start regarding the marks they get as arbitrary personal judgements of their character ('you gave me a bad mark because I'm smarter than you and you hate me') or as failings in the system ('you gave me a bad mark because this course is in ML and ML is stupid').<p>Naturally none of this is helped by the fact that there are copious actual failings in the system.

It's essentially Facebook+Zynga combined.  Many of the top games on Facebook are ports of popular Chinese games, e.g., the farming genre.  Tencent has been around for 12 years and did over $1Bn in revenue in 2009, representing a 61% increase in profits.<p>2. Over 500MM people use Facebook every month.  That demand doesn't just disappear.  The only way Facebook is going to lose is if someone comes along and gives people something better to do with their time.<p>3. Facebook has their pick of engineering talent in Silicon Valley.  If you're an engineer looking ad a mid-sized startup, Facebook is the best place to work, hands down.  Look at their open source projects (e.g., Cassandra.).  How about their PHP compiler?  Or their numerous patches to memcache?  It's clearly an engineering-driven company.<p>4. Just because you think something is frivolous doesn't mean it isn't valuable.  Was Atari frivolous?  Electronic Arts?  EA, obviously, is still around and immensely profitable.  Moreover, the same VC that backed those companies also backed Apple, Oracle, and NVIDIA.<p>There are plenty of startups working on problems lower on the stack.  One can innovate at any level -- why is Minecraft any less valuable than a video game that pushes the limits of modern 3D algorithms?<p>Was Facebook less innovative than PayPal?  Oracle?<p>Personally, I think the attitude you show in your response is a defense mechanism.  You feel like you're somehow ""above"" Facebook and therefore their success isn't valid.",1285540104

Let's say that you are writing the Mint.com killer, and you want to fetch a user's portfolio and query a bunch of 3rd party systems (Yahoo finance, whatever) for stuff related to individual holdings.  Let's say you have a table of holdings (security symbol as business key) along with a related set of buy/sell records for each holding.<p>Let's say that, there a 5% chance that there's something interesting found from the 3rd party systems which requires the buy/sell history for evaluation (capital gains tax-related?  I'm just contriving an example here).  One strategy would be to do a big join fetch of the holdings and history table.  This would be efficient from a DB perspective if you would eventually require a high enough percentage of the history records.  But, if you only require a small fraction of them, then it would be better to lazily initialize the history set on a per-portfolio basis.  The exact percentage at which you would be indifferent between strategies from a performance perspective would probably be dependent on so many things that you'd have to just experiment with both fetch plans.<p>Unless an ORM tool is smart enough to observe code execution paths over time, profile them, and dynamically adjust fetch plans accordingly (a cool idea?), the ORM client code has to be able to specify the strategy it thinks is optimal.<p>Granularity becomes important when doing batch-y stuff.  Throughput is significantly higher when you select or insert records by the thousands instead of individually.  However, you do take a big memory hit because you're keeping thousands of records around at once.  So, if using table X for some batch activity running in only one thread of your application, it's probably best to use coarse grained fetching.  However, if you're reading/writing as part of user transactions and are concerned about allocation/deallocation, record-by-record processing might be better.  My knowledge of DB internals is too weak to discuss the trade-offs in the db of fetch granularity decisions.",1285539054

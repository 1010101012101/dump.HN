1403001,comment,1401871,1402901,0,0,KirinDave,,,"> Didn't the person writing this need to know about MyIntHolder?<p>Yes, but they wrote it much later. The library writer only wrote the protocol and coded to the protocol. Your function method is not extensible unless you totally re-implement this mechanism (effectively re-implementing single dispatch). If your question is, ""Why can't I get this effect in Python?"" then of course you can, but you're basically implementing this feature, and all that entails.<p>The reason I mentioned monkey patching is to point out how powerful and seductive mechanisms that allow for unforeseen modifications to existing behaviors can be. Clojure provides a fast, well-designed system right out of the box for handling these situations succinctly. Unlike existing methods which are error prone or tedious (monkey patching and retooling dispatch every time, as in your approach), this is elegant and trivial.<p>> I understand that Clojure does this under the covers with great speed, but is that the only benefit?<p>Clojure provides one mechanism that can work two ways. Firstly it can provide flexible specifications where code can interface in a functional way, even across library and time boundaries. Secondly it can induct pre-existing types into a behavior pattern without causing a (potentially destructive) ripple effect in existing code.<p>> But what is ""x"" there? I'm probably reading it too literally, but I see that MyIntHolder takes 1 value (of type int). I don't see any name associated with it, is the ""x"" just an unrelated example?<p>Ahh, it was meant to be "".data"". Sorry, there was a version mismatch between two iterations of the code when I was posting. Thank you for catching it, it has been corrected.",1275608419

They dispatch only on the type of the first parameter, and they do it quickly.<p>This speed is important because it allows the java interfaces that define the core constructs of Clojure (such as clojure.lang.IFn, clojure.lang.Seqable, etc.) to be defined purely in terms of protocols, thus bypassing the need for Java altogether.  Using multimethods would have been untenably slow.<p>Protocols can also be useful in that they recognize that certain behavior is defined by a set of functions, rather than just one.  Consider the Cantor library (<a href=""http://github.com/ztellman/cantor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/ztellman/cantor</a>), which does simple floating point math.  Using only multimethods, it's possible that you could define addition for a type, but not subtraction.  With protocols, it's much more difficult to make that mistake.",1275608209

In SEO, I think the biggest problem is a lack of respect for the audience. That's why you get sites with poor usability, as described by throwaway123 below. But it's not always the SEOs who are responsible for that. Remember, they're being paid by someone. Yes, there are times when the SEO's client DOESN'T understand the impact of the SEO they're commissioning. But there are also times when they do. It's easy to blame the practitioners here, and often that blame is justified. But we only have to look around us to remember that business -- big or small -- is generally far more interested in short term gain than long term customer satisfaction. So it should come as no surprise that many businesses are prepared to turn a blind eye to practices that hinder usability and visitor value.<p>The other common problem in SEO is ineptitude. Many people call themselves SEOs when really they're just opportunistic freelancers and entrepreneurs. Their SEO knowledge is poor and their business management skills lacking.

I want to reiterate that I'm merely confused here and not trying to argue my silly function with type check is good code.  I still feel like something about types/protocols isn't clicking in my brain.<p>What's the difference between extending a protocol including make-hash and human-readable-hash for MyIntHolder and doing two defmethods that define those and are dispatched on an instance of MyIntHolder?  (Sorry if my Clojure lingo is off there, I hope this makes sense)<p>> How, exactly, would I as a BloomFilter writer know about MyIntHolder in order to put it in that conditional?<p>Didn't the person writing this need to know about MyIntHolder?<p><pre><code>  (extend-protocol BloomFilterable\n    MyIntHolder\n    ...\n</code></pre>\n> It's like saying ""this.x""<p>But what is ""x"" there?  I'm probably reading it too literally, but I see that MyIntHolder takes 1 value (of type  int).  I don't see any name associated with it, is the ""x"" just an unrelated example?",1275606159

First of all, i'm sure it has problems. Probably many. However, bonus systems all have problems. The traditional top down, performance review style bonus system definitely works best for the extroverts. From what i've seen of unicorn, the people who are most rewarded are the quiet but helpful kinds.<p>Also, if unicorn helps to get people into the habit of sharing their accomplishments with their friends and coworkers then I think that's worth it all by itself. You have to share your accomplishments. Everyone loves to work with people who do great stuff. But if those people don't tell you about the great stuff they do then you cannot know about it and you cannot partake.",1275606097

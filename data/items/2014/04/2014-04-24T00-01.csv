After eight months of work, I could count the number of positive remarks about my work that I had received on one hand with fingers to spare.

7637932,comment,7634565,7634920,1,0,ahulak,,,"Before I offer any critical feedback, I want to first say that the first line of code I ever wrote, my &quot;Hello world&quot;, was on Codecademy almost immediately after you launched.  Since then I&#x27;ve learned how to use programming not only at my job (as a product manager at a web startup), but also to develop full web apps using several of the popular frameworks (flask, django, rails).  I credit Codecademy for breaking down the initial barrier to entry (what is control flow, how do you tell a computer what to do, etc).  I am a huge fan, but I think there are a few ways you guys could improve.<p>1) Put the courses into perspective as part of the onboarding process.  Why do I need to learn HTML, CSS, JS, or Python?  Most people who want to learn have no clue how everything fits together.  If you can provide a high level guide as to how and why someone should work through specific codecademy courses you will likely increase satisfaction and completion of courses (just a hypothesis, but this is the most common criticism I hear).<p>2) I wish codecademy would cover database basics.  What is SQL? How should you think about storing data?  Until I started researching outside of Codecademy it hadn&#x27;t even occurred to me that storing and structuring data was a huge part of creating useful applications (I was totally nontechnical).  This is the largest hole in terms of actual content.<p>3) Your classes are already great at teaching newbies the syntax.  The big missing component (as some have pointed out), is turning this syntax into real world solutions for real world problems.  How do you get past this? You have to break into an area that you aren&#x27;t comfortable in: Content Production.  Unless you can come up with a way to show people how to create and run scripts on their local computer (or maybe a remote server?) through the browser this will continue to be a pitfall of the Codecademy experience.  There is probably the potential for you to create some new software that does this (maybe a desktop app), but if you took a codeschool or treehouse approach, only for this stage of the learning, you would be able to truly offer an end to end solution.  In your case video content scales just as well as the software. If you were to combine your superior browser interface with high quality video production you would be in a fantastic position to win the &quot;Learn to code online&quot; market.  This sets you up with not only a differentiated product offering (your interface is the best), but a future revenue stream.  Both of the aforementioned companies are making some serious cash... And thats without even mentioned the real juggernaut (Lynda).<p>Overall I love the product and think there is a lot of potential.  If you have any questions or any of my points require clarification please feel free to shoot me an email (in profile).<p>Best of luck!",1398300823

Perhaps you might find it useful.<p>After some experience, I think the biggest pain point in Haskell&#x27;s syntax is that it is very light on keywords so many things that would show up as syntax errors in other languages might show up as type errors in Haskell. For example, forgetting a comma in a list will result in a function application between the two list elements instead of a syntax error.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.ezyang.com/2011/11/how-to-read-haskell/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.ezyang.com/2011/11/how-to-read-haskell/</a>",1398300617

Some of that expresses itself internally: There’s a lot of information sharing and support for professional development.<p>I think one of the great practical advantages is that it’s a structure without employee numbers.

Patented 3Drsr is closing the gap between 3D Printing & mass manufacturing for hollow structural parts. 3D Rapid Structural Replication allows us to produce parts not possible with injection molding. In the case of the Rodin Wheels, injection molding cannot produce a seamless hollow wheel with hook bead rim, internal ribbing and variable wall thickness where needed to counter stress. 3D Printing can reproduce the wheel in the same complex form but they are not nearly structural enough, took 32 hours each to build on the FDM printer and ended up costing about $3,000 ea. In contrast 3Drsr will produce, under high temp and pressure the otherwise impossible complex fully structural wheel in under 5 mins for less than $200 each during the Kickstarter campaign. \nAlso it really isn&#x27;t BS that as the composite material cools it forms and aligns in interlocking chains that make the final cooled part want to hold the solidified state. \nAs for the tooling time, we are not planning on employing rapid tooling techniques which we would normally do for more reasonable sized parts.

7637791,comment,7637278,7637514,18,0,sparkie,,,"The plain Haskell language, without extensions, has a pretty small and trivial syntax. The Haskell report describes it in approx 250 lines[<a href=""http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/syntax-iso.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/syntax-iso.html</a>]. Admittedly, the syntax can be overwhelming when multiple extensions are involved because there is no single resource which explains them all in full as succinctly as the report.<p>The difficulty one might find comprehending Haskell is probably because of the semantics rather than syntax - particularly if you have a background in languages like C++ and Java - the first thing you&#x27;ll be attempting to do is find parallels between this new obscure syntax and what you already know - but they don&#x27;t necessarily fit, because the language is fundamentally different.<p>A common example of misunderstanding for beginners is function signatures - in Haskell, one simply defines a function name, followed by two colons, followed by a type declaration which states the function&#x27;s type. It&#x27;s as simple as<p><pre><code>    add :: Int -> Int -> Int\n</code></pre>\nIf you&#x27;re attempting to draw the parallel to the equivalent in another language such as C#, you might think this is the same as<p><pre><code>    int Add(int a, int b) {\n       ...\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWhile pretty close, the Haskell equivalent of that is really a coupled argument.<p><pre><code>    add :: (Int, Int) -> Int\n</code></pre>\nThe C# equivalent of the original is closer to this<p><pre><code>    Func<int, Func<int, int>> add = a => (b => ...);\n</code></pre>\nAt this point it should become a bit more obvious why that &quot;cryptic&quot; function signature is the way it is - it&#x27;s because all functions in Haskell are secretly single argument functions, and additional arrows indicate that the return type is another function. In other words, the arrow, -> associates to the right, which makes it unnecessary to parenthesize the returned functions - but you can optionally write them for clarity:<p><pre><code>    add :: Int -> (Int -> Int)\n</code></pre>\nAs a result, you can partially apply add with a single value, e.g. `add 5`, and a valid function which adds 5 to its argument is returned, e.g. `(add 5) 6 == 11`, and because function application (denoted by a space) associates to the left, you can omit the parens and simply say `add 5 6`.<p>Given that you have some Erlang background, the syntax for implementing functions should not be foreign to you, because they&#x27;re quite similar, except perhaps &quot;do-notation&quot;, which will won&#x27;t be very intuitive until you grok monads.",1398298424

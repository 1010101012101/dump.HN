And self understanding can help avoid some of the counter productive if not destructive advice that comes from the ""mainstream"".<p>It may sound like obligatory appeasement, but the ""different not better"" language really does come to apply to one's understanding as one ages.  Particularly if you've not been successful, and observe those around you who were once a bit in awe of what you could do, having successful lives (in your own eyes) while you continue to flounder from one poor fit to the next.<p>If I'd known then, what I know now, I could have made some better choices.  I feel I've squandered a lot of what I have to offer.  I'm most happy when I am truly helping others, but the course I've ended up on has left me largely at odds with one poor fit after another, wherein I largely end up making everyone miserable.<p>Just by way of explanation, for myself I've taken some damage along the way that makes it hard to just change (the discomfort is very distracting; also, I need to maintain group health care coverage).  I hope that messages like this will reach those who are like me, so that they might avoid forcing themselves into roles that promote such damage, physical and/or mental.<p>Life's just plain not easy, for many, and there are no guarantees.  I can only say that, for myself, as I've learned more about my own personality and how it does and does not fit into the world, I've become better able to cope.  The author is describing a group of people who are very bright, but who also (in my case, at least) have a strong need for a social connection.  Knowledge like this can better enable them to approach that on their own terms, and perhaps to then be happy with the results.",1219934577

Maybe all IT consultants are ethical, too, but many are still clueless. Still, they manage to find their customers, and they are in high demand, too. Are lawyers in general less clueless?<p>I must admit that it often freaks me out to consider that other professions are just as messed up as the software world. For example, in medicine there is in all likelihood an equivalent to LISP and an equivalent to Java.

289142,comment,288901,289037,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Perhaps I've made it sound more dramatic than it should be.  It is, as in all things, a spectrum of possibilities, not a black and white thing.  That said, there's a type of person that becomes a hacker.  While it is a choice, just like being an athlete or a musician, it's also a temperament that not all people possess.  So, one might enjoy technology and find it useful to understand it, or one might find it to be the most satisfying and interesting thing to spend time on--and this, I believe, is a trait exhibited very early.<p>I don't, of course, think only the latter should be ""allowed"" to write code or make a living with technology (nearly everyone will be a knowledge worker in the coming years, so no one can avoid it).  I just think they tend to be the ones producing the code that runs the Internet and everything else of real interest in the technology world.  It's just such a deep subject that one really has to love it to have any chance of being seriously productive in the field.  So, while I believe one can learn to play a musical instrument as an adult, if you aren't passionate enough about it to spend many hours each day on it (and not in a hardcore slamming your fingers down on the keyboard one more time...just in the sense of always learning about the subject and always expanding your horizons), you probably won't be a great musician.  It doesn't make it any less valid a pursuit--as long as you derive pleasure from the time you spend with it, it's a productive use of time.  Likewise hacking...but you probably won't produce work of significant note without a pretty strong drive to do so.<p>So, I guess I should make clear that I don't believe any talent is natural (excepting a few prodigies, perhaps) or inborn, certain traits are.  And there are traits that are deeply ingrained that just make a big difference in whether one will enjoy the hacking process.  Also note that I'm not claiming to be particularly far down that spectrum, or to have produced any significant work in the field.  I was both a computer nerd and a music nerd very early in life, and I didn't choose to focus almost completely on technology until my mid-twenties.",1219934055

289132,comment,288991,288991,0,0,brentr,,,"I think the point is: the more you learn, the more you realize how much you don't know.<p>I present an example from personal experience. It's not so much that I didn't know the concept being discussed, but rather the example I will present was used to kick off my real analysis class three days ago.<p>Consider a number, B (B for bad). Let B be the limit of the alternating harmonic series as the number of terms approaches infinity. The professor showed by merely switching the location of parentheses and rearranging terms that this same series can be shown to sum to 1.5B. Naturally, the number B, the limit, approaches ln 2. But by rearranging the terms, he showed otherwise. The point of the lecture was to show that the human mind, unless trained in the concept of limits at infinity, falls short. Now I know the reason why he was able to prove this was due to a result of Riemann, specifically that conditionally convergent series can be made to sum to anything you want by rearranging the terms in a sufficient manner (see Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis for a proof), much of the class was stumped as to why this occurred. Just when you think you have mastered something as beautiful as the calculus, when you start to dig deeper into the theoretical underpinnings of it, you realize that there is so much more to learn.",1219933231

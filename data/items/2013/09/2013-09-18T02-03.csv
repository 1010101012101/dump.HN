It&#x27;s not uncommon for queries with millions of variables and clauses to be solved in a matter of seconds. There are some algorithmic tricks combined with clever data structures and search space exploration heuristics that make this possible.<p>btw, if you&#x27;re curious about the workings of a modern SAT solver, the first few sections of this paper: <a href=""http://www.georg.weissenbacher.name/papers/mod12.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.georg.weissenbacher.name/papers/mod12.pdf</a> should make interesting and hopefully accessible reading.<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t know enough about the internals of Z3 to know what specifically makes it the fastest SMT solver. But I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too far wrong to say that SMT solvers like Z3 are fast because the underlying SAT solver they use is very fast.",1379471766

Yet I feel at some point in time we need to consider opportunity cost and externalities:<p>-Assuming that I have finite time and I derive similar amounts of joy playing video games and tabletop games, do I spend time grouping with old college roomies on Halo and shoot aliens, or do I try to coordinate a time with 4 other busy professionals, drive across town, grab some snacks, and roleplay some Call of Cthulhu on a weekly basis?  Or maybe I hang out with some buddies at TechShop and we build a robot that uses facial recognition to launch whiskey shots at people?<p>-If I wanted to enjoy a narrative, do I allocate three hours, send an FB blast for movie buddies, and spend $15 sitting in a dark room with others watching a common story, or do I allocate 20-30 hours over a few days to experience the story of GTA V?  Or do I pick up a book and spend a day to let my imagination take me to Westeros or Battle School?<p>-If I wanted to enjoy some music, do I play some Guitar Hero and press some controller buttons?  Or join a structured choir?  Or pick up some social dancing (a co-op music game with a social externality, essentially)?<p>I think gaming is FANTASTIC as an efficient way to get quick jollies, with a low barrier to entry as well as high skill requirement for advanced levels; MOBAs such as League of Legends or shooters such as Call of Duty come to mind for &quot;gaming as a skill&quot;.  However, I do think other activities such as swimming, cooking, biking, amongst others, provide different externalities.  And for some people these things are just better in the long run.<p>PS -- I&#x27;ve had a long history of gaming since the NES came out and love it.  It&#x27;s just that personally I find it harder to manage and regulate my gaming consumption (attention span and time are the main caps) vs other activities, and I also feel that I&#x27;ve had less to show for as a gamer of twenty years (did the semipro Starcraft thing for a bit but not much more) than as a concert violinist of ten, or salsa dancer for five; so on and so forth.<p>That being said, the analytical mindset of optimizing resources given victory conditions in games probably was the main reason how I ended up being a data scientist.

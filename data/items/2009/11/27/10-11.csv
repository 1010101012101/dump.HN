But I don't think that much really changes here -- instead of signing a traditional contract with a publisher, the authors make new ones with Amazon, who is actually a new kind of publisher.<p>Just like traditional publishers, Amazon has a vested interest in the success of your book (the more you sell the more they earn), so they do (or will do) all the things that traditional publishers used to do in terms of promotion and marketing, except that they have the tools and technologies allowing them to be more efficient and handle more titles and authors simultaneously.<p>Also, they own the platform at this point, but this will change in time (Kindle is a great product, but others will soon follow). We've seen it all before when there was a monopoly (medieval monks) of the platform, but the underlying standard (latin alphabet) was open and new technology (printing press) allowed others to produce more final products. And the effect was that the publishers appeared as middlemen between creation and production.<p>So yes, the printed books are going the way of the dodo, just like previous technologies which were replaced by better alternatives, like steam engines, CRT monitors or black records. But the business model remains the same, and as always only those players who can adapt will survive; so there isn't much of a revolution here.",1259319580

963714,comment,963577,963577,0,0,stingraycharles,,,"Well that seems kind of obvious: Amazon customers already are a very specific subset of all the book sales, and I bet they are far more willing to read an ebook than the average book reader.<p>For an article that promises the death of the printed book, I do find it strange that it almost solely focuses on the increase of ebook sales, rather than the decline of print sales. Could there perhaps be a new audience of people who would only read ebooks and no print editions? The only real information provided about this in the article seems to be a quote from an author who assesses he will earn more from ebooks than from print sales in 6 years time, but this is just one example and can depend upon the audience of the author: I bet ebooks will do better for SF fiction than ancient history literature.",1259319351

Someone posts Yegge's ""I hate Perl"" article.  Three or four clever souls post something like, ""I ditched Perl 100 years ago and never looked back"".  Then chromatic comes along and says something not-negative about Perl, and someone else asks him for conclusive proof.<p>Anyway, I can't find words intense enough to describe how I am feeling right now, but it seriously disturbs me.  It feels like the Universe is recursing on itself, and I am in two of the Universes at the same time.  I had to check the date on the comment three times before I believed that it was real.

At a former company it let us collect, parse, store, audit, and make predictions against millions of web hits per day, in close to real time, with cheap infrastructure.  Perl has been solidly stable - it just runs - keeping our ecommerce infrastructure making money.<p>It has had few security issues over the years.  It has had few backwards incompatibilities between versions over the years.  As a component of our products, it's given me relatively little pain in performance, reliability and security.\nDevelopment wise, I can't count the amount of time we've saved over the years thanks to not having to reimplement something because it's on CPAN, with a sensible license, with doumentation, tests, and in an easy to find and search location.  As for code quality, Perl has great support for testing, support for automating code review (Perl::Critic), and a community of developers that are constantly making things better - but without breaking things that worked in the past (Moose has done amazing things for refactoring ugly OOP code, and you can use it with any of the other older OOP stuff).<p>I use it because it works well, seldom breaks, and causes me less hassle than anything else I've tried (C, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby).  I've spent serious time with this language; I've maintained ugly old code from 10 years ago, and giant million++ line projects written in it.  It has warts, sure, but what doesn't? I don't care; it's reliable.  Big jobs, little jobs - it gets the job done.  And that, to me, is more important than high minded ideals about aesthetics and purity.",1259318444

Since buying my Kindle I have bought 22 novels, 20 of them on the Kindle.<p>(And if they had trashy Japanese sci-fi available I would have gotten the other two on it, too.)<p>I've also bought a LOT more books from new authors than I usually would have, since a) it doesn't threaten to waste my trip to the bookstore and b) ""First book in the series is free"" is freaking genius and should be written into the standard contract for all sci-fi and fantasy authors (who live and die on selling the same people 1+ copies of every book of each series they are following).<p>While we're at it, can we drag authors/publishers kicking and screaming into Internet marketing?

Agile is against Big Design Up Front as a matter of course because it so often fails to be good design, or appropriate for what the business ends up wanting.<p>* Lots of automated tests done while coding that allows you to think sooner and better about your code. decreasing the need for big design up front, and better suiting the design to what you actually find your needs to be. Not thinking beforehand is a risk for sure, but producing a big, inflexible, unsuitable design is another risk. I've seen it, you may have too. Thinking without testing the thoughts in code is bad too.<p>* ""Tests after the fact"" refers to QA. Agile also emphasises unit tests before and during the fact. ""Tests after the fact don't do enough to lower the number of bugs"" is something that any agilist would agree with, but would recognise as an argument <i>for</i> agile.<p>* Rapid release to QA allows actual users/sysops to see where you're going much earlier, hence mitigating major risk of building the wrong thing/right thing but not scalable/performant enough/etc.",1259317794

One blog shows the opinion of one blogger; nothing more.  Amazingly, ""the Perl community"" does not have one single voice, as it consists of tens of thousands of people all over the world.<p>(Also, if blog noise was a good measure of langauge popularity, it would be clear that the most popular programming language right now is Go.)<p><i>Believe me, if people wanted to pay attention to your project, they would find a way to do so. And if your project is being politely but firmly ignored, and you're not getting the message, it is not the audience's problem. They've responded to your message. That response is somehow not getting through to you.</i><p>One thing I've learned from social news sites is that this is not correct.  People mostly want to find ways to justify their insecurities.  If they don't know very much about programming, but pick language X, they will hang around people that like language X and that say good things about language X.  Then they feel smart by association, and since they have lots of friends saying lots of good things about language X, they can feel good for ""making the right decision"".  Being down on language Y and language Z also help reinforce that feeling.  If language X is unpopular, then they're clearly in the so-much-smarter-than-everyone-else majority.  If language X is popular, then it's clear that it's the best.  If it weren't good, why would it have so many users?<p>And so on.<p>These are not technical arguments, they are just emotion.

All of that criticism has resulted in many major changes in how people use Perl, such that the criticism is probably no longer valid.<p>But of course, people like to recycle that criticism because They Picked Something Else, and drunken rants from five years ago make them believe that Something Else is the right choice.<p>(I am not sure how valid it was five years ago, actually.  It was more a criticism of Amazon's hiring practices, or perhaps a note about how poorly managed the programmers were.

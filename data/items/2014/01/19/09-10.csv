It&#x27;s then that they quickly come up with a large con list to warrant an upgrade. Afterwards, they will almost always say that last car was never any good. After all look at the current car vs. the con list of the last. The thing is, they&#x27;ll be doing this again with their new car until they outgrow it or find problems with it too.<p>And my point is: Hindsight is always 20/20 when your current perspective <i>conveniently</i> matches the narrative for your newly made situation.",1390125421

We even touched infinite series at the end of high school.\nThen at univ we had some trigonometry again but not much, some infinite series and stuff.<p>Nowhere along the way I was shown that sine is actually how high above the ground you are when traveling around the circle. It was always some length of side in right triangle divided by length of another side. That was technically the same thing but nowhere close as intuitive and natural.  \nEven when at some point I got interested in math and start thinking about sine as y coordinate it was always in relation to angle of a triangle (rooted in the center of the circle, one point at radius, the other at x axis below it) and not in relation of actual distance traveled along the circle. At some point radians appeared and we were just taught that&#x27;s other way to measure angles, so you know: 0 degrees is 0, 90 degrees is 1/2 of PI and 360 degrees is 2 PI. I thought it was kinda weird to this that way but w/e probably people have their reasons...<p>The concept is so beautiful and natural yet it was made as artificial as possible during math education I had.\nNo wonder so many kids don&#x27;t get or like math :(",1390124746

The Family Courts routinely operate in secret with it being a criminal offence to report on their activities or even any of the people involved.  Recent examples are a woman who was sentenced to prison in absentia for taking her father out a care home to go on holiday - she was arrested on her return and taken straight to prison as she had already been sentenced to 5 months.  It was a further offence for her to even tell people /why/ she was in prison !<p>Only after diplomatic intervention was an Italian woman able to reveal one of these secret courts had forced a cesarian on her and the removal of her baby after she had been treated for depression.  Social workers used the secret courts to sieze the child and then to try and prevent her publicising the injustice.

The link is even given at the bottom of the page.<p>This reported statement, the Bitcoin isn&#x27;t legal tender, has a very specific meaning. It says that people are not required to accept Bitcoin as a form of debt. This report should not be shocking or at all surprising.<p>While the details depend on the jurisdiction, &quot;legal tender&quot; is usually defined as a medium of payment which is valid for discharging debt. Other forms of payment, like checks and credit cards, are <i>not</i> legal tender but widely accepted. This being Canada, scrip like Canadian Tire money (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Tire_money"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Tire_money</a> ) is also not legal tender, even if people other than Canadian Tire accept it a a form of payment.<p>For that matter, the US dollar is not legal tender in Canada, even if some people and places in Canada (especially those at border tourist towns) will accept it as a form of payment.<p>So, Bitcoin isn&#x27;t legal tender in Canada?

Maintenance work sold properly can both have fat margins and be a powerful sales tool, though, so many consultancies offer it.<p>I think you&#x27;re correct that slicing off 30 minutes here and 2 hours there is nearly useless for clients because of the switching costs involved in intellectual work.  You need to reach flow state to do well by them.  So don&#x27;t sell them anything which structurally inhibits flow state.<p>Let&#x27;s say, for the sake of argument, that we&#x27;re mutually skilled, that our core offering is charged by the hour (<i>cough</i> though it would be better for everyone if you switched to daily or weekly rates <i>cough</i>), and that the core offering costs $200 an hour.<p>Here&#x27;s the maintenance contract you sold: &quot;We&#x27;ll do maintenance work on an as-available basis, up to your budget of 20 hours a month.  I&#x27;m not going to carve out preferential scheduling for it, though, so it will be dribs and drabs when the team has downtime.  Maintenance work costs $200 an hour times the number of hours consumed.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s the maintenance contract I&#x27;d sell: &quot;Thanks for investing $200,000 in getting your project completed with us.  You and I both know that, after we deploy this project, you&#x27;re going to discover through your customers&#x27; use of it that we didn&#x27;t anticipate 100% of the stuff you&#x27;ll want.  That&#x27;s totally natural in software.  Tell you what: we&#x27;ll sell you a maintenance contract on the project for $5,000 a month.  We agree to maintain internal expertise about your project and the staffing flexibility to promise you development services in a timely fashion responding to any fixes or feature requests you have, up to 2 days worth per month.  If you need more than that, or if you do not buy the maintenance contract but need help anyhow, we&#x27;re more than willing to listen to a proposal for a new MSA and SOW, subject to our then-prevailing rates and availability.&quot;<p>After I&#x27;ve sold four clients on maintenance contracts, one of my developers is essentially full-time paid for by maintenance, so I will always schedule engagements with one developer hidden behind my back.  (One dev means one full-time equivalent, not necessarily &quot;Hey Bob, you&#x27;re our maintenance engineer, who suffers so all the rest of us can do the fun, intellectually engaging work.&quot;)  They&#x27;re paid for but, crucially, not 100% utilized, which allows me to have a slack-time reserve for e.g. unplanned employee absences, internal projects, or one-off sprints for maintenance customers which are technically in excess of what we&#x27;ve sold them but justified by our desire to delight long-term good customers who probably haven&#x27;t been diligent about using their entire allotment every month.  (Note for people who haven&#x27;t run consultancies: What does a $5,000 a month maintenance contract cost if you don&#x27;t require any work in a given month?  $5,000.  It&#x27;s like health insurance: just because you don&#x27;t have your appendix burst doesn&#x27;t mean we give you a rebate.)",1390123807

Its like the real world but without the limits of the real world.<p>Another interesting effect is memory.  I remember reading somewhere that in ancient times they would memorize lots of data by imagining walking through a house.

It means being On 100% of the time you&#x27;re away. The raw number of hours of being Always On for your company--around the world, with different people in different contexts--creates an emotional distance to one&#x27;s family, because your mental world becomes intensely focused and 100% only on work, and work issues. Product issues, team, management, all that you can balance, but being on the road is the chaos of (enterprise) customers.  They may love you, but they&#x27;re needy.  And all the time you&#x27;re together, you&#x27;re considering every word, and interaction to drive to a preferred outcome. It&#x27;s never a &quot;dinner&quot;.  It&#x27;s part of a never-ending orchestration to achieve specific outcomes.<p>Coming off of /those/ trips, he should have re-engaged with his family, but the challenge is the trips exhaust your mental and (jet lag) physical energy.

7083918,comment,7081757,7081757,3,0,reuven,,,"When I was working at HP, just after graduating from college, the CEO (Lew Platt) announced that he would be stressing work-life balance among employees.  He specifically said that he wanted to accommodate working mothers, and especially single-parent families.  He officially blessed the idea of job sharing (such that two people could each have a part-time job) and flexible hours, to help in that way.<p>The particularly poignant part of this story was that he learned the importance of such flexibility the hard way: His wife died from cancer, and he was left taking care of his children by himself.  Suddenly, he realized how much work it was to raise children, and he decided that HP should try to take into account people&#x27;s personal needs, such that they could be with their families and have jobs.<p>I don&#x27;t know how deep those changes really went, and I don&#x27;t know how many of them have continued until today.  But those announcements and attempts to help people balance their personal and professional lives have stayed with me for about two decades.<p>Sure, I work crazy hours (as a freelancer, and also trying to finish a PhD) -- but part of the reason I work late at night is because I value spending time with my wife and children.  I cringe when I see startups (and other companies) expecting people, explicitly or implicitly, to sacrifice their family time for the sake of the company except in unusual circumstances.  And yet, there&#x27;s no doubt that for many of these companies, success often does demand more than a simple, 40-hour week.<p>I&#x27;m glad that the original author realizes now that he could and should have spent more time with his family.  But I do wonder if he is willing to tell the people working at his startups, &quot;Hey, that program can be debugged tomorrow.  Go home and spend time with your children.  Software can wait, but they can&#x27;t.&quot;",1390122695

That's part of the job of being in R&D, no matter where you stand on the research to development spectrum. One of the reasons companies keep R&D departments is to have people around who are technically knowledgeable _and_ who have the vision to think ahead about where the company should go next.<p>The fact that it's about code quality is an artifact. Yes, as others have pointed out, a question about code may not be so relevant if your candidate is a theorist or will have a role with no development. Still, because most or all candidates will have experience with bad code, and because fewer will have intimate knowledge of the business at hand, it's a better question than ""so, where do you think our company should go in three to five years?""",1241444222

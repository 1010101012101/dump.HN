Not the one known for his singing, and I don't think he's in the best-selling or longest-running band. But it was a different style, and one that at least contains a bit more than sheer endurance (c.f. most growlers).<p>I was surprised at the high marks Dickenson got. Not that I don't hold him in high esteem personally, but he's the only one where I know of a direct connection to opera singing. It must've been a Freddy Mercury tribute, where he sang Bohemian Rhapsody with Montserrat Cabbal√©. And as opposed to her previous duet with Freddy (""Barcelona""), those voices didn't mesh at all.<p>Really nice article, I always thought that trained opera singers tend to look down upon those doing less ""serious"" work.

1628451,comment,1627668,1627881,0,0,ruff,,,"I'm a PM at a large, well known software company.  In fact, I lead a team of PMs and have been in a PM role for several years after running a failed software startup during university and a stint as a sales and marketing guy at a solar start-up.<p>This article does a great job summing it-up: the PM role is about taking the vision, converting it to execution of a strong product, and facilitating a feedback loop that helps drive the vision forward.<p>A lot of times the PM is denigrated as an excess or waste, particularly in start-ups.  It's true that a lot of PMs are taxes to their teams. But good PMs will bring a lot of clarity and absolute focus.  I'm sure strong founders are also very capable of this but it's likely a matter of time and focus for those founders relative to other competing objectives.<p>Tips on doing PM well:<p>- Live. Eat. Breathe your product. I've spent years working on a product that I secretly detested but used that frustration with the product as a motivation to learn the product space inside-out and established myself into a position to remake the product what it needs to succeed (rebranding, significant technical overhaul, slash/dash legacy feature weights, etc.).  Our customers are going from constant complaining to singing praises‚Äîthat's hugely rewarding personally.<p>- Squash out all forms of inefficiency in the team. Every aspect of development that reduces your ability to deliver the best product is a concern.  I'm engaged in everything from the architecture, feature prioritization and scheduling, end user usability and aesthetics, support workflows, license agreements, and key customer account discussions. I coordinated the entire team's shift to agile development practices including deciding the structure of each sub-team (our dev team is quite large and split across different countries)--as the PM for a large team you are in a unique role to see all sorts of opportunities for improvement. But be very careful--don't be shallow in identifying something as inefficient. For example, driving out prototyping time from devs reduces both their morale and creativity, two valuable resources.  Another common mistake, seeing process as efficient‚Ä¶ Creating checklists that engineers spend more time checking-off than delivering value to customers. Bad PMs excel at this.<p>- Software is the output of people and your ability to drive, motivate, and coordinate people is key to their ability to deliver the product.  Process and schedules are mere tools for organizing people, don't let them dominate you, the team, or the product. The best PMs are really good with people and care about the team's success more so than their own because they know that a product and team's success will ultimately be good for their own career.  The role often puts you in a leadership position with the team‚Äîdon't be afraid to lead.<p>- You will constantly straddle the expectations of upper management, peer managers, and the individuals on your team.  Knowing how to balance all of that and communicating appropriately to each set is a really important skill.  Also, be prepared to be honest when the news isn't good--bad PMs will hide things and hope for miracles.  Your job is to help people make the right decisions even if it means you get ripped apart in a couple meetings.<p>- The most important thing to deliver to the team is focus. Get the distractions out of the way and point the direction to the what needs to get done today.  If you're nuanced, you can do this without making it feel burdensome or dictatorial.  The best is building a team and process where the team can answer focus questions themselves.<p>Here's what day:day job entails (these will often change based on the size of the company and the scope of your influence‚Äîas mentioned, I drive a team of PMs for a software product that straddles the consumer/enterprise space:<p>- Meeting with key customers and getting requests/appeasing them around product direction (and knowing when to ignore them or probe deeper about what they really need vs what they are saying)<p>- Working with or sifting through market research about the space to try and forecast the demand for certain features<p>- Driving these requirements into a schedule and managing that schedule with development, often a negotiation between you, development, and management‚Äîthis bullet really underestimates this as often this is what more junior PMs spend a lot of time doing<p>- Bubbling up engineering opportunities that need prioritization and/or could save costs and/or better align your team to future customer opportunities<p>- In larger orgs, coordinating across teams about aligning bigger customer bets and scenarios<p>- Drafting functional specs that range from whiteboard drawings to many-paged docs describing how things will work (totally depends on your ability to communicate, the team you work with, etc)<p>- Driving the overall look-and-feel of your product in alignment with usability, branding, and revenue concerns\n- Making the calls about what hits the quality bar to go in/out a version of the product<p>If you want a good start at understanding some aspects, see Making Things Happen by Scott Berkun (<a href=""http://www.scottberkun.com/books/making-things-happen/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottberkun.com/books/making-things-happen/</a>).",1282607391

He arranges his resonance space to create a shallow snarl without setting up any resistance for his breath"", etc). I've found that, above all, some classical training seems to reinforce this, allowing students to create resonance rather than merely screaming, to avoid straining at the edge of their ranges, and to approach all genres with a strong grasp of basic music skills.

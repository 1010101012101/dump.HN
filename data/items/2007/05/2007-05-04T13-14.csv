I've had it since 2003 and it still runs like a champ, but I am on the road so often that I need something more portable. Maybe the iPhone will offer a decent, albeit basic, workspace.",1178286768

19362,comment,19144,19150,0,0,sethjohn,,,"I agree that the rise of the ""MBA-google"" submission was significant. I've been impressed by the complexity and sophisitcation of the content that suceeds YC news. Such high quality content is diluted on most other social news sites among a lot of ""funny ha ha"" articles.<p>Maybe (probably!) I'm taking this way too seriously, but facile content seems like the biggest enemy of quality on a site like this.<p>Also, nothing against far33d for posting this, it's clear that he saw a level of depth and value in this that I didn't. And it's clear from his other posts and comments that he takes content/value seriously. I just thought this was an interesting case study.",1178286535

Chaotic operating environment -- too many experiments without expectations to justify or measurements to validate them...<p>2. ...which was technically impossible because everyone rolled up into one massive P&L<p>3. Too many battlefield-promoted 'directors' who hadn't actually managed before... none of whom i'd think of as viable mentors<p>...Actually seem to be Google's strong points.  <a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/09/good-agile-bad-agile_27.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/09/good-agile-bad-agile_27.html</a>

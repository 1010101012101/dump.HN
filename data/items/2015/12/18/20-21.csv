It&#x27;s worth noting that $150k is high for Dallas, but not impossible for people with Principal, Fellow, or Chief in their job titles.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that using a flat cost-of-living adjustment both overestimates and underestimates things.<p>The kind of place you&#x27;d likely rent in Plano or Addison would cost ridiculous amounts in NYC, given comparable neighborhood qualities and commutes. You can easily afford to have three, four, or more kids. In NYC, one kid is doable, two is a challenge, three is crazy. From that metric, $150k in DFW sounds awesome.<p>Though if your goal is retirement, maxing out your 401k in NYC is <i>much</i> easier. If you plan on moving to a lower cost-of-living area to retire, or are otherwise looking to hit a certain dollar-figure for some reason (paying for kids to go to college), NYC probably has the edge.

I would repeat it, however, a hundred times, that &#x27;immediate certainty,&#x27; as well as &#x27;absolute knowledge&#x27; and the &#x27;thing in itself,&#x27; involve a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO; we really ought to free ourselves from the misleading significance of words! The people on their part may think that cognition is knowing all about things, but the philosopher must say to himself: &#x27;When I analyze the process that is expressed in the sentence, &#x27;I think,&#x27; I find a whole series of daring assertions, the argumentative proof of which would be difficult, perhaps impossible: for instance, that it is <i>I</i> who think, that there must necessarily be something that thinks, that thinking is an activity and operation on the part of a being who is thought of as a cause, that there is an &#x27;ego,&#x27; and finally, that it is already determined what is to be designated by thinking--that I KNOW what thinking is. For if I had not already decided within myself what it is, by what standard could I determine whether that which is just happening is not perhaps &#x27;willing&#x27; or &#x27;feeling&#x27;? In short, the assertion &#x27;I think,&#x27; assumes that I COMPARE my state at the present moment with other states of myself which I know, in order to determine what it is; on account of this retrospective connection with further &#x27;knowledge,&#x27; it has, at any rate, no immediate certainty for me.&#x27;--In place of the &#x27;immediate certainty&#x27; in which the people may believe in the special case, the philosopher thus finds a series of metaphysical questions presented to him, veritable conscience questions of the intellect, to wit: &#x27;Whence did I get the notion of &#x27;thinking&#x27;? Why do I believe in cause and effect? What gives me the right to speak of an &#x27;ego,&#x27; and even of an &#x27;ego&#x27; as cause, and finally of an &#x27;ego&#x27; as cause of thought?&#x27; He who ventures to answer these metaphysical questions at once by an appeal to a sort of INTUITIVE perception, like the person who says, &#x27;I think, and know that this, at least, is true, actual, and certain&#x27;--will encounter a smile and two notes of interrogation in a philosopher nowadays. &#x27;Sir,&#x27; the philosopher will perhaps give him to understand, &#x27;it is improbable that you are not mistaken, but why should it be the truth?&#x27;&quot;<p>~ Friedrich W. Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil<p>P.S.

I worked for a big bank that did their best to stay six months to a year ahead of other banks on technology.  The marketing folks were constantly coming to us and saying, &quot;Give us cool features that we can sell.&quot;  It was a fun place to work.<p>I also worked for an insurance company that viewed technology as a necessary evil that should be as cheap as possible.  The marketing folks there were constantly complaining about how much time and money the company was wasting on technology.  (Curiously, they also complained that the company&#x27;s technology offerings were hopelessly far behind its competitors.)  It was a miserable experience.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for a job, ask questions about management support and budget priorities.

More important was the profession’s blindness to the very possibility of catastrophic failures in a market economy. During the golden years, financial economists came to believe that markets were inherently stable — indeed, that stocks and other assets were always priced just right.<p>So, I mean, you can argue a Nobel Laureate is so ignorant of his field that you are correct if you want.

Signal to noise is a very real problem that requires a very large level of agreement to move the levers of policy for a reason.<p>> They were ignored because there was substantial financial interests among the powerful interests resting on the perception that things were going to continue going well, and because the top-line economic indicators (which aren&#x27;t particularly good leading indicators, in any case) that the mainstream media likes to look to were strong, so there was a PR effort that was in line with what the media was naturally inclined to follow; the warnings from various different directions were an inconvenience for the interests of the powerful and the comfortable narrative of the media.<p>This is a comforting conspiracy theory but the fact economists, as a class of people, failed to capitalize on this for their own financial gain based on knowing that the public perception was in error ... well, that would imply they failed to predict it in sufficient numbers.<p>> Sure, it proves that it the particular impacts and timing of the impending collapse weren&#x27;t widely expected by market participants. That&#x27;s not inconsistent with a significant number -- not very few -- predicting an imminent and significant downturn to be driven by the collapse of the housing bubble.<p>If many economists predicted a recession on that scale, we would have many rich economists.

As Dr. McHugh observes [2], conventional Psychiatrists &quot;diagnose&quot; their patients&#x27; symptoms, and treat the diagnosis without much concern about the actual causes thereof.<p>One of my girlfriend&#x27;s problems is that she has low energy levels - certainly caused by previous stimulant use, and her body&#x27;s inability to efficiently produce energy (ATP) by burning glucose/fructose. Before she met me, she treated this symptom (low cellular energy levels) by drinking alcohol regularly. Alcohol is an energy-rich molecule, the metabolites of which are easily burned by the insulin-resistant brain cells which have become insulin-resistant. She started drinking a month after starting methadone, a drug which is known to cause sugar cravings.<p>Deciding to quit methadone was easy once she realized that she hated it. But when she lost access to alcohol, her brain went into a sort of &#x27;survival&#x27; mode, which led to her being taken to the hospital [1]...<p>The causes behind my girlfriend&#x27;s condition are fairly obvious to me, having observed her for months now. But the hospital staff had no context for why their patient was acting the way she was, so they just treated her symptoms. The doctors at the inpatient facilities she&#x27;s been at don&#x27;t care about physiology either, they just reach into the pharmacy and try new drugs with the proper label (&quot;anti-depressant&quot;, &quot;anti-psychotic&quot;, &quot;mood-stabilizer&quot; - these are marketing terms, imho). She&#x27;s still exhausted, but at least they&#x27;re giving her the coconut oil capsules I dropped.<p>There is another way. My grandfather, a dentist with an interest in hypnosis, didn&#x27;t remember much of his one class with psychiatrist Milton Erickson, M.D., except that Dr. Erickson was always &quot;bitching&quot; - about having to go to medical school, having to learn anatomy, physiology and pharmacology, etc etc, when all he really wanted to do was hypnosis (this was Dr. Erickson&#x27;s method of conversational hypnosis, applied to an audience of medical professionals). The Erickson Foundation released a really cool documentary [3] last year...<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10639657"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10639657</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/how-psychiatry-lost-its-way/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/how-psychiatry-l...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://wizardofthedesertfilm.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wizardofthedesertfilm.com/</a>",1450470120

Letting the system evolve without rules by exploiting irrationality, letting individuals learn exclusively by mistake is a bad mechanism. His &quot;evolutionary&quot; argument could apply to most rule systems -- do you believe rules are inherently bad? That&#x27;s nonsense imo.<p>The assessing of mistakes and teaching is done by domain experts (rule makers or law makers), who know much better than new entrants the perils of a given system, in the case of a well functioning system. There is also evolution in those systems, but it&#x27;s a more effective form: usually when a <i>single</i> actor finds an exception or flaw in the rules, the rule makers are warned and may rewrite, propagating this knowledge to everyone.<p>If we had infinite capacity to learn, reason and absorb minutiae of the world around us, we wouldn&#x27;t need rules. But if you go, for example, work in a dangerous factory environment, you don&#x27;t want to study about all the systems and every way you could die, or even worse (per the &#x27;naive evolutionary&#x27; suggestion), try yourself going everywhere. You want someone to tell you &quot;You can&#x27;t step outside those lines; when working at this machine, you can&#x27;t put your hand in those places&quot;, because you trust the rule maker has gone through everything and you won&#x27;t walk out missing a limb. Is this &quot;babysitting&quot;? Probably, it&#x27;s still the best way to go about it.<p>That&#x27;s not to say <i>every activity</i> should have strict rules. Rules are good fit in general where the environmental conditions don&#x27;t change very rapidly (in time or across the actors) and where the perils they protect against are sufficient to warrant learning and enforcing the rules in the first place. They remove flexibility for each actor to make it&#x27;s own optimum choice (only relevant when this varies in time or across individuals) and take resources to formulate, teach and enforce.",1450469481

In order to break six figures, you&#x27;ll probably need to work for a tech company (Amazon, Microsoft, etc) and live in the appropriate metropolitan area.  If you&#x27;re not a top productive developer, you&#x27;ll probably be expected to put in 50+ hours a week.  These things all incur a cost to you, the employee, that is partially compensated by the increased salary and benefits.<p>For example, I currently make about $90k.  I interviewed at Microsoft in Redmond and was offered $110k base.  Let&#x27;s call it $130k with bonus.  I declined the offer.  Why?<p>I interviewed for a senior position and was told &quot;we don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re qualified for a senior position, would you like a junior position&quot;?  This is not a problem, except that it communicates to me that expectations will be high for improvement.  Additionally, during the interviews, I inquired, &quot;Does the team generally work 40-hours a week?&quot;  And they said with a disdainful tone, &quot;Well, we do have one person that works 40-hours a week.&quot;  That tells me that I&#x27;ll have to work my butt off for 50+ hours a week.  Additionally, moving from the smaller town I live in to Redmond/Bellevue area will incur a noticeable increase in cost of living (specifically rent/mortgage).<p>So, I go from a pro-rata rate of ~$43/hour to ~$50/hour (a 16% raise, nice but not amazing) but then I have to pay for it with substantially higher cost of living and substantially more stressful workload.  As an aside, this was when stack ranking was still a thing, and my questioning of the team during the interview indicated that it was a internally competitive team, which as a personal thing is disqualifying for me.<p>So if you want a six figure developer position, create a GitHub profile and build some ad-hoc demonstration apps using some interesting modern tools.  But just be aware that, if you&#x27;re not a &quot;top developer&quot; or &quot;rock star&quot;, then six figures often comes with a considerable cost.",1450469403

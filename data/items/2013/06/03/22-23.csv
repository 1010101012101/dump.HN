5816639,comment,5815725,5816375,2,0,danbruc,,,"I am still unable to see the problem. It's your decision if you switch to 4.5 or not. If you have projects targeting 4.0 and are unable to ensure that you code does not hit any of the documented breaking changes or if you are unwilling to take the risk of hitting unknown or undocumented compatibility problems, then don't switch to 4.5. Or take a hybrid solution - develop against 4.5 but test against 4.0.<p>We have deviated quite a bit from the original comment - you can install different Visual Studio (and .NET framework) versions side by side if you have to support legacy projects. There are some case where this will not work - obvious examples are .NET 1.0 not being supported since Vista, .NET 1.1 since Windows 8 - but there are still a lot of cases where this works just fine. If an side by side installation is not possible, you can still just setup up a second machine or a virtual machine for you legacy development needs. Not being able to upgrade Visual Studio because you have to support legacy projects is mostly a non-issue.",1370300317

Everything below is anecdotal, but based on a pretty large sample of engineers and scientists combined with a highly skilled anti-bias corrector.<p>While I agree superficially in many ways with your characterization of engineers on deadlines versus scientists who will explore certain issues more closely, I think there are a number of things wrong with your comment:<p>1) As a scientist I frequently had to deal with the GIL.  A major part of my time was taking C libraries, making SWIG wrappers for them, and using the Python SWIG libraries to do productive science.  Once SWIG-wrapped, a good C library is very quick to do prototyping but it requires close attention and a good understanding of CPython API threading details to ensure your SWIG libraries are safe for other scientists.<p>2) Nor are ""engineers on deadlines"" going to accept the GIL in CPython.  I'm an engineer on deadlines and after 18 years of programming in Python, I've switched to go because frankly, I can't see Python having much of a future anymore.<p>3) Ultimately, engineers and scientists are the same thing.  24% of the time of every scientist is spent coming up with some engineering solution in a hurry so you can get your experiment to work, (the other 75% of the time is spent writing grant proposals begging for money for the engineering and writing papers so that your grant proposals get approved, and 1% actually feeling true scientific inspiration).  The whole ""leisurely"" word you use doesn't apply to how scientists anywhere in the real world work (except perhaps somebody with awesome funding nearing retirement, or perhaps some wealthy citizen-scientist with a home lab).",1370299963

Alcoholism is something people have a very hard time controlling. It's dangerous. It destroys relationships. It destroys lives.<p>Participating in start-ups (as a founder or employee) is not something that's out of your control, despite your description of yourself as a ""type A personality."" It's just not. You do it out of passion. You do it out of a desire to build your own thing and make a more profound dent in the universe (and maybe get a little payday in the process). That's great -- and I respect that. You should be doing it with a sober mind and a clear picture of what you're doing and what your goals are.<p>But when you paint being a start-up founder as being similar to having a drug or alcohol addiction -- as being something that you can't control and that ruins your life. Well, it kind of sounds like whining. Or like you're trying to paint yourself as some kind of martyr to the cause. Like something is being put upon you that's totally out of your control and it's ruining your life. It's not.

Insurers can threaten to remove a hospital from their network if the prices get too high. The hospital doesn't want to risk losing the large stream of sick/injured patients from the insurer, and usually couldn't care less about one person deciding to have surgery else for reasons of cost (edit: see last paragraph).<p>Individuals paying cash (and individuals without insurance) are generally stuck with the ""sticker"" price for care (higher than what private insurers pay, and significantly higher than what medicare pays (medicare basically gets to ""declare"" what they're willing to pay for a given procedure and hospitals generally have to go along with it or they'll lose some/all federal funding)).<p>It's usually very difficult to renegotiate the sticker price without an insurance provider or the government working on your behalf. If it's a time sensitive or life threatening procedure, you'll often have other more pressing action items than haggling over the price. It's even harder to negotiate after the fact, since hospitals make you sign away whatever bargaining rights you may have had before they'll agree to treat you.<p>[edit]<p>Finally, hospitals generate the bulk of their revenue from insured patients. They can and do quote higher prices to uninsured patients, but the fact remains that this is a fairly risky patient pool for the hospital, since many of these patients will sign whatever they need to sign in order to get treatment, despite being completely unable to pay the (relatively huge) prices quoted.<p>Hospitals have incentives to keep this pool as small as possible, and occasionally resort to extreme measures (legal or otherwise) to get rid of these patients [1]. Though the hospitals often aren't able to collect the full price from many of these patients, you would be naive to believe that they won't send collections agencies after you and utterly ruin your credit rating if you find yourself unable to pay.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1646410/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1646410/</a>",1370299086

You're stuck using lightweight but awfully noisy MEMS gyros and accelerometers along with drifty barometers.<p>Plus, there's not enough payload capacity for an off the shelf LIDAR or other long-range depth sensing. That means detecting obstacles needs to be delegated to 2D imagers plus CV algorithms, with some short-range depth sensing. IR ToF like a Kinect 2 or even a grid-based approach like a Kinect 1 might work in a favorable environment, but I wouldn't trust it outdoors even at close range.<p>If I had to build a pizza-delivery drone, I'd use a bottom-facing camera like the AR.Drone does to try to provide a position reference independent of the bad MEMS gear, and I'd use CV algorithms combined with a last-ditch short-range obstacle sensor (like IR or ultrasound) to attempt to avoid obstacles.

That means the threshold for using sum types is pretty high -- which means you end up not using them when you ought to (e.g: error products rather than sums).<p>Sum types <i>would</i> make error handling significantly cleaner, but are not used that way in Go.<p>5.

Ironically, Go also has a type system, and since it is a rather poor one, it is a cage as well.<p>5.1: I'm sorry but this point of yours shows rather extreme ignorance about Haskell.

As an example of a measure of quality: Haskell makes it <i>easy</i> to verify there are no runtime crashes in your program.  Even <i>excellent</i> programmers will not be able to make that guarantee in Python, Java or Go.  This is a pretty <i>huge</i> thing -- having a guarantee of no runtime crashes. The same Haskellers who can give this guarantee for Haskell code would have no hope of giving this guarantee in these other languages.

So far so good, right?  The system is working, about as well as it can.  There is a vocal minority attempting to gather numbers by protesting the actions of an elected official the minority disagrees with.  That sounds like a country I'd like to live in, right?<p>But then the oppression begins, and here is why this got so bad, from what I've just read: out come the tear gas and the riot shields.  This goes from a beautiful process of democracy in action to what we in the US would call a blatant violation of First Amendment Rights (capital F, A and R).  Now you've got a national incident, which grows as the mistreatment grows, and soon it's an international incident that looks a <i>little bit</i> like what many other countries in the area have gone through, which lead to the ending of a government.  But it's not that, because what would you replace this government with?  A democracy?  That's what got them to this point in the first place.<p>So what exactly happens now?  By all rights, Erdoan should remain in office for the remainder of his term.  How can the protesters ask for anything else?  He is, after all, a fairly elected leader of their country.

Those bugs really aren't a big deal, they happen rarely once you're proficient and they are quickly solved on the rare occasion when they do happen.<p>This is simply not true. I don't <i>only</i> work in Haskell. I also work with many colleagues on C and on Python.<p>Virtually <i>every</i> bug in C or Python that we encounter, including ones we have to spend a significant amount of time debugging is a bug that cannot happen in the presence of Haskell's type system.<p>> I'm talking about logic bugs, the kind that your compiler isn't going to find, or even that a ""sufficiently smart compiler"" couldn't find because it's a misunderstanding in the specification that you have to bring back to the product owner for clarification. Or bugs that occur when 2 different services on different machines are treating each other's invariants poorly. Those are the bugs I spend time on.<p>If you had experience with advanced type systems -- your claims here would carry more weight.  People who don't know advanced type systems tend to massively understate their assurance power. For example 2 different communicating services might use ""session types"" to verify that their protocol guarantees invariants. Or maybe the only type-checked programs are ones forced to reject invalid inputs that violate invariants.<p>> I haven't spent any time at all with Haskell, really, but it seems like a poor trade off to have to learn a bunch and engineer things in a way that's more difficult in order to prevent the easiest bugs.<p>They aren't the ""easiest bugs"" at all.<p>For example, consider implementing a Red Black Tree.<p>In Go, imagine you had a bug where you rotate the tree incorrectly, such that you end up with a tree of the wrong depth -- surely you would have considered this a ""logic"" bug. One of the harder bugs that you wouldn't expect to catch with a mere type system.<p>In Haskell, I can write this (lines 27-37):<p><a href=""https://github.com/yairchu/red-black-tree/blob/master/RedBlackTree.hs#L27"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/yairchu/red-black-tree/blob/master/RedBla...</a><p>to specify my red black tree, with <i>type-level enforcement</i> of all of the invariants of the tree.<p>With just these 10 lines, I get a compile-time guarantee that the ~120 lines implementing the tree operations will <i>never</i> violate the tree's invariants.<p>This logic bug simply cannot happen.<p>Learning a bunch of techniques is a one-time investment. After that, you will build better software for the rest of your career. Debugging far fewer bugs for the rest of your career.  How could you possibly reject this trade-off, unless you expect a very short programming career?",1370297691

I think the future will be thousands of compute nodes/workers along with hundreds of service nodes handling millions of simultaneous requests.<p>Functional constructs make such scaling nearly effortless once the practical issues of breaking up work are handled.  Yes, communications has a cost, but there are faster channels available than what are used... and distributing data persistence into redundant, sharded clusters can yield a lot of other benefits.<p>Given, <i>most</i> line of business applications are fine on current hardware... the problem is scaling to 10x or 100x the workload.  You can do this by creating a system that can scale horizontally, or to be more performance oriented with current hardware.  One solution gains you a single generation of increased output... another gets you N scale expansion.<p>I don't think it's just macro parallel tasks... but many-micro tasks that can work within such a system.",1370297337

Occam argues it's worse.<p>You're right that it's nontrivial to start out making something people want, but the value of the advice is to keep you focused when you're being pulled in different directions. If you're unsure how to proceed, default to the path that takes you closer to making something that people want.<p>It's a feature, not a defect, that translating this advice into a specific plan necessitates pondering how to get from your present position to that one.",1370296811

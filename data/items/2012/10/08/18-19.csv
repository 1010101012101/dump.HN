From the first cutaway drawing (<a href=""http://goo.gl/QKOJy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/QKOJy</a>), it appears that the outer disk rotates independently of the main hub--possibly powered by the central turbines forcing air outward to the wing?  It also shows the air in-take port(s) where you would expect outward thrusting air. And, it seems, like the Coanda effect relies on a more spherical shape, as opposed to the very flat sketch shown.

However, I would argue that cell phones have provided a DNS-like solution for the phone number problem.  It's not perfect; people can change phone numbers, and we still have to exchange numbers to be able to call each other, but this is somewhat by design.  If there was a DNS for phone numbers, which this Sprint StarStar sounds like, it would be too easy for people you don't want calling you to call you (it's already fairly easy... I'm sure Justin Beiber could testify to this).  A phone number is like a crappy, public password for people to call a number that may or may not be associated with you.<p>Just a few thoughts I had based on the last paragraph: the problem is that phone numbers are arbitrary--nothing connects people and the numbers they hold temporarily.  However, a DNS system for individual phone numbers is also suboptimal because it allows everyone access to everyone.  What about a password protected DNS system?  Everyone gets a phone number/ip address and is able to password protect access to it?  Snowball with me here people.",1349721175

The fact that PyPy will dynamically switch from 32-bit to 64-bit to unbounded-long-integer might make a real difference on a 32-bit machine where the code might occasionally require 2048 bits, but overwhelmingly requires just 32 bits.<p>It is possible to construct pathological cases where there are e.g. pow(2,128) possible type combinations within a function, the exact combination is only known from the data (but is consistent for an entire run) - in which case, PyPy will essentially compile the right program to machine code, whereas you cannot do AOT because of the number of combinations; which means a C program will essentially be an interpreter based on those types.<p>But I don't care about theoretically constructed pathologies.

A lot of math teaching is terrible, full of teaching formulas and abstract concepts, instead of the why's and how those abstract concepts relate to real life. A former girlfriend of mine was amazed when I taught her to treat math as something conceptual, rather than memory-based -- that she almost never needed to memorize formulas, that if she understood their meaning, she could usually just derive them on the spot. Her grades suddenly skyrocketed. No teacher had ever explained that to her.<p>2. Math is hard because it is exact. Fuzzy thinking is tolerated, even encouraged, in literature, political science, etc., so people can slide by with a lot less talent. Math doesn't let you do that. So, it's ""harder"", and can take a lot more time to learn.<p>3. Concepts in math build upon each other much more rigorously than in many other disciplines. You can understand the basic concepts of postmodern literary criticism in just a few minutes, without even knowing about medieval criticism. But you can't understand the basic concepts of differential equations without a massive background in mathematical concepts up to that point.<p>So basically, in math there's a ton of stuff (similar to other disciplines) but it's all insanely exact (unlike many other disciplines) and most of the little bits depend on having a solid understanding of all the bits that come before it (unlike many other disciplines).",1349720218

There have been two failures - a non destructive engine shutdown on the previous ISS mission on the pad at T-very_little, and the rather more messy rapid disassembly failure of something near the engine or the engine itself on the most recent launch.<p>So, for this first stage engine the MTBF (remember this is all a bit silly and inaccurate and just for ballpark comparisons with the airline industry) the MTBF has been:<p>9(engines/launch)<i>4(launches)</i>0.05(3 min burns in hours)*0.5(2 failures) = 0.9, i.e. a MTBF of 55 minutes for Merlin 1C lower stage, vs most regulators requiring mtbf > 100000 hours on commercial jet airliner engines.<p>So there's a bit of a way to go yet!",1349719664

4628053,comment,4625365,4627647,1,0,lutusp,,,"> I said that there doesn't need to be a unifying theory for a field to be considered a science.<p>But that's false. All scientific fields have testable, unifying theories -- single theories that all practitioners agree define their field (even if they plan to falsify the theory) -- and that defines them as practitioners.<p>You name the field, and I will tell you the single, unifying theory that defines the field. Only one requirement -- you have to choose a science, not a pseudoscience.<p>> ""One unifying theory"" and ""a field united by theories"" are two different things.<p>Yes -- one describes to the cause, the other describes the effect. Both refer to the requirement that a scientific field be defined by a unifying theory, a theory that makes physics physics, or biology biology. A theory that successfully distinguishes astronomy from astrology. In other words, you're splitting hairs.<p>> You're misrepresenting my words again, even after quoting them.<p>I did nothing of the kind, and I just proved it.<p>> You seem to think that, since theories can be falsified, they have nothing to do with the truth.<p>That is not something I seem to think, that is a fact. Truth cannot be falsified -- that is not how truth is logically defined. A tentative truth is not a truth. A potentially falsifiable truth is not a truth (that's a theory).<p>> The truth is that gravity can be modeled with some equations.<p>This deliberately conflates a statement about gravitational <i>equations</i> with a statement about gravitational <i>theory</i>. If you had instead said ""gravity can be <i>accurately</i> modeled with some equations"" that would be different -- very different. The first makes a factual statement about an equation, the second makes a theoretical statement about physics.<p>> So you don't have a definition of science, you only have disagreement to other definitions?<p>I defined science based on its requirements, requirements accepted by all scientists and granting agencies. Science is even defined in courts of law at times, as in this example:<p><a href=""http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html</a><p>The above legal ruling, meant to keep Creationism out of the classroom, defines science this way:<p>1. It is guided by natural law;<p>2. It has to be explanatory by reference to natural law;<p>3. It is testable against the empirical world;<p>4. Its conclusions are tentative, i.e. are not necessarily the final word; and<p>5. It is falsifiable.<p>So you see, I didn't invent this definition -- it is one on which scientists agree, even those who oppose science on philosophical grounds.<p>>> I never said this, anywhere. Those are not my words.<p>> Then I misunderstood.<p>Misquotations don't arise from misunderstandings, and all such cases can be resolved by using only actual quotations -- by using <i>copy, paste</i> and no creative typing.<p>>> I will know psychology as a field has reached the threshold of science when psychologists courageously propose a central, unifying, falsifiable theory, amenable to practical test that, if it fails, invalidates the entire field.<p>> I completely disagree. They can have two, three, or a hundred theories like that, and still be a science.<p>1. You just declared astrology a science. Congratulations. By your reasoning, astrology is part of astronomy, differing in only a few theoretical details. But to a scientist, astrology is not astronomy <i>because it has a different theory</i>.<p>2. Do you know why cellular biology is not particle physics? Different theories.<p>3. DO you know why particle physics and cosmology are both accepted as part of physics? Same theory.<p>4. Do you know why physics is accepted as a science? It's because all practitioners of physics, from theoreticians to engineers who build bridges, all agree on the single theory that defines what they do, and that defines physics and distinguishes it from other scientific fields as well as unscientific fields.<p>If a doctor claims that shaking a dried gourd over a cold sufferer will eventually make the patient better, and claims the reason is the gourd treatment, he has crafted a theory, but it's not a medical theory -- it contradicts the prevailing theory that defines medicine.<p>The dried-gourd practitioner is excluded from medicine because his theory doesn't conform to the defining theory of the field. That by itself is sufficient reason to have a single theory (there are other equally important reasons).<p>> And then misrepresented the meaning of the words you just quoted, as above.<p>You failed to make your case.<p>> I misunderstood one of your (unfounded) disagreements, hardly an indictment.<p>Your invented quotation wasn't a misunderstanding, it resulted from your unwillingness to quote only my words directly, using the traditional and undemanding <i>copy, paste</i> meme.",1349719483
4628052,comment,4623903,4625893,1,0,kevinnk,,,"""In practice humans do not match automation."" Maybe this is a nitpicky argument, but to me this means one thing: when put head to head, humans do not do better than automated output. This is wrong for exactly the reason I said. In 99% of cases you start out with an unoptimized version, find the areas that need optimizing, and improve the automated output by hand. Thus in practice and in theory humans almost always beat automated output. The general trend of people working on higher level problems isn't because automation can do low level stuff better, it's because automation can do it well enough for most cases that we don't need a human to step in. Automation isn't doing better than what a human would do, but it is doing well enough that there's no need to go back and optimize it.",1349719469

4628048,comment,4627177,4627741,9,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Project Orion was only a waste of money in the short-term. Long-term nuclear pulse propulsion will probably be put to practical use. Potential Earth impacting asteroids are fairly easy to protect against, you spend a lot of effort cataloging them and then you find the ones that could hit Earth 50, 100, even a thousand years in the future and then you go and you nudge those asteroids just enough to put them onto a non-impacting course.<p>But there are also long period comets that come in from the oort cloud. We may never have the technology to fully catalog all those objects (out to thousands of AU up to a light-year distant from the Sun). Which means that even our very much more technologically advanced future selves will almost certainly still be faced with the potential problem of having to intercept and divert an Earth-impacting oort cloud comet that has wandered into the inner Solar System. And to do so not with a century of lead time but with only a few years. And, worse yet, to have to trudge out to the outer Solar System in the first place just to have a chance to divert the thing in time.<p>This calls for a vehicle with a stupendous amount of thrust and delta-V capability. Precisely what nuclear pulse propulsion excels at. More so, the ""pulse units"" can do double duty by being used to divert the comet (using thrust generated by ablation from stand-off explosions).<p>So ultimately research into nuclear pulse propulsion is likely to be key to preventing the destruction of human civilization on Earth.",1349719439

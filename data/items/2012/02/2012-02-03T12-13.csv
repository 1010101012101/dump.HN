3546918,comment,3546149,3546438,6,0,Isofarro,,,"""a project that showcases my JavaScript skills""<p>Quick review of your JavaScript:<p>Your functions and variables are in a global namespace. That's not a good sign. Sure if you are absolutely sure this code will never run alongside existing code, that's okay. But if you are working with code from multiple places, that's perhaps not the wisest approach. I guess you have no long-term intentions of allowing third party plugins and modules?<p>You're being too-clever using commas effectively as statement separators (or maybe your JS compressor is), and boolean operators instead of if statements. Shows off that you know how to flex JavaScript, but probably concerns whether you'd be a good fit into an existing team of developers.<p>I wonder if concatanating chunks of strings interspersed with variables is the best course of action. I'm tempted to suggest to collate the big strings together as static text with replaceable tokens (or perhaps bring in an existing templating language like mustache).<p>I worry about <div class=""clearDiv""> being used to clear floats. I'm surprised that blueprint forced you into that.<p>jQuery constructs like: $(a).parent().parent().attr(""id"") and $(a).parent().parent().prev  are brittle, they assume/enforce a particular markup. Which means if you need that extra wrapper div, now you need to update each of those constructs.",1328273955

I doubt that reality exists independent of intelligence, which makes reality a difficult beast to understand, like a naturally intractable problem. And if you insist on observing empirically, you're just collapsing cosmological scale invariant alternatives, but you can never figure it out completely. In fact it probably just keeps getting more complex as you keep trying, even considering the occasional unifying theories.<p>Anyways, I agree with everything that you've said, I just don't believe we can fully know how the phenomena actually works -- there are infinitely many ways in which it could work, all the time. To observe phenomena empirically in order to figure out how things <i>further</i> work, is to further isolate your existence into a remote section of the possible universes (and <i>sometimes</i> open your known universe up to new opportunities). I prefer to spend my time making reality rather than being chosen by it, which feels more like an active enterprise. In the end it doesn't matter.

3546851,comment,3544866,3544866,1,0,nkoren,,,"Very neat to see this! For the past year, I've been working on a very similar collaborative-design tool in an entirely different field (an aspect of transport planning). Probably won't have anything to show until the summer, but it's reassuring to see others pursuing similar  business plans, interaction models, etc. Helps to validate my feeling that the cloud and the browser are fundamentally the future of design.<p>My own application provides relatively high-level collaborative design functionality, and does not attempt to replicate the functionality of existing tools that are capable of very low-level simulation, analysis, and engineering. I imagine that it's a similar situation for hardware design, although probably with fewer tiers of software -- presumably Upverter users are working at a level that's much closer to the end result of the hardware-production process. Still, there must be existing (offline) design platforms with low-level functionality that you don't want to replicate in its entirety; these are presumably embedded in the workflows of existing hardware design houses in a way that will be difficult to supplant. Have you considered eventually producing plugins for these 3rd-party platforms, which would keep their designs in sync with the cloud-hosted model? This way, high-level design could be done in the browser, and low-level simulation etc. can be done in existing applications, while still taking advantage of Upverter's collaboration functionality.<p>This, of course, is my own long-range plan, although the web application is very much the initial focus. Just wondering if you've had similar thoughts, and if so, whether you've found such a strategy to have any particular merits or flaws that you'd care to discuss?",1328272133

IMO Toronto Pearson's border control are the worst I've ever experienced.<p>I made the honest mistake of being honest. I was working as an electrician for my fathers company, which meant I had a plenty of money and as much holiday time as I wanted (I declared I was taking 2 weeks, and the officer acted like this was a lot).<p>My second mistake was being nervous. I came from the UK where our police, even at the border, are professional, courteous and aren't carrying handguns. The Canadian border officer was extremely rude (In dealing with 5 female officers and 4 male officers I found the male ones are the only professional and courteous officers employed by CBP).<p>After being questioned for an hour I was taken to get my bags searched. The male officer doing the searching was extremely polite and professional. He opened my suitcase (for a very messy person, my luggage is always meticulously packed to maximize space) and automatically adopted ""We're not going to find anything here"" mode, like you visibly saw the guy relax and he started chatting about the books I'd brought with me (one was a manga that he bought his kid).<p>I then got questioned further, and taken back to the immigration desk and asked to wait. This is when I overheard another male officer say ""He's got nothing, you should have known that in the first five minutes. Just let him go."" So she asked for the contact information, accused me of them being false when they didn't immediately answer (noisy terminal and 2 hours waiting). I asked if I could text them, and got grilled for her accusing me of keeping my phone on. I basically threw my phone over the desk at her and said ""No it's been turned off for the past ten hours!"" Then her attitude changed.<p>Since then I've rehearsed everything I've said. Act pissed off and say as little as possible. When I get to the person who checks my claims I say, sounding extremely pissed off ""Hey, how are you?"" I take the same policy whenever I get sent to the actual officers (it happens way to frequently, I have no clue why, apparently being completely white bread I look like a major terrorist threat - actually with my knowledge of chemistry and physics I'm probably a bigger risk than any of the guys who hijacked the planes on 9/11 as I actually know how to make a nuclear bomb - probably a very, very dirty bomb - and explosives).",1328271766

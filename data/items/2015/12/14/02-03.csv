Is just that those plants are carefully chosen (only small nuts and berries), and the street is suitable (cars and bikes need to drive slowly in any case). Of course I prune ASAP any too low or too large stem and clean the area from fallen leaves when needed, as with any other shrub, and everybody is happy.<p>As long as this guys be consistent cleaning under canopies, and prune low or broken stems, they will have much more possibilities of success.<p>Remember also that fruit in the street should not be treated unless you put a &#x27;warning pesticides&#x27; signal somewhere.",1450061804

I see no problem with this as there are many countries with extensive liabilities and regulations when it comes to property and business practices one is allowed to conduct.<p>> By protecting customers from &quot;themselves&quot; and thus also protecting owners from customers, you are curtailing rights of both to engage in voluntary contract.<p>Oh I indeed am, or I at least am not opposing regulation in this matter from any ideological perspective. I don&#x27;t see such regulation as inherently bad, as it seems that you see.<p>> It&#x27;s not at all an &quot;implementation detail,&quot; it arises quite organically out of interpersonal exchange.<p>Many things arise &quot;quite organically&quot; from individual actors acting for their own benefit, but in many cases it can be argued for that there are places and times where regulation (governmental or otherwise) does indeed improve the society and the lives of the people within it.<p>> You know what I loathe?<p>I suppose I don&#x27;t despite having some suspicions, but please, don&#x27;t assume I <i>care</i> either.<p>> You provide a case for perceived suboptimal behavior of markets, but then by proposing regulation you completely ignore the prospect of suboptimal government action!<p>How couldn&#x27;t you say this exact same about <i>any</i> form of regulation within markets? And if so, to me it seems that you oppose regulation out of a principle -- and really, how you come off as suggests the same.<p>> You&#x27;d do yourself good by reading up on some public choice theory.<p>Oh, always, though I am almost certain our differing views lie somewhere else completely.

Lots goes to the Bay Area, some work at Google, Atlassian, Canva (in Sydney at least).<p>- As others have commented, it seems that there&#x27;s less useless stuff with unrealistic projections that gets built in Australia. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because Australian culture has a strong dose of cynicism (which also probably contributes to some of the remarks in this blog) or because the landscape is indeed bad enough that only the really good startups can survive.<p>- There are some Australian policies that work pretty well in favour of getting individual startups off the ground. Policies that help startups get off the ground include study assistance (~AUD 200 week from government whilst studying, means tested), a similar unemployment support program, and subsidised universities. These only contribute to the success of individuals, however, they&#x27;re not good for building an ecosystem.<p>- I&#x27;ve heard of a number of Australians travelling SE Asia and trying to get their v1 built from there.

Looking into the other books a little bit more, I&#x27;m not so certain Software Foundations would serve as a good introduction to them. The reason being that it focuses very heavily on the theorem-proving aspects. Concrete Semantics, at least its second half, would be an excellent primer. Software Foundations puts more weight on proving properties about languages than it does verifying particular programs. Whereas Concrete Semantics culminates in Hoare logic and abstract interpretation.<p>That sounds like an excellent use of model checking tools. Most approaches I&#x27;ve seen involve creating a model of some system separate from the implementation, which I think is risky. Still better than nothing, by far.<p>I&#x27;ll definitely have to check those books out now. Thanks for the recommendations!",1450060930

If you have labor that can be used to build itself (AI) then you can expand labour and capital to a very large number. You can also build new sources of energy very cheaply so the only limiting resource is matter. If you have the energy, capital and labor you can recycle most raw materials very cheaply. This leaves land as the only factor in production that does not scale.<p>What would all this mean in practice.

On the technical front, they are great, if a little condescending at times.<p>It&#x27;s on the &quot;business&quot; side where they are difficult to work with, potentially to the point of killing the venture.  For a government organisation, who you might think would be on &quot;your&quot; side, they are as hostile as any competitor.  You typically end up bound by a one sided contract, as CSIRO have enough lawyers to out lawyer any small company.  You have to be careful sharing information with them, as they tend to patent their research before revealing it to their partners, and after the fact you find out that the stuff you were collaboratively discussing and contributing to is now &quot;theirs&quot; to be licensed back to you.  There is also potential for them to do a &quot;spin out&quot;, in competition with your existing collaboration, and then it is a bun fight to get the organisation to see the potential for conflict.<p>I think it can be traced back to the government&#x27;s push for CSIRO to pay its own way, and past successes.  Since the WiFi patent bonanza, CSIRO/Data61 has &quot;gold fever&quot; and every industry interaction is locked down tight, to ensure that CSIRO gets a pound of flesh.

Is it so bad?<p>No, because correct programs use sync() and/or fsync() to force timely flushes.<p>A good database should not reply successfully to a write request until the write has been fully flushed to disk, so that an &quot;acknowledged write&quot; can never be lost. Also, it should perform write and sync operations in such a sequence that it cannot be left in a state where it is unable to recover -- that is, if a power outage happens during the transaction, then on recovery the database is either able to complete the transaction or undo it.<p>The basic way to accomplish this is to use a journal: each transaction is first appended to the journal and the journal synced to disk. Once the transaction is fully on-disk in the journal, then the database knows that it cannot &quot;forget&quot; the transaction, so it can reply successfully and work on updating the &quot;real&quot; data at its leisure.<p>Of course, if you&#x27;re working with something that is not a database, then who knows whether it syncs correctly. (For that matter, even if you&#x27;re working with a database, many have been known to get it wrong, sometimes intentionally in the name of performance. Be sure to read the docs.)<p>For traditional desktop apps that load and save whole individual files at a time, the &quot;write to temporary then rename&quot; approach should generally get the job done (technically you&#x27;re supposed to fsync() between writing and renaming, but many filesystems now do this implicitly). For anything more complicated, use sqlite or a full database.<p>> I&#x27;d expect more &quot;smartness&quot; of Linux, like, as soon as there is no &quot;write pressure&quot; to flush earlier.<p>Well, this would only mask bugs, not fix them -- it would narrow the window during which a failure causes loss. Meanwhile it would really harm performance in a few ways.<p>When writing a large file to disk sequentially, the filesystem often doesn&#x27;t know in advance how much you&#x27;re going to write, but it cannot make a good decision on where to put the file until it knows how big it will be. So filesystems implement &quot;delayed allocation&quot;, where they don&#x27;t actually decide where to put the file until they are forced to flush it. The longer the flush time, the better. If we&#x27;re talking about a large file transfer, the file is probably useless if it isn&#x27;t fully downloaded yet, so flushing it proactively would be pointless.<p>Also flushing small writes rather than batching might mean continuously rewriting the same sector (terrible for SSDs!) or consuming bandwidth to a network drive that is shared with other clients. Etc.",1450059650

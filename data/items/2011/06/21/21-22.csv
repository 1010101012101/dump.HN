It is a working group intended to represent the recommendation for an important standard.  Or at least I thought so.  Maybe not?<p><i>Your position (that WebGL is not good enough)</i><p>I never said that.<p><i>Finally, how do you propose that we vet the standard? What criteria do you propose to decide that WebGL standard is good enough?</i><p>Standards should be based on techniques and technologies that are fairly well known.  While there will always be debates about what goes in a standard, the arguments should almost always be able to point to existing implementations of a given technology.  Especially in areas where there might be controversy or concern.<p>What I do NOT like is a standard body criticizing an organization for not picking up a standard, if the standard hasn't really been vetted or tested yet.<p>If you want to push a non-vetted technology, go ahead, and let Mozilla and Chrome pick it up, but don't criticize those who don't at the onset.  Now in three years, once the kinks have been ironed out, then I think you can make the claim that the standard is solid -- everyone on board, but at this point I think its not fair to push anyone to implement it.",1308693429

So according to tesla's latest information at that link, the program doesn't actually pay money back as was claimed, but it also doesn't cost anything to dispose. It also states that 7 years or 160,000km (99,400 miles) is the expected typical life of the battery. 99,400/7 = 14,200 miles per year, expected usage, about 60 miles a day for 250 work days.<p>Haven't found the warranty information though which will tell us the real expected life for the Sedan. For the Roadsters, they come with a 3 year/36,000 mile warranty, but that does not include a battery replacement warranty, which is an additional purchase.<p>Musk stated in 2009 that a single battery pack replacement for the Roadster would cost $36,000 in 2009 dollars, but it seems to be something that wasn't actually available yet.

2680587,comment,2677899,2679191,3,0,hyperrail,,,"> I would imagine [Visual Studio would] improve a lot if they ate their own dogfood.<p>We do - just not VS :)<p>I used to work on Microsoft SQL Server. Our build system back then was substantially the same as Windows's. We used the Visual C++ command-line compiler, but we didn't use Visual Studio projects. Instead, our build utility was the BUILD.EXE program in the Windows driver development kit (<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff542351"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff542351</a>). BUILD is a wrapper for make that defines various useful macros, and enforces certain conventions for makefile contents (for example, the Sources file contains all and (mostly) only the source filenames to be compiled in the current directory). Our build environment wasn't the public DDK, but both have the same origin.<p>Relatively few people used Visual Studio, mainly because its C++ Intellisense was very slow (it took half an hour one time for the VS debugger to load a just-in-time crash dump). Instead, I used the Source Insight editor (a proprietary third-party product, but site-licensed by Microsoft), and used the WinDBG debugger from the public Debugging Tools for Windows. Source Insight is very fast at code browsing, fast enough for SQL Server's code base - indeed that is its main marketing bullet point. WinDBG isn't particularly fast, but it's no slouch either.",1308693060

Sending arbitrary GPU shaders can slow down GPUs.<p>2. Using standard, public, official graphics APIs provided by Windows might crash buggy drivers.<p>Re 1: Adobe does that in Flash, Microsoft is planning to do that in Silverlight 5. WebGL isn't proposing anything that Microsoft isn't doing already.

The income is helpful as any income is, but so far income from in-app purchases does not outstrip customer support and server costs (we do our own support, so factor in that for a small startup, you could be actually developing new features and improving the product vs. answering questions, handling refunds, having to dance like a marionette to get someone at Google to look at a critical billing bug).<p>Luckily, we do have an iOS app as well to subsidize the Android side of the house...but money doesn't buy time in this market, unfortunately.<p>Our cancellation rate is 20%. That is, for every 100 purchases, there are 20 cancellations for various reasons.<p>We suspected this outcome going into it, so this was not really a big deal to us - any offset to the support and maintenance costs is a boon, in our opinion, and keeping our users happy is important - Android users were bummed about missing the extra features, so we made it so.<p>We had a few hitches right out of the box with purchases getting lost (<a href=""https://code.google.com/p/marketbilling/issues/detail?id=14"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/marketbilling/issues/detail?id=14</a>), but we're able to help users around that if we're lucky enough that they contact us about it.<p>For the past week, however (right before the June 15th maintenance), Android Market isn't sending purchase status back to a subset of users, resulting in users paying multiple times for products that never get delivered (<a href=""https://code.google.com/p/marketbilling/issues/detail?id=32"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/marketbilling/issues/detail?id=32</a>).<p>So our revenues are going up! Except they're not, and I'm spending two hours a day dealing with angry customers who think we're thieves and ferreting through the Merchant Center trying to pre-emptively catch these broken transactions before a customer sees they were charged $20 bucks for a $1.99 feature because they didn't think the purchase took. Some of them I won't be able to catch unless they contact us, as it's not uncommon for people to use multiple credit cards with different names on them.<p>The fact that it's nearly impossible to get Google's attention on this is incredibly distressing. I've commented on bugs, reported it multiple times to the Merchant Center (our case has been forwarded ""to a specialist""), reported it via the Market Publisher site form, posted a forum message...why is it so hard to get Google's attention on something like this? Don't their fancy algorithms pick up on the fact that in-app revenue has jumped up across the board? It's one thing that users aren't able to purchase (that sucks), but an entirely different thing if users are able to purchase 20 times, but never get what they paid for.<p>To be honest, in-apps really aren't seeming very worth the risk.

This capability is available in WebGL, Silverlight 5 and Flash.<p>You don't want to remove this capability, because it's the core reason GPUs can do some things so much faster than a CPU.<p>You can try to sanitize shaders as much as possible (and I'm sure both Silverlight and WebGL implementation will do their best) but it's not even theoretically possible to decide a time complexity of arbitrary assembly code.<p>Writing code is about features vs. risk trade offs. Microsoft clearly has decided that the risks are acceptable for Silverlight but somehow the same category of risks is not acceptable for WebGL.<p>And if you ask me, I agree with WebGL folks and the Silverlight part of Microsoft. The worst that can happen is slowing down your computer. This is an annoyance but also an issue we encounter daily: both my Mac and Windows software, including the OSes, crash and misbehave rather regularly. I accept that because the annoyance that it causes is much less important than my desire to use the software.<p>It's also an annoyance that can be generated with technologies that already are part of the browser. A web page can exhaust any computer's memory (causing swapping) but sending arbitrarily large images. It's easy to write JavaScript that will eat CPU cycles. It's easy to DOS a browser by creating arbitrarily complex DOM and update it frequently enough. All those issues can be mitigated by browser implementors but none of them can really be fixed.

Unless gas goes up to $100/gallon, there's no way you'll save money by buying the Tesla over a affordable mid-size like a Honda Accord or Ford Fusion.<p>So let's compare that to a Mercedes E-class.  According to US News(<a href=""http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/Mercedes-Benz_E-Class/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/Mercedes-Be...</a>), the average price out the door is about $48,000 for the model with the fewest options.  Let's round that up to $50,000, because we want alloy wheels or some other additional feature.<p>The mileage of the car is 24 highway, 17 city, so let's average that to about 20(a bit more city driving than highway).  So that's $15,000 in gas over the 5 years(30/20=1.5).  So the total cost of the car, not counting other replacements, is around $65,000.<p>That's still $15,000 less than the $80,000 on the Tesla, and you're not going to spend $15,000 on car washes and other parts(brakes, oil, etc.) in that time.  It should also be noted that if you need to buy replacement batteries in that 5 year period, the cost increases to $100,000.<p>EDIT: I didn't include the cost of electricity, or the electrical work needed to get the extra 220 volt circuit out to your garage.",1308690406

I constantly make mistakes with ""to"" and ""until"" in Scala, where (1 to 9) is the same as (1 until 10).  They feel the same, and I've been having a hard time training my brain to treat them differently.  I've assumed that using () for exclusive interval bounds and [] for inclusive interval bounds, as in mathematics, would be easier to read.  (), [), (], and [] are immediately recognizable visual patterns in mathematical expressions; they're hard to confuse.  I often wish I could use them when writing code.<p>However, according to section 3.1.2.1 of the Mesa language manual [1], that was the notation used by Mesa, and according to Dijkstra, it didn't work.  It caused errors and confusion.  I can guess why -- in mathematics, the braces are made large enough to be visually prominent around the contents.  In a line of code all rendered in the same size font, they would be easy to lose and would not hit your subconscious mind the way they do in a mathematical expression.<p>Someday, with better code rendering in editors, maybe we can just use the appropriate braces to indicate whether interval bounds are inclusive or exclusive.<p>[1] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/blampson/23a-MesaManual/23a-MesaManual.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/blampson/23a-M...</a>",1308690171

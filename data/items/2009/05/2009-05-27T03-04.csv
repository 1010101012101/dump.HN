627955,comment,627722,627722,0,0,projectileboy,,,"In general, I tend to prefer using a text editor over most IDEs, which are usually big and fat and slow, with poor usability. IntelliJ - for me - has always been an exception. I can't comment on the Ruby or Python plugins for IntelliJ; however, the Clojure and (my) Arc plugin work just fine. I find working with them preferable to SLIME or TextMate or whatever else.",1243396237
627954,comment,627666,627666,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"The initial premise is wrong. Charm, looks and money are more powerful in the mating game than what someone does for a living. Poor, ugly, and boring artists and musicians don't get laid very often, even if they are good at what they do. A hot, rich bank manager is going to pull more trim than any financially struggling, mediocre looking artist. The stark reality is that the counter groups he mentioned, engineers and programmers (I know nothing about bank managers) are comprised of people who often take pride in the fact that they aren't good looking or charming and can be quite deluded about their potential for becoming rich.<p>His other point, that the reprap is going to make manufacturing obsolete, is very wishful thinking. The current commercial 3-D printers aren't good enough to produce anything other than models. The materials also cost $25 per cubic inch. Printing out a replica of a thermos costs $700. Costs are going to have to plummet and someone is going to need to invent a magical material that can automatically scrub out all the striations in the printed surfaces.",1243396156

627941,comment,627679,627895,0,0,patio11,,,"1)  You and I agree, no publisher who is capable of individually converting a user will sign up to use this.<p>2)  You and I agree, you can get all the bennies of being a publisher without actually attempting to convert users.  Put on tracking code, collect checks, yay.<p>3)  You think the game theory equilibrium results in a healthy ecosystem of lots of publishers cooperating to make an Internet-wide Content Cartel which will use the awe-inspiring power of warm fuzzies to convert a sizable number of people into Contexture customers.  (Incidentally: you seem to minimize the difference between the free and freemium experiences -- tiny upgrades and warm fuzzies.  I think this is because you understand that there being significant differences in the experiences makes sites substantially LESS valuable to you.  Do you understand that this this same dynamic <i>gives every site an incentive to defect?</i>)<p>4)  I think the game-theory equilibrium is that <i>nobody makes any attempt to convert users</i>, a few dozen blogs nobody has ever heard of put the tracking code on their sites, some intense competition happens for cuts of fractions of $4.80 times a few dozen people, and a few months later the system dies for lack of interest.<p>Like I said on the last thread, there needs to be a Killer App site to build this ecosystem around, like eBay was the Killer App that every other Paypal merchant got to freeload off of.  However, unlike the eBay/Paypal symbiot, in this case if you have the Killer App you should run screaming from this business proposition.<p>My, this would be a fascinating collective action problem for a game theory class...<p>But yeah:<p>All sites have an incentive to defect (not lock up a significant amount of value behind the paywall, not attempt to convert users in any significant fashion).<p>If no one puts value behind the paywall, then this idea is a more complicated implementation of the oldest failed business model, which is putting out a tip jar and hoping money falls into it.  Money very rarely spontaneously falls into tip jars.",1243395179

627939,comment,627306,627306,0,0,beaker,,,"Interesting to note that online sports betting will remain illegal under this bill due to intense lobbying by the NFL.<p>""Good handicappers can win against the house in sports betting, but it is impossible for anyone to win in the long run on slot machines, roulette or lotteries because they are totally random and based on luck with the house edge built in. Australia has recognized this and told its citizens that they are permitted to bet sports online, but it doesn’t want them wasting money on gambling where they can’t win. In America (and Canada) the states would rather citizens only bet on games where they can’t possibly win, hence essentially making the legalized gambling a hidden tax. It’s truly unfortunate, but is also a sign of the times."" -H. Johnson, majorwager.com",1243395090

Music can affect us at the most powerful level, the emotional level.<p>I saw Adam Sandler play at my university once and you would not believe how many beautiful college women were coming up to him after the show, wanting just a fragment of a moment of his attention.<p>The Hanukkah song. His trademark. It was scary to see almost everyone cheer and sing along as loud as they could. People were connecting their lives to his maybe-not-so-silly song.<p>I witnessed similar things with ""Hootie and the Blowfish"" and the Dave Matthews Band. I never understood ""Backstreet Boys"" and NKOTB. But maybe musicians are a societally-accepted way for women to objectify and idealize men.",1243395084

The auto-complete isn't what I'd like it to be for Ruby, but seems better for other languages.  It will run your program in NetBeans which makes it easy to fire up a development server without another window.  It will handle lots of tasks like plugin management or rake tasks.  Oh, and the refactor browser - I don't know how I ever renamed things without it.<p>Now, it's absolutely ugly (at least on OS X), but it's relatively straight forward which I can't say for Eclipse.  It might not be your cup of tea, but at the price of free, it's worth seeing if an IDE's tools such as its ability to spot parse errors, code completion, versioning integration, etc. will help you be more productive/happy.",1243394297

A lot of people seem to be linking to tweets on blogs and forums, and the 'old-fashioned' currency of these links seems to be missing in Topsy (and present in the Google version). This omission could be an issue for their ranking algos when linking to tweets becomes more common.<p>If I were the Topsy team, I would also worry about Twitter adding a static option to their own search.

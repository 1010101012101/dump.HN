It&#x27;s difficult to review and merge anything more than a concise set of changes that achieve their end goal and it&#x27;s also difficult to have committed such a changeset on the first try. Not having the team rebase out experimental and exploratory commits would be a huge mess and while it&#x27;s an option to just wait to commit until you&#x27;re done, that risks losing things, and leads to giant one-shot patches that can still be tricky to review and ship.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what workflows hg users that loathe to alter history adopt where they don&#x27;t suffer from trying to integrate messy branches.",1384736208

If you make a profit, it means people are willingly giving you money for the service you provide. You make more profit when people feel they benefit more from your service.

6751831,comment,6751377,6751377,3,0,ScottBurson,,,"My personal bizarre pet idea for bringing down healthcare costs: mandatory <i>minimum</i> copays.<p>The problem, by one analysis, is that patients have no incentive to weigh costs against benefits.  That&#x27;s a tough task in any case, and pushing it off to the insurers makes it harder, as the insurer has less information than either the patient or their doctor about their individual case.  The result is that neither patients nor (often) doctors know what the services cost.<p>In fact price information has been so effectively removed from the system that in some cases <i>nobody</i> knows what the service really costs.  tptacek posted a great example: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4465845"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4465845</a><p>The purpose of the mandatory minimum copay is to force price information back into the system.  When patients <i>have</i> to pay some part of the price of every service, they will therefore have to know what those prices are.<p>All that said, there are obviously some questions and problems to be dealt with.  For starters, what&#x27;s the formula for how much people have to pay?  On the large end, I would suggest something like (price in dollars) ^ 0.7.  This means for a $10k service, the copay would be about $600; for a $100k service, about $3000; and for a $1M service, around $16k.  Those numbers feel reasonable to me: big enough to make most people think twice about choosing a six-figure intervention, but not an absolute barrier if there&#x27;s a good medical reason.<p>On the small end, though, that formula produces numbers that are arguably too large.  A $200 service (if there is such a thing? maybe in lower-income rural areas) would have a $40 copay by that formula.  This risks discouraging people from getting preventative and urgent care that they need.  To correct for this we could simply subtract some fixed number from the result of the above formula.  I&#x27;m not sure what the right number is, but somewhere in the $40 - $80 range, I would guess.  (This provision could also be subject to means testing.)<p>Probably when I say &quot;mandatory&quot; what I really mean is &quot;the government provides incentives to make plans with this property significantly cheaper than those without&quot;.  I don&#x27;t care that rich people will circumvent the rule if they want; I just care that <i>most</i> people are on plans with this property, so that, as I say, price information is forced to flow again.",1384735406

If you have a problem, you wrote a tool to solve it, and you want to share that tool with the rest of the world, you won&#x27;t be threatened when someone else has a competing tool to share with the rest of the world.  Just explain <i>why</i> your tool is useful, and under what circumstances, and let people make up their own minds.  It&#x27;s no skin off your back if they choose not to use it.<p>If you participate in open-source to gain social approval and hacker cred, however, then it&#x27;s very threatening when other people choose to use a competing tool.  If your users disappear, so will your social approval, and you&#x27;ll be left feeling alone and unwanted.  And so people who are in open-source for this motivation frequently put-down technologies that that compete with their own favorite tools.  Sometimes it&#x27;s not even the tools&#x27; authors that do this; it is people who have adopted the tool and feel like their choice of preferred tool will be threatened if others adopt different tools.  Hence, fanboyism.<p>I have found, when evaluating technologies, that I rarely go wrong trying to select for the first category of community over the second.  The problem is that there&#x27;s a bit of an adverse selection effect.  If you ask &quot;What&#x27;s the best framework for X?&quot;, then all the people in the second category will rush to defend their favorite tool, while the people in the first category may present cogent arguments for their tool of choice but won&#x27;t seem all that impassioned.  Human beings are hard-wired to recognize passion, but we typically cannot recognize experience until we have had that experience itself.

One dict can easily take 1-2k for very few stored attributes (size can even depend on actual names used, because of the nature of dicts). So when it comes to millions of object instances, it is better to use __slots__ but those come with a cost: Those objects are not enhance-able any more.

What features of R did you particularly dislike, and what was your background before then?<p>I&#x27;m asking because S-PLUS (subsequently mostly replaced by R) was one of the first statistical languages I learned, and I have learned and actively used many other languages since, but I never before (or after) had this feeling that &quot;this is the most convenient language in existence, and it does <i>everything</i> precisely the way I want and expect&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t know Ruby (the snippets I&#x27;ve seen do look very nice, but it&#x27;s mostly used in a very different domain), but Python does not come anywhere close (e.g. compare the treatment of defaul parameter values!), nor does Matlab (one function per file? wtf?), or C++, or Gauss, or really anything reasonably high level that I can think of. SAS and Stata might have a slight edge over R in very specific use cases, but outside of those, there is absolutely no comparison. Julia has a lot of potential, but imo it&#x27;s not quite there yet. Also, R is ridiculously easy to incorporate C/C++/Fortran/etc. code into, and S3 is a really wonderful OOP/abstraction system.<p>It&#x27;s definitely not perfect, and today R does not quite evoke the same sentiment as S+ did back ~15 years ago, as R did away with some of my favorite S features and introduced a lot of complexity (although, it&#x27;s also possible that my typical use cases became more complex, so I have to deal with internals more often). Also there are features like the apply() family of functions that I&#x27;ve seen done better, and some R features apparently make it hard to optimize code. But there is very little in the language that I could honestly say I seriously dislike.",1384733679

This is why poor people eat at McDonalds; because of the subsidies, corn-fed beef & chicken and soda made from high-fructose corn syrup are much cheaper than healthier alternatives, and so that is all poor people can afford.

I explained that every CCIE has a CCIE number and that if he gave us a number, we could check it with Cisco. My boss said that because it was now a sensitive HR situation he wanted to handle it. He advised me to go out for a long lunch that day.<p>When I got back, the guy&#x27;s desk had been cleared which was very unusual because in the UK people normally work out their notice period, even if they take a job with a competitor or are laid off. My boss called me in at the end of the day, and thanked me for my investigation and then said that he managed to convince HR to raise my salary by 20k pounds.<p>Working in large corporate environments in more than one country, I have seen this kind of thing again and again. One particular case was the CEO in New York of a multinational technical company that I had joined. He only lasted two years though because the company was spending too fast.<p>Now I am always suspicious of people who are considered rockstars or geniuses. If they were really so smart then maybe they would apply that intelligence to sweeping stuff under the rug and pulling the wool over management&#x27;s eyes, like a certain operations manager at a multinational Internet SaaS company that I once worked at. Technically he was pure incompetence but he managed to hide it for several years by staying online 24x7 and hacking his way around issues in secret until he literally went nuts and collapsed due to lack of sleep and 24x7 stress.",1384733126

(google)<p>EDIT: okay so not sure how i forgot this because /i worked there/ but when apple ran their &#x27;stargazing app&#x27; promotions about a year ago they only featured ios exclusive apps - they also were regularly featuring starwalk aside from that promotion (which is ios exclusive). the app i worked on &#x27;star chart&#x27; was not featured - it has been featured recently because it early adopted the iOS 7 UI style - but before that it got missed despite outranking most of those other apps and being a higher quality product more consistent with apple&#x27;s design guidelines and ethos. now i don&#x27;t think that necessarily the app was worthy of feature, but a lot of much less polished or worthy apps got a lot of screenspace on the store and the only thing they had in common was not having shipped on other platforms. as much as i dislike those guys for their disgusting attitude towards customers and employees - frankly they deserved better treatment than they got from apple in that regard. not being featured is fine, but featuring vastly inferior competitiors because they are exclusive is utterly despicable.",1384733074

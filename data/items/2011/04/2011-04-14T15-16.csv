The thrill for a 15-year-old hunter after his (or her) first big kill is probably unmatched by the smaller victory of a good SAT score or college admission... or anything we experience in our lives, for that matter. Merely surviving can give people a much stronger sense of purpose than most office jobs. On the other hand, the violent death rate was somewhere around 0.5% per year from conflict with other humans alone. Life expectancy for someone who survived childhood was probably in the mid-50s and some people definitely achieved what would be considered ""old age"" even today, but if you made it to 65, almost all of your childhood friends would be dead.<p>It's impossible to compare subjective experiences.

The most important question of law has generally been: who should own what? This is where the ancestors (cum deities) come in. A king will just have you killed if you steal his possessions. What happens when he dies and his less charismatic son wants the same power and privilege? His son says, ""If you don't show the same loyalty to me as you showed my father, he will possess a lion and that lion will eat you."" This raises the possibility of an afterlife. A generation later, the grandson says, ""If you disobey me, my grandfather will torment you forever in the afterlife."" Eventually, these ancestors became gods and their accomplishments are magnified to supernatural levels of achievement. Three thousand years of oral tradition later, with a human ancestor morphed into a fictional character and no one able to determine who the ""real"" descendants were, priests (people of high social class) become the intermediaries. Divination, religion, and law were intertwined at this time. Law began from the question, ""How do we organize our society to keep the gods happy?"" And it needed written tradition to keep track of what worked and what didn't. Most of what was being divined at first was who ""rightfully"" owns land, possessions, and people-- and gambling, for the record, probably has the same roots: Let's ask the gods who should have these resources.<p>This is not to say that pragmatic, civil law could have emerged in the absence of religion, and I'm sure that half the architects of ancient law were thinking, ""I don't really believe in this supernatural shit, but these ideas work"", but it seems not to have happened that way. Modern philosophy didn't even exist until 700 BC at the earliest, by which point the ancestors and divine-kings and gods were well-established.<p>By the way, I don't mean to disparage religious belief outright with this summary. I'm a skeptic who generally finds organized religion silly, but I'm actually a deistic Buddhist, not an atheist or agnostic. That, however, is a discussion for another time.",1302795415

Graphs are ""whiteboard friendly"" in as much as you can store data exactly as you would likely sketch it up when thinking purely in your domain. Because the graph structure is generic, you can even happily use it as a key-value or document storage. And, multiple intersecting domains can co-exist within the same graph. A graph could be a simple list, a map, a tree, or a complex network of data. With Neo4j, you'd get that expressiveness with the confidence of ACID behavior.<p>Beyond that, the Not-Only SQL options are a reminder to pick the storage that fits your application, rather than fit your application to the storage you have. Be domain appropriate.<p>I usually think in terms of:
RDBMS - when aggregating data is important
Graphs - when relationships between records matters
KV - when you have really simple data, but gazillions of records
Document - when you have complex, but unrelated and possibly non-uniform data<p>Cheers,

We work, including commuting, personal errands, and house chores, about 2700 hours per year. Most pre-agrarian people did not work as many hours. Their ""work"" was a lot more dangerous (throwing spears at angry, large animals) and probably more intense. The stakes were also a lot higher: if they fail, they die. That said, they probably only worked about 1600-2400 hours per year because there wasn't all that much work for them to do. During the off-season (hunting-wise) and during the winter (for gatherers) it's also likely that they slept 10-18 hours per day due to low metabolism/semi-hibernation. (Many medieval people in the Alps went into semi-hibernation in the winter, sleeping 16-20 hours per day.) Whether this is to be considered ""free time"" is uncertain and probably somewhat subjective. It's unclear what they did. It's likely that their lives were very boring by our standards, exciting only on account of the extreme danger.",1302794061

Their lives were probably a lot more stressful and certainly extremely violent, but depression was probably nonexistent (a death sentence). I would argue that most modern people would consider their lifestyles undesirable.<p>I think people tend to look at pre-agrarian society with rose-colored glasses. Did people have better nutrition, in 10000 BC, if they were hunter-gatherers rather than farmers? Yes; that's not even debated. I don't know how much should be taken out of that. For example, there's the often made and almost certainly false claim that agriculture led to gender inequality. From a gender-equality perspective, I don't think that pre-agrarian society was the utopia some people make it out to be. Pre-monogamous societies pretty much invariably treated women as property, because access to women was the signal (and primary benefit) of a man's social status. ""Alphas"" had many wives, ""gammas"" had none and were sent off to war as soldiers (to either ""take"" wives or die). It was better to be a woman than a low-status man, but that doesn't mean gender equality was there. It's hard to have gender equality in that sort of morally debased culture. Monogamous marriage (which came much, much later than agriculture) was the very first wave of feminism.",1302793557

One can extend this: How do you know the Industrial Revolution made people lives better (read Dickens to see the inhuman conditions), or the nuclear revolution (Chernobyl, Japan), or the Internet revolution (the ADD generation texting, sexting, etc). Prof. Diamond thesis seems to be that we made a <i>huge</i> mistake by moving from hunter gatherer to agricultural society, which, inevitably, brought about most of the evils we are fighting with now. Proof? Just look at the idyllic life of current hunter gatherers.<p>To back his claim, he puts forth arguments ranging from absurd<p>""As for the claim that agriculture encouraged the flowering of art by providing us with leisure time, modern hunter-gatherers have at least as much free time as do farmers. The whole emphasis on leisure time as a critical factor seems to me misguided. Gorillas have had ample free time to build their own Parthenon, had they wanted to.""<p>to anecdotal, i.e. no proof at all<p>""Farming may have encouraged inequality between the sexes, as well... Women in agricultural societies were sometimes made beasts of burden. In New Guinea farming communities today I often see women staggering under loads of vegetables and firewood while the men walk empty-handed. Once while on a field trip ...""<p>And the final stroke, the masterful FUD-laden last paragraph:<p>""As our second midnight approaches, will the plight of famine-stricken peasants gradually spread to engulf us all? Or will we somehow achieve those seductive blessings that we imagine behind agriculture's glittering facade, and that have so far eluded us? ""<p>Setting aside that there is no global shortage of food (does not mean that nobody's is hungry, but the reasons are complex and food shortage is not one of them), most of this is, at best speculative.<p>If you liked his point of view, than you may also like Prof. Eric Pianka's thesis that there are too many people on earth and if an airborne Ebola virus kills 90% it would be a good thing (<a href=""http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~varanus/Everybody.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~varanus/Everybody.html</a>).<p>The problem with these views is that they resonate with a certain mindset, people who think we have too much science and technology in our lives and it would have been better to live like the ""so-called"" primitive people.

Can anyone clarify?<p>I've looked at uncollege.org, and the ""What"" page tells me that it's ""a social movement support self-directed higher education."" This means very little sense to me, and I'm sure I'm not unique in that.<p>Then he elaborates:<p>(1) ""Writing a book about learning from life."" Wait, what? This says absolutely nothing! In order to help you learn on your own, I will write a book about helping you learn on your own. But this is terrifically unhelpful; ""learning on your own"" is a massive area that needs to be specific in order to be of any use at all. As it stands, it's really no different from ""PowerPoint for Dummies""--which, while useful for some people, is hardly revolutionary in sparking people to consider not going to college.<p>(2) ""Developing experiential learning programs at existing colleges that are truly student directed."" Again, this says absolutely nothing to me. Of <i>course</i> we all want students to have valuable, interactive college experiences. The problem is in determining <i>how</i> to do that, not determining that it should be done!<p>(3) ""Building a platform to validate self-directed learning, allowing people to demonstrate their talents in an online portfolio and bypass the college degree."" This gets somewhere, I think--he's finally coming up with some sort of idea. But it's unclear how this is superior to existing solutions (people already provide portfolios and examples of past work, and standardized tests exist to address this to some degree), and--as with the other cases--the execution is critical.<p>I don't mean to condemn everything about Stephens here. It does sound like he's motivated toward a worthy cause, and while I think college still has value for a lot of people, I think success in this realm would be fantastic. But it seems clear to me that his ideas are very undeveloped, and I'm very skeptical of the likelihood of his success based on what I've seen so far. Thiel might think differently--that the fact that he dropped out indicates some drive and initiative that'll lead him to success--but I disagree, and think that this is just a prime example of why it's good for many people to study for a few years.",1302793223

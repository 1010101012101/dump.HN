1004511,comment,1004072,1004304,0,0,doubleukay2,,,"""SRV records dont store IP addresses, they store names. So the browser does a SRV req, orders by priority and weight, picks one, then does an A lookup and attempts connection.""<p>Not necessarily in this case. The DNS server can provide the A record in the Additional Section. Lookups returning hostname-based records e.g. MX/NS/CNAME records benefit from this too. Until it exceeds the UDP reply size limit of course.<p>But if a SRV record doesn't exist, then the result of an A lookup needs to be used. That A lookup is done sequentially or in parallel (think of how dual-stack browsers handle of AAAA/A lookups).",1261198581

1004507,comment,1004024,1004024,0,0,jhancock,,,"I think its great that webapps have borrowed some concepts from MVC.  But people should understand that this new thing should be called something like ""web_mvc"" or less glamourous ""web_page_shared_nothing_mvc"".<p>Separation of code and componentized page rendering are well done by web frameworks which call themselves MVC, but are leaving a lot on the table from the original use of the pattern.<p>The original MVC had models, views, and controllers living independent life cycles.  These objects used events and inversion of control to bind and inject themselves into one another.  Far more interesting than web_mvc which basically spins up a bunch of objects, renders a page and throws everything away until the next request.  The closest thing web frameworks have to original MVC lives in projects like seaside and lift.",1261198055

1004501,comment,1003477,1003477,0,0,houseabsolute,,,"Why I don't really care: most of the people who benefit from academic research papers fall into one of the following categories:<p><pre><code>    1. Academic professionals.\n    2. Students.\n    3. Industry professionals.\n    4. Government professionals.\n</code></pre>\nIn all three cases, there is an entity that will gladly pay the paltry sum required to get you access to ACM papers should you have even the slightest realistic need for them. You have to work pretty hard to be in a category where the dues will be both a significant expense and not paid for by someone else.<p>That is, it's quite silly that the government pays for research which a private organization can then benefit from without similarly paying back for it. However, it'd be even more silly to get worked up over every minor injustice when there are so much greater ones in equally easy reach.",1261197769

In MongoDB, array elements are indexed so searching for words, tags, etc. is easy. The Ruby client support is excellent. Casandra is really easy to set up (installing the cassandra gem, then doing 'cassandra_helper cassandra' installs all cassandra dependencies). But Casandra requires a lot of application specific configuration. I always leave MongoDB running on my MacBook and two of my servers so it is ready at hand.",1261196409

If your data center going down is a problem, then you don't really have a very robust failover plan.<p>If, instead, you _plan_ for the Data Center to go down, and treat a data center failure as a trivial issue, then your DR plans start to become significantly more robust.<p>In particular, the companies that I admire are ones that routinely swap, on a routine basis, their DR and production facilities - and when a production data center goes down they don't even bother to wait - they just light up the DR center and are back in business.<p>Most of the SaaS Financial Hosting companies (Oracle Financials) that I've talked with will provide you with that feature.",1261196184

1004478,comment,1002662,1003302,0,0,Kadin,,,"When a browser pops up too many false-alarm warnings like that, users start to regard the browser as broken.<p>And given that commercial certs change fairly frequently (they expire every year or two, in most cases), you would have a <i>lot</i> of false alarms for each actual DNS hijacking.  The vast majority of the times users saw such a message would be for the wrong reasons, and they'd be well-trained to ignore it long by the time an actual hijack attempt caused it to display.<p>Also, consider the case of multiple HTTPS servers, each with its <i>own</i> valid server certificate, in round-robin configuration, serving the same domain.  Each time a user went from one server to another, the cert would change (but still be valid).  They'd get errors all the time -- and my understanding is that this setup (separate certs and private keys for each server, rather than copying the same cert and private key across multiple machines) is considered best practice.<p>The real problem is that CA-based security relies on the CAs to not hand out certificates stupidly.  Yet that's exactly what they do, when they use DNS (in the form of MX records, by sending email) to verify ownership of a site and issue a valid certificate.<p>You're correct that browser developers have the power here, but their power lies in threatening to drop shady CAs from the trusted root list (which would put a CA instantly out of business -- if your certs cause errors in a major browser, you're dead meat as a CA), not building in more warnings that will just give users bad habits.<p>IMO, any CA that is doing domain ""verification"" via DNS records (rather than going through WHOIS or, better yet, the domain's registrar and contacting the domain's owner of record) ought to be dumped from the trusted root list.<p>There needs to be a much stricter auditing and enforcement/removal system for bad and sloppy, lazy CAs.  They are supposed to be the keystone of X.509 PKI, but in reality strike me as being closer to its Achilles Heel.",1261195678

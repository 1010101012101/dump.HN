7903413,comment,7900533,7901804,2,0,xnerak,,,"I recently finished reading the book mentioned in the article and in the book, they have a chapter focused on ways to improve the situation for people living in poverty.  What I got from it was that programs to help poor people need to be tweaked to not tax their bandwidth as much and there is no real one size fits all solution.<p>One example in the book is the computer skills programs that are often offered by employment services offices.  These programs are usually several weeks long and build on knowledge from previous weeks.  For someone who is struggling financially, attending these classes weekly could be difficult.  You miss one class, and the next class makes no sense and you feel like you&#x27;re wasting your time.  The authors&#x27; suggestion is to restructure these classes to be more modular and allow people to attend these classes based on their schedules.<p>I think it&#x27;s not so much that people don&#x27;t want the poor to solve their problems.  It&#x27;s that they don&#x27;t want to make it easier for them.  People feel that they themselves did just fine without all the benefits that the poor get, so why should we make it easier for them?",1402995545

To defeat a patent claim, it&#x27;s a matter of adding enough variance in your code to defeat ONE of the conditions.<p>That&#x27;s not true. Thanks to the doctrine of equivalents you can still infringe on a patent even if your invention differs from what the claim describes. (Now, if you want your invention to count as prior art, it <i>does</i> have to exactly match the claim - whether two inventions are considered the same for prior art purposes is different from whether they&#x27;re considered the same for infringement purposes.)",1402995297

Maybe because per-site memory measurements aren&#x27;t prominent enough.<p>Do you mean to say these measurements exist? I couldn&#x27;t find them in <i>about:memory</i> (per-site, that is). \nThat would be an awesome feature! I could easily kill the tabs which are eating up my RAM if only I knew which ones were doing it. Better yet, I could see if I am being reckless with memory in my own webapps.<p>The issue I am having is not that browser uses too much RAM. The issue is that I (as a user) am not aware of high memory usage until it is too late. Even worse, I have no clue what caused this state and have no option to learn from previous &quot;mistakes&quot; (if some site is using too much RAM, I could avoid it or close it when not needed anymore). So yes, per-site (per-tab?) memory usage indicators would solve my issue completely.<p>Thanks again for taking your time to answer, and keep up the good work!

There may not be a simple linear relationship between the individual action and the ultimate outcome, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that individual actions have an influence on the market price.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t change the fact that without individual actions, a market price would never change (and would never exist in the first place), and that therefore, individuals have some power over the market price.<p>That does not mean that an individual can just dictate what the price should be without any constraints, but it does mean that your definition of a competitive market is a meaningless phantasy that cannot possibly exist.<p>The whole field of optimal control theory is about how to control complex structures that emerge from individual controls.<p>Edit to add: By the way, outside of the theoretical argument, I think it&#x27;s a good idea to take a brief look at what kind of markets exist empirically. In all markets that actually exist, it is obvious that there are actors who are capable of changing the market price.<p>This holds for exchanges, where actors change the price by buying or selling. It also holds for more everyday markets where it&#x27;s typically the seller who puts up a sticker price. For example, the people running a supermarket set the price for the items in the supermarket.<p>One last thought: My argument is basically that for every market, there is some function f whose outputs are the prices in the market, and that the only inputs of this function is the history of actions of market participants (the shape of the function depends on the structure of the market).<p>My argument then continues to say that since the market price is a function of only the actions of the market participants, there must be at least one market participant whose actions influence the price, otherwise the price could never change. This is a simple mathematical statement.<p>Your attempted counter-argument is that the function f could be very complicated, which is completely irrelevant to my argument.",1402992746

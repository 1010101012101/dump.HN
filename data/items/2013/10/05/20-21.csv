Mass produced consumer goods for one. An xbox (or tesla) costs the same whether you make $100k in SF or $50k in middle America.<p>You know what else? Travel. Domestic and international travel is a LOT more affordable when you&#x27;re making $100k in SF.<p>And a big one: Retirement. You sock away your SF salary for 40 years and then retire in a cheaper COL area with no state income tax.<p>The truth is, even here, $100k is a lot of money. It really is. It&#x27;s not rich by any stretch, but it&#x27;s certainly not average middle class living. It is frustrating that a couple making over $200k can hardly buy 1000sq ft house while staying inside 30% (of gross income) housing budget, a metric widely seen as &quot;affordable housing.&quot; But still, on balance, that couple making $200k is doing very, very well.<p>And the truth is, there are a lot of engineers here that, with liquidity events (which might just mean vesting your RSU&#x27;s in an already public company), are earning $200k a year. That <i>literally</i> puts you in the top 1% of wage earners. (But not in THE &quot;1%&quot; of course which is usually a term referring to net worth and not gross income.

As a beginner you aren&#x27;t capable of the prediction/anticipation necessary to position yourself precisely for dynamic stability. You overcome this largely by bracing multiple muscles against each other.<p>But once you practice enough that your brain understands and anticipates, everything suddenly feels much more effortless. A beginning snowboarder will burn through to muscle fatigue limits in just a couple hours on the bunny hill. An experience snowboarder can ride the steeps all day with only mild fatigue. Sure, there&#x27;s likely to be a difference in physical conditioning too, but in my experience that&#x27;s a lessor factor than simply knowing/feeling how to move the minimum amount at the precisely right moment.<p>So while a revolutionary advance in artificial muscles would be grand, I think there still may be significant opportunities with existing actuators.",1381006390

It has legs instead of wheels. I would disagree that they add no value, if one separates the engineering from the one possible application out of many. If the military wants a fully autonomous killing machine once they figure out the &quot;fully autonomous&quot; part (which has, really, more to do with software than hardware) then the hardware part of it - whether it has two legs, or four, or wheels or treads or flies, isn&#x27;t really going to matter.",1381006201

So it wasn&#x27;t as simple as one input, one output. Some files were shared for certain clients, some were client specific.

6501864,comment,6501362,6501362,2,0,pastProlog,,,"One phenomenon which Facebook takes into account which Twitter does not is that of the loquacious acquaintance, possibly someone with a business constantly hyping things, possibly someone who just likes to hear themselves speak more often than I do.  They apply slight pressure to me to follow them on Twitter or friend them on Facebook so I do so.<p>On Facebook I can easily set people to three settings which are private to me - read everything they write, read only significant things they write (things which get more than ordinary likes/replies, or whatever), or ignore them.  This is great for me, otherwise my entire Facebook feed would be filled with my 4-5 chattiest friends or current/former coworkers, I&#x27;d have to scroll through their collective 10-12 posts a day to see anyone elses, etc.<p>Twitter does not have this option where I publicly follow someone, due to them pressuring me to follow them on Twitter, but where I can actually privately ignore them.  Which just tends to mean I use Twitter less.  Maybe there is an option buried somewhere where I can do this, but it&#x27;s definitely not obvious like on Facebook.  Which just means I use Twitter a lot less.  Because all it is for me is a constant stream of 4-5 chatty acquaintances with the dozens of others I follow popping in once in a while.<p>There are ways to deal with this on Twitter, but none of them are that good.  I can create another account, but then there are problems from that - accounts with private tweets I no longer have access to or have to ask for two adds from everyone etc.  I can create a private list without these people on it, but then I have to go to the trouble of maintaining two lists - the main list and the private list.  Facebook just makes this a lot easier.",1381003405

Also, California is the highest-taxed state in the republic, so adjust that pre-tax salary of $100K downward a bit more in real terms.<p>Consumer goods like cars and laptops and TVs will cost the same, to a first approximation, anywhere in the continental U.S. But in some coastal areas, you have real estate costs that are 20x that of cheaper areas with salaries/compensation packages that are generally not 20x higher. In central Pennsylvania towns the median household income, for instance, tends to be around $26K and the median house cost is $64K, meaning houses are 2.5X median income.<p>In Palo Alto, on the other hand, the median house cost is around $2.25M, and the median family income is around $160K, meaning houses are 13.75X median income. Part of this are older PA families who bought when land was cheap many decades ago and are grandfathered in with lower tax rates, but part of this is also people who are stretching their finances dangerously to be able to afford there. (Even though those $2.25M median homes are often smaller than the national average, measured by square footage.)<p>It&#x27;s possible to make $100K in the SF bay area and be, in real terms, poorer than someone making half that in central Pennsylvania.",1381003300

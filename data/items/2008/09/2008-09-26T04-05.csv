Newsflash! tricking people to send invites will result in massive growth under ANY design.<p>Besides, I call bullshit on redesign being at fault for the app fallout. The real culprit is the ban on incentivized invites.",1222405109

315762,comment,314920,315136,0,0,Shooter,,,"Most programmers SUCK at marketing.<p>Too many projects waste valuable front page space with minutiae before they even tell you what the hell the project is or why you should care. Programming project sites are usually more focused on people with commit privileges than they are on recruiting new users.  Which is probably  a big reason why so many projects never gain any momentum beyond the founding members.<p>One of my personal pet peeves: Why do so many open-source projects make you search everywhere (or even download code) in order to find out what freaking language they use for the project?  With most programmers only knowing/using a few languages, it seems that this would be a prominent bit of information to impart on the front page, yeah?<p>I shouldn't have to download code to learn that the project is written in Intercal or C#, ferchrissakes!<p>""This project is written in XXXXX"" is more helpful to me than knowing the last few esoteric bugs that were fixed.<p>I cringe every time I see the most valuable real estate on a programming project site used to show the revision history.",1222404642

315754,story,,,1,0,jgamman,"Ask HN: Looking for a software developer Akl/NZ",,"Hey, just started a new job and we have a need for some good software development skills.  I'm looking for someone that likes building software that helps people visualise data on the web.  We are in the energy/electricity industry so there are a lot geographical/time based aspects to it.  Initially we are just trying to showcase how better tools are out there.  This gig would suit someone graduating in November looking to get industry experience and build a portfolio over the summer.  I'm not going to tell you what tools to use but i'll take some convincing before i change from preferring to use free and open source. and while i can't program, i am partial to a python/javascript/SciPy/django/matplotlib type arrangement. ultimately, we're looking to build and trumpet a better toolbox but these first baby steps are more 'mash-up some location data with google maps on a webpage and add some sliders to move through the data set', ditto with matplotlib on some market data.  If you think this sounds interesting, relish the opportunity to improve upon the 'download a .xls of this data' paradigm and you're in Auckland over summer (or know someone who is) drop me a line at: joe a_t neri dot org dot nz and i'll spell out our vision in a bit more detail.",1222403700

315745,comment,315142,315352,0,0,tobyo,,,"Yes, the ajax loading is much less intrusive than loading a new page.  It makes it far easier to search through the existing results.  It needs one or two UI changes:<p>1) When you click 'more results' add a divider before the first new result to make it clear which new results just appeared.  In most cases the first new link will already be highlighted since the mouse will be hovering overy it but any antsy mouser will not have this benefit.<p>Also, I notice that I have the tendency (and need) to move the mouse off the first new link so I can read it.  This is very inefficient so it would best to append the new results one line below the 'more links' link.<p>2) Consider adding an auto-scroll to put the first new result at the top or middle of the page to reduce scrolling.  This may be disruptive, however.",1222403244

1637855,comment,1637630,1637824,0,0,Silhouette,,,"> Working closely with facebook like this, you're kind of on the inside.<p>Sure, but there is a risk/benefit analysis to be done here. If you bet your business on one big company like that, you not only are you betting that the company won't choose to squish you, you are also betting that the company will remain strong enough to support you for as long as it matters.<p>If you are aiming to build a modest company whose service is fundamentally tied into a currently dominant big player and probably looking for an early exit, that might not matter all that much. On the other hand, if you have a neat general idea and the big company just happens to be the dominant platform in a relevant field today, that doesn't mean they will still be so tomorrow, and your idea might fit with competitor platforms just as neatly.<p>Personally, of all the companies in the world I would not build my business around today, Facebook is one of the top three. The others are Google and Apple. All three have a demonstrable history of trying stuff and then backpeddling, so if you get taken over, you might get a bit from your options but your idea and future development are hardly secure. All three have a track record of screwing the little guy, sometimes without even noticing, so if you're just building on their platform independently, you're highly vulnerable. And worst of all, I expect all three to take a severe legal and/or market-driven beating within the next couple of years.<p>For Google or Facebook, it will probably be on privacy grounds. You just can't go around making the arrogant statements their execs keep making, and presuming to collect and sell that kind of personally sensitive data, in a world where the public is increasingly concerned about these things and serious crime built around data loss and ID theft is rising fast. Both companies have already been hit hard by privacy watchdogs in several countries.<p>For Apple, it will probably be because the walls around their garden aren't strong enough but their corporate arrogance makes them think they are. Steve will probably just wake up one morning and suddenly realise that Android phones or a resurgence from a player like Palm or Blackberry has taken most of his market share, without even noticing how it happened.<p>Plus of course there are always the basic business threats. Facebook only needs enough people to start leaving that it can no longer function as the de facto standard way for friends to share stuff and it's toast, just like other social networks before it. Google only needs someone else to come up with a better way to do search and it's toast, just like other search engines before it. Apple... Well, they have a prestige brand in the middle of the worst financial crisis in two generations, so you do the math.<p>To avoid going down with the ship, if I were building a new on-line tool today and needed to work with a big player for platform support, I would definitely want to be working on portable, open standards as much as possible. That is exactly what big players like Facebook do not have, and will try to their dying financial statement not to introduce since it would be anathema to their business model.",1282876544

1637851,comment,1637782,1637826,0,0,NathanKP,,,"The only possible protection that I can think of would be for Facebook to require confirmation when someone likes a page. Essentially it would redirect the user to Facebook where they would see a page that says ""Are you sure you want to like ______?"" Then, after they agreed, it would redirect them back to the original site. However, this would be highly undesirable for people who use the Facebook like button, because it could siphon away potentially valuable visitors who appreciated the site enough to like it.<p>Another option might be for Facebook to ban likes on a domain basis. If a domain is using spammy techniques like this then ban it from being liked by anyone. Of course that means more overhead and moderation.<p>I don't think there is a good solution to this, only work arounds.",1282876428

I always picked the right most lane which was wider than the rest (so I have more room to do breast strokes).  After a few laps, I noticed the lady who was sharing my lane kept giving me the stink eye. I thought nothing of it until she stopped me and started giving me a lecture on pool etiquette.  She thought I was a complete ass for not greeting her before I jumped in and for not asking for her permission to share.  Besides being impolite, she thought I was also unsafe.  I paused for about 10 microseconds and I decided to apologize.  As an entrepreneur, those are your choices.  After many painful lessons, I finally learned how to pick my battles and getting in an argument with an old lady in my shorts was a good use of my argumentative skill.

If so, then what can I do to get it? And would it accelerate my immigration process?<p>Waiting for your answer urgently, and thanks in advance,\nAhmed. :)",1282875201

They're not going to block someone they are partnering with, and with an advanced look at the beta features, you're not going to be hit with broken apps with the api changes.<p>As far as reimplementing goes, I think they'd just buy you first.  They've already invested time and resources to help you develop your app/site, so it will be natural for them just to aquire you.<p>It's perfect for YC (extra high chance for the startups to be bought by FB) and good for FB (people doing cool, interesting social things they can incorporate).  I am still not a fan, but I guess I'm not a huge fan of Facebook anyways.",1282875172

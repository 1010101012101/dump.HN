I often go up to 7 days without seeing another human being and when I do it's either a McDonalds server or a pizza delivery guy, this part is turning me insane.<p>I have absolute control over my environment, if I don't like a noise or the heat or a smell I fix it, this isn't the reality most people have so when my financial/employment situation changes I will have to adjust very rabidly, with that in mind I've made the decision to move into an environment less desirable than the one I have now (working from an office) but I think it's for the best. At least I'll have a 2 bedroom apartment to myself to hide in at weekends if it is terrible.<p>Living alone is wonderful and I always find it strange how people can live with others, I can understand the desire people have for human interaction but being able to wake up and then go to bed without having seen another person in the waking period is just so great, true freedom. Maybe it just comes down to control.",1330199979

For the current project I'm working on (C++) I've been using function overloading. So for example, I have a class called BankAccount. I have a private and a public method that will set the balance or return the balance (set is private, get is public) of the account, I've overloaded this so that if no parameter is passed it returns the balance, and if a parameter is passed it will set the balance accordingly. I use this in my deposit and withdrawal methods. I do the same thing for other setters/getters.

In fact, for a pretty long time, Java made my an adherent of dynamic typing.<p>Then I tried Haskell and realized that a <i>good</i> static typing system is <i>very</i> useful. It not only catches mistakes--I've worked on very language interpreters in both Python and Haskell, and I constantly made preventable mistakes in Python--but actually makes your code <i>more</i> expressive. Take the read function, for example. (It is basically the opposite of toString.) I can't think of any way of writing it in a dynamically typed language because it has to know what type it's supposed to be to work--it's polymorphic on its return type. And this is very useful: if you have a string, you can just read it in and it will be of whatever type you need (as long as you've defined how its read).<p>Haskell has some other advantages over Java (e.g. much more lightweight types and no messing about with classes and subclasses), but I think the important point is that static typing done right is not only safer but also sometimes more expressive than dynamic typing.",1330198562

The hypermedia isn't there so AI or spiders can navigate, it is there to reduce coupling.<p>--<p>A Rant follows. Disclaimer: I'm not an expert on the subject so feel free to correct me or anything.<p>The WWW itself is ""RESTful"". Even Hacker News is RESTful. You don't care about the URLs that show in your address bar. You don't construct them based on an ID-number on the side of each post. You just click around and submit forms.<p>With hypermedia, your consumer doesn't need to know about those specifics of URL construction. URLs are transparent. You just query for Resources and follow links.<p>YES, absolutely ZERO coupling is MUCH easier with boring CRUD-like stuff, such as Microsoft's OData, GData or AtomPub.<p>Maybe when you're writing a good consumer tuned for usability (like a Twitter client) you, app builder, will need to know some details on the service beforehand, but even then, having hypermedia would be cool.

Feynman shared his discovery with a group of people, one of whom (John Tukey) had a curiously different experience: while counting steadily, he could easily speak aloud, but could not read. Through experimenting and comparing their experiences, it seemed to them that they were using different cognitive processes to accomplish the task of counting time. Feynman was hearing the numbers in his head, while Tukey was seeing the numbers go by.<p>So while pushing around abstract symbols might be the way that you really grok things, I don't think this applies to everyone.  I have an undergrad math minor, and the only math class that I didn't get an A in and that I really struggled with was Linear Algebra.<p>I think it mostly had to due with excessive symbolic abstraction.  Matrix notation still really troubles me.  About 5 years after that Linear Algebra class that I struggled with, I was took a computer graphics class for a masters degree.  We were talking about the non-invertibility of some operation (I think it was about figuring out how far something was away given a 2d rendering of a 3d scene, where you have a degree of freedom in the scale, everything could be twice as large and twice as far away).  And that gave me a really intuitive understanding between matrix invertibility and full rank matrices.  I am sure that I would have done much better in a combined Linear Algebra/Computer Graphics class than I did in just the mostly symbolic and proof based Linear Algebra class.<p>So be careful in believing that the thought processes that obviously work well for you will also work well for others.",1330197838

I recently visited my high school to see what was happening in the 'new' computer programming class.

Codecademy's courses provide no videos, no lecture notes, rather they are programs themselves, guiding you through principles by having you code.""  I found a lot of these kids didn't understand basic programming concepts, such as the modulus operator (%).  It's tough to move forward when you don't grasp the small details.  I liked the fact that students were presented the opportunity to write code and see the results but I felt it was lacking instruction, the kind of detailed instruction provided by KhanAcademy.<p>And this is where Udacity excited me!

The problem is the cultural and family structures don't exist to help intelligent and otherwise-likely-to-succeed people from certain groups progress through the very long pipeline to being successful startup founders.  I'm just saying trying to apply late-stage correction (pushing for proportional representation in startup incubators, colleges, etc.) is the wrong place to work -- you can get by with much less expensive, much more fair interactions by starting a lot earlier.  KIPP will probably do more for minority representation in the startup world than anything at the incubator level, but it will take 15 years.<p>One of the things the military has done pretty well is racial (and geographic) integration, through treating everyone basically the same (after integration), and aggressively getting rid of organizational or structural racism.  That's different from startups, but does seem to support the idea that it's possible, given enough time.<p>Actually, most of the countries I've visited care more about ethnicity/race than the US, especially more so than silicon valley.

Are card manipulations that are almost impossible to detect, even when known and watched for considered ""in plain sight"", just because they don't happen ""out of frame"" to use Teller's term. If so, it isn't ""because you don't want to notice"", it's because you can't see them even if you're looking.<p>And what of the crafty moves that do happen in plain sight, but are genuinely missed due to misdirection (selective attention) [1]. This isn't because you don't want to notice  either.

I went into working with the real estate industry, particularly realtors. I now find myself really wanting to get into high tech because my personality clashes with a lot of my customers. For one, they are incredibly un-tech savy and 80% of them use some outdated windows computer with Internet Explorer 6 or something prehistoric.<p>I had to spend 30 minutes the other day explaining to someone how to download a picture and where it gets saved on her computer.<p>They also like to have meetings and conference calls on things that can be resolved with a 2 sentence email. There are also some things I'd like to be able to do like build relationships with my customers through social media and although many of them do use it, it's just not the same as interacting with a younger or more tech savy demographic.<p>So in the end, for my next business, I'm going to look towards finding a market where my customers are better suited with my personality and skills.

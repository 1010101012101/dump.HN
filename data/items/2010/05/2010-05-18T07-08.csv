Most cameras have a 1.6 multiplier that is the 50mm is as if it were a 80mm - nice prime for portraiture, a 75mm (film) prime would be even better.<p>Cheap plastic lenses are just that, cheap.  You might as well just buy a $100 point and shoot.  Zoom lenses are great if you have to be prepared for anything and don't have time to change prime lenses (don't forget dust, etc problems) and of course all those lenses are a bother to carry.  Trouble is that quality zoom lenses cost heaps.  Of course, you could try buying second-hand, but sometimes they have been knocked around and are worse than useless.<p>Unless you are on the move a lot, a tripod is a better option than expensive image stabilization lenses.  For absolutely shake free shots learn to use the self-timer to let the camera settle down after pressing the shutter release button.<p>Learn to focus manually, the auto-focus doesn't work best in some light conditions.

But they often exist in their own groups, and they find Python by themselves. There's no _why showing people cool stuff in a fun way, no 'hey use our deployment tool, it's easy and fun' in the Python world - or at least, a lot less than Ruby land.<p>What do you think of a meetup for people who make stuff, using Python?

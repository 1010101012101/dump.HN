It just shouldn't happen - the computer knows exactly what was inputed - why should it <i>ever</i> lose track of it.<p>The ""Save"" function is a carry-over from the time when storage was expensive and slow, and humans had to make decisions about what was worth saving. Now, computers generate a lot more useless logfiles that are saved forever than a human can possibly generate using a word processor, and yet we are asked to make a decision about if we really meant to put out inputs into a computer.<p>That shouldn't happen any more, and with good software it doesn't.<p>In Google Docs - for example - there is no ""Save"" function - it happens everytime you press a button. There is no ""Save As""; instead there is ""Rename.."", ""Make a Copy.."" and ""Download As.."" which perform the distinct functions rather than overloading ""Save As..""",1310103758

I don't see those tons of purple too often and it provides a nice contrast against the grey background.<p>And now some criticisms:<p>1) This page is very difficult to use with a screen reader/no mouse. Consequently, the sight impaired will have a whole lot of trouble using it. You may want to do some reading into the Americans with Disabilities Act.<p>2) The site is completely non-functional with Javascript turned off. Even the text on your contact form is out of alignment without Javascript. Thankfully, your drop down menu system appears to use CSS instead of JS - great work!<p>3) Your FAQ page would benefit from better typesetting. As it is, it looks quite crowded.<p>4) The right side of your FAQ page looks quite empty.<p>5) If I were you, I'd put a whole lot of work into your FAQ page. I found some of the answers a little hard to understand.<p>6) It is only available for use in the United States. I guess that means I broke your Terms of Service....please don't sue me. You might want to mention something that restrictive on your home page, especially since you snag location by default.<p>7) Your Terms of Service page needs something on the right hand side. So does your Privacy Policy.<p>8) I'm not keen on the position of the 'Share with Facebook' button on your home page. Personally, I'd try moving it down around 5px (I think) to center it against your menu, then right align it so you get a clean line down the right side.<p>9) Finally, I don't think your page makes a very effective use of white space - it seems crammed together and that makes taking it in, figuring out what it is, and actually using it rather difficult.",1310101827

I don't think 100 is much to ask. And I'm not saying it's a dealbreaker, just something that might mean you should investigate further.<p>(To give a more concrete example, I once realized that someone claimed to have gone to a particular college, but didn't have a single person on either FB or LinkedIn from that school in their friend lists. Doesn't that seem a bit fishy?)",1310101748

Perhaps chrome's versioning is not made apparent to the user, but I'm sure all of their competitors know what is going on.<p>Regarding anti-trust: Anti-trust laws are laws that are intended to prevent monopolistic measures. I posit in the article that by controlling both the client (chrome) and server (Google Docs, in addition to GMail, Google Search, et al) that Google is in a unique position to perform monopolistic actions.

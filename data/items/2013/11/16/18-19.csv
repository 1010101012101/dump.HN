6745924,comment,6743358,6744959,6,0,sologoub,,,"Americans are fascinated with race. It&#x27;s used as an explanation for practically every kind of social injustice. To me, economic situation is much more important here. After all, outside of a serious mental illness, a wealthy person will not go and try to break into someone else&#x27;s house.<p>There are cultural aspects that have developed to support certain behaviors within an economic setting, there is plain ignorance, but all these can be addressed with proper economic support for the impoverished populations.<p>In California, LA stands as the biggest source of the 3-strikers[1], order of magnitude larger than other urban centers. Part of this is the sheer size of the population, part of it is the size of the economic strata occupied by the majority of 3-strikers. Of the 6.5% (is this even accurate?) &quot;black people&quot; you reference, what % live in utter poverty? Of the 55% of non-black 3-strikers occupy the same strata?<p>I don&#x27;t have a source of these statistics, but to me it seems very intuitive that you will find that the vast majority come from the same economic situation, and race plays less of a difference than you might think.<p>As for the suburbs, I fail to see the reasoning - are you proposing that we limit the free choice of people of where they want to live? Most people I know who chose to live in suburbs and endure horrific LA traffic did so not because they do not want to be next to other races, they did it because they want their children to have a yard to play in and breath fresh air. Schools with a smaller classroom size are an issue too, but that goes back to the economic situation - large lots/more expensive houses result in greater tax income and therefore better schools.<p>Race is simply the most identifiable trait. Everything else, you have to actually work at finding root causes, this is why people gravitate to issues like that - it&#x27;s easy, it&#x27;s horrific and everyone immediately knows the solution. Unfortunately, that is also why we have made very little progress on the issues, despite making the subject socially-radioactive. Instead of feel-good/feel-bad rhetoric, it would be nice to see a tangible plan for improving the economic conditions in the blighted parts of LA for a change... If that happens, I&#x27;m willing to wager that crime will drop with poverty, and such horrific stories will become non-existent.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.lao.ca.gov/2005/3_strikes/3_strikes_102005.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lao.ca.gov/2005/3_strikes/3_strikes_102005.htm</a> (2005 analysis, so a bit out-dated)",1384627654

If it goes down for a few hours, hey, pretty much every mail server will retry for a few days, so you&#x27;re pretty much guaranteed to get all messages.\n* Set up your home mail server to use something like Mailgun or Mandrill to actually send messages.

6745833,comment,6745163,6745588,6,0,debergalis,,,"[core dev] If you like to think about your application starting with its API, I think you&#x27;ll really like learning more about DDP [1], the websocket JSON-based protocol that Meteor clients and servers speak.  This is one of my favorite parts of the stack.<p>Rich clients built against a REST API tend to need some sort of client-side cache so that clients can avoid repeated RTTs back to the server for data, and thus some sort of websocket-based invalidation system so that the server can push fresh data into that cache in real time.  That&#x27;s doable, but a total bummer for interoperability and shared tooling.  Since the implementation of those things is usually custom to each app, it&#x27;s rare to see one real-time app connected to another the way we can bolt server-based REST apps together.  And there&#x27;s no `curl` for this kind of endpoint.<p>DDP is actually quite simple.  The spec is just a couple pages of markdown.  It lets servers publish changing data sets to the client and it implements once-and-only-once remote procedure invocation.  It runs over a websocket or over SockJS.  Eventually we&#x27;ll also define a binary TCP/TLS mapping for use between servers.<p>When you write `Meteor.publish` in a Meteor server, you&#x27;re defining a real-time DDP endpoint, like a streaming version of GET.  The server makes the common cases easy -- publishing a realtime MongoDB query to a client is a one-line function in Meteor -- but you also have access to the low-level DDP messages if you want to do something more advanced like publishing the output of a GPS sensor or a stock ticker.<p>There aren&#x27;t any special bindings between Meteor clients and servers, just the standard DDP messages that go back and forth.  So you can implement either side of the wire using something else.  And there are some third-party implementations of both the client and server in the field now.  You can write a Meteor front-end against a Java DDP backend.  You can connect a native iPhone app to a Meteor backend.  Or you can have two Meteor server processes, one subscribed to the other.  (There&#x27;s been discussion of all these cases on the mailing lists.  We use server-to-server DDP heavily in Galaxy, the hosting product we&#x27;re working on.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/packages/livedata/DDP.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/packages/livedat...</a>",1384626501

My dad travels with juice/gel exceeding 3oz (with a note from his doctor). I&#x27;ve gotten a Costco-sized bottle of contact lens solution past TSA (so if you want to know how to sneak in some vodka...) One winter I was traveling a couple times a month with some terrible bronchitis+sinusitis issues and I had a gallon sized bag full of cough syrups and inhalers. Whatever. The only two things I remember TSA specifically tested from my bags from, at this point, hundreds of flights, is one mega sized bottle of purple drank (if you split liquid meds into a bunch of smaller but still bigger than 3oz bottles they don&#x27;t seem to care) and one bottle of shampoo.<p>Banning people from bringing liquids on board and halfheartedly enforcing the 3oz rule when they can be circumvented so easily even with TSA approval (see TSA precheck!) is so incredibly dumb it baffles my mind.<p>Oooh ooh bonus points: I put something like 10 quarts worth of homemade jam in my checked luggage on one flight and TSA didn&#x27;t even look at them (and good thing too, because they were all canned and I would have flipped out if the seals were broken).

Check out what works and do more of that. As far as I can tell, the best results are had by rehabilitation type systems.<p>* What I mean by this is it might be a tautology that someone locked up in prison forever can commit no more crimes, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s as simple as that. If you lock someone up:<p>a) You deprive their community of that person. Maybe their children will now become criminals.<p>b) You deprive their community of their spending power and work. Maybe it will become poorer.<p>c) They have the chance inside prison to share experiences with novice criminals and teach them how to become old hands, increasing crime when their cell-mates get out.<p>Now if that person is a negative on all the above values, maybe there is a point in not letting them out. Maybe they have broken homes, never work, and teach others about crime anyway. But that&#x27;s not the person I&#x27;m comparing them to.<p>I&#x27;m saying the criminal in their community has a negative effect on society. Putting them in jail makes it zero. Actually rehabilitating them makes it positive.<p>If we could get rehabilitation to work, everything gets better.

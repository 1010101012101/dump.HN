4932241,comment,4931906,4931906,3,0,alexobenauer,,,"I hear this from developers around me quite a bit. Almost always, the issue is not that you've lost interest in programming, but rather that you're discovering that what you are passionate about isn't programming at all, and that programming was simply a means to or a part of whatever it is you are actually passionate about; whatever it is that will actually make you happy.<p>For me, it was product development and design. I started writing code in middle school, and I really loved it. I pursued computer science in college, and while I did graduate with my b.s. in c.s., it was during college that I hit a similar slump. Over time, I realized it wasn't writing code that I was passionate about. In high school, I had to write code to implement product designs and different ideas that I wanted to innovate on. Programming was a means to what I was actually interested in. Now, I work developing products (not code), and designing UI's, and I love it. It took me a while to figure out that this is actually what I love, but once I figured it out, I was always in love with what I do. (Not just in love with what I do when it happens to be plugged in to what my strength, unbeknownst to me, actually was.)<p>I urge you, and anyone else hitting the same slump every now and then with writing code to think about when writing code is actually fun. What sets those times apart? When is it most enjoyable? Is there a pattern? Is it when you are also doing the design? Coming up with new features? Leading a team? Designing a developer tool or API?<p>Your strength and passion may lie elsewhere, and going through this thought exercise may help you uncover it.<p>Of course, I could be totally wrong; your situation may be completely different. Feel free to get in touch if you want to bounce around a bit of conversation surrounding this. My email's in my profile.",1355752777

It's interesting how a technology that is in fact revolutionizing manufacturing (CNC milling) gets very little attention compared to one that will, by all reasonable accounts, only ever be useful for prototyping or very limited production runs of small objects.

But what I'm not so sure about and what I wonder if it is worth the trouble making elaborate commits? It's the difference between anal committing and loose committing.<p>In the first style you ensure that your commit messages properly describe what bugs your checkin fixes, that it follows the formatting convention you have for writing checkin messages, that there are no extraneous whitespace changes producing unnecessary hunks and that you don't accidentally insert a big block of uncommented out code.<p>Loose committing is when you periodically commit the stuff you are working on. Several times per day, when you feel you've reached something good, you checkin what is in your repository and, at best, you write a comment like ""fixed the bug with bla"".<p>Of course, there are several possible shades of gray between totally loose and totally anal committing. What is the right strategy may very well vary depending on how many developers are involved in the project.<p>For me, I've found that loose works best for my own projects. Prettifying commits and thinking up good descriptions is annoying and can disrupt my flow. I can't be bothered to force myself to do it just ""because it's the right thing"" and I usually don't revisit old commits anyway. I'd definitely like to hear other developers thoughts on the issue though.",1355750423

Is it harder for startups that originate from smaller countries to succeed?<p>My argument towards this is that when first pushing a product to the market you usually don't have a huge marketing budget and have to rely on guerilla marketing or local connections, like local press, events or people you know.<p>If you live in a big (or big-ish) country, like USA, UK or even Poland, you probably have connections here and there that formed over time. And you can leverage those.<p>For example if you get into local press for Poland - your total population (max reach) is around 43 mil. people. Even if the sharing of the news stop around the borders (due to language barrier) - that's still a pretty impressive potential user base.<p>Try that in some small country, (e.g. Baltic states) - you get your max reach capped at around 3-4 mil. people.<p>And if you live in an English speaking country - you don't even have the language barrier, so something that guardian.co.uk features can easily move on to USA, Australia and eventually - the whole world.<p>So...

If you spend lots of time in the driver code, you most certainly won't be happy with Python, R, or Matlab, but then Cython (and possibly Numba at some point) help push this ""lots of time"" further and further down.<p>""all else fails"" is the starting point of pretty much everyone doing real work. What's your alternative here? Most of the time, specialized libraries will be both more convenient and more efficient than rolling your own with fine-grained concurrency/parallelism in Java or PyPy.",1355749579

The major leading cause of gun deaths in Australia is suicide, around 300 per year from among the ~750k gun owners in this country.<p>I agree that totalitarian governments have been the leading cause of death in the 20th century. But it's an orthogonal point. Look around: guns do not prevent tyranny. Neither do high explosives. What counts is institutions. The United States inherited a set of institutions (cultural norms, the rule of law) from the British that went a long way to assuring economic success and a culture of freedom.<p>So did Australia. Our freedom has never been guaranteed by the kind of constitutional mechanisms the USA has; it has always been reliant on culture and history. The freedom of the people of the United Kingdom is not guaranteed by any written constitution; it is reliant on culture and history. And so on and so forth. Widespread gun ownership does not banish shitty governments (ask a Saudi).<p>We are not going to agree, and nothing I say will change your mind.

Aside from the fact that anything available for sale to civilians will be both prohibitively expensive (1-2 orders of magnitude more expensive than a comparable semi-automatic weapon) and most likely an antique (only weapons manufactured before 1986 are available to civilians), the acquisition process itself is pretty arduous (e.g. FBI background investigation, signoff from head of local law enforcement, etc.).  From my understanding, these weapons are almost never used to commit crimes.<p>The real danger are handguns - something like 3/4s of gun deaths are from handguns.",1355749248

They're not catching <i>that</i> many criminals (or ""terrorists"") with it right now, and in order to have an effect like you describe they need to catch most if not all of them. Surveillance isn't a panacea like that (even if you ignore the freedom aspect), even with perfect total information awareness, there's a ceiling of efficiency.<p>The thing you describe, to run smoothly is just about the same amount of trouble and effort for a government, as it would be to rule with actual justice, civil liberties, privacy, etc.<p>The truth is, all this surveillance shit is NOT really about protecting the public and reducing crime. It may be useful but not <i>that</i> useful, definitely not billons-of-dollars useful, the amounts that are being invested in this tech. It's about the state protecting its place, keeping the status quo and people covering their asses. In a healthy country, those two goals are aligned.

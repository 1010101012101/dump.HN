29853,comment,29778,29822,0,0,brlewis,,,"As someone working alone, I find that not being able to bounce ideas off of a parter is not that much of a problem once you have users.  You can evaluate ideas based on what users are saying or doing, or just try them out and see what happens.  The real disadvantage is that it just isn't as much fun as working together.",1182443680

Too bad the group is not available on gmane, and the full archive is only in google, but if you have an NNTP provider (www.motzarella.org for example) you can read it with your newsgroup reader, although you get only the messages from the last month.<p>Dimiter ""malkia"" Stanev.\n",1182443515

29849,comment,29821,29848,0,0,Psyonic,,,"That is precisely what I have been doing.  I spend considerable amounts of time learning about web technologies and refining my skills, and it really has nothing to do with making myself employable.  On average I would rather experiment with Seaside than play a video game.\nI am 21, and actually already have considerable experience in the work field so far, but have been unsatisfied.  I think I would find a startup much more to my liking.  Perhaps I will have to follow your lead and develop a pet project into something impressive.",1182441909
29848,comment,29821,29821,0,0,thomas23,,,"Bottom-line, you need experience. I'm young, 22, but got my job as lead developer when I was 20 and in college because no one could argue with my experience. I don't mean you need to go and work for a dozen companies before you can get a job where the founders trust you. Do what I did, manufacture experience. I've written around 10 medium-large scale projects by myself, one being a social network that wowed the founder of my current company. <p>One thing I know for sure, school means almost nothing. It helps a lot but only when you spend the time learning as much as possible about web technologies. As well as developing and refining your skills as a web developer.\n",1182441669
29847,comment,29821,29821,0,0,Psyonic,,,"Another question for those that have already responded to this thread: What kinds of things would you be valuable to you in making a hiring decision? Personally I find resumes to be a weak indicator of abilities.  Not to say I don't have one, but I don't think a checklist is nearly enough.  Would you find a personal blog regularly updated with development related posts worthwhile?  Should I spend time learning (reading books, etc) or would I be better off getting a few small pet projects going?  In a world with no time limitations, I would like to do all of these things, but that just isn't practical (right now, at least).",1182441669

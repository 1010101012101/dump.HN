Or lobby Google to provide explicit configuration for syncing multiple folders.<p>> <i>I found the symlink solution to be quite elegant and never experienced any unexpected behavior.</i><p>It's anything <i>but</i> elegant! What happens, for instance if you drag and drop a folder into your synced folder, and unbeknownst to you this folder has a symlink in it to the root directory of the computer? Nothing good can happen, I assure you, if symlinks are synced transparently!<p>Additionally, I already heavily use symlinks for their intended purpose. E.g., I have lots of symlinks between files and folders to make it easier for me to find and navigate all my stuff. What happens if I want to have my folder ""my-lifes-work"", which is already a twisty maze of files, folders, and symlinks, and I want it synced between all my computers? If symlinks are synced opaquely, no problem: I just drop this into the synced folder, and everything is golden. If I drop this into a folder where links are synced transparently, who knows what hellish things result.<p>Maybe you think that Google shouldn't give a rat's ass about the needs of fellows such as myself, since I'm not in the mainstream, but symlinks were invented for people such as me. Not for programs to hijack for completely different purposes.<p>I actually did drop ""my-lifes-work"" into my Windows Live Mesh folder. Live Mesh is a lot like Dropbox and Google Drive. This actually works fine because Live Mesh ignores the symlinks. I.e., if A is my original computer which has the symlinks, and B is my second computer which didn't have ""my-lifes-work"" on before now, then after syncing, B ends up with everything that A has, only without the symlinks. This is okay for me, since I wrote a program to sync the symlinks out of band. This is less that ideal, but it's better than nothing.<p>Oh, for the day, when stuff such as this will just work the way that the gods intended it to!",1335327296

Human perception is a fickle thing and does not always follow the logical path one might expect.<p>Consider the uncanny valley, where adding fidelity to an image actually reduces the perceived pleasure rather than increasing it.<p>In my experience, even the jump from 24fps to 30fps is enough to lose the feeling of 'magic' that people are used to in the movies. There's a reason that most non-reality, non-sitcom TV shows are filmed in 24fps rather than 30fps (the native framerate of television).<p>It may be that the movie industry will find a way to make movies that take advantage of the characteristics of 48fps, but it's not going to be like sticking a new video card into your rig and receiving an instant experience improvement. The fundamental way that movies present themselves (photography, scene design, set design, storytelling) will have to change.",1335326760

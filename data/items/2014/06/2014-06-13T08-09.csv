I didn&#x27;t really notice the MS bashing.<p>The issue with the Reactive Manifesto is that it is largely waffle. There are styles of programming that account for time, such as functional reactive programming. They tend to have formal definitions, or at least concrete implementations, so one can make objective statements about them. The Manifesto on the other hand is vague and full of platitudes. It&#x27;s great for the Pointy-haired Boss, but there is little of substance than one can discuss in any objective manner.<p>[Update] I can understand how it&#x27;s off-putting to listen to the presentation without this background.",1402649516

In both cases they seek to make masses happy enough to maintain their status quo.<p>On a related note, if we look at corporations as nations with citizens being their employees, then actually they work in a more similar way to a government - they usually provide healthcare, define certain laws (as in, rules and dependencies within the corporation itself) and seek to make their employees happy (or else employees will go to other company). And additionally people don&#x27;t get so zealously protective about their corporations as they do about nations, so maybe rather than waging wars they would choose to simply change the corporation they are in.<p>Well, I certainly don&#x27;t say we should make a change in this direction though; it&#x27;s simply a thought I find interesting, how corporations provide to their employees some of the things similarly as the government does (and sometimes provide even though the government should, but doesn&#x27;t).",1402647521

And its really these TWO issues that make the american politics more partisan than rest of the world.<p>A) Election system is strongly geared towards creating two party. When new party has gained enough support it replaces one of the previous two parties at the control, and there is new TWO parties which compete each other. Compare that to systems in which allows smaller parties to get seats. For examble in Finland there are 3-4 big parties that total 60-70% of seats and rest goes to smaller parties.\nThat means to pass anything you pretty much have to have two big parties agreeing on the matter and either third big agreeing or some small parties agreeing.<p>B) Executive branch is Winner takes all.\nIn Finland the parliament(legislative branch) selects Executive branch and because no party has half or near half seats there is need to be enough parties agreeing on the matter. So if you are REALLY uncompromising you NEVER get to be part of executive branch EVEN if you become the biggest party of elections, since you didn&#x27;t get more than half the seats anyway in multiparty system. The biggest party gets first attempt to create the cabinet, but they still need to get enough others onboard. The cabinet pretty much needs majority of legislative branch to support it. They need a program which over half the legislative branch supports and usually give seats in the cabinet to enough other parties that have over 50% of parliament. If biggest party fails to create agreement of the program the responsibility of trying to form the cabinet goes to next largest party. And if all else fails parliament may agree a minority government OR even putting some professional bureaucrats instead of politicians in top positions of executive branch. Both are extremely rare situations in here.",1402647428

7887835,comment,7886266,7886692,7,0,waps,,,"Please note that the post gives an extremely bad impression. First of all, pareto efficiency and nash equilibria exist both in capitalism and other economic systems. And the obvious alternative economic system : centrally planned economies, are very much nash equilibria (if they are stable at all).<p>But the second impression he gives is also very wrong. By definition, everyone is a &quot;selfish dickhead&quot; both in Nash equilibria interactions and pareto efficient interactions. This is a basic tenet of economy, that people &quot;in the limit&quot; act in their own self interest, never out of altruism. Why ? Simple : if anyone is systematically altruistic, he/she will be eliminated from the game (meaning end up dirt poor, imprisoned or dead or otherwise prevented from participating in the system). The predictions this makes are extremely accurate, and have been for millenia.<p>Always assume nobody is altruistic, ever, for any reason.<p>The real difference between nash equilibrium transactions and pareto efficient transactions is this :<p>nash equilibrium : A and B, both &quot;selfish dickheads&quot;, transact. If A gets a good deal, B got screwed.<p>Pareto efficiency : A and B, both &quot;selfish dickheads&quot;, transact. A and B got a good deal.<p>This is why the &quot;always cooperate&quot; strategy in the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma game is not actually pareto efficient : it is obviously possible for the other guy to screw you. If it were a pareto efficient strategy, it wouldn&#x27;t be possible to take advantage of this.<p>In capitalism, if there is a pareto-efficient strategy to transact, people following that tactic will quickly increase in numbers, and therefore the whole society will become pareto efficient. This happens BECAUSE everyone is a &quot;selfish dickhead&quot;, not because some people are morally superior to others. That fact is why every economist is so impressed with capitalism. Capitalism is a system that can succeed, for everyone, in the presence of selfish dickheads. A centrally planned economy, by contrast, necessarily either destabilizes entirely (not good for anyone, unless you truly believe in anarchism), or turns into a Nash equilibrium over time.<p>Capitalism is a learning algorithm, or a &quot;crowd-sourcing&quot; algorithm with money as &quot;karma&quot; : it makes sure that resource allocations are decided by people who previously made good allocations. That is of course what people really have against capitalism :<p>1) &quot;abusers&quot;/&quot;power mongers&quot;/... : complain about capitalism because they can&#x27;t keep abusing the system. If they use their resources to force certain outcomes that wouldn&#x27;t normally be achieved (e.g. personal power), that can only work for so long.<p>2) moralists: complain about capitalism because it&#x27;s amoral, like any learning algorithm. It does not care if any action improves or destroys other people, or which factors determine success, merely if it increases an abstract &quot;value&quot; concept. If they have resources (e.g. because you have an islamist state), it requires a constant large cost to force any non-optimal outcome (e.g. not letting women work). Needless to say this is perceived by the moralists as capitalism fighting allah (when of course it&#x27;s really reality itself that&#x27;s at odds with allah), and then they usually just grab the weapons.<p>If there ever was a &quot;true&quot; religion, it&#x27;s trivial to see capitalism would quickly grow it, not work against it. &quot;Surprisingly&quot; this has not happened yet, one can only wonder why.",1402646913

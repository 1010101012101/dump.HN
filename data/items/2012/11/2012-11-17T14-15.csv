4798188,comment,4797036,4797555,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"I think the thing that's going to fight you in that case is how expensive elections have become. Part of the reason we have more nationalized parties now is that they provide economies of scale in fundraising, and provide cross-regional campaign funds for races in poorer areas whose representatives nonetheless get the same number of votes in Congress once elected.<p>The upshot is that for a regional party to get elected, they have to build a seven to eight figure campaign war chest per seat, because the second it looks like they have a good chance of winning, the national parties will pull a Brinks truck full of nationally-sourced money into their own candidate's campaign headquarters.<p>And while it's certainly true that money alone doesn't guarantee results (see: Linda McMahon, etc.), if you're running a campaign on $500,000 and your opponent is spending $50,000,000, you're in serious trouble. And it's difficult for a regional party that can't even guarantee the ability to filibuster to raise that kind of cash.<p>What I think we're more likely to see is what we've been seeing: Not separate parties, but independents with their own personal wealth who are willing to spend it to get themselves elected, and who have enough to make it a fair fight when their money is undiluted by multiple races. The problem is that then the candidates are self-selected and there is no guarantee that they'll agree with each other much less any of the electorate.",1353164274

4798182,comment,4796106,4798072,3,0,caw,,,"There's a difference between free information and compiled free information with a bit of extra. You pay for the premium of having it all put together and not having to spend the time to go find it all. Why buy a programming book? There's lots of tutorials on the internet. Still, many people buy books.<p>If I were completely new to a topic, like copywriting, I would probably look for a book on the topic, rather than blogs. That's because I'd spend more time trying to find free material that's good (there's a lot of free crap out there), than to buy a pre-compiled book from a reputable source.<p>I agree with you that the materials have to justify their price. I've purchased a $99 information product before that was total crap, and the exact same content on the same person's website, just reformatted. In that case there's no justification, no added value. I don't know what books you're talking about to determine if they're actually any good or not, but to charge for what's normally ""free"" information there has to be added value.<p>Maybe there is a rash of startups with inflated pricing without any added value. However, as soon as the first competitor comes in that truly adds value for the same price (or less), then everyone will jump to it.",1353164160

4798170,comment,4797825,4797944,2,0,harshreality,,,"Lacking cryptographic hashes used by most DVCS software, SVN repositories need some external mechanism to be pretty sure the source repository hasn't been compromised.  For instance, one might have snapshots of the SVN tree taken every week.<p>It's much easier with git or hg, even in the single-master-repo model, even if all developers are using the CVS gateway so they don't have local copies of commit history.  All such a project would need in order to protect against compromise (ignoring physical redundancy) is a backup git or hg repo, kept offline except for periodic pulls.  As long as there are no warnings about upstream rebases, and you trust all visible commits, then everything's fine[1].<p>With SVN, as long as there's no built-in cryptographically secure way to connect one snapshot to the next when backing up SVN repos, determining the existence of a backdoor requires comparing entire backup SVN repos against the live main repo.  Even if sufficient backups exist, the process is slow and requires taking the main SVN repo offline if there's any chance of a root compromise.<p>[1] Caveat 1: in any RCS, there could be backdoors masquerading as legitimate-looking commits if the attacker had commit access.  Caveat 2: The security is subject to the cryptographic security of SHA-1.<p>In this FreeBSD case, if they're certain the svn repo wasn't compromised, all they have to do is validate the checkout on the two compromised machines against the svn repo.",1353163900

4798161,comment,4797461,4797461,2,0,yason,,,"Putting the specifics of this case aside, the whole question underlines once again the questionable sanity behind copyright and intellectual property. The corner cases like these are a signal that the copyright thinking isn't entirely in alignment with reality. With physical goods it's very clear: if an employee had gone rogue and given off a prototype device built by the company, any resale of that device would naturally be illegal (it's illegal to buy and sell stolen goods) and the device could eventually be returned to the company.<p>However, with bits, things are different. Bits can be copied, they can't be stolen, and bits aren't unique things whose possession can be controlled. Thus, the idea of copyright is to ""own"" the copyrighted works so as to control making copies of it. The company tried to assert that it owns the library and extrapolate from there that they could control the bits that represent copies of the library. But if the thing companies intend to control is the idea or ""the works"" instead of the physical bits then we're faced with another dilemma.<p>Consider if the leaked thing was a trade secret, which is an idea with no physical presentation. The trade secret was published without permission by a rogue employee and thus it wouldn't be a secret any longer, then how could the company possibly claim it <i>could be restored</i> somehow? How could anyone who had read about the trade secret explicitly unmemorize it? There are no physical copies or bits to destroy, the idea would simply live in peoples' minds and eventually travel to the company's competitors. The cat's out of the bag, what can you do.<p>I think that in this case, the only plausible view of what actually happened is just that. The culprit is the employee who should be liable for the damages if it turns out that he actually did publish the source code without a permission. (Based on the comments even verifying that is still uncertain.) Similarly, if an employee smuggles in GPLv3 code in to the company's codebase then the company can't just shrug that off, and must release their proprietary source code as GPLv3.<p>Both are quite harsh conclusions. It seems that for any company larger than a few dozen people would eventually bump into one of these two cases. Employees would have to require written permission from their managers to release source code. (What if their managers didn't have the permission to give that permission?) Companies would have to audit all new source code before adding it to their version control system. (Nearly an impossible task unless commit lag of months would be considered agile in their line of business.)<p>In practice, things don't workneither way, as long as copyright is removed from the realm of bits, data, and software and the concept of intellectual ""property"" is disintegrated from the beginning. WHen companies stop relying on those delusions and base their business on things that actually work on real life, they are relieved of much suffering.",1353163530

What it attempts to do is simulate the actual way someone would turn a page in a large book, such as a dictionary, with lots of thin pages.  I would argue that the technical way of implementing this would warrant a patent (utility) more so than the simple depiction of a thing that people naturally do with books.  In no way is this <i>design</i> unique to Apple; there is already prior art from the way people turn pages in books.  The choice to depict realistic page turning on an ebook reader is not artistically novel.  From a video game perspective, this is like patenting the idea of showing a game world from an isometric point of view.  This is a bad patent.<p>Now, I would agree with you that the NY Times article does exaggerate the impact of this patent.  Apple has not patented the page turn, instead they have patented a particular realistic way of showing turning pages.  In theory, Amazon could implement a page turn style where someone grabs the top corner of the page instead of the bottom and get around this patent.",1353161971

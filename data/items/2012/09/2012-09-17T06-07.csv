Let's say you instead have the choice of 5 binary attributes, with any choice of attributes being available.  Your five choices have now selected one of 32 products.<p>Now imagine you have to choose 5 binary attributes, but certain combinations of those attributes are not available.  On paper, your choice could be said to be easier, since the product range is smaller, but the inconsistency forces you to have to consider every one of the 25 combinations (for example), and your brain explodes.",1347865159

Remember, when Jobs came back on board and made the decision to pivot to Unix, Apple was roughly 90 days from bankruptcy. Apple of 2000 was not the fearsome behemoth that Apple of 2012 is.<p>At the time, there were many commercial Linux distributors - Red Hat, Mandrake, SuSE all spring to mind - and any one of them could have beaten Apple to the punch in offering a Unix desktop environment that was easy to use and, for lack of a better term, <i>pretty</i>. They didn't, though. Why not? I think the need to build on top of X is one thing that hampered Linux desktop environments when competing with OSX.",1347865055

It cost $120/month or so, which is definitely affordable (you may have to make a choice though - do you really need a cell phone with a data plan, or cable TV?). Many people bad-mouth Kaiser, even though it is an NPO, for their service, but I actually had good experiences with them (including a surgery). Our healthcare system actually <i>is</i> pretty great, if you do not believe me try getting a major surgery done in another country.  We do need to work on reducing costs (particularly the cost of drugs and medical equipment), but there will always be a certain cost for healthcare until AI takes over (it already is doing accurate diagnoses, if you have trouble believing that).  Many people make the mistake that healthcare is a ""right"" -- it is actually a commodity, like food, or trash service, or...you name it.  I'm not against universal healthcare, but the money for it has to come from somewhere, and maybe our government is not the best solution for it given their track record of screwing up budgets.",1347864986

Unlike XCB, which is machine generated and (partially) formally verified, Xlib has had bugs at a whole different scale.<p>> By the way thank you for taking your time and writing those docs, being there isn't much on XCB as it is. Maybe you can talk some sense into the XCB guys to take a couple weeks of and document XCB properly.<p>XCB is a machine generated library based on X11 specifications.

The best advice I could give you is read Foer's book first, and then you should know what elements of the art of memory you should pursue further. Oh, after you finish Moonwalking with Einstein, you'll probably want to start building memory palaces, and this post has a good suggestion for creating new ones: <a href=""http://www.michaelcorayer.com/2011/03/31/resource-for-memory-palaces"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.michaelcorayer.com/2011/03/31/resource-for-memory...</a><p>[1] Even without jumping into the amazing world of memory palaces, you can still take away a lot of little gems from the book, including seemingly obvious things that you probably never bothered to think of.

On the 13th of Sept. 2012, I tried to make a payment using PayPal for my server on hetzner. For some reason, my debit card doesn't work with PayPal and I was unable to make the payment. On saturday, 15th Sept. 2012, I got an email from PayPal asking me to rate my experience specifically for that purchase (attempt). Naturally, I was critical of the service in the survey. This morning, 17th Sept., I got an email from PayPal, stating that my account has now been limited because they found my PAN no. to be invalid. (PAN no. is like a unique number that the IT dept. of India gives to all Indians. PayPal India requires that you add a valid PAN no. to your account. More info about PAN here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_account_number). Now, I had added my PAN no. about 6-7 months back or so. It was not an issue then. How can it suddenly be invalid now? I followed the link to update my PAN no. and the PAN no. listed there is 100% correct. I can't update it, because it won't let me add the same PAN again. I have sent an email to paypal support to rectify this situation at the earliest. I don't really want to accuse PayPal of doing something like this because of a bad review, but the timing of it is suspicious. Is it just a system glitch or one of the support staff extracting revenge because he got yelled at because of my review? I'll know when I get a response I guess.",1347861755

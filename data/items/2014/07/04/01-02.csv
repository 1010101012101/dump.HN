7986899,comment,7986800,7986800,11,0,majormajor,,,"The bigger ethical question seems to me to be that you&#x27;re taking something the restaurant chooses to offer as a free convenience, without price-discrimination, and turning it into a game of &quot;who will pay the most to go to this restaurant.&quot;<p>Yes, you say you&#x27;ve started out small, with manual phone usage, etc. But then you go on to say: &quot;So in the interest of ethics and fairness, I want to talk to restaurants about working with them directly on a better reservation system.&quot; Sounds like you want to scale it, and make money off of it yourself, after all.<p>Whereas it seems to me that for high-demand restaurants the manual approach, exists that way <i>because</i> it won&#x27;t scale. Anyone can get a reservation, if they&#x27;re willing to wait a few weeks, it doesn&#x27;t matter what they&#x27;re willing/able to pay. And once you automate that, how do you keep it from being abused and effectively turning into a sort of demand tax? In which case the restaurant could be pocketing that money themselves by simply making the cost of dining there that high in the first place, but if they didn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s probably because they didn&#x27;t want to restrict so heavily based on spending ability. (Well, and because pricing/markets is tricky, and who knows if it would&#x27;ve been successful initially at a higher price... this part is just speculation on my end.)",1404439168

In 1995, if you&#x27;d wanted to implement one of today&#x27;s websites, you might have written a Tcl/Tk script that users could download and run.  Tk solved pretty well all the problems people are talking about here in the 90s; it even had a safe mode for running untrusted scripts.  But users in the 90s would have regarded as crazy any suggestion that they download and run random Tcl scripts from every site they visited!  Lots of them turned off the early versions of Javascript, which couldn&#x27;t do much apart from formatting tweaks.<p>Is the killer feature of CSS and Javascript simply that they undermined the frog&#x27;s security assumptions so gradually that it stayed in the pot until it boiled?",1404439098

7986877,comment,7985741,7986357,2,0,williamcotton,,,"I disagree. I think that the music isn&#x27;t good enough and that&#x27;s why no one is listening to it. I think that because the entire industry fell apart that the specialization that resulted in the great music of the past has been fractured.<p>The first main issue is that without an functioning ecosystem artists are forced to do everything themselves. When there were profits to be made off of recorded music all sorts of middle-men would take it upon themselves to make money for themselves while generating enough income for people to have music creation be a profession. These days you won&#x27;t find as many band managers because there isn&#x27;t very much in the way of profits. This goes for everything else in the ecosystem.<p>Part of this is due to losing the main way that musicians have profited, that is by selling records and by playing live music. Live music has been under assault since the beginning of the recorded music era. By the peak of the recording industry touring music was mainly looked at as a loss leader and were basically seen as just a way to drum up publicity for record sales. Most people did and continue to stay home and listen to recorded music instead of going to live music. At one point in the time the only way to hear music was by being around while it was performed.<p>The god&#x27;s honest truth is that most intelligent and talented people are going in to other creative industries and contemporary music is suffering. I see more naturally talented musicians writing code than I see playing music and the main reason is because smart people won&#x27;t work towards a career in an industry that is caught in a death spiral.<p>The tools aren&#x27;t what matter.  Music made with little training, experience, and passion is still shitty music even if it has sonic characteristics that were incredibly expensive just 20 years ago.<p>Good music is intelligent and aware of it&#x27;s purpose. Good music is carefully constructed and performed with trained expression. Good music communicates intent and satisfies the needs of an audience.<p>The amateurs are not good enough for the public and so the public is ignoring them and instead listening to the professional music of the very recent past that still has a message and form that continues to make sense.<p>Pretty soon society will move far enough from this era that new stories and new modes of expression will be demanded and a new crop of artists will be happy to supply it. Hopefully a viable economic ecosystem will support their efforts.",1404438618
7986876,comment,7986612,7986612,13,0,taeric,,,"I&#x27;m not really sure I understand what the point of this message is.  The point of separation between CSS and HTML is not that &quot;designers&quot; are idiots.  Nor is it that developers are poor designers.  The idea is strictly to keep the data separate from any other concern.  This is broken all of the time by all sorts of grid based elements and such.  But the idea does seem decent, if a touch naive.<p>That is, to Spolsky&#x27;s credit, the point of HTML being completely layout free is supposed to be the compelling feature.  And it roughly works for basic documents.  I&#x27;m actually convinced it could work decently for more complicated layouts if absolute positioning were more understood by developers and designers.<p>Are there better ways to go?  Certainly.  I&#x27;m particularly fond of the way that LaTeX gets things done.  Though, that is far from a &quot;safe&quot; environment.  (For example, you should probably never just up and run a .tex document on your computer without first scanning it yourself.)  Also, it is worth noting that efforts are usually made to separate style from content there.  (Not sure what the overall verdict is on those at the moment.  But they do exist.)<p>At the end of the day, though, the dream is still a language where you can edit one file to change the way something looks on render, and another to change what it contains.  Any language that lets you do both in one place will result in you doing both in one place.  Such that it becomes very problematic to change the look of something without changing what is in it.  And vice versa.<p>Right?",1404438602

7986871,comment,7983627,7986652,1,0,goodcanadian,,,"What I suspect nawitus is referring to involves the read noise of a CCD. There is always some low level noise involved in reading out a CCD. If this noise dominates, which may be the case for amateur astrophotography, it can explain the noise difference between a single exposure and stacking an equivalent number of shorter exposures.<p>If for the sake of illustration, the read noise is 10 counts and the signal for a 1 second observation is 10 counts, you will have a signal to noise of 1. Stacking 10 of these will give you a signal to noise of ~3 (square root of 10). Conversely, for the 10 second observation, you will have 100 counts for a signal to noise of 10.<p>However, there are other sources of noise, and instruments at major observatories are generally designed such that the read noise is not the dominant source of error either through more sensitive detectors or gathering more light (a bigger telescope or larger pixels) or some other means. If even a short exposure constitutes 1000000 counts, the difference between one 10s exposure and ten 1s exposures will be negligible.",1404438518

It is always possible to wrongfully judge someone, but it was never a valid or acceptable outcome (&quot;It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer&quot; - Blackstone). We accept that spam filters give false positives (not to mention that one person&#x27;s spam is another person&#x27;s opportunity), so I think comparing the justice system to detecting spam is a mistake, and more over that a goal of &quot;prevention&quot; itself is a red herring.<p>The goal of prevention encourages us to accept lower thresholds of guilt probability, and that is wrong. In other words, if prevention is an end, then it is worth deliberately (rather than accidentally) restricting innocent people on the basis of virtually any nonzero probability of guilt. 80% &quot;guilty&quot; by association (for using Tor for example), 45%, etc, would all be enough to justify legal action - and the thresholds would certainly depend on whoever is in power and has access to the database that week. This is a very different model than presuming innocence, and having not only a goal of 0 false-positives, but also providing satisfaction when the justice system is in error.<p>I think today we are mostly talking around the fact that a crime has to have <i>been committed</i> in order for it to <i>deserve</i> to be punished, and that, for that reason, prevention cannot be a valid goal in itself (but it&#x27;s nice when it happens).<p>Rationalizing surveillance as a tool to &quot;prevent&quot; rather than to justly punish wrongdoers (which centralized surveillance does not do <i>because</i> it is centrally operated, due to the conflict of interest; everyone owning a camcorder on the other hand...) implies that the central database needs to go IMHO (and that individuals need to be empowered instead).",1404438204

But it seems to be a minority opinion; most web developers seem to live in this weird cognitively dissonant state where the HTML DOM+CSS is always the right tool for the job because it theoretically allows for platform-independent layout to &quot;any&quot; browser while then spending most of their time dealing with getting their layouts to actually work on about a handful of real-world browsers which all treat the same layout code differently (in ways from subtle to large); resulting in piles of frameworks, pre-processing systems and general hackery to get everything working, mostly, most of the time.<p>If there were a second toolset that were more rationally designed to solve the real-world problems of modern web apps, giving you layout via binding similar to what you see in Adobe Flex, WPF, Qt/QML, etc (not advocating any of those as the specific answer, just stating that I think they are all individually more sane than HTML/CSS/JS for app/UI layout) and just accepted the fact that the vast majority of websites are designed to be laid-out in a fairly constrained way (while still allowing for responsive layout for different sizes/dpis) I think web technology would be a lot less terrible.<p>And just to get it out of the way, there are some good hacky solutions that help the problem I described, like React.js, Angular, Dart, etc, but they are all built on a shaky foundation which always manages to show through because we&#x27;re stuck with HTML/CSS/JS.",1404435896

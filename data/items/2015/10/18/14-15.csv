10408350,comment,10407865,10407865,0,0,cjslep,,,"> missing one of the nation’s largest nuclear power plants by less than two miles<p>I was fortunate to work for Dr. Twisdale, one of a handful of people (if not the only man) who provides wind hazard engineering support for nuclear power plants looking to renew their license. The biggest division are the two kinds of wind examined: tornadic versus straight-line gusts (thunderstorms, hurricanes, etc). What winds up being the most vulnerable are support buildings to the nuclear power plant and not the plant itself.<p>The most surreal experience working for him was on a NIST contract where I had to examine a lot of data about the Joplin, Missouri 2011 tornado. Normally, the numbers of engineering hide the personal touch of impacting people&#x27;s lives, but examining various videos and reports really energized my younger self as working on a high-impact project. The NIST report starting on page 6 really is brutal to read [0]. Then there is the National Geographic documentary which really captures the human toll and the resilience of the survivors [1]. Then there is the video that tourists (I believe?) were taking when they crossed the tornado&#x27;s path twice [2]. Then there is the video of their brand-new middle school at the time, which security footage captured the devastation [3]. What made this particular tornado devastating was the fact that it hit Joplin&#x27;s major hospital which serviced the region, and took that hospital offline.<p>> “There is virtually no literature on that at all,” Knox told me when I posed this question to him, “but I will give you my guess.”<p>That is because most engineering modeling is concerned with the creation of &quot;missiles&quot;, such as a telephone pole going through someone&#x27;s wall. For that there is plenty of literature, and even a single certified code by the NRC: TORMIS [4] (Written in Fortran 77 I believe).<p>Overall, wind engineering is incredibly tricky but very rewarding when done right. Sadly, it is not the &quot;hip&quot; nor most popular career paths.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.nist.gov/manuscript-publication-search.cfm?pub_id=915628"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nist.gov/manuscript-publication-search.cfm?pub_id...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG2DTAzZAzw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG2DTAzZAzw</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CburjPYmSdo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CburjPYmSdo</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64covicCcIY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64covicCcIY</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML0802/ML080230578.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML0802/ML080230578.pdf</a>",1445179482

The programmer&#x27;s job is to program.  Expecting them to also deal with details of legality and morality (beyond grossly obvious things like hard coding dosage limits into medical equipment) is just wishful thinking.<p>That&#x27;s the kind of talk that people want to hear. &quot;Oh the developers were given shitty instructions, they shouldn&#x27;t have listened&quot; but talk is cheap.  Stop to consider the implications of that sort of second guessing.  Obviously things get wacky at both extremes but when you give someone a spec to meet you need to have an expectation that it will meet that spec.  Our industry is built upon millions of black boxes that meet I/O spec sure having the developers turn around and say &quot;we changed you spec because it was killing polar bears&quot; comes with a much larger can of worms than just implementing what you&#x27;re told to implement and accepting that it might not be morally agreeable and getting on to the next thing.<p>There&#x27;s a reason people aren&#x27;t all generic worker bees.

Currently upscaling is in the rise again with 4K TVs. Back in the days they made some incredible chip solutions, sold them expensively to Sony, Samsung and similar. Sony realized they can, with all of their resources (super-HD movie database) make incredible upscalers.<p>Just imagine that Sony has stored whole movie The Walk (distributed by Sony Pictures) in your TV in 4K resolution, the moment this movie is displayed on your screen through some lower resolution sources, they find it in the database and display the 4K content. Of course, that&#x27;s highly inneficient and memory intensive, thus, they use statistical models to efficiently store movie material and have fast chips to quickly approximate the real upscale.<p>This will then, if the sample (number of movies) is high enough, work well on all of the movie content.",1445177201

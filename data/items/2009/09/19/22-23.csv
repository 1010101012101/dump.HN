Be warned, though, that it's one or two chapters worth of technical detail. The rest goes to motivating the subject and exploring its philosophical implications.

832414,comment,831676,832239,0,0,San,,,"Sure his method sounds easy, but are the results actually worth anything? It looks like an over-simplified version of ACT-R, with some made-up cost values. To me, this has no advantages over my gut feeling on usability; it's just that the numbers add some false sense of reliability.<p>For actual design decisions, I'd much prefer a method that has developed for thirty-some years, is based on actual cognitive models and has been empirically validated.<p>Besides, it's not that difficult to use. Building and testing your interface in CogTool would take you about an hour the first time, but it is easy to learn. You can even import HTML and record your actions. The results are pretty accurate, and you get automatic interface optimization (e.g. on widget size, location, types) too boot.<p>So, the author had a nice idea, but it has been done already. (At least for the user testing, the accurate results, the ""codification"" and the books; I don't know about the consulting company.)",1253400635

832408,comment,832176,832341,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Agreed.  I really enjoyed AOLServer.  It was rock solid, really fast and reasonably resource efficient, did everything we needed for our particular deployment, and was reasonably well-documented.<p>But, it also had some limitations that made it less promising.  It was intimately tied to Tcl, which is, let's be honest, not growing in popularity, had some old school architectural choices that would limit extensions and be hard to overcome (Apache had a lot of the same issues early in its life, but overcame them through brute force...when there are hundreds of active developers, all problems get smaller).  It was designed for a very specific purpose, and it showed.  So, I don't think it's a codebase I would consider spending time or effort on, if I didn't have really strong reasons for sticking with it.",1253400340

832401,comment,832330,832330,0,0,idm,,,"Like most stories, there are two sides to the issue.<p>It seems like the P2P tech was a big ""insider info"" advantage that enabled Volpi to close the deal.  The fact that he knew Skype could be implemented without the P2P backend was reassuring enough to the investors that they purchased Skype.<p>My understanding is that the very fact Volpi had that information is kindof sketchy, kindof ""insidery.""  In other words, Skype might never have been sold if the buyers didn't already know they could cut out the P2P backend, but they would never have had that knowledge if Volpi hadn't worked so closely with Skype's tech.",1253400051

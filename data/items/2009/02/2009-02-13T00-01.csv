The proper way to ""explain"" or ""comment"" a complex regular expression is not to include a single line comment near it, but to use the /x modifier that allows you to ""extend your patternâ€™s legibility by permitting whitespace and comments"".  That is, of course, assuming you're using a language where regular expressions are first class types and has syntax to support regular expressions as literals (if you have to include your regular expression in a quoted string, your language doesn't), and uses PCRE.",1234486543

There is really no middle ground. And for the ""serious"" problems, its usually cheaper to replace the whole motor, than to do the repairs.<p>Granted that mostly applies to japanese cars. You drive a BMW and to replace an engine will cost you 10 grand. While even the most rare JDM swaps will run you at most 5K.<p>For example, one guy I know never changes the oil on his daily driver civic. Why? Because he figured out that its cheaper for him to replace an engine every 80K miles, than it is to spend the money on an oil change.",1234486414

479251,comment,478807,478952,0,0,geebee,,,"It's also very important to note that the terms of the H1B would disallow an ""immigrant"" from quitting his job and starting a company, because his legal presence in the US is contingent on remaining in the good graces of his employer.  The H1B says ""we'll allow you to come here to work for Google, but we won't allow you to come here to start a company that competes with Google.""  That said, it sounds like you don't like this aspect of the H1B visa either - you would probably support a system that preserves more freedom for the guest worker.<p>Lastly, I think you are using ""smart, hard-working people"" ambiguously.  We don't allow hundreds of thousands of foreign lawyers into the US every year.  While health care does award some H1B's, Medicine and Dentistry also act as gatekeepers that ensure Americans who pursue these fields are not replaced en masse with foreign nationals.  Of course, real estate agents, mortgage brokers, flight attendants, plumbers, meter maids, and almost every other sector of the economy isn't targeted with a work visa.<p>Now, there's so much work to do in high tech that we still may get some Americans in the field.  But we still create a relative disincentive to Americans when we allow targeted visas in science and engineering.  After all, an American who pursues a law degree doesn't have to compete with foreign lawyers for jobs and clients.  But an American who pursues a graduate degree in engineering most definitely does.  Do we really want to discourage our citizens from engineering degrees and direct them toward law and other non-technical fields?<p>The answer may actually be ""yes.""  We can get engineers more cheaply from overseas, so we have decided, as a nation, to staff these positions with non us-citizens, and encourage our own citizens to pursue other degree paths and professions.  But I think this would be a terrible idea, since a robust, home grown engineering and science profession is crucial to the economic health and security of the United States.",1234486402

479246,comment,479165,479165,0,0,dasil003,,,"This article is fairly well-balanced, but the hype around these ""hashes in the sky"" is completely out of control.  This article tries to be objective, but it's not doing enough to counter the rabid zeal that is gripping silver-bullet-seeking, Twitter-wannabe young web developers.  My observations are that too many people are making the following mistakes:<p>* Overestimating their need to scale - a powerful box with a cache-backed site can serve a LOT of hits.  The vast majority of apps will never need to scale beyond this, don't kid yourself.<p>* Underestimating the amount of work and the cost of failure in maintaining data integrity at the application level - for all but the most simplistic applications you will end up writing a ton of code that replicates what a RDBMS does, except slower, with more bugs, and less generality.<p>* Underestimating the importance of data integrity - When your massive database with billions of records has subtle data integrity issues, how hard will it be to fix?  My guess is that some truly nasty situations will arise and over time the hype will be tempered by the horror stories.<p>* Underestimating the constraints this puts on future development - Sure greenfield apps may seem like a great candidate for a document-oriented DB, but how often do apps look like the original version 1 year later, 2 years later, 5 years later.  With a relational database your bets are hedged automatically.  You can go in a million different directions with your data.  The relational model gives you orders of magnitude more flexibility than complex algorithms designed for map-reduce-style scalability.  If you don't need the scalability you are throwing an awful lot of flexibility out the window for nothing.<p>*  Underestimating how relational their data really is - It's not just that developers understand the relational model, it's the fact that it's a rigorous theoretical model that actually models relationships in an academically complete way.  Sure, real life RDBMSs don't live up to the theory, and sometimes things are too slow to be practical, in which case you fudge things as necessary or add layers of caching.  But at the end of the day, the relational model can cover pretty much anything, where these hash-databases give you a small set of scalable functionality and some clever algorithms to accomplish a bunch of different things.  The things you can accomplish are not comprehensive in a theoretical sense, they are just techniques that have proven useful for a number of applications recently.  However the limitations are not as well defined as a RDBMS.",1234485705

I've seen some apps which use a slow, asynchronous RDBMS to supply denormalized 'documents' for the non-relational stores.<p>Mind you, the RDBMS could still make a comeback. The world is looking to non-relational because since 1998 or so, throwing multiple pieces of hardware and network capacity at the problem is cheaper than solving it all in one giant node or cluster. But maybe one day an off-the-shelf computer (perhaps with better concurrent programming techniques for multicore) will be able to handle all the queries you would ever want and have the bandwidth to match.<p>Also, just wondering; exactly how many organizations really need a distributed database?

RDBs are very good at modeling your data, but have scaling problems.  The cloud computing solutions scale well but are really poor at modeling data; you have to do it yourself.  Example problem: you commit an update to a record.  Subsequent reads may not see the change until the DB gets around to committing it some time later.  Can't run your airlines or banks that way.  The eventual solution will have RDB-like modeling with cloud-like scaling, replication, robustness, and all that good stuff.

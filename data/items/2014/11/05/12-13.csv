8561557,comment,8561080,8561472,0,0,VLM,,,"&quot;After a while though, it killed me inside.&quot;<p>Did they supervise you too closely?  My first job while still in school was being a network operator with maybe 5 hrs a week of real work (most of which I automated away or was just grunt labor install/cabling jobs) and maybe 5 randomly allocated hours of stark terror handling outages and disasters.  I was instructed to look busy and professional the other 30 hours per week.<p>1) I &quot;apprenticed&quot; under the PBX operator and helped out with MACs and cable pulling and learned how to terminate and test ST fiber connectors.  I had more formal telecom/EE training than the PBX op which was a little weird.  I also apprenticed under our IBM customer engineer and he had be do all kinds of crazy stuff, which was kind of cool.  The IT director got a little greedy about my &quot;volunteering&quot; for him, although if I had a better attitude about it I might have ended up working for him.<p>2) IBM manuals laying everywhere, taught myself some BAL from the books although the sysops wouldn&#x27;t give me access.  Also learned all about ATM.  IBM mainframes had this weird crypto subprocessor with great manuals.  IBM manuals, at least professional level pre 1990, were awesome, I&#x27;d suggest checking out bitsavers.org and reading some.<p>3) Taught myself motorola 68HC11 assembly, procomm/telix scripting.  I read a lot of programming books.",1415192345

8561544,comment,8557958,8560566,0,0,GardenQuality,,,"GeneralMayhem, I completely agree with you that an all black team is no more diverse than an all white team. Some might make the argument that there could be benefits to having a homogeneous team of an underrepresented group if it eliminates the plight the author went through, but I think we&#x27;d be hard pressed to find people who believe the long term solution to the issues in tech are separate racially homogeneous teams.  But either way a homogeneous black team and a homogeneous white team are still both non-diverse teams.<p>That said, reading through the article I don&#x27;t see the author ever claiming that she wants the industry to have predominantly black teams, or that predominantly black teams are the pinnacle of diversity as you suggest. In fact what I was so impressed by how little opinion or suggestion she provided throughout the entire article. For the most part, simply a listing of events that occurred through her career and the impact it had on her.<p>Regarding the specific quote mentioned in the great-grandparent comment: &quot;When I transferred to my second team there, Desktop Support, diversity lightning struck: I was a black woman reporting to another black woman in a technical role.&quot;<p>Maybe I&#x27;m misreading it, but I interpreted it as follows: The expression &quot;lightning struck&quot; generally means that a rare event occurred (I didn&#x27;t see much listing of it on google, but I&#x27;ve heard the expression many times. Maybe it&#x27;s a regional thing?). The rare event in this case was, &quot;a black woman reporting to a black woman in a technical role.&quot; And I think most people working in tech would pretty much agree this is rare (I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen it).<p>And I believe excerpting the next sentence without the two that follows it is somewhat removing the sentence from its context. Here I include all three - she writes: &quot;Moreover, our team was predominantly black. I could relate to my teammates without having to conform. I didn’t have to be anything different than who I was and I flourished there.&quot;<p>My take here is that being secure in an environment where she could relax, she didn&#x27;t have to spend significant mental cycles trying to conform to other&#x27;s expectations of her, and she could just be herself and be accepted - as a result she &quot;flourished&quot;. Whether that is just personally or also professionally isn&#x27;t explicitly stated.<p>Finally quoting another comment you made below\n>True, but mostly what I meant was that it&#x27;s funny that she refers to a room full of black people as a utopia of diversity, when it&#x27;s really just that she happens to be in the majority there.<p>As far as I could see the author never states the idea of a team of predominantly black people being a utopia or ideal of diversity. I believe this might be an incorrect interpretation of what was written.  She does say how wonderful it is to work in an environment where you are accepted for who you are (which she found on that team discussed above), not that a person needs a homogeneous team to be accepted. To support this, near the end she sates what she would like to see in an ideal case &quot;Ideally I’d like to work in a less homogeneous environment where I don’t feel so different.&quot;  Ie. less homogeneity.  However, even that, she doesn&#x27;t ask of the industry.  She doesn&#x27;t ask for there to be more black people in tech; her simple request, the final sentence of her essay is &quot;My industry needs to change to make everyone feel included and accepted.&quot;  The only change she is asking for is that Tech allow people who are different to feel accepted for who they are. An incredibly modest but valuable human request.<p>In general I try to avoid writing comments quoting other people like this because no matter how well meaning you may be, when read on the internet it often comes across as sniping. So I&#x27;ll leave things there, as I do genuinely appreciate this discussion, and hopefully this comment came across as a positive discussion as I intended.<p>My goal was just to point out that we should be cautious and ensure that in discussions we separate what the author is saying from our interpretation of their intent.  It&#x27;s a challenging task to do in any reading.",1415192149

Eloquent deductive reasoning can easily lead to wrong conclusions, which is why we need to test them with empirical results. This author in particular appears to put a prohibitively large value on physical goods over any kind of service. He dismisses the fundamental transition from an industrial economy to a service economy, simply labeling most of the new jobs as pointless. while his arguments might be convincing for a few jobs such as telemarketing, he appears to forget about the highly increased complexity of a modern economy, which requires people working in corporate law, financial services and the administrative sector. in my opinion those regulations weren&#x27;t just invented because<p><i>The ruling class has figured out that a happy and productive population with free time on their hands is a mortal danger [...]</i><p>but rather because: 1) modern technologies require a more extensive management (with an entire workforce dedicated to maintaining them). 2) because globalization creates a much more complex framework for corporations (different local laws). 3) there are much more financial options available today to both individuals and corporations. a small company from Utah can today raise money from investors in Abu Dhabi and an individual from Europe can invest in Australian mining companies - just to name a few examples. this range of services is unprecedented and requires an accordant workforce.",1415192113

And while the core of the article deals with the latter, by not making this distinction he dangerously suggests the two former.<p>As much I&#x27;d like to believe that managers are stupid, they&#x27;re not crazy to hand out free money. If an employee generated no additional income to it&#x27;s employer, there would be no reason to hire him in the first place. Similarly, if the holder of a good derived no enjoyment from it, it would be of no value at all to him.<p>It&#x27;s hard to believe, for instance, that a &quot;corporate lawyer&#x27;s&quot; work has no social value. The job of lawyers isn&#x27;t even to win legal battles, but to avoid them in the first place. The job of a corporate lawyer is to ensure corporations are compliant with all the paperwork necessary to their operation. For sufficiently large corporations, they&#x27;re a necessary condition for it&#x27;s functioning.<p>For me, the only reason why his argument might seem personally intuitive is because the majority of things in capitalism are of no use at all to any given particular person, even if all of them are &quot;useful&quot; in some way. Paparazzi, dog-washers and all-night pizza deliverymen are useless for all but the people who demand their services. It&#x27;s not hard to see why consumers would have little interest in contract law if they deal so little with it, and when they do, their job of understanding it has already been cushioned by a specialist.<p>I see little point in coffee shops. Nonetheless, people flock to places with well-developed service economies that offer such things (e.g. New York, San Francisco) along with dog-washers.

I think that there is one limit above which a CVM (e.g. PIN or signature) is required, and another limit for offline authorizations. CVM-less high-vale transactions would not only be suspicious, but even non-compliant for most card schemes.<p>- It is not trivial to apply for a merchant account, and I guess that a new account would not be allowed to immediately withdraw recently acquired funds. (If it were that simple, magnetic stripe card skimmers could simply apply for a merchant account and avoid all the hassle with PIN skimming, finding vulnerable merchants or ATMs etc.)<p>- A merchant with a higher than average rate of transactions challenged by cardholders will surely be scrutinized even more closely.<p>All in all, the implemented failure mode of offline-authorizing all transactions in unknown currencies seems like a really bad idea and should be improved.

More on that can be found further down the story.<p><a href=""http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/192305-analyzing-the-imac-5k-retina-display-how-do-you-squeeze-5k-out-of-a-last-gen-gpu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/192305-analyzing-the-imac-...</a>",1415191355

As the article noted it&#x27;s not hard to look back at previous job postings (using the article&#x27;s example).<p>So most of the time AUTO_INCREMENT is just used as an arbitrary counter / identifier which is just as guessable with other arbitrarily chosen identifiers. The linked blog uses /CCYY/MM/ URL to order the articles, then a natural string to specify a specific record, and that method could just as easily work for the record ID in the same way /AUTO_INCREMENT/NATURAL_STRING. But the question of whether you&#x27;d want to hide (or make it harder to guess) URLs for articles published to the public still remains.<p>Where AUTO_INCREMENT really causes problems is when you have information you <i>don&#x27;t</i> want public. Such as session IDs. But in those instances, it would be rare to URL-ise them in the first place (bar maybe some AJAX calls). And as far as I&#x27;m aware, nobody uses AUTO_INCREMENT for session IDs anyway (they&#x27;d have to be pretty useless developers if they did).<p>There might be some argument against AUTO_INCREMENT for some user-submitted / community services such as PasteBin and URL shorteners. But even here, if the information isn&#x27;t intended to be public then it either a) be hidden behind some level of authentication or b) shouldn&#x27;t have been published online to begin with.<p>Security aside, the other point he raised was with SEO. However even that&#x27;s not really an issue for the same reason his /CCYY/MM/ URL isn&#x27;t an issue: sites that need search engine optimised will support a human readable string as part of the URL.<p>So I don&#x27;t think his &quot;<i>Stop Putting AUTO_INCREMENT IDs in URLs</i>&quot; is really tackling the real problems and I think his example is very misleading. The real issue is people who use predictable (which includes guessable hashes) row ID&#x27;s as identifiers for non-public data <i>AND</i> the issue with developers who choose to hide non-public data behind obscurity[1] instead of secure authentication. None of which has much to do with URLs in the first place (since incrementing session ID&#x27;s are just as bad regardless of whether they&#x27;re encoded in a URL, HTTP &quot;POST&quot; body, a cookie, or whatever)<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity</a>",1415191020

So I think there another point to add here: everything manages to stick together not because of an not well explained hate for &#x27;real workers&#x27; (I can see that it exists, but how does it contribute to keep everyone in its place?).<p>On one hand it is the most stupid of all the answers: its&#x27; because of money, the salary that you get paid to do this pointless jobs.<p>And on the other hand it is because of something less clearly perceivable, yet profound and &#x27;democratized&#x27;: a part from the &#x27;real&#x27; jobs mentioned in the article - physical labor jobs, agriculture, health services - almost all the other workers are equated by the secret perception of being paid more instead of the value of their job, the value of their real work effort and contribution. But this perception alone won&#x27;t do the job. It works because it is matched by a counter-perception, almost as unmentionable: if most of the employees feel they manage to get paid more than what they do (not of what they deserve because this implies other personal, political, social, intellectual considerations), most of the employers do feel that are paying their employees less than what they contribute to the wealth of the company or organization, less of what their contribution&#x27;s value is.<p>I believe that this is at the parallel combination of these perceptions is, at least one, of the main reasons why everything keep staying the way it is, why we don&#x27;t work less.<p>What to do?<p>Organize the work differently. Start-ups have the potential to structure a division of labour, responsibilities and remuneration that provides a better sense of empowerment, equal contribution to the common aim of that the organization/company has, fair returns from the effort done. It doesn&#x27;t last long thou. As soon as the start-up become institutionalized, e.g. direct control is lost over certain operations and processes, the company/organization become bigger, certain part of the work done is captured only with quarterly reports or similar simplification, tales of the work done, the objective achieved, it tend to become as any other existing company, recreating that dual perception that I&#x27;ve mentioned before.<p>Bottom line is (probably): perception for perception, let&#x27;s ask more often and with less fear(?) to our colleagues, to the other people in general how much do they earn? what does really involve their job? It may sound a futile exercise but I believe that by communicating to each other, by spelling it out, we will play around with other possibilities, with alternative organizations and modes of labour.",1415188945

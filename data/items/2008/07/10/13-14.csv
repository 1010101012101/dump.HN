It's relevant to everyone - we all use the web, email and talk on the phone.  Between that and a big red politics flag, to me that means it shouldn't be here.  There are much better places to discuss and act on this and the numerous other serious problems with the current government.",1215698252

242376,comment,242310,242372,0,0,sant0sk1,,,"Agreed. I just perused all 27 pages and didn't see any application that just blew my mind. A bit disappointing, but like you said there is a lot of room in this space for a hacker with an innovative mind.<p>Funny, my company had a test iPhone with the 2.0 software on it (to test the Exchange connector) and we gave it back yesterday. The whole time I had it I could click on the ""App Store"" button but couldn't connect. If we would have kept it one more day I could be one of the first to try these apps out.",1215698028

242370,comment,242277,242277,0,0,inovica,,,"Maybe it is anti-web, but its leveraging the internet in what it does.  We have created some hybrid apps that work really well - we have the power of the desktop (for what we do) and the connectivity of the internet (not web) for delivering a better service.  I don't like how iTunes works, but I do like what they have been good at which is pioneering the service they have. I also use it for renting movies, which is a great service. At the end of the day Apple is a business - most of us are on here because we're looking at, interested in or running startup businesses and if we had a great idea that took off similar to iTunes I'm sure we wouldn't be so negative towards our own invention.",1215697073

Now, this may be a compromise between their lawyers and the host of innovative search offerings they can't put in a legal box at the moment, but I'm still hesitant to think this is all great.<p>Looking through the TOS I also found this beauty (good luck writing a blog post announcing that you are now integrating BOSS search results):<p>(a) You shall not refer to the Services, or use or display any Yahoo! trademarks, service marks, logos or other Yahoo!-related branding in connection with any Links or Web Search Results or in any other manner, except where expressly and specifically authorized by Yahoo! in writing.",1215696781

3097505,comment,3094535,3096457,2,0,tomkarlo,,,"Increasing density and preventing further sprawl drives up real estate values in general and greatly benefits the existing homeowner. If you can take a plot allocated to a single-family dwelling, and put ten apartments on it, it's worth more yet rents for less.<p>In my view, the forces behind not allowing more vertical building are really developers who want more sprawl, because they want to buy up unused land at the fringes of a city and build houses on it rather than have to assemble blocks from existing neighborhoods.<p>The unfortunate answer in all this is that the best way to reduce commuting is to make it harder to commute. Don't build more roads to subsidize long commutes, make work parking more expensive, and favor public transport in allocation of lanes and space. Europe is already doing this, and some cities in the US (like San Francisco) are also doing it to some degree.<p>I suspect, however, that we won't really get serious about it here in the US until gas hits about $15 a gallon.",1318316300

No.<p>The problem here, and what is making us chuckle so much, is that the project as presented to us is not magical.

Some of us were, with cynical apprehension. Did this release of the project live up to that expectation? Nope. Could others have done a better job? Maybe, maybe not. Could this project improve over time? Certainly. Will Dart become a JavaScript killer without more magic in its cross-compiler? Personally, I doubt it.

Using the top of the main view for a status update button or textarea is common throughout facebook and has been for years.  I don't think Facebook is ""copying"" MyPad for using left-hand navigation and its positioning of the status button or other elements.<p>In fact, MyPad, being designed specifically for Facebook, obviously drew from Facebook's features and one would expect them to mimic Facebook's UI to ensure a seamless user experience; and MyPad perhaps did the best job in Facebook's long absence.<p>To claim that Facebook somehow acted unprofessionally by ""copying"" MyPad-- an application who's inspiration was drawn from Facebook in the first place-- is a complete fallacy.<p>I think the Facebook IA developers and UI designers deserve more credit.

You'd have to be crazy to suggest otherwise. Think of it, ""Enforceable rule"". Not just something in this circumstance, but a rule, and enforceable. That's exactly what oversight is for.<p>But I was talking about safeguards. Any rule is worthless without knowing when to stop applying it. Who's watching for it to go wrong? Nobody of course because it doesn't really exist.<p>>> Oh, of course he has no rights - they informed him of it. Well then, who could argue?\n> He was informed of the requirement, and of an alternate process which would not require him to present ID. The comment I was responding to apparently meant to imply that this was a law of which the public was unaware, and that violators would only be informed of what they had done after the fact.<p>It is a requirement the public is (mostly) unaware of. And because it's unspoken policy instead of a law it'll likely stay that way.<p>> And while I dislike the TSA and ""post-9/11"" ""security"" measures as much as the next person, I don't believe that enforcing a simple security measure equates to total loss of rights. But then...<p>It's not a security measure because it doesn't help security at all. Enforcing useless rules is a loss of your rights.<p>>> Almost total corruption being used to enforce secret laws. Check.\n> Wild hyperbole. Check.<p>Not at all. Using undisclosed governmental powers to secretly kill someone's business because they won't enact useless and counterproductive policies is a textbook example of systemic corruption.<p>>> How does age-related restrictions on alcohol relate to ID requirements for flying?\n> I cannot purchase alcohol without presenting ID. I cannot fly without either presenting ID or going through a screening process.<p>Yes, that much is a given. Thanks.<p>But one is because minors have shown to have (even more) problems with booze and it's been proven to kill, etc. On the other hand showing ID is absolutely worthless for finding weapons, in practice and in theory.<p>> Interestingly, both involve reasoning based on public safety, and in neither case is there a law passed by Congress which directly enacts the requirement.<p>But in the case of alcohol there is a law. We aren't a society of just-take-the-hint and why-won't-you-read-between-the-lines, we're a society of laws.<p>Why are you so dead set on spinning this as business as usual? Who cares?

If I'm a developer working on a new project, and I'm dissatisfied with JavaScript, I have a couple of options. I could try Dart, which will cost me a significant amount of performance in all browsers that aren't Chrome, or I could go with CoffeeScript, which will have good performance in all browsers (including Chrome, since Chrome will be forced by the other browser manufacturers to keep its engine up-to-date). For me that'd be an easy choice, unless one of three things happens:<p>(1) Dart's performance is <i>so much</i> better than that of JavaScript that it's worth sacrificing performance in every other browser to get hugely better performance in Chrome. That seems unlikely to me, but maybe it's possible.<p>(2) Chrome ends up with 90%+ market share, so it doesn't matter that I'm bad in all the other browsers. But I can't see this happening as long as e.g. iOS is around and relevant.<p>(3) I have the resources to write both a Dart version for Chrome and a CoffeeScript version for older browsers.

Look at this thread. A lot of people were expecting something looking closer to Go. Go itself is an example: statically typed, garbage collected ""systems"" language. If you ignore the differences in the type system and the slice syntactic sugar, that sounds conspicuously close to Java. And Dart itself sounds closer to Java than Javascript as well. Not that I believe we'll converge on Java, given the glacial pace of evolution in that community.<p>But the edges of the state-of-the-art are getting closer in this generation. Next generation (5-10 years from now) will be even closer, if not identical.<p>On a technical note: what exactly do you have in mind when making a distinction between ""web"" and ""systems""? Backends qualify as ""systems"" in my book and I'd be a fool if I'd want to develop in two distinct languages when there is just one app. Thanks to GWT and now Dart, I don't have to.",1318314326

3097366,comment,3097105,3097341,7,0,tolmasky,,,"1. Not necessarily, as shown here, Google has a separate optimization step. If you look at the other posts you will see that using other google products, such as closure compiler/etc will make this all significantly smaller. This <i>makes sense</i>. Have the guys who know how to make JS small work on that problem, thus benefiting BOTH hand rolled JS code and Dart-compiled JS code. If not you are eternally having to do merges of the product, the possibility of being on a stale copy, etc.<p>2. The reason for spitting out ""inefficient"" code is already described in my post. This is inefficient for Hello, World. That's fine, it may be the proper tradeoff for <i>efficiency</i> in more complex code. Take CocoaTouch for example. If you write a HelloWorld app for iOS and profile it, you could say ""why on earth is this app reading in preferences, sending out didLaunch delegate messages, etc etc etc. Doesn't the code KNOW I don't need that and all I want is to show one string"". This is an acceptable tradeoff, because all those things its doing are useful for more complex apps. No one is shipping HelloWorld, so who cares if its slower than the <i>best possible</i> HelloWorld? Is it possible to write a compiler <i>so smart</i> that it would even make HelloWorld super small and fast. Sure, maybe, but those engineering resources are much better spent working on problems real applications face. I'd much prefer Apple focus on scrolling performance than HelloWorld. And similarly, I much prefer Google focus on the problem of writing huge web apps that still perform really well, since thats the remaining unsolved problem for the web.",1318313476

It's like a cancer, and if you look closely, the people who benefited the most are the ones who created the mess. Not, what I'd call, biggest victims who lost their jobs because of the mess and ended up not affording what they could afford before. I'm not sure the mess was cleaned up either, I think it was whitewashed.<p>On the issue of where taxes go, instead of the rich refusing to be taxed to fund wars and give bailouts, why not insist on policy change and frugality to ensure that taxes are utilized properly and efficiently. Much as it will never be perfect, it can be close to perfect if with the same vigor that people fight taxes, they would fight for better utilization of the taxes.",1318313222

I was able to get it to reload content without realizing it changed (by editing the note, then closing it in Quiver before it detected the change and reopening) and this didn&#x27;t throw away the undo history, which seems like just a fairly simple bug.<p>Or to put it more generally, Undo works in Quiver pretty much the same way you&#x27;d expect it to work in any editor that can reload files that change on disk; the undo history simply doesn&#x27;t concern itself with undoing changes made outside of the app, and in most cases reloading the file from disk throws away undo history.",1454460916

My (inter)personal experiences identify a few distinct culprits, perhaps amongst many, or perhaps all a naive fiction i&#x27;ve constructed for myself:<p>1. Overstimulation, an inability to cope with all the new perceptions. This is especially pertinent during come-up. If you experience overstimulation in sober life, you&#x27;ll probably recognize it. If you haven&#x27;t, it feels like agitation and confusion.<p>2. Anxiety that is brought into the trip that is either consciously perceived or not beforehand. If something&#x27;s bothering you at the back of your mind, it&#x27;s going to come up front and center.<p>3. Intrusive thoughts. There&#x27;s no reason why they can&#x27;t happen on a trip, right? Like sober life, the best thing that makes them go away is acknowledging them and letting them play out. Trying to force them down can make them worse. Intrusive thoughts can lead to disturbing experiences even if they don&#x27;t result in a bad trip.<p>4. Panic from feeling your own body in unfamiliar ways. Your proprioception shifts rapidly with LSD. You might not be able to tell where your limbs are, or whether they even still exist. The solidity of your body suddenly feels a little too insubstantial. You can&#x27;t tell if you&#x27;re too hot or too cold. Blankets don&#x27;t seem to work. Come-up can be rough like this. You need to have immense trust in the world that you&#x27;re ok, that you&#x27;re not falling apart, that your body can take care of itself and your brain will soon compensate for the new chemical situation and restore homeostasis and understand your modified internal senses.<p>5. Temporary psychosis. it happens and i am not qualified to suggest a remedy or reasoning to it.<p>Edit: Sleep! Sleep deprivation is definitely on this list. Can&#x27;t sleep on acid.",1454460369

Do you currently use Flipboard? Current? Any of the other darling news apps that won marketshare because of the smart and sharp design ethos? I&#x27;m taking a liberty here in saying that you most likely don&#x27;t.<p>Apps and websites and gleam are <i>ephemeral</i>. They are very important to people (and especially tech-world people like ourselves), but they are still ephemeral and our tastes are fickle.<p>What NYT is doing here is providing the continuity of news it has reported as a means of shoring up its <i>reliability as a source</i> and its <i>reputation as a journalism organization</i>.<p>When people search for news, or read something on a blog and search for stronger evidence, where do they go? Do they go to the app/website/organization with the best website or the best app? Sometimes, maybe; but more often no, they choose the organization with the best reputation for truth (even if leaning in one direction). You can disagree with the politics of the NYT, but I don&#x27;t think people tend to dispute much outside of the Opinions/Editorials (and if they do, it&#x27;s generally something other reputable sources would be disputed on).<p>The website experience of the NYT is great, in my opinion. The long-form, js-augmented pieces are incredible. Are you so unhappy with them that their expansion of available archives is such a diversion from what you think their goals should be?<p>News is about events in context, and context includes the history. If you are lambasting them over their opening up of a trove of <i>near recent</i> archives, then you have a blinded view of the world. &quot;[T]he province of history books - but not of successful businesses&quot; -- could there be a better symbol of the lack of contextual understanding than the utter dismissal of news from the last 30 years? Can we not look back at history to make determinations as to causes of current news? Is ISIS a being conceived and borne entirely out of thin air from the present on? Is the news of 10 years ago so worthless that we shouldn&#x27;t have easy access to see what happened or was talked about in the days when the Iraq War was first debated or when the first Persian Gulf War happened?<p>The <i>newspaper industry</i> is failing, but the Times is still profitable. Now is not the time for them to sell stock of what makes them -- as you say -- the world&#x27;s leading institution of journalism. Archives are important, and it is sincerely disheartening for the top comment about this new source lambasting them for not focusing on bettering an app.",1454458451

I agreed to by paid far less than normal.<p>I wore a number of hats as you do in startup land, especially in the early days. I was a Project Manager, Tech Lead, Designer & Developer. Not to be arrogant here, but somebody with this skill set was absolutely crucial to get us to where we are today. Solid deliverables were delivered and the founders were always so pleased and excited to have me on the team.<p>Before I came on board, they were trying to outsource their technology to india. Sending bad looking designs and technical specs written by a non-techy. The final result was always so average. A company specialising in delivering tech, couldn&#x27;t deliver tech.<p>When I started, we continued with the outsourcing for sometime but with my oversight and redesign of the platforms.. After some time, it simply was not working. I had the connections to bring on a new developer so we could start building things in-house, with proper development cycles, oversight & accountability. So we did that. Over the course of the year the team grew. We&#x27;re now at 6.<p>Once this happened, we started landing some pretty cool projects thanks to the teams work. The capability and the quality of work we were putting forward and the character of us all helped significantly with getting these projects on board.\nA year has passed and I have poured my heart and soul in to the company.

Private/company projects are run in Gitlab instances, though I may switch to Gitweb if a minor cosmetic issue is resolved (Gitweb in Sandstorm can only host one repo by design but you still have to click through to it when viewing the instance, which is mildly annoying when all other apps come up ready to use.) I have a bunch of Wekan boards managing everything from coding projects to my GTD buckets to separate boards for random home improvement projects. I prefer Wekan to spreadsheets because I can track work through arbitrary workflows and annotate items with additional data, and Sandstorm lets me manage that without having to maintain and secure a separate Wekan server that any random person could find and exploit. My blog is hosted in Sandstorm WordPress so I have the niceness of its admin interface but none of its security risks, and all the speed of a static site. A small 2-person bootstrapped startup I&#x27;ve cofounded uses it for many of the same use cases plus hosting our app&#x27;s Piwik instance, again so there&#x27;s literally no non-Sandstorm-secured user-facing attack surface other than Piwik&#x27;s API endpoint.

Unless you&#x27;re really rich, it&#x27;s tough to do much serious science in your spare time on weekends, paying for equipment from your own pocket. So the idea is that a scientist gets a <i>job</i> that pays him/her to do science. The system rewards scientists who advance knowledge and penalizes those who do not.<p>How do we determine whom to reward? It is extremely difficult to evaluate most scientists&#x27; work unless you are an expert in the same field.

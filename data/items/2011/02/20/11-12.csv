2241681,comment,2239323,2239323,0,0,Mz,,,"Age 13 or 14 used to be a common age for performing ""coming of age"" (ie entrance to official adulthood) ceremonies.  And girls were often married off at age 14 to 16, sometimes to much older men. Americans today generally find that practice appalling as well. The article does mention this earlier change, in somewhat different terms:<p><i>Pre-adulthood can be compared to adolescence, an idea invented in the mid-20th century as American teenagers were herded away from the fields and the workplace and into that new institution, the high school. For a long time, the poor and recent immigrants were not part of adolescent life; they went straight to work, since their families couldn't afford the lost labor and income. But the country had grown rich enough to carve out space and time to create a more highly educated citizenry and work force. Teenagers quickly became a marketing and cultural phenomenon. They also earned their own psychological profile. One of the most influential of the psychologists of adolescence was Erik Erikson, who described the stage as a ""moratorium,"" a limbo between childhood and adulthood characterized by role confusion, emotional turmoil and identity conflict.</i><p>I have two sons, ages 21 and 23.  They spend their days playing video games, getting the groceries and doing what household chores need to get done while I go off to a paid job.  All three of us have plans to eventually make money online.  All three of us remain frustrated (so far) with such goals.  The primary reason for our on-going failure in that regard:  I and my oldest son have a serious medical condition and most of our efforts go towards getting all there of us healthy after a lifetime of illness and relatively late diagnoses.  So my family is part of this ""phenomenon"", and we are vastly better off for it than if they got jobs, got married, and all that other ""adult"" stuff.  I think they are behaving far more responsibly and are far more independent-minded (in a healthy way) than most so-called adults of any age.<p>Given that our medical condition is one of the most expensive, chronic, incurable medical conditions you can have and that most of the medical expenses people like us typically incur are covered by insurance, state aid, federal aid, charities and write-offs (when people just can't pay and the hospital takes a loss), I think getting ourselves well is also the socially responsible thing to do, not mere self-indulgence.  I remain frustrated that it gets so little attention (of the good sort -- I've gotten plenty of negative attention in online forums) and the diet and lifestyle approach to wellness is not more popular.  I estimate there is about a billion dollars a year spent on the 30,000 or so people with CF in the US alone -- again, mostly being paid by other people in some fashion or another (ie <i>your</i> taxes help pay for this) -- and there is a recession on.  It boggles my mind that no one seems to want to support this, promote this, etc.<p>Anyway, <i>if</i> (and that's a very big if) I ever get anywhere in terms of helping others with my condition get well, it will be due in very large part to my ""lazy, good-for-nothing, unemployed bums of eternally adolescent sons who refuse to get real jobs"". Even if I can't help anyone else, I cannot get well without the support of my unemployed sons.  No, I don't want them getting jobs, thank you.",1298202087

I had to make a free operating system, that was clear — the only way that people could work together and share was with a free operating system.</i><p><i>At first, I thought of making a Lisp-based system, but I realized that wouldn't be a good idea technically. To have something like the Lisp machine system, you needed special purpose microcode. That's what made it possible to run programs as fast as other computers would run their programs and still get the benefit of typechecking. Without that, you would be reduced to something like the Lisp compilers for other machines. The programs would be faster, but unstable. Now that's okay if you're running one program on a timesharing system — if one program crashes, that's not a disaster, that's something your program occasionally does.

You need to adapt your testing strategy accordingly.<p>One useful strategy is to define a decent metric, and try to maximize it. Let's say that you have two sources of data: (1) A list of pages that should rank highly for specific queries, and (2) a list of links that users clicked on <i>and stayed at</i> without coming back to click on other links < 30 seconds later.<p>Your goal is to write a search engine which ranks these links, on average, as highly as possible for the relevant queries. You do this with the usual techniques of experimental science: Split your data in half, develop against part of it, and hold a part in reserve for your final tests.<p>If you make a clever change, and your average ""good link"" position drops from 1.7 to 3.9, you back your change out and try again.<p>One of my clients actually did something similar with mapping software. Before deploying new code (or a new version of the map data), they ran extensive automated tests, and flagged anything weird for human review. I wrote them several test harnesses, one of which discovered a situation where the driving directions took a right hand turn off an overpass and tried to merge into traffic below... :-)<p>Granted, these types of ""tests"" are essentially very high-level integration tests.

My parents immigrated in 1992 with 2 small kids, little to no English and no money. Fast forward to today- they own a business, 3 homes, have put both kids through undergrad (I've gone on to complete a masters) and have achieved a fairly comfortable upper middle class lifestyle.<p>Why am I telling you this?  As long as ""the little guy"" believes that if you're intelligent and willing to work hard, you can achieve great things in America (in many places around the world this is not always the case), this country has a future.

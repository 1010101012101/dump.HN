I'm not sure if you're interested in the details here (after all, it sounds like you might have spent longer on the HN comment than on the ""30 seconds"" with SmartOS), but if you provision the default base smartos64 image (currently version 1.6.3), ""top"" is available via pkgsrc (""pkgin in top"").  Not only that, but due to popular demand, we've also ported ""htop"" to SmartOS (""pkgin in htop"").  In terms of node.js version, I think what you're referring to is the node found in the base platform (/usr/bin/node), not the node available via pkgsrc (which will appear as /opt/local/bin/node).  This is definitely a point of confusion, and we've rectified it in the next version of our software by not having the node version that we use in the base platform be visible to SmartMachines (that is, there isn't a /usr/bin/node).<p>More generally, we're definitely committed to making SmartOS the best environment for the modern cloud; I'm sorry that your experience was frustrating, and if you have any additional concrete feedback on what you'd like to see improved, we're all ears.

When they are on, I can listen to music with great fidelity. I mostly listen to classical and rock.<p>Most importantly, they are extremely comfortable.  I bought them when I was flying cross-country every week, and I wanted to have something that wouldn't hurt my ears after a few hours.",1353312960

4803434,comment,4802732,4802732,2,0,jacques_chester,,,"The phenomenon of having products in a lineup which are never meant to sell is well known to marketers.<p>The exact name for it escapes me just now.<p>Basically, the logic goes:<p>1. Find a feature that is easily differentiable and cheap to create.<p>2. Differentiate on that feature for a relatively small markup. It'll be almost pure profit.<p>In software this is easy as a few named constants in your source code or some entries in a database table.<p>So for example, last time I looked The Economist had three subscription types:<p>Paper, Digital, Paper & Digital.<p>They priced the Paper and the Paper & Digital plans <i>identically</i>. Why?<p>Because the contrast between P/P&D made P&D more attractive. It increases sales of the P&D plan and, overall, improves the total profit on the deal.<p>There are many other businesses where ""sacrificial lambs"" are created to sell the outlying plans. As usual I refer folks to <i>The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing</i> for details.",1353312923

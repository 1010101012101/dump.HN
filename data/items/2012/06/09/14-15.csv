4088211,comment,4087631,4087829,1,0,andreasvc,,,"The current machine translation systems work with parallel texts, and they will for the foreseeable future. However, to properly translate you need to understand the meaning of a text, not just look up words or phrases in a table as is currently done (and using statistics does not address this). In other words, you need to have a connection between language and world, which is something only an intelligent agent has, hence the problem is AI complete. In terms of the nuances that were cited, it's not so much that they are infinite which is the problem, as other potentially infinite combinatorial systems such as syntax can be analysed effectively by computers. Rather it is the fact that choosing the right nuance depends on a completely arbitrary amount of context, such as the whole history of Russia when you're translating a Russian novel. So the problem is not impossible, but considering that even humans need years and years of study to do a good job at translation, I'd say machine translation that replaces humans is quite infeasible.",1339253586

4088176,story,,,1,0,stephenmarshall,"Start A Business",http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/stephen-marshall/36/90/461,"Have you ever been in your job and thought there has to be more to life than this? Have you had times when you wondered what it would be like to start a business or thought are there people out there who could teach me how to run a business, allowing you to be your own boss, to make the decisions and not be told what to do all the time. Have you felt frustrated at being passed up for a promotion?\nI am sure most people have had thoughts of this throughout there working lives. Well let me tell you that it is possible to be your own boss, to start a business and become successful with it. Obviously knowing the steps to take and in what sequence is a key element in starting any entrepreneur venture, but it isn't as difficult and scary as you would think.\nThere are some basic steps that you can do that will genuinely get you on the right foot and get you moving forward and in the right direction.\nThe first step to take is to attract traffic to you. What I mean by traffic is: People. Any business no matter how big or small, new or old is totally dependent on people. Getting people to know who you are, where you are, what it is you do, what you can do for them is the first thing that any business needs to concentrate on. This isn't as difficult as you might imagine, providing you know the right ways to do this. Maximum impact for minimum effort comes to mind.\nThe second step for anyone to take in starting their own business is to capture leads, or to put it another way, get people to give you their information. This usually is in the form of names, e-mail addresses and phone numbers. The question you have to ask is what can you do for people, that would make them happily give you their details? Again this may seem a daunting task but let me reassure you that it is far easier than you may think.\nThirdly you need to build the relationship with people. Like you would if you planted a new flower in the ground. You have to nurture it to grow and blossom, so you must do the same with people. Building those relationships is a key element that allows you to build trust, helps you understand what people want and need and allows people to see what you can do for them.\nThe fourth step you take is to start asking for the sale. As you progress and take all the steps and carry them out in the correct order then not forgetting to ask for the cash is the next step. So many people take all the steps, do all that is needed then never ask for the money.\nThe next phase in the series is to deliver what you say. Always remember the old saying of the customers come first. Any business is all about what you can do for people, so make sure that what you say and promise to deliver and bring satisfaction to your customers.\nThe penultimate step to help you start your successful business is to up sell to your customers. Have you ever been to Mcdonalds or Starbucks and had the staff if you want something else with your order? This is up selling. If someone buys something from you that they like, want or need and they get fantastic satisfaction from you, then do you think they will want do more business with you?\nThe seventh step you will take is to get referrals from people. Word of mouth is without doubt the best form of advertising you can ever possibly get. Think what you do when a friend recommends something or someone to you, do you check them out? I bet you do. So when you fulfil a need for someone or bring satisfaction to them, ask them for an endorsement.\nBy following these very simple and basic rules you are giving yourself the very best start to your new life as a newbusiness owner / entrepreneur.",1339252879

Obviously I only tested what was listed below so take that with a grain of salt but I researched and went over others not mentioned.<p>THE TOOLS:<p>iPad 3, Adonit Jot Flip Stylus<p>THE APPS:<p>Noteshelf, Ghostwriter Notes, Paper (by Fifty Three), Note+<p>THE BREAKDOWN:<p>After spending weeks researching, reading, watching youtube videos, etc... I narrowed down my decision on the best note taking apps to Ghostwriter Notes and Noteshelf of over a dozen other apps. Since Paper and Note+ were both free, I downloaded them to try them out as well. Here are the results...<p>Note+ - Total garbage. Not even worth rating as this app would receive negative points if I could issue such a thing.<p>Paper - Probably great for other purposes but totally not designed for note taking in mind and thus would be rated incredibly low.<p>Ghostwriter Notes (paid app) - Sounded sooooo good in theory and in videos but in practice, there were so many things wrong with this app. Regular note taking was completely unresponsive unless you plan on writing in font size 80. The only way around this problem was to use the zoom in writing feature but that left very little writing space at a time and the text in the box were often pixelated and there is still some lag time. The writing guard sucks as it required constant adjustment, etc. In essence, don't bother.<p>Noteshelf (paid app) - This was THE best option I found. The flaws were few. And while it lacked some options (such as PDF annotation), those are unimportant in just plain note taking if that's what you're primarily interested in. It does the job incredibly well (albeit not 5 stars). This app does a good enough job that I'm sticking with it.<p>FINAL NOTES:<p>I own almost everything Apple so iPad has always been my tablet of choice (I've owned all 3 versions). Yours may differ. In terms of picking stylus, I spent a couple weeks researching this as well and going over more than half a dozen kickstarter projects (new and old) as well. Jot Flip ended up being the one I liked best. For awhile, I was debating between that and the Cregle iPen until I saw a review video on YouTube showcasing the iPen (apparently the response isn't base on the tip but a sensor on the side). I then decided Jot Flip was the way to go. I wanted a stylus that resembled a pen tip and note one of those thick rubber heads you often see which I'd imagine blows for actual writing.<p>As a side note, if you just want a stylus without the pen, you can buy just the Jot or Jot Pro. The difference is the Jot Flip includes an actual pen on the opposite head. I wanted to keep the pen option available and was totally not disappointed. Its a really nice pen.",1339251047

That strategy has been shown to have low entropy. Multiword passwords <i>are</i> easier to remember, but you need something actually random. If you want a strong multiword password, it's a good idea to have an actual RNG do it for you, so you can use something like <a href=""http://passphra.se/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://passphra.se/</a>. If they don't already, hackers will soon have dictionaries that will crack passwords like ""ring around the rosy"" and ""there is no spoon"" as easily as ""champagne"", but they're never going to crack a password like ""eager man dirt fly"" in better than brute force time.<p>OK, so with that out of the way, let's say you've chosen a weak (and common) password. If people start using this self-salting scheme, it's a fair bet someone else that will use the same self-salt as you, and that means two identical hashes in the database. That's bad news.<p>But it's also easy to fix. Simply choose some fixed salt to also add to your password. It could be the first two letters of your username, for example. That way, if ""bobmarley"" and ""jackblack"" both have the password ""champagne"" and both used the first four letters of the website for their salt, then on linked in one will be ""linkbochampagne"" and the other will be ""linkjachampagne"", and they can rest knowing that it's <i>very</i> unlikely that their password will hash the same as someone else's.",1339250492

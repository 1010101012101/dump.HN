Everything else is an implementation detail.<p>Your addressbook does not automatically hook up with trusted friends to update because you just glossed over about five or six Certifiably Hard Problems such as a) proving identity, b) disambiguating names, c) trust, and d) doing it all with a GUI which will not cause a big-thinker-no-technical-skills-marketing-consultant to say ""Why do the freaking engineers make it so I need a PhD in graph theory to use my freaking address book?

An important part was that he thought about his decisions, and when he decided the answer was no, that's what he delivered.  He didn't always say no, but when it was appropriate, he made sure he did say it.<p>The last section tied it up well, however. You have to know when to stop.  You have to apply intelligence.<p>It requires thought, as well as discipline and persistence.",1252841924

820032,comment,819533,819533,0,0,rooshdi,,,"We as human beings have an almost innate ability to overlook the tediousness of certain tasks if we enjoy the overall process of accomplishing them. Personally, I find that I love working on distinctive projects that not only help myself become more productive, but also help my fellow earthlings accomplish tasks much more dexterously. This ""love"" is what fuels the fire of innovation and consequently cremates the long ladder of steps we as humans occasionally become overly aware of.",1252841622
820030,comment,819942,819942,0,0,easyfrag,,,"Organizations will always come up with ways to encourage buying more (or paying a higher price), but the strategies are a moving target because a given market will learn and adjust (albeit slowly).  I would argue that the MRSP ""trick"" no longer works because almost no one expects to pay it anymore.<p>Using some of these tactics could backfire depending on how educated or savvy your target market is. Think of spam messages, those over the top tactics used to work on more people, now for most educated people that type of hard sell doesn't work.<p>Of course it all depends on the target market, if you're selling blankets with arms the bar is a little lower.",1252841283

Even though we already have premises and 1 staff member, and a product virtually finished, I think we'd get miles more value for our 5-6% from YC.<p>There seems to be this notion in the UK that raising money and starting a business is a reality TV show.

While this sort of attitude is floating around, I'm just not sure how to approach the whole funding problem in the UK.<p>We haven't approached any investors here yet (although we have been approached), and I am feeling like I'm going to have to look to the other side of the Atlantic to find the kind of people that I'd like to work with.",1252841261

Choose too soon -- you don't have a relevant criterion.

And my whole point is that your title is false: size doesn't really matter for a framework, at least at the size differences you're talking about.

820016,comment,819865,819865,0,0,amix,,,"Following this guide blindly is a bad idea. Doing premature caching can be dangerous - you may end up caching stuff that gets hit once, you may miss caching stuff that get hit a lot of times and you may end up making your caching a lot more complex than it needs to be.<p>A better caching strategy is to collect data (for example, what are the most used queries) and then do caching optimization based upon this data. I.e. don't apply caching blindly, but apply it by profiling your application. This approach also works for testing out how new caching strategies affect your cache and your database.",1252839693

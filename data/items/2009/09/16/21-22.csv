826916,comment,826151,826305,0,0,jchonphoenix,,,"So reCaptcha uses a statistical accuracy and machine learning algorithms to compare the user input for the same word over hundreds of users. Thus by doing this they minimize the probability that a human who incorrectly deciphers a word skews their data.<p>Also reCaptcha's present two words. One of which is known, and used as a normal captcha, the other of which is an unreadable word. Thus if a someone passes the captcha word, its somewhat assumed that he also correctly typed in the unknown word because the words are presented in randomized order.<p>Finally, as a funny anecdote, Luis told me once of this time that they noticed there was a captcha farm in latin America paying pennies for poor latin american's to solve reCaptcha's for them in order to gain the ability to generate illegal spam. Luis started sending them whole sentences of reCaptcha's and eventually made it to full paragraph's. Ironically, the reCaptcha farm continued to solve these captcha's. He eventually stopped their activity, but he said the data they generated was some of the best he's ever gotten... :P",1253138372
826915,story,,,8,5,qeorge,"Ask HN: Does storing CC data in the session violate PCI compliance?",,"In our app we wish to show an order confirmation screen between taking the customer's credit card data and processing the transaction. To achieve this, the app would need to store the customer's credit card information in the session while we present the interstitial confirmation screen. This would be the only time card data is ever stored by the app.<p>My question is whether this ""counts"" as storing card data, in regards to PCI compliance. My instinct is that it would, but I have seen similar payment flows on big-name retailers' websites. As storing CVV2 information is never allowed regardless of the level of PCI compliance, I don't know how they can do this while remaining compliant.<p>So my question is threefold:<p>1) In regards to PCI compliance, is there a distinction between short term and long term storage?<p>2) Is there another way to temporarily store sensitive data which is preferable to the session and adheres to the PCI guidelines?<p>3) Does this require PCI Level 1 compliance?<p>I've put a fair amount of time into Googling this and haven't found a clear answer. As so many of us on HN sell products of some kind online, surely someone here has dealt with this issue before.<p>Thanks for any advice you can provide.

I'm also not saying 'Ruby is slower so we should all use Lisp', I'm saying: Ruby is much less capable than Lisp, so it neither is a Lisp nor is it able to replace Lisp for the tasks where people use Lisp. For an expert Lisp programmer there is little reason to use Ruby anyway. Ruby has a larger user community, but that does not help me when Ruby simply does not provide the capabilities I need - the user community could be ten times larger and the number of libraries could be also even larger. It does not help if the libraries that I'm interested in are not available and probably never will.<p>Matz designed Ruby for so-called 'ordinary' people with him to do the language design. I can tell you for sure that I neither like his design nor do I want him as the language designer. In the Lisp world the implementors role is to empower the user, not make them dependent. I need a new control structure? I write one myself. I don't have to wait for some benevolent dictator, who probably does not get basic designs right - just look at the confusion of blocks, lambdas, etc. in Ruby.<p>(also there is no excuse for putting confused stuff on slides, even when he is not a native speaker - lots of people (including me) are no native English speakers and I haven't sensed this amount of confusion Matz shows)<p>That Lisp is too complicated for some people is not news, still Emacs (which he tried) now comes with a standard library of a million lines of Emacs Lisp code for all kinds of editor extensions. Emacs Lisp code that has been written by very different people and obviously a lot of them learned enough Lisp to write sophisticated applications based on Emacs (like GNUS, calc, the various mail modes, org mode, ...).<p>Lisp is also not only great technically and theoretically, but some people found it practically. There weren't ten maintained Common Lisp implementations if there were no users for it. For example the talks at the Lisp Meeting last sunday here in Hamburg described several applications in Lisp: an airline reservation system (developed by a team of hundred people, fifty of them Lisp programmers), a visual reactive programming system, an aircraft analysis tool, a reasoner for the semantic web, a visual simulation system, machine learning applications and some more.",1253136631

There is a lot of guarding-our-flanks with that crowd.  It's totally normal and expected, however some people have more of a reputation for it than others, which can lead to some players being unable to make any pacts without excessive bribery.<p>On the other hand, my current social peers are paragons of morality.  If someone says something regarding the game, no matter how casually, they will be bound do that for a reasonable duration.  Breaking this code creates a reputation which will carry over for the next few games and you'll find very few people willing to ally with you without stringent conditions.<p>Another odd example is playing multiplayer Magic: the Gathering.  Throughout our time there have been a few decks that may not win often or quickly, but when they get going they become unstoppable, kill everyone in a single turn, or create a global effect that makes the game ""unfun"" for the other players such as destroying all their creatures and lands.  Some of them have gotten such a reputation that certain players have only to play a certain spell on their first turn and the rest of the table will immediately focus on killing that one person first.",1253135748

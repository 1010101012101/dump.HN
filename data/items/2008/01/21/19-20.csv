Probably the biggest challenge would be getting blogs to output threaded feeds.<p>A standard protocol for posting comments on blogs sounds like it would be politically difficult due to fear of comment spam (it doesn't matter whether that fear is justified). Technically I think you could use unathenticated AtomPub, but I don't know if anyone has implemented this use case.<p>As for NNTP, you can't serve it from a $7 Dreamhost account so obviously it sucks.",1200945519

I'm planning to do a startup this summer and am saving to get the starting capital. I'm always worrying about not having good enough skills, not knowing enough, etc. So to force myself to start, I made a big deal out of it to tell everyone that I'm going to start this summer, and if I won't start, I'm going to donate the money - about E8000 = $12000 - to the Storm Front or something. Everybody says I'm crazy and if I don't start I should donate the money to a good cause, but the extreme social embarrassment associated with the original setup virtually guarantees I will start this summer :-)",1200945364

101740,comment,101506,101723,0,0,curi,,,"Before intelligence, there was no such thing as 'sexual attraction' in the current sense. There was only the exact same thing animals have: programs that behave in certain ways, based on certain inputs. Like a DARPA car steers left on certain input, an animal has sex on certain input.<p>With the advent of intelligence, came the ability for high-level interpretation of sense input -- we might say that events took on meaning. From a survival point of view, the ability to reinterpret arousal chemicals, and other things, was no serious danger: any culture that did that would die out. (And even if it was dangerous for the species, evolution doesn't do advanced planning of that sort.)<p>What we have today, and call sexual attraction, involves many layers of intelligent interpretation, which we (largely unintentionally) teach to the next generation -- ie, it is culture. If parents behaved differently, the meaning of sexual attraction would change.<p>Edit: By analogy, DNA = assembly language. We program in higher level languages. (Imagine programming in 500 years though, so it's much further removed from assembly). At some level of abstraction, the original details of DNA/assembly are totally irrelevant to the level we normally think in.",1200943043

If you are convinced that it is a good value proposition then it is just a question of how you deliver it to the customer.

Also, there isn't a rendering device for the written word comparable to a book or an ipod.  Then there are DRM issues for some ebooks.<p>1) Price -- You can get the printed book with free shipping for $29.69 from Amazon.  I can only find the e-book at Apress.com.  It costs $22.50.  So I get a $7 discount when there's no shipping cost, no printing cost, no retailer cut, and no distribution cut.  There's no ebook alternative, from what I can see, at Amazon for Pro Javascript Techniques on Kindle or basic PDF.  Is the author getting any more royalty from an ebook sale even though a lot of the overhead is cut out?<p>2) Rendering device -- This is less of an issue for a programming title, because most of the readers are tethered to a computer anyway.  Still, there's very little consumer penetration for very portable ebook devices like the Sony Reader and Amazon Kindle.  (I'm talking eInk devices that you can treat like a book.)<p>The digital music market took off because the portable rendering devices are awesome relative to the traditional systems.  A little ipod delivers music just as good (to my ears) as the big stereos a decade or two before it.  It's small, easy to use, and allows easy random access.<p>Ebooks have to compete against the book, which has great random access by flipping pages, no battery issues, and is easy to mark up.  If they had an ebook reader with flexible display sheets like a page, you'd see a lot more ebooks getting sold.",1200942362

That doesn't sound like a good deal to me...<p>I invite you to name a successful country with a high standard of living which has <i>only</i> political volatility, according to your model.<p>> In addition, how on earth are you going to make water fully private?<p>Not what I was proposing. And you are correct that private property does not make a good fit ""non-excludable"" goods. However, some water is excludable (river flows, lakes, tanks, pipes) and some isn't (rain).<p>Where a thing can be traded, there are well recognised advantages to allowing that trade. Arbitrage can smooth prices across multiple markets, some derivatives can smooth prices across time. The use of floating prices allows water to mostly wind up where it is currently most urgently needed.<p>As you can imagine, we talk about water a lot in my country. We seem to have the same key distortions as everyone else: an agricultural sector that is either directly or indirectly subsidised at the expense of everyone else. Sometimes it's an industrial sector that gets the unusually cheap water.<p>Hayek has an interesting chapter in one of his books[1] (not sure which exactly) about why people distrust the market: it seems like you're being dealt an unfair hand by an invisible agent. And surely if one agent can deal a bad hand, another agent can set things to right.<p>But there was never such an agent to begin with. It was an emergent phenomenon.<p>I have a blog post outline somewhere that ties this into faces in clouds and Borges's <i>The Lottery in Bablyon</i>[2]<p>[1] The chapter title is ""'Social' or Distributive Justice"", I read it in the collection <i>Essence of Hayek</i>.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.class.uh.edu/mcl/faculty/armstrong/cityofdreams/texts/babylon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.class.uh.edu/mcl/faculty/armstrong/cityofdreams/t...</a>",1351267056

4702750,comment,4701958,4702430,6,0,mbell,,,"A small amount, perhaps.  In all likelihood your probably better off setting the volume on the device somewhere in the middle, but this will vary based on device.  Two major things come into play:<p>1) The input impedance of powered speakers or any external processing stage will be high.  ~5-10k ohms, compared to 80-500 ohms for an average set of headphones.  This means regardless of the level you use on the player the current draw will be substantially lower than it would be if driving headphones.  This means the level doesn't matter nearly as much.<p>2) The efficiency curve of the output amplifier.  Depending on the topology of the output amplifier of the device it may be more or less efficient at different power levels.  If the output driver is a class AB topology it actually gets more efficient as it nears its rated output (generally the relationship is logarithmic).  As a result you can actually be 'better' overall on power to using a higher power level at some points in the curve.  You use more power to drive the output but you also increase efficiency reducing your overall power usage. Class AB is pretty in-efficient anyway as your only going to see 30-50% peak efficiency.  With a class D output which is becoming more popular you can see upwards of 90% but your efficiency vs output power curve is generally sharper, you get much closer to peak efficiency much faster (depending on the exact design of course, most portable devices will be filter-less class D topologies).",1351266851

4702746,comment,4701952,4701952,4,0,ajiang,,,"It's important to understand that as an asset class, public equity has a certain tolerance for unpredictability and risk (lower tolerance compared to venture or growth capital). Very predictable, mature industries like utilities, industrials, and certain financial institutions offer relatively stable cashflow through thoroughly understood revenue streams -- and thus they benefit from a generally lower level of volatility. Technology firms on the other hand (Facebook being a great example) have great elements of unpredictability, along with high potential for growth, two conflicting forces that factor into stock price.<p>Take, for example, Amazon. In its recent earnings announcement, Amazon posted a loss on net income of $274 million. If Amazon replicated this result in perpetuity, it would soon be a bankrupt company. Amazon's EPS is 0.07 cents per share, giving it a price to earnings ratio of over 3,000. If you purchased Amazon at its current price and if Amazon replicated this result in perpetuity, it would take 3,000 years before you were paid back on your stock.<p>Now of course that's a silly analysis when you don't take into consideration growth and expected future cash flow. Clearly investors factor in a tremendous amount of growth in many large technology companies. However, investors are not prescient. They need indicators on the likelihood of this future growth, so factors like ad sales, product sales, new product growth, etc are extremely important. Any major shifts either above or below their expectations changes their growth estimates. Since a significant portion of their purchase price is going into future growth, any changes to growth estimates will have a magnified impact on valuation (i.e. price they're willing to pay).<p>Is there some speculation going on? Probably. But the mere act of investing in the public equity of certain technology companies is a form of speculation. And there's far more to how markets are made than can be distilled in a short article, especially if we try to generalize the forces at play.",1351266820

There's no MMU in the cores, instead of caches there is direct DMA control, and the on-chip network extends past the edges of the chip (that's all the I/O, there are no peripherals in the chip). It all adds up to something you can scale by mounting more of them on a board, assuming your task is sufficiently adaptable to a data flow (since the external bandwidth scales slower than the number of cores). It's not at a level where you can run a general purpose operating system with virtual memory and memory protection (though extending it for that would be fairly easy - perhaps Epiphany V?), nor does it (currently) run multiple threads per core, but this simplicity affords it a much lower power expense. \nA GPU may be more similar, as those tend to have prefetch operations and no memory protection, but they are designed to have huge bunches of threads doing the exact same type of work. They look like vector processors handling between 16 and 128 identical operations per control core (each a multiprocessor). Mainly the Epiphany is easier to program, but optimization is a different story (similar to place and route processes FPGAs need). \nIt's a move toward a data and control flow granularity currently not available at a price for individuals.

Most volume sliders use a logarithmic scale, where 50% basically has no meaning except in relation to the minimum value chosen by the slider.<p>This is perfectly sensible, since our sense of hearing does not scale linearly from silent to loud. Our ears have a dynamic range of about 120 dB. On a linear scale, the 50% value would correspond to about -6 dB, which is perceptually one 50th of the full audible scale.<p>A sensible volume slider (on a PC) would range about 40-60 dB, since anything below -60 dB will be lost in background noise anyway. Thus, the 50% mark would be somewhere around -20--30 dB. Thus, this 50% setting would lose roughly 5 bits of information, not one.<p>Note however that a reduced dynamic range at ""half loudness"" is usually just fine, since the full dynamic range can only be heard at high volume anyway.<p>(Also note that the bottom value of volume sliders usually mutes. Analogue equipment sometimes does not do that, which results in very faint signal playing even when turned all the way down.)<p>That said, the whole argument about losing resolution probably does not make sense anyway since the operating system volume sliders attenuate the sound hardware DAC gain instead of actually decreasing digital gain...",1351265682

From what I could grasp what sets them apart the most is a different memory architecture compared to multicore CPUs, where the individual cores seem to be optimized for accessing adjacent memory locations as well as the locations of the direct neighbors. This is one point where the architecture seems to be similar to GPUs, although GPUs have a very different memory architecture again - for the programmer it might look similar however, especially when using OpenCL.<p>The main point where Epiphany is diverging from GPUs is that the individual cores are complete RISC environments. This could mainly be a big plus when it comes to branching and subprocedure calls (although NVIDIA is catching up on the later point with Kepler 2). On GPUs the kernel subprocedures currently all need to be inlined and branches mean that the cores that aren't executing the current branch are just sleeping - Epiphany cores seem to be more independent in that regard. I still expect an efficient programming model to be along the same lines as CUDA/OpenCL for epiphany however - which is a good thing btw., this model has been very successful in the high performance community and it's actually quite easy to understand - much easier than cache optimizing for CPU for example.<p>If we compare epiphany to CPU what's mainly missing is the CPU's cache architecture, hyperthreading, long pipelines per core, SSE on each core, possibly out-of-order and intricate branch prediction (not sure on those last ones). The missing caches might be a bit of a problem. The memory bandwidth they specify seems pretty good to me, but from personal experience I'd add another 20-30% to the achievable bandwidth if you have a good cache (which GPU has since Fermi for example). The other simplifications I actually like a lot - to me it makes much more sense to have a massive parallel system where you can just specify everything as scalar instead of doing all the SSE and hyperthreading hoops like on CPUs - optimizing for CPU is quite a pain compared to those new models.",1351265584

I use a Pomodoro timer (actually a cheap one I got locally) to stay focussed on the mechanical things. I do actually record the number of pomodoros I spend on crap, and I feed that back when things get out of hand.<p>Students who don't like Maths much also find a kitchen timer helps them to focus, so I break homework up into 'pomodoros' of each topic. Strangely, they find the more pomodoros they do, the easier it all gets.<p>In non-pomodoro time, I do things like reflect on what kind of activity works, make screencasts, quizzes and games, and make new ways of linking topics (e.g. areas and perimeters of rectangles and simple factors and multiples).<p>Outside of work I too like taking things slowly!

It's general purpose cores.<p>What sets it apart is that the cores are tiny, with little per-core memory (though all cores can transparently access each-others memory as well as main memory), and so the architecture is well suited for scaling up the number of cores with quite low power consumption.<p>So for problems that can be parallelized reasonably well, but with more complex data dependencies than what a GPU is good for, this might be a good fit.<p>I'd put it somewhere in the middle between GPU's (for embarrassingly parallel tasks) and general purpose CPU's with high throughput per core.<p>Also, this looks like it'd be possible to fit in the power envelope of really small embedded systems, like e.g. cellphones and tablets....<p>Before more developers have these systems, it'll be hard to say how useful they'll be, but the architecture looks exciting.<p>That's why I supported it - I really want to see how this type of architecture can be exploited, and whether or not it'll prove to be cost effective and/or simpler to work with than GPU's for the right type of problems.",1351264759

4702486,comment,4701657,4701657,3,0,talmand,,,"It's interesting to read an article like this. As a PC gamer, for most of my life I'm accustomed to seeing articles telling me that my hobby is dead and I might as well buy a console. It's different to see one that claims the console as we know it is dead. I see it as the console is finally catching up with the PC in terms of functionality. But I admit that could just be me.<p>But I find parts of the article confusing or maybe I just outright disagree.<p>I don't understand this common comparison of mobile games with console games. They are not the same thing and not the same market. The mobile game market is in serious growth (except for Zynga, one example of the article) because, as the article points out, it is a new market and there's a vacuum to fill. This has happened before and not just in the gaming sector. Once things have settled let's see how that market holds up. But to constantly compare these two markets just feels wrong. To me it would be like saying since the Honda Accord has such strong sales then clearly Ferrari is destined to fail and die.<p>Consoles used to do everything best? In what dimension did this happen? Most PC games didn't require messing with ""finicky settings"" since Win95, yes indeed they just ""worked"". Well, maybe not Games for Windows Live games. Especially with the release of Steam, which the article points out but doesn't seem to make the connection. High end games that push the hardware may require some love and care but there's not many of those. Braid, Super Meatboy and others like them, that do make money for their developers, just work.<p>How is Ubisoft going to squeeze money from their customers by offering a $120 collectors edition with a $30 season pass? Is that the only option or maybe most people will get the regular $60 version and maybe buy the DLC later? What about people like me who are willing to wait for those wonderful Steam sales?<p>It's funny to me that article says that AAA games are getting more and more expensive to produce, which is true, and then just a few paragraphs later it describes EA's massive campus. So, does most of EA's budget go towards game development or nice expensive, unneeded office space?  Do the large salaries of managers who are not involved in development nor know the first thing about development involved in that equation? Assassin's Creed III involves five Ubisoft offices around the world and just costs too much? How much of its budget is actually for development?<p>What is an AAA game title anyway? Who defines that? Maybe the publishers should rethink what they think a AAA title is and the market think it is. If AAA refers to quality then Super Meatboy is a AAAA title and was primarily made by two guys with contractors.<p>Everything they mention about the dark days of PC gaming is pretty much true. But they fail to mention that the big publishers attempted to treat the PC game market the same as the console market, which you cannot do and the market reacted. Once they failed in the PC game market they then started a campaign of blaming their customers. Don't get me started on the stupid DRM schemes that punished paying customers more than pirates. Maybe DRM is what's responsible for those finicky PC games that don't ""just work""? That's one reason why the indie market and alternatives like Steam work, they understand their market. Which is really funny is that the big publishers were hesitant to adopt to the market and now all of the sudden indie developers and Valve are just geniuses. The market was screaming years ago what we wanted and we were ignored.<p>Firefall is a PC first-person shooter that is attempting to get hardcore gamers to accept free? WTF? There are already numerous games that follow this model accepted by hardcore gamers. Tribes and TeamFortress2 are two easy ones right off the bat. Firefall is a gorgeous game that's on graphical par with the best console shooters? WTF is this guy going on about? Did he even bother to do research on PC games before writing this?<p>Nice to know that the apps on the iTunes app store that make the most money are the free ones, although I'm not sure if that's true. That was one of the largest complaints about the Android market, they didn't want to pay for anything.<p>After talking about how much all these AAA games cost to make, we're left with a quote of why buy a $60 game when the $1 game on my phone is just more of the same. What? Is this saying that the $1 is the same thing as the $60? Which doesn't make sense. Or is it saying that the $60 is not worth buying because it's the same as the last $60 game? Because that's been the console strategy for years and another example of the big publishers not listening to the market.<p>I love the references to Zynga and EA, since they are commonly the most disliked game companies in the community and industry.",1351264504

4702484,comment,4701321,4701321,43,0,oz,,,"Ignoring the semantic controversy on 'mastery' and 'expertise', here's my story.<p>I dropped out of a CS program after first year. I was the classic case of a student who had always been told he was brilliant, so I never worked very hard. In high school, I coasted along simply on a fantastic memory, often 'studying' for the final exams that determine graduation the night before. I never learned how to learn.<p>Going to college was like being thrown into a bath of cold water. I had never been particularly conscientious, so being in an environment where I was now responsible for my learning was new to me. I skipped lectures, forgot homework that was due, turned in coursework late; the usual suspects. On raw talent though, I qualified for 2nd year, only failing Pre-Calculus. (I skipped the classes and tried to learn math from 1st principles. Ugh...)<p>I got a summer job at a small telecom startup. By time 2nd year rolled around, my student loan was denied, so I dropped out. I'd always hated school, so I didn't care. I never applied for leave of absence, nothing. I just didn't show up in September. That was 2006.<p>I was 20 then. I'm 26 now. I've had a lot of time (6 years!) to reflect on why I did so poorly despite being talented (not being conceited; my lecturers in 1st year said as much). There are quite a few reasons; but the major one is that <i>I didn't know how to learn.</i> So if something didn't immediately click, I'd give up in frustration, and decry the teacher as an idiot who couldn't teach (oftentimes true; but irrelevant). I didn't know there was another way.<p>Being around HN and places like LessWrong which exposes you to so many thought-leaders brought about some interesting side-effects, which culminated earlier this year. Upon reading an article on LW entitled ""Humans are not automatically strategic"", which was a reply to a Sebastian Marshall article ""A failure to evaluate return on time fallacy"", I had an epiphany that being <i>systematic</i> about things was the route to accomplishing great things. ""Rationalists should win"", the LW meme goes, and it's correct. I came to realize that <i>for every goal, there exists an efficient path to achieve it.</i> My task was to find that path, and execute ruthlessly upon it.<p>Since then I've made leaps and bounds in my personal development. I still slack off sometimes, but I won't fall into my old perfectionist way of thinking that I'm a failure. It's better to be 80% there than 0%.<p>I made the decision a few weeks ago to get my CS degree, albeit at a different, larger university. Since then, I've been devouring articles like this one. I recently bought two of Cal's books and wanna sometimes slap myself when I realize that if I had had this knowledge and the discipline to implement it 6 years ago, my life would be so much better. But c'est la vie. These articles on meta-learning are priceless.<p>So if you're in school now, or are going soon, pay attention to articles like these, Here are a few gems I've dug up recently:\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3427762"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3427762</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=818157"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=818157</a><p><a href=""http://www.quora.com/The-College-and-University-Experience/How-do-some-people-get-near-4-0-GPAs-in-college"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/The-College-and-University-Experience/H...</a><p><a href=""http://www.quora.com/Harvard-College/What-are-the-best-Harvard-College-study-hacks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Harvard-College/What-are-the-best-Harva...</a><p><a href=""http://www.quora.com/How-do-top-students-study"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/How-do-top-students-study</a><p>Thanks to knowledge like this from Cal Newport and others, I'm going back to college full-time as someone with an above-average cognitive toolset, and a myriad of experiences that will suit me. I'm <i>much</i> more sociable, have a great eye for design having moonlighted as a freelancer some years back, and will now know how to engage my lecturers on an adult level rather than the kid I was 6 years ago. I'm going for a 4.3 GPA.

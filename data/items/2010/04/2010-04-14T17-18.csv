1265591,comment,1265327,1265327,0,0,confusedcitizen,,,"If an individual decides to be highly competitive by working crazy hours, is that considered bad? Will her colleagues complain to the labor department? A capitalist country's inhabitants, who belong to a system driven only by output and profit, complaining about labor practices, is the biggest oxymoron. Surely, the Chinese industries tactics are understandable?<p>In order for the Chinese manufacturing industry to be competitive, they indulge in such practices. If you want to remain competitive, one way is to cut costs or increase production, the way they do or by way of technological innovation. Or create high quality products, that consumers would want to buy, instead of the cheap {quality, cost} ones made in China.<p>The opponents of outsourcing are surely barking up the wrong tree. The Chinese workers surely have a choice of not working there. Agreed, that if they choose to work, life is pretty much miserable. But what if they choose not to work there. Do they go back to their non-existent farms, or to the streets? If such labor laws are enforced, the obvious impact is that oursourcing would move elsewhere. There will always be some country willing to take it up, and not to mention the people who would welcome a respite from their poverty.<p>The Chinese industry has decided to stay competitive. The people are probably between the devil or the deep sea, and it's all about choosing the better path, which in this case, simply is working 15 hours a day.",1271267998

Inhumane conditions are inhumane no matter where they are, and no matter what the situation is in the society; it is never right to do to one's workers what this article is describing, not even if there's a lot of competition for their jobs.<p>This is the kind of thing that explains why the United States is not lassiez-faire capitalist anymore; and it emphasizes that we should forswear our addiction to shopping cheap, in favor of buying what is produced in a morally licit fashion, and genuinely punishing corporate leaders over whom the US has jurisdiction and who knowingly go along with this kind of thing. I don't mean sanctions directed at the corporation: I mean punishing the individuals who sign off on or turn a blind eye to this, and I think that a crucial part of any such punishment, in addition to a long prison sentence, is the confiscation of the individual's personal fortune -- since this kind of person (well, almost always ""this kind of man"") sees money as score, and his objective is to die with a score high enough to leave his initials on the game's attract screen.<p>I want to emphasize here that this is not partisan United States issue, either. I am a serious Catholic; I vote Republican and like the Tea Party movement; and I know that this kind of thing is wrong, and that you don't have to be a Green, ""pro-choice,"" or a gun-control advocate to recognize it as such.",1271267943

The island has gone from an agrarian backwater to one of the urban jewels of the Pacific. I am glad that this has happened - and yet I'm not convinced it would have gone down that well if well-meaning Western labor activists had their way.<p>I do think that fundamental worker safety must be ensured - companies certainly have proven that they can't be trusted to do that on their own, but enforcing someone's ""right"" to use a cell phone while working?

Prejudice, whether it manifests itself in the form of latent tribal/racial preference or in sex/gender assumptions, is simply an indicator that the template-matching engine in the nearly autonomous, more primitive and survival-oriented areas of our brains are working properly. It takes training to associate ""girl jobs"" with girls and ""boy jobs"" with boys, or to associate skin tone with stereotype (and may we find a way to stop passing on our own training), but the recognition of ""other"" is probably vital to the survival of the individual. It's how we ""smell danger"" in details of our surroundings we may not have time to become consciously aware of.

In theory if the star's rotating fast enough and you see it side-on, then roughly half the star's light will be slightly blue-shifted (travelling towards you) and half will be red-shifted (away from you). As the planet crosses the star, it will block light coming from one half of the star, then light from the middle, then from the other half.<p>If there's a dip in the red-shifted part of the spectrum, in time transitioning to a dip in the blue, then you know the planet is moving against the star's rotation.

There's an R to Clojure bridge, but if you don't yet know R I'm not sure it's very helpful.<p>Finally, Incanter is developing at a break-neck pace.

8349877,comment,8347446,8347446,1,0,hollerith,,,"I&#x27;m a big Emacs user -- have been since 1991 -- and Homebrew-emacs (the subject of this Show HN) seems like a very good idea to me.<p>Homebrew has become the most popular and most important package manager on OS X.  More people use Homebrew (and consequently have invested time learning how to use, configure and modify Homebrew) than use Emacs. Although I know that the following opinion is subjective, I am tempted to assert that Homebrew is <i>more important</i> than Emacs -- not only more important than any package manager implemented in Emacs Lisp, but also more important than any Emacs package or any file or coherent collection of files of Emacs Lisp code.<p>I have installed a few packages into my emacs using package.el (which comes with Emacs these days). I don&#x27;t like package.el very much. All I can remember (in the 20 minutes or so since I started reading this story on HN) about package.el without looking it up is that M-x list-packages is often useful as a first move in trying to get package.el to do what I want. Most software distributed with Emacs by the FSF is well implemented, but a lot of it is also poorly designed.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong -- I&#x27;m not going to stop being heavy Emacs user any time in the forseeable future. It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;ve learned long ago that it is a waste of my time to learn or master <i>all</i> of the functionality distributed as part of Emacs.<p>One more thing. At this moment, I have 32 Homebrew packages installed.  My memory tells me that I have 2 or 3 packages installed in my Emacs via package.el, but my memory is unreliable, and there is no way in hell I&#x27;m going to invest the <i>tedious</i> time and mental energy required to figure out how to get Emacs to tell me how many packages I have installed at this moment.  In contrast, my determining that I have 32 Homebrew packages installed required almost no thought at all.  Right away I knew how to get the information, and the whole process took me at most 5 or 10 seconds.<p>It involved the command line &quot;brew leaves&quot;. I dont have &quot;brew leaves&quot; memorized, but I knew that somewhere in my .emacs.d is a call-process call to /usr/local/bin/brew that essentially lists all the packages I have installed, so searching my .emacs.d for the string &quot;brew&quot; got me the information I needed (namely, the Homebrew command is &quot;leaves&quot;) in a matter of seconds.",1411379527

Is there any way for the ADA to show itself unaffected other than getting rid of sponsorship, and of it does, would the result be worse for those with diabetes?<p>I find it easier to believe that a diabetes researcher whose parents have diabetes is less likely to be concerned about the profit/loss statement of a sponsoring company and more concerned about the parents.<p>I also find it harder than you to believe there is consistent capture across all research organizations in the world. I agree that the USDA food guide is incorrectly and unduly influenced by money and politics. But that&#x27;s not the only food guide in the world and the US isn&#x27;t the only research system.<p>Other countries also have different economic goals that the US system. If a country has a single-payer national health care, and fund health research, then it&#x27;s more likely to fund research in ways to reduce its health care payments.<p>While I agree that pharma money can and does buy influence, especially when things are ambiguous, I think that big inconsistencies across different health care and research systems is hard to pull off. I also think orthodoxy is hard to enforce in the way you suggest, especially since there&#x27;s a long practice of unorthodox publications becoming part of the new orthodoxy, even to the point of winning the Nobel Prize.<p>Regarding diet, the diabetes literature is vast and I know very little of it. I know that those with diabetes are told to stop eating as much sugar. I&#x27;m surprised to hear that the opposite - eating more sugar - is the better diet. It&#x27;s more likely that I don&#x27;t understand your point.<p>In a cursory review (I read care.diabetesjournals.org/content/34/1/14.full ) it seems that:<p>> Observational studies have also shown that diets rich in vegetables and low in red meat and whole-fat dairy products are associated with a decreased risk of diabetes, whereas dietary patterns rich in red meats, processed foods, refined grains, and sweets increase diabetes risk<p>> Recently, a clinical trial showed that, compared with a low-fat diet, a MedDiet allowed better glycemic control and delayed the need for antidiabetes drug treatment in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes (11). However, the role of the MedDiet in the prevention of diabetes has not been tested in a clinical trial.<p>Which safe dietary interventions studies are you talking about?

In fact, the whole point of a concurrent algorithm like C4 is to dramatically reduce GC-related synchronization overhead [stop-the-world pauses are dramatic synchronization points between GC and mutator threads].<p>The main overhead of a concurrent, compacting collector is the need for read barrier. You simply cannot move data while the program is running without having a way of redirecting the read requests to the latest memory location. It&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s technically not <i>multi-core</i> related overhead (instead, it&#x27;s a <i>multi-threading</i> related overhead), but the point is moot, since with a single core, you don&#x27;t need multiple threads (in a managed language, you can simply use fibres (user-space threads), like Go or Haskell do).

Many countries that are considered rich have high poverty rates. Such as the US.<p>> Or why Brazil, Mexico and South Africa have far more crime than India.<p>Apart from what I wrote above, all of these countries have massive poverty rates. I haven&#x27;t checked all three, but South Africa&#x27;s poverty level is at least under some measures at similar levels to India. Mexico also have a massive US-fueled drug war that accounts for a substantial proportion of all crime to the extent that it mostly swamps out most other factors.<p>But of course, this alone is not very relevant unless you - unlike me - assume poverty is the <i>only</i> factor.<p>> If you want to use a relative definition of poverty (e.g. what Norway does), then you need to postulate that the existence of someone earning more than you do within a national boundary is what causes you to murder people.<p>No, I don&#x27;t. You&#x27;re making up strawmen again.<p>The reason for pointing out the relative definition was to make it clear that the US definition (which is also relative - the specific numbers are adjusted regularly) and Norwegian definitions are not directly comparable, and that Norway&#x27;s 4.5% number is vastly higher than it would have been under a US definition.<p>As such, we can not with confidence say that if the US brought poverty down to 4.5% after the US definition, even all else being equal, it would provide sufficiently stable living conditions to make it possible to reap whatever level of benefit the Norwegian system does from reduced poverty.<p>This was to address your issue of how much social security would be enough, after the ludicrous claim that the US tried to provide social security in the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s, and that it didn&#x27;t have any positive effect on crime rates, and my counter-claim that the US have never seriously tried to provide proper social security.<p>Also, despite your aggressive and rude way of asking for me to support my claims, you&#x27;ve provided nothing but that in defence of <i>your</i> claims. I take your aggression and rudeness and lack of support for your own claims as a good indicator that you have nothing.<p>>  Assume poverty is the sole cause of homicide<p>Nice strawman. Pretty much your entire line of reasoning appears to be founded on setting up strawmen. Has anyone suggested poverty is the sole cause of homicide? No. I suggested that differences in poverty levels was one major factor confounding the claimed link between homicide and race. The rest is your own invention.<p>> I don&#x27;t know what you mean by &quot;tack on&quot;. Do you have a coherent theory, or are you just hoping?<p>By &quot;tack on&quot; I meant that, unlike what you seem to believe, I have never claimed poverty to the be the only factor. In fact, I originally pointed to <i>social status</i> specifically of those other factors.<p>I don&#x27;t see the point in continuing this discussion and trying to explain anything to you, as you seem intent on misinterpreting every word, or you would have seen that &quot;my&quot; two theories are quite simple:<p>1) Poverty level (your own, and that of your immediate community, though they are usually largely the same) has a substantial effect on crime rate. You can falsify this theory by correcting for poverty levels in crime rate data, and see what difference it makes to the crime rate in the population reviewed.<p>2) If you adjust for factors that influence social status, the vast majority in the gap between crime rates for African Americans and white Americans will disappear. These factors include poverty, but also other factors such as education level and family cohesion.<p>The main point is not the specific set of factors, but that there are confounding factor that needs to be corrected for, that has dramatic effect on levelling the inter-racial differences in crime rates.<p>To falsify this, I don&#x27;t need for there to be evidence of the specific effects of poverty on crime, as controlling for poverty and other such factors when looking at crime rates broken down by ethnic groups will either yield a result or not.",1411376653

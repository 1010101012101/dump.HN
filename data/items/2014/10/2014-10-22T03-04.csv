8491415,comment,8491133,8491374,0,0,robert_tweed,,,"Recurrent neural networks work that way, but typically when anyone says &quot;neural network&quot; they mean a feed-forward network, which is as dumb as a lead pipe. It has no memory other than the trained synapse weights. After training, all it does is transform some input data into output data. It&#x27;s a pure function. It&#x27;s also a lot like a matrix transform.<p>I haven&#x27;t read this paper fully yet, but it seems to be an attempt at simplifying RNNs by replacing some of the magic internal state, which tends to make them hard to reason about, with a more direct memory architecture.",1413950188

For instance, I would like to see some substantiation that living within the bay area or new york are key indicators of startup success.<p>The primary method by which startups fail is running out of capital, that&#x27;s pretty much the definition of failure. Yet these two locations are some of the most expensive locations in the country.<p>If you take a filter of all software or hardware technology startups across the US, across all states in the past decade, and then look at their failure rates, I bet you will find that the odds of success are higher outside of these two locations.<p>NY and SF probably have a lot more total startups and thus total winners -- but that&#x27;s also because they both have spigots of money flowing into a lot of bad ideas.  Many of those bad ideas last long enough to be acquired, often for the team or for tools, without ever having been a success in the marketplace.   These exits would be considered &quot;success&quot; by this analysis, but they aren&#x27;t actually success.<p>So, look at how many entities are still in business 10 years later.<p>I bet outside of California and New York, mortality rates are actually lower.<p>Of course, I can&#x27;t prove this.

Some were my age.  Rarely was anyone younger.<p>When I emerged from a deep stint with a company (2000-06), the age distribution had shifted dramatically to people in their 20s.

They either outright retired or moved to different careers; some survived, but moved on anyway.  Some had died.<p>Those that remained in technology went three different routes.

I contribute to open source, answer questions on Stack Overflow, present at technical meet ups. I solve problems that need solving even when no one else will step up.<p>Despite all of my experience, implementing hashes and sorting linked lists in place, as well as many of the other questions asked by these companies just don&#x27;t come up on a daily basis. A good developer isn&#x27;t someone who can explain those things in an interview, it is someone that can examine the problem and design a solution. They should have an idea of the tools necessary and then reach for the right book or use a healthy dose of google searching some api docs to build the solution.<p>The current interviewing techniques are broken. I would like to offer the solution, but quite frankly I&#x27;ve spent plenty of time interviewing people and we haven&#x27;t gotten it down yet either.<p>-------<p>The ideas Malcolm Gladwell discusses in, &quot;Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking&quot;, applies here.

Failure to do so means risking that someone will not only beat them at their own game, but will do so at their expense. Same goes for Google, etc. So yes, it is perfectly reasonable to share a lot of very personal data with them while expecting that much of it will be carefully protected. After all, the stratospherically high value of their position depends on the <i>inability</i> of others to connect the very fine-grained demographic profiles they create with the specific individuals behind them.<p>Given this reasonable expectation of privacy, it makes more sense to see these third-parties more like doctors, priests, or accountants. Yes, they&#x27;re all third parties too. But they&#x27;re ones who we <i>absolutely</i> expect to protect our privacy.

8491333,comment,8490871,8490871,0,0,waps,,,"> Top officials at the Treasury Department are discussing the need to bolster fortifications around a critical area of cybersecurity: outside vendors, which include law firms, accounting and marketing firms and even janitorial companies, according to several people briefed on the matter.<p>> The push by government officials is a stark acknowledgment of the vulnerability of financial institutions to an attack — even after they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to protect themselves — if one of their vendors is not fully prepared.<p>This makes you seriously wonder. Apparently, janitorial companies get sufficient network access at JP Morgan to download client lists. Apparently that is quite common at wall street banks.<p>Then again, having worked at one, this doesn&#x27;t really surprise me. The only thing that has a decent security architecture is the transaction processing systems (and they&#x27;re not isolated from each other either).<p>And at one of those banks the reason that janitorial company managers have access to client lists is that copies are stored as excel spreadsheets on smb shares and management can&#x27;t be bothered with access lists, so all is set to public access.",1413947310

8491323,comment,8486324,8490244,0,0,kazagistar,,,"Whatever system is selected would measure competency at least as well as the current one, and almost certainly better. We already need to measure competence, we just mix that measurement with &quot;an ability to learn at a specific rate&quot;. If you want to go faster or slower, you either have to self educate or fail and retry, respectively.<p>The modern educational system is already pushing the idea of a reverse classroom, where lectures are on your own time, and homework and questions are done in the classroom. Desynchronizing the exact progress through the material is much simpler in this sort of environment. (Of course, it is important not to totally screw those people who rely on the structure and rigour of a formal schedule, or the cooperation of classmates; it is easy to focus too much on averages and ignore outliers).<p>Personally, I prefer to on binges (spend 30+ hours in a few days on a single subject, then don&#x27;t touch the subject for a few weeks). However, the educational system specifically discourages this, insisting that you you have deadlines, learn extensively within specific well-defined subjects, discuss things as a team, attend each lecture, and so on. If you fail to follow this structure, you fail, if you follow, you pass. If you cram for tests at the exact right time, you even get a good evaluation. It evaluates your ability to fit the system with high accuracy, and your competence with mediocre accuracy. Removing the unnecessary part of that would have to increase the overall accuracy, right?",1413946802

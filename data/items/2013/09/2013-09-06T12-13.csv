His critique is saying that if this is the way she treats the logo redesign (even celebrates the casualness of the approach) then is she actually a competent steward for the Yahoo brand.<p>I think it&#x27;s a question worth asking and find that many of the comments here seem very focused on the debate about the merits of the logo design, rather than the question of brand management which both the piece, and thankfully your comment, at least attempt to address.",1378472299

Another thing that people don&#x27;t get immediately is that you&#x27;re not signalling at the visual medium on the screen to perform tasks, rather, the screen doesn&#x27;t matter at all. It&#x27;s a sensory feedback loop adjustment that takes a few hours of tinkering around, but once you get it, you get it. The main problem is gorilla arm and the tediousness of some tasks, the latter of which will hopefully be solved in software. Check out the 3D skull explorer app if you get a chance, it&#x27;s the best implementation of gestures I&#x27;ve seen for the Leap, actually usable. I could definitely see people who regularly need to manipulate 3D models using similar metaphors.",1378472240

I was hoping that you guys might be able to point me at a cloud storage solution that copes well with large <i>numbers</i> of files (>300k) on mac at a reasonable price point + preferable allows you to manipulate large numbers of files on the server side (through a web interface or alternative.)<p>An important note - it&#x27;s very easy to get to large numbers of files if you ever a. store open source code you&#x27;re playing with in your cloud solution, b. use git (it generates a lot of files.) - so 300k+ files isn&#x27;t as outlandish a number as it sounds.<p>Background for those that are interested -<p>* I noticed the client was using 100% CPU and never seemed to enter the &#x27;synced&#x27; state. A google suggested this was due to too many files, + a reinstall/cache clear could fix. Did this.<p>* 1 week later - No change. Contact support and received boilerplate copy/paste replies telling me it was too many files + either remove files/use selective sync. The latter crashes dropbox. Did the former.<p>* Several days later - no change, so send another email whereby I am told symlinks are the cause, despite the fact they&#x27;ve worked for over a year. I move all code (node_modules contain symlinks typically) from my dropbox leaving ~20k files left in there.<p>* Several days later - Still no change, so I try deleting files on the web interface. It won&#x27;t let me delete a folder with more than an unstated number of files in it. Support suggest I manually delete 100&#x27;s of thousands of files.<p>* Dropbox client starts overwriting files as I work on them.<p>* Support staff stop responding to emails.<p>The dropbox client could have at least <i>warned</i> me about the files, if this is an intractable problem. No. Silent failure.",1378472143

Its gaining trust. Ironically, for that you need a reflective, clear, and consistent brand identity. A different logo powered by bullshit doesnt convey identity and trustworthiness. It conveys desperation.</i><p>While the overall sentiment of the article is sound, I slightly disagree with this. First, this whole story of &quot;creating the logo in a weekend&quot; with an &quot;intern who did some motion graphics to convey it&#x27;s uniformity&quot; is pure and simple, a publicity stunt, and a good one at that.[1] Personally I don&#x27;t think there is an intern named Max who did that (most likely an agency), but this subtly conveys the perception of something that Yahoo is missing - innovation by small teams. The reality is that Yahoo <i>does</i> have a brand problem (just as MS does in the consumer-mobile space), so they have two tactics they need to implement in order to properly manage the brand:<p>1. Change the perception of the brand (changing the logo to match the new found brand perception is a good way to do that)<p>2. Create buzz around the fact that the perception has now changed.<p>Marissa&#x27;s plan for the logo did just that. I think it&#x27;s a good strategy and something Stringer Bell would have been taught in his business class.[2]<p>[1]-<a href=""http://marissamayr.tumblr.com/post/60336044815/geeking-out-on-the-logo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marissamayr.tumblr.com/post/60336044815/geeking-out-o...</a><p>[2]-<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbbZc2pab9k"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbbZc2pab9k</a>",1378472138

6340111,comment,6339842,6339842,17,0,smacktoward,,,"I&#x27;m of two minds on this piece.<p>On the one hand, the author is absolutely right that a good professional designer can bring things to the process that enthusiastic amateurs cannot. A really good logo doesn&#x27;t just look cool, it communicates something about the nature and spirit of the company visually. It lays down a marker: &quot;this is who we are.&quot; A designer who knows the grammar of visual communication will have a better chance of delivering that than will someone who doesn&#x27;t.<p>On the other hand, the author sadly doesn&#x27;t do a great job of arguing the above point. Rather than, say, taking some great logos and pulling them apart for us to show how they do what they do, we just hear a lot of complaints about how the way Yahoo did theirs was &quot;unprofessional.&quot; It makes it sound like the main complaint is that Yahoo had the gall to cut designers out of the process rather than that <i>they chose a path that was more likely to result in a crappy logo</i>, which strikes me as a more powerful (and accurate) complaint.<p>In other words, outside the community of professional designers, nobody cares if Marissa Mayer hurt some designers&#x27; feelings. What they care about is how Marissa Mayer is stewarding the Yahoo brand. If you want to convince them that your way is right and her way is wrong, don&#x27;t show them how her way threatens <i>your</i> business; show them how her way threatens <i>her</i> business.",1378471493

It is higher, but we&#x27;re talking 20-30% higher, maybe 50% at the end of your career, no more.

Yeah, it's true that there are some people who have addiction ""issues"" with porn to that point that it negatively affects their lives.  Some people have obsessive/addictive reactions to lots of other things as well: alcohol and other drugs, gambling, food (I'm referring to eating disorders, not our need to eat to stay alive), WoW, etc.<p>2. For most addictive things, there develops an ""industry"" around them that thrives on sensationalizing and over-stating the problems caused.   As one example, this article tries to create a link by association between declining birth rates and porn.<p>3. The rise of anti-<whatever> groups usually leads to calls for legislation, and such legislation quite often has nasty unintended consequences (cf Prohibition, the war on marijuana use, etc).  Even if that article is partially accurate about the effect of porn on some people, the correct actions to take, if any, are probably not the obvious ones.",1278276492

But seriously, funding research doesn't need to be thought of as ""picking winners.""   For example, I think the NSF does an admirable job of funding longer-term research using peer review to decide which ideas are funded.  Some wild ideas are funded when proposal authors can make a good case for their research, others are not.  Many ideas fail, but the externalities of the research process are positive - Ph.D. students learn to be effective researchers and many will contribute later in industry.<p>But I agree with much of your statement:
1. Governments shouldn't pick the winners, particularly too early in the process.  (but I don't have a problem with funding promising ideas to promote their development)
2. I also agree that a fossil-fuel tax would be a good way of enlisting the power of private industry to find good solutions to the problem.   But in the short term, it would surely draw the ire of those unaccustomed to paying for these externalities.",1278276179

Basically I ""ramp up"" to a complete implementation by starting out on something and seeing if it has a major flaw.<p>If it's coding up something deep and algorithmic(e.g. recently I started implementing a small scripting language and associated type inference engine), I'm going to be buried in it more-or-less continously for however many days it takes.<p>If it's debugging the deep algorithm, I'll work on it off-and-on(the stage I'm in now with the type system project) in blocks of an hour to a few hours at a time. This is the stage where a lot of insight is needed so I don't push myself too much to ""force"" solutions to appear.<p>If it's a ""trivial features + fixes"" type of thing, I'll procrastinate a ton and then take the hour or two needed to finish.

The question 'can entropy be reversed?' acts as a brilliant 'hook' for the story as he fleshes out the history of the universe.

Because I can tell you from personal experience that often those things take up much of my time, and tend to burn me out a bit so that when I have free time,  I hang out with my friends and work on personal projects that I enjoy rather than studying the material I just did for homework. If I had more free time available, and less work to do, I would most likely read my book more thoroughly, especially in classes that I enjoy.",1278274104

1486285,comment,1485922,1485922,0,0,irrelative,,,"The hatred of linux on the desktop is terribly cliche, especially on a site targeted towards hackers.  Linux on my desktop is the greatest development environment I've ever used, having played extensively with OSX and Windows as well. I can easily install new libraries and ""apt-get source"" allows me to tinker with existing software easily and immediately build and execute the results. All of the development environment is thoroughly documented.<p>But now, some influential people start saying how much better their version is. Specifically their closed, sealed-off, experience-driven version. Arguing ""ease of use"" and ""shiny end user experience"" rings really hollow to me. I use vim -- think I care about easy to use or shiny user experiences? -- and  I use it because it's a powerful tool for its job. I just don't get it when hackers start telling other hackers that they should use a more restrictive environment because it'll make them feel better or is easier to use. Instead, ask yourself: is it the most powerful tool for the job?<p>So sure, tell your parents and siblings to buy an iPhone. Hell, use your iPhone for anything you can -- it's a fantastic device.  But stop telling future developers that it's worth giving up control for rounded corners and subtle shadows. And stop comparing its competition negatively to an environment that I, and others, find superior to any other.",1278274015

1486273,comment,1485538,1485661,0,0,arghnoname,,,"Globals can make sense. In C it isn't unusual at all to see a variable that is global in file scope only, which is similar in effect to how class variables are treated within the class definition in a variety of OOP languages.<p>The problem is PHP's scoping rules don't lend themselves well to this kind of thing. If you were to use a PHP library, for instance, that used the same practices you are using, say a parser, you might find that depending on the include order $look_ahead now means something different.<p>This kind of ""all I did is include a file and everything broke"" error is really annoying to find. Constants are useful for this, because at least it will flag an error/warning. Now that PHP has (is getting? It's been a while) namespaces, you can limit its scope and make it less likely to collide.<p>For the case of databases, it is fairly common to use PHP's builtin functionality to reuse the database connection without having to rely on a global handle. Again, if someone shares your practices the variable could end up getting stepped on. Throw in autoloading and maybe it only occurs when some confluence of events leads to some specific file being included that usually isn't.<p>So there's a reason for concerns about globals. Putting everything in a singleton with static variables is not really different, but in my mind mostly just namespaces it so your globals don't get in trouble with someone else's globals. I've found in practice that I've only rarely needed global variables or singleton classes housing global variables. This probably largely depends on your style of coding.<p>I haven't written in PHP for years now so if I've gotten any details wrong please forgive me. Hopefully though you can see some ways that frequent use of globals can lead to hard to find bugs. A lot of programming techniques (OOP, closures, for example) are designed to help pass around state in ways that don't lead to these kinds of problems.",1278273679

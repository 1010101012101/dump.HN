Well, I'm convinced. :P<p>To put it in a less snarky way, sure, inline asm is great, but it's just a compiler-dependent extension.  Also, there are plenty of non-C language compilers that implement it.<p>The preprocessor, OTOH, is somewhat more of a necessary evil when dealing with C.  Beyond giving symbolic names to constants without having to actually allocate memory for them, the only real, good use I can think of for it is conditional compilation (which, granted, is a pretty good use).  Oh, and, as devinj points out, the preprocessor has nothing really to do with C.<p>Pointers, I'll admit, are a great feature, but did he really have to give such a lousy example?

As another commenter wrote, investors as an aggregate are the market (hedgers, as another listed, are also considered, or could be considered investors who are investing for reasons other than direct belief in the individual companies/stocks).</i><p>Fair enough, I set myself up for that.  It sort of like, ""if a million people join this group, this group will have a million members"", though.<p><i>3. You talk about option strategies, but for every move you make, say buying a call, another party had to have written the option. For individual investors, your point could still be very accurate. However, at some scale (though ridiculously large these days), this will break down.</i><p>But both parties theoretically benefit.  Imagine you want to sell some stock, but you don't care that it happens today.  Just write a call for it, collect your premium, and if the stock hits the strike price, it will probably be called away.  But if not, you got some free money.<p>On the other side, the call buyer is protected against a severe market fall.  If he bought the stock and it pulls an Enron, he would have lost a significant amount of money.  But if he has the call option, it just expires, and he is out a few bucks per share.<p>So as with anything, spending money isn't necessarily taking a loss, but getting the money <i>is</i> taking a gain.  (Consider homeowner's insurance -- even though your house is probably not going to burn down, few people consider the insurance a waste of money.  You win peace of mind, and the insurance company gets some chump change.)<p>But I guess we mostly agree.  I spent a long time thinking there was nothing interesting about the stock market and that everyone should just buy index funds, but now I am not so sure.  A slightly more aggressive trading strategy could slightly increase your returns.",1273735090

If it gets you rooting around the balance sheets of publicly-traded companies, that has got to be a good thing for understanding how a company like Apple or Yahoo runs.  You should at least get a sense of why someone would pick a stock.  It's a great way to turn analytical interest into business knowledge.<p>And beating the averages picking stocks is not that different than doing so with a startup.  Startup founders, in aggregate, never outperform their opportunity cost.  Is that going to discourage you?  I really hope not.<p>Besides, when you learn about this kind of stuff, sometimes you happen upon gems like this:

The important prerequisite to this, though, would be to test kids both before <i>and</i> after each lesson, with tests of equivalent questions and equal difficulty—otherwise, you have no idea how much of their learning was because of the class, and how much they already knew.",1273734371

In any given 5 years, even fewer of them win.  In a study I saw a decade ago, across all such funds over the last few decades, only two had put in a performance that was unlikely under chance.<p>It was unlikely that anyone would have performed as well as Peter Lynch.  But not 99% unlikely.<p>Warren Buffett is clearly a statistical outlier.  However other things can be cited for his performance.  (Including his excellent management skills, and the fact that he every so often gets very lucrative opportunities that are not available to the market.  See, for instance, his sweetheart Goldman Sachs deal in 2008.)<p>This said, in defense of the mutual funds, most actually managed to outperform the market in the long run.  However the amount they outperformed by was less than their expenses for doing so.  So your employer is likely beating the market, but is failing to so so for their clients once they subtract your salary and their profit margin.<p>Incidentally the study that I saw excluded the performance of hedge funds.  This excludes some well-known long-term successes like George Soros.  The wide variety of strategies that they follow is just too hard to calibrate and do statistics with.  However on average it seems that they also lose to the market as a whole.  But with much larger volatility in their results.<p>As for your ""simplest options strategies"" there are plenty of option strategies, such as covered puts, that will increase your average returns at normal times, but deny you excessive returns when the market does strange things.  However a disproportionate fraction of long-term returns happen in sudden events that you will miss.  If options are correctly priced, in the long run you don't beat the market with any of them.<p>As for whether options are correctly priced, that is a matter for debate.  But I guarantee that the current market price of options has priced in the most widely accepted theories on how to correctly price options.",1273734231

You can certainly do &quot;most&quot; things with both but they will shine in different circumstances. You can certainly build anything with Rust, even an OS. And I guess this is where it will shine: system development, and very fast applications/tools.<p>Erlang/Elixir is made to build fault-tolerant applications: think a service (which is really tens of thousands of micro-services all running in the Erlang VM), distributed on a cluster, that needs to run 24/7 without any interruption ever. Upgrading the app should not halt the system. A bug somewhere should not require you to restart the app: it should be limited in scope and you just hot patch it away. Erlang is fault tolerance is fault tolerance.<p>From a Python/SQL background both will have a different set of challenges to learn: Erlang/Elixir means learning functional programming (no for loops, all map/reduce/filter and recursion), while Rust means learning how to handle references/memory ownership.<p>To build webservices I&#x27;d give an edge to Elixir: cowboy + plug (+ phoenix). But that should be fun to build with Rust too... You should learn both :)",1426820254

If it&#x27;s small then that&#x27;s OK.  Consider what would happen to you if it took three extra months to satisfy that first deliverable; you might wind up on the street.  But with more and smaller milestones, you at least have some money, even if you still underbid by three months.<p>Most of my experience has mostly been that a verbal agreement is completely cool, but I did get screwed a couple of times as a result.

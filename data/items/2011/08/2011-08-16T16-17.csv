Why we allow 18-year olds to blissfully sign up for a lifetime of crippling six-figure debt is beyond me.  At least make them get an engineering or business degree from a public college.  In-demand colleges can keep raising tuition because students will just get bigger loans to get the name on the degree.",1313513987

We have loads of students in school because they think they have to be, but don't treat it as an investment.

Heck, if we start running out of land to settle on on Earth, there's always the sea to settle, which requires many of the same engineering considerations to settle but at much lower cost to get us there and do trade with the rest of the planet.

Yes, between being smart and being lucky, being lucky is better.  Sadly, we can't order up luck on demand.  So, for an advantage we are stuck trying to be smart.<p>So, in trying to plan a successful startup, let's set aside luck.<p>Next, in trying to be worth, say, over $1 billion, we will be doing something quite rare.  So the fact:<p>""There are lots of people thinking aboutand probably working onthe same thing you are.""<p>is not very impressive, compelling, or convincing for our planning.<p>That is, for our rare, desired success, we should notice the advantage of the old advice to:<p>(1) Pick a problem without a good solution and where a good solution would be very valuable.  E.g., for a Web IT startup, provide something that hundreds of millions of people want and will like much better than anything else.  In a biomedical analogy, have a one pill (safe and effective) cure for cancer.<p>(2) Construct this product or service with an 'unfair advantage', that is, some crucial, core 'secret sauce' that is the key to providing something ""much better than anything else"".  In a biomedical analogy, use some work in biochemistry to construct a one pill cure for cancer.<p>(3) Have the 'secret sauce' be difficult to duplicate or equal.  In a biomedical analogy, use some powerful, difficult, original, advanced work in biochemistry to construct a one pill cure for cancer.<p>So, when following (1)-(3), is it fair to say:<p>""There are lots of people thinking aboutand probably working onthe same thing you are.""<p>HECK NO!<p>(A) Are (1)-(3) commonly pursued in IT?  No.<p>(B) Do (1)-(3) represent a major fraction of successful IT companies?  No.<p>Do (A)-(B) mean that (1)-(3) should be ignored?  NO!<p>Can (1)-(3) bring advantages?  Should be obvious that they can.<p>Remember:  The successful companies are heavily from luck, only a tiny fraction of startups can be worth over $1 billion, and the world keeps changing and moving on so that what most startups are doing and even what many successful startups did are not very good evidence for what to do to be worth over $1 billion!<p>There is one more hot button issue:  There is advice, say, from Steve Blank, that we have to keep going back to the customer to confirm that the customer will like the product or service.  But, for a safe, effective one pill cure for cancer, what do we ask the customer, what shape and color they want for the pill and what color they want on the pill bottle label?<p>So this importance of going back to the customer over and over means that the product or service being provided is less desirable than a one pill cure for cancer.<p>So, if possible, quit asking customers about what color they want in the pills and return to the work of constructing the one pill cure for cancer.<p>Can we get something like a one pill cure for cancer in IT?

(<a href=""http://individual.utoronto.ca/markfederman/article_mediumisthemessage.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://individual.utoronto.ca/markfederman/article_mediumist...</a>)<p>>>he tells us that a medium is ""any extension of ourselves."" Classically, he suggests that a hammer extends our arm and that the wheel extends our legs and feet. Each enables us to do more than our bodies could do on their own. Similarly, the medium of language extends our thoughts from within our mind out to others. Indeed, since our thoughts are the result of our individual sensory experience, speech is an ""outering"" of our senses - we could consider it as a form of reversing senses - whereas usually our senses bring the world into our minds, speech takes our sensorially-shaped minds out to the world.  But McLuhan always thought of a medium in the sense of a growing medium, like the fertile potting soil into which a seed is planted, or the agar in a Petri dish. In other words, a medium - this extension of our body or senses or mind - is anything from which a change emerges. And since some sort of change emerges from everything we conceive or create, all of our inventions, innovations, ideas and ideals are McLuhan media.",1313512582

Very likely, you will introduce a high performance middleware to prepare the data for rendering say in Java/C/C#. For the frontend, you have jQuery or whatever Javascript library you like.

2891787,comment,2889543,2889543,2,0,justinsb,,,"This benchmark is probably accurate, but not necessarily fair.  Here's why:<p>If all the systems have to do a table scan (complete scan of the data), then you're (almost always) I/O bound.  Because we're relying on sequential I/O, a good hard disk is as good as a consumer-grade SSD.  Postgresql doesn't do compression (if rows fit on a single page), and MySQL doesn't by default either (though you can enable InnoDB page compression), so if you're using compression with r17 you can get more rows per MB transferred, so you win.<p>However, this only works if you're doing table scans on highly compressible data.  The minute you compete against an index, I suspect you're going to lose heavily (e.g. selecting the number of hits by second over a one minute interval should be very fast on the relational databases, as they should be able to answer from the index)<p>MySQL and PostgreSQL are really OLTP databases, but you're running an OLAP workload here (multi-minute queries and table scans are essentially the definition of OLAP).  As you say, a comparison against Hadoop is probably more relevant (as long as you compress the data).  For this workload, an OLAP database is the tool to beat, and Hadoop is probably the leading contender in the open-source OLAP space.<p>Though I'd normally bet on PostgreSQL, I think the easiest fix is to turn on Innodb compression in MySQL: you should see query times that are much more comparable.  You'd probably still win (because MySQL is doing a lot more), but the margin should be much smaller.<p>I think it's also possible to denormalize your tables and improve your indexing, so that we can avoid table scans and then PostgreSQL/MySQL should be much faster, but I don't think this is really the point of your benchmark.<p>Edit: Just spotted a (much bigger) problem - if your data is 54GB raw, when compressed that should be within the memory size of your machine (12GB), but if MySQL and PostgreSQL aren't compressing their data won't fit into memory (particularly with all those unused indexes).  So in fact you're comparing RAM speeds to SSD speeds, which really isn't apples to apples.",1313512137

And since it's pretty undisputable that Apple is one of the most important companies in the world and such an <i>anamoly</i> in so many ways, I find it pretty important to read Gruber on the subject.<p>In fact, I often wish there was a writer with as aserbic a wit and as insightful an analytical mind on the subject of Google (Dan Lyons doesn't qualify, though fake Steve Jobs was pretty funny). Not for the apologia like this piece, but for when writers like Gruber, Marco, and especially John Siracusa are critical of their subject of obsession. The thing I love about Siracusa's podcast (Hypercritical) in particular is that you can really feel true, unadulterated, and unself-conscious devotion to the subject in the unchecked criticism he gives. And I wish that culture existed around Google.<p>There are plenty blogs that follow Google news in a sort of flat way (9to5google, GoogleOperatingSystem), and Danny Sullivan at SearchEngineLand provides analysis, but it's all on sort of a surface level.

Some have pointed out that solid module support is also important for fast community growth. In other words, I'm arguing for a dialect that centers around the compiler, doing evaluation as a side-effect, perhaps through JIT compilation.

I don't need you quoting random snippets at me (without linking to it) as if they contained actual information.<p>But tell you what, two can play at that game. I wrote a counter-FAQ a decade ago. I'll quote from that. :-)<p>> He's wrong on this simple matter of fact: the constitution says who contracted with whom.<p>(from <a href=""http://www.impel.com/liblib/NNLFAQ.html#9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.impel.com/liblib/NNLFAQ.html#9</a> )<p><i>What the constitution says regarding its own ratification procedure is essentially irrelevant to the argument that Spooner is making. Spooner's comments speak to the question of who this contract should be considered binding upon. Article VII is not overlooked, it is simply irrelevant to this question.<p>To illustrate: Suppose I wrote a document which I called the ""NNL Constitution"" that included the line, ""Glen Raphael hereby has the legal right to seize Mike Huben's television and automobile.""<p>In Article VII of this document I would write this: ""The ratification of the conventions of three Fiefdoms shall be sufficient for the establishment of this Constitution between the Fiefdoms so ratifying the same. Done in Convention, by the unanimous consent of the Fiefdoms present, the nineteenth day of January, in the year one thousand nine hundred and ninety-six. In Witness whereof, we have hereunto subscribed our names.""
[signatories FOR FIEFDOMS omitted.]<p>""I'd sign this as a representative of my fiefdom. I'd get a couple other libertarians to sign for the other two fiefdoms, one of which is defined to include Huben and his property. The head of the fiefdom having jurisdiction over Huben would have been duly chosen for that role in a ""popular vote"" that didn't happen to include Huben . Now, is the NNL a valid document with respect to Huben? The answer is clearly no. No matter what the document says, the people who signed that document didn't have his power of attorney so they have no ability to contract on his behalf. They can make binding contracts with each other but not with him, without his consent.</i><p>Googling up and regurgitating talking points made by people ""on your side"" is no substitute for thinking about what the person you're talking to is saying. If you want to see where Spooner is right or wrong, there's no substitute for reading Spooner. Reading Huben's dismissive take on Spooner is not going to make you more informed.<p>Just as one can't use what it says in the bible as evidence that we are bound by what the bible says, you can't use what it says in the constitution as evidence that we are bound by what the constitution says. It's a document. Anybody can write a document and make claims about it. The question is: are those claims reasonable and legally binding? Spooner had interesting things to say about this. Huben...not so much.<p>>By staying in the US as a US citizen you are continuing to re-up your contract. If you don't like this contract then you are free to emigrate.<p>Suppose I live in a bad neighborhood where my car regularly gets broken into or my apartment burgled. You could say that by staying in that neighborhood, I agree to a ""social contract"" that includes these sort of infrigements. And if I don't like it, I could move. That <i>is</i> the ""contract"" we have with the US - essentially the same one might have with a local mafiosa. The organization lets you keep your livelihood as long as you stay in line, under threat of force if you step out of line. Don't try to pretty it up.<p>It's not an <i>explicit</i> contract, it's an <i>implicit</i> one and it is coerced. The idea of a ""social contract"" is a theory about how consent <i>could</i> have been acquired in some society, but it's not relevant to any actual society - the governments we've got generally got in through terror and force and the populace tacitly putting-up-with-it. We ""consent"" because we don't want to go to jail, because we want to go along with the crowd, or because we don't see any other options. Not because our parents made some grand gesture they didn't even realize they were making. The random assortment of actions you say constitute signing a contract all have in common that they don't involve actually, you know, <i>signing a contract</i>.",1313511599

2891732,comment,2891032,2891032,1,0,briggsbio,,,"This is interesting, and might be possible.  The worry is that even if you have bullet-proof skin, your bones would break and internal organs be turned to mush.  but would it?<p>The name of the project is 2.6g 329m/s, after the mass and velocity of the bullet.<p>Using 1/2MV^2 to calculate the force, in Newtons (1):
=(1.2)(0.0026kg)(329m/s)^2
= 140.7 kg<i>m/s^2
= 140.7 N<p>Convert to foot</i>pounds (lbf): (2)
 1 N = 0.22481 lbf
140.7N (0.22481) = 31.6 lbf<p>So you body would have to dissipate 31.6 foot-pounds of force. Yes, it would loose some from friction mid-air, and your skin would dissipate some, but for the sake of argument, let's assume this is in a vacuum or some magical container, ceteris paribus. There's always the ""it only takes 8 pounds of force to break a bone"" but that's why you have soft tissue surrounding your bones. If it hit you in the head, you'd probably be screwed no matter what. I think this is more to be a replacement for body kevlar, not to wear as a batman cowl.<p>I once heard that a pro boxer can his with over 900 PSI, which would be about 30 lbf, but that's dissipated across a whole fist. Here's an article discussing that, it ranges widely (3). We need a better correlary.<p>So I continued to look and found a paper on bite force (4). It shows that a human can have a bite force of an average of 162 lbf. And specifically the incisors had a range of  22.5-33.7 lbf. That is roughly equivalent to the 31.6 lbf of a bullet. But what does this mean? A strong bite can ravage tissue, and a hollowpoint bullet would be a pretty sharp point and would likely slice right through the underlying tissue if it broke the skin (as it was designed to do).<p>I think it's important to look at other properties of the ""pseudoskin"" layer.  They used a small little patch on ballistics gel, and at the end of the video the patch was pushed into the gel and folded in on itself. So if you'd been wearing the patch and got shot it would be embedded 2 inches into your epidermis and underlying tissue (but at least it would be easy to pull the slug out!).<p>I would think we'd need to see more info on the shear-thickening properties of the gel, see what more than just a ""patch"" would do; say, ballistics gel with a complete outer layer of the pseudo-skin, and other properties.  The little patch has no way to grab onto the surrounding skin and provide tension to dissipate the force across the surface of the tissue (think like springs on a trampoline). And significant shear thickening would cause the pseudoskin to instantaneously harden with the force of the bullet, protecting the underlying real skin and tissue.<p>Need more info, but this could actually be promising.<p>(Note: Can someone check my calculations? I did them REALLY quickly. I can't confirm their reliability.)<p>Sources:

You can get any virtually any version of Android on this phone even none HTC roms, like the dell streak.

The fact some people ignore those points doesn't make them less valid. And it doesn't change the fact that a failure in government IT is 100 million pounds and private startup failure can range between just lost time to a few millions private/VC money: calculated risk (usually, I know there are exceptions like boo.com :)",1313510499

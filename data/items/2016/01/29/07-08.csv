10994048,comment,10993470,10993470,0,0,cyphar,,,"First of all, this is why people should stop adding stupid features to regular expressions. A sane regular expression implementation has <i></i>no<i></i> pathological cases. DFA generation can be done in O(n^2) from memory (in the absolute worst case O(n) is average), and matching can&#x27;t be worse than O(m) or similar (n is the size of the regex and m the size of the string). When you add features like back references and recursive matches, you bring the worst case complexity to O(a^n), which is exponential.<p>And why? So you could write some dirty hack rather than writing a simple recursive descent parser to create an AST of the code (which takes O(n)). What did you gain by ruining your regular expression implementation and writing shitty code?<p>EDIT: Matching <i>might</i> be O(m), but I&#x27;m wondering about maximally linked graphs with many epsilon edges. The conversion from DFA to NFA would require O(n^2) in that case. Implementing it as an NFA evaluation might be faster than full conversion, but then you run the risk of having O(n^2) dominating in the matching.<p>EDIT: The author is somewhat correct on what &quot;catastrophic back referencing&quot; is. While you could argue that it is due to bad implementations of the greedy matching, it&#x27;s a more endemic problem of how you have to implement a regular expression engine that supports back references. If you have to support back references, then you will always have a class of pathological cases which cause exponential time complexity. I had a useful graph about this on my toy regular expression engine (which performs much better than Python&#x27;s implementation even though it&#x27;s written in Python and not C): <a href=""https://github.com/cyphar/redone"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cyphar/redone</a>.",1454053860

The tests illustrate this [3].<p>2) Pass this all to a function (to be written) that prioritizes the inputs to be filled (top level inputs shown first, deeper ones maybe hidden in a disabled next step, etc.)  and generates a React UI.<p>3) Then once there is data in the system, introduce a notion of &quot;user focus&quot;, e.g. if a user clicks an existing entity, then the entity fields are passed to the function in 2) in addition to the available &quot;slots&quot; needed to continue building objects and the app will know to prioritize the inputs that have &quot;user focus&quot;.

So the pen-test team might have missed many stuff or identified all. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve seen in real world even the same members of the same pen-test team might find different issues for the same test.<p>Therefore one of the biggest problems is to actually knowing whether they are good or not at what they do. It&#x27;s easy to rate communication skills, responsiveness, attitude, report quality etc. But very hard to rate the quality of the results (which is the real reason for carrying out a pen-test).<p>When they don&#x27;t find something, maybe there really is nothing there.\nWhen they found something, maybe there is more there. The customer has no idea at that point. It&#x27;ll be only a fair amount of time later they&#x27;ll figure out the coverage / vulnerability finding quality.<p>I&#x27;m sure in the long run market will stabilize (assuming you can change your rating for a pen-tester even after a year) but this is something to consider.<p>Update: BTW personally I don&#x27;t like the idea of logging in via LinkedIn (for finding a security talent), it&#x27;s feels too intrusive, beside of the personal preference my experience showed me especially security industry don&#x27;t like SSO style things.",1454053167

Our education system is based on the gut instinct of certain administrators. People who clearly would prefer a structured system where one-size-fits-all. Not that I&#x27;m saying everyone learns differently (learning styles are also mostly bullshit), I&#x27;m saying that the current system could be much better and people who do well in the current system are very motivated to do well and will gladly push with all of their force through the bullshit so they can get on with their lives.",1454053132

This isn&#x27;t a technical decision more a question of OPSEC policy. The key to anonymity is compartmentalization - the concept of creating, maintaining and then isolating your different identities.<p>Your real identity will continue to use your computer, your phone number, your internet connection, etc. It might tighten up some privacy leaks. Your anonymous identity (which may have a name) will use Tor in a virtual machine as a gateway and Linux in another virtual machine as a client, or it will boot into Tails. The anonymous identity using Tor has nothing in common with the real identity that can be linked together by a passive or active attacker.<p>For ex. your anon identity is doing anonymous stuff on anonymous online markets, but then you use the same Tails session to login to your personal Gmail. You&#x27;ve just been de-anonymized. Don&#x27;t share anything between the two identities (having the same interests, typing style, etc. to name a few) as that would tie an anonymous identity to a real one.<p>With this in mind, Tails is perfect for the use case of &#x27;I need to do some anonymous stuff with my anonymous identity and then get back&#x27; which is exactly how a lot of journalists, black hats, etc. use it. The more &#x27;comfortable&#x27; Tails is with features and programs the more likely you are to hang around and do something that will de-anonymize you :)",1454051883

But aside all my admiration for all their achievements - all beyond my abilities - let me ask you, hackers of the world, is this what we really want, if/when we build something so awesome?

Oh, and don&#x27;t forget to add in time for testing it, too.<p>This may change if Valve can make the Steam Box happen, but right now it sure doesn&#x27;t sound like a sound business decision to bother looking for those last few extra bucks from Tux. Honestly I&#x27;m surprised anyone releases <i>anything</i> for Linux or for Macs now that I look at the numbers; I suspect we have the rise of cross-platform general-purpose game engines (which this game doesn&#x27;t rely on) to thank for that.",1454050817

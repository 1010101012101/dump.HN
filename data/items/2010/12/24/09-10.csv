2036991,comment,2036864,2036974,0,0,philwelch,,,"It's an interesting and complicated question. If you look at the graph, the derivative of the incarceration rate actually peaks around 1990, which is still pre-three-strikes. And in retrospect, three-strikes laws wouldn't have increased the incarceration rate very much because someone convicted of three felonies is presumably someone who would have a high frequency of imprisonment anyway, and rounding that frequency to 1 wouldn't have as great an effect. (If you're in and out of prison frequently enough, enough that you're in prison 80% of the time, sentencing you to life only increases the prison population by 0.2 of a person by aggregate.)<p>Although, come to think of it, that might be the answer--a lot of the criminals we first imprisoned in the 70's ended up being recidivists, and cracking down on recidivism in the 90's through longer sentences and three strikes laws decreased crime when the recidivists ended up staying in prison, rather than leaving prison to commit more crimes every few years.<p>The sad part is, this might even apply to people who were unjustly imprisoned for drugs. Someone in prison on drug charges is going to be more likely to get involved in gangs while in prison, and hence become a more dangerous criminal when let out.",1293184779

So there is no guarantee that any nicely engineered utopia won't become warped after a while -- if anything, human history pretty much guarantees that it will.<p>Human society can't be engineered, it's a living mechanism, and in the past millennia we've been through pretty much all we could (although that heavily depends on technological advances, such as communications and the like). So far, we can safely say that there are two extreme forms of society when it comes to laws: a totalitarian state, where a small group of people keep the rest in control, and a total anarchy, where there are no set laws and rules. At each point in time, any society is at some point between those two extremes, and the larger the society it's more probable that different rules apply to various subdivisions within it.<p>So no, it is not possible to set up an ideal society (of any form, libertarian or socialist or whatever) and keep it such for a long time -- unless perhaps for very small, heavily regulated and closed groups, isolated from the rest of society which tolerates them (as is often the case with religious cults and small but wealthy totalitarian countries).",1293183783

2036971,comment,2036582,2036909,0,0,zeemonkee,,,"There need not be a major global event for English to lose its status. There are a number of possible scenarios, which may take centuries or millennia. For example, Latin persisted as the language of the church and academia centuries after the collapse of the Roman Empire - if the US were to collapse tomorrow (however unlikely) English will likely persist out of convenience for a while.<p>It need not even be a collapse - sometimes languages can be adopted for other reasons. For example, upper class Romans spoke Greek (the language of a conquered people), upper class Russians in the 19th century spoke French (if you read War and Peace, it's strange to see so much French dialogue - when the French were the enemy !). Could it be possible that perhaps a century hence, upper class Americans use Chinese among themselves and English to speak to the peasants ?<p>A more likely scenario is fragmentation into new languages - just as Latin broke up into French, Spanish etc. Often this happens with the influence of local languages. While a collapse in global communications - due to war, resource depletion, or other disaster - would accelerate the process, it can still happen over a longer period of time.<p>Another new possibility is that advances in technology render the concept of a lingua franca obsolete - a ""universal translator"". This is unlikely without some major advances in AI but not impossible.",1293183423

I remember being very good at it at the time.<p>Then I started to do quite a bit of sys admin work along with Perl and web scripting during the dotcom days and switched to Vi as I found it much quicker to use when doing sys admin tasks and Perl was quite simple as well.<p>Then I started to do enterprise Java development. I call these my 'dark years'. Eclipse, IntelliJ and others but with Vi keybindings if I could find plugins for them (search and replace in Vi is great...love just hitting the '/' and beginning to type.)<p>Then I started to do some Erlang and Clojure and I Vi wasn't cutting it anymore. So I started to use Emacs again (this is about 12 years later at this point, btw) and realized I didn't remember anything. So I grabbed Emacs Start Kit on github, forked it and started to hack up an environment I felt comfortable in. Slowly It has been coming back to me, but in the time since I was out of Emacs there have been some good advancements.<p>At this point, I think I have the best of both worlds in that I know Vi(m) pretty well, have a really good .vimrc that I like and I also have an ability to use Emacs for non-trivial tasks and feel I'll be able to really use it in about 3 more months of steady use. The weirdest thing is trying to hit escape (or 'jj' as I've remapped it) in Emacs...<p>All in all, I think I will end up preferring Emacs for non-trivial tasks and still use Vim for basic text editing or sys admin tasks.<p>I do like both for their various strong points, but at the same time I have to say that both are quite annoying in other ways.

But if we did that, the crime rate would be different because, presumably, at least some of those people would have gone on to commit crimes!<p>I'll readily concede that at least half, maybe 60% of the US prison population is only locked up for drug offenses, and that legalizing drugs by the end of this week won't affect the rates of other crimes[1]. 84% seems high.<p>[1] I couldn't easily find any good breakdown of what all these people are imprisoned for, and would appreciate it. That said, as much I'm in favor of drug legalization, drug possession and sale is still a crime, and it's also a crime in nearly every other country you're comparing crime rates to.",1293181543

Key escrow never went anywhere.<p>It's not clear to me that the various government have the encryption keys to most encrypted communication - in particular, my understanding with BES (Kurzwell uses RIM key access as a justification of his ""Correct"") is that encryption is done on the Company's server, and decrypted on the end device.  No government access to the keys.<p>Kurzwell goes on to talk about the ""additional layer of virtually unbreakable encryption codes with no third party keys."" in #11, but the two predictions, #10 and #11 are somewhat at odds to each other.  He's trying to have his cake and eat it as well.  ""Almost everything is encrypted with keys that are available to the government except for that data which is encrypted with keys not available to the government"".   He was looking at the trends in clipper chip and made a partially incorrect prediction.  He should just admit it - no shame in missing this one - he's still ""Essentially correct""",1293181308

My point was that if you want to (unpatriotically) give up on your country instead of trying to improve it, and you're rich, and you ignore language and culture (like the seasteading idea does), you have many other countries to pick from.<p>Now if out of all the other countries in the world you can't find one that's even close to your ideals maybe there is a reason for that, maybe your utopia is not possible.  Thiel as a CEO got to tell people what to do, he seems to have this idea that he will setup his government and people will just follow his rules.  So I guess he's thinking of being some kind of benevolent dictator.  In some other of his social writing* he has said he doesn't believe in democracy anymore.  But even in a dictatorship you have to get consent from at least your security.<p>In his effort to escape politics he doesn't seem to realize that politics is what happens when you get a lot of people together making decisions.  What happens when charismatic socialist or conservatives leaders rise up in his country?  What happens when special interests start competing with each other?<p>If he were somehow able to solve the technical, economical, security and legal issues the whole thing would just devolve into the same political mess that every society goes through.  How do I know?  Because that's what happens everytime a government has been formed, it's what's happened to every single other country in the world.<p>* <a href=""http://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/the-education-of-a-libertarian/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/the-educa...</a>",1293181253

Thus the process getting into, say, Vancouver or Toronto is somewhat different than getting Montreal - French is far more important, as is being young, or having children.  Some countries, such as the US and some South American ones, have reciprocity arrangement where you can enter with a CV and a job offer.  Others, such as European ones, can take 4+ months and require a bit of &quot;paperwork gymnastics&quot; to pull it off.  And there are quotas and categories which have appeared and disappeared over the recent past.<p>As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s way easier than dealing with the US although one must be &quot;careful and correct&quot; when doing the paperwork.",1407722286

Far from being a &quot;hit piece&quot; against the A380, the article appeared to me to be a simple-enough exposition of two major airline manufacturers taking different gambles about the future of aviation. Would this story only be accurate if it were published by Le Monde or Der Spiegel?<p>To return to your point, the whole point to Boeing&#x27;s 787 development was to compete with &quot;longer-range international&quot; routes... at such a long range, in fact, that two cities could be directly connected instead of requiring the spoke-and-hub model that the A380 is optimized for. And in any event, U.S. carriers do indeed run long range international routes that would theoretically be up the A380&#x27;s alley, but the problem is as you state: &quot;you&#x27;d never fill THAT many seats&quot; to make A380 profitable for U.S. airlines (as the NYT articles states, these airlines returned to profitability by <i>reducing</i> excess capacity).",1407721519

Its 100+ person tech team has created world-class systems for analytics, advertising, and content management. Engineers are 1st class citizens. Everything is built for mobile devices from the outset. Internet native formats like lists, tweets, pins, animated GIFs, etc. are treated as equals to older formats like photos, videos, and long form essays. BuzzFeed takes the internet and computer science seriously.</i><p>The last line, about taking &quot;computer science seriously&quot;...maybe BF doesn&#x27;t have a dev team of the likes of Google and Facebook, but it must certainly be one of the best in the media business. I&#x27;ve looked through their job postings from time to time, and unlike most major media companies, the job descriptions treat engineering/dev positions as the complex, specialized fields that they often are...what I mean is that at a news company, a dev is expected to do many different things...not because the news company really wants a &quot;full stack&quot; developer or will pay the salary for what that entails, but because there are so many legacy technologies to juggle, and since the traditional news company has only so much money to spend on tech...a Java developer could be expected to crank on the CMS and also figure out video delivery solutions for the media company&#x27;s bespoke legacy system...and maybe also do some front-end design. At BuzzFeed, even though it seems the organization is relatively flat, with not many layers/walls between tech and editorial, when they want a MySQL developer, they just want someone who can do some serious administration and performance hacking...not a MySQL dev who also might also be expected to hack on some animal quiz code.<p>I think besides the quality of their CMS (which is pretty damn good, no matter what you think of the editorial content)...one of their most impressive feats was rebuilding the entire site, basically from scratch, during the week that Hurricane Sandy flooded their servers in lower Manhattan. In fact, I believe Gawker had their servers in the same area, but was reduced to creating a Tumblr and posting to it for some time after the hurricane.<p>edit: Also, another thing I admire: despite their technological chops, they tend to be fairly conservative about how they push the constraints of the web. Their lists are simply lists that work in any browser, any device...because text and static images <i>work perfectly fine</i> in conveying a message. Even their gigantic longform stories don&#x27;t do crazy shit...for being a &quot;gimmicky&quot; tabloidesque site, BuzzFeed seems to have great confidence in the power of plaintext and big photos...compare this to major news organizations trying to parallax-scroll everything for every occasion.",1407720415

8161469,comment,8160669,8160669,6,0,bane,,,"Honda is fascinating to me. Making among the most consistently reliable cars, at least according to every consumer survey I&#x27;ve ever seen. Their cars are relatively no-frills, they usually seem to trail any technology trends in the industry by a generation or two. They&#x27;re kind of the Nintendo of the car world. Never first, generally or always profitable, even when they look like they&#x27;re down.<p>They&#x27;re basically the automotive embodiment of Gunpei Yokoi&#x27;s &quot;Lateral Thinking of Withered Technology&quot;.<p>At least in the part of the world where I live, I can absolutely guarantee that at any given stoplight, there will be at <i>least</i> 1 Honda vehicle. They&#x27;re absolutely ubiquitous here. Honda buyers are also among the highest percentage of returning customers...because their last car gave them something like 20 years of trouble free, reasonable cost driving. They&#x27;re profitable even though they&#x27;re in 2 of the most competitive and lowest average profit automotive segments in the world and their products last <i>forever</i>.<p>Yet there&#x27;s some unusual things going on with Honda that I think is worth paying attention to:<p>- I&#x27;m frequently surprised, when I leave my local bubble, how few Hondas I see. I remember first noticing it during a few travels to the midwest. At any given stoplight, I could guarantee I <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> see a Honda. I&#x27;d definitely see an American brands and usually a Toyota. These days I see a surprising number of Hyundais, but outside of what seems to be fairly particular parts of the U.S. Honda vehicles just don&#x27;t seem to be that common.<p>- I&#x27;m even more surprised when overseas how slim the Honda pickings are. I think in a couple-three weeks in London I may have seen 3 Eurostyle civics. Reading UK reviews the reviewers seem so...tepid on the vehicles. Comparing them often unfavorable to notoriously unreliable VW and even worse, Peugeot and Citroën, which are among the few automakers to make Ferraris and Jaguars look like reliable automotive appliances. I&#x27;d say this says that UK buyers don&#x27;t really value reliability, but reviews of UK Fords are full of &quot;if you want a reliable car, this is a good car to get&quot;...which is odd, since Fords, while probably more reliable than <i>most</i> European cars, are not terribly reliable in comparison to Japanese cars (there about as good as Korean cars are these days).<p>- In Continental Europe I can&#x27;t remember seeing more then 1, despite months all over. In Korea, the American spec Accord was about as popular as a Japanese car can be. But I&#x27;ve seen more Landrovers in Korea that Hondas.<p>- On the flip side, their Japanese rival Toyota, is just about everywhere. The Hilux is especially ubiquitous in harsher climates. I even owned one for a bit (they&#x27;re not nearly as indestructible as Top Gear makes them appear) and it was fine.<p>- Honda runs a surprisingly public and aggressive R&D program. Everything from fuel cells to humanoid robots. The first in-car navigation system ever was made by Honda. But they seem to take <i>forever</i> before they trickle this tech into their cars. The moment of commercialization for them seems to be a generation or two after everybody else is doing it.<p>All of these things make me think Honda still has huge growth potential. If consumers start to value what Honda is offering, they could easily be a #1 or #2 in the world maker. As it is, consumer simply value other things (big engines, styling, name cachet, whatever).<p>I think Honda takes an unusually measured approach in the industry. The last couple generations seem strangely out of character. I&#x27;ve got this down to two events:<p>1. The rise of Korean cars. The weird stylish Accord and Civic from that period, with their bizarre button filled, non-ergonomic dashes.<p>2. Fukushima. The Honda generation from that period are <i>almost</i> a return to form, but they seem oddly unfocused in design.<p>However, but golly if the current generation seems like Honda back in form. Boring, reasonably prices, unbelievably reliable appliances you ride in reasonable comfort from a->b.",1407720251

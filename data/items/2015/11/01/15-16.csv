I highly doubt that the two firms dominating the industry are themselves politically connected. Government officials protecting an industry is categorically not corruption, protecting individual firms and giving them a leg up over other firms in the same industry categorically is.<p>Propping up an industry is called subsidization and it&#x27;s part and parcel of how modern governments manage the economy.<p>Second, whether they should be blocking it or not is not a settled question. Gambling is weird, it can&#x27;t really be called good or bad, like any vice, in moderation it&#x27;s fine for people. And it&#x27;s arguable whether fantasy football is actually gambling. Also we lost the ability to regulate real gambling when the big online poker companies fled the country and set up shop overseas. Seems like there would be nothing keeping this niche from doing that either.",1446393430

Instead, you simply pick a party for which to vote. I believe the only rational choice is to say &quot;Give me one ballot for each party,&quot; which gives close-to-stacked-rank voting for the primary.<p>I still show up for the primaries, as I want the chance to choose who I vote for when I get to the general election. However, such a system makes it impossible for me to consider political office (beyond school board) as my primary declaration is a matter of public record, meaning that I would not pass any test of party purity.<p>What I really want is stacked-rank voting in the primaries and in the general election.

The recognized value someone brings is unfortunately often very much dependent on their geographic location.<p>Since you&#x27;re not native to the US (apologies if you are), I think you should understand that the US is a big place. Even many of the states are huge. Even many huge cities like Los Angeles can have dramatically different cost of living expenses depending on the area. Someone living in Alabama, even in a nice city in a nice area is going to have a much lower cost of living than someone in the Los Angeles area. So making more than 90% of the country seems like it&#x27;s saying a lot but it really isn&#x27;t.<p>If this were simply a case of a normal employee at a mid-to-large corp it would be a completely different question. And even though this isn&#x27;t the case his compensation and shares may be more than enough. I&#x27;m not arguing that it is or isn&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m simply pointing out two things: 1) That even if this was a normal &quot;established company hires an employee&quot; relationship where a someone making 25K in a different country is comparing apples to oranges. 2) A very early employee can be the difference between success and failure for a startup. Even more so if there are two founders and only one is technical. They want to feel respected for their contribution and compensated accordingly. 165K plus 3% might be more than enough. But that compensation package has nothing to do with the rest of the country or the world. Period. It&#x27;s another apples-to-oranges comparison.",1446393267

10486722,comment,10480390,10486505,0,0,harryh,,,"> If I put a market order to sell meat at the market price of 10$ at 10AM<p>Yes, at 10AM (before news happens) you can take the $10 price. And, unfortunately for you, the world might change 1 microsecond later. And it sounds bad when you say &quot;1 microsecond&quot; but what if you say &quot;5 minutes&quot; or &quot;1 hour&quot; or &quot;1 day&quot;? You&#x27;re probably going to feel just as bad about missing out on a better price even if the timescale is a human one instead of an electronic one.<p>There is no way to avoid this. The world can change after your sell your meat. It might change 1 microsecond later or it might change a week later. You chose to sell when you chose to sell. You can&#x27;t say oopsies and complain if the world changes after you made your decision. The fact that the world can change after you make your trade has absolutely nothing to do with high speed trading.<p>Very high speed price discovery actually works in your favor here! At least the price jumps to $20 really really fast after the news now. Without computers it might take 5 or 10 minutes (or whatever). The sooner the news is incorporated the smaller the time window in which you can accidentally screw yourself.<p>While thinking about this, keep in mind also that the price might drop (maybe there is a bumper crop of cows). If you sold now for $10 but then the price dropped to $5 you&#x27;d feel great. When you sell now you&#x27;re taking the risk of a price change (in either direction) off the table. You can&#x27;t on one hand, avoid a price drop, but on the other hand think that you should get the benefits of a price rise.<p>> the first HFT to get the news of the catastrophe at 10AM + 1 microsecond will buy them from me at that price,<p>This is actually wrong and not what happens. The trade you&#x27;re talking about happened at 10AM (before the news). You put in a market order which means &quot;take whatever price is being offered right now.&quot; not &quot;put my meat out for sale and wait for someone else to trade with me.&quot;<p>So no trade is happening at 10AM + 1 microsecond (after the news).<p>> If trades were only allowed every 60 seconds like the comic suggests<p>Ah yes. Everyone eventually hits on this idea, but it doesn&#x27;t work. What happens if, at a given price, the # of buyers and sellers doesn&#x27;t match up at the time you want to execute all the trades?<p>1. Execute the trades that put in their orders first. Well then you&#x27;re back to where you were before.<p>2. Execute some % (less than 100%) of one side of the trades so that everything matches up. But then you create a very unstable situation. If I think that maybe only 50% of the trades are going to execute you&#x27;ve incentivized me to say I want to trade 2x of what I really want to trade. But wait, everyone else is also thinking the same thing. So maybe 4x? Repeat ad nauseam. This is a very unstable game-theory heavy sort of situation that&#x27;s actually pretty dangerous.<p>And really even if you do this you haven&#x27;t removed the need for high speed computers & communication. Lets say that a block closes at precisely noon. I definitely don&#x27;t want to input my trade at 11:59:01. What if there is news in the next 59 seconds? I really want to wait until the last possible microsecond to input my trades for the block right? So...we&#x27;re back to where we were before anyways.<p>The real world is continuous. It&#x27;s not really possible to make markets based on the real world operate discretely.",1446392555

10486714,comment,10485442,10485442,0,0,rayiner,,,"The article implies that Evanston is an archetypal suburb, but that&#x27;s misleading. Both the Metra (Chicago&#x27;s commuter rail system) and the El (the subway) have stops in Evanston. Metra trains leave every 15 minutes during the morning rush hour and get you to the Loop in under 30. Pre-car era suburbs radiate out from cities like Chicago and New York, connected to their core cities via rail infrastructure built a century ago. They have long-had appropriately-zoned downtowns to facilitate mixed residential/commercial development close to transit.<p>Most suburbs in the U.S. are entirely unlike Evanston. They have little to no rail infrastructure. Even when they do, the area around the rail stations is inappropriately zoned. For example, the new stops on D.C.&#x27;s Silver Line will require decades of aggressive redevelopment before they are comparable to the walkable commuter suburbs of Chicago or New York. The Tysons Corner metro station is in the median of a giant highway with 4-lanes in each direction. There is a single high-rise apartment building within a convenient walk, and even that requires traversing huge un-pedestrian-scale skybridges over the highway.<p>E.g. here is the area around the Scarsdale commuter line (a town in Westchester County, NY): <a href=""https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/46/96/3b/46963b6010c546765e6a226ec40f18bd.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/46/96/3b/46963b601...</a>.<p>Here is the area around the Mclean metro station (a similar suburb in Fairfax County, NY): <a href=""http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/mclean-metro-station-tysons-corner-new-va-44716665.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/mclean-metro-station-tysons-c...</a>.",1446392474

That is often <i>not</i> the case. Let&#x27;s explore IRC now.<p>* Integration has never been a problem ... build bots.<p>I feel silly and naive, should I know how to set this up? Maybe it is really easy and well documented, and I am an edge case here, but i don&#x27;t know how to do this. I clicked 3 buttons to setup github for slack. It was very easy and I didn&#x27;t haystack through building a solution to something that exists. Scope creep on tooling is dangerous as an aside. Thos takes that off the table.<p>* persistence<p>again, I have to set up an alternate tool to download the content. i assume this would backup the whole channel so any user could reference it, but it comes by default for free with slack. if each user must have a seperate tool, or go to a seperate place to see a conversation (which may be less searchable) it adds friction.<p>* code snippets<p>actually super reasonable to use pastebin. slack is at least as annoying for code as pastebin, if not more.<p>* etc<p>The point is, not everyone lnows as much as the author about IRC who is likely quite a talented developer who grew up on it. An 18 year old likely won&#x27;t have used irc as much as older generations given the plethora of tools and chat clients.<p>FOSS is a choice and a philosophy and that should be given some degree of consideration.

The biggest lessons were teamwork and sacrifice. Football is unique in that it&#x27;s the only sport in which all 11 players on the field have to all do their job at the same time or you lose. In every other sport, a single star or two can dominate the entire game and win for the entire team. In football, the quarterback gets his ass kicked if all 5 of his linemen don&#x27;t block. A star linebacker can stop the run and short passes (if the defensive linemen do their job), but can&#x27;t do anything for the sweep or long pass.<p>Football is also a good way to teach strategy. Unlike other sports where plays are limited due to the ongoing, chaotic nature of most sports, football stops after every play. You can sweep, pass, run up the middle, screen, option, etc. There are lots of options that may or may not work from one team to the next. You have to take a lot into account when coming up with a game plan, including the specific team you&#x27;re playing. It&#x27;s why coaches are so obsessive about going over game tapes. As my coach liked to point out, football is the only sport where you need an entire week to prepare between games.<p>And before everybody jumps on me about &#x27;you can learn these lessons elsewhere/through video games&#x27;, yes, they probably can. That doesn&#x27;t negate the benefits kids get from playing football. I won&#x27;t mention the health benefits you get because you get those from playing (just about) any sport.<p>Also, a funny anecdote, I only played 2 years of high school football before bailing. I played for 6 years for an independent organization called &#x27;Pop Warner Football&#x27;. My coach for pop warner was an entrepreneur who owned and ran three concrete companies in three separate counties. He coached only because his son was playing. My high school coach had no idea what he was doing, which is why I didn&#x27;t play my senior year.<p>If high school football got banned, I imagine Pop Warner will step in and pick up the slack, if they haven&#x27;t already. Back when I stopped playing in the 90&#x27;s, they had already expanded their program to compete with the Junior Varsity program. That&#x27;s what I mean about football having too much support in the community. If the insurance premiums and lawsuits increase, they&#x27;ll just have another bake sale.",1446392319

FINCEN has been developing this type of technology for decades.<p>And this is magnified when you&#x27;re talking about essentially penny transactions - unless your cash bitcoin dealer is willing to see you every week for another $2.<p>&quot;Anonymity&quot; means little in the context of ecash.

Off-the top of my head: AutoCAD, Revit, Inventor, 3ds Max, Maya, to name a few.<p>In the media-and-entertainment space, there is a strong trend towards Python as the de-facto scripting language. The list of 3D products used in games that support Python is too long to list. I still see a lot of usage of C# in games houses.<p>Some older languages do have their own custom language (e.g. Maya has MEL, 3ds Max has MAXScript, AutoCAD had AutoLisp).<p>I&#x27;m not sure if MCG will ever be a lingua franca for 3d but I&#x27;d love it if I could make that happen. I&#x27;ve tried to keep it relatively decoupled from the implementation technology (even though I map to .NET for now).<p>It would be relatively easy for someone to reverse engineer the graph format (XML files) and map it to a dynamic language like JavaScript or Python. The only challenge is mapping the core set of operators to the host language.",1446390047

Wages are set* by the department of labor but the data is very inconsistent which means you can hire someone as a level 4 software engineer with a market salary of 130k or you can hire her as a level 1 systems analyst at 65k... which do you think the employer picks?

There&#x27;s a vast array of topics in CS that aren&#x27;t encountered in 95% of typical programming tasks.  Then you&#x27;ve got the greater efficiency of learning when you learn things directly and can interact mentors and other students.  No book or tutorial will have all the details down like a human that understands something.  Then there is the crafting of a holistic program that ensures students get exposed to the right topics in the right order, building a strong theoretical basis.  Also, more advanced or cutting edge topics are not going to be well documented so the academic world is a great place to get exposure.  Also, you don&#x27;t have career pressure to meet business goals so you can focus on learning.  Also, the time structure and social environment helps with people that aren&#x27;t completely self driven yet (the majority of young adults?).

(Already the UWP Facebook app, as one example, is a leap forward in cross-OS feature parity compared to previous versions and it will be great to see that &quot;day one&quot; on Windows 10 phones.) On top of that you have &quot;Project Astoria&quot; which will mean <i>very</i> easy ports of existing Android apps to Windows 10 Phones for developers looking to leverage existing code investment.

They&#x27;re probably doing the best they can with a bad situation.<p>I don&#x27;t know how you come to this conclusion from the data you&#x27;re citing.<p>You seem to be claiming that LEOs kill more people because more people attack LEOs with guns; i.e. you&#x27;re arguing that LEOs kill more people in self-defense. But you&#x27;re far from proving that point.<p>In fact, the easiest way to prove this point would be to have data on police shootings: if every officer had body-cam footage of every time they fired in self-defense, your argument would be proven. Yet the majority of police officers are resistant to wearing body cams. If LEOs are really firing in defense of self or others, why are they so opposed to proving it?<p>One could make the opposite argument: that people who use guns against LEOs are doing so in self-defense. The fuck-the-police attitude is equally explained by this: if the police are murdering your fathers, brothers, and friends, <i>of course</i> you&#x27;re going to thing &quot;fuck the police&quot;. And this would explain why LEOs in the US are so resistant to body cams: if they are the aggressors in these situations, then they aren&#x27;t going to want footage showing their crimes.<p>I think that the evidence better supports the latter argument. But of course, we&#x27;re short on evidence: we&#x27;re a long way from proving <i>either</i> point. This is why we need more evidence.

10355081,comment,10351949,10352424,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"> GraphQL is an ORM for rest apis<p>No, GraphQL is a protocol that replaces REST.<p>Its closest analogue is the unholy beast that is SOAP + WSDL, except without the insanity of XML. With SOAP/WSDL you declare a schema for your API, which then accepts API calls containing parameters. SOAP/WSDL follows a classical RPC paradigm where you execute functions that take positional arguments.<p>GraphQL dispenses with that terminology, but is still very much RPCish. A key difference is that &quot;arguments&quot; are keyword-based. Where SOAP/WSDL would have you pass a &quot;complex type&quot; (ie., a struct) with optional fields, in GraphQL everything is built out of structs. Another key difference is that the output follows the structure of the input.<p>GraphQL remaps REST&#x27;s paths to nested keys. For example, given the routes:<p><pre><code>  /books\n  /books/:id\n  /books/:id/authors\n</code></pre>\nThis becomes:<p><pre><code>  query {\n    book(id: ...) {\n      authors\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nWhere REST doesn&#x27;t help you is when you want to be able to filter on a lot of things — either your API becomes an explosion of all permutations of relationships, or you do (as many do) create a &quot;query API&quot; that takes all sorts of criteria as inputs. For example: When you get a books&#x27; authors you might want to filter by editors only. Or you want to find all books written by an author that were published in the 1950s. REST also doesn&#x27;t help the client pick which fields to include, or which relationships to follow. Sure, you can implement it on top of REST, but any such solution becomes ad-hoc and app-specific.<p>Part of that is, firstly, because REST is a set of rules, not a complete protocol, and secondly, REST wants to deal with resources, not queries. Queries (ie., POST to some collection) are left as an exercise for the reader.<p>Coincidentally, there is no reason why you can&#x27;t encode GraphQL queries as GET URLs via paths:<p><pre><code>  /books/id=1/year=1950..1959/authors/name=~John\n</code></pre>\nThis probably violates the tenets of REST, which says that resource URLs should uniquely identify a resource. I forget what REST says, if anything, about &quot;views&quot; into resources.",1444329961

I was born in the Soviet Union and had to read the biography and the history of the Cuban revolution (the soviet version of it, at least). One would think, that having been blessed to be born in a communist country, I&#x27;d reap all of its benefits. But surprisingly, it wasn&#x27;t the capitalist imperialists, who have sent my great grandparents to a prison camp in Siberia never to be seen again just for owning a cow. And surprisingly, it wasn&#x27;t the dastardly capitalist imperialists, who have murdered 7 million of my compatriots through an induced, and surprisingly very geographically concentrated famine. One would think that grain is transportable, but there you go: apparently not. No, it was the benevolent communists.<p>But you know what? There&#x27;s this country called Guatemala, that for 10 years was kind of doing OK, and was a liberal capitalist society. But let&#x27;s call it communist for the sake of the argument. They tried confiscating (not buying out, but straight out taking away) property from a very powerful player, after which the capitalist imperialist player started arming and training 500 men and telling fibs about the president on the radio. The 500 men failed militarily, but the army decided to surrender anyway. All of that cannot of course be evidence of a deeply embedded social instability and political apathy, but clearly shows that democracy doesn&#x27;t work. We weren&#x27;t talking about democracy at all, but there you go. So, yeah, if you disregard all of the above, we super-duper promise that Guatemala could have become a communist utopia. This &quot;could&#x27;ve&quot; of course invalidates all the deaths and misery communism inflicted upon the world in the extremely short period of time it existed, and proves beyond a shadow of a doubt, that it isn&#x27;t related to the endemic abuse of power and corruption that seems to follow it all the time, and totally works. We promise. Especially when it allows western people, who have never stood in a 3 km long line for toilet paper and have never gone hungry in the 20th century to feel morally superior by accepting 1st-world-guilt, yet being able to absolve oneself from any moral responsibility by shifting the blame to a cabal of disembodied corporations.<p>/s",1444329873

What I dislike is an unknown potential loss that I can&#x27;t readily account for.<p>For example - if I invest $50k I need to account for the possibility I might lose the entire $50k, or a portion of it. Being realistic, I&#x27;m unlikely to lose it all, but even if I only lose $5,000 that puts me off from making that investment. It&#x27;s very risk-averse behavior, which many people with a confirmation bias are against. Their $50k investment may have returned $150k and they begin to question why I wouldn&#x27;t make that investment.<p>In other words, even if 3/5 people make $150k, as a risk-averse person, I see myself as already being part of the 2/5 people that lose the $5,000.<p>The only forms of investments I&#x27;ve ever done are playing the markets on MMORPG&#x27;s.

But the more you threaten to &#x27;civilize&#x27; by force, the more intransigent people will be about giving up their firearms.<p>> You don&#x27;t. You&#x27;re not going to rise up against the government, and you&#x27;re not going to need it to protect your family.<p>If the government decided to try to confiscate firearms by force people probably would fight it tooth and nail.  Luckily that kind of rhetoric is not prevalent, but it is exactly the fear of state-sponsored violence that many ardent gun owners are afraid of.  Some of those people may seem irrational and paranoid, but just looking at the 20th century, somewhere around 100 million civilians were murdered in state-sponsored killings.  State-sponsored mass murder is almost exclusively visited upon unarmed populaces.",1444329631

Per the comment, please read my other post which provides a good primer on high level detail and perhaps do some research on Engineered Materials vs Monolithic Materials.<p>I&#x27;ll also provide a bit more detail here:\nMonolithic materials, such as ordinary metals or plastics are substantially the same in all directions.  You can work with them by getting the basic info on their properties, and then design and cut them from any direction.  Other than edge cases pushing the limits where you have to watch for grain effects in some metals, you can cut it and shape it any way you like.<p>In contrast, for engineered materials, at the most basic level, their properties are HIGHLY directional.  The cool thing about this is that it means that we can put the strength exactly where it is needed, and omit the strength (and weight) where it is not needed.<p>BUT, this means that these materials MUST be engineered.  The designer MUST understand the details of the loads and load paths, and design the material to handle it.  The fabricator MUST follow those designs exactly in hundreds of parameters.  Otherwise, the part will fail.<p>On the good side, it is not unusual for us to beat the performance of aluminum by 40-50%.<p>On the bad side, it would not be hard to make a carbon part that appears massively overbuilt, heavier and thicker than steel, yet would fail catastrophically.<p>(note that this is just the most basic level, and overlooks issues of the many types and grades of carbon or the hundreds of types of epoxy, chemistries, cure rates, bonding, inserts, etc., and their appropriate application.)<p>Carbon Fiber is most definitely NOT &quot;just fancy plastic&quot; or &#x27;black aluminum&#x27;, and that assumption is wrong and can be very dangerous.<p>(ironically, I agree with many of your other points, but that assumption really needs to be put to rest)",1444328847

This gives you the ability to scale the number of Storyboard files you have in your project.  If you&#x27;re having too many merge conflicts on the same Storyboard file, you can break up your Storyboards into more files.<p>That said, I&#x27;ll concede and say that the single biggest problem with Storyboards is that it doesn&#x27;t work well with text-based CVS, namely Git. Sure, fine.<p>...but, Storyboards offer a few HUGE advantages (all of which can&#x27;t be replicated by anything else):<p>-Storyboards are the single best way to document your UI and application flow. If you do all of your UI implementation in code, it makes it near impossible to determine these things without following a &#x27;run it and check it&#x27; approach. In Storyboards, you can visually see UI designs in a GUI environment, as GUIs should be displayed.<p>-Storyboards mean less code. You&#x27;re not maintaining constraint objects and configuration details. All of that is contained in the Storyboards. In my all-Storyboards projects, I&#x27;d say the codebase is 15-20% smaller.<p>-Storyboards allow for quicker iteration cycles. You can align a button by changing a slider value, as opposed to tweaking a constant and continuously recompiling + running the actual app.<p>-Storyboards allow for more effective UI design. You can see your UI, as you design it. This, opposed to trying to take a design mock and blindly replicating it in code.<p>So, my perspective on Storyboards is that, if you&#x27;re willing to sacrifice a certain amount of &#x27;code review blindness&#x27;, you stand to gain far more in the day-to-day and long-run of your project.",1444328565

This might be a good idea to move Track lighting to since they&#x27;ll have more freedom on the sockets and interfaces.<p>As far as other devices needing the AC power, you&#x27;ve got hair dryers, kettles, vacuum cleaners, air conditioners, water pumps, etc that all need more power than would be reasonable with low voltage DC (some might need 25-50 amps to run at the same power they currently use).

Internet-connected stuff needs to be able to talk, so awsiot needs to support messaging. So it looks like they&#x27;re currently offering http (publish only) and mqtt (bidirectional pub/sub). They give each awsiot account a unique IoT internet endpoint (some-random-string.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com), and then parse everything into a stored state in the cloud (that&#x27;s the device &quot;shadow&quot;)<p>2. Ideally you&#x27;d be doing this securely. awsiot appears to be generating its own x509 certs here, -- are they then an intermediate CA? Not clear on this. The documentation here is terribly vague and I have no idea what&#x27;s going on. Not good for transparency. I can&#x27;t even tell if they&#x27;re forcing security, or if it&#x27;s optional.<p>3. State management. awsiot cloud-stores the state of devices, allowing you to check them (or to issue commands to either from a third-party device like a phone app).<p>4. Communication between devices. They&#x27;re claiming some kind of wholly undocumented authentication system for access to and control over device state. At any rate, they have a concept of device-based identity, and then based on that identity, devices are (or aren&#x27;t) allowed to talk to each other.<p>I&#x27;ve done some IoT development, and though it&#x27;s a bit hard to tell by their terribly inadequate documentation, I&#x27;m pretty sure this is intended for enterprise developers with massive IoT product offerings and very high product volume. AWS is much too complicated for a lot of the small device manufacturers, at least the ones coming in from the hardware side. To use this scalably (especially given you can only access it from CLI) with reasonable product volumes is going to require a lot of setup scripting to register devices, and I don&#x27;t think companies will be able to afford the tooling cost until they&#x27;re enterprise-level.",1444327287

The &quot;real&quot; life implementation of this is that my kid&#x27;s college tuition is auto-deducted from that account, so if the cash on hand balance got to 0 it would liquidate money markets, and then long term stock holdings, to cover the draft.<p>That said, I personally have tried to balance dividend (income) paying stocks and short term bonds (6months to 1 year) which feeds into the cash balance, so that covers some of it.",1444327287

A recent example would be the entertainer 50 Cent declaring bankruptcy in the context of a judgment totaling in the millions.

You totally CAN get money out of CDs, just sometimes lose your interest.

The truth is you&#x27;re losing more money by not having any of it generating higher potential yields.  Likewise, putting all your money in higher yielding vehicles (for instance, call options) is a lot of risk too.<p>There&#x27;s a calculus to understanding how much you should have put into different vehicles (including cash in a savings account) to take on the most conservative position.<p>The way you&#x27;re playing is you are forfeiting and losing by taking on more risk than you think.  It&#x27;s weird to think about but you need to factor in inflation and cash becomes worth less when it is just sitting there.  It isn&#x27;t volatile but it is mainly deterministic.

Right after graduation a degree is a valuable tool, in theory, that an employer can use to assess your value.  When you're 45, your work experience and career accomplishments will/should outweigh any  degree(s) you might hold.  Of course, this is as related to tech-type jobs.  <p>I sort of see this ""slider"" concept for measuring the value of a degree, as it related to most of the things relevant to what we discuss here.  The more entrepreneurial and hard-working you are, the less value a degree holds vs. real-time hands-on work experience.  The more you want to rely on a steady paycheck in a cube-farm, the more you should thing about getting that diploma.<p>Some of the top wealth-holders in business and technology have no college degree (Slim, Gates, Ellison, Allen, Dell). Not to mention many more ""mid-level"" types who have done better than their peers, on-average, by virtue of hard-work and logical thinking.<p>In your specific case, I would politely say that I question the potential for ""freelance web development"" to yield an ongoing income stream of appreciable value.  My guess though is that you plan to augment or enhance those skills and continue moving forward.  In which case it makes sense to start devoting as much of your time as possible to that venture.",1192121950
66334,comment,66287,66307,0,0,davidw,,,"The ""externalities"" (CO2, traffic) are less extreme - at least on a per-unit basis, than threatening someone, or actually shooting them. We have the means, if not the will to make some attempts at calculating and taxing them.   I wonder what those sorts of calculations would look like if you calculated a value for each person killed by guns in a given year and spread that out over their sales in a tax of some kind.  Hrm.  Anyway, yeah, cars are useful, guns I can and do live without.",1192121880

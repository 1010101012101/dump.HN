The Yahoo/Facebook model, on the other hand, is to create a big enough garden that visitors want to stick around. The former model is not afraid of users being able to extract their stuff, whereas the latter loses much of its value when users can access their stuff outside the garden.",1324569445

By making scoping automatic, and (hopefully) forbidding shadowing, you can make the language conceptually simpler. Think of it as making variables be ""referentially transparent"" in terms of their lexical scope. Everywhere you see ""A"" within a given lexical scope -- you <i>know</i> that ""A"" always refers to the same thing. In a language with ""var"" and with shadowing, ""A"" could mean many different things within any given lexical scope, and you have to hunt for the nearest declaration to tell which one it is.<p>On the downside, you have what Armin describes: If you happen to try to use the same name for two different things <i>within the same lexical scope</i>, it won't work.<p>Since it's always the case that you are able to choose a more descriptive name for your variable, and gain clearer code by it, I think it's very much a tradeoff worth making.",1324569428

These same countries (and I class Europe as a pseudo-country) want to bring in legislation to prevent banks from doing what they did to create the first crisis in 2007.<p>But the interest rates are being set by the lenders, and this can be used as a kind of weapon to retaliate in this game.<p>What's happeneing at the moment is that the bond holders are basically trying to force the governments to raise taxes and cut public expenditure for no other reason than so they can get their money back.<p>Governments are caught in this trap because it's rather unfair to punish the people like this.<p>If you take a step back and look at the series of problems since 2007 you'll see that the banks were responsible for selling worthless ""structured debt"" to each other before realising they couldn't trust each other, then freezing all lending causing liquidity problems, and now using bonds interest rate weapons to effectively prevent governments from legislating against their bad behaviour.<p>It's a game of poker with some very high stakes: the options are a few banks choking or whole countries.<p>I'm not greek but the more I read and look at this the more I think they had the right idea to stand up to the banks. In the end they got half their debt removed, but unless all politicians stand together with the people and call it, this will all end in tears.",1324569365

And I also agree that it's a real risk to the ultimate future of our species. This is hardly a new idea: Olaf Stapledon wrote in ""Starmaker"", in 1937, about a VR-obsessed species anaesthetizing itself into extinction.<p>What I find curious is that many of the <i>very</i> wealthiest are rejecting this trend in very absolute terms. Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Robert Bigelow are spending their fortunes on real hardware rather than virtual reality, with the explicitly stated goal of making humanity a multiplanetary species. Other billionaires (Paul Allen, Richard Branson) are making complementary efforts, although without quite the same degree of aspirational rhetoric.<p>If they collectively succeed in establishing small colonies on Mars, then the initial rigours of colonial life will not allow for the kind of idle narcissism that is currently feasible for the wealthy on Earth. Whatever the fate of Earth, that will at least postpone the onset of a cultural coma for our species.<p>I tend to think that if this happens, then complete culture death at the hands of artificial pleasure is no longer possible. Once we're out of the deep gravity well of Earth, the marginal cost of establishing additional colonies elsewhere is very much lower; if even a very very small minority of the population keeps the spirit of evolution alive, then that will be sufficient to spread through the universe.<p>So, I don't really see this as a good solution for the Fermi paradox, since it seems highly improbable that EVERY civilisation would succumb to video games before becoming multi-planetary.",1324567216

3381748,comment,3380473,3381270,1,0,gmt2027,,,"My experience is in porting numerical algorithms to NVIDIA GPUs with the CUDA platform. If your intention is to decide whether a GPU port is worth it, then perhaps you should be thinking at a higher level of abstraction.<p>I only ""speak"" CUDA, however the primitives provided by the CUDA/OpenCL development platforms are largely equivalent. For a single ""kernel"" the GPU provides parallelism at two levels,<p>1. Fine-grained Thread-level parallelism: You have a group of threads performing ideally identical operations. The model is called SIMT (Single Instruction Multiple Thread) because it is not quite SIMD but close. Say you have (1-1024) threads, the hardware splits these into warps of 32 threads. The 32 threads within a warp execute together in classic SIMD manner, however only one of these warps is executing on the actual hardware at any given time. When a warp makes a request for data from high-latency device memory, it is typically suspended and another warp swapped in. This allows latency hiding between warps. However, calling __syncthreads() forces all warps to synchronise. Any conditional statements cause warp divergence, the warp is split and the alternative execution paths run sequentially. Clearly, this incurs a performance penalty as SIMD behaviour is lost and should be avoided as much as possible. The 'ideal' identical operation size is therefore a warp or 32 consecutive threads, however occasional divergence is acceptable. Memory access patterns are much more important however.<p>2. Coarse-grained Block-level parallelism. A block is an independent group of threads. The platform allows mutiple blocks to execute on different Streaming Multiprocessors. The hardware may schedule multiple blocks to execute on a single SM if there are sufficient resources (such as register and shared memory), this also facilitates latency hiding. Other than the kernel invocation which created multiple threads blocks, they are unrelated and cannot communicate or be synchronised.<p>The potential thread level parallelism is what should be considered. If your algorithm is representable as fine-grained floating point vector operations without excessive divergence then it is well-suited to the GPU. Of course, the actual performance gain depends on the quality of implementation and optimisation is highly GPU-specific and non-trivial.

Cut spending, you get an anti-stimulus, and a contraction.<p>But it's important to recognize the assumptions that go into Keynesian analysis, sticky nominal wages in particular. Sticky nominal wages prevent the necessary cuts in real aggregate wages, leading to unemployment (another way of cutting real aggregate wages). Keynesian analysis typically treats sticky nominal wages as given.<p>But is it? In the time of Keynes, government employment was a fairly small sector of the economy. This is no longer true - I've heard estimates that the public sector makes up 20-40% of Greece's economy. Further, even in the private sector (particularly in Europe), a lot of wage stickiness is caused by union contracts, minimum wages, and mandated benefits. Wage stickiness is also created by welfare/unemployment/etc - why get a job paying less than your old job if it only pays marginally more than unemployment?<p>So why not make use of this and impose wage flexibility by fiat? Cut the pay of government workers, force renegotiation of union contracts, reduce benefits and make welfare/unemployment/etc as unpleasant as possible?<p>I truly don't understand why Keynesians don't push for these policies.<p>(Note: I'm aware of the problem of nominal debts, these could be mitigated by making it easier to settle debts.

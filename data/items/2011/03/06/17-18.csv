(Immigration and Naturalization Service) were as big dicks then as they are now.<p>Okay... so...? Did you wait 10 years for a Green Card while in immigration limbo? Do you even know the difference between then and now?<p>>And yet, despite the INS's dickitude, the country churns out startups like crazy.<p>So enough is enough? Will more hurt, esp with 10% unemployment? Maybe we should shutdown some VCs as well, since there are enough startups.<p>AFAIK the Chatroulette founder was on a temp visa and was exploring options for a longer term visa. Can you reference how he 'moved' here?<p>>And I also know some who went back because their H1B visas expired; but you know what? It is good to see that. Just like seeds from a flower spread far and wide with the wind, I hope the seeds of entrepreneurship spread far and wide; the worlds needs more entrepreneurs. Silicon Valley has more than enough.<p>Your argument doesn't make sense. According to you the US/Silicon Valley is the best place to breed startups.. but you want the potential founders to go elsewhere where they might not have the best chances.

We have done research on both markets and we have had great response to both ideas. Here is where things get tricky.<p>On one hand we have a product idea that definitely solves a problem for a small industry. We have spoken with 10 or so players in this industry and they would all be willing to pay for our software (they are hungry for a solution). This would be a very stable income producing product / company that could go on for years innovating in this industry but its growth potential would be somewhat capped. I can see it getting to 5+ million a year in revenue with 60% profit margins but then it becomes much more difficult to grow. Getting to 10 million would be a short term ceiling (Pending some other added revenue sources).<p>On the other we have an idea for a consumer product that has a huge market but a lot less predictability. Obviously the market is much bigger; but there are other players, the price points are much smaller, and there will be continuous competition because of potential for growth and future payouts.<p>What project do you think we should pursue?<p>Is it possible to get funding for a smaller market product?",1299433522

As time passed, there were millions of people getting jobs as technicians, programmers, system administrators, and service providers.<p>Cisco, Sun Microsystems, and Netscape enabled the Internet to be a viable platform and communication medium.  You had even more jobs created: more programmers, web developers, web designers, and service providers.<p>Google did their thing and revolutionized how people could monetize things on the Internet, and how people could get their websites, products, and services discovered.  It`s pretty much because of them that many websites became viable businesses, to say nothing of how SEO also became an industry in its own right.<p>Now see Facebook, Twitter, Android (acquired by Google in 2005; if you want, you can throw Apple's iPhone group in there too, though by this time, they can no longer be counted as a startup).  They've created social media ad agencies, app developer economic microcosms, and so on.<p>Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.  The benefit that tech companies create is not from direct employment.

Then your talking should be focused on getting yourself a job. Only look for minimum wage job if you are financially desperate.<p>Otherwise, spend the time figuring out which start-up to apply for. I graduated last May and it took me 8 months to land my first ""real"" job. The key component I learned is that out-of-college will have a hard time landing contract or a job at big companies. Your best place to land a job at is a start-up because they are more willing to look over lack of work-experience for having actual skill set. As long as you are good at programming, you will be able to land a job.<p>I also took a different approach than you. Instead of going directly into start-up, I decided to first work at a start-up and learn how the start-up world works.

IT companies create less jobs per revenue dollar than traditional industries, do their manufacturing in asia and shift significant operations to overseas tax havens when they get big. It's not that I'm saying the US doesn't benefit from high tech startups, just that the effect is somewhat muted.<p>On the other hand, with such a majority of the world's service providers concentrated in just a few west coast cities I think there are some risks for the global Internet. What if someday we all found out that facebook, twitter and google were all collaborating with the government in a massive warrantless wiretap program ala AT&T et al. Wouldn't you be happier knowing there were some viable competitors out there based in .au .tw .ch .in etc? Is it possible that would have prevented it from happening to begin with? I'm not saying that's likely, but clearly there could be some benefits to a more politically and physically distributed infrastructure. What happens to the world if the US triggers their Internet kill switch? A lot more than when .ly did presumably. What if the world misses out on the next big thing because of the tight knit group think that exists in the bay area capital scene? Mother of all earthquakes? State government collapses?

The other problem with /tmp is that it isn't ""garbage collected"" very quickly -- on my Fedora server, unreferenced /tmp files stay around for up to 10 days.<p>With GCFS it looks like you could get rid of /tmp altogether.  Applications could just create a directory anywhere (eg. some random name under $HOME) and then ""detach"" it by removing "".."", and then keep it open for as long as they need it, after which time it gets GC'd quickly and automatically.",1299431703

In an imperative language, you can do this through adding a simple global variable.  In a functional language, you have to change the signatures of all the callers to add this new parameter.<p>A lot of people pointed out that in a real program, you're asking for massive maintenance headaches if you connect two independent leaf functions through a global variable and make their behavior interdependent.  In <i>that</i> context, this isn't a strawman, because somebody actually did suggest structuring programs this way.<p>Make a silly suggestion, get a silly reply.<p>I think both authors would do well to focus less on individual languages or programming paradigms and more on writing actual large-scale software systems.  Because the imperative, OO, and functional worlds basically converge on that point: <i>don't do that</i>.  You don't want the behavior of apparently-pure functions to change based on hidden, undocumented state.  And once you document it, you might as well add it to the function signature, which is your ""executable documentation"" anyway.",1262195990

1022819,comment,1022430,1022767,0,0,jerf,,,"As I said, it is a common misconception, but you <i>do not</i> get direct access to the table you just created in this case. Ets sets up a process which manages the table and all manipulations on this table go through messages to that process. It's all nicely wrapped behind an API that hides these messages, but they are there nevertheless. A value that has to be obtained via message passing is <i>not</i> a global value. There is code in the way that is controlling access, verifying legality, and in general it compiles to a whole array of stuff, as opposed to the true global variable case which can be represented by one memory save.<p>You have to be careful to think about this clearly. The defining characteristic of a true global is not that it <i>can be obtained in some manner</i> from everywhere in the program; by that standard even in Haskell everything's global, as there exists <i>some</i> organization of the program that would permit access of a given value from everywhere (though it would be one hell of a bastardized program). The characteristics are that everybody has direct, simultaneous access. If ""ets"" tables qualify as ""global variables"", then so do values sitting on a MySQL server; in erlang the difference between a MySQL value and an ETS value is pretty minimal, you access both via message passing. This is not a useful definition of ""global value"".<p>Now, it may still turn out that even with this level of access, it is ""too free"" and still subject to a <i>reduced</i> amount of the pain that global variables can bring. Haskell is a constructive example of a language that implicitly makes that argument and further distinguishes this case. But we don't benefit from failing to discriminate between a managed value that the manager permits anything to access the gate (albeit still in a managed fashion), and a completely unmanaged global value. They do have some similarities, but nevertheless, managed variables are nowhere near as bad as truly global variables.<p>If you're not careful and you come at this with fuzzy enough thinking, you'll end up spinning yourself into a tizzy where everything's the same. In fact what the situation is is that there's tens or hundreds of ever-so-slightly different cases and terms that try to cross the language barriers often have some issue, but there's still some broad patterns we can find, and if you find yourself just smooshing them all together you're going to find it hard to pick the right tool for the right job.",1262195830

I may be wrong, but the charges seem to point that way.<p>The charges against him in the article were:\n    * Conspiracy to commit {wire,mail} fraud\n    * Bribing foreign officials<p>Conspiracy is what federal prosecutors go with when there's no actual crime committed, since it doesn't actually require a crime for a successful prosecution (only that several people intended to do something illegal).  It's used as a stopgap to ""get the bad guys"", even when law isn't really there to support it. [for reference, check out the book '3 Felonies a Day'].  The bribing of foreign officials obviously isn't directly related to the ""fake"" university.<p>So we go a step further, and look into if it even should be illegal. If I set up cschneid's Drive Through University, I will obviously never get accredited by a proper agency.  But I'd probably argue that cschneid's Drive Through U should have free speech to print up paper saying people passed it's program, and have a degree showing that. No matter how bad that program is.  It still should be illegal to lie about accreditation status, or similar (but that falls under existing misrepresentation and fraud laws).<p>I'd say that this argument is parellel to the Underwriter's Laboratory.  The government does not mandate or require any electronics manufacturer to get certified by UL (afaik).  But many environments require a UL seal to use any electronics, one example being the dorm I lived in.  So it's a certification of quality, in the same way a university degree is a certification of quality for a person (by a 3rd party).  Presumably, I'd be able to start my cschneid's laboratory, and certify whoever pays me for my logo. Why is that significantly different from a diploma mill?<p>I personally have a university degree, from an accredited school.  But I dislike people taking social solutions (look up the degree & university in a database, say it's accredited), backed by existing laws (fraud, etc), and then turn it into a new set of laws, that restrict free speech.  I think to sum up, if I want to hand out bad diplomas, that should be fine, as long as I'm truthful about it. Existing laws cover this environment well, and printing paper should not be an illegal act without an intent to defraud.",1262195134

1022718,comment,1021950,1022236,0,0,Kadin,,,"The method (rainbow tables) is not new, no.  There have been several efforts to produce a complete set of precomputed tables for GSM's A5/1 algorithm.  What he did was finish the tables.<p>I haven't watched the video of the talk but I'm curious how he did it; I thought that some of the distributed-computation efforts were furthest along that path to completion.<p>Anyway, finishing and distributing the tables is not an insignificant achievement and makes A5/1 functionally much less secure, even if from a pure-math/academic perspective, the ""break"" occurred several years ago when the attack was first published.<p>Like many users and IT folks, I'm less interested in academic cryptography (though I find it interesting) than in the functional, in-the-wild side of things.  The existence of a theoretical attack using precompute tables matters a lot more when those tables have actually been produced and distributed in a usable form.  That's the case now, so that attack moves from being a theoretical one to a very real one.<p>The next step would be for someone to package the attack in the form of a script-kiddie-usable utility that would perform interception/decryption using an off-the-shelf GSM USB modem.  I have my doubts that the mobile carriers and handset manufacturers will take any significant steps towards mitigation of A5/1 until it's not only broken in the academic and hacker communities, but the technology to intercept calls is in the hands of every moron with a casual interest in snooping.  That seems to be how these things go; they'll drag their feet as long as possible, until the public pressure becomes unbearable.",1262193167

Production servers generally remained UNIX due to the costs involved. The IT organization shifted to MS, costs went up as the staffing necessarily increased to support administering Windows systems, expensive political maneuvering arose between engineering and business as they both fought to move to systems that they thought better aligned with business priorities.<p>At the end of the day, everyone wound up locked to MS with heavily entrenched political interests in keeping the status quo (and the job security that went with it).<p>Having seen the fall-out from migrations to MS products in corporate IT, I can't imagine voluntarily implementing MS as the primary <i>production</i> and <i>developer</i> system at a startup. You're locking yourself out of alternative solutions, you're signing up for significantly increased capital and operational expenditures, and perhaps most importantly, you're excluding an entire class of software engineers that primarily work on UNIX-based (including Mac OS X and Linux) systems.",1262192962

1022713,comment,1022542,1022628,0,0,AndrewO,,,"I hope you take this as constructive criticism (and not me just being a jerk :), but I see a couple of problems:<p>1) JSON gives no benefit over a Ruby DSL (like ActiveRecord migrations).  Is the schema file going to be consumed by client programs written in other languages?  (Even so, in that case, you should probably just define ActiveRecord::Base.to_json_schema).  Two languages are unnecessary when one will suffice.<p>2) When you start to define the schema in code[ft. 1], rather than in the database itself, you're leaving the Active Record pattern (as defined in PoEAA) and should probably look at other patterns (and the libraries that implement them).  Data Mapper/DataMapper would probably be a good fit here.<p>Also, you're loosing the benefits that migrations give of dealing with changes to the schema over time non-destructively.  Dr Nic's Sexy Migrations did something that would diff a single schema file with the existing DB schema, but this is not the default solution.<p>3) Automatically generating forms from a model has tempted many Rails developers over the years.  A rudimentary method would be possible using the existing reflection data (i.e. no need for a JSON schema DSL) and some added metadata.  Google ""rails admin ui"" for some examples.<p>However, ""metadata"" can easily turn into ""writing forms in the model instead of the view"" (I've seen it happen).  That's why I'd avoid this.<p>Also any forms more advanced than a simple create/edit interface and you're probably going to end up writing a partial anyway, especially if you need to add markup for formatting (e.g. how do you control if the generated form vertically or horizontally oriented?  Meant to go in a table with others or independent?).<p>ft. 1: Rails' Migrations are a special case.  They should be a seen as a separate system from the ORM that was created later on to manage the complexity of changing schema.  ActiveRecord classes still define their fields based on reflection from the database.",1262192859

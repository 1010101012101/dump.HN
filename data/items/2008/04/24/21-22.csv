172899,comment,172355,172355,0,0,pius,,,"An interesting, but frustrating read.  Shirky makes statements that conflate what requires thought with what's hard and what's hard with what's impossible.<p>For example, he says:<p><i></i>*<p>Consider the following assertions:<p><pre><code>    - Count Dracula is a Vampire\n    - Count Dracula lives in Transylvania\n    - Transylvania is a region of Romania\n    - Vampires are not real\n</code></pre>\nYou can draw only one non-clashing conclusion from such a set of assertions -- Romania isn't real. That's wrong, of course, but the wrongness is nowhere reflected in these statements. There is simply no way to cleanly separate fact from fiction, and this matters in surprising and subtle ways that relate to matters far more weighty than vampiric identity.<p><i></i>*<p>Note the last part:  <i>There is simply no way to cleanly separate fact from fiction.</i>  Usually statements that start off as ""there is simply no way"" are wrong and this one is no exception.  This and many of the other objections he raised can be addressed by using the right ontologies in combination with techniques like fuzzy logic and webs of trust.<p>Also, one of his big arguments is that the Semantic Web will never work because the data will always incomplete.  He characterizes the Semantic Web as assuming a simple world in which all information is known.  This is completely false though, as the Semantic Web standards have specifically been architected with the Open World Assumption in mind.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_World_Assumption"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_World_Assumption</a><p>That's a pretty fundamental thing to get wrong if you're going to try to talk intelligently about these issues.",1209072187

Schools ARE buying Macs.  Pretty sure they displaced Dell to become number 1 in that market again (or was that just laptops?).<p>2. How big is big, exactly?  How much of the consumer market can they realistically get?  Once upper level managers decide they need the cachet of a Mac laptop precisely because of its must have status as a consumer item, how are the IT guys going to tell them they won't support it and keep their jobs?  There's some evidence this is happening with iPhone already.<p>""Too many of the people who control what computers those companies buy don't see Macs as 'real' computers.""<p>Those are probably people who are very cognizant of the stock market, and judge the appeal of potential suppliers at least in part by what the vendor's stock price is doing.  In the media, ""Vista is a failure"" and ""Apple is the hottest company in tech"" are strong memes right now.  I guarantee you that the ""decision makers"" are very aware of them.<p>Also, the unstated idea that Apple needs to overtake Dell and/or HP for its stock to continue to grow is badly mistaken.  When you have 3.5% world wide share, a single percentage point of increased market share is a huge increase in revenue and profit.  Add to that the fact that Apple's share of the market is mostly among the most profitable customer segments.  Much of Dell and HP sales are for product lines with razor thin margins.  So, no, it is not necessary for Apple to rival the dominant players in corporate sales to continue to grow.<p>UPDATE:  I totally left off the fact that Apple is really the most successful 21st century consumer electronics manufacturer, and are almost certain to introduce entirely new product categories.  They won't all succeed, but given Apple's track record it would be foolish to bet that none of them will.",1209071410

I mean, this is probably one of the most important trials concerning copyright and filesharing  today. But the prosecution really has no idea what they are doing. It's kind of funny.

487486,comment,486755,487372,0,0,time_management,,,"In the long-term, you can expect the tax advantages of ownership to be priced into the housing market. This is one of the reasons (rampant speculation is another) price/rent ratios are so absurdly high. Fair value, without the tax benefits, would be a ratio of 9-12, given the costs of ownership and the illiquid nature of an owner's position. With the tax breaks, the fair value's higher, but it still doesn't make sense to buy at a P/R ratio of 20+, especially since rents are also likely to drop across much of the country.<p>In New York, price/rent ratios are above 40. A $2500/month apartment will sell for over a million. It only makes sense to buy at such a P/R ratio if you expect rents to skyrocket in the near future, and Manhattan rents are already starting to turn back.",1235062492

These types of businesses are not likely to attract young hackers that will truly innovate. I get the feeling that (for the most part) route 128 is where good hackers go to settle down and live a ""normal"" life.<p>Another reason 128 doesn't attract the hacker crowd is the availability of public transportation. Its a pain in the ass to get to any of the major office parks / buildings out there without catching multiple busses or trains. Most young innovators don't have the desire or the money to pay for a car in Boston which is necessary to make it to the area.<p>So - fix public transportation first, and maybe some startups will decide to make a home out there. Hopefully that can slowly build the hacker brand east coast style :)",1235062476

But there's a problem: <i>it's in outer space</i>. There is no reason why we should be resorting to such measures when we have the potential to harness solar energy here on the earth's surface.<p>There <i>are</i> energy demands that must be met, and it is true that our needs will grow exponentially. However, more earthlings than ever (percentage-wise) have a sufficient source of energy, and I believe this number will continue to climb.<p>This is not to say that this company's efforts are a waste of time. Far from it. We need overambitious entrepreneurs to at least <i>attempt</i> these solutions so that we can better gauge the difficulty of the problem at hand. While this technology may not be realistically implementable, it very may well lead to a newer, more efficient way of harnessing solar energy. If this technology works, more power to them.

At my school, most of our teachers were at the very top of our college populations, ranking in the top 5% of our graduating classes.  The exceptions (the ones who went into teaching because they had no other options and thought it was ""easy"") are few and far between.  Most of us have master's degrees, and several have doctorate's.

487417,comment,486755,487274,0,0,Daniel_Newby,,,"One way is to buy long-dated call options on a broad range of issues: indices, index funds, precious metal funds, commodity funds, etc.<p>For instance, the SPY index fund currently trades at $80. Suppose you want inflation protection for it going above $100 by December 2010, and you want to protect $250k of your money.<p>You could buy SPY calls at a strike price of $100 expiring in December 2010. The cost of those call options would be about $8 per share. To hedge $250k, you'd need 3100 options, which would cost $25k.  If the price rises into the $100-$108 range, you'd start recovering that cost.  If the price exceeds $108, you'd start turning a profit.  If the price popped to $175 due to hyperinflation, your profit would be ($175-$100-$8)*3100 = $208k. (BTW, options are sold in contracts of 100, so for 3100 shares you'd buy 31 contracts.)<p>Honestly, though, I don't see this as a good idea right at the moment. The market has been volatile lately, which drives up the price of options. IMHO, inflation is not likely to pick up in North America for at least 1.5 years, so you would need to buy 2011 options, which raises the price even more. If I were going to hedge inflation, I would wait until the current stage of the collapse had reached a lower plateau, some time had elapsed for volatility to decrease and option prices to go down, then buy before inflation expectations build and drive up the cost of call options.<p>Whatever you do, never use the various ""ultralong"" funds for buy-and-hold hedging. They are strictly for short-term trading. (Well, you can do buy-and-hold, but you have to wait for the price to bottom out, and pray that the fund manager doesn't burn up all the money with failed trading strategies.)<p>Warning: I am not a professional options trader. This is not investment advice.",1235060139

Their high interest savings is great, and no fees!<p>With 2 mil, I would personally:<p>-Buy a place to live in the 400k range.  Housing is probably overpriced right now, but generally speaking the Canadian housing market is not too badly bubbled.  I really don't see a Canadian crash coming, but there may be a slight price reduction.<p>-Put 200k into a high interest account.  Easy to access, guaranteed return, etc.<p>-Put 200k into a new business.  But that is because it is what I enjoy doing, if you want to learn to paint, go to school, etc throw the money there.<p>-Put 200k in the stock market.  Canadian financial institutions are amazingly underpriced currently, and so are several commodity based companies.<p>The remaining million I would use for stability/hedging.  Hedge against the Canadian dollar, inflation, etc.  I would probably get some professional help from investment banking friends, but this would probably be a combination of US bonds, CDN bonds, gold, etc.<p>The Canadian economy is currently almost untouched by the current recession.  There will be a bad 2-3 years at a minimum coming up so plan for that.  I would plan on shifting into the stock market cautiously over a period of time and not throw it all in at once, we could easily see another 50% decline over a few months.<p>Lastly, I would take a month and travel around before doing anything at all.",1235059999

And with good reason: money is dropping out of the systems at an alarming rate, demand across all geographical and international boundaries is down and falling and it has never been more difficult for an entrepreneur to make a buck or two. There are, however, signs that the web is going to emerge out of this current crisis as a stronger place to do business, and more importantly what money is spent over the next twelve months by consumers will be more likely to be spent online. This translates into increased revenue from web based advertising and affiliates, as well as increased revenue from recommendations, product placement and even direct selling. You will note that this is the way in which most web businesses generate their income. So to understand how to maximise your revenue in the coming months, it is a good idea to understand what is happening and what is likely to happen in the use of the internet by consumers.",1235059691

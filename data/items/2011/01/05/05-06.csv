And the First Amendment isn't just some law--it's a cornerstone for our relationship with our government.<p>Is it ""ok"" to publish the secret documents?  Of course not.<p>But allowing the government to punish third parties for publishing the documents is even less ""OK""!  The US government is heavily restricted because history has shown that a government will abuse the hell out of its citizens.<p>And sometimes this means the US government's hands are tied, and people that do ""bad"" things are set free.  But the Founding Fathers agreed that the greater good was served in this manner... and I concur.<p>It sucks that the secrets got out.  We need to take steps so that it won't happen again--such as not allowing people to walk out of secure areas with freakin' CD-RWs!<p>And finally, I have a practical argument against publisher restriction.  Once the secret has been stolen, it WILL get out, and it will get out BIG.  How many mirrors of WikiLeaks are there?  1000?  How many of those aren't under our jurisdiction?  How many are in countries unfriendly to the US?  Are we going to go to war over someone's web server?  No.  So even if you grant the government the power to punish the publishers, you still won't keep the secrets secret.<p>If you want all this abusable power given to the government, I'm going to want some appreciable effect in return... and there is none in this case, so... no thanks.<p>I'll agree with you that it's not ""ok"".  But that's as far as I go.  It's also not ""ok"" for a guy who committed an unwitnessed murder to not say so on the witness stand.

Typically this includes a salutation at the top and a signature at the bottom of some sort (usually a standard file).<p>Of course <i>you</i> are free to leave all of that stuff out, but if you write me 'give banana' without any introduction or explanation the only place where your 'instant' email is going to go is the trash bin.

I spent much more time working on semantic issues than I ever did working on the raw XML, orders of magnitude difference. The XML was always the easy part, even if JSON would have been even easier. The trappings are irrelevant. I could transform the entire XMPP protocol stack into JSON in a week, with implementation in ejabberd and one of my clients. XML is a sideshow.<p>The problem is getting the standardized semantics. If XMPP taught me anything, it is that it doesn't matter how many specs you throw at a programmer, they're just going to bash on the program until it sort of works most of the time and release it. That's where your roster problems come from, it's where a not insignificant number of your transport problems come from too. (Though the transport protocol is one of the spottier bits of the protocol.) The core bits of XMPP are generally reasonably well specified and in my experience actually held up surprisingly well as I bent and spindled it a little bit. (Corporate customers don't ""get"" rosters, don't get that you can start with a blank roster and work your way up, so I added a module to build rosters based on grouping criteria specified by the user and driven by outside input. Well beyond the stock ejabberd shared rosters, but pretty custom to our environment. XMPP actually dealt with these semi-magical roster entries just fine, to my surprise.) Those specifications <i>really matter</i> and just sort of bashing some stuff out that's 90% correct most of the time isn't good enough when you're trying to communicate with so many different systems. XMPP actually managed to avoid a lot of problems that even the ""professional"" systems had, having learned from their experiences; AIM last I knew still had some encoding corner cases you wouldn't expect in a modern program, all of the protocols had major encoding growing pains, surprising versioning issues, all these little quirks inside them that you never noticed because you can paper over a lot when you control both the clients and the servers. Again, I know it's not perfect but in the space of ""deployed IM protocols"" it does not make a bad showing.<p>IRC clients are actually just as quirky, IRC just doesn't hang on to anywhere near as much state or you'd see it mangled, spindled, and mutilated too. (Also part of the reason it's not a replacement, real users <i>want</i> that state.) This is fine, too, I don't have a problem with IRC for what it is, but you can't just drop it in everywhere you see an XMPP server.<p>If you try to work IRC up to be a real, true XMPP replacement, you'll be complaining about how hard it sucks in no time. Too much suckage is in the problem space.",1294204660

Please use grown up sentences.<p>> The connotations are different, that's the slant someone is trying to put on whether their discrimination is good or bad. We change how we act towards one person such that they benefit relative to another's detriment. Whether it be preferential treatment by omission of detriment or preferential treatment by application of benefit if the treatment alters according to the characteristics of the subject then we have discriminated.<p>You are a one trick pony -- once again you try to deflect. The guy declared he was not giving someone preferential treatment. It does not matter whether this is by lack of advantage or by taking away disadvantage, non-preferential treatment by definition is not preferential -- therefore no one is getting advantage to another's relative detriment.<p>> The question doesn't bother me. I don't think your assumption stands to much inspection - I'm sure you can imagine many scenarios that would leave someone in an ""entry level"" position against their will. Why does it matter how old the person is, can they do the job, will they do the job? One can change one's age no more easily than one can change one's sex.<p>Hrm.... deflection again! The fact that a reasonable assumption can be made does not eliminate other possibilities. Yes, a person's age is strictly a product of forces outside his control, however getting an entry level position at that age is certainly within his control. Why choose that route? There are other options. Why not choose them. In these cases of choice, it is worthwhile to examine the candidate. See by examining one's choices, you can maybe learn about their ability and willingness to do the job. (remember, these are the things you claim to care about, and now we can learn about them!)<p>> I love these sorts of closing statements, they must be the thinking man's ad hominem ""anything that disagrees with my stated position would be idiocy"", that's almost the definition of tiny-minded simpleton. </sarc><p>Ohh, man out of nowhere-- deflection! I never saw it coming-- honest. It's not really <i>ad hominem</i>. Not even kind of. Im not even declaring you to be idiotic, in fact, since disingenuous is pretending to know less, I sort of did the opposite. I have no problem even with you disagreeing with my position. I was merely preempting a disingenuous position of moral absolutes being attached to a word that has vague boundaries on its applicability (rendering absolutes impossible).  You have clearly demonstrated your understanding of the vague edges of the word discrimination by using it in two different senses already, so any claims of not knowing at this point would be false. Looking up the definition of disingenuous will get you the rest of the way to my statement.",1294204556

This can be subject to fixed volume discounting, etc. - i.e. someone buying 50 licenses prior to the currently contemplated sale of 20 licenses could have paid less. However, try telling a potential customer that someone previously paid less for the product they're thinking of buying and at a minimum you'll have a hold-up of months of red tape as they get an exception to their purchasing checklist authorized. These corporate purchasing processes are highly inflexible and often imposed by Sarbanes Oxley ""internal controls"" measures (meaning they're dictated by outside auditors, and not up for discussion) - they are real and need to be factored into pricing strategy.<p>A good workaround we found is this: make your early licenses have some type of specific restriction or obligation that you will relax in the different class of licenses you will sell later in the company. You might restrict early licenses to dealing with a certain type of data, or you might even add the obligation of participating in a ""marketing case study"". Do something along those lines (and get it actually written into the contract) so that in the future, you can with good conscience sell less restricted licenses at a higher price point under the inevitable MFN clauses you'll get with Enterpise software sales.",1294204005

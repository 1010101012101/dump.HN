8156168,comment,8153341,8156135,3,0,bmelton,,,"Anecdata, I suppose, but while I never cared for guns myself (until somewhat recently, I&#x27;ve become a convert), until I moved to Hawai&#x27;i, I honestly don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;d been in a single home that didn&#x27;t have a firearm in it.  To be fair, I grew up in the South, Virginia and Tennessee, but never rural south, and, to be even fairer, my father was military, so a lot of the homes I&#x27;m speaking of were Marines.<p>That said, even outside of military homes, everybody I knew had a firearm of some sort.<p>Beyond that, as I said, I&#x27;ve always been a staunch civil rights advocate, but I&#x27;m a recent convert to firearms.  I never had any experience with them or opinion of them whatsoever, and always believed that, hey, this is America, if I ever need a firearm, I&#x27;ll go get one.  It wasn&#x27;t until my current home state attempted to ban a variety of firearms that I got interested in the history of the second amendment, and came to the conclusion that the bans they were enacting were unconstitutional.<p>Since then, in addition to the protests for marriage equality, against NSA surveillance, etc., I&#x27;ve begun attending firearms rallies.  In my experience there, I&#x27;ve met many gun owners, many of whom have been asked to self identify as to whether or not they own firearms over the years, and overwhelmingly, the response is &#x27;Nope.&#x27;<p>So, the long and short of it is that while I believe the 33% number is too low, I don&#x27;t have any idea how low it is.  Of course, having seen outright, provably false statistics in use by gun control advocates (and again, to be fair, the gun rights advocates aren&#x27;t always forthcoming with statistics, but I have found their side to be more truthful), and provably wrong exaggerations (e.g., 40% of firearms were purchased without going through a background check), that leads me to believe that the variance is higher than just a couple of points.<p>Admittedly, I can&#x27;t prove (nor am I trying to) that it&#x27;s 50% or greater, but while the census puts &#x27;urban&#x27; populations as comprising ~80% of America, most of those urban centers aren&#x27;t big cities like New York, Chicago and San Francisco, and outside of areas with heavy gun control, gun ownership rates skyrocket.",1407556268

You don&#x27;t compete against Starbucks on the basis of scale and uniformity.  If you do it at all, you do it by offering a higher quality product (not an unreasonable proposition), or by offering greater customer intimacy (also not unreasonable) or maybe by achieving better operational efficiency and competing on price (this one seems like a stretch).

Starbucks is vulnerable to competition from companies that follow a different value discipline, and that&#x27;s why there are still local coffee shops, even where there are Starbucks stores.<p><i>When big corporations die, it&#x27;s either because of their own mistakes, or some seismic market or technological shift (e.g. Kodak).</i><p>That&#x27;s probably mostly true, but the big corporations don&#x27;t have to die completely to allow smaller competitors to co-exist.",1407555943

I received another C&D stating:<p>&quot;we sent you a letter demanding that you cease and desist from all violations of craigslist’s legal rights and Terms of Use (“TOU”). Our July 11 letter’s demands included, among other things, that you cease and desist from distributing your “Craigwatch” software and that you not induce or assist others in violating craigslist’s legal rights or TOU.<p>In response, you represented via email that you “deactivated Craigwatch.” We appreciate your cooperation, however, it has come to our attention that you continue to offer and distribute your Craigwatch software on Github. As explained in our July 11 letter, such conduct violates craigslist’s legal rights and TOU. Further, your actions induce others to violate  craigslist’s rights as well.&quot;<p>I was thinking of responding:<p>As legal council for Craigslist, perhaps you will thank everyone there on my behalf. I really appreciate all the time, effort, and resources that they put into offering such a useful free service. I&#x27;m sure many other people appreciate it to.<p>The code in question which was posted on Github five months ago (before your initial Cease & Desist), doesn&#x27;t--and never did--directly reference craigslist, Inc. It&#x27;s code which can be used to search any site, like a web browser. Further, the code is in the public domain under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/) and being hosted by github (not me). I call into question my requirement to comply to craigslist, Inc. terms of use since my script didn&#x27;t directly access CL&#x27;s servers, websites, or content therefrom; it was accessed indirectly by the users.<p>Is my code technically generic enough not to violate their TOU? Am I bound by their implicit contract? Does it even make sense to take down something from github?",1407555651

If you believe that Coase[1] was right about the &quot;nature of the firm&quot; vis-a-vis transaction costs[2] then it would follow that technology that can reduce transaction costs reduces the advantage of being big.  And since there are innate downsides to size (people usually ignore this point), transaction-cost-reducing technology should generally work against bigger companies.<p>Is that happening? I don&#x27;t know, I haven&#x27;t really studied the issue, and I don&#x27;t have enough data to say.

(also known as : NEVER sign a contract with any royalty or any parliament or congress. They are not bound by them. Just don&#x27;t get yourself into that)<p>2) How would you even know the terms of a contract ? People may think they agree about every detail, I have done enough law to know perfectly well they never do. Given the chance, people will sign things like &quot;I rent this room for 800 euro per month&quot;, for example. Now, the primary renter dies in a car crash, what happens ? Who owes what ? What if they&#x27;re married ? What if there&#x27;s children ? Does the inheritor inherit the obligation ?<p>3) How would you resolve obvious assymetric bargaining positions ?

To take this to an extreme, a compiler that deletes any source files that contain UB could be compliant, but would also be one that no one ever wants. Much of the utility of C comes from its use as a &quot;portable high-level assembler&quot;, meaning that its constructs are supposed to intuitively map almost directly to machine instructions. Aggressively optimising compilers that exploit UB violate this, so they are not in the spirit of the language: UB is either unintentional (a bug), in which case the compiler should issue a warning; or it is intentional, in which case the compiler should translate it with the intention the programmer had in mind. Making assumptions that &quot;UB will never occur&quot; and using that for optimisation is &quot;wrongheaded and dangerous&quot;; C&#x27;s reputation for performance and efficiency comes from its simple low-level nature, not from overly aggressive compiler optimisation. Any optimising by the compiler should be at the instruction-selection level, and higher-level optimisation done with assumptions that are &quot;characteristic of the environment&quot;. It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that the &quot;UB = optimisation&quot; advocates seem to be mostly academics with an intense interest in replacing C with &quot;safer&quot; languages... and there&#x27;s no better way to further their own agenda than to &quot;legally&quot; disparage C and make it a worse language than it should be.",1407555293

We&#x27;ve got some neighbors who apparently refuse to neuter their cats, and therefore they tend to wander and are highly aggressive. I suspect they&#x27;re also <i>not</i> inoculated, and more curiously in my state (of the US), all domestic animals must at least be inoculated against rabies--so if their cats were to bite someone, they could face substantial fines. I&#x27;d imagine they aren&#x27;t aware of this. (They&#x27;ve also had a number of dogs that have turned aggressive, gotten hit by cars, and have presented themselves as a neighborhood nuisance, so it&#x27;s not the animals fault... some people just shouldn&#x27;t <i>have pets</i>).<p>The other problem is that I suspect they got the cats to keep local rodent populations down, but then they reason that the rodents should augment much of the cats&#x27; diets, so they feed them very infrequently (and thus, they tend to roam looking for food). According to local lore, resident snowbirds who move around for 3-6 months out of the year tend to get cats for this reason, then leave them behind when they depart for seasonal reasons under the assumption the cats will be there when they return. Often, they&#x27;re not.<p>Sigh.",1407554329

That would require more than 2n memory (and exactly 2n for things like ints or chars) but the speed-up should be huge because well implemented C quicksort on small structs really shines when it comes to exploiting characteristics of modern hardware (cache hits are more important than number of comparisons).",1407554323

8156102,comment,8150394,8156024,2,0,bane,,,"Well, strangely enough memory allocation/deallocation takes time. The fewer bytes you shuffle around, the less time memory operations consume. On some systems, once you start exceeding physical memory, you end up in swap space, which slows things down even further. Once you run out of every possible place you can stash something, your run-time effectively grows to infinity because your process has crashed.<p>So if your data is consuming 32gb of memory, and all 32gb have to meander their way into a register and back out, assuming a mov operation takes 1 CPU cycle. You&#x27;ve effectively had to move 64gb of data.<p>On a machine with 64-bit word length that&#x27;s ~537 million cycles to move in and 537 million cycles to mov out or about 1 billion CPU cycles.<p>That may not sound like a lot, but nobody just moves things into or out of a register. Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re doing some kind of multiplication. That&#x27;s 3 cycles per mul * 537 million = 1.6 <i>billion</i> CPU cycles.<p>And now you&#x27;re at 2.6 billion CPU cycles just to do something like &quot;multiply each of half a billion numbers by some number&quot; (assuming all the data fits in memory). Again, on a Ghz + machine that may not sound like a huge number, but hopefully you can see that the number start adding up quickly and I&#x27;m just calculating out a trivial operation of effectively 3 ASM operations.<p>One big mistake people make is assuming pointer dereferencing is &quot;free&quot;. But all that dereferencing takes time as well. The pointer has to be moved into a register, <i>read</i>, then that memory location has to be moved into memory and <i>then</i> you might be able to do something to it.<p>Or take something like the example given in Perl. In theory a hash lookup <i>can</i> be O(k) if you&#x27;re lucky. But that discounts the time it takes to run the hash function on the key, mov pointers around, lookup values, move more memory addresses around, search memory for a free spot to malloc (and if you&#x27;re out and have to swap to disk, there goes a couple billion cycles waiting for that to happen)....etc. etc. etc. Oh, your hash is 50% utilized, let&#x27;s wait while a new hash object is malloc&#x27;d that&#x27;s twice the size of your current one, and every k->v pair is rehashed and inserted into the new hash, then the old hash is destroyed.<p>In the middle of all this, your OS is moving the entire execution stack all over the place as it context switches through the hundred processes that you have running so each can get a chance to do what they do. So while your process may only &quot;need&quot; a 20 or 30 billion CPU cycles, it takes 2000 or 3000 billion CPU cycles for it to get all those.<p>I&#x27;m oversimplifying, modern CPUs are much smarter these days and make some thing likes context switching less expensive, but the point still stands. If you&#x27;re trying to compute something on lots of memory, it will take lots of time. Trying to fit your problem data into a more compact form <i>might</i> take less time if you run the numbers and figure out the cycle cost...which practically nobody who graduated school in the last 10 years knows how to do.<p>The next biggest thing you can do is algorithmic. You can often literally take a problem that will run until the universe grows cold, and turn it into a problem that can finish in a few minutes with a solid understanding of algorithms.<p>I&#x27;m continuously amazed at how relatively small datasets (small by way of the power of the machines we have today), and problems that should be quick single machine problems, get turned into entire racks full of machines running night and day. We&#x27;ve gotten <i>really</i> good at interconnecting machines to do useful things, but really stupid about how to get even a fraction of the performance potential out of an individual machine.",1407553781

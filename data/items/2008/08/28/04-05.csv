So our feeling was that the later you tried it, the better it was for us because we'd made a better impression with better technology. So we were never in a big hurry to get you to use it today. Tomorrow would be better.""<p>~Sergey Brin (cofounder Google)<p>That's a crazy mentality to have, and stands in such stark contrast to most of the frantic behavior of startups today.<p>Take your time and build a great product.",1219899323

And sure there are negative residuals like trickle down economics of the media and software publishers. But it is not cut and dried/black and white. What about fair use? What about abandonware? The law is what it is only now. We (as a society) change the law as we use it.

If you comment on my weblog, I have a right to reproduce it as I see fit, as you've voluntarily given it to me for the express purpose of reproducing it, knowing full well that I will reproduce it indefinitely. In fact, people who comment are almost invariably disappointed (or worse) if their comments are not reproduced immediately and indefinitely.<p>The website owner is actually doing commenters a service by publishing their comments. In the case where the website owner publishes links to the commenters' sites; the website owner has also compensated the commenters with a bartered advertisement. Even without publishing the link, the website owner has provided a service to the commenter that the commenter has purposefully chosen to utilize.<p>On the other hand, nobody has given the comment aggregator (Backtype in this case) any permission to reproduce any part of the website and/or comments. Backtype's republication of the content is allowed only if it is done as fair use.<p>From looking at what Backtype does with my own comments, its usage of the content isn't anywhere close to fair use. That will be especially true if/when they attempt to monetize my comments. I personally would rather not have Backtype (or any other company) republish my comments without my permission. Instead, I would rather monetize my own comments myself, on my own site, by implementing a similar service myself (see <a href=""http://firehose.diveintomark.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://firehose.diveintomark.org/</a> for an example).",1219898247

The entire reason it's endless is because it confuses and mingles legal and moral aspects:<p>- Yes, it's illegal.  I don't think anyone actually argues it's not, but somehow it still keeps popping up as an argument to support that it's theft.<p>- Legally, as far as I know, theft and copyright infringement have very different meanings.  I'm not a lawyer, but I'm willing to bet that neither are any of the people arguing piracy=theft.  Anyway, I don't really see how arguing and personal opinions can come into this.  The law is what it is.<p>- Morally, it's hard to argue that it's right, but at least this is the only part where you CAN actually have any kind of debate.<p>People arguing about different things without realizing it = recipe for endless, unproductive argument.",1219897435

Theft, in most if not all countries, is a criminal offense.<p>Piracy, formally known as copyright infringement (or copyright violation), is a criminal offense when done for financial gain, civil offense otherwise in countries which recognize software copyright. The vast majority of occurrences of copyright violation we see in the media are for personal use, not financial gain, thereby a largely civil legal matter, than a criminal one.

When you said graduate programs, I took you mean, all post-undergraduate programs. Since there are many master's programs out there of the one to two year length (especially professional degrees that can confer ""expertise"") I took a three year law degree to be fairly long. I have no doubt that you have a lot of knowledge about this, and obviously the number of years you state for the length of degree programs is accurate (although I guess, even more on your side would be the argument that although an MD is four years, medical education is much longer), I just had a misunderstanding of the sample space we were talking about.<p>Obviously you're correct that three years is not that long when compared to six.<p>I did mean for some of my reply to be in response to your post, obviously, but by no means was everything I said a reply to your post, but rather the thread at large.",1219896584

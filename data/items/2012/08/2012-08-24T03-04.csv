That's a kind of goto  a structured kind that's always paired with a return. This is higher level than the old-fashioned GOTO but that doesn't make it complexity-free. It's still possible to create spaghetti with it.<p>Maybe that sounds pedantic, but I don't think it is, because interaction complexity needs to be minimized just like other kinds of complexity do. When you call a function you are implicitly drawing a line between the caller and the callee. Imagine a picture of your program with all those lines drawn at once. That picture ought to have some order to it.<p>Side effects are a different kind of complexity.

4426103,comment,4411491,4414292,1,0,technito,,,"I suppose the difficulty in my stance is that my views are primarily for the most part qualitative-- meaning there really isn't data that could sufficiently back me. It's an opinion that could seem very vague when trying to quantify and then sourcing why this came to be is really all speculation.<p>There is such an abundance of money floating around in the space, consumers are increasingly becoming more likely to adopt these technologies, creating an environment most likely susceptible to innovation-- but the output isn't as significant as these realities should potentially suggest.<p>Forget significant technological breakthroughs, such as Peter Thiel frequently refers to-- I'm even talking about already existing technologies that aren't fully being leveraged and if they were could further lead to these significant technological breakthroughs. Why isn't this the case? Why is it that even though curbs can be lined with some sort of proximity sensors I need to drive 45 minutes to blindly search for a parking spot when these sensors can ping me the nearest spot when making a query? I think of all the data from every aspects of our lives that is quantifiable and we create on a daily basis and how if this was curated then interpreted to the consumer, how much more efficient lives we could live-- why isn't this so?  Why is it that that the digital world is still yet to merge with the real world? Even from a product standpoint-- I find that i'm increasingly using products where it almost seems as if the founders aren't using the product themselves. I come across way too many flawed user experiences and to be honest it is beyond frustrating to me. Last week a 20 under 20 special highlighting the Thiel Fellowship aired on CNBC, so I set my TiVo to record it not knowing it was a 2 part special-- TiVo knows this. Why would I want to watch one part and not the other? Why wouldn't a notification popup ""Since you've recorded this, It's very likely you'd want to record this as well. Would you like to?"" This is a minuscule example but I believe everything that i'm saying stems from not a lack of resources, not a lack of ideas-- but rather a lack of depth in their thought when conceptualizing a solution to the problem all the way through to executing.<p>So why is there seemingly such a lack of thought? There are many possible reasons why, many of which are likely out of my control-- but I do believe that part of this problem which I can potentially make a difference in, is a deficiency of inspiration. Inspiration is directly correlated to consumption-- so if people aren't inspired enough I feel it's not illogical to question what they are consuming. Technito is my attempt to cover startups and review user experiences in such a way, highlighting the subtle features that most oversee but really confirm the user experience of companies and founders that make you scratch your head and question. The reader, should it be an entrepreneur will be inspired to view product in a much deeper way and should it be a consumer will walk away with setting a higher standard and having greater expectations for the products they use which will ultimately trickle throughout the entire ecosystem.<p>Independent bloggers that aren't reliant on ad revenue, such as Fred Wilson are likely not going to be as click driven-- but the reality is the bulk of content created (especially covering startups) that most of us are then consuming aren't coming from independent bloggers, but rather tech journalists working for media companies. I'm not claiming that the only source of revenue for these sites are ad clicks-- but traffic is their currency, and they are well aware of that.<p>My integrity is something that I take pride in for the fact that it will always remain in tact. What I was referring to was the integrity as far as the public perception is concerned-- which any way you look at has it's best chance of fully remaining in tact if the platform isn't monetized.<p>I am relatively new to the HN community-- I'm probably going to post this link a couple more times with the hopes of maybe gaining some traction. Do you have any suggestions for titles/headlines that would appeal most to this community? ""Open letter to Silicon Valley: A True Story"" does seem a bit hostile now that I think of it (the irony)-- which was likely why you perceived it the way you did in the first place. Any suggestions?

The reason they are called rapid prototype machines is because their capability to is fairly well limited to prototypes. The time required to print an object vs. injection mold an object is at least one order of magnitude apart, for state of the art machines (between many minutes to hours for 3D printers compared with seconds with most injection molding processes). It will be many more years before 3D printers, and especially hobbyist level machines, can produce parts comparable to those made in traditional manufacturing (read: high capital investment) techniques in regards to cycle time, surface finish, variety of material, consistency, and durability.",1345779716

Winning projects at <a href=""https://www.elance.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.elance.com</a> takes more than showcasing skills; it comes down to communication, which you're really good at, so I think you can win some bids there. Focus on the fact that English is your first language, because they're many on there that aren't fluent (and just auto-bid). Also set yourself up as a company, rather than as an individual.<p>3. Love your minimalistic approach (don't spin it as you're not a coder). Spin it as you've got that scrappy attitude that most hackers have.

Finally, don't get a second food service job, but neither should you quit your current one. Having one job I feel gives you a network that you may not otherwise have access to, and keeps you sane in times of persisting amongst failures. Keep your second job to building your websites. It's not easy, I know - I'm a student working a day job, and on web projects as well - it tires the crap out of me - but you gotta love what you do (here's why: <a href=""http://startupframework.tumblr.com/post/29585034512/why-do-what-you-love"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startupframework.tumblr.com/post/29585034512/why-do-w...</a>).
Email me if you want to bounce more ideas off. Seems like you're in the boat I was in 2 months ago (I too got one year left of school with tuition money very hard to come by). You've got a lot of options, and it's great you're taking action to figure them out. Good luck. aaron [at] brownieinmotion [dot] ca.",1345778115

I understand where your coming from with the concern that the photogenic will absorb more funding than they should (a morally questionable advantage).
To a lesser extent I also see why the concept of having people choose, as if sitting in judgment, makes you uncomfortable.<p>I suspect however that you are thinking of the donation pool as a fixed one, rather than a flexible one. It seems likely that having a face, a name and a story will cause people to engage and ultimately donate more. Donor fatigue ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donor_fatigue"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donor_fatigue</a> ) is a very real thing, and specific interactions with specific recipients that have visible outcomes to the donor on a human scale do a lot to avoid it.<p>So the question really becomes:
Is it ok to let the photogenic people be more likely to get treatment if it means more people get treatment overall? 
Is it ok to let folks sit in judgment if it means they will save more people as a result.<p>I think we all have to come to our own conclusions. I for one am blown away by what this site is doing. I'm willing to let the photogenic do better than normal if it means more personal engagement.
I also think that we all make choices about who we help live and who we leave to suffer every day. Relegating those choices to chance doesn't seem to me to be any more moral than selecting on other criteria. In fact it's something you are already forced to do because their are several different charities out their to choose between.",1345778066

That's how this article kind of comes off. Like we should lay off and be thankful for what we have. And we should. But the web is all about innovation and finding better, faster, smarter ways to do things. Your girlfriend doesn't forgive you instantly now when you cheat because you were incredibly loyal in the past. Your boss shouldn't pay you when you don't show up and don't call for work because you had a perfect attendance record in the past. The fact is, IE went to hell and they deserve our scorn. If and when IE10 really does deliver on its promises them we can call be happy with them and start the process of forgiving and forgetting. Though I doubt version 10 will live up to the hype I'll be happy to give them all the praise in the world if they at least catch up to where Firefox and Safari are now. I wish they'd get on Chrome's level but that's a lot to ask right now. What the article says about IE is true but now it's 2012 and what they did in 1999-2001 just isn't enough to give them a pass.<p>I'd also add that though IE did innovate like crazy in their heyday, if they didn't someone else would have.",1345777224

They claim that they think they will reach an efficiency of 12%, like normal solar cells, but that's of course neglecting the fact that only a fraction (max half) of the sunlight is in the IR.

2467895,comment,2466445,2466445,30,0,allwein,,,"So after doing a quick analysis of the data on my iPhone, I've come to the conclusion that this isn't a huge issue at all.<p>First, I'll start with the WiFi data (WifiLocation table):
Among the information captured is MAC, Timestamp, and Lat/Long.  I have a total of 118,640 records in my table.  I did a ""SELECT DISTINCT MAC FROM WifiLocation"", and got... 118,640 records.  This tells me that it's not ""tracking my every move"" via Wifi location since there's a single entry for each MAC.  The question might be, is it updating the Timestamp when I'm near a specific Wifi Network?  My guess is no.  I did the backup and analysis this morning, April 20th.  Yet the last entries in my database are from April 16th.  This tells me that it's not an always on tracker and that it's not updating timestamps.<p>Next, I looked at the CallLocation table:
The same thing held true with this table.  The last entry on my phone was from April 16th.  Also, I have 6300 entries in my CellLocation table.  I decided to start restricting the precision of the Lat/Long to see if there were duplicates that would indicate ""tracking"".  At 5 decimal points, there were no duplicates.  At 4 decimals, there were a handful that had 2 dups.  At 3 decimals, there were more dups, with the most being 6.  At this point I still had 5672 uniques.  At 2 decimals, the most had 89 and I had 2468 uniques.  At 1 it really went down, obviously, and I was down to 253 uniques.  The other thing I noticed was that there was no regular timing of entries, and that when there were entries, a large number of them had the same timestamp.<p>So based on my analysis, this isn't a feature that enables detailed tracking of a user.  It will allow you to see if a user has been in a certain location the first time, but that's the extent of it.  For instance, I could see that I made a trip to Washington DC in late October of last year.  But you can't really tell my movements around my home town with any amount of precision.  My assumption, like others, is that Apple is using this to enable easier use of Location based services.  I assume (which I'm going to test), that whenever a user enables a Location Based app (Google Maps, FourSquare), iOS updates this database with all local cell towers/wifi locations and the Latitude/Longitude.  The more comprehensive the local database is, the quicker/easier it is for Location Based Services to help pinpoint a users location.  Instead of waiting for GPS to spin up and get a satellite lock, it will be able to get a more accurate lock off of cell tower/wifi triangulation.",1303325878

Looking at some of their numbers they block ~30+% of the light to gain ~1.3% of the energy you are better off with smaller windows and a high efficiency solar cell around the window.

There are enough worthless blogs out there.  Please don't add another one.<p><i>3. Be familiar with the startup culture - Each sport, industry, or college has a unique culture, with its own lingo, success stories, and taboos.

""fit in""<p><pre><code>  - If you do both a. and b., great.
  - If you do a. and not b., no one will care that b. is missing.

Offer a concrete skill</i><p>99% of the work in a start-up is either building or selling & implementing.  If you can do either well, great.  If you can't, then learn how and forget all the rest of the bullshit in this post.<p><i>5. Take an internship</i><p>Good advice, actually, for #4 above.<p><i>6. Send cold emails</i><p>Please don't.

There is an interesting crossover between usability and product marketing when it comes to homepages and messaging.
If you haven't already, I highly recommend Steve Krug's new book ""Rocket surgery made easy"", which is focused on guerilla usability testing. Usability testing is classically about identifying problems/improvements to a UI, but you can quite easily use the same techniques to test your homepage and figure out whether people understand the product and whether the homepage encourages them to try it out, etc.

2467809,comment,2466731,2467359,139,0,richhickey,,,"The issue is not single-pass vs multi-pass. It is instead, what constitutes a compilation unit, i.e.,  a pass over what?<p>Clojure, like many Lisps before it, does not have a strong notion of a compilation unit. Lisps were designed to receive a set of interactions/forms via a REPL, not to compile files/modules/programs etc. This means you can build up a Lisp program interactively in very small pieces, switching between namespaces as you go, etc. It is a very valuable part of the Lisp programming experience. It implies that you can stream fragments of Lisp programs as small as a single form over sockets, and have them be compiled and evaluated as they arrive. It implies that you can define a macro and immediately have the compiler incorporate it in the compilation of the next form, or evaluate some small section of an otherwise broken file. Etc, etc. That ""joke from the 1980's"" still has legs, and can enable things large-unit/multi-unit compilers cannot. FWIW, Clojure's compiler is two-pass, but the units are tiny (top-level forms).<p>What Yegge is really asking for is multi-unit (and larger unit) compilation for circular reference, whereby one unit can refer to another, and vice versa, and the compilation of both units will leave hanging some references that can only be resolved after consideration of the other, and tying things together in a subsequent 'pass'. What would constitute such a unit in Clojure? Should Clojure start requiring files and defining semantics for them? (it does not now)<p>Forward reference need not require multi-pass nor compilation units. Common Lisp allows references to undeclared and undefined things, and generates runtime errors should they not be defined by then. Clojure could have taken the same approach. The tradeoffs with that are as follows:<p>1) less help at compilation time
2) interning clashes<p>While #1 is arguably the fundamental dynamic language tradeoff, there is no doubt that this checking is convenient and useful. Clojure supports 'declare' so you are not forced to define your functions in any particular order.<p>#2 is the devil in the details. Clojure, like Common Lisp, is designed to be compiled, and does not in general look things up by name at runtime. (You can of course design fast languages that look things up, as do good Smalltalk implementations, but remember these languages focus on dealing with dictionary-carrying objects, Lisps do not). So, both Clojure and CL reify names into things whose addresses can be bound in the compiled code (symbols for CL, vars for Clojure). These reified things are 'interned', such that any reference to the same name refers to the same object, and thus compilation can proceed referring to things whose values are not yet defined.<p>But, what should happen here, when the compiler has never before seen bar?<p><pre><code>    (defn foo [] (bar))
</code></pre>
or in CL:<p><pre><code>    (defun foo () (bar))
</code></pre>
CL happily compiles it, and if bar is never defined, a runtime error will occur. Ok, but, what reified thing (symbol) did it use for bar during compilation? The symbol it interned when the form was read. So, what happens when you get the runtime error and realize that bar is defined in another package you forgot to import. You try to import other-package and, BAM!, another error - conflict, other-package:bar conflicts with read-in-package:bar. Then you go learn about uninterning.<p>In Clojure, the form doesn't compile, you get a message, and no var is interned for bar. You require other-namespace and continue.<p>I vastly prefer this experience, and so made these tradeoffs. Many other benefits came about from using a non-interning reader, and interning only on definition/declaration. I'm not inclined to give them up, nor the benefits mentioned earlier, in order to support circular reference.<p>Rich",1303324779

And it's not a ""problem"" for the person who was lied to; it's a boon. And if you weren't cheating, well, showing your call or location logs might be a way of saying, ""Look, I have nothing to hide.""<p>Privacy vs. disclosure of data is a complicated issue. It involves issues of personal autonomy as well as trust. Do you give up some autonomy because you know that people know what you're doing at any moment? Of course. But there is often a pay-off to doing so: people actually trust you.<p>Life is complicated, and you can't down-vote moral complexity out of life, no matter how high your karma is.",1303323269

The fashion industry is actually the perfect example of not being able to sue for 'look and feel'.

A 6% pay decrease for a 401k account might not be noticable, but when an investment can't be touched for 29 years there isn't a feeling of wealth attached to it.<p>I would assume that 10 years at this salary level may change that, but with the transient nature of tech this is not something that it assumed by most.

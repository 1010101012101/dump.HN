Disinformation.  Maybe it's about hashes, either SHA-1 (unlikely since there are known, feasible, collision attacks) or an unknown vulnerability in SHA-2 variants, and the NSA is trying to make people look elsewhere by talking about how they're going to decrypt mountains of old data.<p>2. GSM.  I don't think the entities the NSA cares about consider GSM secure, so I doubt it.<p>3. RSA, DSA, plain DH.  It's no secret that the NSA has been strongly encouraging suite B (EC-based) variants of older ciphersuites.  But why would they encourage people to be skeptical about security of existing non-EC public key crypto just a few years after they're able to start cracking it?<p>4. AES.  Nightmare scenario (no replacement in the pipeline).<p>Perhaps someone else has discovered whatever the vulnerability is, and they're too visible and cannot be coerced into shutting up, but were induced to shut up temporarily; in that case this could be part of a disclosure strategy by the NSA, possibly about a factoring/DLP advance enabling cracking of plain RSA and/or DH.<p>The article doesn't say anything was cracked, and the ""breakthrough"" is mentioned when talking about supercomputing.  It would take a mind-boggling supercomputing breakthrough to put 128 bit block ciphers at risk.  Could this be Bamford trying to sell more books by creating drama?",1331913534

You simply can't use it. If it is just some desktop software, I can stick with an ancient version until I fill sick maintaining the running environment.

Eliminate the following words and phrases: So, Now, But, In my opinion, anything you might put in a text message to shorten it, 95% of all words that end in ""ly"".  Tighten things up.  Nouns and verbs build great sentences, adverbs and adjectives stink up the joint.<p>2. Show, don't tell.  Don't tell me it's not going to be a post about pickups.  Show me it's not.<p>3. Effective use of parenthetical phrases is hard.  Read some David Foster Wallace for great examples.  When you say ""Ouch"" then stick the rest of the sentence in a parenthetical, it actually loses some of the punch because instead of being orthogonal to the ""Ouch"", it's should be the punchline of your joke.<p>4. Use imagery to get your point across. Instead of saying that you'd get wasted, say ""If some chic said that to me, I'd be headed for a three day bender that would make Ernest Hemingway look like a teetotaler.""  Paint the reader a picture.<p>5. I don't mind the ""bro"" style but it's going to put a lot of people off.  It's very tricky to do well but don't let that stop you if you like it.  Style is in the eye of the beholder.  Just tighten things up a lot if you're going to use it.<p>6. Write it one day, proof and publish it the next.  I find this to be terribly difficult.

That alone would be an unwelcome mat, but put on everything else we make people go through and we're pretty much just saying ""Go Away"".<p>Along with the fee and abusive questionnaire at this site <a href=""https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/</a> we've also got this lovely informational site <a href=""http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1262.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1262.html</a> and tons of other fees <a href=""http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1263.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1263.html</a> . Then of course after you've paid all your fees and told the US government all about your diseases, mental illness, and intention to spy on them, you still have to give them your fingerprints, photo, submit to a search, wait in line for 2 hours, and answer many more questions about the same stuff.<p>It's not xenophobia. It's full on we think we're better than you and you pathetic humans get to deal with us 'cos we said so. The whole system wreaks of 'cos we said so. Every citizen and border patrol agent knows it's excessive and ineffective, but we keep on truckin' cos hey, they're all just doing their, trained to be overly aggressive, jobs.",1331912762

3713694,comment,3713162,3713270,3,0,jandrewrogers,,,"Another aspect of this that I noticed among many of my own friends when we were in our 20s and poor is that most people from a middle-class background have no idea how to live inexpensively. Many other problems follow from this chronic overspending when they cannot afford it. The thing is, they thought they were being ""frugal"" but the reality is that they were not even close. If you look, for example, how most immigrants bootstrap from nothing their spending patterns and priorities look very different and they usually manage to save quite a bit of money over time.<p>Savings plays a huge role in flexibility. When you are in your 20s without family, it is eminently possible to bootstrap enough savings from a really crappy jobs and even temp jobs to have the flexibility to move if you need to and still live an okay lifestyle even in a new city. Been there, done that. Very modest but comfortable. You would not want to live this way forever but it is only a bootstrap. It also instills good habits toward not buying a lot of ""stuff"" once you have a good paying job.<p>I will add that this same pattern applies to people with very good jobs too. I know people making six-figures that swear they are just getting by, paycheck to paycheck, with no savings. Their definition of ""absolute necessity"" gets stretched to the breaking point but they literally do not know how to live on less money. I do not have much sympathy in cases like this but it is also part of a larger pattern of people militantly refusing to live below their means.",1331911872

I can be a little passionate about this.  I am truly sorry if my post went a little too far.<p>Those who govern us have the power to do great good or great evil.  It is my contention that a deep belief in anything supernatural should automatically disqualify someone from political office at almost any level.  I did say ""deep belief"".  The main reason I think that this is important is that those who are religious extremists are so invested in their belief system that they come to office with an agenda.  And this agenda is not based on a reality, no matter how many people think otherwise.<p>I did say ""religious extremists"".  My parents would describe themselves as believers. They'll never hurt anyone with or for their beliefs. They simply grew up at a time when that's what you did and that's what you believed.  They just happened to be born somewhere where the local ""team"" believed in Christianity, they would have believed just as strongly in any other religion had they been born somewhere else.<p>A typical example of religious exremism is the extension of religious judgement onto the gay community.  I'm not gay but have absolutely no problem with that community at all.  Why?  Because if I had a problem with that I'd have to have a problem with my kids having brown hair or long fingers.  Why?  Because it is a genetic mutation (not a pejorative, just fact) just like being born with blue eyes.  Virtually nobody decides to be gay, they are born that way.  They could have been born with green eyes just as well.  Yet, the religious extremists will judge these people harshly and reject the evolutionary basis of the phenotypes they dislike.  They'll pick something with no evidence of any kind against something that has mountains  (literally) of evidence all around us.  One of my favorite demonstrations of evolution is that my kids don't all look that same:  mutation at work.<p>The Santorum doctrine is deeply rooted on religious beliefs.  He is a religious extremist.  Virtually nothing comes out of his mouth that does not have a foundation on his faith.  That's why I think he is a dangerous man and sincerely hope he does not win the nomination.<p>This latest attack on porn is just an extension of that.  I don't like porn.  I think its demeaning and portrays an image of women that is simply grotesque.  Few things change your mind more than having a daughter, of course.  Having said that, I can't be on the side of restricting anyone's right to create or consume porn.  That's their business and neither I nor government has any place in what they do with their private lives.  Like it or not.<p>I do think it is OK to have community-based rules.  I don't want the stuff on TV for my kids to see.  They can't comprehend it and are not mentally prepared to deal with it.   I'm not saying that the Federal Government ought to set these standards.  It could be a States issue.  That said, I'd rather keep government entirely out of it.  The market can decide these kinds of things very efficiently.  For example, if porn was available without any kind of access restrictions on my satellite service, I would cancel it.  So would others.  Very soon, if that satellite company wanted my business they'd implement a sensible way for me to decide what I want my family to be exposed to.  That's the way it should work.  I don't want Santorum or anyone to tell us what we can and cannot do based on his deep-rooted belief in the supernatural.<p>My courtroom example exposes an aspect of this country that is troublesome:  If you don't profess belief in the same supernatural stories the religious majority pushes you can and are excluded from political life.  I wonder how many Senators, Representatives and, in general, politicians are atheists who begrudgingly place their hand on the bible when they are sworn-in because, well, they have to.<p>Think about it.  Views and stances like Santorums are no different than those of the extremist religion-based governments in the middle east we hear about every day.  We don't want that here.  If that means accepting others' freedom to make and use porn, so be it.",1331911761

If you are a local, it's better to bring your own bike. If you are visiting, the fees are very high since you have to start paying extras for a few minutes overage. Overages are easy to get because the stations are usually no where near where you are going unless you are doing short tourist jaunts. So you end up walking for 30 minutes to a bike, riding the bike for 15 minutes to a station roughly in the direction you are going, parking to avoid the fee, transferring to a new bike to continue, now you have to go further, then you get to closest destination station, park, walk 30 minutes to actual destination, and reverse to go home. Spend too long stuck at a red light and now you pay a fee for late. Want to ride somewhere, drop something off, then come back? To save on fees you have to factor in a bunch of stations and swaps, so a 40 minutes bike ride round trip if you had your OWN bike is now 90 minutes including all the walking to stations and swapping.<p>So just pay the fees. Or take the bus, which is cheaper and faster. Or rent a car and be done with all this.<p>The idea such inefficient systems are being taxpayer funded in some cities is offensive.<p>I agree with the other comment that it is quite difficult to navigate Boston traffic with a bike since the city is not built to accomodate it for the most part. Police are also highly aggressive, belligerant, uneducated, ignorant and thuggish and risk of being arrested and harassed for not being in the correct lane or whatever are significant.",1331910580

My proposal is that United States airport security give up on requesting passengers to remove shoes. Yeah, maybe have chemical sensing devices with air intakes at floor level to screen for bombs on shoes, but let us all wear our shoes onto airplanes and throughout the insides of airports.

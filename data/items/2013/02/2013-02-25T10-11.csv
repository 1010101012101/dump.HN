The layout of code helps enormously for us, but I find the effect is the same with reading if I go quickly and with specific purpose to reformulate the information as it is scanned.

For me (and I'm just getting started here, I've only been playing around with this in earnest in the context of the little blog engine, and there are certainly many different ways of going about it), it makes the process of exploratory coding feel very different. Instead of thinking up a series of classes or functions that might solve the problem, and starting to write them -- I instead start by outlining (literally) what I want the program to do, and then describe the functionality in paragraphs, and then implement those paragraphs.<p>When the paragraphs have code below them that does what they say they do, the thing works. When I end up coding myself into a corner, I rewrite the paragraph and change the code. It's really a very different process than usual. It's also definitely more work than just doing code and omitting comments -- it takes a bit of elbow grease to prevent the comments from becoming lies ... but it's the same type of work as preventing bits of your codebase from becoming dead code.<p>For me, it seems to make me organize code into smaller functions grouped together into sections, use less classes, and care more about putting things in the place where you're talking about them, and less about putting similar things together in one block of code. For example, I started to require things close to the paragraph where I first mention them, instead of putting all requires at the top of the file. At least, that's how it feels so far.",1361789070

The C program is very ad-hoc (returning a double from main is actually illegal and will lead to interesting results) and avoids all I/O, whereas the Verilog program seems to be quite complicated (in particular with the use of ready flags and clocks). Please correct me if I am wrong, but couldn't the authors just have used a continuous assignment (or maybe a simple clock) for their conversion? Also, don't newer verilogs support specifying IEEE floating point numbers in their natural form, as opposed to having to manually convert them to hex?

My wet dream is a pressure&tilt sensitive/e-ink based device, but it looks like the Surface Pro is the closest you can get currently - and this is a good review.<p>If you want a portable device (laptop/ultrabook/tablet) with a <i>good</i> digitizer that you can actually use (that is, wacom based), your options are actually very few.<p>There is the Lifebook T902, or the ThinkPad X230T. Did I miss anything else? Both are convertible laptops, both are quite heavy, have medium to poor battery life if you extend them with the additional battery, and a lower-dpi screen. I would have expected higher-range graphics on those laptops, but the integrated HD 4000 is ridicolous when you think you basically get the same on an ultrabook.<p>Not to mention that the price range is simply off. The Surface Pro is way cheaper.<p>I used an earlier version of the Lifebook T902. It's actually better than having a separate digitizer which takes useless space on the desk, but it's still cumbersome. You cannot draw unless you flip the screen (odd position otherwise). It's really heavy. A clipboard with paper is an all-around better.<p>There are two segments of markets that are filled by this usage pattern: on-the-go artists, and cheap cintiq replacements. Drawing on a cintiq is just awesome, but wacom has basically a monopole and the prices are just unjustified. Even the Intuos line is, IMHO, overpriced at least by a 2x factor. The sad reality is that they have absolutely no real competition. I tried several NTrig-based digitizers (lately the Vaio Duo 11), and they just suck. The tracking is just worse, many jumps just over a few hours of testing, not to mention that the pressure sensitivity is lower too (when you're drawing strokes it's quite visible unless the software is not interpolating it for you).<p>Just look at the missed opportunities there are! The Taichi 21 and VAIO Duo 11 are cool, but they use N-Trig. The keyboard on the Lenovo Yoga is awesome, but no digitizer. The Dell XPS 12 looks stunning, but again missed opportunity. It was rumored to ship with a wacom layer, but it didn't finally.<p>The only downside of the Surface is the keyboard. I tried the flip keyboard of the Surface Rt and I only hope that the keyboard from the Pro is different, because it sucks. Missed keys, zero feedback. Admittedly, it's better than typing on an on-screen keyboard, but the Taichi 21 of the Dell XPS 12 approaches are way better.<p>As a sad note, the replaceable battery concept is gone on all these modes. You know, I would settle for lower battery life if I could just have 2, or 3. I was actually shocked that at least HP offers the EliteBook Folio 9470m which <i>has</i> a replaciable battery in a thin format (the ultrabook is awesome), so there are really no excuses for it.",1361788959

5278250,comment,5278079,5278079,10,0,rohansingh,,,"Sigh. I'll actually do the job of debunking these one by one.<p>1. Almost every mainstream language has case-sensitivity. This avoids ambiguity by having only <i>one</i> right way to express a given variable. Since Visual Studio has excellent autocomplete, you don't have to repeatedly use SHIFT, and you are unlikely to accidentally mistype the variable name.<p>Of course, when I see an argument like, ""When you accidentally leave Caps lock on, it really matters,"" I have trouble taking the author seriously.<p>2. The reason switch is different from if-else is something you can learn from any language primer. The author makes the following argument: ""Its easy to forget to type in each of these Break statements!""<p>In fact, it's not easy. The ""break"" is required by C# in any non-fallthrough cases. Not typing it will generate a compiler error. Not something you can miss.<p>3. Here the author makes a red herring of an argument regarding how you can use Visual Studio to setup event delegates for UI components. Apparently some paradigms are supported for VB.NET, and others for C#. Of course, what your IDE supports has nothing to do with which language is ""better"".<p>The basic argument is that you need to return to the design view to create an event delegate rather than being able to do it from code view. Of course, most experience C# writers will stay in code view and just type the following themselves:<p><pre><code>    _myButton.OnClick += ... (tab to autocomplete new delegate and handler)

The author then continues to say that the comparison symbols in C# are ""stupid"" compared to Basic's ""And"", ""Or"", etc. This argument almost doesn't deserve to be addressed, but I'd like to point out that C# has the advantage of not overloading the assignment operator (=) with equality comparison (==). Keeping these separate prevents a common class of error.<p>5. The author fails to trigger autocompletion for creating a new property in C#.  This is largely because he doesn't know that the way you do this in Visual Studio for C# is to type ""prop <property name>"" and hit TAB. The behavior is then exactly the same.<p>Regardless, still a comparison of IDE features rather than languages.<p>6. The author complains that the ""PMT"" function, which ""calculates the annual mortgage payment for a loan"", is not a builtin in C#. I am not rightly able to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that would provoke such a statement.<p>7. The author argues against needing semicolons in C# for line endings. Alright, at least this is actually about the language itself. Personally I'm not a huge fan of needing semicolons either. A style thing, but I'll let it stand.<p>8. The author complains that the type for a variable declaration precedes the variable name in C#. Somehow this is a major problem. Obviously just scraping the bottom of the barrel here.<p>9. The author complains that C# does not automatically cast enums to ints or other types. I'll leave it to other sources that talk about the pros and cons of implicit casting a la Scala.<p>10. The author complains that is not possibly to reinitialize arrays to a new length in C#. He admits that he has been told that, ""I should be using lists and not arrays anyway."" But he retorts that, ""The point is that - as so often - Visual Basic makes something easier to code than C# does.""<p>I fail to see why using a List<string> is somehow harder than string[].<p>In conclusion, I really have to hope that this is a joke.",1361788657

5278179,comment,5278039,5278089,2,0,jibbirish,,,"I have had a few workshops on speed reading at my university, and what those guys said about subvocalization was something along the lines of:
We learn to read when we are about 6 years old, how do we learn this? By sitting in a classroom and reading out aloud a simple text, with the entire class at once. In this stage we start to connect reading with subvocalization, when we learn to read better the teacher tells us to 'read in our heads'. Meaning that you are still sub vocalizing. This is a limiting factor as one can (presumably) only speak around a maximum of 500-600 words per minute. Coincidentally, this is the maximum speed for which we can read with a high comprehension according to skeptoid.<p>I personally never thought much of the guys giving the speedreading workshops, they seemed to be acting and came across like secondhand car dealers. Their claims of comprehension with over 1500 words / minute just sound insane. The techniques however are not all nonsense, and I do believe that I have learned to increase my reading speed from +/- 300 to around 500 words per minute.<p>The most important lesson they thought was 'guiding your eyes'. Our eyes are not that good in following a straight line by themselves, just try to stare straightforward, and make a perfect circle with your eyes: it will more likely be a pentagon or something. When we let our eyes follow our finger drawing a circle however, it is a lot easier. Applying this to reading, simply means using your finger or pen to follow each sentence on the paper. I find it a lot faster to read that way, but I still let myself subvocalize the sentences, for comprehension. Doing this on a 500-600 words/minute rate is a lot more exhausting though, and I only use it for academic articles or textbooks.",1361787431

They are also surprisingly incompetent in the trust they assign to the knowledge they came by. test yourself: [1] is dietary cholesterol harmful? [2] does dietary salt cause hypertension?

The recommendation to avoid dietary cholesterol is NOT based on evidence (or logic, for that matter)<p>[2] for over 80% of the population, the answer is ""definitely not"".

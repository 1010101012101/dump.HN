A great book (I&#x27;ve read 75% of it so far).<p>About the error you mention - I think you are right - but the author brings up the ~1% because he is talking about &#x27;base rate fallacy&#x27; - he wants to say that the errors from the 99% of the population will swamp the true signal from the 1%.  So his ~1% number is likely qualitatively ok for what he is using it for.  It should still be reworded though - one wants 0 errors in a book about statistics mistakes :)",1411376228

8349714,comment,8345802,8348006,1,0,BSousa,,,"That is an interesting point, though not really applicable to my family as far as I know (yes, my father had it harder then my cousin or myself, as I think most parents do, but as for siblings, not really) My close and extended family were always middle class. We all went to public school/college (namely since around here it is usually better than private ones). Yes, we had a lot of advantages over other folks, but not really over other people in the family. We were also very close before the &#x27;money starter to pour&#x27;. Christmas, new years, any family member birthday, we all gathered, we celebrated, etc. When the money difference became apparent, most of that stopped. The joyful times were pretty much replaced with small talk on the times we get together.<p>And I agree with most of your ideas, and while I don&#x27;t know the lives of Gates, Page, etc, and I have no idea how they treated their family/friends, it seems you have an idea (maybe true, I don&#x27;t know, but it isn&#x27;t my experience) that as people go up the ladder, they change their attitudes (&#x27;develop a conceited attitude&#x27; and &#x27;will often have a wife and kids with a vain attitude&#x27; or &#x27;now better than the sacrificer&#x27;). Again, I&#x27;m talking about what I saw here, but it is usually the opposite (maybe cultural differences make it so), but you see a much more humble and giving attitude with people that have reached a good level of success than the ones that haven&#x27;t. The ones that do reach, usually appreciate all the hard work their parents did to give them the opportunities they have (I do every day), but the ones that didn&#x27;t usually blame everyone about their problems, but give no thanks/props to the ones that have helped them. Quick example, I&#x27;ve worked for a startup a while ago with one main investor (basically, he was footing the bill for everything until there were revenues). He is one of the richest guys in Portugal, and when I had some personal problems and I mentioned I needed 3-4 months unpaid leave due to that, the only thing he told me: &quot;Go, go take care of things, don&#x27;t worry about coming until things are good with you&quot;, and kept paying me the salary for those 4 months. Didn&#x27;t ask for a single thing, nothing.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is that maybe I have had a different experience with successful people than you, but in this corner of the world, humbleness and a giving attitude are much more prevalent when you go up the ladder than when you don&#x27;t, and it is hard to find people at the bottom (Even close friends) that don&#x27;t resent you for that.",1411374207

He&#x27;s talking about everyone who works on an ad-supported website that depends on page views, which is nearly all of them. Since revenue is proportional to page views, the driving concern is to increase page views rather than maximizing end user satisfaction, which only has secondary importance as <i>one</i> factor in page views, and often not the largest factor.<p>As to the free market, advertising distorts it very badly. The free market is based on consumers voting with their wallets. What happens when the wallets are held by advertisers?<p>And for what do we accept the above state of affairs?

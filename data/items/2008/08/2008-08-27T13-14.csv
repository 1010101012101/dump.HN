288012,comment,287927,287927,0,0,maxklein,,,"The real problem with keyboarding is the TERRIBLE lack of consistency. Apart from a very few commands, most applications seem to just randomly select keyboard letters to map to tasks based on the first letter of the english word. When I switch to a german keyboard, the key stroke commands change again! I use my apple, and things are different again.<p>It does not work. A UI has to be consistent, and keyboard commands are extremely inconsistent. Look at the vim style commands and compare them to the windows style commands.<p>And another problem with keyboard commands is that there is no hint. How many people have gotten stuck in vim because the interface is not acting as expected?<p>Using a gui to shut down an App, I look for an X and press it. Using a keyboard, it could be ctrl+q, ctrl+c, ESC, :q!, Alt+F4, Alt+B (German Systems), Alt+Q (English Systems) or exit().<p>It's TERRIBLE user interface design to have so many different ways of performing the same action on the same operating system.<p>F1 works because it's always Help. The arrow keys work because they always mean the same thing. That's how keystroke commands should work: One combination, one meaning - all the time and everywhere! So when you learn that stuff, you know it.<p>I don't want to invest my time in learning app specific shortcuts for applications that I don't use that often. And that are liable to change anytime.<p>The state of keyboard control of software is broken, and has been broken for a long time.<p>My suggestion for the fix - an OLED keyboard that switches to ""command mode"" when a button is pressed. So the commands are always in the same position with all apps, all layouts, all languages and stay consistent.",1219845564

Their questions are startup related and they know a few entrepreneurs have already been through a similar situation and it makes sense to ask, but one should always consult a lawyer before making their final decision.<p>If you go to parenting site they ask questions about the best schools and those who answer are not teachers. Visit teenagers sites and you will see a lot of questions from young girls who are very confused with their bodies and want medical advices, those who answer are not doctors.",1219845459

The level of trust that I was referring to most likely does not exist between users of this site.<p>Nonetheless, I believe it is incorrect to state that one would be putting one's self in harms way by discussing legal matters with a non-lawyer, as the article implies.<p>Here's an example:  My neighbor has a large tree bordering my yard, from which a branch is hanging over the fence and interfering with my shit.  Is it legal for me to chop the branch?  Maybe in some jurisdictions, but who knows?  Should I call a lawyer right away?  Let me see what my wife thinks.<p>Me: ""Hey honey, what should I do about this branch?  Should I call a lawyer?""<p>Honey: ""A lawyer?!?!? For God's sake why would you do that?  That's just Ethel's tree.  Just cut the damn thing down.""<p>-- or --<p>""Umm, Johnny Cochrane, Jr. lives there.  Call five lawyers.""",1219845407

As far as graduate programs go, the law degree isn't really that long.  They have probably haven't had many specialized courses; their expertise will come from experience.<p>Often, the work that's done in their office is done by someone without much training at all.  You learn about business entities and how to form them in a sophomore undergraduate class.<p>But while the law can be hacked, it is rather complicated. Whether or not the person you asked had an understanding of <i>precedents</i> in your particular area would be a key factor in getting a quality response.",1219844777

287997,comment,287927,287927,0,0,biohacker42,,,"Keyboards aren't just about memory, they are a lot slower then the mouse if you don't have almost instinctive muscle memory. If you have to think what the key combo is, use the mouse.<p>Every so often I'll start thinking that maybe a keyboard + mouse combo is the fastest most efficient way to go... on Windows.<p>And then I see a windows developer for whom the keyboard has become an extension of his hands and he never touches the mouse. It's crushing to see that kind of speed and power.<p>The speed and efficiency of the keyboard isn't just a lot faster, it is so much faster that it changes the way you work.<p>But it's hard to get there, you have to find the commands, practice them, practice, practice, and all the while it would be easier to just reach for the mouse.<p>And yet I've made it a goal of mine to always get better at using the keyboard. A little bit a time, I figure I'll have no need for a mouse when I'm 80 or so.",1219844538

287985,comment,287570,287570,0,0,edw519,,,"The same thing happened at McDonald's many years ago.  You had 2 kinds of people in the building: 1 manager and 38 teenagers.  We had to figure out how to get things done with or without the manager.  The more knowledgeable (senior) employees gradually became de-facto supervisors.  Eventually, the company gave them the title ""swing manager"" and a little raise for the job they were already doing.<p>I suspect Joel's new middle managers were already well positioned for their new jobs, probably doing them already.  The recognition and extra $ are always a nice touch.<p>(Any resemblence between the way McDonald's is run today and when I was a teenager is purely coincidental.)",1219843664

BGP itself has been aggressively filtered at the AS/prefix level since the mid 90's. If there's no new vulnerability here, how are they choosing arbitrary prefixes to redirect?<p>If all they're saying is that Verizon can inject arbitrary prefixes into BGP, what's the news there? That's how routing works today. The NSA isn't capturing everyone's traffic in a room in San Francisco --- AT&T is. The NSA is just a customer. Didn't we already assume telcos could do this?

The switch to GUI has always been too expensive.  When you have 4000 users, the cost of average call times going from 2 to 4 minutes adds up quickly.<p>Make no mistake about it, for repetitve tasks, the keyboard is always faster than the mouse.  ""Alt"" and ""Ctrl"" commands are cool and geeky, but like Hank says, who can remember them all?<p>We need web apps with intuitive keyboard interfaces.  Fkeys (they're on every keyboard) and single letter commands are easily adoptable.  (Oh, you mean ""C"" brings up the Customer record, cool.)<p>The ability to do this is as old as javascript.

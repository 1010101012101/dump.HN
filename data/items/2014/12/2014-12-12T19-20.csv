8742341,comment,8741868,8742232,0,0,evincarofautumn,,,"There is a difference between “algebra with numbers” and “algebraic manipulation”. You do the latter all the time with code when you observe and use equivalences like this:<p><pre><code>    if a then

I.e., “return” is distributive over the branches of the “if” expression, so you can factor it out.<p>When you see “bad” programmers redundantly specifying Boolean expressions like “x == true” instead of “x”, it’s because they haven’t internalised the fact that “if” takes <i>any</i> algebraic expression denoting a Boolean, not just a special sort of expression with “&&” and “||” and “==” and “<”.<p>Beginning programmers often struggle with learning the elements available in a language and how they can be composed—and that is exactly what an algebra is.

8742338,comment,8735892,8740593,0,0,breuleux,,,"> This is a real hairy example IMO since it&#x27;s conflating the mechanics with optional parenthesis and dot-less method calls, but we can break it down just the same. Since Int.+ takes a single argument, then it must parse as:<p>>     1.+(_ * 2)<p>No, my point is that this is <i>not</i> how it parses. Look:<p><pre><code>    ary.map(1 + (_:Int) * 2)
    res3: Array[Int] = Array(3, 5, 7, 9, 11)
    ary.map(1.+((_:Int) * 2))
    error: overloaded method value + with alternatives:
      (Double)Double
      ...
</code></pre>
In the first case, the parser lifts _ over $times AND over $plus. The function is being lifted over <i>both</i> of them. The optional parentheses break the feature if you insert them: &quot;1.+(_ * 2)&quot; tries to add one to a function, which is not a valid operation.<p>>> how much of the context does it grab along with it?<p>> None. In this position, it&#x27;s the beginning of an expression. It doesn&#x27;t escape the scope it&#x27;s defined in. Just like in the 1.+(_ * 2) example, what comes before it doesn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s the beginning of an expression.<p>If that was true, then &quot;1 + _ * 2&quot; would be invalid, and &quot;f(_)(1)&quot; would be equivalent to &quot;f(1)&quot;. But the former is valid and the latter doesn&#x27;t work like that.<p>> I was going to attempt to write a Ruby analogue, but I can&#x27;t actually figure out a clean way to do that.<p>There is a limited Python analogue:<p><a href=""https://github.com/kachayev/fn.py#scala-style-lambdas-definition"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kachayev/fn.py#scala-style-lambdas-defini...</a><p>That only works insofar that the _ placeholder object can seize control over the expression, so &quot;f(_, 2)&quot; won&#x27;t work unless f explicitly handles _. Implementing the full feature would require language or macro support, but my point was more that a new dynamic language could trivially support it.",1418414177

If anything, this will just make the problem worse by enabling people to consume even more food, and probably end up putting on more weight, especially since it seems that most causes of obesity are psychological (unconscious eating, eating past satiety, bad food choices, etc). Also, if some of the comments here are to be believed, this drug will just treat the symptom of obesity and not the cause (eg, processed food, BPA, etc).<p>I do think this research could have great applications into life extension, or helping people feel younger, but my money is on this drug not having any noticeable effect on the obese population.",1418412901

So now you&#x27;ll see people who are fundamentally anti-science use scientific arguments on, say, climate change.<p>But nuclear power, GMO food crops, and geoengineering are none-the-less dead issues for the modern environmental movement because about half of that movement is not interested in the science of whether or not those things are on balance good: they are ultimate expressions of the un-natural modernity that that half of the movement wants to get rid of.  They aren&#x27;t being irrational, and they aren&#x27;t just waiting to hear the right argument for why nuclear power is less likely to provoke a catastrophe that will lead to the loss of human life than the status quo.  They are opposed to nuclear power per se, for what it inherently is, not for the specific effects it will have on humans or particular animals or anything.<p>This isn&#x27;t going to change unless the current big tent breaks up, and it&#x27;s not clear that, like, scientific environmentalism has enough political clout to pass any part of its agenda if the current tent does break up.<p>Edit:  To make it more explicit, there are people within the environmental movement who prefer solar and wind power to fossil fuels, and fossil fuels to nuclear, not because they believe that the damage to current living things goes renewable < fossil < nuclear, but rather because the sun and the wind go on around us all the time even in a state of pure nature, and we&#x27;re just redirecting the energy a little with windmills and solar cells, whereas fossil fuels are in a state of nature sitting around underground and should remain there, but at least they are in and of themselves natural objects, whereas nuclear power creates isotopes and elements that simply do not exist in any measurable quantity in a state of nature.

A Q-network can be trained by minimising a sequence of loss functions Li(θi) that changes at each iteration i,
L_i (θ_i) = E_s,a∼ρ(·)[(y_i − Q (s, a; θ_i))^2]&quot;<p>I get to a place like this and I really have to stop and let it process.  Ok, theta is the set of weights for the network function approximator. L_i is the loss function at i, wait. what is rho? something about expected return. Wait, what is y? Oh, ok, it&#x27;s just E_s∼E [r + γ max_a&#x27; ; Q(s&#x27;, a&#x27;; θ_i−1)|s, a] ok, so that&#x27;s I guess the equation before this one with respect to those weights for the previous iteration. So I guess that minus the square of the function approximator based on the weights of the current iteration?  Oh, wait it says rho(s,a) is the behavior distribution or the probability distirirbution over s and a.<p>So I guess I kind of get the point of the loss function? I think it estimates some difference between the approximated expectation of the current iteration and the approximated expectation where it should be after the previous iteration?<p>I guess I wonder if there are other people, even people who study in the same domain who can read a paper like that and just understand the formulas more easily than if it were explained a bit more in English.<p>I mean, I don&#x27;t typically work with machine learning, and it&#x27;s been a long while since I&#x27;ve been in Academia, but even when I was an undergrad, the formulas that I used were mostly done because I felt that good papers include confusing formulas.  They were always valid and important, but presenting as little as necessary almost seemed like a challenge to other people, to show how I was smarter than them.  But it also meant when I read papers by peers even though I knew what all the parts meant I still had to sit down and think through the formulas when they were shown.<p>I don&#x27;t mean that this is the intention of this paper.  But especially since I&#x27;m not very familiar with conventions when talking about artificial neural networks and machine learning it&#x27;s especially apparent how challenging it is to understand, but once I do sort through the jargon and process the intent, I start to understand it.<p>I guess I just wonder whether someone reasonably familiar with the subject matter can read those things without issue (in which case, that&#x27;s great, because that&#x27;s the intended audience) or whether authors could communicate their point more clearly in English, and use the formulas more as reference or proof.  Or whether it was kind of like me, and they like to leave it to the reader as a sort of &quot;if it takes you a while to get it, that&#x27;s your problem, we&#x27;re smarter.&quot;<p>My guess is that it could be communicated more clearly, and that it&#x27;s more a result of academic style than anything else.

We&#x27;d lose variability in holidays that are &quot;last Thursday of the month&quot;: they&#x27;d just be on a specific date every year.<p>One nice thing we&#x27;d gain is that the phase of the moon would shift much slower with respect to our calendar (the moon doesn&#x27;t do a Year Day).

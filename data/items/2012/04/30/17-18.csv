That is, the <i>effectiveness</i> of the medicines would be very different, but the actual substances available in some way would barely be different.<p>With the exception of marijuana, almost every drug with medicinal use is either available medically in <i>some</i> form <i>or</i> unavailable, but with very related 'cousins' readily available.<p>Marijuana is available as Marinol - it just doesn't work, because it's synthesized without the full set of ~70 cannabinoids. MDMA isn't available (outside of very restricted research), but it's closely related to methamphetamine, which is available with a prescription. (People are often surprised to hear that one). GHB is available with a prescription. Heroin is really just a synthesized and concentrated form of morphine (available with prescription), and peyote is available for some religious ceremonies. [Psilocybin is not, but oddly enough, I believe mushroom spores are legal, even though the mushrooms are not (because the spores don't contain any psylocybin - I believe this may depend on your jurisdiction, though, and as always, IANAL.).]<p>So what's the end result? We've criminalized drugs not based on their underlying chemistry - there is almost no Schedule I drug that doesn't have a closely related (and oftentimes <i>identical</i>!) counterpart in Schedules II-IV or not scheduled at all.<p>If I were the conspiracy-theory type, I'd say that this is a way of saying that drugs can only be useful if a pharmaceutical company is profiting off of it. Though I'm inclined to side with Hanlon's razor on this one - that's not really how it came about historically, even if 'Big Pharma' does benefit off of it now.

3910420,comment,3909666,3909666,13,0,johnhartigun,,,"Below is excerpt from <i>23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism</i>.<p>Summary: Since 1980s, the decision power in US corporations started to move to the hands of shareholders. They care about short term profits, not about the employees.<p>> And then, in the 1980s, the holy grail was found. It was called the principle of shareholder value maximization. It was argued that professional managers should be rewarded according to the amount they can give to shareholders. In order to achieve this, it was argued, first <i>profits need to be maximized by ruthlessly cutting costs  wage bills, investments, inventories, middle-level managers, and so on</i>. Second, the highest possible share of these profits needs tobe distributed to the shareholders  through dividends and share buybacks. In order to encourage managers to behave in this way, the proportion of their compensation packages that stock options account for needs to be increased, so that they identify more with the interests of the shareholders. The idea was advocated not just by shareholders, but also by many professional managers, most famously by Jack Welch, the long-time chairman of General Electric (GE), who is often credited with coining the term shareholder value in aspeech in 1981.<p>> Soon after Welchs speech, shareholder value maximization became the zeitgeist of the American corporate world. In the beginning, it seemed to work really well for both the managers and the shareholders. The shareof profits in national income, which had shown a downward trend since the 1960s, sharply rose in the mid 1980s and has shown an upward trend since then.\nAnd the shareholders got a higher share of that profit as dividends, while seeing the value of their shares rise. Distributed profits as a share of total US corporate profit stood at 3545 per cent between the 1950s and the 1970s, but it has been onan upward trend since the late 70s and now stands at around 60 per cent. The managers saw their compensation rising through the roof, but shareholders stopped questioning their pay packages, as they were happy with ever-rising share prices and dividends. The practice soon spread to other countries  more easily to countries like Britain, which had a corporate power structure and managerial culture similar to those of the US, and less easily to other countries, as we shall see below<p>> Now, this unholy alliance between the professional managers and the shareholders was all financed by squeezing the other stakeholders in the company (which is why it has spread much more slowly to other rich countries where the other stakeholders have greater relative strength). <i>Jobs were ruthlessly cut, many workers were fired and re-hired as non-unionized labour with lower wages and fewer benefits, and wage increases were suppressed</i> (often by relocating to or outsourcing from low-wage countries, suchas China and India  or the threat to do so). The suppliers, and their workers, were also squeezed by continued cuts in procurement prices, while the government was pressured into lowering corporate tax rates and/or providing more subsidies, with the help of the threat of relocating to countries with lower corporate tax rates and/or higher business subsidies. As a result, income inequality soared and in a seemingly endless corporate boom (ending, of course, in 2008), the vast majority of the American and the British populations could share in the (apparent) prosperity only through borrowing atunprecedented rates.",1335808639

3910413,comment,3909691,3910330,1,0,beagle3,,,"> I often see groups of farmers, homeowners, small business owners, or whatever forming groups to lobby congress for their own benefit.<p>And how successful are they, compared to corporations? The problem is that by lobbying clout making a difference, corporations are thousands of times more effective than the number of people they represent.<p>(And it's usually an accepted deduction for them, unlike most other groups)<p>> Likewise, when a person devotes some small fraction of their resources to tax avoidance and a corporation devotes the same fraction, the corporation's results are going to be much more impressive and complex than the persons. But I'm not sure that's a reason to condemn the one and not the other.<p>The answer you're going to get as a person if you do that (especially if you get creative with multinational tricks) is ""I'm not sure I'll be able to defend that in court. And if I can't, you're going to jail"". However, if you do it as a corporation, the worst you'd do is to pay back taxes (perhaps with some small penalty). Sarbanes Oxley theoretically makes the CEO personally liable, but I haven't heard of a case where one was prosecuted that wasn't downright fraud.<p>Do you know of any case in which a corporate executive faced personal liability for creative tax planning? I do know cases where persons creatively planning their own taxes faced such liability. And I think that makes it good enough reason to single out one and not the other.",1335808563

That's kind of surprising! I would have thought a profitable niche would have to be a bit more specialized by now... I guess the NDK hasn't been out all that long.<p>A lot of ""Android"" developers are actually Java developers who are trying to cash in on mobile. Serious game developers almost all use the NDK, but serious game developers are in high demand (myself included). So yes, NDK is itself a niche, in that the number of jobs seems to exceed the number of developers available.<p>On the other hand, by being able to do games in NDK I'm even better off, but just being good at NDK development is pretty powerful. Keep in mind that you also have to deal with Java and the Android stack -- you can't do everything in the NDK. So you need to be someone good at C++ who also can get around in Java.",1335808558

Similarly to what Agile/XP did for the software development sector. Instead of having managers and CxOs make all the decisions, allow the people closest to the situation, with all the facts, make the decision and be responsible for that decision. Create small teams that are self organizing and imbue those teams with the power to truly own and produce the solution to the problems that they face and are trying to solve.<p>I personally feel that the main problem with organizations and employee happiness and retention is the current system of command and control where all employees are assumed to be idiots that need to be micro-managed. How is anyone suppose to be happy in that kind of environment? Work should not be an extension of school where we store and manage people in order to keep them out of trouble until they are old enough to retire. No, work should be a place where people want to go because they know that they own a little bit of that business and are really responsible for its success and/or failure.",1335808419

After all, it's the cost to launch a replacement. (Notice my $50k figure included the cost of parts for our backup flight unit plus the launch costs.)<p>I think you're right that automated factories in space will reduce the actual launch costs (just the cost of getting your junk into space). The rest of the cost reduction has to come from reducing the cost of manufacturing. Accepting additional risk can certainly help here. That's a big change of mindset for the aerospace industry.<p>In my example, the cost of materials and manufacturing was a fraction of the actual launch cost. I don't think that's typically the case for traditional spacecraft, but I'm not positive about that. Adding more or heavier parts increases the mass, which requires more energy from the launch vehicle to reach orbit. I find it entirely plausible that adding redundancy increases launch costs as well as manufacturing costs, but I don't know how the big boys arrange their launch costs. (At PolySat, our satellites were so small that we paid per kilogram. Other satellites can be the size of a van or even a school bus.)<p>I think 20 years is a bit optimistic for space-based factories to reach the point where we can dramatically lower the costs of launching a spacecraft. I think a kilogram of aluminum mined in space and a kilogram of aluminum mined on Earth would not be fungible, and would thus have very different costs. Initially, I think the aluminum available at the space-based factory would cost significantly more than ground-based aluminum. (The company that builds the factories will have to recoup their costs, as will the companies that mine the raw materials. And at least initially, they're going to be paying to launch those spacecraft from Earth.) Eventually, we could reach a scale that the cost of materials in space is low enough to seriously discount traditional launch costs. I just think there's a lot more than 20 years of work to get there.",1335807829

And while they might only be, say, 5% of the population, they vastly outnumber the outlaws for which these regulations were made.<p>e.g., if you have control of any asset outside the US, you can spend weeks trying to satisfy the documentation and tax requirements, and still fail because they are ambiguously worded. And you are automatically assumed to be in the wrong and avoiding taxation, even if you overpaid. How is that for simple? That is regardless of any deduction you may or may not be able to take.<p>> However, getting rid of the Irish structure would require (a) a change in other countries' tax policies or (b) a tax code even more complicated than the one we have right now.<p>Neither is true. The tax code for persons already enforces that - no matter how many entities you have in the middle, if you are ultimately in control of a company or a bank account, you have to report it and pay taxes on the profits.<p>It just takes the addition of one clause ""Company X pays US taxes on every cent it makes in itself or a company under its control (in proportion to said control, ultimately determined by agency). Violation of this is considered lying under oath w.r.t sarbanes oaxley reporting""<p>(or 10 in legalese, with this underlying meaning), and all of a sudden it becomes the company's issue to prove it is not in control if it doesn't want to pay taxes.

At some point, whatever language it's written in would be non-native on most of the OSes, so you'd have to port something one way or the other (Python has a fairly <i>nice</i> port that abstracts away some of the warts, but it's still just serving as a pseudo-agnostic interface). Given that, why not sh? It's already been ported to Windows (I've never used Cygwin, but it seems like it'd be a useful starting point), and virtually every other OS is either Unix-like or supports some native POSIX-like interface for compatibility reasons.<p>If you're complaining about sh syntax, I'm a bit sympathetic toward that, but it's ingrained enough - and good enough - that I wouldn't go to the effort of replacing it. Also remember that, for shell scripting, you <i>don't want</i> a language as powerful as Python - it needs to be able to do a very small set of simple tasks and do them well.<p>Also, just think about concurrency.

In turn, this meant that the shareholders received fewer credits along with their dividends, meaning in turn that they had to pay more tax. The net result is that each tax break a corporation itself got was countered by a matching increase in the tax burden of shareholders, leaving shareholders in exactly the same position had no tax break been received by the corporation.

3910205,comment,3909703,3909703,7,0,drostie,,,"You asked ""how does it work?"" so let me answer that. How it works:<p>Okay, so the black arrows represent adding one, and the white arrows represent multiplying by ten. The circle that you see represents the fact that after we hit 7 when adding by one, we ""loop around"" to 0 again, because 7 has remainder 0 when divided by 7.<p>So we are constructing (in their example) 325 by saying:<p><pre><code>    Instruction     | Number | Remainder\n    start with 0.   |    0   |  0\n    add 3.          |    3   |  3\n    multiply by 10. |   30   |  2\n    add 2.          |   32   |  4\n    multiply by 10. |  320   |  5\n    add 5.          |  325   |  3\n</code></pre>\nNow the only thing you really need to know is that ""multiply by 10"" is only a function of the current remainder, it can never depend on the rest of the digits we've processed before in any other way.<p>To see this, just write out the number. The number is 7 k + r for some remainder r. Multiplying by 10 produces 70k + 10 r. Taking the remainder when you divide by 7 is just... (10 r) % 7, because the first term is divisible by 7. So you only need to keep track of the remainder.<p>In fact, 10 r is really 7r + 3r, and the 7r is also divisible by 7, which means that the white arrows really just multiply by 3. That is why 0 maps to 0, 1 maps to 3, 2 maps to 6, and 3 maps to 9 % 7 == 2.",1335806161

You're going to (want to) host other websites that can grow big and will catch a lot of wind. Although there is no direct revenue for you Pastie.Org was good practice for this it seems also this wasn't a sudden problem (you yourself indicate here that the problem was slowly growing) so this should be no factor in the decision to terminate the hosting so suddenly. Of course if it's more hassle than it's worth you and Pastie can come to an agreement (like stopping next month) but it now sounds like that decision should've been made months earlier or not yet at all.<p>- Although it's extremely hard to protect yourself from DDOS attacks you've now openly indicated that you're vulnerable and that you will drop things you are committed to do if there is some pressure in order to save the rest of your customers. This will make other customers nervous since they can now be easily threatened and might even go down for the fun of it (I personally don't think it's fun but some people apparently do)<p>- Even though pastie.org was not generating any revenue and was not a 'customer' you still had a commitment to them and tbh it looks pretty bad that you've one-sidedly decided in an instant to break that commitment, this is really costing you cred.<p>Of course what's done is done now, but I just wanted to voice my opinion in this debate.

Once, when asking about what I should do with my life, he said something that made a lot of sense. It sort of went like this:<p>""Think about what you want to have a whole lot of laying around and do that."" He had a car lot and repair shop because he liked having a lot of cars. His collection of british sports cars was unbelieveable. Not because he was loaded, but because he was immersed in cars 24/7 and when a deal came up, people would call him. He said, ""You want a lot of nice furniture? sell furniture. You want awesome computers? work on computers. You want a lot of jewelry and random crap? open a pawn shop. you want women? sell shoes.""<p>I, being 15, said, ""That all sounds great, but what I want is a lot of money.""<p>He said, ""It's the exact same thing. Work in venture capital or finance. You're immersed in money. When good deals come up, people will call you. I own 73 cars because that's what I do so I'm surrounded by other guys who do car deals, too. If you work in money, you'll have cash laying around because that's what you and everyone you work with will do.""<p>I wound up choosing code instead and, yep, i'm awash with code and algorithms and surrounded by people who can make computers do real things.

Third, you describe how you can do aggregation 45 million times per second on a single core.... woo fast addition.

These factories profit by producing things invented by people who most likely don't take any part in the ownership of the factory.<p>The difference between these types of people (the merchants, builders, etc.) and the Pirate Bay is that the merchants give a portion of their profit back to the people that they are profiting off of. The Pirate Bay does not pay a single penny to the owners of the music that they dispense.",1335805422

In practice, the US federal government these days borrows 30% of the money it spends; the percentage has been growing through the years.<p>If they paid their fair share of taxes, then either (a) the government would borrow less -- or, more likely (b) the government would spend more (and the population in general you may or may not be the beneficiary).<p>The ""if you pay less taxes I pay more taxes"" only works in a closed system.

The discussion is about the hundreds of billions in aggregate that corporations and the wealthy are not paying.<p>And we certainly aren't seeing hundreds of billions in Gates-style charity from corporations and the other super-wealthy.<p>Consider also that Gates fabulous charity is still <i>small</i> compared to the aggregate donation of Americans.  His charity is notable only for having come from a single person and for his ability to therefore set priorities directly.  It's not remotely clear that aggregated wealth, even if it were to <i>always</i> result in Gates'-style donations, results in more net charity than if it were taxed, spent and thus diffused back into the economy where the rest of America might earn it and donate to charity in smaller individual amounts.<p>Government tax revenue, after all, does not get <i>destroyed</i>.  It gets spent. Perhaps inefficiently, but spent nonetheless.  And say what you will about cronyism, you'd quickly find yourself in the rhetorical weeds if you tried to argue that wealth generated off government inefficiency or misdirected priority is somehow tainted and thus can't be expected to produce charity from those who make their living from it.  Not when a cursory glance over government revenue flows creates a list of the largest US government contractors and vendors that looks almost <i>exactly</i> like the list of corporations and wealthy individuals we're trying to excuse for their charity.<p>(Edit: cleaned up some phrasing)",1335805394

See for yourself:<p>""Consciousness - The having of perceptions, thoughts, and feelings; awareness. The term is impossible to define except in terms that are unintelligible without a grasp of what consciousness means. Many fall into the trap of equating consciousness with self-consciousnessto be conscious it is only necessary to be aware of the external world. Consciousness is a fascinating but elusive phenomenon: it is impossible to specify what it is, what it does, or why it has evolved. Nothing worth reading has been written on it.""<p>""The most compelling argument for the existence of consciousness is that the vast majority of mankind have an overwhelming intuition that there truly is such a thing.[20] Skeptics argue that this intuition, in spite of its compelling quality, is false, either because the concept of consciousness is intrinsically incoherent, or because our intuitions about it are based in illusions. Gilbert Ryle, for example, argued that traditional understanding of consciousness depends on a Cartesian dualist outlook that improperly distinguishes between mind and body, or between mind and world. He proposed that we speak not of minds, bodies, and the world, but of individuals, or persons, acting in the world. Thus, by speaking of 'consciousness' we end up misleading ourselves by thinking that there is any sort of thing as consciousness separated from behavioral and linguistic understandings.[21] More generally, many philosophers and scientists have been unhappy about the difficulty of producing a definition that does not involve circularity or fuzziness.[17]""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness</a><p>So, I don't find the word very useful.",1335805266

112037,comment,111499,111578,0,0,nkohari,,,"I came into C# by way of C/C++, so I had a slight advantage. That being said, I found the .NET base class library very easy to pick up because of IntelliSense in Visual Studio. You don't really need to know the entire BCL to program in C#, though. I've used it for years and I still don't know every single piece. (That's another reason why I said to avoid the MS certification materials like the plague; they just teach the BCL and not really the language fundamentals.)<p>I think C# teaches the fundamentals of programming pretty readily -- variables, types, functions, loops, objects, etc. Because dynamic languages are vastly more expressive, those concepts aren't as readily obvious. C# also masks some of the more difficult concepts from C-family languages, like pointers and memory allocation, meaning you can get your app running without saying ""what the hell is a segmentation fault?"" :)<p>Because the OP said he/she was working with a .NET/Java programmer, and asking about .NET, I naturally inferred that the project was written in .NET. I think it's even MORE difficult to learn a language (say Python) and then try to translate the abstract concepts into .NET-speak. Experienced programmers can hop between languages, but I recall trying to do that with GW-BASIC and C when I knew GW-BASIC and was learning C, and it was a royal pain.<p>(That may have something to do with the level of functionality available in GW-BASIC vs. C, but I digress... :)<p>Generally speaking, though, I would suggest Python as a good language to learn when starting out. I wouldn't, on the other hand, suggest Ruby as a language for people who haven't programmed before. When you consider the basic language features you need to learn in order to grasp the language, C# is much simpler than Ruby.<p>Before you flame me to a crisp, I'm not saying C# or Python are BETTER than Ruby. Ruby is an amazing tool once you grasp its complexities (and it's my new favorite language). I've got to think it'd be difficult for a newcomer to pick up things like blocks, dynamic dispatch, mutable types, hash parameters without braces, etc.",1202478412

112035,comment,111956,111956,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I'm guessing that very few people here on news.yc are qualified to compose the Cobol Challenge: the problem for which Cobol is uniquely qualified to provide the elegant solution.<p>Of course, the budget and the legacy code will have to be a very explicit part of that problem.<p>Meanwhile, this Erlang Challenge only tends to emphasize my impression -- which is just a stereotype, really -- that Erlang is <i>certainly not</i> the hundred-year language: it's a special-purpose language that is brilliant at a narrow class of problem. I'm convinced that, if I have some process that I want to spread across half a million processor cores, I should ask my company's Erlang guru to work on it (because, come on, if you can afford half a million processor cores you can afford at least one Erlang guru). What I'm not yet convinced of is that a world with N programmers who work in general-purpose languages needs more than (0.005)N Erlang gurus.<p>The challenge of the Erlang advocate is not to convince me, over and over, that Erlang wins its class; the challenge is to convince me that Erlang's class of problem is so important to my life that I should study Erlang rather than vascular surgery, or television repair, or other obscure technical skills that I don't know that much about.",1202478317

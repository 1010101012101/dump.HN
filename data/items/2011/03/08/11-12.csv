In doing that, you're purposefully confusing the lawmaking and judiciary parts of the legal system to create an imagined body which you creatively name the ""Eurocracy"", while this was a court decision independent of those actually making the law. In short, your intention was to rant, using this ruling as an excuse, and not to provide potentially interesting information.<p>As for the ruling itself, I don't see what's wrong with it. It's gender discrimination, and gender discrimination is (IMO rightly) unlawful. I have never been in a car accident, I'm a careful and relatively safe driver and I don't appreciate having to pay more just because I happen to be male.<p>I'm sure you can come up with statistics that show people of a certain ethnicity are more likely to be in an accident too, but insurance companies know that's a no-go. Discriminating by gender is exactly the same; it's based on something you <i>are</i> that you <i>can't change</i>, unlike driving experience and where you live which you can.",1299585541

The reason is because Last.FM is in the corporate doldrums, and since Last.FM got acquired a few fundamental things happened: Facebook & Twitter. \nLast.FM has little to no integration with these services, seriously, imagine a social service in 2011 that entirely ignores these networks.<p>I love Last.FM, I have been a user for over 5 years (<a href=""http://www.last.fm/user/Hejog"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.last.fm/user/Hejog</a>) but I am infuriated to no end at the lack of innovation.<p>Last.FM has forgotten its roots of being a startup, and in this process lost the one thing products need to relentlessly focus on - delighting users. If Like.FM can focus on that, they will beat Last.FM.<p>The major roadblock with beating Last.FM is that their API is a very defensible beachhead - I refuse to use music services that do not scrobble, as data is worthless if you only see 90% of your listening habits.<p>Chris needs to run around SV and convince everyone to let him integrate his APIs with their music service.

This is tricky, especially since you can't see the target. In Angry Birds you aim by pointing in the direction you want to launch the bird.<p>A slight error in the timing of the trebuchet launch easily turns your shot into a complete miss.<p>Angry Birds does introduce timing later, with the various types of birds whose behavior changes with a tap while in flight, but that generally occurs when the bird is close to the target where a slight error usually doesn't completely waste the bird.<p>The net result is that in Angry Birds I feel like I'm spending most of my effort concentrating on how best to attack the puzzle of understanding the physics of the level so as to efficiently get through it. In CTC I'm concentrating on the reflex game of clicking at the right point in the trebuchet swing. The former is simply a much more engaging game.<p>PS: I disagree that CTC is not about killing the people. There are levels with people outside the castle. Take down the castle but leave some of those people alive, and the level is not over. Killing the people is the victory condition, so I'd say the game is about killing the people.",1299584621

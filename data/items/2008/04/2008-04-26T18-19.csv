174448,comment,174393,174393,0,0,gruseom,,,"This is a nice piece about debugging in the light of scientific methods (and vice versa). One detail, though:<p><i>The idea goes back to Francis Bacon, who, using modern CS terminology three hundred years ahead of time, called it a ""conditional inductive tree"".</i><p>This is an anachronism. There's no way Bacon or anybody else used the phrase ""conditional inductive tree"" in 17th century English. Bacon may have anticipated the idea, but the phrase itself, and that way of formulating it, are modern constructs.<p>Edit: by ""that way of formulating it"" I mean the idea of a conditional tree with branches as alternatives. It would be interesting to know the origins of the logical tree metaphor and how it evolved as part of logic/CS.",1209235794

That makes some investors here a bit conservative since ""the proven model"" is so unambitious.  But there are VCs and Angels here in town and quite a few startups.  Living is freakishly cheap for a European metropolis and in general it's a very attractive place to live.<p>Here's a map of startups registered on Deutsche Startups:<p><a href=""http://www.deutsche-startups.de/2007/11/29/berlin-ist-die-startup-hauptstadt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deutsche-startups.de/2007/11/29/berlin-ist-die-st...</a>",1209234940

174440,comment,174107,174199,0,0,maximilian,,,"If you haven't learned anything in 2 years, you are being a lazy bastard and not applying yourself.  First, you should have gone and talked to your advisor, and been like: ""Look, i'm bored as shit in these intro courses, can I jump ahead?"".  He'd be like sure, take this class, its super hard from what I hear.  Then you'd be set.  There is so much shit to be learned at school.  If you know so much already, try to do some research for a prof.  Or setup your own research course so that you can research your own shit.<p>Also, bitching about general ed requirements is also a copout.  You usually don't have to take psych 101 to fulfill requirements.  Any 200+ level class will be much more challenging and interesting.  You just have to have the balls to take higher level coursework.",1209234550

174438,comment,174359,174420,0,0,cperciva,,,"One way of looking at it is this: Does the plugin make sense without the context of the program which calls it?<p>This viewpoint has been used by some hardware companies with respect to their linux drivers -- they start by writing a FreeBSD driver, and then port that driver to linux.  The FreeBSD driver (which contains all the details which they want to keep secret) is obviously not a ""derived work"" of linux, so this keeps them safe from any arguments about GPL taint.",1209234344

174436,comment,174331,174331,0,0,maximilian,,,"This article is ridiculous.  It just bitches about the drop down menu and other random stuff.  I just took a look at the checkout process.  Since I already buy stuff from Amazon from time to time, my info is all stored once I'm logged in.  Once i'm in the purchase page I just have to click ""Place Order"".  The purchasing page is separate from the normal amazon page, but I would never have noticed.  I would say that its really not a big deal that once you click ""Checkout"" that it takes you to a separate page.  I for one, don't click checkout unless I mean to with the items I have.  And if I did have second thoughts its super easy to get rid of them or back out.<p>And honestly, if there UI design was that flawed, as the guy says, they wouldn't be a profitable company because they rely on purchase volume, which if not super easy, wouldn't happen.",1209234085

For example, zlib.h on Mountain Lion is 80511 bytes, but only 22031 bytes when gzip compressed (around half the size of Turbo Pascal).<p>The article's tone implies that these were the 'good old days' when compilers were small and fast. However, priorities have rightly changed. We now have computers that can execute billions of operations per second without breaking a sweat, I/O devices which can perform tens of thousands of IOPS, and laptop GPUs that can push 3D content to a 5.1 million pixel display. It's likely that Turbo Pascal was highly optimized to deal with the constraint's of that day's computers. A lot of developer man hours were almost certainly allocated to shaving off extra bytes from the executable. It's usually not worth devoting such man hours to tiny performance improvements, considering the beefy hardware most people have.",1349023465

It's just that it usually worked and the new one usually doesn't. I'm in greater Washington DC, I'm sure your mileage will vary.)<p>The same can be said for Waze -- I often would convert a descriptive location (such as ""San Francisco International"" per another post) to a street address then copy and paste it into Waze. I use the conditional tense because I consider the new iOS Maps app to be superior to Waze for navigation, once you've found an address.<p>It seems to me Apple could easily cut a deal with a third-party-search-engine-that-isn't-Google to improve this simple flaw.<p><a href=""http://loewald.com/blog/?p=4918"" rel=""nofollow"">http://loewald.com/blog/?p=4918</a>",1349020948

Why bother doing both? If it's just to attract attention, that's a reasonably valid reason -- but it probably has the opposite of the desired effect, people get annoyed that they can't view the code now, and therefore start disliking the contest in general.<p>2) Even when the code is released, the format they use makes it difficult to actually look at the code. Let's take the 2011 winners for example [1]. One would assume that clicking each entry (e.g., the top entry[2]) would perhaps show the code, perhaps annotated in a useful way... nope! Surely it must link to the code then... nope! Perhaps it links to a page that links to the code... nope!<p>You have to go to the 'Winning Entries' page from the main menu (from [1]), scroll down to the appropriate year, then play a fun game of matching up entrant's surnames to their entries (yes, I know the surname is in the URL of [2]).<p>[ 3) While not a 'real' complaint: the I-just-learned-how-to-use-a-3D-modelling-program logo really is awful. It makes the contest look juvenile, when in fact the quality of the winning entries is very high. The site looks much better without the logo -- try it yourself, delete the img node from the homepage using Inspector/Firebug/whatever. ]<p>In conclusion: show us the code, delete the logo :).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ioccc.org/2011/whowon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ioccc.org/2011/whowon.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ioccc.org/2011/blakely/hint.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ioccc.org/2011/blakely/hint.html</a>",1349020910

When a consumer hears the pitch -- in the case of Columbia House, it was ""get 8 CDs for 1 penny"", in the case of JustFab it's ""get any pair of shoes for $39"" -- they should be asking what the catch is.  An ungodly number of businesses involve catches to survive.  How about cell phones?  That new iPhone is only $200... but you have a 2 year contract and a $400 fee for leaving early.<p>Columbia House and the Columbia Record Club were around for 60 years.

Copyrighted works are a multi-billion dollar industry. They&#x27;re also extremely, one-sided laws thanks to lobbying by big companies that own most of the I.P. (esp profitable). So, when conversation comes up, it makes no sense to act like it&#x27;s Joe Public vs The Little Guy given that the laws are mainly designed to benefit The Big Companies.<p>So, the question is, should my work and company have to keep innovating to earn at or above the market rate while a select few get 100+ year monopolies on their work? I think not.<p>Further, your employment contract reply is a strawman that doesn&#x27;t reflect America&#x27;s situation. People are typically hired by a company with either no contract or a contract written by the company for the company&#x27;s benefit. Laws, passed again with corruption, often grant the company the I.P. if the slightest bit was done on their time. Other laws let the companies throw away employees without consequence. The result is that the labor market is rigged highly in favor of big companies and their lawyers with supply-and-demand lowering the wages of workers each year.<p>Except big companies with a nice selection of copyrights, patents, and other legal monopolies. ;) So, it&#x27;s worthwhile to ask whether we should continue giving monopolies that mainly benefit richest few and were largely created via corruption. I&#x27;m opposed to it as I think artists will create regardless. I&#x27;m for models more like Patreon or non-profits behind software.",1445702274

So any heuristics to identify ubnormal/dangerous activity and take an action by decreasing attacker chances like rate limiting/captchas and so on.<p><pre><code>  * If you see one IP trying to login with incorrect creds with really high rate - then it&#x27;s probably attack.\n  * If you see really lots of IPs trying to crack specific user account at the same time - then it&#x27;s probably attack.\n</code></pre>\nInstead of that I can see the opposite practice: service set draconian password politics, but just allow requests with incorrect credentials without any limits: &quot;30req/sec? You&#x27;re welcome, buddy! Need an API maybe?&quot;<p>I can suspect something like this happened before:<p>&quot;It looks like a lot of work with rate limiting and all the stuff, let&#x27;s just force our users to set 10+ character passwords with one+ capital letter, one+ number, one+ special character&quot;.\nOh, and in these examples there is usually cherry on cake like:<p><pre><code>  - Dev1: &quot;Let&#x27;s not allow 2 same characters or 3 characters of same type&quot;\n  - Dev2: &quot;Let&#x27;s also force our users to change their passwords every 3 months&quot;\n  - CEO: &quot;Brilliant ideas!

How much of that 40% is rare edge cases or similar, such that in reality the behaviour of the code doesn&#x27;t change in practice?<p>The follow-up email raises this exact point, noting that in the specific example of pointer overflow:<p><i>In executions where overflow does not happen, the gcc produced binary will match the behavior of the abstract machine in the C spec.</i><p>Which means that the cited static analysis, while correctly identifying code containing UB, may not actually have an issue at runtime as the condition may never occur in practice.<p>The real problem is any software that truly relies on undefined behaviour for correct operation (which, I&#x27;ll bet, is far less than the 40% cited here).

For example, by combining the meanings of\n    “bite,” “dog,” and “man,” we can think about a dog biting a man,\n    or a man biting a dog. Here, in two functional magnetic resonance\n    imaging (fMRI) experiments using multivoxel pattern\n    analysis (MVPA), we identify a region of left mid-superior\n    temporal cortex (lmSTC) that flexibly encodes “who did what to\n    whom” in visually presented sentences. We find that lmSTC\n    represents the current values of abstract semantic\n    variables (“Who did it?” and “To whom was it done?”) in distinct\n    subregions. Experiment 1 first identifies a broad region of lmSTC\n    whose activity patterns (i) facilitate decoding of\n    structure-dependent sentence meaning (“Who did what to whom?”)\n    and (ii) predict affect-related amygdala responses that depend on\n    this information (e.g., “the baby kicked the grandfather”\n    vs. “the grandfather kicked the baby”). Experiment 2 then\n    identifies distinct, but neighboring, subregions of lmSTC whose\n    activity patterns carry information about the identity of the\n    current “agent” (“Who did it?”) and the current “patient” (“To\n    whom was it done?”). These neighboring subregions lie along the\n    upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus and the lateral bank\n    of the superior temporal gyrus, respectively. At a high level,\n    these regions may function like topographically defined data\n    registers, encoding the fluctuating values of abstract semantic\n    variables. This functional architecture, which in key respects\n    resembles that of a classical computer, may play a critical role\n    in enabling humans to flexibly generate complex thoughts.</code></pre>",1445700145

Cognitive-behavioral therapy and dialectical behavioral therapy have been proven to be effective for treating numerous biologically based mental disorders. They are not even slightly based on Freudian models.<p>For many cases it is more effective than medication or boosts the efficacy of pharmacological intervention.<p>Therapy is an appropriate tool for treating biological conditions. Patients with OCD, whose brain structure is visibly altered because it is a biological condition, respond surprisingly well to CBT and Exposure-Response Prevention based therapy. It is the recommended first line of treatment for the disease [1].<p>As someone who suffered from OCD, along with depression and anxiety, therapy is a successful way to adapt and overcome diseases that are firmly rooted in biological origins. I experience a vastly improved quality of life than I did years ago. Of course this is an anecdote, but the research backs up the my claims of efficacy.<p>Given that these diseases affect a network of neurons, learning to adapt to structural, biological or learned abnormalities in the network is crucial.<p>A study on CBT[2] and depression came to an interesting conclusion:<p><i>The evidence shows that that CT [cognitive therapy] is as efficacious as ADM [anti-depressant medication], and that its effects are more enduring. Thus, even if CT and ADM work through the same mechanisms in the same temporal order to reduce depressive symptoms, any enduring effects of CT must be produced by mechanisms that are not mobilized in the same way by ADM. The model that is proposed in this article suggests that CT helps patients learn to recruit prefrontal regulatory brain mechanisms – a skill that these patients could continue to use long after treatment ends. Exploring the neural bases of these effects should enhance our understanding of the nature of depression and allow us to develop more powerful and targeted preventive interventions.</i><p>Therapy works and most of all it lasts. Medication may work, but when you stop taking it, you&#x27;re back to square one.\nThe most important aspect of this is the acknowledgment that therapy works, through mechanisms not activated by medication. Understanding why therapy works can open the doors to understanding the disease and new modes of treatment.<p>[1] <a href=""http://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/ocd-watch.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2748674/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2748674/</a>",1445699359

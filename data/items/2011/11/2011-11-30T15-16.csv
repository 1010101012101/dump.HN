For starters many employers will NOT hire an H1B holder, so that narrows your options right off the bat. The companies that do hire  H1Bs will often only do that for certain positions, so your career plans had better be exactly in line with those positions..",1322668675

Rock and pop music, which cram everything into the midrange, compress well.  But music which strays further into the treble and bass doesn't. Even when a difference shows up, whether it's noticeable is going to depend on who's listening.<p>The most noticeable example I can think of offhand is the David Bowie album Outside - there are a few spots where entire tracks drop out in 256kbps AAC.

For the most part, adults aren't going to be able to sink much time into their hobbies (certainly not enough to become world class) - most of my friends who did sink time into learning to shred on a guitar (and the like) don't really use those skills now. I spend most of my personal time playing sports, but other than the side effect of being rather fit, I don't think they are intrinsically any more fulfilling than spending a similar amount of time becoming just as good at competitive gaming.<p>Re: SC -> SC2 - not really a great analogy, considering how well professional SC players have adapted to SC2. They might complain about it, but there's actually a pretty high correlation between being good at SC and transferring that skill to SC2. (Not to mention that the few SC players that have switched to SC2 so far haven't been top-tier. I can't imagine how well the top-tier SC players would do at SC2 in comparison.)

I guess the GWT crowds beat y'all by miles since 2007.<p>The problem with this kind of web-app is that it's so much harder, so much more difficult, so much effort is required.

In 2011, we still don't have automation test framework that is headless (console based) without requiring investment to infrastructure.

As in, most transactions should basically just consist of a single pointer-swap.<p>What are typical operations during transactions that are more complex than this?  I suppose if several variables are modified in sequence there could be problems---is this typical when STM is used in object-oriented languages?<p>If so, that basically demonstrates the value of using immutable data structures, generally considered beneficial for any form of concurrency.  And so it's no wonder that STM is more popular in functional languages.<p>But when I've used locks in the past in C++ or Java, I've always avoided problems by reducing my synchronization periods to pointer swaps, either for updating a state vector or for passing ownership of an object; so the same lesson, I believe, is applicable to locks.

We use a mix of proprietary and OSS products here and we've found that paid support is somewhat better for proprietary (easier to get, though quality varies extensively), but free support is typically better for OSS products.<p>Still, the main benefits of OSS have little to do with free support, though it is a nice bonus.

C can be unforgiving on the novice, so battling C while trying to learn OpenGL concepts can quickly become a losing battle. Portability is at the cost of complexity, setting up a C/C++ OpenGL cross platform build environment is not a piece of cake, especially on Windows.<p>C does allow low level access to memory, while this is powerful it also adds complexity. Things like loading a text file or image file aren't straightforward. Many libraries are in various states of disrepair. Getting a crash course in static vs dynamic libraries, linker settings, dependency/DLL hell detracts greatly from the learning experience.<p>Suggesting that allowing the programmer to use a buffer object or array in a call to GLBufferData would be somehow more complicated than wrangling with pointers & memory allocation is something I'll have to firmly disagree on.<p>I'd honestly suggest someone starting out with OpenGL to try out WebGL. Loading shaders & textures is a snap(comparatively) & your build environment is your web browser & with that you get instant feedback. Javascript debuggers have also come a long way.

I guess I would be more on the ""let's understand the most of what happens and not change what don't need to"" kind.<p>Concurrent versioning lets you do the ""not change what don't need to"" part really, really, well. Versions of packages that have been proven to work well with one another can continue to do so because if you need a newer version of some library then both the old and the new version can live harmoniously in the same codebase. You don't need to be paranoid about upgrading modules anymore because node and npm are already paranoid on your behalf.",1322666429

DFW was a writer of singular ability, and he was, at various points in his life, dedicated to tennis, philosophy, and mathematics.<p>DFW is a good example, actually. As far as I know from reading his nonfiction, in tennis he never got beyond 'very promising youth' but dropped out at some point when he realized he would never be truly great; in philosophy, he published an interesting thesis which was well-regarded - but that's not a career in philosophy, much less world-class philosophizing, and then he dropped out of that; and I'm not sure what, if anything, original he ever did in mathematics. What he is remembered for is being a writer (with interest in tennis, philosophy, and math), and being a writer is what he spent most of his short life doing.<p>Fact is, we don't expect world-class people to have many real interests or sidelines besides dabbling; look at the recent post on Heddy Lamar.

For instance, 20 mn ago, I did vim /usr/lib64/python2.6/unittest.py and could check this piece of code directly. I did see no special magic that could not be provided by other modules, like Nose or py.test. Moreover, the code was not looking like ""neglected code"", even if it did not look like the most modern kind.<p>> experimenting, and iterating is much harder<p>Well, that's what I like the most with core modules: they don't change overnight, and, while some of them like urllib(2) may be replaced by some because they have a better competitor, most of them are just good old friends, like scipy, that don't need to be put upside down every month because someone found a slightly more elegant way to call two of it's functions.<p>> ""core modules""' advantage evaporates in the face of baked-in concurrent library versioning and sophisticated package management.<p>I have never been considered as a shy sysadmin when I was sysadmin.

He wasn't really ""moving on from Rails""... he was leaving the view layer behind. And then evaluating what else he really doens't need.<p>There's a strong movement among some of the more verteran Rails devs to write abstractions, ensuring that the ap doesn't depend on the framework as much.

There is no secret sauce.  Broadcasters news feeds are already running through packaging scripts for the web, this would be the Facebook component.

Ideally you'd have one 'cleaned' version of the audio playing and switching views just switches video.<p>This may be more legally grey than just piping through audio since you are actually producing a derivative work (even if it is mechanically produced), but the net effect would be awesome. You'd end up with better audio than any one person could record, and the more angles you get the higher quality you can make the audio.<p>Definitely a great idea and very well done for the first cut.

1. Is the data logged on the device? (I guess that should be easy on a rooted device),
2. Is there any data sent even if the 'htc quality agent' is not activated? (route it through a linux box, tcpdump)
3. Is the data really anonymized if the 'htc quality agent' is enabled?",1322665233

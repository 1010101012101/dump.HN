It makes sense, but not when you add up the calories; I was putting in way more than the most optimistic calculators said I was spending.<p>Then I moved closer to work, and had a total of maybe 20 minutes on my bike every day - but this being a cheaper bike I could leave it locked up outside (with a decent lock, natch) so it was my primary form of transport for <i>everything</i> - going to the shops, commuting to work or meeting friends out and about in town. I was still eating whatever I wanted albeit in slightly smaller portions without putting on a pound.<p>Whilst it's interesting and valuable science to discover quite what on earth goes on when we eat things, if your biggest concern is not putting on weight, why not do exercise that makes you sweat for 20 or 30 minutes 5 days a week?

That's why we're starting to devote half of our time to freelancing, just to put food on the table. This in turn affects the execution I mentioned.<p>Of course instead of freelancing we could completely stop executing and go for a round of fundraising ... but surely there's a chicken&egg problem hiding in there somewhere.

Refined grains (and refined sugars made from grains) shock the insulin system by causing a blood sugar spike (which can be especially bad for diabetics), but they don't cause long term effects.  Fructose, on the other hand, which is found in ENORMOUS amounts in both HFCS, table sugar, and ""fruit sweetened"" things (and in small amounts in fresh fruit) causes kidney issues, must largely be metabolized into fat before being burned, puts a load on the liver, increases appetite and more.

The vast majority of my freelance clients are in this market, so its one I know well.<p>The part where I have a difference of a opinion is here:<p>> I've found that there are quite a few companies that can pay me worthwhile contractor fees yet cannot budget to have a UI guy, a backend guy, and a product manager as employees.<p>Specifically, the definition of 'worthwhile contractor fee'.<p>The average ho-hum web developer with a few years of experience, the LAMP stack, JS/HTML/CSS who can tell the difference between an abstract factory and an anonymous function in London can easily pick up a £250-£350 ($380-$540) per day contract. I would fall (just about) into this category. This however is not the type of engagement I believe the OP was talking about, and not what I was referring to when I said 'worthwhile contractor fee'.<p>The sort of fees I was referring (and I believe the OP is referring to also) to are going to be about one order of magnitude higher than the amounts mentioned above. Hypothetically, imagine what sort of fees you'd be paying John Resig or David Crockford to consult on your organizations frontend code, or DHH to consult on Rails, or Steve Souders to consult on frontend performance, or Chris Shiflett to harden your PHP apps security.<p>While the examples I've given their sound like special cases of internet celebrities, there are really real people making a happy living doing this sort of work at very high (i.e. 'worthwhile') rates. I personally know of technical contractors who are paid more than £1k/day (specifically in database performance, and website conversion), and thats just within my immediate circle.<p>On the other side of the fence, at one one of my previous companies (which wasn't that big, 30-40 staff) we had a team of developers with QA, a separation between front/back/sysadmins, but no one with dedicated database performance experience/skills. We had budget for (and would have gladly paid) something like £10k for a database performance specialist with good references to come in for a week or two, show us what we could do to make our db perform better at scale and establish some best practices for doing things right going forward.",1292966311

It aligned the two poles of the bit to these two archetypal dramas. But the poles of the bit can be aligned with other things.  The Internet can and must be redesigned to reflect a more moderate and realistically human-centered philosophy.</i><p>That paragraph attempts to say so much, it says almost nothing at all. What does the author mean by ""equal parts 1960s romanticism and cold war paranoia""? Does he have any evidence that these ideological considerations actually influenced the design of the Internet, or is this fanciful thinking that draws patterns where none exist?<p><i>One problem is that information in oceanic magnitudes can confuse and confound as easily as it can clarify and empower, even when the information is correct. There is vastly more financial data set down in the world's computers than there ever has been before, including publically accessible data, and yet the economy is a mess. How can this be, if information is the solution?</i><p>The emphasis on small visible harms caused by greater information serves to obscure the larger, less visible good that information technology has brought us. The increased flows of information brought about by widespread computer networks have made life much, much easier for both consumers and producers. Goods, both in commodity and finished form can be compared nearly effortlessly. What's easier, going to four different physical stores, or opening four different shopping sites in your browser? Focusing on the edge cases of network overreach obscures the much larger benefits that access to information brings us.<p><i>They are, however, potentially consequential to American diplomacy, which is often, if we are to believe the cables, both trickier and better intentioned then we might have feared. The contents might be extremely consequential, even deadly, to a hapless individual on the ground -- and we'll once again invoke the canonical unfortunate fellow in Afghanistan who translated for a US diplomat and counted on the USA to keep it secret. I don't know if he exists, but it seems to me that there must be analogs to him, at least.</i><p>That's awfully weak language to support an awfully strong conclusion - that Wikileaks is <i>bad</i> for releasing this data. Most people accept some version of ""no harm - no foul"". That is to say, if an action doesn't cause demonstrable harm, then the action isn't bad, even if the benefits are dubious. I'd say that rule, rather than any precautionary principle applies in this case.<p><i>But it did use all of the cables for blackmail. Encrypted copies were sent around the world, creating what is known as a ""dead man switch."" It was claimed that the encrypted cables contained genuinely dangerous information.</i><p>How does the author know? Has he managed to break the 256-bit AES encryption on the insurance file? If not, any speculation as to the files contents is speculation and should be stated as such, rather than know fact.<p>I'm disappointed in the article. I like its conclusion. I do believe that Julian Assange's actions harmed the United States, and were counterproductive towards his stated aims. However, the structure of this article is so rambling and its arguments so weak, I can't support the author's reasoning process.",1292965704

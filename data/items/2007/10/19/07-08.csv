I picked out ""enemies"" and did everything I could to defeat them which ment being bigger then them.   I refused to accept defeat of any kind, and I constantly forced myself to test new things.  I never tried to perfect anything it didn't matter if things didn't work 100% as long as it was good enough I would move onto the next thing.  In 2003 the dating market was growing 80% a year unlike the -10% in 2006 so growth was a LOT easier.  When 2004 rolled around and word of mouth REALLY kicked in and as they say the rest is history.""<p><a href=""http://plentyoffish.wordpress.com/2006/06/14/how-i-started-an-empire/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plentyoffish.wordpress.com/2006/06/14/how-i-started-a...</a>",1192780081

Well, you'll probably never be Yahoo or Google and you don't have their same requirements, so if you get down with SharePoint 2007 Enterprise Solution Architect Server Plus Pro Home Business, go for it.",1192779828

70198,comment,69868,70041,0,0,mdemare,,,"First, of course the principle of least surprise is good, but it doesn't apply here. No experienced Ruby programmer would look at 'a[0]' and think - oh, an index into an array. They know that it could mean many things, depending on the receiver, not the subscript value.<p>Also in Ruby there <i>is no overloading</i>. Overloading means that a different method is chosen depending on the types of the arguments. That means that in C++, it is <i>not</i> true that ""the type of an object and the method name invoked determine unambiguously the method that is called"".<p>In practise there is also little overriding - there seems to be no need. In C++ there is a lot more, and because of multiple inheritance, things can get confusing. (Overriding and overloading are two ways in which OO-languages violate the principle of least surprise).<p>This means that the reasons why using operator overloading is bad in C++ don't (automatically) apply to Ruby.",1192779265

70193,comment,69664,70044,0,0,davidw,,,"> There is a very good reason why you don't see new Debian releases very often.<p>Yes, and as someone involved in the Debian project since 1997, I think I have a good handle on them:<p>- It's free software, so there's not really any pressure to actually do anything.<p>- Unstable ""works"" well enough for a lot of people's desktops, so that takes even more pressure off.<p>- There a huge number of packages to try and stabilize.  Ubuntu has done a good job of trying to pick a good subset and deal with that, rather than try and be everything to everyone.<p>- There aren't really any paid staff to sit around fixing the more onerous bugs, or do any of the unpleasant muckwork that paid people do.<p>That said, I've had both Ubuntu and Debian boxes that have been upgraded again and again over the years, and there just isn't much cruft at all.  I had one machine in the late nineties that had its main disk swapped out 2 or 3 times, was transferred to a new case/MB once, and upgraded the distribution itself 2 or 3 times, and it worked just fine.",1192777385

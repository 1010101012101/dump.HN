First of all, you're posting this on the Harvard blog, so this sounds like a group of undergrads from the Ivy League and top 20 schools. So this little anecdote has almost no relevance to those who have been on unemployment for over a year. The deliberate omission of where these students come from makes it difficult for me to take this article seriously, especially with the explicit assumption that only MIT students are nerds of a serious caliber, and furthermore that basic SQL is something difficult for non-nerds to pick up.<p>Furthermore, the article doesn't recognize that retraining and job-hunting are separate tasks, and not only are they difficult to do at the same time, but it's actually counterproductive.<p>Finally, the assumption that people are sitting around playing XBox with this money is slander. I doubt the author has spent more than 10 minutes in a social setting with anyone on unemployment. Unemployment checks in most cases probably won't even pay rent.",1296143483

No problem, except it costs $50K to attend MIT.  Hmmm.  Well, you could just take one course.

Singer of Atiyah-Singer index result, one of the best results of 20th century math; Singer was an informal Ph.D. advisor for Simons!<p>So there in the audience was his pretty wife, maybe half his age, and running their charitable foundation.<p>Melinda Gates?  Is there any doubt in your mind that she is the one getting Bill to devote his time to charity?  They have three kids; with the family wealth, they face some special challenges; they could use a lot of attention from both parents; all this emphasis on charity is too much time away from attention on their kids.  So, at least Melinda is so interested in ""helping people"" that she is essentially neglecting her own children.  Why?  She wants praise, acceptance, and approval from the public even if she neglects her children and even her husband and has him neglect his business (Microsoft needs him to return to the CEO slot).  She's determined to <i>save the world</i> super big time.  This ain't a small thing.<p>Laura Bush?  Sure:  Devoting her time to charity.  And, as I mentioned, one of her daughters is in Ethiopia doing the same.  Instead, Laura should be devoting her time to her husband, to getting the daughter in Ethiopia a good husband, and being a good grandmother for the children of her married daughter.  So, again, <i>save the world</i> super big time and neglect own husband and children.  This ain't a small thing.<p>That women want to pursue volunteer work, i.e., charity work, that ""helps people"" is a rock solid part of a large fraction of women, especially Christian women of Western European descent in the US, especially if they have the financial means, and too often even if they do not.<p>Here we can use Hollywood:  Part of what they have to do is present believable images.  Well, in the girl's movie <i>Samantha:  An American Girl Holiday</i> the mother devotes her time to charity and is in a woman's club also crucial for her work in charity.  Seeing this, the grandmother asks if she can help.<p>The husband?  He's clueless and uninvolved in charity.  He is, however, very interested in the adoption in the story while his wife mostly is not.  So, she's more interested in saving the world than being a parent (and the adopted daughters very much need some good mothering), and he is more interested in being a parent than she is.  Again, it ain't a small thing.<p>Even the series of <i>Legally Blond</i> of chick-flicks has her give up her law job, shoot her law career in the knees, leave the town of her new boyfriend, and rush off to a staff job in Congress to <i>help society</i> by saving puppies used for testing cosmetics.  She is so focused on helping society that she has her boyfriend, for the second time, bust his law career to join her in DC.  So his role is to follow her from city to city as she runs around <i>helping society</i>, largely ignoring him, and being wildly irresponsible financially.  Seen that, too often.<p>The leadership of the American Red Cross -- women who want to ""help people"".<p>It's as plain as the difference between boys with short hair and girls with long hair.  If you can't see this, then you are obtuse about society and women.<p>Again, this urge to ""help people"" is commonly stronger than paid career, and even marriage, parenting, and financial responsibility.  It ain't small, and you fail to see any of it.<p>For this point about women, there is no ""prejudice"" at all:  Any man who fails to <i>get it</i> on this point is just oblivious and at high risk of making big mistakes about women.<p>You wrote:<p>""I actually think what you could have done is observed the somewhat socially inept computer geek stereotype; and extrapolated the direct opposite as 'how girls are'.""<p>You are attacking the messenger, not the message.  And, the short answer is, you are wildly wrong.  That's not even close to what happened.<p>I wrote:<p>"" ... the topics might be about cars, cattle raising, household electricity, operation of a commercial pizza oven, cardiology, roasting pastrami, trading foreign currencies, computing, etc.""<p>and you responded:<p>""I encourage you to work with teenage boys and try to engage with them on topics like these.  Nowadays it is not at all common to find a kid who has such interests; computer games, girls, sports and food (i.e.  'gossip') are much more common.""<p>Here you are showing that you are getting a D- in basic reading comprehension.  You totally misunderstood the statement.  Totally.<p>Again, and I won't take the time to count the times, I repeated that boys get interested in the technical topics that are ""around them"" and appear to be important and wrote:<p>""Sorry, but boys have strong desires to master any technical topics around them that appear important.""<p>So, then, sure, my:<p>"" ... the topics might be about cars, cattle raising, household electricity, operation of a commercial pizza oven, cardiology, roasting pastrami, trading foreign currencies, computing, etc.""<p>is rock solidly correct.<p>So, your:<p>""I encourage you to work with teenage boys and try to engage with them on topics like these.""<p>What?  You didn't read what I wrote.  You are confused.<p>Again, if you will read, of course, nearly no teenage boys will be interested in<p>""roasting pastrami""<p>because that topic is not ""around them"".  But if their father runs a deli, then that topic will be ""around them"" and will be fully obviously important to the family finances, and, thus, the boy will likely be very interested in it.  E.g., if the boy is working in his father's deli to get money for his first car so he can take out his girlfriend, then he can be very interested in<p>""roasting pastrami"".<p>His sister?  If his mother works in the deli, maybe his sister will be interested in the part of the deli the mother works in.  If the mother doesn't work in the deli, then the sister likely won't care at all about<p>""roasting pastrami"".<p>So, the boy is interested in career competency as illustrated by his father, and his sister isn't.<p>My point is general:  Again, again, again, again, again, the boys will be very interested in WHATEVER technical topics that are around them and appear to be important from their family, community, etc.<p>Got it now?

Android is on all carriers.  iPhone is on fewer carriers in the US, but more worldwide, and Blackberry is everywhere.<p>W/o Verizon and Sprint they'll continue to struggle.  And frankly they should have made sure they were on Verizon before iPhone.  A US CDMA launch would have likely been better than a global GSM launch.<p>And the phone still has many holes in it.  It looks like a great foundation, but they need to fix the holes a LOT faster than they've been doing.<p>Not fixing the holes is frankly inexcusable.  And IMO probably the best indication that MS is culturally broken.  I get having trouble rev'ing Office or Windows -- those have huge existing user bases (deeply entrenched inthe enterprise) so you have to be extremely careful and move with great deliberation.  With phones they have no legacy, no current customers, aren't in the enterprise at all, are playing catch up, and have huge holes.  If this isn't a time when you rev hard and fast, I'm not sure when it is.  And they have a great model in Chrome of a team that can do it with high quality.<p>MS not being agile with WP7 would worry me more than threats to Office and Windows, because it indicates an inability to react.",1296140928

One of those books which was in some passages extremely hard (or even painful) to read is ""Thou shall prosper"" from Daniel Lipman, a (right wing) Rabbi! It changed the way I look at business. Some arguments convinced me, others I still can't accept. But it showed me that axioms which seem counter-intuitive to me can build a very practical world view.<p>Another book which is rather on the extreme side is Eckart Tolle's ""The Power of now!"". Again, I sometimes couldn't stand his opinion. For example whenever he quotes Jesus and explains that most people get it wrong but in fact it would be like this or that.<p>But the book showed me that I was worrying and thinking way too much and that this is at best useless and sometimes even dangerous.<p>Often books don't even tell you something new.

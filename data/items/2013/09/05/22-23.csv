6337667,comment,6335292,6337111,3,0,saidajigumi,,,"> This library turns it into self-docummenting code, which is incredibly valuable.<p>The problem is that for anyone who knows how regexps work, this library provides an obfuscation layer. I personally prefer the free-spacing regexp support[1] found in a number of popular parsers.  It lets you write a complicated regexp in small and/or indented chunks across multiple lines, including comments.  This provides as much or more documentation than this &quot;self-documenting&quot; form and allows the full power of the regexp engine (which big regexps often seem to need). I&#x27;ve occasionally had to work out some pretty gnarly regexps, but when written in two-column code/comments form they end up being pretty understandable and maintainable.<p>[1] Example from the Ruby docs. IIRC, Python and a few other parsers have similar support: <a href=""http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Regexp.html#label-Free-Spacing+Mode+and+Comments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Regexp.html#label-Free-Sp...</a>",1378421925

In a world of rational actors, yes, obviously everyone should read all the fine print all the time, just like everyone should every word of the manual for every product they buy. The problem is, a typical internet power user is signing up for new services on a weekly basis, and most of them have 20 goddamn pages of fine print of which 19.5 are useless, meaningless gibberish. Corporations train their users to not read fine print, because 99% of the time it&#x27;s half an hour wasted to learn nothing of value, and then exploit that training to slide shit past the radar. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable to expect a company that cares about its users&#x27; welfare to put the really notable bits up front in full-size print.<p>Just as an example, did you know that, by signing up for a comment account on any Gawker Media site (Lifehacker, Gizmodo, Gawker.com, Deadspin, io9, Kotaku, Jalopnik, Jezebel), you give them explicit blanket permission to <i>sell</i> any positive comment you make about a commercial product for use in that product&#x27;s advertising?

How can something be both pretentious and buddy-buddy informal?<p>Pretentious: &quot;Attempting to impress by affecting greater importance, talent, culture, etc., than is actually possessed.&quot;<p>Greater important and talent than possessed? Meyer conveys an informal team of three people and an intern. She also admits to just having enough knowledge of Adobe Illustrator to be dangerous. You even admit that it&#x27;s buddy-buddy and informal, which <i>downplays</i> the importance. What if you got the impression that the design session was buddy-buddy because that&#x27;s what it authentically was? Should she have lied and said that it was a rigorous exercise that was formally structured as a meeting of non-equals rather than a collaboration of colleagues?<p>Pompous: &quot;Exaggeratedly or ostentatiously dignified or self-important.&quot;<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m not seeing the &quot;nave pomposity&quot; in the post. Selecting what to convey in a logo is by definition subjective. The same applies for conveying what kind of food or clothing you like. I submit that any sufficiently detailed description of the rationale behind your food and clothing choices could be similarly mocked, unless you disregard taste by eating the cheapest food possible, or disregard color and style by wearing the cheapest clothing possible.",1378421140

In fact, it is not so much that PKE is what is slow; rather it is that theoretical constructions, which are the only thing we have for PKE but which also exist for symmetric ciphers, hash functions, etc. are slow.<p>Also, while PKE is sensitive to implementation issues and parameter choices, you can have much higher assurance that there are no theoretical weaknesses than you can have with something like AES.  With PKE you usually have a proof that the security of the system depends on the hardness of one problem, regardless of the specific attack strategy the adversary uses.  We do not say that ElGamal is secure against chosen plaintext attacks because we ran a battery of tests designed to detect vulnerabilities to particular CPA strategies; we say it is secure because we can prove that <i>any</i> CPA attack on ElGamal can be used to solve the DLOG problem, and so we only really have to worry about the lower bound on solutions to one problem.

We&#x27;re never going to get Congress, POTUS and SCOTUS to be transparent first, especially when any transparency solution will be disparaged as disadvantaging us against other countries.

Its like saying to someone who doesn&#x27;t know much about cars &quot;Hey you should buy an Elantra!&quot; where the immediate followup from those who don&#x27;t know as much say &quot;well who makes that?&quot;.  For a Mustang, Corvette, or something of similar ilk, the make is less important since its already icon.  Apple has succeeded in making the iPhone an icon where others haven&#x27;t.<p>> This is a selectivity bias writ large. It reminds me of conversations shortly after Apple releases a product listening to people declaring how wonderful it is that Apple focuses on experience and not specs...after a release that is a sea of specs.<p>How, exactly?  Apple has maintained a strong enough brand control over its products that people are easily able to identify them.

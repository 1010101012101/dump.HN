2406254,story,,,1,0,baltcode," Library for tree/graph search?",http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5478683/library-for-tree-graph-search,"I notice that a lot of ""hard"" problems I am interested in or come across need some type of tree search like alpha-beta pruning, or beam search, or a similar algorithm. However, programming them seems like repetitively coding the same things and it is also pretty easy to make mistakes. It seems to me there should be a library that implements these algorithms, and all I should be asked to write is<p>1.   a coding for the solution, i.e., how to get a more specific solution from an incomplete solution. This will give the tree/graph structure.\n2.   Given a partial solution, how to get the maximum/minimum cost, and perhaps an estimate of the cost.\n3.   An Initial solution/partial solution.\n4.   Maybe some sort of a verification solution.<p>I am sorry I haven't given any specific code, but I think I have explained the problem. If I can write code for the functions described above, shouldn't I be able to run a number of tree/graph search algorithms easily? Is there any user friendly library/framework that supports this easily? I'd love it to be in Python or C/C++, but would be interested to hear any suggestions.",1301921890

No doubt front running was a pretty significant practice historically, but I haven't run into the practice in quite some time. At the peak of tasting practices more than 9 in 10 domains were given back during the cooling off period. That number has dropped dramatically since the rules were changed.<p>While I'm sure a bit of front running must still go on, it's hard for me to believe it happens to the average joe much if ever. In that light the rules that page lay out sound pretty over the top, and I'm generally a pretty paranoid person. I'd only worry about front running today if I was a known high value target, one who buys or holds a lot of domains. If that was me, I'd just take some mild precautions.

Then, because of work reasons, I ended up getting a MacBook Air instead.<p>Now, I've been dead-set against switching to a Mac for a long time, because I am <i>incredibly</i> invested with Windows, more so than almost anyone I know. I didn't want to have to relearn everything, plus rewrite all the scripts I have on my Windows machine.<p>Still, I'm pretty happy with the switch so far. The laptop is everything you could want - small, fast, amazingly easy to pull out and turn on for quick use. I haven't actually tortured the laptop with too much programming <i>yet</i>, but OSX has a lot of small advantages over Windows. I'm not finding it too hard to switch, much easier than I thought I would find it.<p>I can't help feeling that, unless the hardware makers get their act together, I'll never be going back to a Windows-based laptop. The MacBook is just too good.",1348405199

And by extension, I'm saying anything of the sort.<p>OP keeps using the word government and then people, as if the two are distinct and different.  It's a technique to make you ignore the fact that the government isn't some other being.  It's made up of people.<p>Treating the government as some alien entity is a political tactic used to frighten people.<p>> Wars only destroy so when no one is threatening you in any serious way engaging in them is crazy.<p>That's a rather naive look, and ignores the own premise set forth by the OP I was responding to (in his case, the people should decide).<p>He's under the belief that the people wouldn't have supported war with Iraq (despite overwhelming support in 2003 for the war).<p>So, I'm not sure what you are really trying to say?  On one hand, the OP says we should attack regardless of a direct threat.  On the other hand, you say we should only attack unless we are seriously threatened (and the will of the people be damned).  Maybe you think we should be seriously threatened <i>and</i> require that people support the war?  This would of course require that people be told how the threat is seriously threatening them.<p>And that's how we got into the war with Iraq.",1348404768

UK model with US-English keyboard, i5 processor. Seems to be flawless with ubuntu. All drivers worked out of the box. Wireless, audio, suspend, wake up, volume keys on keyboard, battery warning. I've been able to use 'CompizConfig Settings Manager' to hack unity to be the way I want. I found a way to disable the low trackpad.<p>It's fast, light, beautiful keyboard. I'm really happy with it. I googled for discount vouchers when I ordered and got 10% off.<p>I'd recommend against buying it for Windows use. I tried it for a couple of days just to see what it was like. It comes preloaded with lots of rubbish (including aggressive Norton popups) and no install media. Awful. The base installation took up half of the 128GB hard disk, which seemed crazy. I uninstalled as much junk as I could, and it worked OK for a bit but later my VPN client stopped working.<p>If you can get an ISO image of Windows maybe you could install windows in virtual box.",1348403070

I.e., not things to be mucked around with, but the result of a commercial transaction that ought to be judged on its capacity to perform as advertised and supported if necessary.<p>Getting a closed, commercial product (with a baroque unix base) to bend over backwards to perform basic functions like backup and installation is not a Plan 9 user's of fun.  I would hazard a guess that the greatest reason Rob got burned could have been the naive expectation that programs will perform their designated task simply and correctly?<p>Considering Apple's user-base, on the other hand, idiot proofing the system seems to be a much higher priority.

That demo game was made with Construct 2, a drag-and-drop game engine - they do make an effort for performance, but as shown by this game, it's a difficult task with all the additional bloat of that type of game engine.<p>The controller library itself has good performance on iOS since that's obviously one of the main targets of something like this.<p>This was me taking a game that completely didn't work on touch devices, and making it work - hence the ""Spacebar to start"".

There are quite a few story source sites that are autokilled on submission because experience has shown that those sites consistently produce blogspam, political rants, or other kinds of stories that violate the Hacker News guidelines. It may be that some users have preferences in what they submit that happen to coincide with sites that are on the Hacker News autokill-on-submission list.

I'm not sure why that happened. The last time I had a submission, from a source that I was sure was an acceptable source for HN, autokilled, I asked pg about it by email, and his response was that a text string in the URL tripped a spam detection algorithm.

Given what I know of the people, the service, and my experience hosting three meetups, this story doesn't feel right.<p>Meetup has done a lot to bolster the tech community in NYC.  I have met almost all of my tech friends in NYC via meetups.  Meetup employees even come to some of my meetups.  I know for a fact that they care about creating positive environments where attendees are not bombarded by commercial interests.  They want you to go kayaking with other kayakers, talk about programming with programmers, or find out how to cook fantastic vegan food with other vegans.<p>False positives sometimes occur and it's a shame.  Perhaps meetup could've been more proactive before shutting the group down.  I personally feel confident that meetup looked at the group and made a fair decision that it was indeed violating the terms of service.<p>As I mentioned above, I host three meetups so perhaps I'm biased.

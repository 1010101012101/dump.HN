In this case, this belief is used as part of criteria for allocating time and effort.<p>If the same theoretician was to state that the proof is wrong because it was written by an unknown, this would constitute an argument. Said argument would be fallacious, because ad hominem argument is invalid in this case.<p>Incidentally, your claim that ""PageRank is the biggest ad hominem attack of all time"" is false precisely because of this distinction. PageRank does not constitute an argument, it's simply a sorting criterion. It's a value produced by an algorithm to determine approximate relevance of a page within the context of a search query. The value itself does not constitute an argument. However, if I were to claim that ""page such-and-such presents false information on such-and-such topic because it's PageRank is bad"" that would constitute a fallacious argument.

I did not forget the money being paid to the government.  Instead I was describing a net effect where employers would keep their internal cost the same and drop the salary offering by the amount of the fee.  The net result is then exactly that part of what would have been the H1B's salary goes to the government instead.<p>By contrast if the fee is only owed by the original employer then any subsequent employer can offer the same salary that they would for a local and have the same total cost for the employee.  Market pressures will push them to do that.  This will push the original employer to pay prevailing market rates or better to keep the employee around long enough to recoup their initial investment.",1262125229

It is true they may be no better than name calling, but they can be highly informative and relevant too.  I know he says they can carry some weight, but even there I do not think he gives at least the right kind of ad hominem attack its due.<p>For instance, in a technical field it can often be very difficult to understand much less evaluate a fully reasoned argument.  In this case, to a laymen reader saying (truthfully of course) ""The author of this piece has been shown to commit scientific fraud"" may be more effective than trying to go through the entire argument in detail.  Similarly with say financial advice being able to truthfully say ""The author has been involved in con games in the past"" can be more persuasive (when true!) than trying to analyze his latest claims.  Even pointing out something like ""This man's PHD is in <nonrelevant field>, not <relevant field>."" can add value to a discussion.  Of course it does not invalidate the original argument from the original author, but it does point out the readers that they should read it carefully and not give limited weight to the author's authority.<p>This is especially true since it can be easier in some technical fields to bring up evidence that sounds good superficially but that an expert knows is false than it is justify the truth.  This is because understanding the truth often requires a detailed technical grounding already whereas the pseudoscience does not.",1262124267

I feel engaged and I see your point. Not every post I make has a great deal of value, but I'd say that not every post anybody makes here has a great deal of value, even pg. Do they deserve a downvote? Not if the cost is that the poster will not bother in the future, we may loose valuable commentary because of that. And especially if the entire thread becomes contaminated because a downvote patrol has gone and tainted the entire thing, preventing other people from posting because they too might be downvoted.<p>But this is entirely different than my post a few levels up (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1021131"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1021131</a>), that's now down to -5 at last look, which is topical, in response to somebody else, laments the use of the downvote as a shorthand for ""fag"" isn't snarky, or rude, isn't spam, isn't overly lengthy, conforms to supposed community standards on being short (as several posters in this topic have brought up) etc.<p>By merely showing agreement with the repondant, I took I a -5 hit to my karma and absolutely nothing in response as to why a downvote in this case is <i>not</i> shorthand for ""fag"".<p>And the main problem is that I can't confront my attackers. Their downvotes are about as anonymous as you can get (anonymity can breed abuse). And the community standards also say that I can't question ""why the downvotes?"". It's not questioning the votes, it's asking for a reason. So there is absolutely no resolution to this.<p>From the downvoters perspective, theirs is an perfect crime, they have no repercussions for abusing the system, the victim has no recourse, and no defense, and cannot even ask why, they cannot even metacomment that downvoting appears to be becoming a problem without martyring themselves and getting more downvotes.<p>If by some happenstance that the victim learns the identity of the attacker because they bothered to post a response, they can't downvote the response and at least see some reciprocity (maybe at higher karma levels than mine you can, but I have no option for example to downvote your reponse). Basically they have absolutely no recourse. They can't even flag somebody who has it out for them and downvotes everything they post because they don't know the identity of their attacker. It's a system perfectly setup for abuse by habitual downvoters as we are now seeing.<p>It's at these moments that I'm saying to myself ""you know what, fuck all of you I'm done here"" even though I know it's just a handful of people that run around in a downvote patrol and do that kind of thing.<p>There's lots of ideas here about how to fix the brokeness of the voting system, here's another, people who habitually downvote, say more than 5 times a month, are no longer able to downvote, and must post at least 20 comments and receive +20 points before they can downvote again. Basically it should be a weapon with consequences.<p>My gut reaction to this absurdity is to disengage and forget the entire thing. To stop posting, and stop conversing and stop trying to find and contribute to interesting discussion in what is probably one of the better forums <i>I've</i> come across in a great many years. pg hasn't commented on this aspect of the system yet as I'm suspecting he's still observing and watching.",1262124181

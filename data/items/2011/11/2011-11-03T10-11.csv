3191161,comment,3190738,3190738,22,0,jerfelix,,,"The fact that Michael can't come up with a single black entrepreneur, when asked to come up with one off the cuff, actually speaks more for his LACK of racism.<p>Michael talks to a LOT of entrepreneurs.  He looks at their quality of their companies.  Sounds like he doesn't look at the color of their skin first.<p>I really appreciate the fact that he does NOT categorize them in his brain, like:  ""This is my list of entrepreneurs.  Blacks on the left, whites on the right.""  No, he thinks of them first as entrepreneurs.  When asked to come up with a black entrepreneur, he has to think through the entire list, checking their skin color.<p>I really didn't find his comment snippet to be particularly offensive either.  He was asked to come up with one on the spot, and couldn't.  BFD.  (I wish he would have said ""I don't consider the color of the person's skin when I meet entrepreneurs"", because isn't that the ideal world?  And he basically said the same thing by struggling to come up with a black entrepreneur.)<p>Ask him to come up with an entrepreneur that drives a blue car, or has red hair or has an ear piercing only in his left ear, and you'll probably get the same struggle, where he has to think about it for a while, and can't come up with one.  So what!",1320317947

Square will realize there's a problem and depending on what their contracts look like they'll either charge them heavy fees and/or fine them to fund having to deal with the fraud, or cut them off.<p>Credit cards has this exact same problem. Physical control of the card pretty much gives you free reign to pay for stuff - most shop staff can't even be bothered to look at the signature or ensure the name has any chance of being yours.<p>> How does the system handle the common use-case where you give a third party (wife,friend,kid,..) the money to go and pay the bill.<p>The article states the current app already allows you to press a button to pay, so presumably you just forgo the convenience and make them press the button if their face doesn't match up.<p>And/or add a way of adding additional authorized people whose images will show up.",1320317837
3191155,comment,3190738,3190738,29,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"It's interesting to me today how so many people view ""business"" as some sort of monolithic political entity, just like teacher's unions or the NRA.<p>So if a politician is upset about the economy (and who isn't?) he meets with ""business leaders"", much the same way if he were upset about proposed rifle regulations he might meet with the NRA, or just like if one country doesn't like the way another is acting they meet with the leader of that country. Likewise, if a CNN reporter is upset (or smells a story) about minorities in the startup scene, she ambushes a leader of the startup community with questions about racism.<p>It shows a complete lack of understanding the thing you are talking about. While you might make a case for institutionalized racism when it comes to funding, there's no way in hell an internet user is going to know the race, gender, religion, nationality, or sexual preference of anybody who runs a webapp. Traction on the net is for the most part stereotype-free. Plus from what I hear funding doesn't have the impact on startups that it had say five years ago. The dynamics have changed. You'd have to be an idiot not to fund a startup that had traction because of the race of the founders, and if you're not using team and traction as primary metrics, good luck with your VC business.<p>The entrepreneurial world is not a centralized, monolithic thing that somehow you can talk or meet with any small number of people and understand and/or control. It's a very poor mental model to use and promote.<p>I just find it weird that somehow reporters, or even politicians, expect there to be a person they could go to in order to talk about the pantheon of entrepreneurship. It doesn't work that way <i>by definition.</i> It's not like there's a startup club where they hand out all these freebies and you're not invited. To slant the coverage that way, even unintentionally and subtly, is really whacked. It implies that economic problems are simply dependent on meeting the leaders of various groups and gaining consensus -- that economics is really just politics by another name. I understand why politicians do this -- they have a faulty mental model of everybody being in some sort of political group to be negotiated with -- but reporters need to up their game. This kind of reporting screws over the viewer big time.",1320317779

I am in the position of seeing this whole story from far away from SV from a small Eastern European country. I think to be far away helps me have a perspective on this 'playing the racism/sexism card' story.
I know lots of Eastern-European guys who has been programming since they were 12 yeaers old, are very good at it, are intelligent, etc. but have incomparably worse 'social status' than anybody in the U.S, even black people or women. 
Lots of talent wasted, lots of people earning fractions of money what they could with a little more connections and 'social proofs' behind them. Here in Eastern Europe we are used to that life is hard, you have to be so good that they cannot ignore you. You have to convince people about how good you are through email or skype, you have to try to get a visa, etc... Women and black people who are born in the U.S. are much more privileged compared to most of the world's population. I have worked at local branches of U.S. companies. I had lots of white/black males/females as my bosses. All of them earned much more money than me and not all of them had the knowledge I have on software development. Anybody with even absolutely mediocre knowledge and not very much experience from the U.S was called 'senior associate', but even very experienced eastern europeans were sometimes titled simply 'associate', etc... I've seen lots of brilliant people with Ph.D-s doing the most boring grunt work, because that's what is outsourced here. But that's life. You have to earn 'social proof' with hard work. I don't think black people or women who are citiziens of the U.S are in especially bad situation in this regard.",1320317101

Just as in chess itself the ratings of players are determined by pairwise comparisons (games between players), they pair players up against problems. If they solve the problem, the rating of the problem goes down, the rating of the player goes up. Players are given problems close to their ratings, which keeps everyone happy. I believe they use Glicko to track uncertainty in the rating.<p>Chapter 22 of David Barber's ""Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning"" (he makes it available online) does a nice (perhaps brief) job of explaining the progression through the Rasch model, the Bradley-Terry-Luce model and Elo.<p>As an aside, the way they chesstempo generate the exercises is also cute. The tactical chess problems are positions taken from high level (human) games fed into a chess engine which identifies blunderous moves where there is a single distinctly best way to respond. The challenge is to find that best move. Because they are taken from real games, they have the appearance and feel of real positions, which is important; many people believe pattern recognition is an important part of chess mastery.

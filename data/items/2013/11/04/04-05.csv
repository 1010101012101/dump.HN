To me, this seems really sad. It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re saying &quot;I&#x27;m so worthless, I can&#x27;t even compete with a robot.&quot;<p>Maybe that&#x27;s true for some people. If so, then the problem isn&#x27;t robots, the problem is that there are people who are less useful than robots. For a human to survive in the era of intelligent machines, he/she needs to have unique skills that are not possessed by robots. If they don&#x27;t have those skills, they need to find them.<p>For those in the tech industry, those skills are already there. It will be decades, or longer, until we can automate software/hardware engineers. Entrepreneurship is another unique skill that will be even harder to automate. I believe that once machines are capable of conceiving, starting, and operating businesses, they will no longer be called machines.<p>What we must never forget is that humans aren&#x27;t intrinsically special. We just happen to be the most capable organisms on the planet right now. The current rate of technological progression suggests that this will eventually change. When it does, we&#x27;ll need to adapt or we&#x27;ll go extinct.<p>If we cannot adapt to this reality, we will simply end up serving as the spawning ground for a new species (biological or otherwise) that will make humans obsolete. If we survive, it will be as little but a historical curiosity.<p>To adapt, we cannot look at robotics and automation as an enemy.

Good people will work with a good process that looks a lot like agile, but if you cram that same process down the throats of a random group of developers then you are going to get random results.<p>The details of the methodology don&#x27;t matter. If you look at what <a href=""http://semat.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://semat.org/</a> is proposing for the standard engineering methodology for developing software you will find that it <i>IS</i> agile, but it is not specified down to the nth detail and more importantly, it is extensible and adjustable so that any significantly sized project can build their own compliant methodology and process within the SEMAT framework. That part is so often missing, where the developers themselves discuss how to go about building the software, and management listens to them and defers to the developers because they are software engineering professionals.",1383537679

It&#x27;s pretty easy to build something productive in that kind of environment, but then thinking that your productivity in an ivory tower will be matched in the real world is just ignorant.<p>To demonstrate this property, consider iTunes, probably one of the most key pieces of software today, responsible for distribution of many types of media across the globe while paying authors instantly, at a small cost of freedom for both parties.<p>Now write that code on pamphlets and drop it from a plane over Africa.  Pay close attention to what happens.  If you look close enough you&#x27;ll notice not a god damn thing happens that is not related to the physical medium being re-appropriated for productive uses.  They won&#x27;t reverse engineer the code, they won&#x27;t abstract away the key business principles and build a new prosperous Africa, they won&#x27;t learn how to program either.<p>You see, Africa has no need for a digital distribution system with DRM.  They don&#x27;t even have a network capable of carrying it&#x27;s data to 99% of the population.  Even if you set one up and gave away iCrap to every African, you&#x27;d never recoup the astronomical costs selling copies of bits.<p>The thing SV needs to realize is they are not the first coders and they are already surrounded by code, at the level of societies, religions and governments.  These coders are much better because they&#x27;ve been dealing with inconsistent platforms for hundreds of years without the benefit of virtualization layers or government-enforced standard protocols.<p>Sure, you can generate the same kind of code that runs governments and religions from a computer, but you&#x27;re forgetting the fact that that computer exists inside the system of government.<p>As soon as you remove the government, your hardware gets stolen by people with better hardware, your software gets stolen by people with better software, and your communications data gets mined by deep packet inspection, extracting value just like an invisible tax or inflation.  That last one was a joke, you need government for that.",1383537674

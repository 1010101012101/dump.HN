Also, there's a good chance (I suppose) that you'll get to work on core products at RogueWave.  They make money on their C++ software; that's probably what you'll get to work on.  That's very, very good.<p>Case in point about experts - I work for a huge defense contractor.  I suspect that in terms of C++ expertise, I am in the top 5 or so out of at least 2000 engineers at my site.  It's not that I'm so awesome, but just that C++ is just not what we do here.  There are plenty of experts here on other topics, but there aren't many people I can really learn from here on the topics I care most about (not limited to C++, obviously).  There are a few, and I latch onto them as fast as possible.<p>Ask yourself: are you going to be exposed to the rare experts in a field that interests you at Cisco?  Possibly, but ""web-based deployment Q/A system thing"" sounds like internal IT-crud to me - and that's not Cisco's business.  Also, ask yourself, ""Self, will I be working on essential business products at Cisco""?  Remember that Cisco is based in San Jose.<p>In other words, the two things to consider:<p>1. will you have unique access to experts in fields/topcis that you care about?<p>2. will you be working on the thing that the business is <i>about</i>? (i.e., if you work at a router company, you better be working on routers.  If you work at a software company, you better be working on their prime software.  if you work at Ford, you better be working on designing vehicles...you get the idea).<p>In response to a couple other comments:<p>Don't worry too terribly much if the problems seem interesting.  Pay attention, of course - have a basic filter - but you're a student looking for an <i>internship</i>.  Students looking for internships have no earthly idea what is truly interesting and what is not - learning what's interesting and what's not is part of what internship experience is about (e.g., my experience as a Microsoft intern in testing - SDET - clued me in to the fact that I don't want to be a ""tester"").<p>Good luck.",1206712694
148521,comment,148351,148351,0,0,ssharp,,,"I think it's obvious that the music industry is headed towards an ""all you can eat"" model to generate the bulk of revenue related to its recorded properties.   Either this (doubtful) or a premium on your MP3 player (likely), or something else.  What will be interesting is how this changes the way music gets marketed.<p>I actually don't see anything changing.  Labels will simply push all their artists into 360 deals where the labels get money for not only their record sales but also  everything else, touring, merchandise, etc.  The incentive is still going to be there to promote acts that classically ""sell"" even if ""sell"" no longer includes record sales.",1206712647

Over time, people would be come more and more ""cybernetic"" as their natural parts failed and technology came up with ""improved"" replacements.",1206712198

148512,comment,147710,147791,0,0,vixen99,,,"Problem is we're way off being able to prescribe these things knowing with certainty that they'll work to our advantage. I'm saying that as a one-time biochemist and long-time pill pusher myself. Take selenium and prostate cancer. The picture is cloudy. A researcher in the field whose earlier work offered support for Se supplementation now wonders if it's such a good idea. Whatever Kurtzweil's taking, I hope it works for him.",1206711684
148511,comment,148504,148504,0,0,iamwil,,,"I can see how having something industrial packaged for home or desktop use can change things.  It happened with computing, desktop publishing, photography, and it's on it way with 3D printing.  They're all things that allowed people to create things with a lower cost.<p>However, I'm currently having a hard time seeing how a desktop microscope will change things, because it's an observation tool, rather than a creation tool.  Anyone else got a different perspective?<p>It'd be fun and interesting to explore, that's for sure.  It certainly wouldn't be a creation tool, but maybe educational and inspirational to see the world of the very small, just as it's inspirational to see the world of the very big with microsoft's telescope.",1206711558

148508,story,,,8,18,scottw,"Glass Bead Network launches (finally)",,"http://glassbead.net/<p>This is a social game played (for free) in a flash client. It's been 5+ years of nights-and-weekends bootstrapping (we did receive a few thousand dollars from one of our dads a couple of years ago, but that's all the funding we've got).<p>We (three founders) are mid-thirty-somethings with families. We feel pretty confident in the game itself--people who play it enjoy it and come back to play again.<p>What we're trying to figure out now is three-fold: a) how to get the ""critical mass"" of users we need so that something is always going on so when new users come to visit, there's someone for them to play, or at least a few games they can watch (and what is that number?). We've pretty much milked our family and friend connections at this point.<p>b) we'd love to have money so we could do it full time, market it, etc. but because we're so far along already (i.e., it's working) we're not sure whom to turn to (VCs, for example, aren't really interested because we don't need very much money). Do we just keep bootstrapping, or are there groups that fund people like us?<p>c) any feedback (we're looking for feedback mostly from anyone who's actually played it, but we'll consider anything really)?<p>We hope to be able to take subscriptions soon (""premium service"" which would give you some minor advantages in the game, or at least a few more options, cash tournaments, blog, etc.) and we're considering having ""sponsored"" beads (beads are our playing pieces, which represent everything in the known universe--from Oreo cookies to apples to Darth Vader) as the primary revenue source someday.<p>We're holding a tournament tomorrow (Saturday, March 29) at 6p MDT if anyone wants to just come and watch (or play, of course).",1206711231

Where property rights are hard to define, resources are over-extracted because there is no owner with the incentive to conserve.<p>I challenge you to name one resource with normal property rights that fits the ""diagonal line/cliff"" scenario.

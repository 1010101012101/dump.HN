In principle, mathematical proofs are supposed to be every bit as completely described as computer programs, but perhaps not as explicitly expressed. Edsger Dijkstra used to refer to mathematical proofs as a model for computer programming.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_derivation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_derivation</a>",1231606483

In fact, when it was first announced, many people criticized Apple for not having a native SDK.  People felt that it was too limiting and you couldn't really tap into the power of the phone.  We've seen some great applications since the SDK has come out that shows that these folks were justified in their initial critiques.<p>As it is now, you can still program apps for the App Store using web technologies through the WebView object.",1231606182

Maths just doesn't work today the way it did in Newton's time, and even back then people weren't satisfied with Newton's proofs, but they lacked an alternative so they had to use them anyway.

In one of the quotes he uses the idea of 'marginal utility' to further an argument. The quote is taken from a book about (and by a broad proponent of) Marxism. Much of Marxism is built on the labour theory of value, which proponents of marginalism believe to be discredited by the marginal theory of value, which is tightly derived from the idea of marginal utility.<p>I haven't read any of Elster's work. All the same, I'm confident there's some rigorous turd-polishing going on between the pages of that volume.

There seems to be a lot written by this under the topic of 'Analytical Marxism', including that ""Elster and Przeworski were notable departures from the group in the early 1990s."". I've heard friends recount stories from professors about the period that say that buying into Marxism was in some circles had a similar dynamic to baptism in born-again Christian circles.

He can't do skype/flickr/blogspot etc without help. It's hard for us tech people to see this.<p>And once you put those neighborhood conversations the author mentioned online, you'll have to deal with privacy (ie control), which is an even bigger problem.<p>The next 10 years are gonna be fun.",1275738900

I use Chrome for almost all my browsing, but if I need Flash or something else on a specific site, I can open it in IE or Firefox.<p>Maybe someday Chrome will have a plugin ""whitelist"" for sites so I can only allow Flash on the sites I want to.",1275738280

1406759,comment,1406701,1406707,0,0,stefano,,,"I've used Parrot as a target for a language implementation. It supports a lot of stuff out of the box (even multimethods!) and it's quite easy to get started. It also provides tools to help you build a compiler, like a parser generator integrated with the rest of the system. The problem is that right now it is quite slow, slower than Perl or Python, and a bit buggy. It would be an ideal target platform for dynamic languages otherwise. I wouldn't use it for something needed in production at the moment.",1275736990

Take the same book home, or hell, take ten books home on that subject and you will still miss many salient points that only prolonged formal study of the subject will bring.<p>That's the trick with the humanities - they are not hard sciences, there is no canonical body of knowledge to be passed on; This isn't a straight download. Many things are a matter of perspective, of experience, and of particular schools of thoughts - all of the above poorly communicated via mere books.<p>That's the difference between a history book vs. a good history professor. Even without the (invaluable) ability to interact directly, it's the difference between a dry recounting of facts vs. more profound linkages into other areas of the field, or entirely other fields of study altogether. Sure, by reading books you will make some of these connections yourself, but it's hardly as good as what you'd get in classes.<p>That being said, there are certainly bad profs who <i>do</i> just do the dry recounting of facts, in which case you <i>are</i> basically better off reading the textbook at home. The presence of these should in no way discount the enormous positive influence of college educations done right.",1275736326

If this Flash update is indeed not-ready-for-prime-time (heck, they may even know of specific issues) then it becomes irresponsible to push it out to all users.

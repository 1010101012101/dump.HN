Spelling and grammar is not what I am best at, and English is not my first language so I take the help I can get. I have used OpenOffice/LibreOffice and am using Google Docs, but none of them comes close to Word in helping with my spelling and grammar. I did type this comment in Word to get rid of the most obvious errors, and I do even type my master thesis in Word and copy the text to my latex editor for formatting.

6538905,comment,6538408,6538796,8,0,DanBC,,,"Heroin is presently illegal.  Possession of heroin with intent to supply carries a prison sentence.  Possession of heroin for personal use is a criminal offence.<p>Drug addicts take drugs.  They&#x27;re not deterred by the legal status of the drug.  Heroin being illegal doesn&#x27;t stop addicts taking heroin.<p>By making a drug hard to get illegally all you do is make a drug addict commit more crime to get it, or take more risks.<p>Heroin users inject contaminated drugs, using re-used (sometimes shared) needles, in dirty surroundings.  This carries considerable risk of infection from diseases like hepatitis and HIV.  It also carries significant risk of abscess or even amputation.<p>Heroin users need money to buy heroin.  This money can come from sex working.  Sex work is an unregulated semi-legal activity.  There are risks of rape and assault.  There are risks of sexually transmitted infections.  People dislike the advertising associated with sex work.  Because sex work is unregulated there are other vulnerable groups dragged into it - trafficked women, homeless people, and children.<p>Or the money comes from other crime - mugging, burglary, theft.  And people spending all their cash on heroin will steal food.<p>Heroin&#x27;s illegality means that its supply is controlled by criminal gangs.  There is violence associated with these gangs.<p>Even the &quot;nice&quot; drugs - cannabis - have considerable problems from their illegal status.  We can&#x27;t do proper science because of the problems of getting and giving cannabis.  Cannabis is sometimes grown by slaves trapped in grow-farms in houses.  There are links between cannabis grow farms and housing benefit fraud in the UK.<p>Heroin being illegal makes it harder for people to look for or get help.  We can&#x27;t taper addicts down using heroin, so we use methadone.  It&#x27;s tricky to talk about how addictive a substance is, but some people feel that methadone is more addictive than heroin.<p>When heroin is too tightly controlled you just switch addicts to even worse drugs.  See, for example, the Russian drug Krokodil.  This is desomorphine, cooked from codeine-containing meds, but in dirty unclean situations.  The high from desomorphine is intense but short-lived, so people cook and cook frequently.  They&#x27;re careless with the procedure. This means that they&#x27;re using filthy needles to inject god-only knows what.  An image search for &quot;krokodil&quot; returns many grisly horrific images.  Addicts using krokodil live for about 3 years.",1381589576

6538902,comment,6537471,6537471,3,0,skue,,,"I&#x27;m disappointed to see that MS Word has become the default for publishers. Back in 1999 I authored a web programming book for O&#x27;Reilly. At the time, their technical folks would begrudgingly accept Word files, but they strongly preferred FrameMaker.[1] Some of that probably had to do with the propensity for large Word files to become corrupted, but it&#x27;s also because FrameMaker helped authors generate documents with much cleaner styling than Word. It&#x27;s a shame that Adobe let FrameMaker languish.<p>FrameMaker allowed you to do ad hoc formatting, but it was designed for a stylesheet approach. The difference is analogous to creating a web page and declaring styles inline (how most folks use Word) vs. using a stylesheet (how most folks used FrameMaker). It is possible to pop open a style inspector in Word and use that instead, but it feels like an afterthought.<p>Pages also has a style inspector, which is my favorite feature (despite the old-school NeXT-style drawer). For a reason that I can&#x27;t easily articulate, using styles in Pages feels cleaner than Word and more like using FrameMaker. So if I have to create a large Word document I will typically do so in Pages, then export to Word.<p>[1] I believe O&#x27;Reilly also accepted alternative open source formats such as DocBook and LaTeX. And though these might be great formats, I could never find an editor that I could stand using for more than a few minutes -- let alone the months needed to write a book.",1381589548

There is copious literature on this.<p>Laudanum was used safely for the better part of the late 19th century. The word &quot;heroin&quot; is actually a trademark of Bayer (yes, the same folks who also gave us &quot;aspirin&quot;)[0]. It was sold successfully and without any large-scale devastating effects for several years; the reason it was eventually outlawed had nothing to do with any negative repercussions of the drug on a large scale.<p>As for methamphetamine, according to the MTF and NSDUH studies, the majority of people who have used methamphetamine in the last 30 days <i>do not meet DSM criteria for substance dependence</i>[1]. That&#x27;s not looking at everyone who&#x27;s ever used methamphetamine; that&#x27;s looking at people who have used it within the last month. Clearly it <i>can</i> be used &quot;without affecting all of society&quot;[2].<p>This is, of course, ignoring the fact that methamphetamine is Schedule II and can be obtained legally (albeit in rare cases) with a prescription (under the brand name Desoxyn).<p>[0] Both trademarks are now generic; Bayer eventually lost these trademark protections. This is why your local drugstore is allowed to sell acetylsalicylic acid under the name &quot;aspirin&quot; (with a lowercase &quot;a&quot;).<p>[1] Most also wouldn&#x27;t meet the DSM criteria for substance abuse either, except for a technicality in the criteria that references the legal status of the drug, which is naturally self-fulfilling.<p>[2] Unless you are looking at the economic impacts (ie, Nicaragua 30 years ago, North Korea and Afghanistan today, in which case you have a point, but that only serves to emphasize the need to short-circuit these black markets with legal ones).",1381589153

Usually the spec is lacking and the customer (internal or external) doesn&#x27;t really know what he wants. After that, feature requests and bug fix hacks will deteriorate the condition of the code base to the point where things break if you look at it. Rewriting will be difficult because instead of formalising the requirements in a specification, with all the hacks and features added the existing code base is the spec. So you end up with something very fragile and not so agile.

However, with the current implementation this will return a JSON document that is identical to the input, modulo whitespace. This makes it easy to write tools that can, for example, increment the version number in a nodejs package.json file programatically. Doing this in a world where comments exist becomes extremely awkward or at the very least annoying, because either you have to write your own JSON parser that preserves comments, or you have to simply discard the comments when you&#x27;re writing the file.<p>If you go with the first option, you&#x27;ll inevitably run into a scenario where you have a document like this contrived example:<p><pre><code>    {\n      // this is the first ever version!\n      &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAnd your tool goes off and increments the version number, so you end up with:<p><pre><code>    {\n      // this is the first ever version!\n      &quot;version&quot;: &quot;2.0.0&quot;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nand now your comment is a lie.<p>If you go with the second option, you destroy all comments whenever you write data back to the file, so they can be deemed temporary at best.<p>What benefit do you actually get from having comments in either scenario?",1381588824

That would be Diablo III, GTA V, Cookie Clicker (does that count?) and Super Hexagon.<p>And frankly, if Rockstar wiped Online servers after I (and many, many, many) more people put ~20 hours into it, as much as I love that game, I would quit and never look back. I just don&#x27;t have patience to grind all day long anymore.<p>You also have to remember that you can purchase in-game-currency with micro transactions - paying fifteen bucks for GTA$ and then seeing it vanish next day because ladder season ended would be... frustrating, to say the least.<p>/I&#x27;m sorry if my rant is a little bit incoherent, but video-games and hardcore gamers demanding developers to cater to them are my pet-peeves./<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.theesa.com/facts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theesa.com/facts/</a>",1381587669

6538787,comment,6529249,6529249,1,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Dan, thank you for making this. You did a good job of summarizing and relating the three concepts.<p>I think there were two things that got left out, but the 20 minute time was perfect anyway. First, an emphasis on just how minor a distraction can be to interrupt flow or annoy (some) introverts -- a leaf blower, a ringing phone, staring off into space and having someone else look at you and then try to figure out what you&#x27;re looking at -- and second, that introverts are more likely to have some understanding of introversion v. extroversion and their needs, while many extroverts are oblivious to the differences.<p>I&#x27;ve been living in a sort of introvert&#x27;s hell for a few years now, it&#x27;s really starting to get to me. I live and work in the same house, along with my girlfriend and another person. I don&#x27;t have a space that&#x27;s distinctly mine, and the other person and I run a business together.<p>I supervise his work on and off throughout the day, juggle email and the occasional phone call and a variety of other distractions, but I also need to be doing work that requires focus -- coding on big projects, or, to use yesterday&#x27;s example, redesigning our business cards. While trying to do that, a visitor dropped by and discussed Airsoft at length two feet from my right shoulder, another person came and went, we were expecting another visitor (who didn&#x27;t show until hours later), and my girlfriend needed right at that moment to take pictures of the cat and send them to her friend.<p>I gave up, ran a few errands, went to bed at 7, got up at midnight, just after everyone else had gone to bed, and got the card design knocked out and a few other things taken care of.<p>My sleep schedule is all over the place. Half the time I&#x27;m getting up late and staying up late -- and tolerating the occasional comment about sleeping in so late -- and the other half I&#x27;m going to bed early and getting up early and struggling to get through the day. If I try to code when I&#x27;m up late, I&#x27;m often already exhausted, and focusing for very long is extremely difficult.<p>It&#x27;s rough on my personal life, too; my girlfriend is frustrated that I don&#x27;t want to go out and do things with her and her friends very often, but the thing is, without any downtime of my own, I&#x27;m already in a constant state of social exhaustion. The very last thing I want to do after juggling distractions all day is go out and be social. For her, it would be like having to be cooped up inside, by herself, for a few days, with no outside contact, and then having me come in and suggest a nice quiet evening at home.<p>So, lately this has turned into this overwhelming desire to just leave and go somewhere -- anywhere -- alone, for a week or more, just so I can get some work done.<p>All of which is to say that, left untreated, introversion can lead to insanity. :-)",1381587253

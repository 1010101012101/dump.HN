In fact, I wish that more manufacturers would do it...<p>I <i>hate</i> setting things on my desk, then having them slide all over the place...one of my favorite pieces of kit is my old 1987 model M keyboard.  Not entirely because of the bucky-spring keys, the wonderful noise it makes, or the stark contrast between it, my monitors, my wacom tablet, and whatever new-aged gizmos happen to be floating around on my desk, but because of its heft.<p>My frineds and I have got a scale for judging the utility of a piece of hardware.  ""could you kill somebody with it?  I mean...in the event of zombie apocalypse, could this device be used to take down a zombie?""<p>The answer with the model M is likely a solid ""no"". (it's heavy, and sturdy, but zombies are freaking TOUGH!), but it's close.<p>The extra weight, even though artificial, gives us that feeling of ""this is a sturdy piece of equipment"".  This is a good thing.  I liken it to eating a nice steak.  Your brain is going ""good job!  Eat a lot of this!"" because it is assuming that protein (and fat, and all the other good things in a steak) is/are scarce, and that you should ingest as much as possible.  Well, this is silly...steaks are not scarce!<p>It's the same thing, it's false, it's stupid, it's trickery, but I still like it.",1250567952

769709,comment,769217,769262,0,0,Legion,,,"Facebook and Twitter are completely different. Don't see how a redesign of one would matter one iota for the other.<p>Facebook is about one-to-one relationships. Yes, there are ""groups"" and ""become a fan of X"", but the essence of Facebook, as in other traditional social networking sites, are bi-directional relationships. When I ""friend"" you and you accept, we are ""friends"" in both directions. There are no one-way ""friends"".<p>Twitter is broadcasting, one-to-many relationships. ""Following"" someone is a one-direction relationship. You can tell the people from older sites who don't grok this, insisting that all follows need be ""followed back"". But that fails to understand the power and appeal of Twitter. You can follow Oprah's Twitter feed, but you can't be Oprah's Facebook friend.

769678,comment,768057,769215,0,0,pcarmichael,,,"Without going into too much detail for obvious reasons, we are doing as you mention - converting dataflow into blocks of imperative code and scheduling them on threads.  Although the scheduling we do both at the thread level and also at the block level is non-trivial and reasonably optimized.  I'm sure most of what I'll mention below you've already discovered if you're implementing a dataflow language, but just in case:<p>When implementing/generating code for a dataflow language it really depends on the level of granularity you want for your parallelism.  On one extreme, you have super-fine-grained parallelism and can schedule each operation independently.  On the other extreme, you have little or no parallelism and pre-schedule all of your operations in one big chunk.  In the middle somewhere is typically a sweet spot where you have chunks of operations pre-scheduled, and then dynamically schedule those chunks.<p>A key to optimal dataflow code generation (while retaining parallelism) is figuring out where to draw that line regarding parallelism granularity.  Too granular and you spend all your time scheduling.  Too coarse and you lose all of your parallelism.  The ideal point somewhere in the middle likely depends on the operations themselves (i.e. the composition of your language).  In some cases it is a decision you have to make by trial and error.  In other cases you can make more informed decisions based on the nature of the operations and the context of their use within the program.<p>Communication is really important as well.  CPU caches encourage you to minimize data copies and operate on the data in place when possible (to minimize cache line fetches).  Thus if your communication is based on a scheme where you need separate copies for each operation then your performance will really suffer.  Message passing can work, so long as you are passing things by pointer and aren't having to make copies.",1250565368

They sound like the act in the same fashion and the amount of lobeilia which will be contained in the device likely won't cause any ill affects.<p>From wiki: Native Americans used lobelia to treat respiratory and muscle disorders, and as a purgative. Today it is used to treat asthma and food poisoning, and is often used as part of smoking cessation programs. It is a physical relaxant, and can serve as a nerve depressant, easing tension and panic. The species used most commonly in modern herbalism is Lobelia inflata (Indian Tobacco).<p>The company who are bringing out the product are highly regarded for their dedication to health and safety. They are the only company who have had all their liquid rigorously tested for impurities by an independent clinic in New Zealand. They have also courted the health authorities in every country they have sold their product in and I imagine their new liquid will undergo the same scrutiny.<p>To be honest, after watching the orchestrated smear campaigns conducted against e-cigs in the past year, it wouldn't surprise me if there was a concerted effort to do the same to lobelia.",1250565245

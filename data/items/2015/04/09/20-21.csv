Learning to make music requires lots of boring practice. Lot of people fail after a few month of guitar lessons as a kid.<p>But then there are those manic musicians. A real musician must play everyday, regardless if he has audience, if he gets payed, if it sounds good to anybody but him. A real musician is manic and becomes depressive, if unable to make music. Some of them become great musicians.<p>Its the same with coding. Most people are to shy to try even. Lots of people fail to get traction.

9350976,comment,9342994,9349465,0,0,mikeash,,,"If you&#x27;re a CEO of a large company worried about the impact that poaching will have on your company and on the industry as a whole, you don&#x27;t have to sit around and wait for the churn to <i>eventually</i> stop when the market price stabilized. You can go out and make it happen by paying your people better.<p>We agree that there is <i>some</i> salary level where that constant churn of poaching doesn&#x27;t happen, right? As you said, people generally like to stay where they are. That means that poaching will only work if you can offer something substantially better. When employees are paid well enough that it&#x27;s not worth paying them substantially better just to convince them to leave their current job, the poaching churn will stop.<p>If Jobs wanted to stop the poaching churn without being evil and without breaking the law, it would have been <i>easy:</i> go out and figure out what that salary level is, and start paying it. Or heck, he wouldn&#x27;t even have to go that far. If we assume that the &quot;no poaching&quot; level is vastly higher than current salaries, all he&#x27;d have to do is pay, say, 50% higher than the other companies around, then keep an eye on things and continue bumping up compensation if and when other companies started to follow along.<p>I don&#x27;t see how that scenario has any negative outcomes for anyone besides shareholders and executives who counted on being able to pay $1 to an employee in return for $10 of value forever. There would be no feelings of resentment and betrayal, no combative emotional stances, because none of the churn you describe would happen.<p>Faced with poaching, Jobs had three alternatives. He could ignore it, he could collude with other companies to stop it, or he could pay his people well enough to make the problem go away. The only reason to choose collusion over better pay is to save money by giving less of it to your workers.",1428613021

9350951,comment,9348119,9350052,0,0,moron4hire,,,"I not sure I see any point in separating them. Wagner&#x27;s operas can&#x27;t be separated from the notion of German exceptionalism that laid the groundwork for Nazi ideology. Ender&#x27;s Game does not exist other than as an expression of Card&#x27;s worldview. And he had expressed, through it (at least at the time that he wrote it. I am at least willing to grant the rare occurrence of change in people), that ignorance of the consequences excuses such violence, even violence that was executed under incorrect assumptions.<p>In the real world, Ender not knowing that the kids are being killed <i>would not excuse his behavior</i>. It merely changes 2nd degree murder into manslaughter. With the number of times he repeats this behavior, we&#x27;d maybe even try him as an adult, discarding even the basic notion within our culture that children are generally not yet to be held responsible for all of their actions. When we try children as children, we are not saying the crime was not their fault, we are saying they are not going to be punished for the crime in the same way as an adult. We still punish them.<p>But according to Card, nothing is ever Ender&#x27;s fault. Ender doesn&#x27;t kill them because he is so good. Ender is so good <i>so that he can kill them</i>. The causality in fiction is reversed from reality because there is a distinct narrative to portray, but reality doesn&#x27;t have a narrative, it emerges. He wrote Ender to have misapplied violence on several occasions, so that he can then be excused for it. The aliens aren&#x27;t destroyed because they invaded, the aliens invade so that they can be destroyed. They are aliens so that they immediately have the inhuman status that all genocidal maniacs need to assert before trying to cleans the universe of them.<p>To me, not only the revelation of Card&#x27;s homophobia, but the vociferous manner in which he defended it, is just a corroboration of what Ender&#x27;s Game tells us about who he is: an extremely rabid right-wing ideologue. We see in Card the beginnings of the Neoconservative movement with all of its contradictions nearly fully formed: the claimed reverence for both God and war, the clashing support for small government and large military.<p>And for the life of me, I just can&#x27;t read it as 8 to 10 year old children. I have several nephews spread from 2 through 10 years old and there is an extremely distinct difference in basic maturity level between them all. Ender portrays qualities more like a late teenager and he yet is on the young end of the book&#x27;s spectrum. I just don&#x27;t see 10-year-olds having the capacity to <i>hate</i> someone else &quot;because they are the best&quot;. Mostly because the concept itself is alien to me. I know of it only through its portrayal in the media.<p>It&#x27;s one of the more dangerous ideas we teach kids. It tells them, &quot;if you could just change, it will get better.&quot; And either the kid <i>can</i> change and tries, which is awful, or the kid <i>can&#x27;t</i> and is stuck thinking life will always be like this, which is also awful. Real bullies are just jockeying for acceptance within their peer group and it has little to nothing to do with the victim. Bullying <i>only</i> ends when it&#x27;s made to no longer be entertaining for the bully, a shockingly easy thing to achieve, if you just know that that is what needs to happen.<p>But also because that sort of hate takes fear. That&#x27;s why we use the &quot;phobia&quot; ending on homophobia. Children don&#x27;t know that kind of fear yet. You have to start to become aware of your own limitations, and the accompanying fear that someone else&#x27;s success could have a detrimental impact on your own. Kids that age are only a few years into realizing the ball doesn&#x27;t just dematerialize when you hide it behind your back, say nothing that there are limits on what they will be able to achieve.<p>These fights are fantasies in Card&#x27;s head, projections of what he thinks makes for righteous cleansing of that which he sees as besetting him from all sides. It&#x27;s the ol&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Merica is going to hell in a handbasket&quot;. He feels like everyone is out to get him, his way of life, and he is surrounded, so escape isn&#x27;t an option. And if someone dies in the process, it&#x27;s not his fault, he was &quot;just&quot; defending himself. Because in his head, he&#x27;s fighting for survival, and might makes right.<p>Classic fundamentalism.",1428612788

I decided I needed to do more (screen) writing last year, I was annoyed that I had not written much in the previous few years and was feeling age creeping up on me. But although I&#x27;ve written several short and feature-length screenplays, it had always been an exhausting all-or-nothing process rather than a steady sustainable output.<p>So I thought to myself that if I only wrote one page a day, I would have 365 pages at the end of a year, which was a lot of material even if it did not assure any single project being complete. One page a day is not a scary target, even if one is feeling creatively empty it&#x27;s still possible to crank out a page of something bad. So if I really had no ideas I&#x27;d pick some random idea like &#x27;car chase&#x27; and force myself to just start writing a bout a car chase without worrying about why it was taking place - maybe I would be able to recycle it later for some project that actually required a car chase, or if not at least I would have some experience of how to write that. The key point here was to do some work every day without necessarily having a grand overall vision in one&#x27;s head of what needs to be done - because you could wait ages for that to come, and the longer you wait the less inspired you feel. So if you&#x27;re programming and you don&#x27;t have an idea for your project, you can still find things to do - comment one of your other projects although that&#x27;s very tedious, or implement quicksort in a language you haven&#x27;t used before, or whatever. If you&#x27;re a painter and you don&#x27;t have an idea for a picture, fill up pages in your sketchbook with studies of your laundry basket or something.<p>(Incidentally, I also threw a few $ at a new piece of software that had fewer features than my existing word processor but a nicer UI. Don&#x27;t blame your tools for your problems, but don&#x27;t use tools you don&#x27;t like.)<p>The key point here which took me years to learn, is not to worry about the larger picture. Even if at the end of the year I had 365 one-page fragments that didn&#x27;t connect together, that in itself would be interesting. <i>Needing a big idea to feel motivated is a trap.</i> You cannot coast along on a wave of intellectual excitement all the time; all waves break and if you rely on the wave then you&#x27;re like a surfer who can&#x27;t swim. So on days when you don&#x27;t have a good idea of what to do, do something shitty.<p>The first month was horrible. Agonizing. After a couple of weeks I started adapting a short story I liked in order to get <i>some</i> sense of progress and offset the misery of staring into a creative void every time I sat down. That helped, somewhat. Then one day I read something interesting (on HN in fact), jotted down a single sentence about it because it sounded like it would make a good story, and went off to play with the dog. 10 weeks alter, I have the 3rd draft of a feature film. When I got stuck I&#x27;d work on the story adaptation I mentioned earlier, and if I got really stuck I&#x27;d write commercials for imaginary products and services (some of which will get recycled into a comedy project). Accepting the need to just &#x27;start over&#x27; every day has been a big part of that. Even if I wrote 10 pages yesterday, I still have to crank one out today and it might be crap.

Not just because NFS one of the oldest protocols, but because of the nature of the NFS abstraction.  Fundamentally, software that assumes a filesystem is shared,  globally mounted, and read/write is very hard to adapt to a cloud solution.  Many times, it requires re-writing the software, or coming up with a NFS shim (such as a FUSE solution) that is so underperforming it blocks usage.<p>If AWS implements this correctly, this could provide the cost/performance balance to potentially move such a solution completely to AWS.  This would eliminate not just large amounts of physical overhead for these companies, but the productivity costs that come with the downtime that inevitably occurs when you don&#x27;t have good redundancy.<p>These companies (and the industries they comprise) are trying to find out how best to leverage Amazon.  Recently, even more conservative industries, such as Law, are becoming more aware of AWS and other cloud-based solutions.  Lets hope that solutions like this, that bridge the old with the new, can empower that transition so we can all feel better about how our software is managed.",1428611323

Good companies to work for are any that 1) do something you are interested in. 2) Don&#x27;t require you to work longer than 40 hours a week.<p>The problem I see is big companies, and startups is the amount time they require their employees to work, which is normally over 40 hours and can be upwards of 60 hours average per week.<p>Paying 100k at 40 hours a week is $48 an hour.<p>Paying 100k at 60 hours a week is $32 an hour.<p>I work with undergrads always tell my best students to avoid Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Google companies. Longer hours means more stress. Big companies get employees to work longer by offering food and games at work. I tell them find a company that does cool stuff and only asks for 40 hours a week. I tell them I know working for interesting research companies getting paid $80k and working ~30 hours a week. Which is getting paid more per hour than the person working at a company earning 100k and doing 60 hours per week.<p>I checked up and Google isn&#x27;t too bad from what I can see online.

Needless to say, all the predators (bear, wolves and lynx, mostly) are dead, while the useful food animals (red deer, roe deer) run wild.<p>The end result is devastation. It looks beautiful, but ecologically it&#x27;s awful: there&#x27;s a huge deer overpopulation, and they eat everything. Trees won&#x27;t regenerate because saplings don&#x27;t survive. Without trees the entire bottom of the ecosystem is missing, and without treeroots holding the tiny amount of soil together, it turns into mush.<p>If you spend a night out in the Scottish wilderness, even in the middle of summer it&#x27;s _dead silent_. If there&#x27;s water nearby you might hear a curlew. Occasional skylarks. You&#x27;ll also probably hear the weird grunting of a herd of red deer across the glen. Contrast with Norway, where every flat surface is covered with dwarf birch and dwarf spruce, and there&#x27;s birdsong everywhere...<p>(You do get Forestry Commission forests of Norwegian spruce. These are even worse; the trees are grown commercially, they&#x27;re extremely fast growing, usually planted way too close together, they&#x27;re clear cut every decade or so, and they&#x27;re utterly barren. Not even the deer will go in.)<p>Every now and again you&#x27;ll find a small area that&#x27;s well fenced off enough to keep the deer out, and it&#x27;ll be full of trees. But a massive, nationwide cull of deer is politically impossible (I know one estate owner who&#x27;s received hate mail for culling the deer on his estate, as required by law). There are some attempts to reintroduce wolves, but people are understandably a bit leery. Lynx may be viable: apparently they&#x27;re not big enough to pose much of a threat to the deer, but will at least keep them moving, which will help solve some of the overgrazing problem.<p>There&#x27;s also a lot more awareness these days, with more fencing and planting, but it&#x27;s all piecemeal, and it usually doesn&#x27;t happen on the high moors and hillsides which are the most at risk.<p>So, um, yeah.

Could you expand on what it is you find problematic about that sort of question, eg lay out what your thought process is and where it gets blocked?<p>In terms of suggestions, maybe it would be worth your while considering problems a bit outside the programming domain, and working on them someplace other than your desk, on the theory that a change is as good as rest. Martin Gardner&#x27;s &#x27;Mathematical Recreations&#x27; columns for Scientific American were collected into one or more books, and I think some of Ian Stewarts&#x27; as well. These are great because they comprise fairly abtruse problems along with a discussion of strategies for dealing with them.<p>There are of course lots of &#x27;math pouzzle of the week&#x27; sites from various universities, and books of math puzzles. but you should definitely pick up &#x27;How to solve it&#x27; by Georg Polya, which is considered a classic education text. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/How-Solve-It-Mathematical-Princeton/dp/069111966X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/How-Solve-It-Mathematical-Princeton/dp...</a> This is over half a century old but it&#x27;s a great book, it&#x27;s like having a patient mathematics teacher that wants to help you succeed at your side. Again, study these things away from your desk - find some other study space, even a park, and practice working with paper and in your head. You will retain things better by changing your environment for study.<p>Another thing that strikes me about your post is that your abilities are affected by the situation - you feel confident of your ability to get things done when allowed space to think, but you don&#x27;t deal well with high-pressure environments like interviews. This is normal. Build up a good idea of where your intellectual strengths and weaknesses are and what your best strategies for dealing with them are. Don&#x27;t be afraid to say in an interview &#x27;I&#x27;m good at this sort of problem, I&#x27;m always slow at that sort so my first response will be a few brain farts...&#x27; Remember too that in a good interview, you&#x27;re not just being rated for your raw intellectual ability, but on how you deal with your limitations and how you go about decomposing a problem. Nobody knows everything!<p>Lastly, don&#x27;t assume you must do it in isolation. Maybe part of the stress at interviews is not the questions themselves but the social context. If you can afford it, consider hiring a graduate student in math or CS at a local university to tutor you a few hours a week. A person with an academic leaning will be better equipped to assess and direct your learning ability than someone who is trying to solve the &#x27;puzzle&#x27; of filling an open position at a company and who can only provide limited feedback on your performance.",1428609944

A tiny, expendable drone won&#x27;t be able to carry a 500lb bomb.<p>Range is another consideration. As you shrink aircraft, their range generally shrinks too. Your 10,000 single-use drones probably won&#x27;t be able to fly across the Pacific.<p>Smaller, cheaper, and more numerous may well be better, but it&#x27;s all relative.<p>Incidentally, this basic scenario already played out for strategic nuclear bombing. The &quot;drones&quot; there are ballistic missiles, and they gradually supplanted manned bombers in large part because they were cheaper. (Being able to launch on short notice and extremely difficult to intercept were factors too, of course.) Manned nuclear bombers still exist, but are very much secondary to ICBMs now. But note that ICBMs, while quite a bit smaller and cheaper than a B-52 or B-2, are still gigantic and expensive compared to just about anything civilian scale.",1428609902

Of the several hundred people I felt I knew reasonably well at Intel and Sun through the folks I&#x27;ve interacted with at Xerox and Tandem where my wife worked. LinkedIn&#x27;s mapping function gives me pretty good coverage but the simple sample of is/is-not retired isn&#x27;t a good signal.<p>But the other part which isn&#x27;t obvious is that a number of people at Sun (for example) were not millionaires when the company IPO&#x27;d but became millionaires as the stock increased in value. In a case which is perhaps unique but not unprecedented, the Sun stock I purchased as part of the employee purchase program (basically 10% of my salary buying stock at 85% of the fair market value every 6 months) over 10 years was worth more than a million dollars in 1999[1] Similarly for folks who &quot;only&quot; had $500K worth of stock when Facebook IPO&#x27;d that same stock would be > $1.5M today.<p>The dynamic (which was also well documented in Geoffrey Moore&#x27;s books) is that companies that make it to an IPO and grow, add value over time and their relative value at a size of <= 1000 employees, to their size at 10,000 employees makes the equity compensation of those 1000 employees a lot more valuable than the later employees got.<p>And to reiterate the data is out there but not well collated. I&#x27;ll have to do some more digging to figure out if we can quantify this more precisely.<p>[1] Not that I still had it in 1999 but there were folks who did.",1428609897

Am I successful now? Because I published my second book last month, some think I am successful. But I feel like I am only getting &quot;warmed up&quot; and, at best, I am at 30-50% of my potential. Do I compare myself to others and feel regret? I do. For example, I look at what Eric Ries has accomplished. I admire him a lot, and I think he deserves all the success he has achieved, but ask myself why I didn&#x27;t do more in my 30s. Another person I admire is Nir Eyal. Seeing what he&#x27;s accomplished, I wonder why I didn&#x27;t do more in my 20s and 30s! Actually, I got to interview Nir a few months ago, and discovered he&#x27;s a normal human being, not a superhuman creature.<p>Here&#x27;s some advice. (BTW, my training and expertise is in industrial-organizational psychology. It&#x27;s not clinical psychology but the psychology of: individual performance, team performance, motivation, engagement, etc.)<p>Plenty of successful people struggle with self-doubt, self-criticism, and anxiety. For example, I struggled with depression in my 20s. Whatever your pain, it is your cross to bear. Learn to manage your condition, and you will become a stronger person, and better able to help others who struggle like you did.<p>Learn to deal with setbacks and disappointments without freaking out. Learn to meet adversity and hardships with equanimity -- with an even mind. Keep driving towards your goal but be ready to change your plans as you go. When I was 34, my dad died quite suddenly. It was terrible. But from that hardship, I decided to take action toward my goal of becoming a management consultant. I started down that new path. Three years later, I got my Masters degree in industrial-organizational psychology, and was excited about starting my new career. Weeks after my graduation, our youngest child was diagnosed with a chronic condition for which there is no cure. I had to change my plans around for four years mostly because I needed to learn to care for my daughter. She&#x27;s doing well today because we put her health and well-being first.<p>Self-compassion is important. You can be compassionate with yourself while continuing to work and get progress made each week. You may want a coach or a professional counselor to help you sort through this.<p>Some will tell you to &quot;have no regrets at all&quot; because they want to help -- ie. get you to stop worrying so much. Actually research tells us that some degree of regret can serve a useful purpose. The problem is overwhelming regret and shame. Again, the solution and antidote to all of this is self-acceptance and self-compassion.<p>If you want to be successful, the research points to success being determined by how many people you help to become successful, and how much talent you multiply in others in your community of peers and your network. Look at ways to keep improving your own skills but help others get more skilled and successful too. Read the book &quot;Give and Take&quot; by Adam Grant.<p>Last but not least, you can&#x27;t stop your mind from comparing your achievements to others. But you can learn to observe your mind and your thinking, without &quot;buying into it&quot; or being a slave to that train of thought. Take a course in mindfulness meditation. You have many good years ahead of you.",1428609835

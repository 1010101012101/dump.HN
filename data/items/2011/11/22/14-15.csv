Even <i>if</i> it weren't absolutely nuts to put every-package-and-extension-known-to-man inside a iOS binary, it still wouldn't be right. Like, what if I want LaTeX2HTML (I've never not had to highly tweak this)? What about my snazzy custom fonts? That bibliography style that only one journal accepts and requires these crufty old stys from 2.09?<p>If I needed LaTeX on a daily, here's what I would do:<p>1. Install DropBox on my mobile device and a designated ""build"" box--maybe just your home computer or an EC2 micro.<p>2. Set up Jenkins on a box that's got your favorite LaTeX environment and create a job that takes your LaTeX source files, builds and outputs your desired formats and pops them into an output folder you created on DropBox.<p>3. Set a build trigger that runs a build every time you touch a specific ""ready to build"" file.<p>4. Edit and write LaTeX source files on your mobile device using an app that syncs with DropBox like PlainText.<p>5. Increment something in your ""build trigger"" file.<p>6. Et voila, check the DropBox app on your mobile device for output and log files. :)",1321973967

If a particular stretch of highway can support 80MPH, set the limit to 80.

To consider even the most simple counter points makes the article entirely feeble. (Does the author believe ad-supported apps are unique to the marketplace?)<p>iOS's high revenue isn't chance:\nThe iOS store is a stronger performer due to not only a better demographic positioning, but it's an extension of the worlds largest music store, it's a longer-term cultivation, it's run by a company with very-high consumer trust, apple seed programs and provide continuous incentives for developers, apple's yields massive advertising and events programs and apple's incredibly high penetration due to inclusion with iTunes and installation on all iOS devices, are each very strong reasons on it's own.<p>Meanwhile, those factors do make it a popular choice for developers who are wanting mainstream consumers, but this doesn't leave android in the dark. Android can tout greater variance/complexity of applications due to more lax regulation by google. Such as porn, apps that are counter the OS's UX, apps that reproduce functionality or overtake certain OS features and of course simple apps.<p>Millions of increasingly fragmented Android devices out there will not make the marketplace more attractive to developers.

3265695,comment,3264736,3264736,2,0,tibbon,,,"Speed limits really should be more self regulating. The driver should be skilled enough to know at what safe speed they can drive. If they cannot determine this speed, they should stop driving or at least slow down.<p>I ride a motorcycle, and often the 'safe speed' for me is far different than other vehicles on the road. Sometimes its faster, and sometimes its slower. When I'm on a big highway in the mountains (4 lanes each way), I can probably get my bike to go up, down and around hills far faster than your average car can on the road. Up by Cleveland there are some signs about 'sharp turns' on the highway and say they should be taken at 25mph. I can easily do them at 50mph, and that isn't even really leaning in hard.<p>Yet, other times, I go significantly more slowly, especially at night, in the rain or in fog. There's some road (22?) I take back from Pittsburgh to Columbus, and in the summer between the fog, the bugs, the corners and the darkness, I often find myself going 20mph on a road that is marked at 55mph during the day. I use my own judgement here and slow down, and pull over to let cars past me.<p>In the past 13 years I've been driving, I've never gotten a speeding ticket, and I have never been in any wreck with another vehicle (and never rode my bike off the road). To the letter of the law, surely I've deserved a few tickets; yet, I've driven safely and I feel that I'm well trained and always ride within my ability.<p>As a side note, I feel that motorcycling overall has made me more aware and able of driving all vehicles. I'm infinitely more aware than anyone else on the road, and I think much more about what's right for me safety-wise, and not just what the roads say.",1321973779

The result has been a dramatic reduction in speeding.  I'm not sure if road safety has improved or not since the change, but since I have taken the same way to/from work 5 days a week for 15 years, I can say I haven't seen any increase or decrease in accidents, personally.  What I have noticed is a dramatic change in driving behavior.  When the limit was 55 MPH, the majority of traffic was going at least 60 with a sizable minority of traffic working very hard to get around those doing 60.<p>From my personal perspective, 70 MPH feels fast enough.  It probably feels that way because I'm not being tailgated at that speed, nor do I feel like I'd have to slow down to take a bend in the road at that speed (my understanding is that the highways in Michigan are designed to be driven safely at 75 MPH in reasonable weather conditions).  By casual observation, most people are driving between 65 and 75 MPH outside of rush hour.",1321973644

To find out that it is also efficient was just unbelievable. I'd been doing Clojure for two years already I don't think it really hit me what Lisp had to offer until I spent nearly 6 months understanding those <i>mere 200 lines</i> and reimplementing them in Clojure.<p>Having Dan and Will around to bounce ideas off at the Clojure/conj was simply incredible. One thing I've disliked about the miniKanren system is that many finite programs do not terminate depending on where the recursion occurs. Dan & Will have been working on that problem for <i>8 years</i>.<p>Being the unprincipled fool that I am I decided to tackle this problem head on. Over the past weekend I implemented a version of miniKanren that not only terminates now for an incredible number of programs (it implements fair conjunction), but it does so without sacrificing miniKanren's excellent sequential performance when you so desire it.<p>So for me, yes modern programs should be written in Lisp.

That way, if you're using an algorithm whose outputs are pathologically sensitive to small variations in their inputs (or in intermediate results), you're likely to be able to tell because the final results will differ by more than a few bits in the lowest places.<p>Unfortunately, support for doing this is lacking in most programming languages and environments.

They do it in a very casual kind of way, you know, ""mind if I take a quick look around the front seat of your car?"". If you know what is coming, you should say ""no, I don't consent to a search"". Then they tell you they'll bring in the drug dogs, so might as well let them as they'll ""go easy on you"". You still refuse.<p>So now you are going to get punished because you are not cooperative.

3265592,comment,3263767,3264252,5,0,vidarh,,,"Personally I interpret a large part of acceptance as stopping the endless stream of ""what-if?""'s and doubt and stress and fear surrounding what happens in our lives.<p>When faced with an event, ruminating endlessly about what might have been if you did X instead of Y, or worrying about what might come next stops you from actually being free to focus your attention where you want it: On what deliberate action you should be taking, and on enjoying the good things in your life.<p>And that might have the effect of inaction in many cases. For ""common people in that country"" you mentioned it might very well be that on consideration an uprising was far down the list of what actually mattered to their lives. I don't know what impact it had on their day to day lives, and how that measures up with other things, such as caring for their families and making a decent living. Or maybe ""acceptance"" had nothing to do with it and they were just scared.<p>But priorities shift once you take a more deliberate view and are not driven by anguish about a situation but about considering carefully what actually matters to you.<p>A simple example:<p>You look at the clock, and realize you're late. There's no way you can make it to where you were meant to be in time.<p>You can choose to get stressed out and frantic, but it's already too late - you won't change that, all you achieve is to be stressed out and frantic and running around like a headless chicken while life passes you by.<p>Does it matter if you're late?<p>Maybe it does,  but it still doesn't help to stress out about it when you should instead focus on what the best course of action is. Perhaps it is as simple as a phone call to let someone know you will be late. Perhaps you miss a train, but can just take a later one. Why stress over it? Even <i>if</i> being late is a disaster, the stress achieves nothing. It is unhelpful and just makes things worse. So you accept that you will be late and take deliberate action to minimize the impact of being late, and you accept the consequences you can't mitigate rather than make things worse by feeling sorry for yourself.<p>Maybe it doesn't matter, and you should just breathe calmly and accept that you will be late and since it's not such a big deal you proceed as you otherwise would and enjoy your walk wherever you were headed and take in the view and enjoy the nice day. Maybe you won't look at the clock in the first place, because you know it does not really matter what time it is.<p>Most things people get terribly worked up over are never worth caring much about in the first place, yet we get worked up and stressed out and make stupid mistakes or feel miserable for no good reason. Focus your attention and energy on the things that <i>are</i> worth caring about, and even then try to make a clear distinction between deliberate action and feelings or actions that are not helpful.",1321971918

All copies of books on the list were confiscated and destroyed; the possession of a book on the list was made a punishable offense. All the millions of copies of these books were to be confiscated and destroyed. The representative of the Military Directorate admitted that the order was in principle no different from the Nazi book burnings.<p>The censorship in the U.S. zone was regulated by the occupation directive JCS 1067 (valid until July 1947) and in the May 1946 order valid for all zones (rescinded in 1950), Allied Control Authority Order No. 4, ""No. 4 - Confiscation of Literature and Material of a Nazi and Militarist Nature"".

Tiger moms are finding that they are having to turn into soccer moms to get their kids into Harvard.<p>To the firms that make a point of selecting graduates from these schools, this kind of acceptance criteria ensures that they'll be able to get as much grindwork as possible out of recent grads when they hire them. They know that they can squeeze 80-100 hours a week out of these folks, churning out endless slide decks and grinding numbers on spreadsheets without actually having to put any sort of intelligence to work.<p>Or to put it another way. If the SAT were really all that important, and considering the SAT's positive correlation with IQ (I think it's around .8), wouldn't the schools just accept an IQ test instead?<p>(note: you are correct in not calling the measure of IQ ""smartness"", it reflects capacity not the current state of intelligence)",1321971046

Scala is the first language that i've learned where at first i couldn't just read code and immediately guess what it does.<p>I think the prime reason for this is that scala permits operator overloading; more than that, in fact, almost every character can be an identifier. This results in often very cryptic code and libraries, because you can't guess what that function does without reading its definition. quick, what's the difference between +++ and ::: ? what's /: and /:\ ?  You can't even google it!<p>The other big problem for me was the type system. At first it sounded really great, and in fact the amount of compile-time code verification that you can achieve is indeed impressive. But in practice, i found myself fighting with the type system a lot, for example when trying to reuse a function with generic type restrictions that I had't written: some time these can get very long and your only choice is to copy-paste them from the original definition.<p>Also, how do you test that your type constraints are correct? you can't, by definition, write compilable code that would invalidate them.<p>Finally, it turns out that a lot of the bad stuff that's in java ends up in scala also, because of runtime compatibility concerns. in particular, scala's generics are an extension of java's. so, for example, almost all generic type information is lost at runtime, except for some extra metadata that scala stores in the object. this results in pretty ugly code when you have a dynamic object and you need to use it with a generic method.",1321970907

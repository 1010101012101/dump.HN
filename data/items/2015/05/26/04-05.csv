Unless they are operating out of altruism, they will need to charge money, inject ads, steal data, or some combination of the above.<p>2) If the usage pattern is primarily about internet connectivity, rather than local communication, then the nodes nearest the ISP would quickly become saturated with traffic.<p>3) If people can modify the software on their radios (and mesh networking is a very popular idea with the Free Software community) then they are Free not to waste their own resources altruistically forwarding traffic for others. You would need to design the incentive structure carefully. Probably some combinations of micro-payments, surge pricing/auction, and bitcoin. Otherwise a simple reputation system (bad &quot;seed ratio&quot;-type metric, no connectivity).<p>4) The big one. Mesh networking bridges the gap when you have A->B and B->C but not A->C. But if you are in a challenging enough RF environment that you don&#x27;t have A->C then you probably don&#x27;t have A->B and B->C either. RF is barely usable (if at all) without line of sight, and putting a repeater in the sky is a rock-solid method of getting line of sight. Hence it is the basis for all wide-area RF communications systems. Mesh improves upon certain arrangements of $35 Motorola FRS handhelds, but not all of them (whereas &quot;repeater in the sky&quot; architectures are unfazed).<p>Peer-to-peer RF is cool when you are in RF-friendly environments doing mostly peer-to-peer traffic (not access to an ISP). It works in the places where it has always worked, where handheld radios without repeaters have always been useful. Protests and disaster recovery efforts are two such examples. Internet connectivity for the masses is a different beast.",1432615937

What would a &quot;doomsday&quot; created by adblock actually look like?<p>All the ad-supported content mills will disappear overnight. Most ad-supported &quot;social&quot; services will probably also shut down, and the remainder will have to adopt a paid subscription model. Even Google will have to pivot very hard, whereas Apple and Microsoft will be mostly okay. Facebook and Twitter are probably fucked. The NSA will panic at first, but they&#x27;ll find plenty of other ways to tap into people&#x27;s lives soon enough.<p>Meanwhile, individual bloggers who just write for the sake of it will be largely unaffected, and will probably continue to produce quality content because they were never in it for the money anyway. Since they don&#x27;t have to compete with content mills, they might get even more readers.<p>Centralized social networking services will be replaced with distributed nodes run by volunteers around the world. Many people will spend their own time and money to contribute, while others might run an exclusive club for paying customers. Who knows, maybe this will lead to an explosive growth of micropayment services as well.<p>Does that sound like the good ol&#x27; 90s? Yes! Let&#x27;s go back to the 90s and try again without advertising. Only this time, we have the technology to make distributed networks actually work. Moreover, the cost of an online presence has become so low compared to 20 years ago that most people in the developed world can afford to stream live video from their home using a fraction of their own disposable income, and well-organized charities will easily be able to bring the same benefits to those who have been less fortunate.<p>&quot;Sites need to make money&quot; is a big lie, perpetuated by the advertising industry. 99.99% of websites in this world don&#x27;t need to make money. Personal blogs don&#x27;t need to make money because the desire for self-expression is a fundamental human instinct and people who want to say things to the world will gladly pay their own money to post things online. E-commerce websites don&#x27;t need to make money <i>via advertising</i> because their purpose is to sell actual goods and services. Most corporate websites, likewise, don&#x27;t need to make money because they make real money elsewhere and the website is just a customer service portal. Content mills don&#x27;t need to make money, objectively speaking, because they don&#x27;t even have any right to exist.<p>Now that I&#x27;ve said it, I kinda want to see it happen. It will be the biggest disruption in the history of the Internet, but the Internet tends to treat disruptions as opportunities for progress.",1432615904

Not that he ever called it anything more than iirc &quot;wee&quot; but honestly I kind of expected that the sales and/or profit was more than what the sale page said and that assumes that sales have been going up and not down.<p>As far as the patio11 brand that only matters to people on HN nobody in the rest of the world cares about that at all. All they care about is what the business will make and what the product is and what they see as the potential.

Of course, the downside to this method is that you need to implement something on your backend and pay for the bandwidth. But it&#x27;s there as a nuclear option if needed.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m guessing that the next wave of ad-configuration is going to ask content owners to proxy their content through the ad network, so that ad networks act like a CDN and inject ads as a wrapper around content.",1432613667

There&#x27;s other relatively higher likelihood events that could cause modern civilization to collapse, like pandemics, runaway global warming, etc. You don&#x27;t need an asteroid impact to destroy modern civilization, so the list of threats is longer -- any threat that kills billions, or causes critical failure of institutions (an extremely destructive global war), or destroys the ability to build large scale, stable civilizations. It isn&#x27;t just about lives either, it&#x27;s about protecting the institutions that are a critical part of modern civilization and that requires protecting lives plus other stuff, so it&#x27;s even more fragile.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m considering &#x27;moving to Mars&#x27; against &#x27;staying on Earth and rebuilding&#x27;. You could totally rebuild on Earth and also have a separate colony on Mars that&#x27;s self sufficient and not affected by the same disaster. I&#x27;m saying you could gain an ability to survive threats that you couldn&#x27;t otherwise if you stayed only on Earth. If something destroyed modern civilization on Earth, well guess what, if you have a self sufficient colony on Mars, modern civilization would not have been completely destroyed.<p>There&#x27;s other benefits too. Developing tech to survive independently on another planet, ability to transport non-trivial materials to another planet, getting access to the nearby material wealth (autonomous asteroid mining perhaps? spit balling), and all that new science and technology and trade and opportunity for international collaboration.

This is in fact the main problem.<p>Motors consume a lot of energy - in fact electric motors consume more than 2/3 of produced electricity - this is manufacturing, transportation, even most of the electricity consumed by computers goes to power cooling ventilators.<p>Electric Quadrocopters usually have flight times measured in minutes - and they carry a heavy accumulator, maybe a third or half their weight.

3305424,comment,3303796,3304464,8,0,antr,,,"I am in Switzerland, and I download stuff, but I am not a pirate, I am a ghost. I am not doing anything ilegal.<p>Here is my philosophy towards (primarily movie) piracy, and what piracy really is. As far I am concerned, to the eyes of the US Movie industry I am an inexistent customer:<p>- When US movie/tv industry first releases content they only focus on the US. Consequently they discriminate (they have the right to do so) against potential non-US consumers. It takes weeks/months to get that content in Switzerland.<p>- The imported US content, when in Switzerland is translated (French/German). I am not interested in translated content as much of the context/msg is lost in translation. I do the same with books, magazines, etc.<p>- Given that it is practically impossible to pay for the content released in the US from Europe, and the quality (translation) of it has decreased, I am no longer a potential customer; better said, I have become a ghost. I am not being targeted/catered by this industry.<p>The problem is not with consumers downloading content. The problem is that studios/producers, etc. have not got a business that serves these people.<p>I do not download music, I don't need to. I have Spotify, Grooveshark and iTunes that cater my needs. I am willing to consume that content. On the other hand no company is serving my movie/TV needs, hence I am not a customer nor a pirate. I am a ghost.",1322855816

I'm near the top of my class in med school and my girlfriend is similar. We have a 4 year old daughter as well. I'm currently working on my startup and keeping my girlfriend happy.<p>Some tips:
- Weekends are not for your startup. Weekends are for your wife and kids. I work on my startup after I finish putting my daughter to sleep at 8:30pm. I finish working by 11pm or midnight.<p>- Your wife is going to be the one picking up your slack. Make your life easier by making her life easier. For me that means taking on more responsibility around the house(I'm vigilant about dishes, cleaning the bathroom, and doing laundry). I do this stuff as soon as I get home so she can play with our daughter instead of doing housework. This keeps my girlfriend's stress levels down and makes my startup seem less burdensome.  
- Take on tasks that require you to sit around for long periods of time. Today I took our car to get serviced and coded in the waiting area.",1322855679

I'm curious as to the precise moral dimension you're talking about here.<p>2. You're kidding yourself if you think you can stop it, or that by plugging your ears and closing your eyes you can make it all go away.<p>Most of your argument seems to be that because artists rely on selling copies now, that it must always be so. The fact is, artistic expression predates copying technology. Art fits into the technological capabilities that exist, not the other way around. Before image copying tech, artists made paintings, drawings, and sculptures, and sold them. There were other business models as well, like private and religious patronage. In ancient times, oral poets travelled and essentially gave live concerts. Dramatists had state sponsorship. Many of these business models and even entire mediums died out as our technology changed. That's what happens.<p>Maybe authors as we know them will figure out a way to survive, or maybe they'll die out. Same goes for filmmakers, musicians or any other artists. There's nothing special about the particular art forms we have now.<p>I keep talking vaguely about alternative business models because we're at a transition point. They haven't been invented yet.<p>""Nobody's going to invent an ingenious new way of making money out of music. There's live performance or there's selling intellectual property.

WL is part of a new kind of journalistic movement, it's not an anthropological organization.<p>The credibility of WL depends on it's willingness to be transparent about its processes and to let anyone who reads the fine print determine that the PR headline was fundamentally accurate.  The need to even write headlines presupposes that 5-7 words can offer the gist of what the full document states.  It's absurd to think that an unbiased headline could possibly exist, it's just a question of what the headline writer thinks is important.<p>Incidentally, this is the same credibility metric that I'd apply to governments, which WL is helping to usher in by offering a way to measure government claims with a BS-o-meter to reveal what was propaganda and artifice intended to make people draw specific conclusions.<p>It's up to the reader to figure out the truth, but the pretense of 100% neutrality is overrated.  Think about it, lots of people believe that major newspapers are neutral.  The key is that WL provides the raw data so that over time it can earn credibility. This is something that even the most respected newspapers refuse to do.<p>Even though I'm generally a supporter of WL, I'm the first to admit that its PR approach began as naive and has progressed to what I'd call ""emotional"".

And in the music industry, lesser-know bands profit most from the sampling effect of file-sharing.""<p>Hate to burst the bubble, but this is a pretty stupid conclusion if you're trying to advocate for piracy. People who download more tend to buy more. Why is this surprising? Obviously, the people who download more are the same people who <i>care</i> more about entertainment, so of course these are also the people who'll pay more.<p>That is absolutely irrelevant to the discussion of whether piracy is a net benefit. It's mixing up causation with correlation. Download more pirate content is <i>not</i> causing people to go to more concerts - the people who would ""naturally"" go to more concerts are the same people who would ""naturally"" buy more music, but are now simply downloading more music.<p>Note: Or at least, that's another theory, which is also the correct one in my opinion.

Coding experience is required since we will need to develop a product, though you don't necessarily have to be EECS. One Engineer and one Design student would also be great.<p>Process: 
If interested please contact me at: throwaway4hn@gmail.com and we can talk more, both on or off campus, to see if there is any interest/synergy.

(Even though you can argue that having your email displayed exposes an attack vector).<p>Public info makes it much easier to recover a domain. And proper security on the email is required as always obviously.<p>I've helped several people recover domains by going to contacts I have at ICANN. Not having public info doesn't give me what I need to make a case. It's a non-starter many times. And it just confuses the issue for you as well when you are trying to correct things.<p>Registrars (we don't offer privacy by the way) want privacy because it is a) something they can offer and charge for and b) allows them to lock the customer in and create a barrier to exit. c) Many of them do this by changing ownership to them for the domain and giving you a contract that you are the beneficial owner. Not good for you. You want and need to be owner according to whois. (Read this again.)<p>If you want a private domain use a po box or a work address etc or your uncles's address. If you are a business you absolutely have no reason to have privacy (and many many businesses do because they have been sold some bullshit on this with respect to spam).",1322852857

They think that Zynga is nothing but people refining skinner boxes for people to play in.  You've probably seen one or two talks of Mark Pincus talking about ""doing every dirty trick in the book"" or something like that.  Have you ever met him?

Is that stigma justified? Absolutely not. There are plenty of other reasons not to like developing at Zynga most people don't talk about:<p>* Zynga is not a technology company first.  This means that product & revenue decisions are always prioritized over innovating tech.  Most developers aren't comfortable with companies like that.<p>* Zynga isn't accepted as a legit member of ""games companies""  circles.  You can't tell your buddy who works building a PC MMO or console FPS that you're in games because you work at Zynga.  You'll get laughed out of the room.<p>* Developers are not decision makers at Zynga.  Product managers and game designers call all the shots.  So if you're writing code, you're not really ""making games"" in the traditional sense, you're just implementing someone else's spec.<p>So is Zynga the best place for a dev to work in the valley? It isn't the worst.  You'll make more money and get more perks than you would working at a startup, but it won't be personally fulfilling.  Do you spend all day scheming ways to exploit people?

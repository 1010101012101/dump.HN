543512,comment,543431,543431,0,0,calambrac,,,"The frustrating thing about this for me is that I liked Get Satisfaction.  It's a really well-done site, for the most part, and it was easy and convenient.  I had never used it deeply, and only for services that were actually using it as their primary support channel, so I didn't even realize that they had pages for companies that hadn't signed up with them.<p>All the GS pages look pretty much identical, save for a few logos.  After a while, you blow past the repeated boilerplate on each page, and you just use the functionality.  I was one of the people who would never have noticed the small distinctions between official and unofficial; I would have thought any GS page was sanctioned by the company, because frankly, it never would have even entered my mind that GS would so brazenly try to unilaterally pose as a company's support channel.<p>This is exactly the kind of thing that trademarks are intended to protect against.  I hate to say it, but all the hand-wringing over whether 37s was being rude by dropping a bomb of a blog post, is kind of silly.  It could have very legitimately been a bomb of a lawsuit.",1238687700

543509,comment,543431,543433,0,0,mdasen,,,"The problem is that morality comes into competition with money in this situation.  The more legitimate and official and connected to the company Get Satisfaction makes their pages look, the more customers are going to use them as a way to try to get official-ish support.  The more users use them as a way to get support, the more pressure there is on the company to use it as a support mechanism - whether they want to or not.<p>Even beyond that, Get Satisfaction is essentially operating an unofficial forum that a company can pay to co-opt.  Their paid plans specifically say that you get to shape the conversation.  How Orwellian!  So, you'll let users post bad things about my company on your service unless I start paying you in which case I get to decide what gets posted?  That's just gross on both sides.  And, of course, the more official it looks, the more it matters when people are posting bad things.  Plus, once a company starts endorsing it, more customers will use it meaning that they can never stop paying.<p>There's a huge moral hazard there.  If their business plan were to offer an unofficial support system for all companies, that would be great.  If their business plan were to offer a product companies could sign up for to outsource their support IT infrastructure, that would be great.  But their business plan is to offer the first in the hopes that companies will feel pressure to do the second.<p>EDIT: I want to clarify that I don't think Get Satisfaction is maliciously plotting in this way.  I'm guessing that their plotting is to give customers the best support channels possible - in cases that they can be official, that means being official, but in other cases, it means giving customers the chance to unofficially talk about the company/products.  However, it also means that their profits become tied to whether companies feel pressure to make Get Satisfaction an official support mechanism and the more people that use it because it looks official-ish, the more their profits are likely to be.",1238687619

He doesn't even mention the ""Popular products & services from 37signals"", where GS uses 37S's product logos as category links.  Nor does he mention the fact that one of the two bits of GS branding on the page is a ""Powered by"" icon that an unfamiliar person would mistake for server software - or a service.  Go to that page, and the word ""Unofficial"" and a small-print disclaimer are your only tip-offs that this is a ""community"".<p>The bad part of it all is that there's <i>no</i> need or justification at all for designing a customer support page that looks that official and target-company-branded <i>if it isn't</i>.

What they don't mention is that the savings account pays significantly less interest than the inflation rate and that the average consumer spends over 10% more when using a card than cash holding all else equal.

Now, we know as a company that years ago, we didn’t offer the same support we offer now. But I also know that I reply to EVERY email for support we receive, and I’ve done so for 2 years now. Two months ago, we hired Michael as our second support person, so we can reply with even more timely and more informative emails.</i><p><i>We scoured our records and found no trace of his email. I had our system administrator manually search our incoming mail logs and found nothing. Finally, the customer himself pointed me to the GS page he had created to ask 37signals a question. I was dumbfounded. Angry. Extremely, beyond belief, upset by this.</i><p><i>Customer support is my job, and I take it very seriously, and I am very, very good at it. To have another website undermine that job which leads to a customer with 1) a bad experience, 2) a bad impression of our company, 3) a bad impression of my work…well, it’s infuriating. Not only was I angry on the customer’s behalf, I was angry on behalf of our company to see our name and logo plastered all over a site we had never known about until then. (After that, there were two identical incidents over the past year.)</i><p><i>So that’s how we found out. Our frustration isn’t new, and it’s not unfounded. It’s based purely on the bad experiences GS has caused for our customers, and the harm it’s caused our brand. I’ve been friends with GS’s co-founder Lane Becker for years, and I don’t think he has sour intentions at all.

I'm not an active Hulu user but I did just give it a try and watched about 5 minutes of Family Guy without incident; your mileage may vary.<p>Originally, I picked it up just to satisfy my inner geek and thought it might be good for my 7 year old daughter.  On that score, it sucks because educational/kids games just can't handle the small screen.  I can play a mean game of desktop tower defense or a few goodoldgames.com games, but as a gaming machine, you'll be disappointed.<p>I use it mostly for surfing the web, skyping, and watching video while traveling, and it works great.  I bought a 3rd party battery off ebay and can literally run it for 6 hours watching video which covers most of the travel I've had to do.  When around the house, I tend to use it more than our other laptop; it's just so light and easy to carry from room to room, I prefer it for short stints of web surfing.<p>It's also fairly hackable; I have it running linux, winxp, and MacOS (although I did replace the wireless card to get it working properly).<p>My wife is going to give it a go for a couple weeks to see if she can effectively use it to replace her laptop at work.  With the slightly smaller keyboard and less than stellar mouse, I don't think it would be good for 8 hours of office work alone, but when connected to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, it might work for her and you can't beat how much lighter it is to lug around.<p>I think the sweet spot of the market is teens and college students who don't care about video gaming.  With it's long battery life and small size, it would be awesome for taking notes in class, and be good enough in a dorm room with an external monitor and keyboard, for most other non-gaming use.<p>You also can't beat the price albeit for $200 more or so, you can get a pretty decent laptop these days (or if you are like me and buy extra junk like a battery, external dvd reader, and a wifi card, it's almost a wash).",1238684708

The stories I have involve people of all ages too, <i>because a lot can change in a year</i>.<p>Third: Be open. Try new restaurants and see new movies. Join new clubs outside of programming (e.g., Chess, Go, mobile design, biking, whatever) This is important because it helps when striking up conversation when doing the next part.<p>Fourth: Grow your social networks. You don&#x27;t have to be best friends with everyone (and shouldn&#x27;t!) but having a bigger network does make things easier. With stuff from #3, you have higher odds of getting along with people.<p>Fifth: I&#x27;m not that old, so lots of people in this thread will have better advice than me, but you&#x27;d be surprised how far you&#x27;ll get with just those four items.

6312331,comment,6311212,6312228,3,0,saraid216,,,"> Most of the crime movies I like are based on real events.<p>Tell you what. Provide some examples so that I can actually work through one and explain how it could have been adequately feminist without detracting from your entertainment. It would be helpful if it has a Wikipedia article detailing the original real life inspiration, since I don&#x27;t know anything about this subject.<p>> Do you really suggest that authors should be obliged to cast at least 50% of roles as females even when it does not reflect the reality being portrayed?<p>Nope. As long as any females present in the movie are portrayed with equal realism, it&#x27;s fine. This is virtually never the case. I recently read a 2009 feminist critique of <i>The Wire</i> which noted that despite Snoop and Kima, females were depicted fairly poorly overall. I love <i>The Wire</i>. But they were right.<p>One of the biggest hurdles with feminism in entertainment is that the problem isn&#x27;t with <i>particular</i> movies. It&#x27;s that the <i>crushingly overwhelming majority</i> of the movies are sexist. So you find that no one is willing to be the first person to decide to not be sexist, because you&#x27;re breaking the mold. It wouldn&#x27;t be terrible if only, say, 20% of movies were sexist. But the percentage is closer to 90, 95.<p>Just like video games are only for boys, so of course they&#x27;re all male fantasies. Or comic books are only for boys, so of course they&#x27;re all male fantasies.",1378072544

As there&#x27;s nothing they know of that they can do to earn more income or improve their social status <i>in their current environment</i>, they <i>do</i> spend a large proportion of their time watching TV, or playing board games, or snoozing in the shade. The leisure time is real, but so is the lack of real earning opportunity and the certainty of dying - probably prematurely - as poor as the day they were born. And if all their kids survive to adulthood, there&#x27;ll be even less work to do but perhaps not enough land or other means of earning sustenance to go around...<p>The number of people <i>willingly</i> leaving those peaceful villages to work in appalling conditions for a couple of extra dollars a day in arguably futile pursuit of prosperity definitely outnumbers those moving in the opposite direction.",1378072209

6312283,comment,6309882,6312055,9,0,scarmig,,,"It&#x27;s true that most people do manage to consume a basket of goods costing at least as much as reasonable basic income levels. Even the homeless end up consuming many tens of thousands of dollars every year, in costs of health care and social services. (More, in fact, than the simply impoverished do.)<p>But that suggests a key point: the basket of goods and time that people consume while below the poverty line is not necessarily what they would choose to consume if they simply received some amount of money equivalent to what one could reasonably expect to survive on. For instance, a huge chunk of the money we ostensibly give to people goes to Medicaid, which effectively redirects aid to an expensive program that doesn&#x27;t even seem to improve health outcomes. What the money would flow into instead would cause inflation in those goods, but at the same time capital would flow to the production and provision of those same goods as more people were buying more of them. The net result is increased consumption of the replacement goods coupled with an increase in price somewhere between 0% and the percentage increase of the demand going for them. The exact value depends on elasticities and how many new ways capital can find to supply those goods.<p>There are welfare programs that do pass out real money, but they force a different kind of consumption: of time. Instead of consuming hours as an individual knows best, we ask them to send out dozens of ineffective applications. I don&#x27;t know if they even have good choices: maybe these people are just screwed. But I do know that they probably know a lot better about how to get out of their situation--<i>within the constraints of their particular levels of knowledge and self-control</i>--than I do.<p>There are also psychological aspects that are pretty important. Living in a constant state of staving off being kicked onto the street forces a focus on short-term thinking, at the expense of medium- and long-term thinking. This is more behavioral than micro economics, but it&#x27;s as real a factor as any other, and definitely changes what and how people choose to consume.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that I&#x27;ve left off all discussion of people above the basic income level (which, to be clear, I&#x27;m imagining as being around $10k), who constitute a significant majority of Americans. Two points I&#x27;d like to mention:<p>1) A lot of people fall into a benefits trap, where if they work they&#x27;ll be punished. Literally they face a greater than 100% tax rate. For people on disability, this can actually be from 1,000% to 10,000%. This is horrific from an economic point of view, and horrific from the perspective of human dignity and autonomy. A basic income is one way of totally removing those obstacles to participating in the labor force.<p>2) People at $40k and above theoretically shouldn&#x27;t be affected much by my suggested basic income, aside from a real but manageable tax hike. In practice, though, I suspect the behavioral aspect would be significant, if they know that they can quit their jobs without having to worry about bare minimum needs (though this is clearly just a strong suspicion on my part--I have difficulty imagining a good test for it). Instead of worrying about destroying their savings, they can go out and try new, risky ideas. I think we live in an era where there&#x27;s a great need for individual entrepreneurship in both monetizable and non-monetizable goods, so that&#x27;s something I embrace.",1378071613

This introduced me to the social circle of several people, especially second tier, friends of my coworkers. This had good crop of friends but not enough nor quality.<p>The second tactic I&#x27;ve took was dating women. Every woman I met in person I was proposing stuff, to do things, practically, this was my shameless attitude and gave many fruits, especially because Europeans love the active attitude to the passive one. Dating out with girls I met more friendly people, but the bad thing was that leaving the girl i was losing also mostly of their friends.<p>The third tactic was going to conferences and meetups small issues where I met people who liked the same thing to me, basically, is where most friends did and where I had more sexual adventures too :). Basically, after meetups I invited everyone to party at my flat, or dinner, the usual stuff europeans do.<p>After 11 years I can not complain, I feel supported by my friends.<p>What I learned is: learn more languages to speak the the most possible people and be open, relaxed and careless.

So I&#x27;m guessing its the equivalent of variable name or more likely memory address.<p>I have a gut level guess the 11000 series opcodes are some kind of ALU op.  Probably add.  And you can add a constant, and condition codes in the 2nd to last column do things based on add result.<p>Another gut level guess... you&#x27;re using signed ints and the last column is some kind of conditional jump and the OS lives in the upper half of memory which would be a negative number as per the last statement returning to the OS.  I think you put your global libraries in the 30000 range and this module or whatever happens to live around reserved range of 22000 ish.<p>Then again maybe its crystal clear and if you just translate it into octal, you&#x27;ll see PDP-8 instructions.

I genuinely am sincere here, and I&#x27;m happy to wear my ignorance on my sleeve in the hopes of learning something. I&#x27;m happy to admit that I don&#x27;t have it all figured out!<p>I&#x27;m aware that the USSR didn&#x27;t implement pure Marxism, but implemented something called &quot;communism&quot; and invoked Marx as its deity. I think that a purely classless society as Marx envisioned is probably unachievable. I really am trying to avoid equating support BI with some ridiculous 1950s idea of Soviet communism, and I&#x27;m probably doing a pretty crappy job of it.<p>All that said, the whole concept seems to me to lead down a path that drives entrepreneurs out of the market by making the cost of doing business greater than the profit of it, which would necessarily lead to the nationalization of industries deemed essential. A society in which private entrepreneurs are taxed to a point of zero net revenue is effectively indistinguishable from the state&#x27;s name being on the deed. I recognize that that the concept of that level of taxation is severe, but I&#x27;m also trying to figure out why it wouldn&#x27;t eventually happen.<p>As simply as I can state it, BI seems flawed to me because the cost of living is pegged to the cost of goods, and the cost of goods in a competitive market doesn&#x27;t have a lot of downwards elasticity. The funding for BI would have to come from producers, which would drive up the cost of those goods, which would drive people out of the market, which would reduce competition and increase the cost of goods, all of which increases the minimum BI necessary to achieve a consistent quality of life. That seems to be to be a feedback loop of which the end effect is the effective nationalization of business in order to control prices.<p>Many people obviously disagree that that&#x27;s the end result.

There is no such thing as single Platonic &quot;logic&quot; independent of any qualifier.  There are many different kinds of logic.  There is propositional logic, first order logic, higher order logic(s), modal logics, extensional and intensional logics.  Bayesian reasoning is a (particular kind of) logic.  Specifically, it is a logic of probability, which is to say, the kind of logic that applies when you don&#x27;t know for certain whether something is true of false.  Which is to say, the only kind of logic that actually applies to real-world situations.<p>> A human can decide to stop lying,<p>Can they?  All of them?  Are you sure?  There are humans who can&#x27;t decide to (say) stop smoking, how can you be certain that there aren&#x27;t humans who can&#x27;t decide to stop lying?<p>> a sign can&#x27;t decide to suddenly have predictive scientific properties.<p>Of course a sign can&#x27;t &quot;decide&quot; anything because it doesn&#x27;t have a brain, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it couldn&#x27;t suddenly start to have predictive power.  You can&#x27;t rule out the possibility that the laws of physics could change tomorrow on any <i>logical</i> basis.  The best you can (logically) do is observe that there is a ton of EVIDENCE that thaw laws of physics don&#x27;t change capriciously, and conclude that therefore the probability they will change tomorrow is low (and Bayes&#x27;s theorem will tell you exactly how low if you want to crunch the numbers).<p>Likewise, there is a ton of EVIDENCE to support the theory that the boy in the story is a pathological liar who is not capable of deciding not to lie, or for whatever reason chooses to lie notwithstanding that he might have the ability not to.  The only issue is how many lies it would take before one&#x27;s estimate of the posterior probability of the boy telling the truth was indistinguishable from zero.  This has to do with one&#x27;s Bayesian prior on the probability of a particular random individual being a pathological liar, but that&#x27;s beside the point.  The point is that there is some finite number of lies after which the theory that what the boy says is in any way correlated with the truth (except by chance) is no longer logically tenable.",1378069792

6312156,comment,6309882,6311914,1,0,cheald,,,"> Those who advocate for a BI have nothing against wealth and entrepreneurship, and would probably withdraw their support for it if they believed that it would result in the outcome that you predict. BI isn&#x27;t about everyone being equal, but rather about establishing a minimum income level.<p>I get this; I just wonder about the effect that funding it would have on wealth and entrepreneurship, given that decreasing the value of a unit of work through taxation tends to retard economic growth, and heavy taxation would be necessary to provide for these kinds of programs. If we can manage to pay for them without over-disincentivizing entrepreneurship, everything is dandy. Given the scope of the proposal, that seems sketchy - we have already seen a tangible effect from things like the ACA on employment (that is employers are willing to sacrifice raw economic output in order to avoid higher effective taxes) and that&#x27;s a relatively small drop in the bucket compared to what would be needed to bootstrap a BI system. I may just be mentally overinflating the issue, but it seems like the capital necessary to fund a BI system would be so gargantuan that it would have a significantly detrimental effect on low-margin businesses, kicking us into a feedback look of reduced supply and higher prices.<p>> many wealthy people continue building wealth because it is a side-effect of something that they love to do, not because they want to make even more money.<p>Definitely, and isn&#x27;t that the ideal here? To get us, as a society, to the place where we can devote all our time to things that we love to do, rather than the things that we have to do? I half-joke that I love what I do so much that I&#x27;d do it even if I wasn&#x27;t making money at it, and I think that&#x27;s true for a lot of people, but I can also say that I think the fact of the matter is that most people do what they do because they have to, not because they want to; squeezing out the wealth incentive leaves little there for most. If we can get everyone to a point where people do what they love and society still functions smoothly, I&#x27;ll be the first to sign up for that. :)<p>> What makes you think that we aren&#x27;t already near the price equilibrium that would be reached under a BI system?<p>Back-of-the-napkin math suggests to me that it would require much more capital to implement BI than current entitlement programs require. If this is <i>not</i> the case, and it&#x27;s just a matter of liquidating current entitlement programs, then there&#x27;s absolutely no issue at all. My entire argument is predicated on the assumption that BI would require far more in the way of entitlement resources than we currently have available.",1378069724

It&#x27;s the name of something someone else proposed, while boosting its credibility by invoking Marx.<p>Second of all, nothing approaching Marxism has been tried on a large scale.  Again, see &quot;communism is not marxism&quot;.<p>But more importantly, the essential property of both Marxism and Communism is that the means of production are owned by the state, (&quot;by the people collectively&quot;, ha ha ha).  No BI plan is proposing that.  So they&#x27;re fundamentally absolutely  not marxist, and not communist.<p>I simply don&#x27;t understand what you think the BI plan has in common with Marxism, or with Socialism, aside from a concern for the welfare of poor members of society (a concern which I hope you will agree is not exclusive to Marxism and Socialism).",1378069248

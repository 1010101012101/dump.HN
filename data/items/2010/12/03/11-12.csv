I'm a guy, married and have been hit on in the past (my best defence was to stop working out and put a few pounds on, hasn't been a problem since then although it may have introduced new problems which I'm now working on).<p>It's natural for men and women to flirt, to hit on each other in an attempt to achieve evolution's goal. It's what we're all wired for. However, having said that as long as boundaries are made clear it shouldn't be a problem.<p>I'd also like to say that I have both been 'that guy' and been hit on by 'that woman'. In both cases there are worse things in the world to worry about. In the case of 'that woman' I made a pretty good friend and business associate, in the case of being 'that guy', you chalk it up and move on, or in my case make friends with someone who you wouldn't have perhaps spoken to if you weren't initially attracted to.<p>I'd also second the context. A woman being hit on in SF is nothing like being hit in Cairo, Delhi or even Paris.",1291377544

Nothing is free, its just that costs continually get shifted else where into abstraction. If you pay money to advertise your service then you and (others) are all indirectly paying for your software (and others') so you can be able to offer your software 'free'. If you say, choose to monetize by ads.<p>Really there has not yet emerged an economic model that beats simple old just charge money for it in terms of ease of implementation and use, reliability and path to profitability for someone starting off.<p>Sell Ads, take a minuscule rent to display ads other people bought, micro-payments, licensing, charging for support (urgh!), free (crippled) version to bait to a paid version are actually all more of the same. Except that all but the last requiring a large amount of traction in activity, reputation, users or both. Something very not easy to get, requiring a much longer runway than is feasible for most.unless they wish to seek investment, which is its own can of worms.<p>But I do agree, this direct charging is not going to work much longer than this decade I don't think. It is going to be very interesting to see what sort of new economic models evolve to support consumption and greed. These are interesting times. I hope to be part of it.",1291377417

Although it's frustrating they're not insulting your intelligence, they're probably just as sad as you are that they have to break it down to that level for most people.<p>And, as someone with minor experience on the other side of tech support, you can't really afford to believe someone when they say they know what they're doing, they're quite possibly lying. A great tip my colleague mentioned from his days on tech support: ""Never ask someone to check if it's plugged in. They'll just get offended, assume it's plugged in without checking and tell you it is. Instead tell them that dust gets into the plugs sometimes so take it out, blow on it and put it back in. When they're doing that they discover it wasn't plugged in, and replace it, usually without bothering to tell you why it magically starts working again. Must be that pesky dust!""",1291374500

We try to get people talking first, and make moving to the whiteboard or paper or whatever part of the discussion, rather than propping them up and saying ""Go!"".<p>Additionally, in our line of work sometimes you have to program in a team under extreme time pressures.  We've found that most people who can't talk about programming while sketching ideas and solutions in interview, can't do it for real.<p>The upshot is that you should always be testing for what you actually want.  We want programmers who can design solutions, work in a team, get stuff done, ask questions when unsure, make decisions when necessary, change their mind when appropriate, and write programs that work.

The protection of a logo or name falls under trademark rights.<p>Copyright protects ""original works of authorship including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic and other intellectual works like computer software"" from being reproduced, distributed, and sold(USPTO). But, copyright does not protect game mechanics or rules.<p>A Patent does for a limited time protect a game concept/idea, but Tetris game concept lies in the public domain.<p>So, anyone can legally make and sell a Tetris/Tetromino/falling block game.<p>I am starting a blog series (<a href=""http://desiree47.wordpress.com/2008/11/19/tetris-and-intellectual-property-rights-patent/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://desiree47.wordpress.com/2008/11/19/tetris-and-intelle...</a>) covering IP, the Tetris Company, and iPhone Tetromino games. I have only covered patent law, but the rest is soon to come.",1228640394

Or he may need to maintain and debug it himself, in which case refactoring is hurting the business and possibly introducing new bugs.<p>Those are all perfectly good reasons for development to happen HIS way. I would be really irritated if I hired someone to HELP me they started refactoring stuff instead of following my lead on what are priorities and teaching me in areas where they felt I was weak.<p>It sounds as if the latent issues here are power and compensation. If it is really about design approaches, try to make the system more modular and take care of building one of the modules from scratch yourself. Your employer is more likely to hand down additional responsibility once you've proven your approach in a restricted area.",1228640256
388787,comment,388542,388542,0,0,gaius,,,"Nothing will be done about this because it's very difficult to get men to admit that they're less masculine. It's like the way women are up in arms about unrealistic portrayal in the media, with airbrushing and so on of celebrity photos. Meanwhile you've got Men's Health magazine saying every month ""get a six-pack in 2 weeks or you are a LOSER"" and men just accept it. Feminists have basically hijacked a whole range of issues that actually affect everyone - and created a generation of males without the confidence to address concerns that are far more important than Barbie dolls and other feminist obsessions.",1228640236
388785,comment,387248,387248,0,0,jackdied,,,"As a sometimes Python core developer allow me to say stuff.  The main goal was to remove mistakes; an all-at-once deprecation.  The release was actually much less ambitious than the original name ""Python 3000"" implied.  Guido read one of Joel's posts on rewriting software [the one on the Mozilla rewrite] and dictated that 3.0 be done in a year or two.  See the list of PEPs [Python Enhancement Proposals] for silly big changes that were shot down.<p>As for python 3.0 being 10% slower than 2.5 - that means that it is is just 1.9 times faster than Ruby instead of a clean 2x?  And the backwards incompatible version took just two years instead of infinity like Perl and two years instead of the UNK for Ruby?  Python 2.5 benefited from a corporate sponsored ""Need For Speed"" sprint where twenty of the core devs went on a paid vacation with a mission to just sprint on speed issues.  There hasn't been a corresponding sponsored event for 3.0.<p>A huge amount of volunteer time has been spent on backwards compatibility issues.  When the Python 3.0 issue was first floated the Twisted and Django folks had lots of worries about the transition and supporting two versions (2.x and 3.x).  Hundreds of hours were spent on the email lists and PyCon dinners hashing out the details.  Thousands of hours were spent adding warnings and best practices docs to 2.6 as well as on the ""2to3"" translation tool.<p>Time will tell but there will certainly be lessons learned from the Python 3 release.",1228639881

388774,comment,388097,388495,0,0,davidw,,,"People are still debating the great depression, for that matter, so my expectations are that any debate here will simply go the way of typical libertarians vs the rest discussions that one finds all over the internet, rather than adding anything particularly new or interesting.  There is a lot that we don't know - who knows what sorts of information will come out over the years from people like Paulson, Bernanke, those at the helm at Bear, Lehman, AIG, and so on.  We're still in the middle of this and won't see the end of it for a while, so I really don't think we know enough to draw accurate conclusions.  The fact that it's even a recession was only officially declared last week.<p>That said, I think the problem with the article is one of omission: he points out some regulatory issues, but is blind to the fact that the market screwed up in a lot of ways too:<p>* He barely mentions the ratings agencies, and how badly they got things wrong, the fact that they were being paid by the same people whose risk they had to rate, and some of what has emerged about how they operated.<p>* He seems to gloss over the fact that securitizing mortgages without a requirement for whoever is selling on the mortgage to keep some 'skin in the game' is a recipe for market failure.<p>* He only mentions excessive leverage for Fannie and Freddie.  Not even discussing that for banks is indicative that he's simply out to push his point, rather than take a broad, ideologically neutral look at what went wrong.<p>* He talks about temporary easing of capital requirements.  Libertarians like to point out that once the government gains some power, it's hard to get it back.  I think the reverse is often true as well - 'temporary' measures become permanent due to lobbying and pressure not to let anyone fail.  Perhaps it might have helped, though, but how and when to make those measures go away is a complicated subject in its own right.<p>* In terms of the bailout, it certainly appears that there are lots of dodgy aspects to it, but it's not like you can back up and run these things 10 different ways to see what works best.  I think some of his criticism is sound, but perhaps other approaches would have been worse - it's simply impossible to say.  Doing nothing (the real ""keep the government out of it"" plan) wasn't really an option due to the systemic risk.<p>* I do agree with his hope that we don't overregulate, but don't think we should fight any regulation, just look for sensible things that will 1) continue to allow financial innovation, but 2) patch up some of the problems with this round of things, and attempt to make future bubbles and busts a bit less drastic.  They'll happen just the same, but I view people as basically ""muddling through"" in terms of the economy.  It's too big and complex and vulnerable to new ideas and irrational exuberance to either regulate away all problems (at least without killing off a lot of what's good), and at the same time I don't believe in throwing up our hands in the air and saying ""oh, the free market will take care of everything"" - there are plenty of ways the market can fail, too.",1228639255

388769,comment,388441,388534,0,0,litewulf,,,"That license ""mania"" is important. Just because it restricts you from doing certain things you wish you could doesn't mean the license itself is wrong.<p>RMS once commented that he used OSS not because its better <i>right now</i>, but that by using it (and of course, supporting its development), OSS would be better <i>someday</i>.<p>I guess if you're a startup and trying to be lean and agile and pragmatic, it kind of sucks, but as a human being, who gets to make decisions where one don't need to optimize for ROI, I think its important to recognize what this is: an opportunity. Improve existing tools, maybe help convince Sun to change their license, learn BSD, any of a number of options.<p>This isn't because Linux is a license nazi or anything. GNU (and with it, Linux) exists for a number of reasons, but I think at least some of the people working on it push it because of the way the license operates.<p>In short: feature, not a bug.<p>(PS: this isn't an attack on you; I'm just kind of frustrated that people always have this complaint about ZFS. Sun made ZFS, and open sourced it out of their own good graces. Linus and hundreds and thousands of other people made Linux, and distribute that source out of their own good graces. This isn't a ""well why don't you write a patch"" rant, as much as it is licenses and laws and all that boring stuff exists for a very important reason, and its important to be mindful of the effects it has on you as a human and as a programmer. If you don't like the way it works, please try to participate in the democratic process and make your voice heard through other means as well.)",1228638802

Your argument is based on blaming the poor, over and over again. It must be easy blaming the most vulnerable class.""<p>I'm blaming people that can work, but choose not to due to their free will. Are these people poor?  most likely, yes.  You lump these people in the same group as the people that are physically or mentally unable to work.<p>Quality and quantity are different.  The US may not have the best overall coverage (due to cost), but the quality of our hospitals are the best in the world.  I personally wouldn't want to go anywhere else.<p>I would love to have universal health care, but it's just not a scalable system.  When people know everything is covered, many will go to the doctor or hospital when they don't really need to (hey, I'm paying for it).  This will result in long lines and too few doctors for too many patients.<p>I've seen this at a much smaller scale with a few of my past employers that have ""unlimited technical support"".  Those companies were always over-worked and couldn't afford to hire more staff.  This was because people would call us up for the smallest things.  If they were charged per-hour or per-call,  the business could have scaled much better.  The customers would have also gotten better support because the staff wasn't over-worked.<p>Even though you probably will deny it, this does happen in Canada and many other countries that have government-run healthcare.  All of my relatives live in Canada.  Most come over here for any major surgery because the waiting list is too long.  I know this is just anecdotal evidence, but I've heard this many times before.  I know it's not an isolated incident.<p>If there was a system that limited doctor visits (IE: you get a limited amount per year) and then you were charged money after that.  This would prevent our hospitals and doctors offices from being swamped and possibly allow us to keep some sort of quality.  I know it would never happen, because the government-run healthcare advocates want all or nothing.",1294765112

In the case that they only have a single child, that means the family picks up and moves to the college town of choice. I would be curious to know how these kids fare in the workplace after college.<p>On the other hand, I have seen other families who have treated their children with strictness (where the parents were themselves teachers/professors), have their kids rebel against them in college. Their personalities did a complete 180 as they were suddenly relieved of the harsh treatment, which often landed them into trouble.<p>I am one of those kids who was pushed into piano at age 4. I'm not going to lie - I hated playing for maybe the first 3 or 4 years. My dad would sit with me and force me to practice over and over again. But one day, something clicked, and to this day I have a greater appreciation of music than any of my peers, and I also have a love of music that can only come from myself. I didn't need my dad to force me to practice - I wanted to.<p>I think that my parents eventually switched tactics during my childhood (for better or for worse) after they were convinced that I would choose a path for myself that wasn't detrimental.

GOOL (predecessor to GOAL) was rough around the edges then, but incredibly productive to work in once you got the hang of it -- for all the reasons lisp hackers routinely cite.<p>Then, at ITA, we used Lisp for the QPX airfare pricing system. Both projects used lisp because the early people at both companies came out of the MIT AI Lab: Andy and I at Naughty Dog; Jeremy, Carl, and I at ITA.<p>The issue with lisp -- especially in light of decent alternatives like Ruby and Python -- is that it's hard to find developers. Yes, you can hire from the higher-than-average-talent set of current lispers. But that's a finite and shrinking set. I think that both Andy and Carl  (who wrote the basis of ITA's lisp airfare system) would probably tell the current crop of startup hackers to use a more popular dynamic language. Personally, I'm using Python now, and Peter Norvig's comment about the psuedocode-like nature of Python really resonates with me.<p>But the main reason the popular dynamic languages are winning now, IMO, is all the code you <i>don't</i> have to write. Look at CPAN, PyPi, and whatever the Ruby equivalent is: there are hundreds of really well-written open source modules to do all the things you need to do on a big project. CPAN was first, but Perl poses so many syntactic challenges that it's hard to use it for a big project.<p>In terms of productivity, no language design can compete with not have to write code at all.

Mine is mostly intended to be invoked from Bash the way you'd invoke grep, though it can also be run interactively, where it behaves like irb. The one clever thing I did is allow you to avoid escaping by putting your ruby command after a # on the bash command-line. Bash then ignores everything after the #, and crush (my shell) grabs the last line in the bash history and evaluates the part after the #.<p>I will definitely be trying out your shell.

2092402,comment,2092271,2092271,0,0,gnosis,,,"In the ""redirect harder"" section, the solution given to a program that needs an explicitly named file for standard input is:<p><pre><code>  echo hello | python crap-prog.py /proc/self/fd/0
</code></pre>
In zsh the same thing can be accomplished with a more concise syntax:<p><pre><code>  python crap-prog.py <(echo hello)
</code></pre>
And, if your process wanted to seek the file (which isn't possible to do with a simple redirection of stdin), you could do:<p><pre><code>  python crap-prog.py =(echo hello)
</code></pre>
The main difference is that here, behind the scenes zsh creates and deletes a temporary file with the contents of the stdout of the program between the =().<p>Another neat thing you can do in zsh to solve the original problem is to create a global alias for stdin:<p><pre><code>  alias -g STDIN=/proc/self/fd/0
</code></pre>
Then, whenever you typed ""STDIN"" on the command line, zsh would convert it to ""/proc/self/fd/0"".  Then to make the exact equivalent of the original solution (but one that's easier to remember and type), you could simply write:<p><pre><code>  echo hello | python crap-prog.py STDIN
</code></pre>
A regular alias won't work here, since regular aliases only expand when they're the first part of a command.  Global aliases will expand anywhere in the command line.  So you just have to be a bit more careful with them.<p>---<p>The solution in the ""phantom progress bar"" section is cute, and a good demonstration of what's possible to do with /proc/$PID/fdinfo, but you could just use a ready made solution like either of these:<p><a href=""http://clpbar.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clpbar.sourceforge.net/</a><p><a href=""http://www.ivarch.com/programs/pv.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ivarch.com/programs/pv.shtml</a>",1294763779

Apple had to move quickly by launching the iPhone 4 <i>now</i> and not waiting for summer to launch both versions of iPhone 5, as Android is gaining a lot of steam. This should satisfy impatient buyers who would be very upset if their new purchase would be outdated in just six months. Meanwhile Apple has had no problem refreshing after Christmas (Macworld, new iPad launch impending) because they are obsoleting mostly gifts.<p>Secondly the staggered iPhone 5 launch would provide Apple good negotiation leverage with AT&T without giving a lot up. This could be good for higher monthly kickbacks or iPad data prices. It also lessens the work load on antenna engineers.<p>Given this, it's very likely that the Verizon iPhone 5 will have pent up demand by the September music event, will cause a bigger splash in the media, and have it be the top phone on both carriers in time for Christmas.

2092389,comment,2091366,2091507,0,0,juiceandjuice,,,"Okay, here's the full lowdown on how deaf people communicate.<p>Currently, deaf people log somewhere close to 2 million VRS minutes a month.  These are services where they talk to a VI (video interpreter) to translate sign language as they call somebody else.  This is their native language, and I assure you they prefer it more than any other mode of communication.  Many of them absolutely abhor TTY and often relate text messages with that.  However there are other services which piggy back off of AIM called IPRelay.  This are the only way to communicate on the go, so they are somewhat popular, but nowhere near as popular as VRS.<p>Currently, the only real VRS solutions are point to point from their homes.  Some companies have tried to piggy back off of Facetime with little success, largely due to constraints with the wifi and FCC regulations of logging minutes (that's how they get paid)<p>In the coming months, Sorenson (previously the Sorenson in the Sorenson codec <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorenson_codec"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorenson_codec</a>), the largest provider by far of VRS services (more than a factor of 10) will start to unveil their full onslaught of VRS communications to the deaf community.  Deaf people will be able to use VRS services on Android, iPhone, PCs and Macs.  And not just on wifi, the goal is deployment on 3G and 4G networks, the holy grail, especially because wifi can get really tricky when users are behind firewalls.<p>What does it take for this deployment?  Sorenson has a quality requirement of a minimum of 12 fps and sub 1 second latency over 3G and 4G networks, but a goal closer to 15fps.  They've been able to meet their goals, and their video puts Qik to shame.<p>Sprint is likely going to license Sorenson's technology because they also provide some of their own branded VRS services.<p>So, will the hearing take to video chat?  Maybe, maybe not.  But the deaf will.  For the first time in their life they'll be able to call anyone from anywhere you and I can, and talk to them in their native language, ASL.<p>I probably wouldn't have said any of this a month ago, but Sorenson started  pushing a video teaser for their nTouch brand, which is the brand name for their entire solution (Mobile, PC, and TV based VRS systems)",1294763662

Rather, I think it is a question of what a potential buyer is willing to pay. If a person with a Kindle is looking to read, say, Atlas Shrugged ($19 Kindle, $10 Paperback) I don't think they are going to buy the paperback just to save money. They are probably willing to eat the extra $9 for the immediate gratification. Amazon knows that, so they'll charge more.<p>Also, its interesting to note (from an unscientific random survey) that they are charging less for the Kindle Edition when it comes to bestsellers (which are probably in hardback). I wonder if this is in an effort to hook potential buyers and then increase margins when Kindle owners buy older titles?",1294761898

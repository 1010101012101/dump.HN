And also, you don't have to write all <i>that</i> well to be popular online. Witness the majority of popular blogs.<p>2. I guess I'm arguing for fewer (several) as opposed to hundreds. I just wonder if creating 400 projects is sustainable, as well as whether it's the right mindset to have. But on the other hand, I'm guessing that, as you said, most people will hit their income target long before that, and I'd also guess that most people would naturally optimize this kind of strategy and focus on the most successful projects.<p>3. I'd have liked to see more about this in the article.",1265561928

Pulling more numbers out of thin air, if it takes one day to push out a project making $1/day (a reasonable assumption, I think, once you've already made 100 of them or so), and if the project's useful lifetime is about 1 year, and if you work 200 days a year (so, 200 projects), that gives me $71000/year.  You're not getting rich off this, but you can live comfortably almost anywhere in the world.<p>Of course, the catch is that the projects should require zero maintenance, otherwise it adds up very quickly.",1265561695

1107863,comment,1107828,1107859,0,0,maxklein,,,"1. It's very very difficult to learn to write well or be interesting. I have many friends and I know that no matter how hard they actually tried, they would not be able to write stuff people want to read. They are good at what they do, but they can't write even if they tried.<p>2. Creating one product is the route everyone takes by default. Yes, it works, but this is introducing an alternative route<p>3. Part of the optimisation is focusing on projects that are easy to spin off into new projects. If one project is selling clothes and the next is hospital management software, that's just stupid. If one is an auction management dashboard, the next is a sales management software, then it's easy to adapt. You learn quickly what ideas have generic code bases that are easy to adapt, and what ideas are very specific in their technology and are difficult to adapt.",1265561547

I love innovative and beautiful design as much as anyone, believe me. And yet I am an engineer at heart, and when I see something like this, questions spring to mind, such as ""what is making it move"" and ""how does it control its buoyancy"", amongst others.<p>The greatest triumphs are a meeting of minds between good engineering and beautiful, functional design. This is a lot of the latter  and not a lot of the former. Still, I appreciate the story and hope it inspires those capable of the former to think about how it could be made to work.",1265561521

1107859,comment,1107828,1107828,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"This is an interesting post, and I'm eager to hear what other people who have spent more time in the startup scene think of it. Here's my thoughts:<p>1. I think I've seen the ""two groups"" that the post talks about, but I have begun to have serious doubts that they're as fatalistic as they're made out to be. For example:<p><i>The in-crowd live in the U.S, they attended MIT or Berkeley, they write well, have interesting blogs and are followed by 400 or more people on twitter.</i><p>You can't change where you went to school, but you can improve your writing skills, start a blog, and get 400 followers on Twitter. In fact, this is trivial over a period of months. Writing good content is not only for the elite; it's how you become one of the elite ;)<p>2. If you do a little research up front on the market for whatever you're going to create, you might be able to just create one product rather than 400. It might be more difficult in the beginning, but you just might learn an incredible amount and turn out to be one of the most well-rounded sources of startup insight on HN. See patio11 / Bingo Card Creator for an example :)<p>3. My main concern would be sustainability; those 150 projects that make you $12k / month aren't going to do so forever. You'll run yourself ragged trying to keep them all together, and at some point, you'd probably be better off with a job. I guess what I'm saying is to try and pick a model that will scale more than $1/day projects will.<p>In spite of these criticisms, I did enjoy this article for its thought-provoking angle that's very different from a lot of the stuff I read on HN.",1265561224

1107854,comment,1107078,1107633,0,0,calbers,,,"As the author of the article on SISC, I looked int ASE.  The emphasis, as far as I can see, on the ASE is on 'scripting', running scripts to access certain parts of the android os. Which parts of the OS depends on the interfaces the ASE projects implements for the respective scripting languages to connect to.  So far, I don't think the ASE project is focusing too much on the interactive elements (in android speak, 'Activities') of Android, those elements that users/developers think of as part of the 'app'.  So, at the moment, ASE isn't really about building apps, but allowing scripting functionality to apps.  Using JRuby or in this case SISC Scheme outside of the ASE environment could lead to full Android apps.  (Hopefully)",1265561104

For every Facebook group spewing some idiotic nazi crap there are three condemning it.  If you let anyone stand on their little soapbox and say anything, then sure - people already inclined to thinking that way will stay and listen but everyone else will walk by.  If, however, it's the only person speaking and you're forced to hear it, then that's different.<p>In Rwanda there was essentially one radio station, completely controlled by the genocidares, spewing the sort of hate mongering that makes Sean Hannity look like Sesame Street.  It helped them fan the flames and importantly, it helped them coordinate efficiently.  It's not necessarily why there was a genocide there, but it's largely why it was so completely effective.<p>It's also worth noting that this was 15 years ago - Rwanda is an amazing place to visit now.

Women are still saddled with the primary responsibility of (bearing and) raising kids.  My ex was career military.  Prime soldiering years are age 18 to 40.  That also happens to be prime childbearing and childrearing years for a woman.  So women are unlikely to ever compete equally with men for military careers.  Although I don't have much hard data, it seems to me that founding a large company (the type that seeks VC) is probably also mostly a young person's game.

46682,comment,46540,46540,0,0,portLAN,,,"Great chutzpah setting the record straight in front of everyone.  Note for presenters: Have a contingency plan if your demo breaks that involves something other than insulting a guy who's doing you a favor.  Good restraint saying ""I wasn't seeing any video"" rather than ""their demo was unrehearsed and the product didn't work"".<p>Cambridge sounds even worse than I thought.  YC should do everything in SV and just have a trip out to Boston for demo day -- although from the sound of it there's not much point, if the Boston investors are such that the East Coast bunch has to move to SV for funding anyway.  Good for warmups for the SV investors, though.<p>If you want to give your start-up the best shot, why spend all that time in the distant-second place (Boston is #2) when you could be in #1?

As a researcher strokes the real hand and the rubber hand simultaneously with a stick, people have the vivid sense that the rubber hand is their own.<p>> When the rubber hand is whacked with a hammer, people wince and sometimes cry out.</i><p>That's not an out-of-body experience.  That's called ""oh shit I can't see my hand and he's about to smash it with a hammer!""

46679,comment,46324,46377,0,0,garbowza,,,"Large companies have built in processes for security, which slows down their software development, but also ensures better security than someone hacking together a site from scratch as quickly as possible. <p>Most of us hackers are jack of all trades, focusing on web design, databases, business logic, and security. It is difficult to be an expert in all areas while simultaneously focusing on speed of release. Just because a company has security experts doesn't guarantee secure software (Microsoft), but in many cases it does help.",1188102188
46678,comment,46614,46614,0,0,henning,,,"""the defining moment of the Web 2.0 revolution was Google's invention of PageRank""<p>Huh? PageRank dates from the late 90s. And it's implemented in a compiled language (C++, I think -- not even GC'd).<p>And it involves elementary linear algebra. Heresy!<p>Now, as for the book itself. It looks like it tries to cover waaay too much -- support vector machines and other forms of supervised learning, unsupervised learning/clustering, optimization and evolutionary computation, applications to collaborative filtering, along with using particular libraries. There's no way you could cover all that in 358 pages!<p>I gave a talk on evolutionary computation to a Ruby users group and their jaws literally dropped. Web people don't give a shit about something if it doesn't involve HTTP, a programming language that's currently en vogue, JavaScript, or relational databases (really only MySQL or maybe Postgres).<p>If you're interested in an introductory data mining book with a practical focus, may I instead suggest Witten and Frank's ""Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques""? It uses Weka throughout, which is mature and nice.",1188102047

3895273,comment,3894302,3894714,4,0,Symmetry,,,"It would be more fair to say that economics assumes that people try to achieve their goals in rational ways.  Which is actually a fairly good assumption in most cases when people can work in large groups, face the same challenges again and again, and can watch each other succeed or fail.  There's really no assumption that people are equally informed, because when I read economists talking about things they always seem to spend at least a quarter of their time talking about signalling.<p>Sometimes the assumption that people are rational breaks down, like with sticky prices caused by what psychologists would call ""loss aversion"".  In that case economists make the changes they need to to their models to account for how people differ from the simplest model.  This is basically how you get the entire field of Macroeconomics.",1335463192

The trick is (with abs plastic) to increase the platform temp to 120 C.<p>I sincerely hope nobody buys the $499 version because it is just impossible to print without a heated platform. The plastic slides around everywhere. Spend the extra $100 for the heated platform + case.<p>I really want to get one of these so I can print more than 1 thing at a time 0_o<p>Seems like it will be very similar to the Makerbot Replicator ($1,750), but with less support (both of the software + hardware).<p>For example, my build platform was slightly warped (probably the case for 50% of buyers), and upon emailing support they promptly put me on a list for a new (gratis) platform to be shipped out next week. Not sure if this will be the case for Solidoodle- my guess is no.<p>My recommendation - wait for a printer that can clear its own build platform. It takes 1-10 hours to print out an object, even with 1% infill. Just heating the machine takes 10-15 minutes from room temp.<p>I built an enclosure for my replicator and it has helped tremendously - both in keeping the cats out and in keeping the heat in.<p>I have a computer set up with a webcam so I can watch/start the printer from afar- but without a self-clearing mechanism, it's impossible to administer from afar and very difficult to print out many items one after the other (platform cools much faster than it heats, so if you are able to start the next print right away it would significantly reduce print time).<p>Also, something should be done about the build platform - it warps easily and loses its stickiness (requiring you to replace the klapton tape every 20-30 prints).<p>If you've got some free time and an eagerness for tinkering, go for it. Don't expect it to print effortlessly, without intervention, or in fine detail.",1335463085

3895260,comment,3894302,3895244,5,0,tptacek,,,"How can a market maker be the fastest <i>without</i> providing liquidity? An HFT market maker's willingness to buy XYZ from Alice at $10/shr to allow her out of her XYZ position is practically the definition of liquidity; its willingness to turn around and sell XYZ at $10.05/shr to Bob is more liquidity still. Alice wants to sell and can do so immediately and at a price she accepts; Bob wants to buy and can do so immediately at a price he accepts. That's liquidity.<p>The markets do not do that automatically. Before automated trading, Alice could sell, but would probably have had to do so at significantly less than $10/shr, even if the market was indicating $10 was the true price of XYZ. Bob could buy, but would probably have to do so at significantly more than $10.05/shr.

I have set my OSX dock to autohide at the bottom, and I'm glad I don't have to move across to reach it. Flick down, boom, Dock. It works even better than it sounds since it works along the edge, not solely where the dock is. Even with multiple monitors, my dock is at most one screen-wide away (even in a triple head setup), while a left-bound dock is two (even three) screenful away.<p>Also, I seem to unconsciously end up with the pointer in a vertically centered zone. Horizontally it comparatively could stay in any place, left, center or right. Statistically that might be the case too since going up for a (application or status icon) menu will later have me bring the pointer down since I click on a menu entry.<p>What's more it seems more natural and producing less strain for my eyes to peek up or down than to the far left. Indeed when I want for something to 'disappear' (like the pointer when typing) I move it sideways, never up or down.<p>Hence since I'm at most a screen width and half a screen height away form the dock, 'flick, boom, Dock' works only at the bottom.<p>While all of this may apply only to me (and I used a left-bound dock for a while myself, but ended up reverting back to the bottom edge) I understand that some may have other habits and prefer a left-, or right-bound dock. This is why both Gnome 3 and Unity drive me insane, because even if I had a lengthy experiment with a side dock it just doesn't make sense to me, and this is really infuriating to not let people have their way in this case.<p>(besides, vaguely related to the subject and multi head setups notwithstanding, I find it infuriating in Gnome 3 that the left edge does not reveal the dock and the right edge the workspace switcher. the whole thing just <i>begs</i> for it)",1335461733

I'm going to rely on an example I used before[1]. Let's assume that if you're on this site, you probably build some kind of web technology. Were you aware that a portion of your users are colorblind? Did you just do a mental double-check and go ""shoot, I should check up on that?""<p>You didn't actively do anything against colorblind people, it simply <i>wasn't on your radar</i>. You can go through your entire site design, do A/B testing, deploy, get good results, and still be completely unaware of this. When someone comes up to you and says ""I'm colorblind, you should add 'OK' to this green button because it's hard for me to use your site without that,"" what do you do?<p>""Sorry! I didn't intentionally mean to make it hard for you to use! I deeply regret that you can't use the site.""<p>or how about<p>""Hey! Chill out! We were just trying to make a good site and the numbers say we're ok!""<p>Both of those answers sound pretty awful and insensitive. And yet, these are the responses to your ""two ways"" listed above. Probably the correct answer is ""Oh wow, we weren't aware that was a problem. We're going to go fix it, can you tell us specifically what is wrong?""<p>Which is exactly the kind of response we need to sexism in technology. It boils down to being aware of how your actions make other people feel, and when an issue is brought up you consider it earnestly. When you figure that out, <i>and learn to handle when you haven't</i>, you can stop ""being afraid of accidentally offending someone"" (itself casual sexism) and you can actually work to make things inclusive.<p>One great read on this is Ellen Spertus' MIT AI Lab Technical Report[2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3772919"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3772919</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://people.mills.edu/spertus/Gender/pap/pap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.mills.edu/spertus/Gender/pap/pap.html</a>",1335460849

See? No need for an HSS parser. That's really what ""reinventing the wheel"" warns against.<p>Note: I'm generally in favor of rewriting things, when the benefits are clear. With HSS, I don't see why I'd want to replicate the tree again,(using a different syntax, i won't even be able to copy-paste!) just for the style. I'd rather use XPath selectors and XML.<p>Some thoughts:<p>1. It would be nice to merge CSS with XML (as others have said - there is really no need to have 2 different syntaxes)<p>2. It would be nice to use XML everywhere (the more you use it, the easier it's going to be to integrate this into IDEs, scripts, web apps, etc).<p>3. The important thing is the value of the COLOR, not the fact that you managed to parse braces, pipes, etc and come up with your own syntax for representing a tree and selecting elements in it? That's wasted effort and you're not innovating. Use XML, or JSON, or YAML (whatever floats your boat), but use that EVERYWHERE: for data and style. That would be a step forward from HTML/CSS.<p>4. Again, there is no need to reinvent XPath, like CSS selectors are trying to do. Use XPath, it works great with XML, it's CONCISE and it is familiar and simple, because it looks like a file path (or basic url) with some optional filtering on each level. (N.B.: don't fall in the XPath2/XQuery trap).<p>5. Embedding Javascript would be easy: it would be the same as HTML: <script/>.<p>6. You get brownie points if you could use JSON for elements, style and scripts. You'd reduce the entire HTML/CSS/JS stack to just JSON:<p><pre><code>  //index.json
  {
    books: [ { title:""foo"" }, { title:""bar"" } ]
  }

  //index.axr (keep XPath-like syntax for selectors, use HSS-like syntax for style)
  {
     select:""books[0]/title"",
     style: {
              color:""#ff0"",
              background: { ... }
            }
  }

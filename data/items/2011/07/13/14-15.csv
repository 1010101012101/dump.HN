Oh, I get it now! Microsoft hasn't let go of a unified OS running on desktops, tablets, consoles, and cell phones.

That means if anyone attacks that one product credibly, the whole company is rocked hard. Better to be diversified, broadly speaking. (Details matter, of course.)<p>What are the odds Google, Amazon, and a not insignificant number of the other backup vendors in the world are planning some form of direct competition?<p>... actually, this speaks to what sort of concerns me about a bubble right now. Excessive valuations aren't themselves a cause, they have to be a symptom of something else. ISTM there is an excessive optimism over any one company's ability to completely lock up the market forever and ever, amen. To be honest I don't expect one masterstroke that comes in and just destroys Dropbox in three days, but valuating them as if it's just an assured thing that they're going to completely own the home backup market over the next ten years is absurdly optimistic. It's one possible outcome, but not anywhere near the most likely. Valuating Facebook as if it's going to own social networking forever and ever is absurd; look at the very rapid inroads G+ is making, my point being that even if G+ crashes and burns it has clearly demonstrated that it has a chance, and that means other competition has a chance, too. Valuating X as if it's going to own the market is stupid, and a lot of the valuations seem to be based on that; not a reasonable, rational assessment of the possibility that they may own the market or at least do well, but valuations based on the solid, near-100% of that outcome.

Back in the early 00's, I was working at a large university, and thanks to VMWare's $49 academic/hobby Workstation license, I got my entire department onto it (we all used Linux on the desktop), and I bought myself a personal home license.  This was the v1.x days.<p>I forget if it was the 2.x -> 3.x or 3.x -> 4.x upgrade, but they eventually dropped the hobby/academic cheap licensing and the price jumped to something like $150 per seat.  I remember calling our sales contact and complaining about how much the jump sucked, and when they wouldn't budge, I essentially told no thanks and that I'd wait for the open source options to mature.  He, of course, chuckled at this quaint notion.<p>A few years later I had to chuckle back when they started giving away the basic versions of VMWare, since open source options and Microsoft were by then eating their lunch on the desktop.<p>Funny how history repeats itself.  I hope VMWare lives to regret this latest trend in greed of theirs.<p>P.S.  -- I also had a similar exchange with the Accelerated X folks, back when xfree86 didn't do multi-head very well (or at all).

Are great companies the same thing as great games? No doubt, great companies can make great games, but ""great companies"" can mean a lot of things. If you're talking from a business perspective, you might be talking about strong profits and a good pipeline. EA is living proof that you can build a ""great company"" where product innovation takes a back seat to a ""re-hash and re-release"" product cycle.<p>Plenty of companies found a way to build great games on the Nintendo platform. Particularly in the early days when the NES reigned supreme. Some of the best games ever made were built for that platform. The question of whether the companies that made them were ""great"" is irrelevant.<p>Fast forward to today, and I'd say we're about to come full circle. Yes, it is more difficult to gain access to a gaming platform like the XBox, Wii, or PS3, but they are huge markets with huge incentives. The Wii brought a whole new round of innovative game play concepts, and the Kinect is doing the same on the XBox platform.<p>In the end, whether or not console stifle innovation may not matter all that much. The internet and mobile devices are the new floppy. Anyone can build a game for Android. Developing for iOS costs you $99/year; hardly a high threshold. There are already billion dollar gaming industries built atop Flash-based gaming. As WebGL progresses, we'll see a whole new round of creativity well up.",1310567633

Developers do what Deep Throat suggests: they follow the money.<p>People often complain about the unpredictability and capriciousness of Apple's App Store policies yet it's still where developers flock to. Why? Because they make money. Those same policies arguably hurt developers but they definitely help the consumer, which ultimately does help the developer. Tae that as an example of developers not knowing what's good for them.<p>You see the same thing particularly in tech journalism: people often say the problem with, for example, Windows Phone 7 or WebOS is a lack of developers. No. The problem is a lack of users (and thus money to be made). Developers follow the money.<p>In the case of Twitter, I think it's downfall is that it is simply a very marginal product and has missed its opportunity to change that. Its usage is a lot lower than the number of accounts suggests [1]. I believe it was envisioned as a way of people sharing status updates in a more public fashion than Facebook. The reality of Twitter (IMHO) is that it's a way of following celebrities.<p>Twitter clients were doomed before they started, doomed to commoditization then cannibilzation that is. It was naive to go into building on someone else's platform any other way (yet many did seem to believe that Twitter was somehow ""different"").<p>I don't believe the existence of these apps is the reason for Twitter's success either. My personal opinion is that people decide to use Twitter and then look for an app to do it. Twitter lives and dies by the success of...

Or, you can find a template (plenty online) which you can modify.<p>Finally - if you want to do something like emailing people etc. - it involves learning a bit about how web hosting works.

I worked on a project in a Wi-Fi environment in a warehouse and the network admins of the company pored over sniffer logs in great detail. Excessive ARP probes and non-standard DHCP behavior was especially frowned upon. I'm pretty sure the early ARP requests would have caught their attention.<p>It gets really problematic if you have several APs servicing one network. What to do if the client roams from one AP to another AP with the same ESSID? Assume it's the same network, in which case you can keep your IP or do you have to redo your ARP or the whole DHCP thing? In our case the client wanted to suppress everything including the ARP but in a general case that's probably not good, especially if the network is called 'linksys'.<p>Might be interesting to try with a Mac.",1310566722

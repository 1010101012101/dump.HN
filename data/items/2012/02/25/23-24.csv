That really makes me feel better and provides somewhat more insight into the process.<p>My 5 years of experience was actually divided like 3 between Masters and Bachelors and 2 after Masters here in US, so I thought my Masters grade would matter.<p>My interviews were 3 before lunch and 2 after. Lunch was good :).<p>The interview conductor asked for references multiple times, but although I knew some people working in Google, but they had never closely worked with me, so I didn't want to make up references just for the sake of it.<p>EDIT:\n""As far as releasing interview scores goes, that isn't going to happen for good reason. A score, by itself, is meaningless. Interviewers are calibrated against other interviews they've done and other interviewers. This is all in an attempt to make a fair assessment of the candidate. If a particular interviewer gives high marks to candidates where all the other interviewers don't, that gets calibrated. And vice versa.""<p>So what you are saying is that for me to not have made it through I must have equally messed all my interviews or at least a majority of them. I surely didn't feel like that after the interview, but who knows, since I still don't have a way to know if that is the case. Then this really sucks.",1330214295

It can be a frustrating and even exhausting experience so I certainly understand why you're bummed it didn't work out (I was the first time) but let me clear up a few things.<p>You don't need to go to an Ivy League or otherwise top school (actually most of the Ivies aren't in the top CS schools). I certainly didn't. I didn't even go to school in the US.<p>As far as grades go, if you're going in with 5 years of post-school experience, your grades probably won't even enter into the picture.<p>As far as releasing interview scores goes, that isn't going to happen for good reason. A score, by itself, is meaningless. Interviewers are calibrated against other interviews they've done and other interviewers. This is all in an attempt to make a fair assessment of the candidate. If a particular interviewer gives high marks to candidates where all the other interviewers don't, that gets calibrated. And vice versa.<p>I would suggest that anyone who wants to apply have someone within the company refer you. For one thing they'll be able to guide you through the process better and (hopefully) set your expectations correctly.<p>Plus a strong internal reference will help you much more than acing an interview question.<p>Starting with a basic solution won't hurt you either. You're right that staring at the whiteboard blankly for half an hour is the wrong thing to do. More than the code itself, the interviewer is interested in how you think and how you apply your knowledge to find a solution more than the solution itself. A suboptimal solution that works trumps no solution or even a more optimized solution with serious problems. It's totally fine to start with something that works and then refine.<p>One question though: did you have five interviews onsite one after the other or was one of them a lunch (or was a lunch in between any of them)?<p>Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or simply want to pass along any feedback.<p>EDIT: to clarify the calibration comment, imagine interviewers give a grade to the interviewee. If a given interviewer gives nothing but A+s then an A+ means less from that interviewer. Likewise, all Cs makes another C not necessarily a problem. That's why I say individual feedback scores only mean something in context.<p>Also, what an interviewer writes about you means WAY more than any given score. An A+ with no justification is simply ignored. A C- with no justification is likewise ignored.<p>Luck can unfortunately enter the process in a way different to what you might expect. If we're hiring a lot of people then at that time it can be easier to get a ""yes"". If headcount is tight, it becomes correspondingly harder to get a ""yes"".<p>Lastly, there are two different answers wrapped up into ""no"" that you unfortunately can't distinguish between from the feedback you're given.<p>The first is a definite ""no"" in that we're sure that at least for now we don't want to extend an offer. You may simply not be ready. There can be lots of reasons. We may well re-interview such people a year or more down the track. A very few are definite ""no""s (eg they became belligerent or wildly inappropriate--yes it sometimes happens).<p>The second type of ""no"" is simply ""we're not absolutely sure it's a yes"". I must've fallen into this category because I was contacted two months later. You may well be in this category. Unfortunately there's no way to know. But we do keep records of those that applied and constantly go back through them.<p>As far as acing all the interviews goes, no you don't need to but you probably need to do really well on at least well (and can probably bomb one). Of course all of this depends on the position, current hiring needs, the particular hiring committee you go through and a host of other factors.<p>Don't forget you're not being judged in isolation either. There may simply be a strong pool of other candidates at the time you applied.",1330213632

3634224,comment,3633985,3633985,2,0,newbusox,,,"This article seems to imply that you can never change people's behavior by law (i.e. like posting a sign on a door saying not to throw towels on the floor) because people will always do whatever they want. I don't think I agree with that--I think the quesiton is to what extent are entities willing to impose penalties and enforce the law to sufficiently change people's behavior. For example, obviously if the company in the hypothetical hired a guy to sit in the bathroom to make sure that people threw paper towels in the trash can and then fired people who disobeyed, far fewer people who throw paper towels on the floor.<p>So, the issue as related to piracy is not necessary that people would never change their behavior, its just that the cost of monitoring behavior and enforcing currently existing law/creating new law to effect such a behavioral change (""don't pirate stuff"") is extraordinarily high. Right now, the strategy of the media industry appears to be to spend money under the presumption that the amount of money they spend enforcing/lobbying/trying to pass laws to prevent piracy makes economic sense: they will gain/save more money than they spend. This seems unlikely, but probably people have punched the numbers for these companies and concluded that this is the case. The radical alternative approach is to completely rethink the distribution and pricing scheme, and focus less on margins but more on quantity--distribute the content to as many people as possible, but make fewer $/product. To impose that would require either some fairly revolutionary thinking in companies that have repeatedly shown a hesitancy to innovate (and would require them to abandon a strategy now that still makes hefty profits), or to make media companies hurt to such an extent that they have no alternative (which, right now, does not appear to be happening).",1330213281

He wasn't taken to a station, booked, processed, read his rights, or informed ""you're under arrest"". Also, in the state of New York, open container is a misdemeanor; in many (maybe most?) states, you can't be ""arrested"" for a misdemeanor without an outstanding arrest warrant.<p>Arrest is very bad. It creates a record, it allows the officer to search (thoroughly) your person and immediate presence, and in major metro areas will probably incur the very unpleasant process of being booked (in many cities, this may involve a strip search). <i>Don't get arrested</i>.<p>Detention is what happens when you're not free to leave but aren't being arrested. You can be cuffed during a detention. Very little cause is required to detain. Detention does not create a record, and (very importantly) does not allow the detaining officer to do much more than frisk for weapons.<p>In either case, laughing at police officers, while legal, is dumb. Picking a fight with them (""you're giving a bad image of America!"") is even dumber. Stanford Prison Experiment aside, whatever the power dynamics may be, you are unlikely to be able to fathom the bullshit city police have to deal with on a daily basis during their shifts. You simply aren't going to be able to take the high ground from them; they don't care. The very fact that you'd consider needling a cop about their behavior is a spectacular luxury, and while I support vigorously everyone's right to avail themselves of that luxury, I'm not particularly impressed by people abusing it.<p>Finally, a summons for open container is in all likelihood not something that would have any impact on one's immigration status (you can Google this question to see immigration lawyers answering it). ""Court summons"" sounds scary, but it is exactly the same language used when you get a traffic ticket. Cops: not immigration officials.

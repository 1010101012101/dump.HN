8628802,comment,8628670,8628670,0,0,higherpurpose,,,"> This is just plain wrong. I&#x27;m questioning that, because WhatsApp has to add a back-door for sure. And Doctorow knows that. This is because of Section 215 US Patriot Act – at least there is a legal back door, which can be (ab)used by US governmental agencies at any time.<p>Care to elaborate on that? Because I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any law right now, not even CALEA, that <i>demands</i> a backdoor in a chat application. That&#x27;s not to say Whatasapp won&#x27;t <i>willingly</i> add such a backdoor, but I don&#x27;t think anything legal forces them to do it. FBI has been lobbying for the past few years to pass such as a law, though, which is for now unsuccessful, fortunately.<p>I&#x27;d say wait a year or so after Whatsapp enables this and for iOS, too. If we won&#x27;t hear anything from the US, Saudi, Indian or Chinese governments about how angry they are at Whatsapp&#x27;s new encryption, then we should start to become very suspicious about that encryption. Because this should make them <i>at least</i> as angry as full disk encryption made FBI. Heck, the Saudi gov was even pissed off at Whatsapp&#x27;s HTTPS encryption.",1416383990

You may claim that I&#x27;m blaming the victim, but from what I&#x27;ve observed many cyclists kind of enjoy a little (in their opinion) justified indignation at the behavior of car drivers. And they&#x27;ll intentionally put themselves in positions to feel that justified rage.<p>How many times have you seen a cyclist in the right-hand bike lane try to overtake a car signaling for a right turn while both are approaching an intersection, rather than yielding to the car who will clearly reach the intersection first? And then the cyclist acts surprised and offended when the driver begins to turn into them.<p>Of course this is a recipe for disaster, and I see it multiple times per week from my position a safe distance back from the turning car, which I can observe and then safely pass on the left.<p>You don&#x27;t have to be a rocket scientist to be safe on a bike.

Evernote&#x27;s greatest strength is its flexibility.  It works on basically every platform and integrates with most other tools you use.  It doesn&#x27;t really tell you <i>how</i> to use it though, which is where GTD fits in perfectly.  (And it turns out to be really helpful to integrate as much of your system as possible into one tool.)<p>I found this site to be a great resource getting started with GTD and Evernote: <a href=""http://www.thesecretweapon.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thesecretweapon.org/</a><p>My current system is very similar to what they describe, although I added a &#x27;Waiting&#x27; status, which includes both things that need to be done at or after a given time, and things where I want to remember that I&#x27;m waiting on something outside my control (a reply to an email, for instance).  I set reminders on everything in there.<p>The one other significant tweak I made is to use notebooks instead of tags for the &#x27;when&#x27; portion.  Since every task needs to have a &#x27;when&#x27;, and since every note has one and only one notebook, this seemed like a logical fit.  So instead of the &#x27;Current&#x27; notebook they recommend, I simply use a Current stack containing a notebook for each priority level.<p>I also use Powerbot to improve clipping emails from gmail.<p>Anyway, the details don&#x27;t matter and are easy to change.

8628772,comment,8628402,8628663,0,0,CaptainZapp,,,"Thanks for asking.<p>I basically refer to your comments in which you quite vehemently defend the companies extremely shady tactics. As for mob behavior, which apparently disturbs you so much. This may, or may not be true. personally, I don&#x27;t buy it.<p>Let&#x27;s look at your original comment to which I replied and let&#x27;s try to rephrase the points you make.<p><pre><code>  1) Stuff about the CEO&#x27;s personal life.
</code></pre>
Misogynistic comments (Boob-er) to a magazine has nothing whatsoever to do with the CEOs private life. The statements where not made at a private function, but to a mass market publication.<p><pre><code>  2) CEO wants to automate business processes. Those of us in tech would never consider replacing humans with machines, right?
</code></pre>
The point here is not that the CEO wants to automate business processes, but the disdain and disregard that he shows for his employees. Your phrasing of this point is, at best, highly disingenuous.<p><pre><code>  3) Trying to compete for workers. (Didn&#x27;t we hate Apple/Google for agreeing not to do this?)
</code></pre>
The point, as you are probably very well aware, is not competing for workers, but the <i>methods</i> used to do that. The tech company violation of anti trust laws, while also unethical, has pretty much nothing to do with Ubers shady tactics in this context.<p><pre><code>  5-7) A few Uber drivers are crazy (Uber is helping the cops). Note that if most of these incidents happened in a taxi, the cops would have little info unless the passenger remembered a license #.
</code></pre>
Uber helps the cops? I&#x27;m sure they do if the cops have a warrant, since, in this case, there&#x27;s not much choice anyway. for the rest we only have the word of Ubers PR Departments word on this Interestingly that&#x27;s always the same standard broken record: &quot;We&#x27;re looking into it, actively support the investigation and we have deactivated the partner from the Uber platform&quot;<p>The problem is that in my opinion they come over as a bunch of liars in their PR, even in the not very trustworthy field of public relations.<p>Hiring drivers, whom&#x27;s background check must have failed, if done seriously, or smearing the victims of those incidents (again, in a partially very misogynist fashion) doesn&#x27;t help much either.<p><pre><code>  8) Standard french advertising in France.
</code></pre>
I get it you where never in France. Hiring hookers as driver is not a French standard advertising practice.<p><pre><code>  9) Standard PR.
</code></pre>
maybe, but again with extremely shady tactics applied (and not very well executed, either)<p><pre><code>  10) Exec discusses hiring journalists to do journalism to journalists. You know, digging up stuff about their personal life, kind of like (1) on this list.
</code></pre>
Sounds more like a Scientology black ops towards critics, than a standard journalistic tactic. What you glossed over is their abuse of private data if it suits their interest. Which, again in my opinion, is actually worse than the idea to smear a journalist and go after her family.<p>Put this reply of yours together with your comment history and applying Occam&#x27;s razor you come over as an Uber shill and not as a person who hates mob mentality and has too much time on his had.<p>But that&#x27;s just my opinion.",1416383336

In fact I like this parallelism model, but I was specifically talking about parallelism built into the language (Threads, Actors, Tasks).<p>This is a long and complicated answer. I doubt I&#x27;ll do it justice in a few paragraphs, but I&#x27;ll try.<p>In one word: simplicity. Primarily, not having parallelism is far simpler than having it. Yes, some models of parallelism are simpler than others but at the end of the day I think we can all agree none of these models are as simple as not having parallelism. As per &quot;net negative&quot;: yes, ofcourse, not having parallelism is a &quot;negative&quot;. However, &quot;net negative&quot; is interestingly more linked to the applied domain rather than the actual concept. Simply put, the domains that JavaScript is used in don&#x27;t heavily rely on parallelism (or rather, require the optimization of parallelism).<p>Thinking about this now, its sort of similar in nature to why people like garbage collection. There is an inherent negative to using a garbage collector, however, (I think we can both agree) in certain (most) domains it turns out to be a net positive. Why? For the same reason, simplicity.<p>I mean, I could go on, but I&#x27;m trying to be as concise as possible. Hopefully, that was a useful.

You can write Javascript by hand which would be good strongly typed code, even if there is no compiler or runtime checks to enforce this. OCaml has js_of_ocaml, which can turn 99% of valid OCaml code into Javascript. And OCaml&#x27;s type system is a hell of a lot more strict than Java&#x27;s.

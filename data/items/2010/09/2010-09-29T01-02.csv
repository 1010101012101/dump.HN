1738059,comment,1736675,1737194,0,0,alextp,,,"I think most of this is due to the fact that most ML techniques need lots of specific knowledge to apply correctly. Many introductions focus too much on specific algorithms, for example, while ensemble methods are probably best in real-world data. The pactices of building training and test sets, of regularizing, of doing proper feature engineering, and of making structured models (for example) are more easily learned in a mentor-student relationship than by reading blogs (reading papers might take you a long way, but you won't build an intuition as to why things work and why they fail without lots of experimentation or advice from someone who already has this intuition) and/or AI books, and ML books are usually far too technical (or too superficial in the technical side, as is programming collective intelligence).",1285725568

1738045,comment,1737867,1737867,0,0,chrisgoodrich,,,"I think that many people that post about AB tests fail to mention that one's expectations of AB testing have to align with the types of results one can get from AB testing.<p>AB testing isn't meant to used through the entire conversion funnel.  That is, you can't measure an optimization on your homepage by sales.  Sales is an indication of your entire conversion funnel.  Each page of every site should have a single goal and you should AB test to that goal.  In your case I would say that you're AB test was successful; however, you didn't go far enough.  Once you were getting increased traffic to your signup page, it's time to AB test the signup page and improve that conversion.<p>The statistics behind AB testing are often lost by the hype.  The tests used to calculated statistical significance require a random sampling and isolated variables.  The moment you try to attribute success or failure of your AB test beyond the primary measurable goal, you're introducing outside variables that will skew your results.<p>All of that being said, I would argue that true AB testing is not cost effective for most startups.  It takes a lot of timer and energy to test every part of your conversion funnel.",1285725191

The truth of the matter is that the UI experience for computers is largely defined by what happens on the screen - be it laptop, iPad or iPhone. There's this cool scene in Gary Hustwit's Objectified where Bill Moggridge talks about designing one of the very first laptops, and the conclusion he comes to is that it didn't matter how usable or how good his physical design was, in the end the user's experience of the laptop came largely from within the screen.<p>That surprised him, and got him thinking about what we now know as 'interaction design'. (Incidentally, Moggridge coined the term shortly after his experience with the laptop).<p>He describes his experience as: 'being sucked into the screen.' Which is true, if you pause to think about it: the design of the laptop only matters when you're carrying it around with you - when you're working on it the screen overrides almost everything else.",1285725072

1737952,comment,1736055,1736594,0,0,blahblahblah,,,"To further confuse non-painters, although painting is done with a subtractive color system and, technically, cyan, magenta, and yellow are the primaries of such a system, painters don't actually mix their colors from a palette of cyan, magenta, and yellow.  If you ask a painter what the primary colors are, they will tell you yellow, red, and blue.  A typically painter's palette will consist of a couple hues of each of the primaries + titanium white (except in watercolor, where the natural white of the paper is typically retained instead of using a white pigment).  For example, you might use cadmium yellow light, yellow ochre, cadmium red medium, alizarin crimson, cerulean blue, and phthalo blue for your palette.  Mixing from a limited palette such as this helps to give the painting a color scheme that is harmonious (and is worthwhile practice if you're a designer who wants to really develop a good feel for color harmony in your designs).  A common mistake beginners make is to load up their palette with every tube color they can find at the local art supply store.  The end result is a painting with colors that clash like a bad 1970's leisure suit and/or ugly dull muddy color that doesn't pop at all.",1285722510

On social sites, I find myself often finding value in overlooked comments or articles and, worse yet, often finding little value in the most popular comments and articles.<p>On technical sites, popularity again has little to do with helpfulness, although this has become probably the single greatest ranking metric in search results.

Even if one of the Safari versions tagged in that repository happens to be the exact source that ships in some iOS 4.x, Apple has to make that relationship clear because (AFAIK) iOS is the ""product"" in this case, not Mobile Safari, given that the two are indivisible from the end user's perspective.<p>(Again IANAL, so this is all mostly based on lurking the Gpl-Violations.org list, reading their Vendor FAQ, and dealing with some reluctanctly GPL compliant companies.)",1304727751

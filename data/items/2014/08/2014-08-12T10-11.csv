8167276,comment,8165145,8165559,9,0,JoachimS,,,"The semiconductor industry is that - an industry with numerous companies providing the materials, equipment, operations etc needed for Intel, TSMC, Samsung to build and run their fabs.<p>In order for this to work, there is a need for coordination. The manufacturers of steppers for example must be able to deliver a stepper that can draw features with the needed resolution at a given time. Since the development takes time, they and everybody else needs to communicate and decide how fast Moores law progress.<p>Moores law thus represents what all parties agree to are what can be achieved and can meet the end user requirements over time. The industry organisation responsible for this is ITRS - The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors:<p><a href=""http://www.itrs.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itrs.net/</a><p>If one wants to see the predictions for Moores law, ITRS have documents available that are well worth studying. When I worked on ASIC design for mobile handsets we looked at these documents for product roadmaps since we could predict the power consumption, gate density etc for future process nodes.<p>Intel can to a higher degree than many others move forward at their on pacing. But they don&#x27;t make their own fab from scratch nor produce their materials all by themselves. This means that even if Intel is able to develop a process in the lab that provides smaller feature size, efficiency and whatnot than what is agreed upon. But they can&#x27;t move that much faster than the rest of the industry if they want to manufacture chips in commercial quantities.",1407841018

It&#x27;s a problem of interaction between two people, where neither is expressing clearly what their real opinion is. There&#x27;s a bit more responsibility on the person acting as boss to resolve it, as presumably he has a bit more experience with that kind of situation, but it&#x27;s a two-way street.<p>As a manager, it is normal to be more directive with someone who is underperforming due to (perceived) lack of knowledge. You do need to be clear about you doing so though, and be clear about the path away from it.<p>I had a manager a long time ago who did it in a nice way. Our office was underperforming compared to the other offices he was managing, so he explained to everyone in an all hands meeting that he would be spending more time on control activities with the goal of getting back to not doing so once we were hitting delivery targets once more. No-one took offense to that, it was more &quot;Ok, we are not performing at the level we need to be, and that means we will spend more time on control activities for a while, but to get out of that and back to our normal more laid back approach we need to do X, Y, Z.&quot;<p>The harmful situation is when you start spending more time on control activities without expressing why you are doing it and without explaining what the path out is. The responsibility for that is for sure on the boss, but also on the employee. If you are not asking &quot;Ok, I have noticed this, why is that?&quot; as an employee as well, then you are contributing to the situation and the downward spiral.",1407840558

I&#x27;ll refer back to my post from several months ago about the poor performance of the Linux network stack (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7286584"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7286584</a>).<p>> 1. Data Plane Development Kit, which lets you skip the kernel IP stack (which takes thousands of CPU cycles to process) and do packet processing in userland taking just tens to hundreds of cycles per packet. <a href=""http://dpdk.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dpdk.org/</a><p>I wish OS developers saw this as a problem. There is no reason kernel stacks should be so slow for tasks where all processing is done in the kernel. (For packets destined to userspace, you&#x27;ve got the syscall overhead to deal with.)<p>I recently tested the Linux network stack&#x27;s PPS performance with an Intel X520 10GbE NIC. I used Debian testing, with the 3.12 kernel. My destination machine was an i7-3930K at stock speed. I wrote a simple kernel module adding an NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING hook returning NF_DROP with no processing, which would be the simplest possible code path. For a packet generator, I used another older machine with another X520, using the &quot;pfsend&quot; tool included with PF_RING, and the card in PF_RING DNA mode. That was easily able to saturate the link at line rate (14.8M PPS).<p>The result: the kernel was only able to sustain about 2.8M PPS.<p>I then loaded the DNA driver on the destination machine, used the included &quot;pfcount&quot; tool, and no packet drops - it was receiving the full 14M PPS.<p>I tested DPDK recently and had similar results.<p>I also modified the Linux ixgbe driver ixgbe_clean_rx_irq() function, and added a step in between the &quot;fetch packets from RX ring&quot; and &quot;put packet in SKB and send to network stack&quot; functions. Even when I added a bunch of useless comparisons for each packet, I was able to get ~12-13M PPS. I could get line rate by just dropping and not doing any processing.<p>sidenote (not included in the above post): I also tested FreeBSD. I&#x27;m just going off memory here, but it did sustain higher PPS than Linux (same hardware) but not anywhere near line rate. So netmap, PF_RING, DPDK, others are still the way to go if you want to do line rate processing.",1407838914

8167180,comment,8164523,8167105,8,0,watwut,,,"According to accounts at the time, the original team on this project was working late nights long before the failed September deadline. Their attempts to inform government that they will not make it were cut with &quot;failure is not an option&quot;. Are you saying that this situation would be impossible with in-house team? There were reports of contractor fighting government over scope, are you saying that in-house team would win that fight?<p>There was no one in government side with power to say &quot;no&quot; to features and with power to prioritize. Are you saying that such political power would magically appear in someone if they would use in-house team? There were reports of stressed governments people coming to contractor site in person all of sudden and forcing developers to show them not done yet hopefully cool features (nope not login, none of them cared about sign up and load problems). I am not making this up. Are you saying that the same geniuses would left in-house team alone?<p>There was no one officially responsible for integration of parts done by various companies and integration testing. Would the same management put aside time and resources for that work if the companies would be replaced by in-house teams? Well, maybe a little on this one, but I doubt they would put aside enough.<p>Plenty of outsourcing contracts have set price or deadlines and penalties for breaking them. Plenty of them are not paid on hourly fee basis. At least one of contracted companies has history of failures under their belt, so they are hardly innocent in the whole failure. That does not make government management more sound. It just makes them equally guilty at worst.<p>&quot;For an in house team who do their own maintenance, the same things mean embarrassment, late nights, and possibly getting fired. So scope creep and avoidable complexity are bad for the in-house team.&quot;<p>There are few problems with this assertion:<p>* Scope creep is problem beyond the tech team. Scope creep happens to in-house teams of private companies as often as it happen to contractors. That one can be solved only someone with real political decision making power cooperates.<p>* In-house team does not get much embarrassment after failed deadline and firings usually does not happen after them. The thing is, if the management is competent, management knows the deadline will be failed in advance and have a plan for that. Deadlines are failed for various reasons overly optimistic estimates being the primary one.<p>* Most importantly, good management does not fire people after they failed important deadline due to laziness. Good management replaces lazy incapable people long before and does not assign mission critical tasks to unproven people. Management that ignores problems and then comes in all guns blazing after predictable failure is bound to build quite horrible in-house teams.<p>Managing contractors is somewhat different then managing in-house team, but both require sound management to succeed. You might be somewhat better at managing one vs another, but you are unlikely to be great in managing in-house team while being total failure in managing contractors.",1407838083

150111,comment,149968,149968,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Makes sense when you consider what they're using the money for.  Most Prosper borrowers seem to be trying to pay off credit card loans - anyone who's willing to pay 30% interest to pay off their 20% interest credit cards either isn't very bright or has no intention of paying off their Prosper loan anyway.<p>I'd like to see the numbers broken down into people who're using the money for business or education vs. people who're using it to pay off existing loans.  It seems like someone who's hoping to invest in additional capital has both more ability and more incentive to pay back a loan.",1206888429

People will react to your metaphor first (""so-and-so is dead"", ""so-and-so is a lion in a cage"" etc) instead of your main thesis. Metaphors aren't ""isomorphisms"", sorry.

150096,comment,150070,150076,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"There are two types of scans they could do.<p>The first is CAT, or Cancer Assisted Tomography. They can shoot high energy <i>cancer rays</i> (a particular type of <i>radiation</i>) through your skull and measure what comes out the other side. Tumors sometimes absorb more cancer rays (also called x-rays) than other tissue, basically creating a shadow they can see. This doesn't work all that great, also the cancer rays are also millions of times more likely to cause cancer than your iphone.<p>The other type of scan is <i>nuclear</i> magnetic resonance imaging or NMRI. In NMRI, they stick your head into a big magnet. Then they take a big cell phone transmitter, point it at your brain and turn it on (i.e., sending <i>radiation</i> into your brain). This (combined with the magnet) basically turns your brain into a nuclear powered cell phone transmitter. Then an RF coil inside the Nuclear MRI machine picks up the calls your brain makes, and they get a picture out.<p>Did I use the words <i>nuclear</i> and <i>radiation</i> frequently enough to make you afraid?",1206886899

150084,comment,149932,149932,0,0,PieSquared,,,"Whoa. Is this a good thing... or a really bad one? Not sure. C++ is complicated enough. Then again, CL is pretty complicated too, yet it's what I would qualify as a beautiful language.<p>I personally feel that C++ is a language that doesn't truly belong anywhere - it isn't pure, clean, and low-level, like C, and it isn't completely high-level. Somehow, I don't think that you can easily 'mix' these two.  I'm mildly surprised that they haven't added an optional GC yet - I seem to remember reading somewhere that even Bjarne Stourstrop advocated one.<p>Maybe, instead of making ""C++0x"", they should just make D an ISO standard... From what I've seen, D is basically C++ cleaned up, and every time I look at it, I want to use it instead even more. Check it out if you haven't already. And it deals flawlessly with legacy C++ and C code, too, so there's really not many reasons to avoid it.<p>Oh, and C++ templates are just ugly. I'm reminded of them whenever I see Java generics too, and let's just say those aren't too nice on the eyes either. Maybe they should add programmatic macros too. And a pinch of Perl's default variables!",1206885692

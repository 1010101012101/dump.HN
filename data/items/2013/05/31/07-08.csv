Chicago is right smack in the middle of the 'tongue' of the Laurentide ice sheet that sticks out way to the south - even today, without miles of ice the climate of NYC and Barcelona are quite unalike while being at the same latitude.  At the point of maximum extent global mean temperatures were already rising, there were great big gobs of the Pleistocene in which they were far lower.<p>'Mean surface temperature' is something that can be directly measured or estimated from paleometeorologic proxies but without models for the underlying mechanisms, it's pretty uninformative.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WhereIsTheHeatOfGlobalWarming.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WhereIsTheHeatOfGlobalWarm...</a><p>And the linked references give some idea of how very misleading, taken at face value, mean global temperatures can be.<p>Even just doing a bit of napkin physics - if one applied the energy needed to heat the top meter of ocean by one degree to the first meter of air, it would be like taking a blowtorch to the layer of air in question.<p>Examples like that are pithy but they're almost like walking up to a denialist and saying 'I want you to hit me in the face, as hard as you can'.",1369987105

5797391,comment,5796935,5797329,6,0,hosh,,,"One of the more subtle changes with this is, as people use the blockchain more, people's sense of authority shifts from traditional, centralized structures (institutions, governments) and more into a peer-to-peer accountability.<p>I've been on the sidelines watching a group of people try to hash out trust networks. Those really have not taken off. And I think they have not because the tokens used for trading trust don't have purchasing power for material goods the way Bitcoins does. I'm <i>guessing</i> that, while we may be tempted to just use the blockchain without the monetary use, the monetary use also makes each transaction like this matter a lot more. It might be possible that the very inefficiency is what allows the public ledger system to work at all.<p>In any case, I see much farther down the road where ... the big issue is not whether a nation-state actor's ability to issue currency is undermined by bitcoin, or even its ability to regulate it, but more that many other functions of government could eventually be expressed with Bitcoin or its technological successor.<p>Patents are interesting. What about real estate? Closing and transferring real estate takes a lot of paperwork, with mortgages enforced by powers of eviction and repossession.<p>I talked with a lawyer buddy of mine's about this subject a while ago. He tells me, the court system will be the last to convert over electronically. Legal papers have a gravitas associated with authority and control that is difficult to convert into electronic form.<p>Ultimately (and maybe not in this generation), wide-spread use of the public ledger will undermine deep-seated social conventions, emotional attachments, and notions we have about 'authority' and 'institutions.' Or maybe it'll be like the Millennials. All the folk who grew up in a time before wide-spread public ledgers die off; notions of central authorities becoming a quaint chapter in human history.",1369986780

If the service was clay and then you have bullish management that wants to change the product for the worse all the time for their own wants, your words would be correct.<p>That's not the case with most web services though. The target of social networks is everyone. A social network where people would prefer to post more privately would breed a more private atmosphere. A social network where only a certain type of people would post publicly would draw in only those type of culture until the dominant culture drives what the real target market really is.<p>Target market segregation only come into play when a product is not yet launched. After it has been launched, the point is for the people in charge to use it to discover who are the people using the product and to mold it to both of their needs. Especially with an ambitious project like Google Plus, if you can't draw in people from all places especially people who is closest to your circle, chances are the product isn't meeting the intended appeal of ANY target market and with Google's history of cancelling products that don't meet that appeal (Buzz, Wave) that doesn't bode confidence even for the right target market when articles like this gets written.",1317786869

Apple has integrated first-party apps beautifully, but heard not a peep about third-party services. Neither web services nor native apps can disclose their offerings to Siri.<p>The easy answer is that Apple doesn't want Siri competing with their app market.<p>I don't think it's so simple, and I don't think Apple is so short-sighted. After all, if someone's going to make your business obsolete, you want it to be you. Everyone and their grandmother has an app store now. What makes Apple's store distinctive is not only the quality of the apps, but the depth of the apps. Fart apps are obviously shallow (they're semantically non-existent), but a native port of a web service is pretty shallow too. How many verbs are required to interface with craigslist? How many kinds of nouns exist on Yelp? These apps have the capacity to be supplanted by Siri integration, but Apple missed the boat.<p>I'm comforted by Apple's admission that this is ""beta"" software. iOS didn't ship with any SDK (despite the obvious potential), and the reason turned out to be as innocuous as ""it wasn't ready.""<p>We've glimpsed the post-app world.

Just curious, how many people have been working on this?<p>One small thing is that you should maybe allow people to view a sample trip from your main page (maybe also a link to something like <a href=""http://zipalong.com/zip/TripAnimation.page?tripId=42887183"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zipalong.com/zip/TripAnimation.page?tripId=42887183</a>) 
When I arrived on the main page, I tried clicking on the map and it didn't work and I would have closed the page if I wasn't coming from here to give feedback. I almost didn't click on the What is Zipalong? link.
Your tour is slick, well made and made me want to sign up though but I usually prefer seeing a real use case rather than a tour usually.",1231473467

We were required to use Poseidon for UML, but it was such a pain and crashed so often that we ended up making all our UML Diagrams in Dia (which is a nice enough and lightweight program, if slightly clunky; you might want to check it out). Yet instead of being pleased or even just ambivalent about the entire enterprise, our teacher got mad that we used a tool other than the prescribed one. I never really understood why people would get pissy about what tools you used instead of focusing on the actual output.",1231472578

Or at least call into question his fundamental competence as a leader. If American Apparel can manufacture low margin clothing efficiently enough to beat the sweatshops (in California no less), then anyone should be able to. If they try hard enough.""<p>I think he's misunderstanding why their business model works. Sending your commodity product to China to be make extra-cheaply is one strategy. Building a high quality product that proudly displays it's Made-In-America-ness and tugs at our patriotic heartstrings while charging 2x the price as the Chinese-outsourced competition is another. There is room, in almost every industry, for both a Kia and Lexus.<p>And you do have to outsource to find cheap labor. $12-$15/hr with full benefits is not cheap for a factory. I'm guessing he just misphrased what he meant on that one.",1231472555

426118,comment,425186,425769,0,0,hapless,,,"UNIX software is not perfectly portable.  Portable software is less likely to run on niche systems.  The fewer users that a particular platform has, the less likely it is that portability issues particular to that platform have been discovered and fixed.<p>It has been my experience that one is more likely to find portability bugs in software when one tries to build it on Interix/SFU/SUA than when one attempts to build on Cygwin.<p>There are only two reasons to use SUA:<p>- Interix/SFU/SUA has the advantage that much of its system calls are implemented in a kernel driver, just like native system calls.  Cygwin hits a userspace emulation layer for many calls, and that incurs a performance cost.<p>- Cygwin is third party.  Interix/SFU/SUA comes from Microsoft.<p>- Interix/SFU/SUA includes some fairly useful NIS/NFS integration stuff.  It's not great, but it's better than nothing.<p>Whether you choose SFU or Cygwin, UNIX software ported to a compatibility layer is generally more pleasant than native hosted software.  ActivePerl and native Apache are just a pain in the ass compared to Cygwin/SFU's implementations.",1231471500

Instead, headshots are either comically squished or creepily elongated, a carnivalesque effect that makes it difficult to quickly size up potential mates.<p>Frind is aware of his site's flaws but isn't eager to fix them. ""There's no point in making trivial adjustments,"" he says. Frind's approach -- and the reason he spends so little time actually working -- is to do no harm. This has two virtues: First, you can't waste money if you are not doing anything. And second, on a site this big and this complex, it is impossible to predict how even the smallest changes might affect the bottom line. Fixing the wonky images, for instance, might actually hurt Plenty of Fish. Right now, users are compelled to click on people's profiles in order to get to the next screen and view proper headshots. That causes people to view more profiles and allows Frind, who gets paid by the page view, to serve more ads. ""The site works,"" he says. ""Why should I change what works?""",1231470584

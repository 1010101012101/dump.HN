391749,comment,391515,391515,0,0,blasdel,,,"I had a great question in a job interview yesterday: ""What do you like least about your least favorite programming language?"". I picked Ruby as my least favorite, as there's not many languages out there that undermine themselves so totally (I may not want to program in basic, but it does what it says on the tin). Here's my answer:<p><pre><code>  Matz's decision-making process
    He tries to make Ruby be all things to all people
      Lots of confusing sugar and overloading baked in
    I much prefer Guido's hard pragmatism
  
  The panoply of function types: Methods, Blocks, Procs, Lambdas
    All intertwined and yielding into one another.
    I love that in Python there is only one:
      Objects with a __call__ method, defined metacircularly.
  
  The culture of adding/overloading methods on base classes
    Many gems do this en masse, and there are a lot of low-quality gems
    Especially disastrous because it's unscoped, and infects the whole process
      For a language with four scoping sigils it sure screws up scope a lot
  
  The Matz Ruby Implementation
    The opposite of turtles-all-the-way-down (Smalltalk crushed beneath Perl)
    It punishes you for taking advantage of Ruby's strengths
    The standard library is written almost entirely in C
      It doesn't use Ruby message dispatch to call other C code.
      That means that if you overload a built-in, other built-ins won't use it
    Anything fiddly that's not written in C will be dog slow</code></pre>",1228855888

391729,comment,391515,391515,0,0,lsb,,,"It's a fundamental problem of language design.<p>In Lisp, extending the built-in functions is trivial, so lots of people built Lisp up into the language to solve their problem in, and Ruby makes it easy to do the same.  Rails is extends the language, and some people like it.  Even the JSON gem does -- when you do ""require 'json'"", you give arrays the power to convert themselves to json strings. Ruby lets you convert arrays to Ruby-evallable strings, so it's natural to convert them to JSON-parseable strings.<p>So, do you do what Java does, in making the String class final?  Languages only exist for people who speak them, so you need to gauge the social aspects whenever you choose a language.  Perhaps Java means that your bozo coworker won't trample your toes.  Perhaps Haskell means that you can import just as much as you want.  That's ultimately your call.<p>There are lots of valid complaints about Ruby 1.8: the syntax can be baroque, the scoping rules have too many gotchas, they're (thinking of) taking out continuations in the next version, the VM is dog-slow.

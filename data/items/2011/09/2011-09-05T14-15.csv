Which is to say, deletion commands like x and dd store the deleted content in the register that will be used when you hit p or P. This is important to know both because it can be <i>very</i> useful sometimes and because it can get in your way other times (e.g., if you're trying to repeat an action and keep replacing a line with another line, you'll have to paste before you delete so you don't override your register).",1315234745

I don't think it has to do with citizenship specifically; someone who moves to the U.S. and stays there the rest of their lives, but never actually becomes a citizen (you can live indefinitely with a green card) would still be an immigrant to the US. Someone whose company sends them on a temporary 3-year posting to the U.S., though, typically wouldn't be considered an immigrant, but an expatriate.

Whether this takes the form of 4chan's ""photo with a shoe on your head"" or Reddit's ""Post about this to your twitter account"", reliably associating a pseudonym to a meatspace person is easy. So you can get the advantages of the 'transparent' system in a pseudonymous system <i>if you want them</i>, but you're never forced to.<p>The only way to properly run a transparent system is to force everyone to identify themselves. Then you can't get any of the benefits of anonymity.<p>The only people pushing for 'transparent systems' are people who have some material gain from them - advertisers, information miners, law enforcement etc. I think they have enough power as it is.<p>So I'm in favour of anonymity by default, keeping the choice to be transparent in the hands of the individual.",1315234548

2962361,comment,2961095,2962144,2,0,Spyro7,,,"<i>""Who gets to decide what the right outcomes are and whether they are efficient?""</i><p>Whether or not an outcome is ""right"" is subjective, and is more in the field of law and philosophy than economics.<p>Whether or not an outcome is efficient for society does not need to be determined as it can be measured. An outcome is efficient for society if it makes at least one individual better off without leaving any other individuals worse off. (This is Pareto efficiency).<p>Of course in the real world, there will almost always be winners and losers with any policy change. The solution is thus to make sure that the total net benefits of any policy change is positive.<p>The net benefits are the benefits (both implied and explicit) of a policy minus both the costs of doing the policy and the costs of potential gains that could have been had by pursuing alternative policies. Both the costs and the benefits should be aggregates that include the costs and the benefits to all parties affected by a policy.<p>One thing that I think is worth thinking about when you look at recent developments in the markets is this. From the time period of roughly the 1950s to roughly the 1980s this form of detailed cost-benefit analysis was popularly employed by both governments and private companies. (I am not actually this old, but I have heard this story multiple times from economists considerably more seasoned than me).<p>Unfortunately, starting in the 1980s, a more expedient form of cost-benefit analysis that focuses mostly on the immediate costs and benefits to the organization conducting the analysis began to dominate. This type of analysis was championed by the finance and accounting oriented economists that began to spring up at around this time. (Disagreement over this and other issues led to university economics departments around the nation dividing from business departments and finding a new home - and less funding - with the liberal arts and social sciences.)<p>It is expensive and time-consuming to conduct a thorough impact analysis, so I can understand why the more academic approach would fade away in favor of something more expedient. However, I think that a lot of the recent problems we see in governance can be traced to this fast-food economic analysis:<p>* Lack of investment in infrastructure? - Well, this report on my desk says that it will be expensive to fix those roads and the ones we have now seem to be holding up just fine<p>* Internet providers want to throttle bandwidth based on its source? - Makes sense, according to this report on my desk providing bandwidth obviously costs money - why not charge for it?<p>* A tax on transactions? - Well, this report on my desk says that would make it more expensive to trade stocks - there's no way this could be beneficial.<p>While the right answers to many of these questions can be found either in economic journals or by speaking with an independent consultant, policymakers rarely have the enthusiasm for a topic to dive so deeply.<p>I hope that soul-searching due to the financial meltdown brings the old approach back in favor. It is sorely missed.",1315234532

I thought I was mature, which in many ways I probably was, but I also had too much conviction in my own opinions which is definitely a sign of immaturity.<p>Being passionate is good, make sure you don't lose it but learn to control it too.",1315233832

It's rare for someone who worked at a company to have such good perspective.<p>It's definitely true that the main reason why Opera has struggled on the desktop is because of a lack of polish. The UI has always felt clunky, non-native and awkward.<p>That is a major reason why I switched from Opera to Firefox (née Phoenix) many years ago and haven't looked back since. UI has always been their weak link, while their performance and rendering engine has always been top-notch.<p>Having tried Opera 11.5 for the first time, it's certainly a huge leap forward. It's not perfect, but it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb like previous versions. The downside is that it's a bit too close to Firefox/Chrome to provide a compelling reason to switch, and it still has too much irrelevent crap front-and-centre coupled with its own UI quirks (e.g. why is ""Show menu"" in the ""File"" menu and not in 'View'?). Even so, a vast improvement.<p>I think it's far too easy to blame their low marketshare on their miniscule marketing budget. Mozilla faced similar problems. Mozilla failed when they had a crap product in SeaMonkey (née Mozilla Suite) and succeded when they had a compelling product in Firefox. If Opera can create a similarly compelling product, I have no doubt that many people would happily switch.<p>I think Opera's best approach would be to focus on Opera Mobile. Mobile is the browser growth market, I suspect it's easier to convince users to try a mobile browser than a desktop one, and they should be able to translate mobile marketshare into desktop marketshare.",1315233253

Fewer physical books equals less knowledge.<p>You need a librarian who knows how to navigate all the books.<p>You need a critical mass of library workers (who need not have library science training) to reshelve and process all the books.<p>Because mice and rats and bugs and molds may eat your hundred-year-old books, you need to exclude food and drink from your library.<p>Because it's inefficient to move lots of books through long distances, the scholars are going to park themselves in the library, packed cheek-by-jowl at adjacent tables. To a scholar the desk that's within a few steps of a comprehensive library is the most valuable real estate on earth. So libraries traditionally enforce quiet, and build arrays of private study carrels, and force public gatherings to take place in special soundproof meeting rooms somewhere in the building.<p>Obviously, to house all those physical books in a patron-browseable format you need a pretty big and nifty building.<p>But the future, assuming the righteous librarians finally deal with all this infernal DRM, will be different.

That is, the first person who eventually settled in a country other than the one they were born in, regardless of country (i.e. this is not intended to be US-immigrant-centric).<p>Choose only the one answer which corresponds to the most recent immigration. So, for example, if your father is the 3rd generation since immigration but your mother is, herself, an immigrant you would choose ""1 generation"". The hypothesis we're testing is that the sort of entrepreneurial, adventure-seeking personality that is overrepresented on HN correlates with a willingness to pick up and leave your comfort zone completely.",1315232337

2962221,comment,2962057,2962125,18,0,adgar,,,"<i>they are implemented via some kind of alternate ""cruft path"" using micro-ops that requires extra decode steps, pipeline flush, etc. that slows the processor down.</i><p>This is exactly the case.<p>Just a few minutes ago I was implementing a parse tree data structure my thesis advisor commonly uses. It encodes the number of types of children of each node as a pair of bits, ordered from least-significant to most-significant. If the nth child is a leaf node, it's encoded as `10`, and if it's an internal node, it's `11`. I implement the ""number of children"" function as a loop, shifting this pattern right by 2 until the value is zero.<p>Naturally, x86 has a useful opcode for this: BSR, bit-scan right. It tells you the index of the first set (1) bit scanning from most-significant to least-significant. It returns the index from 0=LSB, 31=MSB. In theory, this takes my O(n) solution and makes it O(1). I just BSR the pattern, shift right 1, add 1. I know it's a micro-optimization anyway, but I want to have some fun on labor day, so I give it a shot.<p>In practice, since the number of children is always 8 or fewer (this is for Ruby's grammar), the loop is always very short. Even while running 10,000,000 iterations to get the total time up to a few seconds, and even while using `rand` to try to trick the branch predictor (to make the looping case less predictable), I couldn't get a discernable difference to show up between O(1) and O(n). The O(n) case was definitely executing at least 3-4 times as many instructions in the test I was running, so I can only conclude BSR is deoptimized.<p>Edit: DarkShikari says that the deoptimization may be because I'm on an Athlon 64 processor and that this is not the case on intel processors.",1315231695

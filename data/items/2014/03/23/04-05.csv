Yes you can manage your own keys as an end user for your cryptocurrency holdings, but as you say most end users will prefer to work through a third party that will handle the complexities of key management for them.<p>The trick is though that there can be an infinite amount of third parties all engaged in competition with each other and the end users just participate in that market like they would any other.<p>OP&#x27;s suggestion may well work the same way, certain end users could choose to handle their own key management, and there could be third parties that handle it for those that prefer not to. As long as the space for those third parties is infinite and end users can opt to handle key management themselves, it&#x27;s still a decentralised solution.",1395550682

Despite this, it can also genuinely be the best choice for certain applications, and so there is a need for a FAQ such as this one.<p>But it&#x27;s not &quot;essential&quot; that any such reference be accompanied by a recitation of the reasons the language sucks (some of them legitimate, even).  The FAQ is for people using a tool to make things; the FQA seems primarily used to score points in discussions such as this one.*  I think working programmers generally have more use for the former.<p>* There is also a need for constructive criticism of language design choices, of course, but the FQA predominantly rejects C++&#x27;s design premises (such as static compile-time polymorphism and lack of a memory-managed runtime) rather than recognize their utility and suggest better ways to accomplish them (as Mozilla is trying to do with Rust).",1395550538

So from the potential employee side, it is reasonable to assume that they are going to get paid around the &quot;market rate&quot;.<p>The Valley seems to be at a point where &quot;starting/not starting a startup&quot; is becoming an IQ test (compared to &quot;market rate&quot;) financially if you think you are reasonably good at doing stuff, so it is natural that good engineers wouldn&#x27;t go and apply for a job, because the expectation for compensation is unlikely to be satisfactory anyway (or at least that&#x27;s what they believe and prevents them from trying).<p>>And you dodged my questions.<p>Oh, I am not the OP and I&#x27;m not pretending to have the answers.

Certain banks/credit cards have relationships with foreign institutions that can cause unexpectedly low fees, given the right circumstances.  On top of which, I&#x27;ve found that both Western Union and bank-to-bank transfers, on the whole, are a huge ripoff on both rates and fees--especially for frequent, small volume scenarios.<p>When I worked in Canada, I used the no-ATM-fee agreement [1] between ScotiaBank and Bank of America to convert USD to CAD and transfer money between the accounts.  This involved the rather odd procedure of going to a ScotiaBank ATM, withdrawing a lot of CAD off of the USD in the BofA account, and stuffing the cash right back into the ATM as a deposit on the ScotiaBank account.  Any other procedure, including using a teller or trying an online wire transfer, would have been more expensive and inconvenient.  The above had no per-transaction fees and only a 3% conversion fee added to the market rate, which is about average compared to credit cards.  (Any of Western Union&#x27;s &quot;instant&quot; options for this kind of transaction require about 9% in fees.)<p>There are some credit cards with no foreign transaction fees, which is what I would use today if I had to do it again.  Using such a card to purchase items in the foreign country, and then paying off the balance with the home country bank, results in &quot;free&quot; currency conversion.

That&#x27;s easy to block, or legally compel to remove content. Imagine instead that every user on twitter had their own &quot;stream&quot; replicated on both their own computer and those of all of their followers. If you choose to follow someone, you get access to their stream either directly from the person themselves, or any of their other followers.<p>This would partition the system according to popularity. The more followed a person is, the more replicas of their tweet stream available. When someone retweets something, it appears in their own stream, so retweets benefit from this replication. Any tweets that are particularly important and popular would be virtually impossible to suppress.<p>To prove that tweets had originated from a particular user, every user would have a public/private key pair generated when they first begin using the system, and all tweets would carry an associated cryptographic signature. &quot;Registering&quot; for the system would be a matter of generating an identity using a key pair and a username. Clashes and impersonation of usernames is something I haven&#x27;t yet thought of a solution to, though usernames would be for display purposes only; the real identity would be the public key.<p>Replica discovery is another challenge, but there&#x27;s much in the existing P2P literature and practice (esp bittorrent) that could possibly be of help here.<p>As far as business models are concerned, Twitter&#x27;s current one wouldn&#x27;t work, as it relies on the centralised nature of the system. However it would be possible for developers of individual clients to make money by providing various value-adds, and these could co-exist with open source clients.<p>Thoughts?<p>Side note: There seems to be a bug in the comments system where the last paragraph is omitted.

177030,comment,176608,176918,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""3) we are very definitely not fixing these problems: the level of cleantech investment is tiny, etc.""<p>KP has $600mil earmarked for green/cleantech.  Sequoia has stated numerous times that they are actively looking for green/cleantech (McAdoo used the term ""browntech"" in his talk at Startup School but no one else seems to know what that means).  These two are, admittedly, the top of the VC food chain, and they've been so successful by being ahead of the curve just a wee bit more than the rest of the industry.  But, where they go, the rest of the industry will follow.<p>I think you're underestimating how much people in the valley are thinking about the big problems that they are able to solve--the global economy is a two stage process, involving both government (the largest degree, and something that startups can't have a notable effect on) and business (the big ones that already have clout...startups don't have the power to affect global economic change, though Google and Microsoft do to a degree).  But energy is definitely getting attention in the valley.  Virtualization is a huge and growing market, partly because it saves tremendously on power requirements in the data center, and lots of money and time is being spent on it.  Batteries, boring old batteries, are getting funded.<p>I think the problem is that you're expecting software and hardware people to move into a completely different field.  Sure, some really smart people are working on stuff that might not meet your definition of solving big problems...but if they switch gears to a completely different field (which most of your specified problems are) it'll take years for them to get up to speed on those subjects.  Big problems take a lot of research and a lot of knowledge to solve.  Most startup guys are not independently wealthy--they need to make their startup pay quickly or they have to go back to their cubicle at MegaCorp and solve even smaller problems and waste away wishing for what could have been.<p>But, as I mentioned, the money is flowing into energy related startups, and the rate of flow is increasing.  Startups will follow the money.",1209505847

177026,comment,176999,176999,0,0,dkokelley,,,"Absolutely I would. I would have my own station built that I could travel to when I'm feeling like a vacation. It would have a rotating deck to simulate gravity, and I could stay there in case of anything serious happening on earth.<p>I would also like a ship that could take me to the moon and other places as well. That way I could go on ""road trips"" when I'm on vacation in my orbiting space hotel.<p>The criticism of space travel is that there are other things that you could spend your money on, or other problems that need to be corrected here on earth, before moving on. This classifies the act of space travel as recreational, which I think is untrue. Think about the explorers thousands of years ago. Sure, there were other things the government and other wealthy people could have spent their money on - decent roads or aqueducts/sewage systems are good examples. But so much came out of their exploration and expansion, and I think that space exploration by our wealthy individuals will produce solutions that can be applied on earth as well as in space. Wasn't Velcro supposed to come out of the race to the moon?",1209505458

Basically, go for real people as customers unless you're selling a bug-tracking app or tech news app or something else that is only pertinent to geeks.<p>Geeks are less willing to pay for a product or service, because their interest in new startups is largely a technical curiosity and/or a competitive curiosity.  The people that are on the cutting-edge of technology are also constantly looking for the next thing, so they lose interest quickly.  Non-geeks are much more likely to pay you and to continue paying you if your service actually helps them.  An app is likely to be remarkable (in the literal sense) for geeks if it has a unique architecture or was written in an unusual language, etc., whereas an app can be very remarkable/viral among non-geeks as long as it is useful.<p>In sum: If you want a business, go after non-geeks.

If you treat newbies like they're dumb, they'll never learn how to write ""real"" code.  The only way they'll do that is by reading real idiomatic code.<p><i>Slices and adding lists will probably always return new lists in python, but it is still good not to depend on such behaviour.</i><p>Not buying this.  The behavior is documented and Python has a deprecation cycle for changes in documented behavior.<p>The reason to write list(x) is because that's the generic way to turn anything into a list.

3201732,comment,3200096,3200659,2,0,6ren,,,"Even today's smartphones aren't ""simple"" terminals (and probably <i>much</i> more powerful than the mainframes he envisioned). The closest to that model is SSH and Onlive gaming. The trend is for webapps to do as much processing on the client as possible, and use the backend mainly for data. So I think he was wrong (and the article is also wrong in saying he was vindicated).\nPeople have constantly predicted a mainframe model; but cheaper, simpler and more convenient processing devices keep seeping computing power towards the user. That is: processing power migrates to the edge of the network. But I don't think incorrect predictions of the far future should in any way be held against McCarthy.<p>AI tangent: my thoughts on a ""hivemind"" vs ""individuals"" (mainframe vs. distributed) is similar to capitalism vs. a planned economy - individuals can collect data from their own viewpoint; form their own hypotheses; and act on them locally. Of course, theoretically, a hivemind with the same processing power could do the same with waldos; however, I think it would be difficult to resist consolidating hypotheses, and concentrating on the best ones (as large companies kill off small projects that later disrupt them). Whereas, individuals will do things their own way - and some of them will come up with something better (like ants searching for sugar; or startups seeking disruption). Most of them end up dead of course. There's also practical concerns favouring distribution: network latency/bandwidth; power consumption and redundancy (not all eggs in one basket).",1320549613

In the height of summer it is bright at 4 am, and dark at 7pm.  However, the timezone is so ridiculously wide that any change to create a later summer evening means that for some people, it would be  blazingly hot at 7pm and not dark until closer to 9pm.<p>Society adopted timezones as a measure of co-ordination for things like rail timetables and telephone calls.  Prior to that, everyone set noon to 'true noon'.<p>In reality, more timezones should be introduced, possibly sliced down to the 30 minutes.

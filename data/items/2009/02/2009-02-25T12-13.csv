Rock has few private investors as clients and hence is under little outside pressure. Rock invests slices of his own fortune and the money of a few close friends, limiting himself to three or four deals a year. He makes sure that the companies he finances are close to his office so that he does not have to travel much. Rock looks for ideas, people and products that together can form the keystones for major new industries. He is almost always one step ahead of fashion and never expects a quick payoff. He makes up his mind swiftly, acts decisively, moves quietly and seems to have an impeccable sense for where technology and markets will meet.

The EU does more trade with OPEC than the US and would certainly welcome a monopoly petroeuro exchange system.

The EU is now the largest economy in the world (not the US) and China’s largest trading partner is the EU (not the US). When America’s financial house of cards collapse the UK may have little choice but to finally join the Eurozone for survival.

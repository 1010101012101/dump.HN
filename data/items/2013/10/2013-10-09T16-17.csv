6522379,comment,6519175,6519633,2,0,FigBug,,,"A few year ago I worked for a company that offered a similar service, but was more focused on labels than individual artists. Even though iTunes, Amazon, Spotify and Play may be there big ones there are 100s of music stores, plus ring tones, call back tones, lyrics sites, user generated content sites (youtube, vimeo etc) etc that need to get the latest content, either the music or just the metadata. There are new sites springing up and dying regularly.<p>When a site starts up, they don&#x27;t need to go cut individual deals and setup the transfer technology with every label and artist. They can approach a few companies like the one I worked for, write a plugin and get a huge amount of content right away. The labels don&#x27;t want to monitor every site that starts up and send content and handle royalties. They could set usage rules and the content would be sent to the appropriate sites.<p>Once sites get huge like iTunes, they cut their own deals with the major labels. But without services like this there is no way small artists and music sites could ever survive, it would be far too time consuming.",1381337745

6522277,comment,6520899,6522041,7,0,rbehrends,,,"That&#x27;s not the original issue. The problem is that the compiler silently predefines an undocumented macro. If the compiler silently predefined an undocumented variable, type, or function called &quot;linux&quot; or &quot;unix&quot;, that too can be a problem. E.g., if there were a global function linux() on Linux systems only and you tried to define a global variable linux in your code, you&#x27;d get an error, too.<p>The clean solution is to do what clang does and generate informative error messages. In the case of macros, by showing the macro expansion history. For example, the following (using __STDC__ instead of linux for portability):<p><pre><code>  foo.c:2:7: error: expected identifier or &#x27;(&#x27;
    int __STDC__ = 1;
        ^
  <built-in>:159:18: note: expanded from here
  #define __STDC__ 1
</code></pre>
Note that there can be other reasons to have macros that are syntactically different from functions and variables, but this isn&#x27;t one of them.",1381336565

However, the first &quot;hit&quot; (outlined in the Maryland indictment) seems to have been more of a set piece entrapment-alike. This was when he popped his online-hitman cherry, and it was the most difficult one for him. He seems quite distraught and upset in the messages, he has trusted this guy (&quot;The Employee&quot;) as an admin, he loaned him the money for the &quot;substance that would test positive as cocaine&quot;, he likely socialized with him and revealed a great deal of personal information.<p>I think the Feds played him (Ross Ulbricht) in this case and totally set him up for a fall. I accept that he stepped off that cliff himself, but I think it is likely that he was guided the whole way there by the Feds.<p>After this first hit, orchestrated from start to finish (?) by the feds, the second one seemed easier. He had learned to live with himself after the deed was done, he had pushed beyond that moral barrier of &quot;don&#x27;t have other people tortured and killed&quot;, and he had learned that violence can solve problems.<p>Now, as to whether this second &quot;hit&quot; was just him negotiating with a scammer, or whether he believed he was actually having someone killed. I think it is clear that without that first job, that first hand held walk through the dark side of the underground, he wouldn&#x27;t have reacted that way.<p>I think he would have been less susceptible to the manipulations of the feds if he was in a normal social peer group.

What makes one communication method okay to not expect privacy from, and another to make it a right?<p>Is it the use of standard encryption methods?  Is it the intent of the owner?  Should it be technical capability?<p>So, when you say that people should be able to engage in total privacy, and I say they can do that already, my follow up is to clarify what you really mean.  Clearly, I was wrong (despite you agreeing to what was said).  Their are limitations on a person&#x27;s rights to engage and expect total privacy.<p>And this might all seem pedantic, but it&#x27;s really the core issue, because even you realize that not all methods qualify for a level of privacy.<p>Where do we draw the line, because all the discussions seem to miss that crucial mark.<p>So yes, when I was asked that loaded question, it&#x27;s because it was assuming intent that simply didn&#x27;t exist.<p>I&#x27;ve learned my lesson though.  Next time, instead of trying to say only what I mean to say, I&#x27;ll add a bunch of words and sentences, maybe repeat myself a few times, and state my position, despite the fact that it shouldn&#x27;t matter.<p>Edit: In case theirs any question as to why I&#x27;m asking these things, it&#x27;s because of comments like this:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6519416"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6519416</a><p>&quot;All you should really have to have in order to keep a conversation private is the intentions.&quot;<p>Suddenly, I&#x27;m violating rights just because I happen to overhear someone talking quietly in public.",1381335086

Judaism doesn&#x27;t need to go viral. Rather, I&#x27;m saying that Judaism&#x27;s numbers have historically been threatened, and strict bans on (or at least strong stigmatization of) marriage outside the faith is self limiting.<p>If I&#x27;m a Jewish man and I want to marry a gentile woman, why shouldn&#x27;t my children be considered Jewish, provided I raise them in a Jewish tradition, culture, and set of values? Why should we intentionally threaten the preservation of the worldwide Jewry by placing such a limitation on organic growth? When I say &quot;growth,&quot; I&#x27;m not talking about expansion, per se; I&#x27;m talking about being able to maintain the numbers at a rate faster than they can decline.<p><i>&quot;That&#x27;s why there are few Jews, but they own the world.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m not going to touch this sort of comment, sorry.",1381334447

I&#x27;m not nearly as good at it as the winners of this prize though haha.<p>I&#x27;m glad to see computational research is becoming more popular and accepted.  There&#x27;s a (quickly diminishing) subset of scientists who think computational work is too theoretical, inaccurate, and inapplicable to real-life.  This was the case when the field was developed, but it is no longer true.<p>The exponentially increasing computational power is allowing discoveries that simply <i>can not</i> be performed experimentally because laboratory technology just isn&#x27;t advanced or capable enough.  Who needs to actually study reality if you can just simulate what you need -- and the end result is the same?<p>I&#x27;m not sure many people know this, but our understanding of the laws of physics is advanced enough nowadays to describe almost perfectly everything we observe in everyday life.  (Exceptions include things like quantum gravity which don&#x27;t really matter [ducks to avoid physicists]).<p>The problem is that if you want to simulate these laws, it requires a <i>lot</i> of computational power.  Brute-force approaches are simply ineffective and so simplifications and clever techniques must be developed to reduce the computational effort while giving increasingly accurate results.  I think it&#x27;s the combination of improving computational resources and improving simulation algorithms that are really driving this field.",1381334440

That minorities were/are imported and abused plays a role only insofar as existing racism and social stratification perpetuates the disadvantages they suffer.<p>However, flogging will not eliminate racism or social stratification; if anything, it will do the opposite.",1381334425

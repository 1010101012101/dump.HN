My comment was related to recent and compelling research into motivation in creative work. It seemed related. I'm not sure I mentioned my pay grade.<p>Having one's eye on the bottom line is different from being subject to an incentive program, and different still from being competent. The latter is the more to the point. Anyone can be greedy. Even the incompetent. In fact, due to the Dunning-Kruger effect, it might even be suspected that the incompetent are likely to feel more entitled to a higher wage than the competent.<p>I am not your buddy.

1476892,comment,1476723,1476723,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"I have a simple theory. Most managers are still educated according to Taylor's Scientific Theory of Management, where the managers are more intelligent than the ""factors of production,"" and their role is to ""scientifically"" direct their work so that they create additional value (which is multiplied by how many workers they have reporting to them). Their salaries reflect that model, and thus is proportional to the salaries of their direct reports times the number of direct reports they have. This is well-ingrained in the workplace, and in society.<p>Unfortunately programming is really the first discipline where the primary determinant of the ""factor's"" productivity is not the manager's skill but actually the intelligence of each individual. There's huge conflicts created, not just about salaries, but job roles, and really the structure of society (which is really built around an educated managerial class overseeing (and living apart from) a less educated working class.<p>The primary issue with paying programmers more is that they're butting up against those managerial salaries and life roles. Programming doesn't fit Taylor's theory. To change that isn't just about micro changes in business, it's about macro-changes in society.",1277952792

1476819,comment,1476086,1476784,0,0,atom_robot,,,"I understand what you're saying. I read your reply after I had already posted. But Honestly iBooks is doing it wrong anyway.. It seems like it was put in as a hack, because it changes the systems brightness permanently whereas instapaper and kindle seem to be based on a percentage of the current system brightness. Which would make sense if it's a layer that they're changing the transparency of. I don't, however, think this is malicious in its intent, though it is a bit unfair. Same with the lock screen stuff. It is probably safe to say that this is something Apple will open to developers eventually... after they're done playing.<p>Apple should just flag apps that use private API's and call them out for it when the user upgrades the OS in an alert dialogue-like fashion when they launch the app (or on the applications iTunes page). ""This app is using private API's and may not function properly with your current firmware."" Instead of rejection. But it's probably easier to reject than to publish a ""purchase at your own risk"" disclaimer. All that's going to do is get a lot of people to not purchase your application.<p>The AppStore acceptance and rejection policys, though, should get fully investigated. I would like to get into iOS development, but trusting my livelihood on such a seemingly fickle process makes me really nervous.",1277950281

There are also a ton of people out there that mistake higher percentile technical competence with software development competence. This recently got posted to HN and sums up the overall situation nicely:<p><a href=""http://www.rethinkdb.com/blog/2010/06/will-the-real-programmers-please-stand-up/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rethinkdb.com/blog/2010/06/will-the-real-programm...</a><p>Pay is but one factor, and resume (or job description) plus salary requirements aren't going to communicate what you really need to know. More than 90% of the jobs I've interviewed for had laughable interview processes. I've asked harder questions of my interviewers than they've ever asked of me. Most people just don't get it.<p>A ""competent"" developer needs to be hard working, interested in your particular problem set, and like the work environment you've created. You need to dig in and find out what this person is really about. Even if they're competent they may not like your company, idea, or even you. These are things you, and they, need to find out before the hire.<p>You/They aren't finding competence because you/they aren't looking for it.",1277949743

Noted psychologist Albert Ellis wrote a book on it in the 50&#x27;s or 60&#x27;s, when society&#x27;s itch was mostly satisfied through gristly pulp detective novels. The reader (or viewer, or listener) gets to indulge in graphic death and horror, but also gets to maintain their view of themselves through a narrative that allows them to think of themselves on the &#x27;good guys&#x27; side.",1416808792

I did not know that becoming a bank holding company required prior federal permission. I thought it was a regulated state that any financial institution could elect into. I thought Goldman and other investment banks had avoided it previously because the regs cramped their style.<p>I also don&#x27;t see how that places them within a taxpayer safety net. The two biggest bank &quot;safety nets&quot; I can think of are the Federal Reserve discount window and the FDIC. Neither spend taxpayer money; they are both self-funding.",1416808210

There are literally dozens of other languages that have an identical genesis.<p>I think you found AutoIt to be simple and easy because it&#x27;s not a general-purpose language. It has a very specific use-case and domain.<p>I really wonder if you know how unbelievably complex and difficult it is to create a new language. Even very minor considerations become incredibly important for certain applications.<p>If you really want to get this language off the ground, I&#x27;d suggest targeting JVM[1], CLR[2], or transpiling to JavaScript (basically the same targets as Clojure).<p>Before you go any further, you should also actually spend some time with the new kids on the block. D is a direct successor to C++. Go is a C++ replacement. Rust is a general-purpose language aimed at web applications, and it was partly the inspiration for Swift.<p>All of these are many years old, have the backing of a large corporation, are written by teams of brilliant people, or some combination of those things.

There is no practical way to be a GPU vendor today and hoard your IP.<p>Patent trolls though. A different story. In 5 years we were sued twice (that I know of) by trolls. On both occasions the trolls had some trivial enhancement to a well known technique. I imagine they are  operating a mud slinging operation where eventually something sticks. Once it does then either (1) the cost of licensing this &#x27;new&#x27; tech is priced less than legal costs or (2) the troll is looking for testimony from some respected entity that the tech is innovative which gives them validation to go after the next biggest vendor up the chain.",1416806791

If you have a LinkedIn try and get them to endorse you. If you think you left them really happy ask for a quote/recommendation (maybe offer them a discount on future work for a quote).

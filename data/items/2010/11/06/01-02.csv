1875612,comment,1875014,1875181,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"And journalism is all about getting eyeballs, even if that compromises accuracy in the process. What we have here is an abridgment Current.TV 'reprint' of a London Times article that doesn't cite any specific papers, and which contains a great deal more hand-waving than specifics. It's so poorly edited that the Current.TV version never identifies who this 'Marino' person is (the Times does: Lori Marino, a zoologist from Emory U., GA). So already you're forming conclusions based on significantly incomplete information.<p>Moving onto the Times article, it too fails to differentiate clearly between the findings of two scientists (Marino & Reiss), specializing in the study of dolphins, and a professor of ethics (White) offering a view on the implications of the scientific findings. Agree or disagree with his conclusion, offering opinions on ethical matters is the sort of thing ethicists are employed to do. What's not clear is the degree of advocacy taking place, or who is doing it.<p>If Marino and Reiss simply offer their findings about the neurology and observable behavior of dolphins, and observe that this allows us to make some inferences about how intelligent they are in human terms using rigorous methods, that's not advocacy of the kind you object to: that'd just good old empiricism. To the extent that there's an agenda in the choice of subject, it's one of increasing scientific knowledge. No scientists needs permission for the curiosity. How about White? Perhaps his abridged quote about delphine moral qualifications is advocacy, or perhaps it's the conclusion he's drawn after evaluating the accuracy of the scientific findings and placing them in a formal ethical framework of the kind we use to explore other ethical questions and inform policy. One doesn't have to agree with an ethicist's conclusion, but we must at least admit that someone whose job it is to teach moral reasoning is entitled to apply their skills and form an opinion.<p>It seems to me that you've decided to take the headline literally and attribute the apparent conclusion of the ethics professor to the psychologist and zoologist, and then condemn <i>them</i> for unscientific irresponsibility.<p>There are two flaws with this approach. The obvious one is the inaccuracy of judging someone by the actions or statements of another. The less obvious one - even if the advocacy is expressed by the scientists themselves - is the assumption that they are claiming scientific authority for something they might advocate. It is not wrong for scientists to have opinions on non-scientific topics like ethics, or to express those opinions in public. It's only wrong for a scientist to assert a scientific basis for an unscientific opinion by leveraging their academic authority.<p>For example, a biologist can observe that a human breathing x amount of carbon monoxide is likely to be fatal; this we are willing to treat as a fact based on academic credibility. The same biologist might also opine that killing people by suffocating them with carbon monoxide is immoral; here, academic standing confers no more moral authority than you or I enjoy, but nor does it imply any <i>less</i>. Moral hazard is when the biologist says 'my expertise on the biological effects of carbon monoxide gives me superior powers of moral judgment.' That's flat-out dishonest, and if a scientist employs a technical journal as a platform for their moral beliefs, I quite agree that it's unscientific. But if they want to present their moral beliefs in the <i>Journal of Moral Philosophy</i>, that doesn't bother me at all because I can judge their argument from its proper perspective, and evaluate whether the moral reasoning they employ justifies the conclusions they draw. Nor would I have a problem with an ethicist submitting a paper to the <i>Journal of Morally Neutral Psychology</i> if it were presenting rigorous empirical observations and statistical methods that were strictly limited to describing people's behavior. In short, it is the context in which activism takes place that matters when judging its professionalism - if any activism has taken place at all.<p>So, I did some research into the background. It turns out that the context in which these academics talked about dolphins was (drumroll, please) at a symposium on titled 'Intelligence in Dolphins: Ethical and Policy Implications' during the annual conference of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Marino presented anatomical findings about the anatomical evidence used to evaluate the intelligence and wellbeing of dolphins, and whether measurable declines in wellbeing could result from conditions of captivity. Reiss reviewed her work on the cognitive and social psychology of dolphins, and asked whether scientists can or should seek to export existing ethical practices governing scientific research and treatment of livestock in the US to other nations who are indifferent to such ethical standards. White examined the ethical implications of these and other questions, seemingly concluding that despite fundamental differences, the basis on which we accord moral standing to humans also seems to apply to dolphins.<p>I don't know the details of what they said; I'm going by the abstracts for the symposium listed on the conference schedule, which seems to be the entire basis for the Times article as well. These are available at <a href=""http://aaas.confex.com/aaas/2010/webprogram/Session1526.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aaas.confex.com/aaas/2010/webprogram/Session1526.html</a><p>But what I do know, now, is that these three individuals were not attempting to persuade or even address the public, but were discussing the ethical quandaries encountered within their profession, in front of an audience of other scientists at a professional conference.<p>Is this OK, or you still have a problem with it? If so, could you explain how it differs from discussions of medical or legal ethics among members of those professions?",1289007296

We decided to try out the idea of a merger, since pylons-trunk for Pylons 2 was doing little more than minor extensions of repoze.bfg anyways, which was collapsed into the pyramid code-base (and is a distinction in that respect from repoze.bfg which doesn't have those bits).<p>It worked out quite well from some attempts at 'trying it out' and the news of this leaked quite a bit earlier than we anticipated making it hard to try and put together what I think could've been a better process.<p>Was there a discussion where we asked everyone in both communities for their input on merging? Not really, we talked to primary contributors and developers who had worked on each stack to try and solicit input and ensure they were all in favor of it. But yes, I agree entirely that I <i>should've solicited feedback from the pylons community at large</i>.<p>For pylons the code-base, there really isn't going to be any difference from what there is right now, and has been. A maintained, stable, mature code-base, that has hit a point where there's little more to be done with it. It's been at a feature-standstill for about 2+ years now. It's <i>not going away, and it will still be maintained</i>.<p>So I think the way the merger was done definitely could've been announced differently, with more emphasis on what it meant for the pylons code-base (nothing really), vs. the continuing development efforts of myself and other pylons developers.<p>- Ben",1289007269

The new API does allow you to search the entire web and is near identical to the old which is good, but has the 100 queries/day limitation. This is bad and a show-stopper for a lot of people.<p>Here's what I've learned:<p>1. You can request more units but no one has responded to me in any way since Nov. 1.<p>2. The form to request a higher quota asks you if you're a Google Site Search customer. That makes me think that it may make a difference to be a customer of a paid service they have. \n(FYI: Google Site Search is apparently a different name for Enterprise Custom Search which I'm hoping is the same technology as CSE and will allow you to search the web.)<p>3. If you want to BUY the super high volume Site Search service as we are willing to do, you have to communicate with the Sales team, but no one has responded to us on that request either.<p>4. Another interesting approach that I'll try soon is this: CSE gives you the API to actually create a custom search engine on the fly. But this requires separate Google logins and some work in implementing the ClientLogin authentication business. At the end, you're still limited to 100 queries/day but at least it is ""per client"".<p>I hope someone from Google is reading this and can shed some light on the issue.",1289006557

I say that this isn't realistically possible.<p>This works for people you know (easily, they can grok what you wanted to say). It might work for peers (they understand where you coming from, share some experiences and might know what you want to get at).\nIn general, it doesn't work at all.<p>Things you completely ignore:<p>- Language:\nMy first post started with the difference between reading in your native language and a foreign one. Depending on your readers understanding of your language you cannot transport your intentions in a reliable way. A smile, on the other hand, goes a long way to show that you are not actually mocking him/her and are a friendly person.\nGood luck, trying to make that universal.<p>- Feedback\nYou can write a loooong text about a subject and cause me to explode when I read that midway through. If you tell me the same story face to face, you could probably read my expressions (depending again on context, how familiar we are, if you pay attention etc.) and navigate around some hurdles. You really want to tell a nice story about the Iraq war but notice how my mood turned darker? Good chance to ask me about my opinion and to take it slowly. How do you solve that in a text based conversation? Right.<p>- Context/Previous knowledge:\nYou can talk about things I have no clue about, rather easily. Depending on your attitude and style of writing I might feel excluded, maybe offended, although it's entirely my fault. Face to face you could be Prince Charming. Without that and any knowledge of your readers schooling/education/knowledge, how are you going to make sure that you don't accidently embarass them?<p>I don't blame email or technology. The problem isn't new either. As long as we've been able to communicate in writing first, without knowing the other person, this problem existed. It's not about ""emails"". Neither about ""technology sucks"". It's about ""words, without more context (previous encounters, a similar character, a shared history), don't carry the full information"".<p>For me it's like a blurred image. If I know the thing that is depicted, I can clearly recognize it. If not, it's guesswork. You can try and make it easier, by blowing up your text to explain as much as possible and to try to (and fail) solve any ambiguous meaning, but in the end I'm still lost. On the recipients end, I have to rely on my information alone to understand what information you want to provide.<p>I have some good friends that are blind. In your world, they wouldn't miss that much even outside of online conversations: The text carries all the meaning, right? Nuances of the voice? Nice, but not necessary if the author is disciplined. Making faces, smiling etc.? Hey, you don't need that.<p>Are you really, really serious?<p>And you say ""you have to learn how to write"", when I say that reading is the part where the problem occurs? Can you really write ""for everyone""? I'd argue that so far you cannot write for me, I'm still unsure if you are just trying to contine this discussion in a productive way (hints are some writing related parts of the comment, imo) or if you just want to talk me down (most of the comment, imo).<p>See 1, 2 and 3 and check if you actually _can_ write clear enough for everybody out there.<p>(FWIW: I used ""me"" and ""I"" in this text as a general replacement for ""you"" and ""one"", i.e. just examples.

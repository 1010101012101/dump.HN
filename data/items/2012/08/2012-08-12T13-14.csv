4372535,comment,4371267,4372405,1,0,stan_rogers,,,"I'll take a stab at it. (That is to say, ""I <i>think</i> I understand how the phrase is being used, at least to a degree that it makes perfect sense to me. I may, of course, be wrong. But I'll try to translate my understanding."")<p>At any level above the trivial, the code we write (or work with) is very often <i>not</i> a direct set of instructions for the machine to carry out. Here, I don't simply mean <i>a high-level language is not machine code or assembly</i>. I think it's safe to assume that we all get that much at least.<p>Rather, it's a lot like everyday conversation, but with Lewis Carrol's Humpty Dumpty character. There will be common (and less-than-common) cultural references, along with a whole bunch of private definitions for things. Actually understanding the conversation means not only having those cultural references in common[1], but also having access to the private definitions[2] (such as ""glory"" meaning ""a nice knock-down argument"").<p>So the text on the screen (or in the file) is not the actual code, or even a complete description of the code, that the machine will run. It's only a sort of short-hand representation, a language we created along the way to talk about the instructions (even if, at the basic level of the language facilities, the operators and keywords are directly translatable). Simply working with the text content, then, as one would do with a simple parser, or as a human programmer would do with a single text file in isolation, is insufficient; the person or tool would have to have a much deeper understanding of the implications of the text in order to make any real sense of it.[3] For a tool to offer useful help (beyond the simple matter of altering text), it has to be able to ""understand"" what the text means, and that , in turn, means looking beyond the simple arrangement of text characters.<p>[1] It might help to think about the <i>Darmok</i> episode of Start Trek TNG. Library calls are very much like the metaphorical language of the Tamarians, in that they make perfect sense if we know the ""story"" being referenced, but not knowing means either the reference is meaningless or can even be misleading.<p>[2] That applies as much to preprocessing directives like constant definitions as it does to things like function/method calls.<p>[3] We do this is natural languages as well. Every time you've run across a cant, an argot or a jargon specific to one field of endeavor, you either understand it because you are familiar with the displaced vocabulary, or you're left in that uncomfortable state of knowing (or thinking you know) what most of the <i>words</i> mean, but failing entirely to understand what's being said.",1344779833

pseudo-argument in discussions like this. It has no merit and can be dismissed
as such.<p>[1]: I've made this point countless times in the past, in all sorts of different

For example, if you've generated 2^64 hashes, you have a 1/2^33 chance of collision.  This works pretty well until you get too close to 2^80, and larger.<p>Edit: That formula actually is a shorthand for (n * (n-1)/2) / 2^160, you get it because on your first hash, you have 0/2^160 chance of collision, and on your second hash, you have 1/2^160 chance of collision, and on your third, you have 2/2^160 chance of collision, and on your nth, you have (n-1)/2^160 chance of collision (assuming you haven't had any collisions already).  So you can add up those probabilities to get (n * (n-1)/2)/2^160 -- you can just add the probabilities because the chance of having _two_ collisions is super unlikely (until it is no longer super unlikely, around 2^80 or so).  (Really it's 1 - (1 - 1 / 2^160)^k and we're approximating that with k * (1 / 2^160.)",1344776972

If you cannot handle the responsibility you have as a vendor, then don't be one.<p>> Does Microsoft have to pay out on a claim when damage is caused because a certificate is forged by the US government?<p>No, because Microsoft's stuff works as intended in that case, the CA should be held liable.",1344776622

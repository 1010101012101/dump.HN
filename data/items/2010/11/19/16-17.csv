Queue up uploads so that users don't start uploading until the server(s) can take them.<p>3. Delay any processing of the uploaded files.<p>4. Throw some more cheap servers, additional VMs at the problem, or more dynos/workers if using Heroku, etc.<p>5. Ensure your pipes are large enough.<p>6.

I was in a group of about 12 students. One of them whose username was robert set his password to robert (a brilliant move).<p>We only realized the machine was compromised because the interloper decided to pick two user accounts at random and delete them (another brilliant move).<p>Upon investigation I found that a keylogger had been installed in order to discover the root password. I inspected the output of the keylogger to trace the attacker's steps. Similar to the SSH scan in the article, the attacker had logged into his own FTP server to download various scripts and crackers. Well, the keylogger had logged his FTP password as well (whoops).

I've had colleagues who alt-tab A LOT.  Basically, 15 minutes in the IDE, tab out, 5 minutes of chatting.  15 minutes back to the IDE, 5 minutes back to browsing.  For a 8 hour day, that's 75% of the time working.  Good right?  NO.<p>Context switching is expensive.  A large part of the 15 minutes of work in the IDE is resetting the frame of mind to work.<p>Now why do people context switch.  Simple.  Micro-management from project managers, team leaders, bosses ...<p>If I, as a team leader, look over at your screen and see you surfing the net for 1 full hour, I'll get pissed.  But if you alt-tab a lot, there is a good chance when I'm spying over your shoulder, you're on the IDE.  Good worker!<p>I hate it.  Which is why when I had my own team, I told my guys, you want to surf, sure, spend as long as you want.  But when you code, focus on the coding for a full X amount of time.  So, I tell them, you want a break, surf for 30 minutes.  But make sure you get full one and a half hours of coding done first.  Plan what you need to do, tell the team what you aim to achieve, and do it.<p>I also find that when people don't need to pretend to work, and can rest in peace chatting, surfing, they tend to be less stress.<p>Another example, sleeping in the office is a big no-no.  So what do people do?  They run off to the stairs to sleep.  Or to the toilet.  Ridiculous.  If my guy has been pulling all nighters, I think it is perfectly fine for him to rest his head on the desk for a while.",1290185688

It could be argued that unhappiness drives innovation, productivity and progress, in much the same way profit motive does.<p>My desire to be a productive person stems from my experiences with short term happiness. No matter how many movies, video games or hobbies I enjoy in the short term, I will eventually feel a lack of deeper fulfillment if I don't accomplish something significant.<p>The happiness offered by the system in BNW seems to provide only this fleeting happiness without addressing the longer term ""contented"" style of happiness. I think this is what people react negatively to. It is hard to imagine a ""cheat"" to fulfillment because so many people spend their lives searching for it unsuccessfully.<p>The characters in BNW have apparently been modified or conditioned to lack this drive.

The problem of commuting is related to the fact that majority of commuting is synchronized to within 2 ~2-3 hour periods. As long as we have this happening, the 'naive' argument is that commuting actually argues for longer work days with less days of work. 4x10 or something, so the travel:work ratio is better.<p>Even a more flexible work schedule (for everyone) is not necessarily the solution. The fact that most people will be working during the day will mean that there will always been surges ~8-10 and ~4-6. It might lessen it's effect, but it'll still be there, and after the initial adjustment period, will seem every bit as unproductive and annoying.<p>Commuting isn't going to get better unless a very large percentage switches to work at home, or lives within walking/biking distance of their workplace, or everyone accepts some great overlord who coordinates everyone's travel and work time to minimize peak traffic (I'm sure the relevant algorithms already exist).",1290184564

I would hate to edit icons that are a mish-mash of CSS backgrounds, rotated boxes, and border-radius'ed edges, and to boot, based entirely on pseudo-elements.  (Current web dev tools like Web Inspector in Chrome/Safari, etc. aren't well built for examining pseudo-elements.)  This CSS uses ~3-4 pseudo-elements per icon.  It's clever for doing that to preserve the markup and avoiding JS, but it's hard to understand.  Maybe it would help to comment the CSS so designers can see that ""this is the handle of the trash can, this is the left side of the heart,"" etc., since :after and :before are hacked far beyond having any semantic meaning.",1290183390

But do you believe status is not a factor in the eyes of most girls (this is, of course, simply a generalization)?<p>I'm sure you have friends who you would consider incredibly nice, but very shy, guys who never could get a girlfriend, and plenty of jerky, but confident, guys who you wonder why girls would date. Confident guys, even when not nice, just seem to win out over really nice, but not at all confident, guys. Guys with both win out over both.

569782,comment,569103,569630,0,0,DenisM,,,"I expect ""no human drivers permitted on public roads"" to be the law because human drivers are fallible. Robots are also fallible, but they tend to accumulate their lessons across entire robot population (at least within one manufacturing company) whereas each new human driver needs to be taught anew. Even well-taught, humans are still prone to errors and it's only a matter of time before standard robot is 10 times safer than 95th percentile of drivers.<p>The only problem with robots is systemic risk - some sort of common bug (e.g. Y2K) that would take out many machines at once or another thing that fails in a non-graceful manner. Car companies are not strangers to designing proper failure modes so I think it will pan out ok in the end, but software engineers aren't as good at it yet so we do have that risk for a while.",1240174053

He had an amazing hack/DIY ethic then, and clearly still does - I'm very impressed with what he's achieved.<p>But as you can see from the RepRap homepage, funding comes from donations, t-shirts and kit sales. Ideologically pure DIY is laudable but we've all seen software projects that were a triumph of individual achievement and a true labor of love, but where v1.0 finally landed with an interface that was >5 years out of date.<p>The problem at bottom is that RepRap can't do things on a very fine scale, and you can't build a new RepRap from an existing one - you can make bits, but not the motors or the extruder, which are exactly the (relatively) expensive and hard-to-source parts in shortest supply in places like Africa.<p>Given the increasing quality and affordability of commercial RP and 3d printing machines, it might make a lot more sense to raise a few hundred k or a few million in capital, buy the good commercial stuff, and skip several generations, just as the OLPC was (presumably) designed on the most up-to-date computers available, rather than being bootstrapped on 8086 machines for reasons of ideological purity.<p>Reprap is a great venture, but it's never going to get there by itself, and the founders are never going to dirty themselves asking for a big check in exchange for any kind of commercial license.

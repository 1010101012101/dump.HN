I think there is a general bias towards multi-founder teams bc of bandwidth, skill set, and emotional support. However the principles of fundraising remain the same for 1 or 2 founders - belief in the founder/story, big space, and social proof. I had a co-founder for my previous company and we weren&#x27;t able to raise money, because we didn&#x27;t have the basics of fundraising down.<p>Take away: Fundraising is less about how many founders you have and more about knowing how to do it. I&#x27;m happy sharing more if anyone is interested.",1407207546

8135310,comment,8134246,8134973,8,0,userbinator,,,"The important thing to keep in mind is that the Chinese do not aim to copy complete designs - they reproduce the aspects that they like, omit what they don&#x27;t, and then improve upon them with what consumers want. It&#x27;s a very practical and pragmatic way to innovate. A lot of Chinese like the &quot;Apple style&quot;, in terms of appearance, but not the price nor lock-in. This is why cloners have been successful in producing iPhone-lookalikes with removable batteries, dual SIM, expandable storage, larger displays, microUSB, and Android (look at e.g. the Jiayu G5) - the users are not after the complete Apple experience, they just want something that looks like an iPhone with all the standard features found on many other handsets that a real iPhone doesn&#x27;t have.<p>Also, the concept of vendor lock-in doesn&#x27;t take hold as easily in a culture where copying is the norm - attempts to create new, incompatible proprietary standards will either fail if there is no significant advantage (the users will just avoid your product), or if there is a clear advantage, everyone else will soon have copied it. Some will say this limits innovation but I see it more as innovation happening slowly and more naturally to meet user&#x27;s needs, as opposed to being forced.",1407207475

There are a lot of admins out there, regardless of OS expertise, who&#x27;ve never heard of it full stop. I learned about it whilst working as a developer in the banking sector 12 years ago but using eye-wateringly expensive tooling from the likes of IBM and CA.<p>We have a 65/35 Windows/Linux environment, I have for years wanted to &quot;CM-ize&quot; our environments but we have two different silos of scripts and tomfoolery that get stuff done, we have a lot of friction points because of this. But one of the problems with CM tooling such as Chef, Puppet, Ansible and Salt has been the lack of sane support for Windows. Puppet seems to be getting better at it compared to the other three contenders. For example handling reboots sensibly [0] (and you know how Windows loves its reboots, and in the right order after some MSI or MSU has executed).<p>There is also a somewhat blinkered world view with regards to Windows i.e. &quot;yuk, windows, not touching that&quot;, and at the risk of offending some, it&#x27;s snobbery and cargo-cultism. A lot of the young folks around here have probably never tried modern Windows server management, it ain&#x27;t that bad these days. If you can be bothered to learn bash and all this clever stuff on Unix, you can get a handle on learning Windows config management with Powershell which is very bloody good now.<p>The result is that we have silos of C/VBscript and Powershell code that go and built Windows environments in their own special Windows way because previously tools such as Chef, Ansible et al and their respective development teams don&#x27;t (rightly but mostly wrongly) don&#x27;t see any value in Windows support.<p>I speak as a platform agnostic devops person who has to live in both worlds and has supported Windows and Linux/Unix for longer than most of you have been alive :)<p>[0]: <a href=""https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/reboot"" rel=""nofollow"">https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/reboot</a>",1407207448

I&#x27;ve settled into wrapping all queries in classes, with any parameters exposed as public properties.  The SQL is written inside the class, essentially in a template.  When necessary, the generated query can change based on the values assigned to the properties.  All the mechanics of how the query is executed and passed to the database get rolled up in the base class, with a public method that returns the dataset returned by execution.  Then I just run the dataset through transformation functions to get the data structures I actually need - combining multiple result sets if necessary to build really complicated objects when I have to.<p>I&#x27;ve been building this approach for a couple years now, and  I haven&#x27;t regretted it for a minute.  I don&#x27;t have to fit my databases to the vagaries of the ORM layer, and I have full control over my queries.  I NEVER want to go back to ORM :)",1407207071

Bay Area cities are now constrained by urban growth boundaries and required to provide jobs and housing in proportion, not just one or the other.<p>Unfortunately if you take the entire Bay Area as a whole, proper urban structure with walkable mixed use takes up perhaps 1% or less of the developed area.  Everything else is sprawl.  Even in the city of SF itself less than 1/3rd of the built area (not counting parks and lakes and whatnot) is decent walk/bike territory with amenities nearby.  And you only have to go as far as Concord or Antioch to find the real deal: all-out suburban sprawl with neighborhood streets wider than I-5 and nary a pedestrian in sight.<p>Now when you compare to Oklahoma City, the Antioch brand of sprawl looks like it might be Hong Kong compared to some of the developments that are within the OKC&#x27;s limits.

When you do writes you want transactions and 3rd normal form but when reporting 3rd normal form becomes a downside. This applies to attribute creep and data retrieval.<p>Second the dual schema problem is one that I think most ORM users know how to avoid. I generate the schema from the code directly, maybe with a little bit of fluent migrations to help move data.<p>The issue with transactions is a strange one. Ideally this is handled as a cross cutting concern in your application. This means it&#x27;s consistent and transactions can be explicit and predictable. I&#x27;d do the same thing for any application.<p>The biggest issue here is I think the author has chosen the wrong tool. This application sounds like it would be well suited for event sourcing.

For instance, I know Uber exists, but since I only take taxi occasionally I don&#x27;t own an Uber account.<p>In NY, the Chinese and the Korean community have their own network knowing how to reach the Chinese/Korean-speaking car service and shuttle service. Uber or alike cannot beat this system. These locale-specific service operate with just telephone. Very school but effective! No app, no Internet access. Pretty reliable and cheap.<p>So all he need to do is to find a community to target at and find drivers willing to join him.",1407204557

The chief issues with these tools on Windows are package management, overall speed, and community focus on not-Windows.<p>Package management is the worst, IMO, and it stems from Windows and the majority of it&#x27;s &#x27;software universe&#x27; being commercial. Software is expected to install on many editions of Windows; it is not common to see edition-specific packages for anything not otherwise edition-specific. Software can be packaged and installed many different ways, some of which do not support unattended installation. It&#x27;s not always clear whether a package is installed at all. It&#x27;s usually difficult to repackage software that doesn&#x27;t work the way you want it to, and even if it&#x27;s easy to do you probably can&#x27;t redistribute the result.<p>So yeah, in general, package management is the ugly.",1407204459

If copy is a way to catch up and serve as the basis for evolving one‘s own true strengths (well, true strength here makes the difference), it&#x27;s definitely a good thing. If copy only brings almost brain-dead repetition, even others can not stop it, it will implode in the end.<p>Sorry to reply with such an abstract content. There are just too many things in my mind to say. So I try to provide some general ideas instead of be very specific.

When we talk about culture, we just has to accept the symptom of one organization as is. Hence, it brings us not much information.

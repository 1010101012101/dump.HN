My city (DC) has a thriving subreddit that meets up probably 2-3 times a week officially to do things - zombie invasion simulations, drinking, board games, go karting, etc.  It's been a fantastic way to just get out and do stuff with people.  There is a whole subreddit dedicated to 'Barcraft' which brings watching pro starcraft live to bars (like you would watch any other sport).  People are spending their time to put on these live events with help from companies like Justin.tv/Twitch.  Those are two examples that hit home close to me, but I am sure you can find stuff for you as well, you just have to look and engage with the proper communities.",1314399573

If you haven't used Flash lately, I encourage you to read the API docs for Flex and have a play around with the Free compiler. It's become very easy to mix standards-compliant markup and Flash in a manner which degrades gracefully/enhances progressively.<p>IMO, the problem is developers. Because of Flash's origins as a tool for designers to make animations, most ActionScript is atrociously bad. The lion's share of Flash is created by people who really don't know how to program. When you have a community where knowing what recursion is marks you out as above-average, it's understandable that the core technology gets a bad rep. The problem is self-reinforcing, as good developers want to use the new shiny HTML5 and don't want to tarnish their CV with Flash development.<p>A huge spectrum of really high-quality web apps are reliant on Flash. Streaming video is the obvious application, but projects like SoundManager2 are still reliant on Flash for audio in HTML5 apps. It's a very nineties word, but Flash is still the bottom line when it comes to multimedia. Products like Google Street View or Turntable.fm just aren't plausible without Flash and won't be for the forseeable future. Given the glacial pace of the W3C on HTML5 and the likely slow uptake of newer browsers, we're stuck with it. I don't see that as a wholly bad thing.",1314398909

Post-funding there are many more mechanisms for getting the word out about how awesome you are, but before that event happens there's nothing better than a little free advertising from a major tech blog.<p>And in the end the coverage has helped us become a better company.  We have many many more users now than we did before the feature, and the exposure helped us gain quite a few ""champion"" users whose feedback has been invaluable to us as our product evolves.<p>Key thing for us was to make sure it was stated explicitly that we were pretty brand new.

When you're not getting any, it can feel like the best thing in the world would be to become a Brad Pitt lookalike so you could have your pick and go out on some huge bacchanalic binge, but there's a reason a guy like Brad doesn't spend much of his time doing that sort of thing--it isn't all that satisfying or fulfilling.<p>In reality, once you are able to reach a base level of intimacy and satisfaction in one (or multiple) sexual relationship(s), how others perceive your looks in general stops mattering almost completely, and the fortunate truth is that achieving this satisfied state doesn't really require being some sort of Casanova, just moderately socially active, comfortable with yourself, and willing to put yourself out there occasionally. It may be slightly easier to be happy in this aspect of life as a very attractive person, but in the whole scheme of what it takes to be fulfilled, it's a fairly small advantage really.",1314397563

They're explicitly trying to distract you from what you're doing. Search ads augment your search and harness your intent. Google gives you things you might actually be looking for when you're looking for it.[1]<p>And also, I don't think social search is as important as people think. The whole point of harnessing the power of the entire web for search results is getting stuff that we didn't have access to before the internet. I've always been able to ask my friends their opinion. The web lets me ask experts on the specific subject at hand.<p>Why <i>wouldn't</i> FB want to do this? Because FB doesn't really want to send people away. They never have. Everything they do is designed to keep you on the site, and their external stuff is designed to draw you in.<p>Also, it's super hard (which the post does mention).

That is, the field of a spherically symmetric object is the same as the field of a point mass of its mass located at its center.<p>As soon as your test object is non-point you get tidal forces due to the field typically being nonuniform.  As soon as your object is not spherically symmetric you get a field that looks nothing like that of a point mass.",1314396287

The competition to be ""THE"" way people play media was very intense between Real, Microsoft, and Apple.

Specifically, for people where mobility is more important than power, but able to get actual work done.<p>I bought one when I was hauling around my ThinkPad to school, work, coffeeshops, and everywhere else around the city. Since I didn't have a car, it meant it was one my shoulders the whole time. I considered getting a netbook, but after using a friend's for a little while, I realized it wasn't going to work (tiny keyboard, not enough power.)<p>The Air, on the other hand, has a full-size keyboard. I don't remember what the processor is, but it was more powerful than an Atom. RAM was short but you can survive.<p>I used it for primarily writing my thesis, making presentations,  coding in TextMate, and work in Matlab. I didn't need power, and I definitely didn't want weight. That was lighter and easier to hold than a textbook, and could actually perform the duties I needed to.<p>So, regardless of what you'd like to think, there is a market for them outside of people who want shiny things.",1314396067

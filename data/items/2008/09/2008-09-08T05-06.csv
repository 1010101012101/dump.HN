They have only been in office since 2007. They are ~50-55 members short of a veto-proof majority.<p>Democrats have tried mightily with what they have.  Bush vetoed [via Wikipedia]:<p>1. July 19, 2006: Vetoed H.R. 810, Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005, a bill to ease restrictions on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. Override attempt failed in House, 235-193 (286 needed).<p>2. May 1, 2007: Vetoed H.R. 1591, U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007. Override attempt failed in House, 222-203 (284 needed). A later version of the bill that excluded certain aspects of the initial legislation that the President disapproved of, H.R. 2206, was enacted as Pub.L. 110-28 with the President's approval.<p>3. June 20, 2007: Vetoed S. 5, Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007.<p>4. October 3, 2007: Vetoed H.R. 976, Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (""SCHIP""). Override attempt failed in House, 273-156 (286 votes needed).<p>5. November 2, 2007: Vetoed H.R. 1495, Water Resources Development Act of 2007. Overridden by House, 361-54 (277 votes needed). Overridden by Senate, 79-14 (62 needed), and enacted as Pub.L. 110-114 over President's veto.<p>6. November 13, 2007: Vetoed H.R. 3043, Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2008. Override attempt failed in House, 277-141 (279 votes needed).<p>7. December 12, 2007: Vetoed H.R. 3963, Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007.[18] Override attempt failed in House, 260-152 (275 votes needed).<p>8. December 28, 2007: Pocket Vetoed H.R. 1585, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008[19]. A later version of the bill that changed a minor provision of which the President disapproved was quickly passed by Congress (H.R. 4986) and was enacted with the President's approval as Pub.L. 110-181 on 28 January 2008.<p>9. March 8, 2008: Vetoed H.R. 2082, Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008.[20][21] Override attempt failed in House, 225-188.<p>10. May 21, 2008: Vetoed H.R. 2419, 2007 U.S. Farm Bill.[22][23] Overridden by House, 316-108 (283 votes needed). Overridden by Senate, 82-13 (64 votes needed). Enacted as Pub.L. 110-234 over the President's veto. Due to a clerical error, this act was repealed by Pub.L. 110-246.<p>11. 18 June 2008: Vetoed H.R. 6421, 2007 U.S. Farm Bill, re-passed by Congress to correct a clerical error in HR 2419.[24] Overridden by House, 317-109 (284 votes required).

I just made an account, and I think that shring time lines is really a good way to talk and exchange a lot. I truly think people will meet through these things. it's a social network that's surely more meaninful than myspace or facebook, cause it's made to exacge information (in a pretty user friendly way). it's sharing information instead or pure fame or coolness (or throwing pies and presents).<p>add me I'm ""smoothboom"" and I just started a time line about memetics if you're interested.",1220853272

298035,comment,297593,297744,0,0,albertcardona,,,"In Spain, during the 1950's and even later, there were situations of semi-slavery that run like the following: landlord provided housing and food, and didn't charge the worker for anything until the end of the year, after the harvest. Then, the landlord would always find the worker living costs had totaled slightly more than what he had earned working for him, and thus the worker <i>had</i> to stay another year ... and the ghastly cycle would renew itself. The landlord would even have armed guards to ""protect"" the ""village"", and would not let anyone leave for their ""protection"", soviet style. Those bright enough had to run away in the middle of the night.<p>[EDIT: bottom line: don't lose track of what you really earn and what you really spend.]",1220852592

There is also the lack of iPhone push.<p>I've tried forwarding, but it quickly ends up being a mess of mails everywhere - or I simply lack the system to keep it tidy.<p>In all cases I end up with multiple Junk mail folders that I need to manually check occasionally.<p>I won't even get onto Calendars, because that's even more of a mess.

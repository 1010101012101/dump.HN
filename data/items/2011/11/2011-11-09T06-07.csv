It does suck, in a million ways, reflecting our society at large rather well, overall.

For all that people complain about Flash, and any problems the Flash Player runtime has, it's really a fun environment to code for.

3214573,comment,3213599,3214338,18,0,pak,,,"I think you're missing his bigger insight, that is, building a social graph is a fundamentally asocial act.  And that extends to creating taxonomies, even if they are localized to my concept of socializing.  Nobody goes to a party to create a taxonomy.<p>Being social is all about disorganization, spontaneity, creativity, breaking <i>out</i> of all the stupid taxonomies that we impose on other people and have imposed on us.  Trying to organize socialization to the extent that a ""social graph"" can be created is a profoundly sociopathic act.  To push this task on users so that they do all the shoeboxing and tagging and linking, all in the name of ""fun,"" requires some coercive force.  It is no surprise that many Facebook users say that they don't really <i>enjoy</i> using it, but they <i>have</i> to.  Part of that was the site's smart choice to maintain real names, so that you are always fretting about your online appearance.  It's not a ""perfectly synced representation of reality,"" but it is presented as such, almost like your own personal Wikipedia page, and by the laws of social anxiety you are compelled to check up on it!  Shoebox, tag, link...<p>The line about Facebook rarely producing creative or original material really hit home for me.  4chan and SA are creative because they are fundamentally disorganized, and this freedom produces real moments of brilliance (and plenty more of profound stupidity).  Facebook and its ilk are like corporate jobs disguised as consumer web products.  You are constantly being shuffled from box to box, task to task, and the blinders have to be tightened ever so constantly to keep you from realizing why what you are doing really never will be ""fun"" in the way that a raucous party is fun.<p>About those blinders: those are in a big way the ""privacy options"" that every social network touts.  Maciej points out, and I think that it's a salient point, that if everybody was able to see the whole social graph, it would dissolve.  That alone should suggest that the social graph is an unnatural concept.  Yet there is somebody, the owner of the social network, that can indeed see the entire graph, and there is a whole level of misdirection that they must apply to make this seem completely normal.<p>Again, maciej said most of this better than I could, so I'm glad he did.",1320821449

Users know this and expect Flash to work. It works, sortof, on the default browser. It didn't work for the longest time on Opera and Firefox Mobile. Opera now supports it somewhat reasonably (presumable due to a truly herculean effort of their developers to figure out the real API without any meaningful Adobe support), and Firefox Mobile barely in some of the latest Nightlies. Especially due the latter adding support (for a non-open standard!), I think it's a clear illustration that the feature is considered a must have if you want to have significant user penetration on Android.<p>Consider also how much effort Google is putting into helping Adobe make Flash more secure. Think about why they bother.<p>The problem is that Flash websites are out there. The investment has been thrown into the black hole. People who payed for these sites are going to sit on them for a while.

3214546,comment,3214517,3214517,12,0,tokenadult,,,"It looks like this newly submitted article is reasonably thoughtful and informed. The distinction between job categories vulnerable to globalization and those less vulnerable is interesting, and points out that some college-degree-requiring jobs may be increasingly outsourced.<p>But degree-seekers decide whether or not to get degrees at the individual level, and sometimes after already deciding on a career. I've not posted in some of the other recent threads about the supposed uselessness of college degrees, and I want to provide a different perspective on the issue. While reading about IQ testing research, specifically directed to the issue of IQ tests as qualifications for being hired for full-time employment, I saw the striking statement that at ALL levels of IQ, an engineer will enjoy better career prospects than a technician. In many business corporations and government agencies (perhaps there are some exceptions), the distinction between being hired as a ""technician"" and being hired as an ""engineer"" is mostly determined by the absence or presence of a college degree. The lifetime earnings difference (remember, this is for persons with the same IQ) between a technician and an engineer is more than enough to justify investing in getting a college degree in engineering.<p>I do not claim this generalizes to the difference between an ""office assistant"" and an ""office manager"" (which perhaps is also defined mostly by higher education credentials) but that would be an empirical issue to look at. If college study has signaling value in the job market, and perhaps also provides some practical training for being in one job category rather than another, whoever you are, however smart you are, you may be well advised to seek a college degree.<p>For the more college-skeptical view of Charles Murray, see ""Down with the Four-Year College Degree!"":<p><a href=""http://www.cato-unbound.org/2008/10/06/charles-murray/down-with-the-four-year-college-degree/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cato-unbound.org/2008/10/06/charles-murray/down-w...</a>",1320820595

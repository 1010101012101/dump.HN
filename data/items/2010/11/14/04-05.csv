1902565,comment,1901972,1901972,0,0,ghshephard,,,"From the article: ""efficient remoting protocols do not look like X""<p>I'll attest to that.  Back in 1999/2000 when I had to administer a 500-700 element network using HPopenView over a 128 Kbit ISDN link, the performance was ""OK"", but nothing to write home about.  If I had a lot of work to do, I was often tempted to just head into the office, and work there.<p>Then, Windows XP+Remote Desktop came in vogue, and the combination of Windows XP running the HummingBird Client (Exceed was the common X-Server at the time), accessed via RDP over ISDN, was actually a very successful combination.<p>Net-Net - While everyone talks about how great X-Windows is from a network-transparency perspective, I've always had more success with RDP - to the point of running it on my iPhone/iPad to manage my desktop at work.  I'm not even sure if they make an X-Server for the iPhone. (Edit: of course they do - <a href=""http://www.appstorehq.com/ix11-xserver-iphone-32068/app"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appstorehq.com/ix11-xserver-iphone-32068/app</a>)<p>And VNC is just plain great as well - lots of competition in that ecosystem, and is hands down the most elegant solution to manage a couple dozen desktops running in VMware workstation for Windows.<p>So - Given that X-Windows has always been a bit ""kludgy"" for Desktop Apps (And I speak as one who has been using them for well over 10 years, sometimes on a daily basis for years at a stretch), and has never really been that super as a remote-access mechanism, has likely held back the adoption of Linux as a Desktop OS, AND will also likely be still supported even as Wayland starts to come on board - I say this is a GREAT announcement, and look forward to the community coming onboard and developing the Wayland ecosystem.",1289710282

Most of the comments here are focusing on fundamental investing which has a very longterm view.......benjamin graham's book is a good starting point here. Since this is hacker news, i would recommend you focus on ignoring fundamental data and focus purely on statistical analyses, thereby using price, volume, econometrics on price data and probability theory to extract profits from the markets. Research what firms like renaissance technologies, d.e. shaw ect are doing. Edward thorpe also has some good some stuff, especially his stuff on blackjack. I would recommend reading some stuff on richard dennis, his methods are very trivial by today's standard's but it will make some light bells go off. Also the work of benoit mandelbrot, for me his work has made the biggest impact on me with regards to the way i approach the financial market.<p>Also don't limit yourself to the stock market, you should really look at derivatives across all markets especially exotics, there is so much inneficiency it is not even funny.

It looks very open and welcoming (initially, at least), if you share those opinions, but it's obviously ridiculously narrow-minded, if you don't.",1289708478

If you want to copy, say 47 shorts, the loop would need to iterate five times, and there would be seven shorts left to copy.<p>Duff's uses the switch to jump into the middle of the loop just far enough to copy those seven leftover shorts (47 % 8 = 7).

They do not allow their employees to use their credit cards to buy technology off of the Internet. In fact, at many companies, doing so and attempting to expense it after the fact is a fire-able offense."" Which is not true at all. The US Government uses credit cards, many employees have one and I know for sure that the US Border Patrol vehicles have a credit card assigned to each vehicle (with a no approval needed limit of $2500 per purchase). My wife works for a large university and also has a department issued credit card.<p>Also I object to ""If you work in a startup, you might wonder why large organizations don’t just trust their people to make smart purchasing decisions. If an employee needs a new technology, why wouldn’t the company just let him do the right thing? There are many reasons:"" In the case of my wife's most recent laptop she did have some restrictions - it had to come from the University computer store which limited her choice to Apple, Dell, Lenovo or HP. Some limit. Oh, and it had to be under $2000.<p>He also states ""Some of the systems are outdated, complex, and downright arcane. Nonetheless, once deployed, enterprises develop great affection for the technology that runs their companies. They may complain about it, but like an old woman speaking of her spouse, the underlying love is far stronger than the criticism. And big companies expect you to love their old products too – by integrating with them."" I believe that this is also incorrect. I don't think businesses love their old systems, just that they are stuck with them. The business needs to function everyday, it can't just try something new, it needs to keep going. So old systems become like a heroin addiction for the company. They would love to get off the 30 year old stuff, but they can't.

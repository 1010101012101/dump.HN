A Lone Ranger cannot finish it in two months and even so it would not be of good quality and patched potential security holes. By the time the 'beta' is released to the public after two months, who exactly is the target market? You don't know what I am developing, you don't know who is going to use it, or who will pay for it, and of course no business plan either.<p>Work on the business plan first, research the market doing a SWOTT (Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities Threats Trends), pick the platform and language best suited for the project, write the proof of concept or 'beta', and then recruit beta testers to work out the bugs, and then after patching all the bugs and security holes you can release it and raise money to go public or whatever.<p>I'm not like these other guys, I have experience, I know what I am doing and how to turn a profit. I can smell failure like your offer. I don't want to create yet another Dotbomb that self-destructs.<p>Sure I got countless project ideas, why don't I do at least one of them? Well I have to do a feasibility study and all I mentioned above.<p>I've been throwing around project ideas with former business partners of mine. I ran two small businesses before, I've worked for FORTUNE 500 companies, I worked for small and medium businesses, I've worked for a college, I've done software consulting for the US Army and Federal Government. We don't do anything until we've done all the research first.<p>As tempting as that $8000 offer is, I'd be doing 100% of the work writing the software, and then you get 50% of the stock. I put in $2M USD worth of labor for a multimillion dollar project, and for your $8000 you get half the stock? I can find users and promote my web site for free you know.<p>Anyway thanks for the good laugh, I'd rather take my time and do it right than rush into two months with no research done at all.",1357858737

Every OO language out there has different set of features, and the only thing this definition is useful is for bashing opponents over the head with ""ah, you don't want this feature? But language X has it, and our vision says we have to be full-featured, so we need to add it no matter what!"" Java has checked exceptions? Then PHP should have checked exceptions, otherwise it's not full-featured. And so on. I don't see this as specific vision, but rather as a cart-blanche to abandon reason and consideration.

Each time you download an executable filebe it an exe for Windows, apk for Android, a Linux binary, an OS X executableyou're doing the same thing. I'll go one step further: each time you download a free/open source tarball you <i>do not</i> read the code before typing `make`. You make your machine run some code of unknown functionality and only plausible origin.<p>Arguably, HTTPS is one step forward, however vulnerabilities like the one discussed here make us defenceless. To make matters worse the line of defence based on reading the script works only in the case of relatively short, unobfuscated and unminified scripts written in plain text. It also requires the person who's downloading to have skills which despite being common for this community's audience are not widely spread across the population.<p>Sure, many projects sign their releases or announce cryptographic hashes of published files.

Since the values x and y don't depend on each other, they could each be calculated in any order.  However, with C, the programmer must explicitly decide on the temporal order that x and y are calculated (the order they appear in a function), even though it doesn't matter.  And yes, the C compiler may decide to re-order those calculations under the covers as it decides (for performance reasons perhaps).<p>With Haskell, when you are outside I/O Monads and such, you don't specify the order of calculations like the above.  Those two calculations may appear in that order in the source code, but the Haskell programmer knows that doesn't mean anything.  The system may calculate x first, y first, or perhaps neither if those values aren't actually used elsewhere.  Temporal ordering is not necessary (or desirable) under most circumstances.<p>You can never forget about temporal order in C, but there are higher level languages that allow this.",1357856581

5040158,comment,5039506,5039506,2,0,hdivider,,,"Memorisation sucks - I remember having to memorise a similar number of proofs, years ago. (And then again a year or so later, in electromagnetism.)<p>Here are some things that helped me, personally:<p>Proofs usually have two things that you can focus on if you're having trouble getting them internalised: <i>intro formalism</i> and some <i>key twists</i>.<p>The intro formalism is just the stuff that will be used in the proof - you've seen this: new definitions, maybe new symbols, and maybe some assumptions and 'wordy stuff'.
Focus on understanding and recalling these <i>first</i>. Even if you can find it easier to recall other, more mathematical facts about the proof, it's possible you'll end up with a muddled argument, because the intro stuff usually makes things precise, and eliminates edge cases.<p>Once you've got the beginning formalism sorted out in your mind, the rest is the hard stuff: the key twists, the actual logic being performed. What I found useful is to avoid memorising every logical step in a derivation as a separate thing. Instead, memorise a few in-between steps and <i>construct exercises for yourself</i> by trying to go from the intro stuff and the in-between steps to the actual final proof.<p>I used to have a little notebook with my own exercises in them, all constructed from proofs that I had to memorise. I didn't do this for each and every proof, just for the ones that were conceptually troublesome.<p>The key is to make the memorisation of proofs more like regular mathematics with exercises - with the full proofs being the solution to the exercises.<p>Another point - and this is somewhat unorthodox: for very hard proofs, the key mathematical machinery being used can be set at a level that's actually too high for your current course. I found this quite frustrating, so (in these cases only) I decided to focus on (almost) rote memorisation first, and <i>then</i> understanding. I know that goes against the usual advice of understanding always trumping mere recall, but exams that force you to memorise lots of proofs are an artificial condition anyway; real-world maths isn't like this. So weigh this for yourself - maybe start with memorising hard stuff, then gradually chip away at it and try to understand it if you can.<p>All this obviously takes time, and for ~50 proofs this implies a substantial amount of work. I'm guessing you still have a fair amount of time left until your exam, so it's best to do this stuff early and consistently.<p>I've got a chapter on memorisation in my book about maths-heavy exams [1] - but it's not a free ebook. However, if you want it, send me an email and I'll send you the .mobi if you wish (or we can share via dropbox, rapidshare - we're spoilt for choice :)) - maybe some parts of it could help.<p>[1]: www.amazon.com/Exam-Mastery-excel-maths-heavy-ebook/dp/B00AMU20HE/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1355929591&sr=8-4&keywords=exam+mastery",1357856459

Other than that, how does it not? At each step of your life ""now"" you attempt to do something that benefits someone's life (probably yours) and doesn't harm anyone. Yes, there are other ways of approaching life (most people do stuff that doesn't really make anyone's life better most of the time).... but would you really argue that those are paths you should strive to follow?   As a guideline, I think it's pretty good, and other than the edge case mentioned above, I can't think of an instance where it isn't the best path to follow.

When I discovered that the best way to get an A in my math theory classes was to memorize proofs, I pretty much guaranteed that I wasn't going to get good at math.<p>Before I discovered this, I did the homework and learned from it, and I tried to figure out proofs in the moment during exams.  One of my proudest moments was on an advanced linear algebra test, where I proved a theorem in a way that was not anticipated by the professor.  He wrote a nice note next to my proof.  But I missed more than I got, and I received a B+ in the class.<p>Later, I figured out that most professors rarely present completely new theorems on undergraduate exams, so I copied everything down and especially attended the pre-exam review sessions.  I learned everything by heart.  If you asked me how to prove anything that the prof had reviewed, I could bounce it to you immediately.  I think my abstract algebra teacher had been doing some of it on the spot, because when I regurgitated one of his proofs back to him on an exam, he wrote a nice note next to it as well.  It didn't feel nearly as great it had when it was really my own creativity, I remember thinking, ""don't you realize you did this in class?""<p>Now, of course you can't learn it by rote.  It's impossible to learn something as complicated as a proof, even a short one, without understanding it.  So my advice about learning the proofs by heart is to make sure you completely understand them.  I found that I still did get stuck, and I came up with little memory tricks - not mathematical things, the kind of tricks you'd use to remember people's names.<p>There was a rare breed of student who didn't memorize the proofs, and only sometimes came to class.  They'd get the questions right on the exams anyway.  The professors loved them.<p>I doubt I'm smart enough, but I do feel that I might have eliminated my chance of become one of these students by making sure I was an A student who memorized proofs rather than a B student, for a while, who understood the underpinnings and used logic and deduction (gasp! mathematical reasoning).<p>The best solution, I'd say, is to go ahead and memorize those proofs, since grades do matter an you aren't getting into a top grad school with mainly B's (and if you're doing this for engineering or something, I guess to some extent it's just something to get through).  But if you care about math theory and want to be good at it, make sure you spend a lot of time working independently on problems that don't have an answer you can memorize.",1357855241

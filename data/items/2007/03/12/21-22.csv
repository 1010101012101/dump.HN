3787,comment,3670,3770,0,0,immad,,,"agreed, clearly the discontinuity in the demand is based on the non-price costs, which is why people like the idea of easy micropayments so much. But the psychological difference between free and not-free is pretty significant.",1173736650
3786,comment,3769,3769,0,0,imp,,,"I had no idea the returns for investors was so low.  There has to be more to the story other than a bunch of people chasing the next Google or Microsoft.  If I remember correctly, pg said they started yc because it was fun and sort of like a real-life hack.  Maybe other investors feel the same way.  Or maybe they enjoy getting involved with the latest and greatest technology companies.  If I had tons of cash, this type of investing would be a lot more fun than watching my money slowly grow in an indexed mutual fund.",1173735302

3780,comment,3670,3733,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"I think how you fix the problem is finding other means to make money rather than having users pay. <p>The one issue with this is that it smacks of dot-bomb ""Build it and they will come"" thinking. <p>Although a few leaders will emerge, I don't think it's a viable theory for most start-ups. You're better off lowering your expectations and sharing a piece of a smaller pie. <p>Of course, VC's don't like that thinking too much.",1173733655

Although recently I was looking at PayScale (http://www.payscale.com/), and thought that if I was looking for a job I would probably buy a premium report from them.  In this case the $20 report could help negotiate a few extra thousand dollars in salary.",1173733320

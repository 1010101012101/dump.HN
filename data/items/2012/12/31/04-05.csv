But if I successfully lobbied and passed a law saying that anyone who swore, in public or in private, owed me a nickel, that law wouldn't last long. People wouldn't obey it, and sufficient application of force and surveillance to successfully enforce would only result in riots in the streets. There is more to lawmaking than desire.<p>The problem is that technology has changed our reality. Making the artifact of media used to be difficult, hence profitable, centralized, and regulatable. In that context, protection is easy and acceptable. If a rogue publisher bucked the system, you could march in, trash his equipment and send the other publishers a signal. Now the equipment is in the pocket of hundreds of millions of people, for completely different reasons that are more important than movies.<p>This TPB article is about one form of online sharing that is actually pretty easy to track. What you need to consider is offline sharing, which is next to impossible to track. Today's desktop hard drive can store roughly 2,000 movies, which with proper curation is basically every movie that matters. In five years, hard drives should be able to store 16 times that - certainly every movie and song that matters. Families will keep an encrypted heirloom drive of every piece of media they value, and share it when no one is looking. If searched, they would present a different file listing.<p>What will you do then? How can you regulate something that you cannot see? You can try to burn a couple of offenders at the stake, but that's only going to make you look like a monster. I wish that I had an answer for you, but I don't yet, and neither is it my responsibility to have one. I can only tell you that times are changing. This constant refrain of finding a new business model is not to throw you out of the castle, but to warn you of the coming storm.<p>The truth is that as much as we would like to help, as <i>profitable</i> as it would be to help, we can't figure out how to prevent copying. As far as we can tell, <i>no one</i> can prevent copying without outlawing computers entirely. So no, we are not an ignorant mob storming the vineyard. We are an intelligent mob trying to save those old vines from the coming eternal frost, and hoping that someone figures out how to grow them somewhere else. The destruction is out of our control. Apple and Amazon are doing the best jobs with the iTunes and Kindle stores, but even those look like passing fads when you could have a local copy of every movie, song, and book that has ever been notable.<p>I hope that you realize that I would love to help you, WE would love to help you, if we had any idea how. Every VC would fund someone who could make this happen. All that we know right now is that legislation will not work, and will have vicious unintended consequences.",1356929580

4988430,comment,4987008,4987806,1,0,hosh,,,"Generally, I think ubiquitous, cheap, personal manufacturing is a good thing. <i>If</i> we have a number of Open Source products we can print out. That will substantially lower the cost of living for everyone. Hopefully, the vast majority of retailers will turn into service providers.<p>There may still be folks who want to license designs out.<p>Nobody trusts a corporation to enforce their DRM mechanism because they get to be the final arbiter of what is ""fair"". What is fair is always good for the corporation, never mind the user. They may die and kill off access to those goods. The other extreme is hypocritical, simply because we run our digital goods through hardware -- all resting on the notion of allocation of resources. Besides, content creators want to eat, too.<p>A reasonable compromise is to have the DRM enforced by someone other than the seller. An escrow service is an improvement, but is not much better. And no one wants to depend on the government to host DRM servers. A peer-to-peer DRM might work. Bitcoin is an example of a technology that can be modified for this: <a href=""http://codinginmysleep.com/exotic-transaction-types-with-bitcoin/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codinginmysleep.com/exotic-transaction-types-with-bit...</a><p>The mediation is done peer-to-peer. You can, for example, sign a bitcoin contract saying you are lending an ebook to a friend, and have it published elsewhere. Granted, this would all be on an honor system -- if you can play back media, then you have access to the content, no amount of clever algorithms or coding can change that -- but so is much of the enforcement for civilized interaction. A small group will ""cheat"", the same way there are breakage in a retail store. If the voluntary participation of such a scheme benefits everyone involved and is not too inconvenient (centralized DRM servers that crash or gets taken down when the company dies, or requires a constant internet connection), I think most people will go for it.<p>It's best we experiment this kind of transaction with digital products, <i>before</i> 3D technologies get good enough that people start buying design licenses for goods.<p>Better yet, we make sure we have Open Source versions of products that people can download and print out.",1356929562

4988411,comment,4987795,4987795,1,0,dmotz,,,"I think this argument, ad hominem aside, loses a bit of validity with every subsequent smartphone/tablet generation. Every advance in CPUs and JavaScript interpreters blurs the line more if we're looking at a hybrid app developed by a competent team.<p>As to where I'm coming from in this argument, yes, I currently develop mobile apps using web technologies. [1]<p>And yes, I completely agree that the majority of web view/hybrid apps I've encountered have had poor user experiences. But the field of hybrid apps is new and everyone can recall the poor user experiences of desktop web apps in their nascent era.<p>As with the age of MapQuest, the sample size of hybrid apps is still small and thus well-designed and well-coded apps are scarce. Aesthetics give probably the biggest impression of mobile software quality, and you can either choose to stick to stock SDK UI, or implement your own visual language. The former is safe and is the default for native development. Hybrid apps almost always fail when trying to mimic it completely and users are (at least subconsciously) repelled by the uncanny valley these apps may land in. The latter option of introducing a unique UI is exceedingly difficult to pull off, hybrid or native, but is a route of convenience for hybrid developers, but again, they usually fail to create something a user can feel comfortable with.<p>In short, if you're serious about your app's reception, it is more difficult to pull off the user experience using web technologies, contrary to the article's assertion. Hybrid app developers cannot rely on native UI elements and this is why they tend to be received so poorly.<p>So why have I chosen the hybrid approach? Mainly because I'm a futurist and I see the immense value in having an open lingua franca for app development over fractured proprietary environments. The cross platform benefits appeal to me less, and at the time of this writing, I consider iOS to be ahead of the other platforms in fidelity of rendering web content (Android 4 is catching up). I fully admit this benefit is half-baked at the moment, but I don't need any pundit predictions to know it will improve by bounds in the next few years.<p>JS isn't a silver bullet, but it's undeniably exploding at the moment, especially in terms of flexibility (browser, server, mobile). You could invest your time in mastering a proprietary platform's SDK, but besides only focusing on non-portable knowledge, you could also find yourself with a dying marketshare for your chosen platform. I definitely don't mean to discredit native languages by any means, I just want to convey how I came to conclude that hybrid is a safe investment in mastering. Many apps, whether simple CRUD apps, or thin front ends for REST APIs, have no specific need for native code. Even Microsoft --seen among the symbols of proprietary control -- are embracing the HTML5 stack for apps. The benefit of being able to reuse the libraries and APIs [2] when bringing an app to another platform shouldn't be underestimated, nor the potential growth of mobile-oriented common knowledge in a common language.<p>Is it really difficult to believe that in a few years phones will be running WebGL-powered 3D games with advanced shader effects, on par with native games? Not really, considering how rapidly we're approaching that point on the desktop. It's even easier when you consider the hybrid app bottleneck is usually DOM painting, not JS execution, and WebGL would potentially use the mobile device's GPU. This problem is almost solved already with intelligent DOM manipulation and CSS3 transforms, (or potentially other approaches [3]).<p>Writing a quality hybrid app at the moment is very hard. Web views have less memory available, execution is slower, and simple DOM rendering is expensive and slow unless all optimized properly. Furthermore, aesthetics are harder to pull off when working outside SDK UI sets. But hybrid apps are a relatively new field and have enormous potential. I don't it's very mature yet, but neither was the web itself for a very long time. I think having a common, open set of tools is worth defending from accusations like this one or the red herrings thrown around regarding HTML5's role in the Facebook app. This is definitely the more forward-thinking bet.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://chaincalapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chaincalapp.com</a><p>[2] - specifically HTML5 device APIs as well as <a href=""http://phonegap.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phonegap.com</a><p>[3] - <a href=""http://famo.us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://famo.us</a>",1356929010

GMail is arguably one of the most successful and mature web apps out there, but at the end of the day you're still just reading mail, clicking a few places to change how information is presented, and typing a bunch of text. None of this requires a lot of real-time assistance as you navigate the information, context-sensitive UI, or task-specific controls beyond regular menu/toolbar/icon kinds of things, for example.<p><i>And why not mathematical modelling/simulation?  you can access a lot more computational power on servers.</i><p>Well, I think that point is debatable if you're doing serious modelling more than occasionally. The kind of processing power required makes it cheaper to buy your own high-end systems than to use commodity cloud-provided facilities very quickly, and for the same reason I suspect it would be difficult to offer such services economically in SaaS form.<p>Also, real time graphic visualisations in web apps are still far slower and less sophisticated than what you can achieve natively with modern graphics cards, at least for now. If you're watching a couple of pretty graphics in an analytics tool, that doesn't matter. Even some basic 3D work is starting to get interesting with technologies like WebGL arriving.

Even if every game, on average, took in the same amount of money once it hits critical mass, players aren't going to invest in games that their friends aren't playing, so splitting the audience up hurts Zynga. Their growth strategy was one of complete content saturation using fast-follow tactics. ""If they aren't playing Zynga game X, then we want to make sure the other game they will be playing will be Zynga game Y instead."" This worked during the explosive growth period, but it's very wasteful now growth is slowing or even shrinking (I'd need to look at the numbers more closely).<p>As was also mentioned elsewhere, players are always hungry for new items, and my guess is that Zynga has plenty of metrics to indicate that new items is where the money goes (a hefty dose of behavioral economics like scarcity is used on those ones). Simply leaving a game open, or closing it to new players, is probably leaving money on the table. That said, I think there's a big risk in teaching players that their virtual items really do just disappear into the ether.<p>My guess is it's the right move for Zynga to make, but Indiana Jones and Mafia Wars 2 is a huge blow to them.

I don't think that too many people who are smart enough to code would be willing to put in the effort to continue developing them, because the games don't have enough depth to capture an intelligent person's attention.<p>Also, it's doubtful that the company would be interested in open sourcing them, because they don't really care about gaming or gamers, they just saw a quick way to make money.<p>There's nothing wrong with having money be your top priority (to each their own) but in Zynga's case it's obvious that it's their only priority.",1356926679

That's not at all the same as watching it in its ""proper"" time slot on CBS via DirecTv or Comcast. If Intel offered show subs only on the basis of a 24-hr delay they'd be at a big disadvantage.<p>They could make up some of the difference by offering a really smart dvr-type system with a clean interface (pay for all the Tivo patent licenses and go beyond them), so their set top box knows what you want and gets it automatically with no fuss -- but they'd still be selling yesterday's TV today. And the cable and dish providers can play the smart dvr card as well, with current content.<p>And in any case, there are times when you want this minute's content this minute: news, commentary, sports. When Intel gets a contract to resell ESPN or Fox Sports Net, live, I'll be a believer.",1356926652

The sense of speed and freedom is amazing, like rediscovering the joy of a bike without training wheels. If I can offer one piece of advice, it is to find a group of like-minded cyclists to ride with. Nothing builds camaraderie like toiling in the saddle with four other guys on a Cat-2 climb, and you will learn so much from their experience.",1356926571

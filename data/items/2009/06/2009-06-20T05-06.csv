For example, if your parser is for the regexp ""a+"" and you give the string ""aaabc"", then the parser can return ((""a"" . ""aabc"") (""aa"" . ""abc"") (""aaa"" . ""bc"")] to say that it can interpret ""aaabc"" in 3 ways. You can transform this into the ""longest"" parse by filtering this list for the shortest ""remaining string"".<p>If your parser returns [] it means it cannot parse the string, so it all fits together. I don't know if I can find the time to rewrite the code to show you explicitly how this could help, but looking at Parsec (in Haskell) will give you a good idea of what I'm talking about<p><a href=""http://legacy.cs.uu.nl/daan/download/parsec/parsec.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://legacy.cs.uu.nl/daan/download/parsec/parsec.html</a>",1245477582

To do it well requires a skill-set and personality that are at odds with other types of work.<p>I get very frustrated with things that don't work, don't respond usefully, that make me waste time and that can't be automated (to require less supervision).  That frustration builds up and drives me to improve things, great for machines but almost always self-defeating around people.",1245476601

There is a certain amount of frustration that comes with the job.<p>I'm also, if I can toot my own horn for a bit, really freaking good at it.  My secret is that I don't answer phone calls.  A puppet answers phone calls.  I just manipulate the puppet such that the customer and company come out to a mutually beneficial resolution.  If you need to vent a bit at the puppet, that is no problem -- the puppet does not mind.  Can't decide between two equivalent black pens?  The puppet does not mind.  The puppet seeks only your happiness.<p>At the end of my shift I put the puppet away and go home.<p>My puppet also works well for technical support of non-technical customers these days.  Can't download your website to the monitor?  The puppet sympathizes and is happy to walk you through every step.<p>[Edited to add:<p>Credit where credit is due: The puppet phrasing is borrowed from a old Joel post.

666156,comment,665844,666081,0,0,jerf,,,"Following up on your comment, it can be more-or-less <i>proved</i> that human color is a neural construction based on light input by looking at things like optical illusions, such as this classic white-lines-and-black-boxes affair: <a href=""http://www.michaelbach.de/ot/lum_herGrid/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.michaelbach.de/ot/lum_herGrid/index.html</a><p>You might think this isn't a color demonstration, but it is actually a compelling example that beyond just the spectrum of the photons hitting your eye, the brain is doing a lot of additional work involving what we call ""colors"". Further evidence: The broad similarities between what attributes cultures ascribe to colors. Yes, there are differences too, but there's a lot of correlations there, added by your brain, which comes preprogrammed with some meaning-ish things. (It's not that direct, but since I'm working in English here that sentence will have to do.) We know we share similar ""red"" and ""green"" experiences because we share their clashing effect. I'm not sure if there's anybody who has ever moved from not-red-green-colorblind to red-green-colorblind, but in a real sense, a red-green colorblind person is seeing a different color, with different properties and different aesthetics. Their aesthetics aren't wrong, just different.<p>(Related: It is frequently complained that aliens on TV are just humans with a bit of latex stuck to them, but there are numerous other ways in which aliens are just ""humans with bits stuck on"", and one of the most notable is how many alien civilizations basically <i>look good</i> on TV. I'm willing to buy that an alien race building a real engineering artifact will build something with a <i>form</i> that appeals to us, just as many aliens-on-earth do (spiders, for instance), but their colors ought to be alternatively garish beyond belief, subdued beyond our ability to recognize (10 million shades of blue and combinations of blue), or just plain random (a gamut twice ours, perhaps, or a race with no equivalent to vision at all, though I find that one hard to swallow), as they work with colors that may happen to share the same wavelengths of light (or not) but otherwise have nothing in common with human colors.)<p>In other interesting thoughts, when we can directly stimulate the human optic nerve, I look forward to the seeing what happens when we move out of the CIE color space. IIRC, the boundaries of the CIE color space represent the point where the three color receptors in the eye would need a negative photon to generate that result, which can't exist in real life. This implies to me that such values <i>could</i> be generated by direct stimulation, though. Are there colors that no human has ever seen, but nearly every human is equipped to experience in much the same way as any other color, in some sense as much a color as any of the ones we know? Perhaps some of us will even find out, some day.",1245474550

666153,comment,665876,666025,0,0,sho,,,"<i>""hard to believe the guys at automattic are stupid so if it doesn't exist already, there is probably a reason""</i><p>Well, exactly. They have had the idea before, as mentioned in the post, but didn't act on it. They probably did a simple cost/benefit analysis and decided it would be more trouble than it's worth.<p>Once you start taking money and acting like a shop, everything changes. It's not just the implementation, although that would be significant. But suddenly it's your problem if X breaks on IE8 or Y doesn't work with a new version and the developer is on holiday or Z said it would do this but doesn't and the customer demands a refund, etc etc etc. ""But I bought it from you!"" comes the flood of email. So you'd probably need support staff too.<p>Well, all of this might be worthwhile if it's a big, rich market. But I doubt it is. How many people actually buy premade WP themes? I would have thought the number is miniscule. Same with plugins. I didn't even realise you <i>could</i> buy WP plugins, actually, until I read that. The idea sounds like a joke. You'd have to be nuts to try and build a business on that.<p>Anyway I'm sure Automattic thought about it for a while, then realised what a distracting, unremunerative hassle it would be and rightfully canned the idea.",1245474147

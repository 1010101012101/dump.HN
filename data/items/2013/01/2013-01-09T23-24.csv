Super HD is only available via Internet Providers that are part of the Open Connect network.<p>From <a href=""https://signup.netflix.com/openconnect"" rel=""nofollow"">https://signup.netflix.com/openconnect</a>:<p>>ISPs can directly connect their networks to Open Connect for free. ISPs can do this either by free peering with us at common Internet exchanges, or can save even more transit costs by putting our free storage appliances in or near their network.<p>>Major ISPs around the world have already connected to Open Connect, including Frontier, British Telecom, TDC, Clearwire, GVT, Telus, Bell Canada, Virgin, Cablevision, Google Fiber, Telmex, and more.<p>That sounds like something that would be hard to get an American ISP to agree to, since some have their own offerings (Comcast's stake in Hulu and own Xfinity, for example.)",1357775922

5034355,comment,5033498,5034012,18,0,rada,,,"Just tried the website out and can't resist jumping in either. Sorry to be harsh but I really don't appreciate a long questionnaire with a forced sign up under the pretense of personalization when really, none is offered in the end. Why did I just spend 10 minutes filling out all the information only to be offered none of what I asked for?<p>There has to be a term for this as it happens very often: describe a common, frustrating consumer problem thereby implying that your product will solve it; follow up with a bunch of exciting and mystery-building hand waiving; finally, unveil your cheap, run-of-the-mill product identical to all the other cheap, run-of-the-mill products already on the market. At the end of the day, the website sells the same stuff that you'd find at any lower-priced mass retailer and doesn't appear to actually curate its supposedly personalized ""my shop"" based on my answers.<p>Some more impressions. One, it's rather discrediting for a ""true fit"" company not to offer true fit sizes such as AA for example. Two, it's rather annoying when a sales page asks for your preferences (brand, coverage, etc) and then proceeds to suggest things that are the exact opposite. Three, those impractical, showy ""sexy time"" bras, which seem to be 90% of the inventory, require panties to match, otherwise there is literally no point to them. Four, it's rather lame for a supposedly women-oriented website  to push those fake silicone inserts as tough there is something wrong with real women's breasts.<p>Yes, bra fit is a big problem, and yes, it's a disruption opportunity. But I fail to see how True & Co has an interesting approach. They sell the same brands as everyone else and ignore your preferences just like those overworked, disinterested sales people. The shipping is free but if you have to return anything - which at a minimum of 5 bras per shipment is virtually guaranteed - it is easier to just go to your local mass retailer and try things on.",1357775783

It made the movie look like it was shot on video, and in that mode the various prop items stood out. In one scene the jeep in the background, and the background in general, is clearly painted on a flat surface. Without the motion compensation on that jeep looked like it could be a real jeep in the scene. Very weird effect.",1357775780

Anthony was very specific in the fact that his concept of a ""vision"" is about the paradigms PHP supports:<p>> 1. ""PHP Should Strive To Be A Full Featured Object Oriented Language"".<p>> 2. ""PHP Should Remain A Procedural Language WIth Some OO Features""<p>> 3. ""PHP Should Be Implementation Neutral, and Support All Paradigms Equally"".<p>Rasmus' response was more general, about the vision for who and what they'd like to enable with the language.<p>There may be a bit of cross over, but they are two distinctly different views. And for what its worth, I think both are correct. I think PHP should choose to be one of the three things Anthony suggested, and stick to it. This would help in discussions about what features to take on board in new versions. I also think that Rasumus is right in that PHP is a general purpose scripting language with a focus on web development. However this is more about the type of people you will get interested in using and contributing to the language.<p>EDIT: Grammar",1357775464

There is always a risk involved with business, not earning profits, not innovating properly, your competitors have better products and better customer service, etc.<p>Before Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook etc there were companies like DEC, Wang, Sperry, Excite, Lycos, Frindster, Myspace, Commodore, Atari, etc.<p>DEC and Wang and Sperry basically went out of business due to Microsoft and the IBM PC Clones taking away business from their minicomputer market. Who needs a DEC Vax or WANG VS when you can run these cheaper PC clones with MS-DOS or Windows? I was a programmer than ported code from Mainframes and Minicomputers to the PC, so that employers I worked for could get rid of the 'dinosaurs' and switch to a client-server model with PCs instead.<p>Excite and Lycos had web search engines, email, and other features, Google came out and somehow put them out of business even if they all did the same things.<p>Frindster and Myspace, where the original social networking sites, Facebook put them out of business as did GPlus and LinkedIn and others.<p>Commodore and Atari still exist but are shells of what they used to be. Bankruptcy after bankruptcy, they were bought and sold. Atari had the lead in the arcade and video game console markets, but they treated their programmers like crap and limited the amount of memory they could use for the 2600 cartridges. Many Atari programmers left to found Activation, Imagic, and others and later on Atari found out that anyone can make video games for the 2600 console without paying Atari royalties or licenses. Atari tried other game consoles like the 5200 and 7800 that didn't do so well, and never made the Graduatior Keyboard to turn the Atari 2600 into a full blown Computer. The Atari 8 bit series did well, the Atari 400, 800, 800XL, 1200XL but they needed something better as Apple was catching up with the IIc series. Jack Tramiel left Commodore and bought Atari and put his son Sam Tramiel in charge of making the Atari ST series with DRI's GEM as a GUI and TOS. It was cheaper than Apple's Macintosh and did color. Meanwhile at Commodore they had a good run on the VIC-20 and later Commodore 64, and released the Commodore 128 that ran C64 programs and CP/M programs. Commodore bought the Amiga company in a bidding war with Atari, Commodore released the Commodore Amiga 1000 in 1985 around the same time as the Atari ST and both had almost the same features. The Amiga was Tripos based, written in BCPL, and had the GUI of Workbench. Both Commodore and Atari had an advantage over the Macintosh and PC, they had better sound, more colors, and sold their computers for a fraction of the price of a real Macintosh or PC. But that quickly ended as Apple made the Macintosh II line with faster CPUs, and IBM developed the PS/2 series with VGA and AdLib/Soundblaster sound cards became standard in the PC industry. Once Windows 95 came out, it not only blew away the Atari ST or Amiga, it even hurt Apple's Macintosh sales. Atari and Commodore could not get enough software developers to support their platform other than some video game makers. Atari tried the 64 bit Jaguar video game console and it was a flop. Commodore tried to make the Amiga into the CD32 video game console, but it flopped because of a patent troll over the use of the XOR function to blink the cursor.<p>People are only now finding out that Apple's stock was way over valued and over hyped, and that without Steve Jobs Apple's products are not as good in quality as they used to be. Apple Maps was a disaster and iOS 6 is buggy on older devices but not the newer devices.<p>Microsoft too is over hyped and over valued in stock. Windows 8 isn't doing too great, most sales are new system sales with Windows 8 pre-bundled, but most people downgrade to Windows 7 or XP, and some even go to Linux. The Microsoft Surface tablets have major flaws, and they are to Apple's iPad what the Microsoft Zune was to the Apple iPod. The XBox 360 is poor quality crap with overheating issues causing a red ring of death, and now lower cost Android based video game consoles are coming out that not only work better but can do a lot of things the XBox 360 cannot. Almost every web project Microsoft tried has failed, Hotmail, Windows Live, MSN, now they regrouped with Bing and migrating Windows Live to Skydrive and Skype.<p>Anyway IBM once was the tech giant that everyone came after to try and beat, it is no longer a tech giant. Everyone cloned their PC/AT series, Microsoft back-stabbed them in DOS and OS/2, Amdal and others cloned their mainframes, their AIX RS/4000 series lost out to Linux, IBM eventually migrated to Linux in order to survive.<p>Remember Novel? They had a product called Netware that did file and print services for DOS and Windows machines. Until Microsoft developed Windows NT Server, and Linux had a SAMBA project to work as a file and print server for PCs. Novel was a giant, but not so much now. They migrated to Linux as well to survive.<p>You will find that over 90% of incubator projects fail, and become Dotbombs. Of the 20 top billion dollar industries, only thee of them were incubator projects. That is because most of them don't have a valid working business plan. Almost all of them have a freenium model of the web site is free, and they sell advertising and sell user private info, but that isn't enough to work anymore. Many fail because they didn't do the research into seeing if the project is feasible, or if there is even a need for it in the market and how many people exist in that market. Most just go coding on day one, work 20 hour days, 6 days a week and burn themselves out with almost nothing to show for it in revenue. Once the seed money is gone, your employees walk out the door because you cannot pay them salaries anymore. Thus projects are half-finished, and they are in some programming language like Go that is too new to find enough programmers willing to work cheap to finish it. The three that became billion dollar companies basically won the lottery.<p>Knowing computer science and engineering is great, but learn business management as well.",1357775387

A lot can change in 10 years.<p>---<p>A few (IPOd) likely contenders:<p>Google - Currently the second highest tech valuation. They seem to be one of the only companies putting serious resources in shaping the future (self driving cars, mining asteroids). I can totally see Google being the company that introduces personal assistant robots in homes.<p>Amazon - Brick and mortar stores will continue to get outclassed by the online experience. Amazon will be THE way to shop, including groceries and everyday items. They will grow into their crazy high P/E and begin to expand margins.<p>Apple - I think Apple will fall for a number of reasons, the biggest being the passing of Steve Jobs. Their products are great but they can't continue to grow the way they have the last 5 years (we are already starting to see this). They will continue to make solid products but I see them in the same vain as Microsoft circa '99.<p>Facebook - I am a long-term believer of Facebook but acknowledge they are the riskiest of the others listed so far. They certainly have the opportunity to be the biggest though. It really depends on two things: 1) how they fend off competitors and 2) how they monetize. Ya, those are two pretty huge things to depend on but like it or not they have the potential to be the biggest company in the world in 10 years.<p>A few non-IPO companies that have a shot:<p>Twitter - I'm not really sure about Twitter. Are they a protocol? Are they a media company? Are they an advertising firm? There is something about them though that sticks. I can totally see them as the biggest social network in 10 years. I can also see them as being a huge advertising firm if they can get metrics of how tweets influence customers (e.g. if Lebron James tweets that he is getting McDonalds for dinner, what percentage increase in sales does McDonalds get within an hour of that tweet?). I can see Twitter being a $100b company in 10 years if they can figure out how to understand their influential data.<p>Square - This company has the potential to monopolize phone payments. I can see our phones being the leading source of payments in the next few years so I think Square has the potential to get huuuuuge.<p>Dropbox - I'm not too sure about Dropbox. They provide a great experience but I just don't know that they have the potential to be the biggest company in the world. Data storage will not get them there - they have to expand into something more.<p>---<p>All that being said, I think Google and Amazon will fight for the biggest valuation in the world in 10 years.

C programmers can code procedurally and java guys can jump in and basically go all out with the OOP constructs provided. I've watched PHP get better over the years, and it continually does so, but after having switched recently to Ruby, I have to say a solid ""Benevolent Dictator"" would probably not be such a bad thing for the language. Ruby has its paradigms, its own way of doing things, and you frankly can't develop software in many ways PHP allows you to, but for me Ruby is still a much more succint and beautiful lang, one I enjoy programming in more, I think partially because it has this, a set way of thinking about software design. I mean unit tests are in the stdlib for example, and you can't program long in the language without using utils, gems, etc, that all are chalk full of test suits that pass.<p>IMHO, a programming language should not just focus on itself or whether it has such and such feature, but on how it can be used in the entire software development cycle. This is something Go and Ruby are doing exceptionally well, and is why I like using them so much to build software, whether its web or otherwise. Probably because of its history as a template language embedded into HTML (way back when :), PHP has still got some growing pains in order to build up its software development paradigms, but I'm still hopefull, it has gone amazingly far and continues to improve.",1357774739

A big wind farm is inherently linked into the power grid, and doesn't help you or me get off the grid.<p>Some sources that prompt my curiosity about these policies:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/12/business/energy-environment/a-cornucopia-of-help-for-renewable-energy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/12/business/energy-environmen...</a><p><a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/07/news/economy/energy-subsidies/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/07/news/economy/energy-subsidie...</a><p><a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/21556904"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/node/21556904</a><p><a href=""http://www.economist.com/debate/overview/217"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/debate/overview/217</a><p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443659204577575203384685874.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000087239639044365920457757...</a><p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444032404578008183300454400.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000087239639044403240457800...</a><p>For balance, critiques of other government subsidies for other industries (surely disfavored by Google):<p><a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=making-renewable-energies-competitive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=making-rene...</a><p><a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-10-21/when-it-comes-to-government-subsidies-dirty-energy-still-cleans-up"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-10-21/when-it-come...</a>",1357774513

Good ones are expensive ($60-100 a pop), and the less wear and tear on them the longer they last, and the longer the fit that you bought them for is preserved.<p>Panties are changed every day, and are cheap in comparison to bras.  You can get a 6-pack of cotton Hanes at Walmart for less than $10. Individual panties from a department store might cost $5-15 a pair. You can compromise on panty quality in a way you can't with bras. Cheap panties just fall apart a little faster. Cheap bras are daily torture.<p>I'd wager the average women most definitely owns 5 if not more pairs of panties for every bra she owns.<p>Edit to add: I would say the issue (with not seeing panties advertised as heavily on shopping networks) is more that panty quality is not so much of an issue. That 6-pack of Hanes will do you just fine and there's no constant <i>need</i> to find a better panty like there is to find a better bra. Bras suck, unless you've got small boobs.

For example:<p><i>> Imagine you had the lucky privilege to be invited by Peter Jackson onto the set of the Hobbit. You were standing right off to the side while they filmed Bilbo Baggins in his cute hobbit home. Standing there on the set you would notice the incredibly harsh lighting pouring down on Bilbo's figure. It would be obviously fake. And you would see the makeup on Bilbo's in the harsh light. The text-book reason filmmakers add makeup to actors and then light them brightly is that film is not as sensitive as the human eye, so these aids compensated for the film's deficiencies of being insensitive to low light and needing the extra contrast provided by makeup. These fakeries were added to ""correct"" film so it seemed more like we saw. But now that 48HFR and hi-definition video mimic our eyes better, it's like we are standing on the set, and we suddenly notice the artifice of the previously needed aids. When we view the video in ""standard"" format, the lighting correctly compensates, but when we see it in high frame rate, we see the artifice of the lighting as if we were standing there on the set.</i><p>This is easy to fix - change the makeup and lighting process.",1357773456

""How do you find them?"" ""What does it cost to reach them? Capture them?"" ""How do they compensate you and for how much over what timespan?"" and ""How does that money you get feed back into the business to grow it?""<p>You need to know those things, and know them with certainty. Sure you can say ""I have the secret knowledge of
the ancients and can make a perfect bra for any woman!""<p>And even if it is completely true and provable it is only one half of the picture. What if the cost to make them is $150, and their specialness fades in 3 months? Suddenly it doesn't matter that they are perfect, very few people will invest a couple thousand a year to keep a stock of perfect bras on hand. Or these bras are so well made they are indestructible! How cool is that, except if it costs $100 to 'fit' the person, and they buy one bra over their lifetime. Well that doesn't work either.

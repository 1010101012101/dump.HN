Since most of the 3rd party software is closed source I could not debug their code.
I ended up writing work-around code to circumvent the bugs in closed source 3rd party software.  And the culprit here is MS Excel and VBA.",1237700609

(and ... has this happened?).",1237699928

527016,comment,526140,526725,0,0,greendestiny,,,"""a bunch of bits have been made illegal""<p>I strongly disagree with this idea that I've seen a few times, that somehow the law is irrationally and ridiculously making bits illegal whether in copyright or in pornography. Child pornography is illegal whether its printed on paper or stored as bits. That somehow it shouldn't be a crime just because of the fact that bits can be used to represent anything is a really bad argument.",1237699324
527015,comment,526145,526145,0,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"The one reason why Firefox is so slow: XUL.<p>Has anyone noticed that other browsers using Gecko as their rendering engine (Epiphany, Galeon, etc.) are much faster than Firefox? AFAIK, these browsers are built using native toolkits (GTK+ for both Epiphany and Galeon) of whatever platform they work on. Also, has anyone noticed how slow Songbird is? That's XUL for you.<p>I don't care about extensions. IMO, a web browser is supposed to let you view and interact with webpages, nothing more, nothing less. Leave the ad blocking, note taking, email checking, photo uploading, iTunes controlling to separate applications. How difficult is it for Mozilla to just wrap up Gecko in a Cocoa shell for the Mac, GTK+/Qt shell for Linux and whatever toolkit is used these days on Windows? Why build the UI using XUL?<p>I'm an Opera user, but I hate the way they've been piling on feature after feature into the browser. BitTorrent? Speed Dial? If they don't stop now, I'll switch to something leaner.",1237699312

The pickaxe book was more helpful for me. I've been using ruby for more than 3 years now and I really enjoy it, so I get along with it OK.<p>To this day I still sometimes think that I should trudge through all of the poignant guide, but then I remember what a tedious time I had and decide not to.",1237698065

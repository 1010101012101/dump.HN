Getting in into an ivy league school is usually challenging, unless you&#x27;re born into money, you have to figure out a plan and correctly execute it in order to get in--just like meeting the right people, starting a business, and then getting funded.<p>Also I think we like to associate and surround ourselves with people of the same background.

Sometimes security features can be counterproductive since they can lead to the users making bad assumptions and therefore bad decisions that they otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have made. PGP in webmail implemented just in JS is likely one of these things that could make things worse due to how users treat them.",1379165367

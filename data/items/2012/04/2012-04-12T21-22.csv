You can trivially reverse that step and then get on attacking the rest of it.<p>After that, the attack is elementary:<p>You have two plaintexts, A and B. These are both xored with the same keystream X, so the attacker has access to both A ^ X and B ^ X.<p>Xoring both cipherstreams gives you A ^ X ^ B ^ X, which is equivalent to A ^ B.<p>Do you see the problem yet, or do I need to continue?<p>EDIT: The real point is if you're not a crypto expert, don't write crypto code. (If you are a crypto expert, you already know better than to try writing your own crypto code). Also, don't trust obscure web pages that present crypto implementations - use a widely-known (and hence widely-vetted) implementation instead.",1334267996

I like to think of Meteor as an ""application platform"" rather than a framework, because we're trying to take on some problems that web frameworks don't always tackle, like packaging and deployment. Also, we don't require you to use a particular strategy for generating HTML. For example, it makes sense to use backbone.js with Meteor, if that's your thing. At the end of the day, Meteor is about how you make all of the pieces fit together in a distributed cloud application.

You leave out the recent financial meltdown, a direct result of replacing 1930s era banking regulations with looser laws in the 80s and 90s. And you leave out the dot-com collapse, caused by dubious IPOs of the sort that SOX -- which JOBS would partially repeal -- was subsequently designed to counter.<p>This context is vital. The aggressively deregulatory JOBS act comes st a time when our regulatory framework has been exposed as woefully inadequate, in the midst of quickly ballooning tech valuations, and as we are seeing financial misstatements already from companies like Groupon that went public under the old, supposedly over-regulatory regime.<p>So yes, we should consider the historical context around the JOBS act. And I'd choose a vastly different frame than you have: Financial regulations designed to prevent bubble-depression cycles have been steadily stripped away since the 1930s, leading directly to the collapse of our economy in 2008 and the ensuing malaise.

Their only way of finding out is to send an email and hope for a return.<p>The family might be able to use emails to find evidence of a homicide, or the last location of the person (if they went missing). Or the family can finish up any unfinished business the deceased had, answer and respond to people who were expecting a reply from the (now) deceased person, or complaints. Imagine dying in the middle of fulfilling a successful kickstarter campaign. Imagine all those angry people trying to figure out why you haven't responded in months. The only way your family would find out about your Kickstarter campaign is through your emails. And that's just one example.<p>Emotionally releasing all your info might bother you, but logically it makes a lot of sense.

The net effect of that for startups is negative: it virtually eliminates one previously available path to liquidity. But the net effect of that <i>to society</i> has been to transfer a lot of risks that were previously borne by the public markets to private equity and VC. Is that a bad thing?<p>In other words: yes, way fewer IPOs. But also much higher quality IPOs. Even Groupon is superior in many ways to companies that managed to IPO towards the end of the first bubble. Also: companies without a clear path to acquisition are forced to adopt business models that distribute profits to owners (else why run the company). The end result of that might be pretty positive.<p>* The Crowdfunding provision in the act clearly doesn't ""legalize fraud"". That's a hyperbolic claim. But is it hyperbolic to say that it <i>simplifies and eases</i> fraud?

Usually for questions that come up in this shift, we have a good model we can look at, which is the client/server desktop applications of the  late 80s and early 90s.

There may be value in teasing them apart a bit.<p>For example: I've had dealings with a web forum for people suffering from chronic pain. These folk are very focussed on privacy (they're discussion very personal stuff they don't want the general public to see) and anonymity (they occasionally discuss the repurposing of recreational drugs that are illegal in some locations so they don't want their real identities becoming public) - but they're also <i>keenly</i> focussed on accountability (they need to know that ""alice"" is the same ""alice"" across conversations/threads because it affects the level of trust in the information provided.)",1334264746

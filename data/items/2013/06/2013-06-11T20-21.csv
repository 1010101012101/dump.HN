5864690,comment,5864427,5864577,21,0,Vivtek,,,"Essen. Anyone interested in traveling the US to experience everyday life there as an intern or an au pair should be careful with their correspondence. The staff of the immigration authorities appear to be happy to read along on social networks like Facebook. Two young women were put onto the next plane back to Germany right after landing.<p>After completing high school, Jana H. wanted to go abroad to the land of unlimited opportunity  the United States of America. She organized her own au pair exchange. Found a nice family she wanted to work for and live with for a year.
For agreed-upon daily spending money, Jana would take care of the children. At the same time, she wanted to take a language course to improve her English. She had regular contact with her host father through Facebook.<p>When the high school graduate finally landed in the US, she was taken to the side and questioned at the passport control in the airport. The officials at the American immigration agency wanted to know the reasons for her travel and how long she wanted to stay.<p>Wrong answers<p>Jana was ready for this kind of question. She wanted to visit friends of her parents and take an English course. Was she sure of that? was the next question. Yes, she was sure. Really, really sure?<p>Finally, the officials presented the astounded Jana with a print-out of the entire Facebook correspondence she had had with her host father. Their accusation: The young woman wanted to work in the States illegally. The authorities had obviously read along in Jana&#x27;s private messages on the social network Facebook for weeks. Jana was not allowed to enter. The next airplane brought the 18-year-old back to Germany.<p>It wasn&#x27;t an isolated incident. The dream of another youth of an internship on a horse ranch in the US also never came to fruition due to snooped Facebook messages  he, too, ended up right back at the airport after the flight over the pond.<p>291 words.",1370984335

Unfortunately, we did not find our critical mass and the product has since successfully pivoted into an entirely different product called LookBookHQ.<p>I do have another idea, which is to bring the concept of testing to the Excel world.<p>I think that the combination of:<p>- a framework for building up test cases that can be run against the data as part of the saving process (think rSpec)<p>- an English-like, indented grammar for defining user stories that can potentially generate code for tests (think Cucumber)<p>- a strong push for a culture of testing in the Excel community that would have to include Microsoft<p>I dunno, honestly. Could be crazy. The culture might never accept testing.<p>But then again, one of the basic ways to sell something is to give people insurance against humiliating themselves.

5864653,comment,5864427,5864558,20,0,smartician,,,"Native German speaker here. The article alleges that &quot;apparently&quot; authorities had been monitoring their private correspondence for weeks. I highly doubt that this was the case. Usually it works like this: Once you&#x27;re deemed suspicious at the passport control, you&#x27;re sent for &quot;secondary inspection&quot; to an office in the back. There, you&#x27;re being questioned further, and officials will search publicly available information for anything suspicious. This includes your Amazon wishlist [1] and in some cases searches of personal items like laptop data [2]. The most common case is when future au-pairs bring physical letters from their hosts with them, and CBO agents find them. There have been thousands of stories like this going back for decades, that&#x27;s nothing new. What&#x27;s new is the ubiquity of social media.<p>In this case, I assume the girl was stupid enough to post publicly on the wall of her future employer, and the CBO agents could easily find it and print it out. I seriously doubt that their private conversations have been monitored.

2. When you say &quot;currently ... (unique visitors)&quot; - is that uniques across the entire time period (120 seconds?) or uniques at one second? What&#x27;s the window for that calculation? 
3. I&#x27;m assuming you do NOT use Storm for uniques calculation - just a custom script/job?",1370983765

Why not push them from StatsD directly into Skyline? This would probably be more efficient. If you used incremental / online / streaming algorithms you&#x27;ll have a compact summary at each time step, so you can throw away the raw data. 250K metrics would fit in memory quite easily (we&#x27;re just talking approximately a number and a string each, right?) and you have 4000+ cycles per second to process them, which should be sufficient.<p>Python lack of good threading would possibly be a problem.

Apache Commons Math is pretty good (<a href=""http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/</a>).

Based on the description of the Posse Comitatus Act, it sounds like your interpretation would be correct. It says that Posse Comitatus (PCA) limits the federal government&#x27;s powers to use federal military personnel for domestic law enforcement.<p>My interpretation of that is that it applies to <i>military forces</i>. The Coast Guard <i>is</i> a military force. DHS, I believe, is not. The reason the Coast Guard is exempt from PCA is not due to it being under DHS. (That&#x27;s a side issue.) It&#x27;s because the Coast Guard is charged with a law enforcement mission. It says that right in the Wikipedia article.<p>And that makes sense too. PCA says &quot;don&#x27;t use military for law enforcement.&quot; US Coast Guard has a law enforcement mission, so it must have an exemption in order to fulfil that mission. Likewise, ATF and FBI are law enforcement agencies (not military forces). So it makes sense that it doesn&#x27;t apply to them as well.<p>The big question is whether DHS is a military force or not. I don&#x27;t think they are. I could be wrong.<p>If they&#x27;re not a military force, I don&#x27;t see the problem with them not being bound by the PCA. The PCA is specifically for military forces.<p>Regarding the rest of your sources, [2,3,5] seem to confirm that DHS is buying a lot of ammo. But I don&#x27;t see anything nefarious there. Note that [2] is an editorial (an opinion piece).<p>None of the sources mention that DHS is purchasing hollow-point bullets. The Snopes page [4] mentions that the SSA is purchasing hollow-point bullets, but not DHS. I wouldn&#x27;t really have a problem with it if DHS was purchasing hollow-point bullets. The reason hollow-point bullets are banned in international warfare is because they increase the likelihood that a combatant is killed rather than just maimed. A full-metal jacket bullet will maim a combatant so that he is unable to continue fighting, but with a lower chance of killing him. Police forces tend to use hollow-point bullets because they reduce the risk to innocent bystanders (less chance of going through walls or ricocheting). Different tools for different jobs.<p>Regarding the &quot;hestitate no more&quot; targets, the sources [6,7] don&#x27;t support the claim that DHS is using them. The first source [6], is an opinion piece. First, let&#x27;s apply Betteridge&#x27;s Law [<i>] to the headline. The answer is probably, &quot;No, &#x27;DHS [is probably not] training with practice targets featuring children, pregnant woman [sic].&#x27;&quot; Looking at the content of [6], all it really says is DHS buys targets from Law Enforcement Targets, Inc, and Law Enforcement Targets, Inc released a product line that features targets that display children, pregnant women, etc. It doesn&#x27;t follow from those two statements that DHS is purchasing </i>exactly* those products. They could be purchasing a different product line from the same company. The second source [7], just states that Law Enforcement Targets, Inc makes &quot;hesitate no more&quot; targets. It doesn&#x27;t mention DHS. In fact, a quote from the company says that the product was designed based on requests from <i>police</i> forces.<p>One point that you didn&#x27;t provide any sources for is the DHS practising &quot;live-fire drills in and over major cities.&quot; Does &quot;over&quot; major cities imply they have military aircraft? I&#x27;m not sure what you meant by that.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that you&#x27;re wrong, but the particular sources that you&#x27;ve chosen don&#x27;t support your conclusions. DHS isn&#x27;t my favorite government agency either, but I see no conspiracy here.<p>[*] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines</a>",1370983338

Do you have a sane theory why these were occurring?<p>Backwards compatibility and layers of indirection.<p>Microsoft has always made great efforts for backwards compatibility - Raymond Chen&#x27;s blog is a good source of stories.  Quite simply if you upgraded Windows and apps stopped working then you&#x27;d blame Windows.  Of course it is almost always the apps relying on undocumented behaviour, ignoring documentation, relying on implementation artifacts etc.  This means a lot of code to detect and work around problems in other components.  For a networked filesystem client the simplest way is sending lots of requests and picking results of interest based on what comes back.  Networked filesystem servers also work around client problems in various ways - eg they may return smaller block sizes than the client requested because it is known to have occasional problems.  All of this builds up layers and layers of workarounds, workarounds to workarounds, having to test against OS/2 etc.  SMB2 was an attempt to wipe the slate clean (no more OS/2!) but of course the crud starts building up again.<p>Explorer isn&#x27;t a program that displays files and directories despite appearances.  There are layers and layers of abstractions, parts provided by COM etc.  The code that knows it wants to display the listing of a zip file is many layers away from the code that generates network requests.

5864504,comment,5863353,5863936,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Not precisely a rebuttal (you missed my point) but an interesting point in it&#x27;s own right which I read was &quot;Can you evaluate dollar value of privacy using the dollar value of your income stream?&quot; And doing a sort of solve for X thing where you end up with hours invested in maintaining privacy becoming valued at hours invested in generating income. If I misunderstood please let me know, but assuming that I got the gist of it...<p>For me, I don&#x27;t believe there is even a piece wise approximation between time investment and privacy value because the tools are so much different and the available actions being constrained. To illustrate where I get hung up on that reasoning, if you build a phishing page setup and contract a botnet to spam few hundred million people with phone phish-spam, you might get a lot of &quot;income&quot; for a relatively small time investment, similarly you can get greatly increase your privacy by investing in forged identity documents. So at the least we would have to constrain the hours invested in legitimate ways to enhance ones privacy and legitimate ways to enhance one&#x27;s income.<p>Next there is an issue of facilitating the effort, so when company A sells me raw materials at a modest markup they facilitate my ability to make a living using them to provide said raw materials.If instead they were to charge an extortionate mark up, I might still be able to make a living but I might find the effort to do so requiring many many more hours of time investment. So at what point do the actions of my raw materials supplier work for or against my efforts at generating income. Similarly the provider of my tools can make it easier or less easy for me to maintain my privacy, so for example a Google Drive plugin which let me keep everything on their servers encrypted. If Google provides that then its a small number of hours invested to enhance my privacy, but if I have to rely on a third party who is acting without support from Google, then it takes many more hours for the same level of enhancement.<p>Given these built in and essentially intractable forces which affect the efficiency of hours invested needed to achieve the desired result, I am not persuaded by your claim that I can evaluate the &#x27;worth&#x27; of privacy using your proposed reasoning.<p>Google can, and apparently does, to things like warrant notices where if you are suddenly asked to reconfirm your acceptance of their terms of service it&#x27;s a signal that a warrant was served to them that they had to turn over your data. I think these sorts of things help them in the eyes of their users and are not illegal. They meet the letter of the law and so are not actionable, just as their transferring of rights around amongst their national subsidiaries is a completely legal way of not paying more tax.<p>My call to action was to try to think of ways that would make things like the PRISM data not useful to the NSA and yet meet their obligations under the law. I mentioned one (in cloud encryption with client side decryption) but I am sure there are others.",1370982528

Personally, I would have used radix sort, while keeping the stack size manageable. This would mean less comparisons, manageable desk space and less effort. Plus selection sort (which is very intuitive when you aren&#x27;t bound by array/list constraints) becomes really easy. 
real world example:
Before we could set down for a game of poker; more often than not, my friends and I would have to form a complete deck from the many mixed up together. While quick/merge are the fastest comparison sorts, we would prefer doing a radix sort on the suite and then selection sort until cards of the color are sorted out.

Maybe they could cover one or two of those up, but I have to think that after even just a few failed blackmail attempts, they either have a large body count or enough evidence that people decide that these reports have some fact behind them.  At that point, it seems to me to come rather quickly to two choices, public outrage that results in repeal of those acts, or total dictatorship where the public outrage is stifled and ignored.<p>It is a little different now that the secret is starting to slip out of the bag, but the end game still seems to be pretty much the same to me.  They say it is okay because they aren&#x27;t abusing the data in this manner and they won&#x27;t do it.  If they try to start abusing the data and blackmailing / recruiting, etc.  Then again, the failed attempts lead to a body count or eventually incontrovertible proof that they are abusing the power.<p>Please note that I&#x27;m not endorsing their collection or use of this data in any way.

It was by all measures a much scarier time. Obama has a few drone strikes--Reagan was funding revolutions in other countries. It was the height of the cold war and the threat of nuclear holocaust, and the palpable fear about communism paled anything we see today over terrorism. Even in the early 2000&#x27;s, in the throes of the aftermath of 9/11, the Supreme Court forced the Bush administration to dramatically adjust its policy on giving legal representation to inmates at Guantanamo.<p>Since then what has happened is a process of delegitimization of the judiciary. And both sides of the aisle have been to blame for this: from the right&#x27;s talk of activist judges to Obama&#x27;s physically menacing over the Justices during his state of the union. The judiciary has been at fault too: having overextended itself in the culture wars of the 1960&#x27;s and 1970&#x27;s, it very self-conciously adopted a mantra of extreme judicial restraint.<p>What you have left today is a judiciary that might no longer be able to effectively police the government.

5864348,comment,5862195,5862195,5,0,VonGuard,,,"Just to add some insight as to why the press is doing this. First of all, there is a legitimate reason to snoop into his personal and past life: checking for source integrity. Frankly, this should end with &quot;Did he work where he said he did, is he mentally ill, does he have an axe to grind?&quot;<p>The media has clearly gone beyond this, though. David Brooks&#x27; rather pompous style could be mistaken for going too far, but instead I think he was stepping just an inch or two over this line, while other sites and outlets are mentioning things like his lack of a high school diploma casually and without any real need or purpose.<p>At this point in the life of this story, there is little to report on that doesn&#x27;t require deep knowledge and GREAT sources. Sources are the lifeblood of journalism. Right now, there&#x27;s only one, and most of the media has had no access to him. It&#x27;s jealousy, I expect, that leads them to denigrate him now.<p>The newsroom thinking is like this, and it&#x27;s not entirely a conscious level thing: &quot;We did not break this story. We do not have anything to add to this story. We are too technically inept to comment on this story. There still exists a possibility that this whistle-blower is wrong, and that&#x27;s something we can investigate because we know his name and we have Google/LexisNexis... Well, shit, we gotta have something to fill the airwaves for 24 hours!&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re being directly controlled by the NSA, here. Outside of a few folks, like Brooks, the media is just being inept and lazy, not viscous and conspiratorial.",1370980877

All of them recruit top students from different universities. There is no &quot;university for spies&quot;, where they teach agents all the skills they need to get the job somewhere. It&#x27;s the other way around: they recruit people who already have those skills and teach them how to be agents. That&#x27;s much easier because teaching someone how to become agent is their expertise.",1370980868

Just to get it out of the way, it is a bit annoying to see a company that is normally absolutely obsessed with others copying them now doing the same. But as eyebrow raising as that is, its not really my main concern.<p><i>My</i> personal issue with this design  is that it signals the coming of a boring lull in mobile design. Its the death of distinction. Android, Windows, and iPhone now largely look the same (to me). In fact I think the Windows stuff actually looks better. Its upsetting because there are surely more than just <i>two</i> possible designs (&quot;flat&quot; or &quot;skeuomorphic&quot;). Did iOS need a design overhaul? I don&#x27;t know (I&#x27;m personally of the belief that it was missing key features and services more than a new skin). But if for the sake of argument it did, then this just frankly feels lazy on Apple&#x27;s part. It was the most obvious direction to go in, and its been done. Aqua and iOS 1 were different, fresh, and represented an original vision for UIs. Even if you didn&#x27;t like them it provided something to contrast to. This just provides something to compare to :/",1370980802

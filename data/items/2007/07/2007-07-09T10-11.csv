In this regard I fail to see a ""this isn't capable of handling real-world applications"" and instead ""it's possible that something bad could happen, so prepare for the worst yet hope for the best and know that, within reason, it's far more likely that the best scenario (i.e. your data layer remains persistent as it should) will be what actually takes place 99.9999999999% of the time.</i><p>Yeah, so as someone using EC2 + S3 for our web enterprise, I am not really worried.

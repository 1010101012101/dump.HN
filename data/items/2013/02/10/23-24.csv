Anybody had a similar experience? I know this probably means I did not get accepted, because it has been a week since my interview.Or maybe it just takes while to make a decision since they are obviously interviewing other candidates as well. Anyway, has anyone gotten accepted into App Academy?If you did, how long was the waiting process? And what was your experience at the academy like? Thank you for your replies in advance! I would really appreciate any input!",1360540795

You might not need to program per se, but you do need to know how to DEBUG and TEST your programs as well.  This is something that most people are loathe to do.  It requires a great deal of discipline, and even though in finance you're supposed to test spreadsheets during internal auditing, most auditors aren't trained in proper testing/coding, so it ends up being ad hoc.  In fact, it's scary how much intermediate financial statements are rubber-stamped/robo-signed by people in the finance, usually because they are pressed for time.",1360540775

Of course , as a geek, I had to have one. It was nightmare. Displays were unresponsive, phones were freezing etc. I end up using old keyboard-standard nokia for few years.<p>About a year ago, I have been using Galaxy for few months. The experience was much better then my first phones, but still not perfect. And then I bough my dream phone. Many of you might not know it, but its called XiaoMi (). It is chinese phone, but not some chinese garbage it is well thought-trough phone, performance much better then newest galaxy and armed with android and MIUI on top. Peope say that Xiomi company is like apple in china. I have to say I have never been so happy with phone.<p>XiaoMi now released version two of their phone. The phone has everything that first version is missing, and I am very temped to buy it, but there is a bit of fear if the phone wil let me down the same way my first phones did.

Doesn't look much like the OO polymorphism that some people are used to, but FP folks use this kind of functional polymorphism all the time.<p>That being said, the main premise of the article is quite valuable: yes, you can program with no conditionals. And i think it's quite useful to know that polymorphism can be used like that without suffering too much of an unfriendly syntax (see lmm's comment on Smalltalk: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5198419"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5198419</a>).<p>Finally, although pattern matching can be seen as an overpowered if-statement, the relation can be also turned around: the if-statement is a special case of pattern matching. I won't say that pattern matching is not conditional statements, but i think it's also quite valuable to notice that you can use pattern matching as a new programming primitive instead of the if-statement. For example, the if-statement implemented in Haskell:<p><pre><code>  if :: Bool -> a -> a -> a\n  if True  x _ = x\n  if False _ y = y\n</code></pre>\nRelying only on pattern matching instead of conditional if-statements can make quite the difference on how one reasons about programming problems (e.g. Prolog and declarative programming in general).",1360540527

In fact, they are not only possible. They are entirely consistent with data on human error rates from other work domains. The Human Error Website (Panko, 2005a) presents data from a number of empirical studies. Broadly speaking, when humans do simple mechanical tasks, such as typing, they make undetected errors in about 0.5% of all actions. When they do more complex logical activities, such as writing programs, the error rate rises to about 5%. These are not hard and fast numbers, because how finely one defines reported ""action"" will affect the error rate. However, the logical tasks used in these studies generally had about the same scope as the creation of a formula in a spreadsheet.</i><p>He has cites at his website too.<p>(<a href=""http://panko.shidler.hawaii.edu/ssr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://panko.shidler.hawaii.edu/ssr/</a>)",1360540361

[2]<p>- There's a guy on HN (Jarrod Drysdale) who produced an eBook called ""Bootstrapping Design"".  I haven't pulled the trigger on a purchase yet, but I need to.  I've read his sample chapter and am subscribed to his newsletter and I think he's an excellent coach. [3]<p>- I keep a bookmark folder called ""design inspiration"" and when I find really cool sites or apps I save them here.  You might also want to keep a clipping diary or something where you can keep notes for yourself about what you like and don't like about certain things.<p>- There's nothing wrong with imitation, within reason.  EVERYONE stands on the shoulders of giants and the guy who designed that awesome site or app probably started by shamelessly copying existing stuff.  In fact, I recommend that you spend some time trying to EXACTLY copy things you like.  You'll start to get a feel for how to accomplish certain affects and, in general, you'll get design a little more ""in the fingers"".<p>- <a href=""http://ux.stackexchange.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ux.stackexchange.com/</a><p>- Have a project.  Have a project.  HAVE A PROJECT.  It's very difficult to just ""learn design"", just as it's very difficult to just ""learn programming"".  Unless you're just a natural autodidact, you can read all the tutorials and books and whatever but, when it comes time to do something on your own, you'll just be sitting there staring at a blinking cursor (or an empty Photoshop document) unless you have <i>some place</i> to start.<p>I hope this all helps, and don't be afraid to share stuff on HN with us.

That said, your career accomplishments qualify you as 'child prodigy' in the eyes of college admissions counsellors, on the one hand, and successfully graduating with C's / D's will if anything hurt your case.<p>Get your GED.  Find a good, large community college at 16, and begin there on a part-time schedule, perhaps 12 credits a year instead of the normal 24-36.  Get straight A's or don't bother.  Now, at any time in your progress towards a ""2-year degree"" (including after graduation), you can transfer out to a big-name university and have most of your classes count.  You have an academic track record that shows you can successfully study, and an extracurricular that outweighs anyone else's.  It enables you to focus your learning, remove yourself from the often harsh social environment of high school, and put off the decision about whether you'll begin a traditional college experience for years, and <i>still</i> be ahead of the game age-wise and credibility-wise.<p>There is a reasonable chance that your business will fail entirely, or be sold profitably in the next five years, and this route provides you with long-lived options, without wasting the time you're wasting now.",1360539813

It's been an immense problem for me and it's destroyed almost all my side projects.<p>The problem is that you're interested in the wrong aspects of your side project. You're interested in learning and solving the code problems that come with your project. You have to shift your perspective to the human side of your project. You have to learn to see the user's issues as the problem to be solved.<p>Let's use an ""reviews"" site as an example. Your users cant find reviews, that annoy them. What you're solving is not a programming problem; your problem is ""make it easy for users to find reviews"". That is your problem. Your problems is not what the best algorithm for ratings. None of the code stuff matters. These users do not care about code.<p>When you've shifted your perspective to the human side you'll start to see hacky solutions differently. A crappy algorithm for ratings isn't a poor solution, it's a perfect solution. You've solved the reviews problem. You have a perfect solution.<p>The problem is that most of aren't actually excited about the human side of our side projects. This is because we get excited about things that interest us, and what interests a programmer is usually programming. It's not surprising we choose projects with interesting code problems.<p>Start reflecting on the human/sociological side of things before you choose a project. You might be surprised at what you find. Projects that seemed interesting may suddenly become dull and the one's you thought were dull might suddenly become interesting. A human perspective doesn't exclude building stuff with a code focus, just make sure coders are your audience. You and your users just need to be excited about the same things.<p>There is this classic saying about ""building something for yourself"" resulting in the best products. As with most sayings, they left out some important information. They forgot to tell to you to make sure that what you're building for yourself is the same thing you're building for your users.<p>Make your goals align with your users. Otherwise, you'll find yourself trapped down the rabbit hole.<p>Some extra thoughts<p>Don't forget that all your tricks to solve programming problems work on human problems. For example, for a reviews site it's easy to phrase the problem as ""make it easy for users to find the best reviews in the most efficient and enjoyable way possible while allowing them to simultaneously book and view and and and...."".  Break it down into it's simplest elements first, just like you would a programming problem. The simplest element of the problem is ""make it easy for users to find reviews""; best reviews are a separate problem.<p>You're probably good at solving programming problems, breaking them down and being productive. You know all the 37signals posts, all the design patterns, and can quote re-work by heart. Use those principles you have learned and apply them to the human side. Everything your learned about productive programming applies to productive life.",1360539112

5198432,comment,5196666,5198198,3,0,clicks,,,"Research says otherwise.<p><i>Recent research has begun to distinguish two aspects of subjective well-being. Emotional well-being refers to the emotional quality of an individual's everyday experiencethe frequency and intensity of experiences of joy, stress, sadness, anger, and affection that make one's life pleasant or unpleasant. Life evaluation refers to the thoughts that people have about their life when they think about it. We raise the question of whether money buys happiness, separately for these two aspects of well-being. We report an analysis of more than 450,000 responses to the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, a daily survey of 1,000 US residents conducted by the Gallup Organization. We find that emotional well-being (measured by questions about emotional experiences yesterday) and life evaluation (measured by Cantril's Self-Anchoring Scale) have different correlates. Income and education are more closely related to life evaluation, but health, care giving, loneliness, and smoking are relatively stronger predictors of daily emotions. When plotted against log income, life evaluation rises steadily. Emotional well-being also rises with log income, but there is no further progress beyond an annual income of ~$75,000. Low income exacerbates the emotional pain associated with such misfortunes as divorce, ill health, and being alone. We conclude that high income buys life satisfaction but not happiness, and that low income is associated both with low life evaluation and low emotional well-being.</i><p><a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489</a>",1360538841

When I work with excel (sometimes I still do!)

Sometimes when I have to do a different implementation I just keep the previous implementations of the same algorithm somewhere on the sheet, use the same input and substract the results - any non zero value should get you worried enough to display an error message. This is interesting for new edge cases that your test suite could miss, and especially useful if the initial algorithm was vetted in some way.<p>Congratulations - you have added regression !<p>All this is easy to do, just a copy/paste special away. Even better- you can <i>teach</i> that process to non coders and they will see how useful it is, because anyone who has used excel for non trivial things has been exposed to such problems and is weary of excel limits.<p>The tool is not the problem. Software development is a process, and if you do a poor implementation, without tests, without regression testing, guess what it will bite you - but it would be the same in C, perl or python if you try to do without <i>at least</i> tests.<p>TLDR : There are many ways to make excel more robust.

But having this codified in the EULA must give legal departments the shivers! I'm surprised there are no perf benchmarks on the web comparing Go....to anything! The last I heard they were way behind even the JVM on perf; just because they ahead of time compile doesn't give them much of a natural advantage here (since JIT compilation is not a perf problem in practice).<p>.net has value types that you can use to avoid allocations. I've used them to write GC free code before where it's necessary, like doing a physics engine. I'm not sure if this is comparable to how you are avoiding GC in Go.",1360537793

5198376,comment,5198187,5198187,149,0,breckinloggins,,,"We software guys complain about this all the time, but Excel completely permeates the corporate world because it:<p>- is universally available (who in an office building DOESN'T have an Office license?)<p>- can be ""Programmable"" to the extent that it needs to be.  You don't have to start with code.  Formulas and conditionals are great for most things.  People usually ease into Macros gently.<p>- produces a format that is sharable.  People ""fork"" Excel spreadsheets all the time.  It's not pretty but it works.<p>- gets the job done.  You want data entry with some calculations and maybe a few if-then rules here and there?  What's better than Excel?<p>In a corporate environment, often the best way to get things done is to <i>circumvent</i> the official software and just write something that works.  When <i>we</i> do it, we call it an elegant hack, but when guys in suits who went clubbing last night do it, we call it a terrible, amateur travesty that should be replaced by PROPER code as soon as possible.<p>And you know what, eventually that happens.  Very rarely, an incredibly useful Excel spreadsheet will be replaced by an even more useful (and reliable) piece of custom software that also adds tons of value to both the users and the organization.  But I've worked in corporate consulting for years; can you guess how often this happens?  I'd wager it's less than 40%.<p>No, what typically happens is that an analyst or software dev notices someone's cool spreadsheet and says ""hey, I can make something that does this job, but it'll be a LOT faster and I'll put the data up in the cloud and multiple people can access it at once and...""<p>And that sounds great, so they get a little budget and a project is born.  Most of us who have been there and done that know what happens next: higher-level stakeholders get involved, broader objectives get defined, more team members are brought on, timetables are established, results are ""metricized"", paradigms are going to be shifted, etc.<p>Rarely does a piece of software escape from this process that is as genuinely useful as the spreadsheet which spawns it.  Often, rather, it gets delivered 6 months late.  It crashes all the time.  What used to be one simple input field is now a whole page with checkboxes you have to check and sub-objects you have to define.  The end result might look a little prettier but that cool Infragistics graph is locked inside the program and can't be shared like the old Excel report because no one hooked up the ""export feature"".  People are getting upset.  Everyone hates this program.  But we have to use it, it's mandated by corporate.<p>Meanwhile, a talented new guy comes on the team and notices what a bloated piece of crap this software is.  He wonders why no one has written a little Excel sheet to get around it and REALLY get some work done...<p>I know I'm being cynical.  And look, I GET that rogue spreadsheets can turn into productivity-damaging unseen business risks.  But until the corporate ""software project"" culture understands why it happens and why people are often far happier with their clunky spreadsheet than with your shiny WPF app or web page, I don't think this problem is going to go away.",1360537653

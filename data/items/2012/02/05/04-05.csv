Isn't the essence of a business- and all startups are young business-- the mechanism that generates revenue?  And isn't selling a primary method of it?  Sales so often seems focused on selling the product that is your stock, not the product that is your business's purpose.<p>He talks about finding that feeling that your product gives.<p>I've heard this called: ""Made, Laid or Paid"".  How does your product do one of those three?<p>I also heard that Sequoia wants a 7 deadly sins slide- how your product enables one or more of those seven deadly sins.<p>Also, I think that revenue is important.  I think too many startups maybe get easy money or seek investment as their goal, and thus vanity metrics hold sway... when the better choice is revenue or ramen profitability.  When your profitable, you no longer have that clock ticking, you're a lot harder to bend over the barrel and you can be a lot more selective about from whom and under what terms you take investment.<p>Everywhere else in life, being in that position means that people want to do business with you more than they do when you <i>need</i> them.<p>I've spent too much time at too many startups where the CEO & CFO and usually one more key person were MIA for quarters, if not years at a time because they were always chasing money.",1328417866

Unfortunately, the resulting drag force was larger than he'd predicted, and after his experiments introduced a full extra day in 1893 (February 31, 1893 - google it), he was forced to stop his experiments. The original wheel is still on display in his home town of Smiljan. On special occasions, it is started up and let spin freely, without a load attached.<p>To fix the mess he made, Tesla had to use the energy he'd stored up from the wheel (in a huge bank of capacitors - creating this was such a feat that the unit for capacitance is now named in his honor) to actually drive the wheel and restore the Earth's proper rotational period.<p>Of course, the transfer wasn't without loss, which is why years divisible by 100 do not have leap days any longer.",1328417554

OK, that was a contrived, off-the-cuff example, but it gets to the point of the thing.<p><i>Sure I don't have an easy way to export my friends' data, but that is not my data--it's theirs.</i><p>That's arguable, IMO.  If I have a list of my friends phone numbers and birthdays in a pen and paper address book, would you argue that I don't have the right to copy that book, or remix / reorganize / reuse the data in it, as I want (so long as I'm not violating my friends' rights somehow in the process, like spamming them)?<p>What we need is for Facebook / G+  etc. to adopt the work being done by the Semantic Web community and the Federated Social Web XG and open the ""walled gardens.""  OR we need new platform(s) to emerge that do so, and for those platforms to supplant Facebook and the other centralized, dictatorial platforms.",1328415935

In any career where there is oppurtunity to make large sums of money there are 10,000(,000,000) other people, as smart or smarter than you, scrambling to do the same thing. If you get into a profession to make money and not due to a passionate interest in the area, you are unlikely to rise to the top no matter how clever you consider yourself to be. It is one of the great paradoxes. Some of the smartest, most talented people I know in the field (and also very likely to be in the top earning bracket) are MUCH more motivated by passion and interest in the area than paycheck. Conversly most of the people I have met that are motivated primarily by paycheck size are, honestly, a lot less talented than they believe themselves to be and not really the 'in-demand' types that would allow them leverage to get the greater paydays they seek.",1328415838

I think I've have 3 beers in my entire life, generally as the result of awkwardly forced social situations where it was easier to have a few sips than to make a bigger issue out of it than I wanted to.<p>Wine?  A glass now or then with a particular meal, it's OK.  Spirits?  Some vodka with OJ can give me a small buzz which, in some ways, can be relaxing for a while.  These are the '1-2x a year' sorts of drinks, but never really for the taste of it.<p>But... beer.  Of any sort.  I've just <i>never</i> understood the fascination with it.  It all tastes gross.  It's probably saved me a small fortune compared to some of my friends over the years, and I'm sure I'm (a bit) healthier because of it, although I still eat junk food, so it's not all unicorns and rainbows on that score :)",1328415423

3553256,comment,3553068,3553068,14,0,skulldouggery,,,"I'd respond to the author if I could but the article is from 2007 and comments are closed.<p>The author tends to cite jobs in law and finance as better routes of work. I'd disagree. Only graduated recently (2010) but I went to a T[op]14 school. I've since worked at two small law firms (personal injury and foreclosure) and also abroad as a financial analyst for a real estate division of a conglomerate in Asia. I'll try to be short about my points.<p>1. While law and finance don't necessarily suffer from the same knowledge turnover rate as programming, they do suffer typecast-inducing problems. Lateral movement among subfields is extremely difficult. This becomes a bigger problem if the first field you land in is meant to be a stepping stone.<p>2. Prestige is bullshit. I've associated with V5 lawyers and Bulge Bracket bankers. Very few of them are not socially awkward. You may hear rumors about ""models and bottles,"" but rest assured, it's mostly just bottles.<p>3. Foreignization is a growing concern for law and automation has been a huge concern for finance for a while. There are various work arounds to the rules regarding unauthorized practice of law. As for finance, there are a few small documentaries lamenting the fall of the floor trader. Guess who's been replacing them?<p>4. Management roles are nearly ubiquitous. That said, you do get escalating responsibilities in law. The problem is, will you last the grind leading up to it? A good friend of mine once messaged me while I was working abroad. It was 2a.m. in NY at the time. He told me his entire week was spent indenting, printing out, and placing into a folder a table of contents for a case. Among my friends, he's at the best law firm out of all of us.<p>5. Conditions in law and finance are part of the golden handcuffs you graduate with. They're good, no doubt, but they come at the price of lots of hours. Those who work in law are at the mercy of clients. Same could be said about finance in some areas.<p>I responded to this, not to say that a career in computer programming doesn't suck. It might. But the grass is always greener on the other side, and from where I'm standing, my lawn is looking pretty brown. I responded because I disagree with the underlying message: you are better off getting a law or finance job through a law degree or MBA. Degrees aren't measures of success and they aren't golden tickets to it either. There are pros and cons to every career path. Just have to figure out where, for you personally, the former will outweigh the latter.<p>TL;DR: law and finance sucks too. But in the end it all comes down to personal preference.",1328415330

3553242,comment,3552656,3553075,1,0,grokaholic,,,"Thank you for taking the time to share your advice. Let me see if I can summarize your main points, and reply to them under my summaries.<p>1) Think of yourself as a startup, not a freelancer preparing for a startup.<p>Agreed! I think on hacker news people get touchy if you call yourself a startup when you're really just starting consulting. However, in my mind, I see my company's product as myself, and I'm trying to create a minimum viable product this year.<p>2) Don't grok HTML/CSS or Linux, but do learn enough to get by. Do learn JS really well.<p>Point taken.<p>3) Move somewhere cheaper.<p>I might be wrong on this, but I'm determined to make it while living in SF.  Others have done it, I will too. If I am wrong, I will go back to temping, save again, and maybe consider moving to Tahiti the second time around.<p>I'm curious to know your story of starting up in SE Asia, what you did, what it was like, how things worked out.<p>4) Consider ditching Python web apps, learn PHP and how to configure CMSes like Wordpress, Drupal, etc. It's faster route to getting paid.<p>Half the people I've talked to say ""PHP + CMS!"". Half say ""Python and Framework!"". I suppose I have some time to think about this more, while I get focus on building the fundamentals of my site.<p>6) Hustle, not programming language, influences pay most. So hustle.<p>Definitely.<p>7) Consider skipping portfolio-building, start making and selling small products to turn immediate profit instead.<p>Definitely keeping that in mind. My ultimate goal is to build products anyways, but I don't yet have the confidence to trust that I can build my ideas, let alone than anyone will want them. However, I do feel like I can build little websites for people, and sell those. So that feels like a safer option. But I am keeping myself open to other approaches, my plan is merely an outline and a starting point. I'm sure as I become more proficient, I'll start seeing product ideas within my means to execute that might be worth risking a little time to build.<p>8) Be flexible and creative with business models e.g. consider outsourcing.<p>I understand what risks I'm comfortable taking, and which I'm not. I'll only feel comfortable outsourcing work that I can do myself. That way I can take responsibility in case the work isn't done correctly, by fixing it myself, esp when there isn't money to hire someone to fix the mistake for me. But that is a quibble. There would be situations where such an arrangement could work out, and I agree with the spirit of what you're saying.<p>9) Consider joining a web dev shop<p>That's an interesting suggestion. Would a web dev shop would take someone without a portfolio? Honest question, I've never tried to join one.<p>There are temp agencies in SF that specialize in placing web developers. I've considered going to my current temp agency later this year, and asking them to place me in whatever work they can find, on the basis of my fledgling portfolio. Not the same as joining a web dev shop, but similar idea of joining an agency that finds clients and matches my skills to projects in exchange for a cut.<p>Thanks again for all your advice, I really appreciate you taking the time.",1328414574

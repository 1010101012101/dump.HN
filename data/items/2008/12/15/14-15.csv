It sounds silly in a single example like this, but it works OK as he builds it up over a book. I suppose anyone applying to a position is pretty familiar with his works.<p>Oh, and Tribes needed <i>way</i> more than one sentence in the acknowledgements mentioning Here Comes Everybody by Clay Shirky. I'd just reread HCE before I picked up Tribes and I kept waiting to see something like ""So, every example in the last three chapters and next two chapters came from this excellent book...

If you get accepted, don't forget to bring your lunch money and cab fare as well.<p>While this sounds like a revolutionary idea, if you're willing to work for free, and can sell yourself well (the two basic acceptance criteria for this program), there is a high probably you can weasel yourself into some simialr position a number of different places.",1229352555

I think Seth is a great motivational speaker and writer, but there are far more people I'd want to give up 6 months with no pay to be mentored by from an entrepreneurial standpoint.<p>Not to mention, I was pretty turned off from the whole thing the moment I read the internship he was offering. It all seemed a little self-serving (with kool-aid), and I get a little sick of MBA guys knocking MBA programs. Seems like a shallow self-marketing gimmick...<p>(His blog is on my reader)",1229352495

398360,comment,398320,398320,0,0,smoody,,,"Absolutely true store: I once knew a professional hatchet man (a person spineless companies hire to fire large numbers of employees -- usually to fire an entire building of people). He told me once that he was part of a team that had to fire everyone working at an office building that held two-to-three hundred people from the looks of it. They were doing a lot of secretive work, so it was important that both everyone find out at the same time and security guards must escort them to their desks -- both measures to prevent anyone stealing documents or information of any kind.<p>So here's what they did: They pulled one of the fire alarms. Everyone, thinking it was a fire or drill, exited the building. Then this man, from inside the building, put a bullhorn to his mouth and said ""Attention! This is not a drill! You're all fired!"" (thinking, of course, that it was a clever play on words). They then let people back in one by one to collect their personal items and that was that.",1229352203

5446847,comment,5446648,5446659,1,0,cup,,,"If you find that interesting you might also consider reading into the controversial use of khat in the middle east.<p>For those that don't know, Khat is a leaf which releases an amphetamine like product when chewed. Traditionally scholars would consume it to help them stay up at night and pray or study however, like all good things, its beneficial uses gave way to its degenerative abuses.<p>Now Khat is considered Haram (banned from an Islam legal perspective), because its misuse over rides any benefit. Its sad to see some countries though (Yemen, Somalia) have not been able to overcome the addictive and economically lucrative product. Large swathes of Yemen for instance grow the product, which means large aquifiers are redirected primarily to this crop, depriving others from growing staples and other produce. This in turn contributes to a lack of food within the country, resulting in reduced health (particularly in young children). The other knock on effect is that once peopel start chewing it (around lunch time) the whole city shuts down. Someone should really do a case study on it.<p>Marijuana is also another interesting psychostimulant with a (tenuous) link to Islam. The original assassins (Hashashins), though considered an extreme sect with barely any resemblance to traditional Islamic orthodoxy, relied on Marijuana to produce what we know term assassins!",1364342383

If not, start building it.<p>Once you're there you need to find work. Working fast food? That's cash. That's not equity somewhere, that's immediate rent paying and food buying cash. You want this.<p>When you're not flipping burgers, try and find work that is at your technical level. Startups, firms, etc. You probably won't find any at the get go. That's fine.

Those hypothetical programmers would have lacked any common mathematical language with which to talk about computation and thus, lacked an abstract model of computation entirely.  They would have been able to program particular machines to some degree but, unless someone was spurred on to replicate the work that Church/Turing/etc decades earlier (in fact, their work would undoubtedly be pre-performed out of necessity), they would lack a solid abstract model of <i>what computation is</i> and what is necessary for it.  Until that theoretical work would be done, all of those programmers would just be taking wild stabs in the dark with ad hoc methods and superstition spawning intuition.  Engineers without Newtonian physics, no common language beyond punchcards and common english.  They could build great bridges sure, but lacking any semblance of a formal notion of computation they would be crippled compared to what they could be.  They would be at a distinct disadvantage.<p>Hell, half the reason they couldn't <i>build</i> the thing is because they lacked the theoretical background that would have put it within their grasp.  With no switching theory, without the insight of Shannon, the machine was to be an unwieldy system of gears.  It is hard for the modern mind to fully internalize just how much framework they were lacking.<p>The extent to which the standard HN <i>""formal CS educations are worthless""</i> battle cry is true is only the extent to which we benefit from those who came before us.",1364341347

I'm really tech savvy (no degree unfortunately; money took care of that one for me; I seriously tried and tried and tried.)and i'm an aspiring programmer and producer/audio engineer and I can't find work ANYWHERE. I live in a town called Yakima, WA. and all it consists of is fast food chains, big box retail stores and the extreme use of drugs. I've tried over and over again to find a job and save some money so I can move or get out of this hell hole; but to no avail have I come closer to what I want.  To just be O.K. for once.

5446621,comment,5445029,5446293,3,0,ANTSANTS,,,"Agreed, to me it seems that something like this has the potential to become the ""Bandcamp for games.""<p>Steam, even with Greenlight, is intended to host a curated selection of games. That is part of (or at least it traditionally was) Steam's value to consumers, but it has the side-effect of introducing bias against small, rapidly-developed, prototypical or otherwise less-polished games.<p>Here's a niche: Some people make neat game prototypes for competitions like Ludum Dare with a surprising amount of potential. Not everyone can afford to quit their job to turn their prototype into a well-polished product that can succeed on a popular app store or be crowdfunded (nor is every idea mainstream or even good enough to warrant that), but they are probably capable of at least cleaning up their prototype a bit and adding a decent set of levels or other content.<p>If someone makes a generic but fun game for Ludum Dare (say, a pixelated-platformer with a gimmick), I'd probably be willing to toss them a few bucks, mostly out of good will, for a more-polished but still quickly and cheaply developed successor. Whether they use that money towards developing an iteration that can succeed on a popular crowdfunding site (which are being quickly taken over by marketing experts) or as pocket change is fine with me.<p>This use case could be even more well supported by a Bandcamp-like donation system (which is what ""pay what you like, or nothing at all if you are aware that you are allowed to enter $0"" effectively is).<p>I'll end my reply by wondering aloud if a new generation of freeware games would ever be viable -- high-quality niche games released for free (and possibly open-sourced), and supported by a no-strings-attached donation scheme.",1364338888

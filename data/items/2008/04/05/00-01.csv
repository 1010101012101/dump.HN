The company is getting ready to sell their first product, and he told me that his plan is to try working for them for eight weeks and see if they can actually sell their product. If not, he's planning to quit. He's been totally up-front about this with the founders and they're ok with that. So a creative strategy like that might work.",1207356693

The Ford analogy breaks down because Ford sold cars profitably by innovatively reducing costs (which I assume he would have no problem with).<p>For the record, I don't agree with him either.

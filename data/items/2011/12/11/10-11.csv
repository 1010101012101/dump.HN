The US has some serious immigration problems right now and it's a fact of political life in this country that getting them worked out quickly is not going to happen.  We have a fractured government (not just the two parties holding different reins of power) and a screwed up lobbying system.  You are exactly the kind of immigrants we as a nation want, but there is an incredibly shrill minority that shouts down <i>anything</i> that's immigration-related when it looks like that change could benefit ""them durn illegalz"" who are already here.  This article is about trying to get some sort of change through quickly that would allow people who are going to provide direct investment into our country.  The price tag puts it out of reach of all but ""business people,"" so the screeching fringe will probably keep its mouth shut.<p>Unfortunately, this is the system US citizens have right now and, for my compatriots who agree with me and would like to see you on a plane tomorrow, ready to study here, graduate, be inspired by, and enrich our society, I am truly sorry we couldn't get the change done in time for you.

A hot dog - even a vegetarian hot dog - only costs a fraction of what a place like Drew's charges.<p>As others have pointed out, a GroupOn deal is usually going to be half off the normal price, and they take half of that, leaving 25% for the retailer.  That actually is going to cover most (or for some places, all) of cost of the food.<p>Apparently, Drew's charged $3.69 for a basic beef hotdog (Applegate brand).  You can buy them retail for maybe $0.70 each, which is less than 20% the total cost.  The bun and condiments are negligible; if Drew's could avoid hiring too many extra staff to handle the GroupOn rush, and if the GroupOn customers were mostly new, and not all regular customers looking for a bargain (both big assumptions) they probably just about broke even on the deal, even getting only 25% of normal revenue per hotdog.  Blaming GroupOn is tempting, and it might even be the straw that broke the camel's back, but it's not very plausible.",1323600702

And I can totally relate to Sebastian here. In bureaucracies it is modus operandi for people in the top to count on fear and ""decency"" of people beneath them to not call out their bullshit.<p>In a court nobody can afford to comment on the emperors lack of clothes, since they are dependent on the system. But when an outsider comes as Sebastian did in this case - they have no power over him and this outsider has two options. He can walk away and solve his problem for himself - or he can call out the BS (risking some of his reputation on one end). Why? Because he is free of the influence of the court, thats what freedom means. You can be free as soon as you realize that you can do without the system, that you can forge your own system. You don't even need to be an outsider, just realize that freedom of mind is the ultimate freedom and that it cannot be taken away. You can have your body's freedom taken away, you can even get killed. But the freedom of the mind is the ultimate drug, the ultimate intoxication and the ultimate asset. And nobody can take it away.<p>Like he said, it is about treating people the way they want to be treated. It is also a winning strategy for an iterated prisoners dilemma - you offer cooperation, if they refuse - strike them into the ground.<p>What happened was that he ""offered to save"" the publishing industry, he has been around the block, seen other industries - but what he got in response was basically a ""STFU NOOB!"".<p>His response was pretty close as to what I would have done. When somebody wants to push me around with low blows, I get really upset. Especially if I am smarter and better prepared than they are. So if they want a dirty game - I will give them a dirty game. Hell I will show them state of the art in dirty.<p>And thats what Sebastian did.<p>Kudos to you Mr. Marshall!<p>p.s.: There is a lot of mental illness in the whole story, but Sebastian is not the one ill.

At first glance it seems like a eureka-moment flash of purity, but the practical realities of it are pretty horrible.<p>For any change to the page more complex than tweaking copy or maybe changing an element (a ul to an ol for example) you'll have to update both the HTML and the DOM manipulation code - killing your separation of concerns.<p>Even worse, you have to have a complete understanding of how what the DOM manipulation code does before you can edit any of the HTML at all - otherwise you might accidentally kill the page by changing the order of two seemingly unimportant elements, or deleting an unused div.<p>You'll also be forced to make all sorts of compromises in your markup to accommodate the templating layer, which will drive your front-end engineers crazy.<p>Finally, there are extremely useful aspects of regular template languages (like template inheritance and includes) which don't map at all neatly to a DOM manipulation engine - so you'll probably have to compromise on those and end up inventing your own weird attribute-driven template engine.<p>I'd suggest approaching this idea with caution.

3339808,comment,3339291,3339695,2,0,einhverfr,,,"ars:  I don't know if we have reached max depth or if it is just a waiting period.  The major issues are:<p>1)  Testability.  you can write test cases against a stored proc. You cannot write test cases against a SQL query embedded in the middle of a function in another programming language.<p>2)  Single point of control.  You can have one function that runs the stored proc there and check properly for SQL injection, ensuring that everything is free of SQL injection as far as front-to-backend is concerned (and in Pg, that only leaves SQL injection issues in dynamic SQL which can be searched for and audited separately).<p>So that's why not to put it there.<p>As to changing the query....  I only use databases which come with transactional DDL so that's not an issue as long as inputs and outputs don't change.  If the inputs and outputs have to change, we can handle that too with transactional DDL and the fact that we make the interfaces discoverable.  In this case, we'd<p>BEGIN;<p>DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS foo_bar(...);<p>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION foo_bar(...)...;<p>COMMENT ON FUNCTION foo_bar(...) IS $$...$$;<p>COMMIT;<p>Because of the way Pg works this shouldn't really cause issues for currently running queries.<p>As for finding the right function, since these are all called on a declarative interface so you know what the function name is quickly, and so it is a matter of quickly finding it in a directory of SQL files.<p>As for testability, don't underrate this.  You can insert data, run your tests, and roll back.  So for example for our 1099-MISC and INT handling, we run more than 40 tests on a pre-written data set that we can run without ever committing to production and which will never conflict with production data (and therefore does not lock other users out).  That's approx. 20 tests per sproc there.",1323599896

3339789,comment,3339291,3339760,1,0,dools,,,"These are great points, and I certainly agree that some convention is required in template development to ensure ""less brittleness"". I think it's simple enough to do this with ids and classes, though, and even when it <i>does</i> break, the time it takes to fix it is going to have a pretty trivial impact on your overall project because the problem is solvable, quite simply and without much hunting around, by one person without the need to communicate with anyone else on the team.<p>Regarding the logic issue, I don't think you'd realistically end up with an intractable number of logic variations. If you have extra links that are there when the moderator is logged in, they should be there in any template with that structural element in it and then removed if the person logged in isn't a moderator.<p>Granted, though, I have to put my money where my mouth is and port one of my existing applications over to using this methodology (which is, in fact, what I plan to do so the proof the pudding will be in the eating).<p>Regarding the issue of ""viewing the template without a server"" - in the case of Fragmentify, all the frontend dev needs is the standard apache/php that ships with OSX. This is considerably less complex than having an entire framework/application environment installed and kept current.

I just think that there are plenty of cases where generating high quality printed content or the like doesn't work with it and templating is a lot cleaner in those environments.  And when your application already requires templating for a reason like that, adding an entirely different way of handling another output format adds needless complexity.<p>One of the useful applications of dools' ideas is that you could have a mockup which included lorem ipsums or other dummy text.

I was originally considering moving to the US for my postgraduate studies, however, after speaking with peers I decided against it, as other countries that offer far more favorable visa terms exist. Currently, my leading option is New Zealand, bundled with their student visa is a permit to work 20 hours a week, and a year's residency after the completion of your program among other things.<p>While some of you may not view New Zealand with the admiration that you view the US, as its tech-scene isn't quite as developed. It is a beautiful country nonetheless, free healthcare is available for all residents and citizens, not to mention the all around natural beauty of it.<p>Don't get the wrong impression, there is no doubt that the US is a great place, but it isn't without its problems. I'm not trying to sell you on NZ, the point I'm trying to make is why should I have to bust my balls and save up $100k for a green card when I can have more lenient and reasonable terms in another country with an emerging tech scene?<p>Note: it is probably easier for entrepreneurs to supply $100K for a green card, however, I intentionally ignored that circumstance as they're a minority amongst immigrants and chose to discuss immigration to the US in general.<p>Bottomline: America unknowingly abuses and doesn't treat immigrants with the respect that they deserve, they contribute equally to the economy as any other demographic (if not more), and are a major part of high tech industries,  and therefore, of the US economy.",1323598196

3339760,comment,3339291,3339291,6,0,judofyr,,,"I've talked about ""template animation"" (or ""mockup-driven development"" as I've called it) before, but focused mostly on how to achieve static files that can easily be opened in the browser (without any server components) and still be modular (layouts/partials): <a href=""http://timelessrepo.com/mockup-driven-development"" rel=""nofollow"">http://timelessrepo.com/mockup-driven-development</a><p>This article seems to solve modularity by splitting it out into different files. On the same page you can have dozens of modules that can have several different states;how are you supposed to combine them all? How do you say ""this page contains a sidebar, a blog post, comment section"" and that there should be a ""new comment""-form if the user is logged in and ""delete""-links if the user is a moderator? In the example in the article, it seems that would be solved by having blog_post.html, blog_post_logged_in.html and blog_post_moderator.html, where 90% of the content in the files are duplicated.<p>Beside, in the example templates you can't actually open the templates in a browser (because it only contains the content, not the stylesheets, script-tags etc. that you need). So if the designer wants to see how it actually looks, he still needs a server that can wrap the layout around it.<p>Okay, but maybe you don't need the ""view this template without running the server""-requirement. I'd still argue that dools' current approach is brittle. The reason is that he's now tying together two layers (the template layer and the animation layer) and there's no easy way to see what the animation layer will actually do. This means that small changes in the template might invalidate the animation. You really don't want to re-write the animation just because the designer switched from <h3> to <h2>.<p>This problem is easily solvable though: Use custom attributes which doesn't conflict with HTML/CSS:<p><pre><code>    <form>\n      <dl class=""error"" id=""whatevsError"" animate=""error"">\n        <dt>You have to do something about this</dt>\n        <dd>The reason we ask you do do this is so that we can laugh all the way to the bank</dd>\n      </dl>\n      <dl>\n        <dt><label for=""whatevs"">Whatevs:</label></dt>\n        <dd><input type=""text"" name=""whatevs"" id=""whatevs"" /></dd>\n      </dl>\n    </form>\n</code></pre>\nHowever, as you're adding more features to these attributes, you'll actually end up with <i>another template language</i>; it just happens to be encoded in HTML/XML. From here on we might wondering, why should we ""hide"" the logic inside attributes (where it can be easy to miss) when we can use a more distinctive and effective syntax?<p>To summarize:<p>- If you want to separate the template and the animation (so that you can easily change the template without updating the animation) you need to stay away from HTML/CSS-semantics and use custom attributes/tags that you know won't conflict.<p>- If you use custom attributes/tags you've essentially created another language which deals with the logic for you.<p>- If you don't care about the ""view the templates without running a server"", you might as well use a completely different syntax (which probably is going to be easier to understand than the ""hide everything in the DOM""-approach).",1323598037

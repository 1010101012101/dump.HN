547304,comment,547016,547143,0,0,nx,,,"I'd argue that ""PC"" has two meanings then. I'm going for ""non-Mac PC"", since that's what the title implies by separating Macs from the rest of PCs, and because I don't feel sensitive to exclude a huge set of possibilities.",1238932627
547303,comment,546924,546989,0,0,jlees,,,"As a sweeping generalisation, I find people of our generation (assuming we're all young twentysomething hackers, mostly) far less informed on what you should be paying for these sorts of services than our parents. Of course, it doesn't help that a lot of us are happy to throw money at the problem as long as the prices aren't too unreasonable.",1238932439
547302,comment,547079,547290,0,0,froo,,,"I think really the best thing you can do is listen to your users, keep your fingers on the pulse of your site and then act accordingly.<p>In my case, I didn't create the rivalry, I simply listened to what the readers were saying and the discussion happening on other sites and reacted accordingly.<p>It's much easier to ride a wave than it is to create that wave.<p>Sidenote: There were a few negative effects of my antics, but I turned those lemons into lemonade. The people in the IRC channel at the time got a real kick out of what I was doing.<p>It ended up in the sites comments being spammed a little by Tokio Hotel fans in a short couple hour window, which luckily I noticed it as it was happening.<p>I actually found much joy when I noticed this occurring in realtime and redirected those particular people to a rickroll on YouTube using a 301 redirect for those specific IP's in the .htaccess file.<p>Actually the best use of this tactic (specific IP redirects) was to a certain Tokio Hotel fan/critic named Claire (admin of a TH fansite) who left a very nasty comment on the site. I simply set up a redirect for her IP to a subdomain on the site and a page I set up specifically for her in minutes.<p><a href=""http://hacked.bestactever.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hacked.bestactever.com/</a><p>She was very upset thinking I had somehow ""hacked"" her computer and had emailed me with all sorts of threats and many four letter words.<p>The site's users got a huge kick out of that. It was childish yes, but that's what the site required at the time. Stupid childish antics. It added to the site's notoriety and was free - word spread around about the antics and traffic increased as a result.",1238932141
547301,comment,547053,547289,0,0,shiro,,,"It may be a double-edged sword.  You can take advantage of that human nature.  Encouraging employees to write books on the relevant fields may benefit the company---it can be a nice PR of the company's technology level, it can attract good people to join the company, and if the company's competitive field is a niche, more books may expand the customer base.",1238932113

547289,comment,547053,547053,0,0,Tichy,,,"Joel also writes about measuring distorting results in some of his articles. Just thinking: if a scale is public, wouldn't people scramble to just match the criteria of the scale? For example, supposed somebody is considered ""expert"" if he has written a book about the subject. So wouldn't people try to somehow write books about things, which would take away a lot of their time and energy that they might otherwise have invested in their job directly?",1238930972
547288,comment,547256,547256,0,0,halo,,,"Having a quick read of the documentation, Ext Core 3.0 is very similar to jQuery, except no-one uses it, its syntax is uglier (i.e. the distinction between Ext.get vs Ext.fly is problematic, the weird inclusion and naming of Ext.radioClass for something you can do in 2 lines of code), it adds a hodgepodge of dubious ""object oriented"" features, and randomly extends a few built-in objects via prototypes (or 'JavaScript Augmentation') something which is generally considered a bad idea.<p>The idea that people should choose this above jQuery because one day they may shell out the money on a proprietary JavaScript library is crazy, especially as so few people on the web are doing RIA stuff to begin with. There's simply no reason to use it unless you're relying on ExtJS anyway, especially as most web developers already knows and uses the simple jQuery syntax.",1238930969

If they can't, then the law in the US is really quite ill-suited for online businesses. Perhaps they should look for their hosting needs in other countries.",1238929749

He was also very involved in the audio animatronics for Disneyworld creating the robotic Abe Lincoln driven by magnetic tape. and the multi-plane camera was an amazing invention for its time (the shots still hold up too). I was just surprised about the trains because even with those inventions you mentioned he was the ""idea"" man and the quality control czar. With the trains he was actually turning the handle on the mill. Great comments, and thanks for the links!",1238929348

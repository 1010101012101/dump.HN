2095945,comment,2095081,2095300,0,0,andrest,,,"This is the point the article seems to make. The difference between a good candidate and an excellent one is huge. Like it was mentioned before, a good programmer can do in a day what a team of mediocre programmers can do in a week.<p>You say that companies should train mediocre programmers to be excellent programmers. This is not as straight-forward as it sounds, (a) the mediocre programmers might have already reached the limit of their capability (i.e no matter how much time they'll spend learning, the improvements will only be marginal), (b) it could take long time and as we all know, time is money.<p>I like to think of it as a simple exponential graph. Programming Skill on X-axis vs Time Spent Learning on Y-axis. In the beginning the progress will be fast for everybody, but at some point the progress will slow down indefinitely (i.e you've reached your maximum capacity). The point at which this will happen varies from person to person and there is unfortunately no way you can determine where that is. The only hint of the maximum capacity you can get is to compare how long the guy has been programming for and how skilled he is at given time.<p>As a result, it is more cost-effective to search for very good candidates for longer than to take handful on mediocre ones, take the risks, and train them.<p>It should be noted that a programming is without exceptions self-thought. Therefore there is no need for training per se, you will just need to take your time and do it yourself, as programming can not be taught, it can only be learned.",1294836385

2095942,comment,2095081,2095081,0,0,Unosolo,,,"What I can see is that most companies and especially these where software developement is viewed as a necessary evil rather than a business model are very bad at telling bad candidates from the good ones and don't really hire based on merit. They might believe they do, but the outcome of the hiring process is usually erratic as far as it comes to the actual abilities.<p>However once a developer is hired even a company with a flaky interviewing process tends to recognise the actual worth of a given programmer fairly quickly. Then an intresting thing happens - even though the developers might be explicitly treated as a commodity resource the very same managers would go far beyond the declared rules to retain the best: regularly up the package, give a lot of slack, turn a blind eye on minor ""breaches of established rules"".<p>As a result most good programmers I know after about five years in the industry end up enjoying a package far in excess of what is being declared on the job sites.<p>It's not uncommon for a hiring manager to moan about the lack of good candidates whilst paying the best developers on their team 50% more than they advertise when publishing the same job. What the management don't seem to realise is that just about every other company does that: actually paying more to the existing programmers than the declared range they would be prepared to pay for the new hires.<p>As a result after a while there is little or no incentive for good developers to put their CV's on a market. They're well above the market rates.<p>As a workaround sometimes companies hire good programmers as independent contractors and carry on extending the contracts forever - paying double or triple the rate they would pay their permanent staff. It's a funny game when becoming ""an independent"" consultant with a single customer is one of the few options for an experienced developer to help company management justify paying them the true market worth.<p>There is no lack of good programmers, they just cost much more than most companies are prepared to admit.",1294836343

In a word, they are too competitive and naieve to make it happen.<p>IT employees in general could double their average salaries without resorting to labour laws just by starting voluntary unions and doing a modicum of collective bargaining.<p>Instead they allow themselves to be divided and conquered and they even hide their salaries from co-workers which benefits no one aside from management.<p>Ideologically, I am against government-enforced unions.<p>However I am very much in favour of voluntary unions and there is lots of evidence that they can work especially when they behave in reasonable ways that don't threaten the existence of companies. Some corporations will prefer to hire from unions for a variety of reasons including less variability in work quality and higher morale.<p>Anyway collective bargaining does not have to be enforced in law to be effective.<p>The real issue is that the most talented and resourceful people in society tend to be the ones who become owners, and they use their talent and influence to convince IT employees that unions are bad.<p>The average programmer is stubbornly anti-union for no logical reason - the reason is that he's brainwashed by the strong opinions of industry leaders who don't want to pay him what he's worth.",1294836207

The decline of the company took more than a year, in which time salaries were cut, sometimes pay was delayed for months or not given at all, the owners were visibly transferring their personal wealth abroad (as well as moving their family members). This engineer stayed at the company, despite some good offers from elsewhere, to the point when heating was cut off from the company and he had to sit in office in winter jacket, and in the last weeks he brought printing paper from home. Finally the company went bankrupt and he took the earlier job offer at a salary lower than what was offered before.<p>Morale: watch out for signs of Stockholm syndrome, because it can be real.",1294835279

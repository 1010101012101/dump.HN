1926937,comment,1926734,1926734,0,0,bruceboughton,,,"That the author suggests that, since the iPad has a landscape homescreen, this could just be enabled for iPhone shows a lack of appreciation of Apple's design sensibilities that pervades this article. Just because the iPad has it doesn't mean it doesn't need designing for the iPhone.<p>Furthermore, the iPhone is primarily a portrait device. The iPad, not fitting easily in one hand, is as much a landscape device as it is a portrait one. I'd be surprised if Apple ""enabled"" a landscape home screen for iPhone in iOS 5.",1290340796

1926932,comment,1926515,1926740,0,0,psyklic,,,"Yes, it is really cheating. A publisher's test bank is very clearly not made for students to study from. The publishers warn students not to read them and try to make them inaccessible. In my experience, the professor almost always tells students what they can use to study from. Whether students can use past exams is almost always clarified - I wonder if a student asked in this case.<p>However, here the instructor has no way of knowing who cheated. He clearly made a mistake, knowing that using a test bank would make it easy to cheat. So, he should either let all the grades stand or he should point out the statistical anomaly and just make everyone take a new exam, which he did. I can't possibly see how students who didn't confess will be found out, especially if the exam was multiple choice!",1290340528

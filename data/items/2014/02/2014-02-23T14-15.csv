I doubt Facebook was going to teach you how to optimize your campaign in order to spend less money than you would.<p>Facebook has been aggressively trying to ramp up revenues, a personal touch is a good way to do that. It sounds like he had a number of highly popular Facebook pages and was likely contacted to come in for some in person training to get to his pages to the next level. If anything that offer is just a testament to his pre-existing success on Facebook, they would lose a lot of money if they invited everyone to the office.<p>I&#x27;ve been with Google AdSense for a long time and from time to time I get pitches about going to training or having phone conferences to help optimize more, I have to imagine this is similar.

I doubt Facebook was going to teach you how to optimize your campaign in order to spend less money than you would.<p>As stories like these continue to pop up, it is important that FB take action to protect their brand. \nHow about simply refine the target audience for ads?  for instance, in order for a user to be served ad; you must have a minimum number of friends, say 50, you must have a minimum number of say 3 pictures of yourself,  you must have a reasonable level of activity on the site for over the last X period whether 3, 4 or 5 month period.<p>A combination of such measures in some ways will clearly weed out most of the fake account and honestly even if  there is a genuine account who doesn&#x27;t match any of these criteria, then it&#x27;s obvious they aren&#x27;t even engaged on the site, so why ruin the experience further for them with ads?<p>Ultimately, FB&#x27;s objective is to please advertisers and the natural flow is that they will end up pleasing shareholders. But focusing of the hard accounting numbers in the short term at the expense of goodwill of the marketers paying your bills is simply suicide. Once a significant number of advertisers distrust the platform and stop spending on it, its&#x27; 1.2 billion users will mean nothing and that is where the shareholders will start dumping them for the next  company.",1393166150

7285922,comment,7285522,7285892,2,0,roryokane,,,"It seems that bcrypt does not specify that salts are randomly generated, but it does specify that the salt is stored with the hash. The “Bcrypt Algorithm” section of the paper at <a href=""https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/usenix99/provos/provos_html/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedin...</a> shows salts to be an input to the algorithm, and also describes them being concatenated with the hash. Random generation of the salt must be just a de-facto standard for bcrypt APIs. It’s true that that feature is orthogonal to the hashing function, and so libraries for other hashing algorithms could easily copy it.",1393164505

7285905,comment,7283656,7285599,2,0,spindritf,,,"Hard to say, obviously. Not unlikely though the answer is no. See for education for example.<p><i>Recent reports suggest a causal relationship between education and IQ, which has implications for cognitive development and aging—education may improve cognitive reserve. In two longitudinal cohorts, we tested the association between education and lifetime cognitive change. We then tested whether education is linked to improved scores on processing-speed variables such as reaction time, which are associated with both IQ and longevity. Controlling for childhood IQ score, we found that education was positively associated with IQ at ages 79 (Sample 1) and 70 (Sample 2), and more strongly for participants with lower initial IQ scores. Education, however, showed no significant association with processing speed, measured at ages 83 and 70. Increased education may enhance important later life cognitive capacities, but does not appear to improve more fundamental aspects of cognitive processing.</i>[1]<p>What you can improve is your test scores.

That policy then influenced what actually happened<p>No. The author's point is that the model used to predict climate change was terribly broken. Scientists told Nixon ""if CO2 goes up by X in the next 30 years, average temperatures will go up by Y"". That hypothesis is now  testable, because we can look at CO2 and temperatures over the predicted time span.<p>Anything else the EPA may or may not have done has no bearing.",1278187133

The consulting business is worth very little, I think you're right to view it as ""selling a job"".  Take it out of the equation for now.  You have $25k - $35k in passive product-based income.  That's your sellable asset.<p>So what's it worth?  Three years of demonstrated profit would probably be a fair selling price.  Based on that you're looking at about $75k pretax.  Why do that when you can just sit on it for three years, realize the profit, and still have a business that generates income?<p>If you don't want to do any more consulting work but have recurring business coming in, consider finding a trusted developer who can assume your clients and will pay you a commission on future billings.",1278187069

1484315,comment,1483328,1484058,0,0,danielford,,,"Yeah, I haven't wanted to reach through the internet and smack so many people since the last time I read the comments for a YouTube video.<p>I suppose they deserve to know why they're wrong though.  For starters the article isn't saying anything beyond the fact that there are people who buy used PCR machines and run reactions in their basement.  Now, I think that's pretty cool, but nothing meaningful is going to come of it.  There are a few reasons for this:<p>1) Biological Research Is Expensive - Setting up a real lab so you can do the basic stuff like running gels and western blots is going to cost somewhere around $100,000.  Note that this isn't like buying a computer where once you pay for it you're set.  Actually performing an experiment can cost hundreds of dollars for reagents alone.<p>2) Biological Research Requires Oversight -  If you're going to work with radioisotopes, or toxic chemicals, or animals you need permits that are not offered outside of an academic or industrial setting.  Two of the basic techniques of molecular biology, northern blots and southern blots, use radioactive reagents.  I'll grant that there are alternatives that use fluorescence, but they're expensive, and aren't widely used.<p>3) Biological Research Is Tedious and Slow - I think part of the reason computers took off so quickly is that you can run a program and get quick feedback on whether or not it worked.  Most of biological research is not like that.  In graduate school I worked on genetic modifications that hypothetically extended the life spans of fruit flies.  In order to see if a modification worked, I had to assay their life span over a hundred days.  I'd normally be incredibly excited about getting the result on day one, but by day forty my interest was mostly exhausted.  Biology doesn't give you the instant thrill of knowing a piece of code worked, which is one of the reasons it's not going to take off like personal computers did.<p>I'm not going to single anyone out, but if you've been making comments in this thread there's a high probability you have no idea what you're talking about.",1278186346

If your careful, you can continually buy stocks when the're at a low and sell at a high. Here's some guidelines for doing this:<p>buy stocks only from the large stable companies, because they pretty much never do radical or unpredictable ups or downs. The're are also the most liquid so you can buy or sell them pretty much instantaneously any time.<p>Buy the stock when you see the markets moving up, and sell the stocks quickly, before it goes back down. Don't try to sell at the peak because it's almost impossible to know that point. Quit while your ahead.<p>If the stocks goes down just sell it right away to minimize your loss. if you always do this you won't run the risk of significant losses, but you will have modest gains, which will add up in the long run.",1278185903

1484308,story,,,53,135,aditya42,"Ask HN: Has iOS irrevocably fallen behind?",,"There is no good place to ask this, since there are loyalists on both sides. I can only hope that Hacker News has enough sane-minded people who will answer this properly (if it gets upvoted enough to show up on the front-page, of course).<p>After watching the complete Google I/O keynote and WWDC '10 keynote, even I have to admit that Android (Froyo) has left iOS behind on features. Articles like [these][1] might say that Apple has given a solid reply, but I don't think they have. When I see features like Android's cloud-to-phone messaging APIs, I long for them to be in iOS. But then iOS 4 has nothing of this sort. Froyo also has APIs to make app data searchable, which iOS 4 doesn't for non-Apple apps. And these are just a few things that looking back at it now makes iOS 4 just seem so much weaker. Gingerbread will be out in October if I believe Engadget, and that will pull Android further away from iOS. People can talk about fragmentation — which will become less of an issue with Gingerbread, and the fact that users don't care about such features. But developers do. If Apple falls behind on features that developers want, the App Store numbers they like to tout to loudly will stop growing so rapidly.<p>To be honest, as a user, iOS 4 adds nothing that truly stands out as ""THIS is why I must have the iPhone"" except for Facetime and the Retina Display. Being a long time Apple loyalist and enthusiast, it both worries and saddens me to see Apple so blatantly miss the boat. So my question is, has Apple dropped the ball after a solid start and fallen behind so much that the trickle of developers will slowly become a full flow which they won't be able to stop?<p>[1]: www.roughlydrafted.com/2010/06/08/apples-ios-wwdc-strikes-back-after-googles-android-io/",1278185672

1484263,comment,1484149,1484149,0,0,byoung2,,,"<i>sorry, but mobile 4G is not ready for primetime, and I firmly believe Apple won’t even include it on next year’s iPhone 5</i><p>I'll partly agree with the first part of that statement, but does that mean that HTC/Sprint should have left it out of the EVO?  Certainly not.  Sprint invested a great deal in its WiMax infrastructure, and releasing a phone that takes advantage of it now brings in much-needed revenue (the added $10/mo + $29 optional hotspot fees), and it increases public awareness of 4G.  The HTC EVO is a walking PR machine/proof of concept for 4G, and it just put Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile into catch-up mode.  I think it was a brilliant move on Sprint's part, and they'll enjoy the benefits for at least the next year or so.<p>The reason Apple won't include 4G on next year's iPhone is that for better or worse, they are still stuck with AT&T (exclusivity contract expiration aside, there's no GSM alternative, and CDMA is out).  AT&T can't even get 3G to run on all cylinders without breaking the network and angering customers.  To roll out 4G and charge customers more for it (following Sprint's lead), they would have to offer users a much better experience.  The other reason Apple will leave it out is that they need to offer users a compelling reason to get the iPhone 6.<p><i>FaceTime makes video-calling on the Android-based Sprint HTC EVO look silly, because the EVO awkwardly requires users to sign up and download a third-party app, then launch it every time they want to talk. Normal people simply won’t do this.</i><p>I whole-heartedly disagree with this.  Facetime forces users to only call other iPhone 4 users, and only over Wi-Fi.  The HTC EVO might be less convenient in that you have to use Fring or Qik, but these apps are available on multiple platforms (Windows Mobile, Nokia, etc), widening the group of people you can reach.  Video chat also works over 3G/4G, which for me trumps iPhone's ""instant-on"" convenience.  Perfect use case was our company's 4th of July BBQ...I was able to use my EVO at the park to video chat, while my coworkers with the iPhone 4 missed out because there was no WiFi (unless they were to connect to my EVO's hotspot).",1278183873

Stipends at graduate schools are often around $25k/year, so your business would allow you to make the same amount of money with almost no effort. Since they are often funded out of professors' grants, you're limited to working with professors who have funding and have to do their research.

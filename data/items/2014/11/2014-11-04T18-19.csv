I only need to load when my program starts, i.e. after a crash or maybe an upgrade when hot code swapping is not available. Sounds like there may be plenty of persistence schemes that make this not entirely painful (load latest data first, or fallback to disk reads if the data isn&#x27;t entirely loaded yet, which makes the service slower but still available right after a crash).<p>Note, I&#x27;m really just dreaming here, and I appreciate you dreaming along.

In both cases, entanglement is evidenced by the correlation between the states, nothing more.<p>Now, imagine we had entangled coins and we were in separate rooms.  We flip our coins and you observe yours, noting a heads.  In my room, I can&#x27;t know what you did or didn&#x27;t observe.

The author of the post talked about some great business use cases, but in general these expect the user to have the beacon&#x27;s corresponding app. For any kind of app, the user has to opt-in, so the apps they are most likely to opt into are the ones where users install the beacon themselves in order to have a corresponding app on their device automatically adjust to their location.<p>There is also much more value to the user in personal automation, and it isn&#x27;t fraught with the privacy/scaling issues that business automation ideas are. In the grocery store example, how does the app know what the user has in their cart? How many times will it remind the user to pick something up (i.e. what is the user&#x27;s &quot;push message annoyance threshold&quot;)? What if the user decides they no longer need eggs, but the app keeps reminding them to pick up eggs - the friction from opening the app and having to remove an item from a shopping list just so the store&#x27;s beacons will stop annoying you to buy it will make anyone seriously weigh the value of having the app in the first place. As the author pointed out, beacons in a commercial setting have enormous potential to annoy the hell out of consumers.<p>What I really want is a beacon that I can install in my home office, and another that I can install in my work office, so my computer can automatically open up the workflow I had open when I left yesterday. A great side effect of this is that I would be much less inclined to start the day with a dosage of HN.",1415126719

8558241,comment,8553189,8557777,0,0,michaniskin,,,"Yes, in the post I didn&#x27;t get too technical with the treatment of tasks; I&#x27;ll elaborate a little here. First, the command line thing.<p>You&#x27;re right that the command line isn&#x27;t strictly required to use boot, you can do everything at the REPL or perl/awk etc., as you pointed out. But for me it&#x27;s really useful just ergonomically to be able to use command line arguments to configure ad-hoc builds because they can be very concise. Just like I probably wouldn&#x27;t be super excited to use a Clojure shell instead of Bash, because Lisp is usually more verbose for the kinds of things I do on the command line. Consider:<p><pre><code>    $ boot cljs -usO none
</code></pre>
vs<p><pre><code>    (boot (cljs :unified true :source-map true :optimizations :none))
</code></pre>
the command line version is just nicer for that. When it&#x27;s time to automate is when you&#x27;d put that in your build.boot and make it a new task.<p>This brings us to tasks. We used to describe them as &quot;middleware factories&quot; but Rich has provided us with a way cooler name: stateful transducers. The build process can be imagined as a transducer stack applied to a file set instead of to an async channel or sequential thing. The principal value the task abstraction provides is their process-building power.<p>A typical task definition looks like this:<p><pre><code>    (deftask foo
      &quot;This task does foo.&quot;
      [...]                  ; kwargs/cli-opts
      (let [state ...]       ; local state
        (fn [continue]       ; middleware
          (fn [event]        ; handler
            ...              ; build something, do work
            (continue event) ; call continuation
            ))))
</code></pre>
Please ignore &quot;event&quot;, it&#x27;s there for historical reasons. But like transducers, we have powerful ways to build processes from tasks that don&#x27;t need to know anything about each other now. For example:<p><pre><code>    (deftask bar
      &quot;This task does bar.&quot;
      [...]
      (comp
        (fn [continue]
          (fn [event]
            ...
            (continue event)))
        (foo :bar &quot;baz&quot; :baf &quot;quux&quot;)
        (omg :hello &quot;world&quot;)))
</code></pre>
A key property of transducers is that they can also perform process control flow duties. The boot `watch` task, for instance, is a totally general-purpose way to to incremental-anything in boot. The `cljs` task doesn&#x27;t have a file watcher in it, none of the other tasks do. They don&#x27;t need it.<p>Another example is the `cljs-repl` task, which emits ClojureScript code when you start the CLJS REPL. This requires recompiling the JS file and reloading the client. This all happens automatically because the cljs-repl task can call its continuation whenever it likes, so it does that when you start the REPL. This means that your webapp code doesn&#x27;t contain any REPL connecting code, so you don&#x27;t have to think about removing it for production builds etc. The REPL connecting code is in there when you use the task, and not when you don&#x27;t. Very clean.<p>Another interesting property of tasks is that they accept only keyword arguments. They do not take positional parameters. This means that partial application of tasks is idempotent, and that last-setting wins. For instance, given a function f that takes no positional parameters, we have:<p><pre><code>    (-> f (partial :foo &quot;bar&quot;)) ==
    (-> f (partial :foo &quot;bar&quot;) (partial :foo &quot;bar&quot;))
</code></pre>
and<p><pre><code>    (-> f (partial :foo &quot;bar&quot;)) ==
    (-> f (partial :foo &quot;baz&quot;) (partial :foo &quot;bar&quot;)).
</code></pre>
This is pretty interesting because it gives us a nice way to manage global preferences. We have a macro called task-options! which can be used to globally apply options to tasks:<p><pre><code>    (task-options!
      foo [:bar &quot;baz&quot;
           :baf &quot;quux&quot;]
      omg [:hello &quot;world&quot;])
</code></pre>
This macro actually does some currying and alter-var-root, replacing the value of the task var (deftask defines a var, of course) with a curried version. A cool thing about this is that the last-setting-wins property means that you can override these settings on the command line or in the REPL:<p><pre><code>    (boot (foo :bar &quot;not-baz&quot;) (omg))
</code></pre>
which would override the :bar option, but not the others.<p>This is probably long enough, hahaha! I&#x27;ll hand the mic back to you now :)",1415126537

According to NYC&#x27;s labor statistics [1], Finance as a whole (including all of commercial and investment banking, insurance, and real estate) makes up about 12.5% of the city&#x27;s private sector jobs, and employs about as many people as the NYC local government does. For comparison, the Education and Health Services sector employs almost twice as many people (~24%), and Leisure and Hospitality about the same (11.4%).<p>Its much harder to find good statistics on the Bay Area because its comprised of so many different municipalities, but I would bet the Tech industry employs way more than 12.5% of private sector employees there. There&#x27;s also no real &quot;runner-up&quot; in the region; Finance is <i>one</i> of the industries here, Tech is <i>the</i> industry in the Bay Area.<p>[1] <a href=""http://labor.ny.gov/stats/nyc/index.shtm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://labor.ny.gov/stats/nyc/index.shtm</a>",1415126340

The chances of them outsourcing the design are zero, because it will simply kill all the fun.<p>That&#x27;s not too dissimilar to suggesting hiring an ISO-certified shop to redo your beautiful hand-optimized assembly code in an industry-standard Java.

They won&#x27;t be using SSL and $300K is not enough to run their custom crypto through an audit that will be good for all the &quot;experts&quot;.

In theory, they should be fixing that, but in reality they don&#x27;t seem to give a flying f#ck about it, which to me actually looks more like a show of a backbone rather than of an ignorance.<p>Ultimately they want the same thing as this Moxie person.

8558220,comment,8556236,8556236,0,0,rizwan,,,"iOS 8 added many useful APIs, but I find many are hard to use while maintaining support for iOS 7.<p>For example: 
- To share code between your app and your iOS 8 extensions, you want to put them in a shared framework, something which was just added in Xcode 6, and compatible only with iOS 8. So using shared code from iOS 7 means you&#x27;d have to keep copies of your source in the main app framework.<p>- Photos.framework is really great, but is completely different from Assets.framework, so building a photo app means writing your code twice. Yes, you can use Assets framework from iOS 8, but it&#x27;s unclear how iCloud Photo Library will work with it (iOS 8.0 inadvertently removed &quot;Camera Roll&quot; from Assets framework, for example)<p>- Can&#x27;t clean up your UIActionSheet, UIAlertView, UIPopoverController code with UIAlertController until you go iOS 8+<p>So iOS 8 moves a lot of things forward really nicely, and building an iOS 8-only app has been really great, but I feel, more so than before, that it&#x27;s harder to maintain support for older iOS versions.<p>I was hoping iOS 8&#x27;s adoption numbers would be rising faster than it did for iOS 7, so it&#x27;d be easier to justify dropping iOS 7 support sooner, but anecdotally it seems the large installation binary has made it hard to update 16GB devices.",1415126327

But when looking at larger trends you need to consider  larger changes that made city living much more pleasant in comparison.<p>First a dramatic drop in crime.  In many ways there were similar rates of criminals in the suburbs, but the lower density defused their impact.  EX: Kids throwing rocks through car windows spend more time walking and less time destroying things in the suburbs.  But the same applies to pickpockets or home invasions etc.  Coupled with local reporting looking at the absolute numbers of crimes vs and ignoring the rate of said crime.  (That&#x27;s 5 blocks from here fells vary different than that&#x27;s 20 miles from here.)<p>Second, dramatically increased air quality due to the loss of the manufacturing sector and improved pollution controls on cars.<p>PS: One of the more interesting ideas on urban renewal basically goes like this.  The Gay community does not care about local schools and is willing to trade poor schools for cheaper housing.  They raise the rates slightly and push out the poor population.  Fewer kids and higher property taxes improve schools which attracts young people who further drive up rents pushing out the Gay community who don&#x27;t care about schools. And the cycle continues.  Crime rates can be dramatically different over just a few blocks, but having a stable buffer zone is very important.  (You can substitute young people without kids in the model they serve the same function but they tend to spread out more diffusing the impact.)",1415125919

The implication is that it is impossible for one particle to very quickly affect the other by sending a virtual particle (or even message), as this would mean the particle travelling faster than the speed of light (and that would be &#x27;a bad thing&#x27;!).<p>So instead of breaking c, we assume things with non-locality that particles &#x27;spookily know&#x27;/are affected by things that may possibly be on the other side of the universe. This causes a myriad of problems in the actual physical interpretations.<p>I remember thinking as well, hey why don&#x27;t we just accept non-locality, but, actually doing physics with it you end run into myriad headscratchers that even make the broken Copenhagen look attractive! One that I did for my MSc was for the case of an single electron in a (harmonic was it?) potential well and solving for a stationary state. By dealing with the Bohmian waveguide model you end up getting that electron is experiencing no overall force - therefore it is literally stationary (serious problems there!) or moving at a constant speed, and could be ANYWHERE in space (non-locality). So your could have &#x27;bound electrons&#x27; that are over in Mars or... aren&#x27;t moving? I&#x27;ll put up a work through of that if anyone wants to check!

This ardent noncomformity seems to occur when a problem is discovered, no one knows what to do about it, and it becomes &quot;cool&quot; to take an antithetical stance to its superficial faults.<p>For example, it&#x27;s now &quot;cool&quot; to hate suburbia. Most of the kids in Williamsburg go on about how much they hate the suburban environment they grew up in. Now, there&#x27;s a lot to dislike about the typical suburb: whether it&#x27;s the low-quality and unattractive housing, the racism and classism behind it, the restructuring of life around child-raising that (paradoxically) results in it being done poorly-- kids are better socialized if their parents have adult friends who <i>aren&#x27;t</i> all parents-- and finally the expensive environmental catastrophe of billions of unnecessary, pointless driving miles. And yet... hating suburbia is <i>about as &quot;suburban&quot;, in the negative sense, as it gets</i>.<p>The hipsters are rebelling against middle-class conformity and insularity by taking attitudes and tastes from the lower and upper classes, often haphazardly without knowing what they&#x27;re doing. It&#x27;s a vote of no confidence in the old, mostly suburban, middle class... maybe it&#x27;s also a bet on peak oil, and the unwinding of car culture is one thing I really like (but you don&#x27;t need to be a hipster to ride a bike) but... mostly it&#x27;s about class. The problem is that this rebellion strengthens many of the bad things that it seems to be fighting. Jersey suburbs may be out of style, but Williamsburg landlords are making out like bandits. No real change. On the whole, most of what&#x27;s billed as &quot;hipster culture&quot; is just lame Cali suburb culture in an urban environment.",1415125446

A single big tree (or graph) of objects. Some primitives to make it thread-safe somehow (immutable collections, or mutexes, or just old-fashioned single-threadedness like Node - whatever), and that&#x27;s it. Requests from the client query and mutate that data. In <i>very many</i> situations, I wouldn&#x27;t need anything special to make this work fine with an application up to a pretty large number of users. Not all apps do big data analyses. RAMs are gigantic these days, bigger than the SQL datafiles of swathes of webapps.<p>However, there&#x27;s that pesky problem of code upgrades and crashing servers. If my server would never crash and I could hot-swap the code, I wouldn&#x27;t need persistence at all. But I do, so I don&#x27;t just want an in-memory datastructure, but a <i>persistent</i> in-memory data structure. I want to use this datastructure as easily as the programming language could possibly make it be for me while still guaranteeing some sane level of persistence and fault tolerance.<p>Redis is a nice idea, but the fact that it&#x27;s a separate server, with a client and a protocol and data structures that <i>just not precisely</i> map to my programming language&#x27;s data structures force me to write a whole bunch of boilerplate anyway. Even more so with other databases like Mongo or Postgres.<p>If I understand it well, Loki doesn&#x27;t entirely do what I&#x27;d want: it does not save the data to disk on every change, but less often, if I get it right. That might be good enough if my problem allows for many little independent Loki databases, but if the dataset is a gigabyte and persistence means flushing that whole gigabyte to disk after every data change, it probably won&#x27;t work very well.<p>I&#x27;m really curious if other people here have similar ideas, maybe implementations, of these concepts. Maybe Loki could be extended with a snapshot+operation_log type of data storage like Redis has and then it&#x27;d be pretty close.",1415125256

I recommend www.indoo.rs as the only solution that got close to what we needed (though it&#x27;s still pretty darn immature).<p>- Speaking of indoor navigation, you need a ton of points to do it well (whether that&#x27;s beacons or wifi routers, you decide).<p>- Using beacons for granular location-aware uses might as well go out the window if you&#x27;re looking for accurate and precise readings around ~1-3ft.<p>- Did I mention power yet? All of the beacons we started with around 9 months ago have dead batteries. Even with conservative power modes set. The only beacons that don&#x27;t are RadBeacons USB sticks that plug into wall outlets. And that&#x27;s only because they don&#x27;t have batteries.<p>I really, really want them to be good. But they die too quickly, and don&#x27;t provide granular signal data. Hold the phone between you and the beacon and get a decent signal, then turn 180 degrees so that you are between the phone and the beacon. Apparently you&#x27;ve moved 45ft.",1415124377

4334544,comment,4333960,4333960,6,0,madhadron,,,"The blog article bears no resemblance to the actual math, but the issue is the same as always: if you assume locality, you can have hidden variables. Pusey et al assume separability (i.e., no entanglement). Hardy does so as well. It's put in weakly and carefully, but it's still assuming locality and showing that you can have hidden variables.<p>Everyone gets so stuck on the wave function. Look, if you assume that your physical system's state is described by a vector in a linear space, that you can project onto subspaces to describe subsets of the state, and that the space has a metric and is complete (all sequences in the space converge to something in the space) then if you impose a smooth dynamics on the space, then there will be an equivalent differential equation, because there's only one infinite dimensional Hilbert space up to isomorphism, and L2, the space of square integrable functions, happens to be one of its faces.<p>The real questions is why the theory is formulated in a linear, complete metric space. Someone posted a lecture by Scott Aaronson a few days back that had some interesting pointers on that.<p>Seriously, if the wave function bothers you, just don't use it.",1344009548

Rather than communicate this directly to persons ABC, an elaborate system of misleading emails is constructed.<p>A more effective and less damaging way to handle this is to meet individually with the specific persons who are having problems and explain it has become clear they are not productive when working from home, and so they'll have to work from their office from now on. And if that doesn't work out, then they can be dismissed.<p>Instead of handling this situation in the obvious manner, which would be effective and would not publicly shame anyone, we have two emails proposed to be sent to the entire company establishing a global policy to deal with a minority of people who are having problems. The wording doesn't matter, the problem is that the email is sent to everyone to deal with a specific problem with specific employees.<p>This is done this way because management is comprised of ineffective cowards who are terrified of confrontation and communication.<p>These emails show that the real problem here is highly ineffective management.

When scientists conduct an observation of the photon they become entangled with it, and similarly there are two sections to the scientist+photon waveform.

4334338,comment,4330920,4331801,1,0,leviathant,,,"Anecdote coming your way:<p>My wife is a composer - currently attending UPenn getting her PhD in music composition. She does not typically perform her music herself. In 2009, her concert opera concerning the senate judiciary hearings on former attorney general Alberto Gonzales. We recorded a performance of ""The Gonzales Cantata"" and posted on Bandcamp, iTunes, and Amazon in anticipation of a series of live performances done at that year's Philadelphia Fringe Festival.<p>The recording earned a little over $1000 (half that from Bandcamp alone). The live performances earned several times that, enough that we could pay each of the over 30 performers involved at least three figures.<p>$1000 might not sound like much, but put it into perspective, it was her first recorded piece, and it's probably earned her more than what her professors have made with releases they've done. (Well, not necessarily her Penn professors) Had she released through a label? She was approached by one of the more well known 'classical' labels about doing a studio recording and 'label' release. The deal basically would have been that she'd have paid thousands of dollars, and gotten a box of CDs and miniscule residual income when all was said and done.. and this is how a lot of people in the classical world do things. The money may come from grants or patrons, but it's generally wasted.<p>$1000 for a single recording is not enough to live off, but $1000 for your first release, particularly a fairly obscure release, is incredibly encouraging. As a composer, she has other sources of income to chase down, whether it's commissions, or sheet music, performances, licensing, etc. I would not be surprised if after graduating, she is able to sustain a living composing music. If that doesn't work out, she can make plenty of money in private lessons.<p>We haven't done any 'big' recordings since then. Last year we recorded a piano-vocal piece, ""Tesla's Pigeon"", and commissioned a visual artist to do the cover art. We Kickstarted asking for $550 and raised $787, and while it's up on Bandcamp and iTunes, we haven't gone promotion crazy about it like we did for The Gonzales Cantata, so it's only made a couple hundred dollars, mostly through physical sales at concert performances - which themselves have brought in enough money that again, we were able to pay the performers well and have a nice amount leftover for ourselves.<p>I think it's a good start, and I think it's far better than she would have been able to do if she were born twenty years sooner than she had been.",1344006747

Hell, we know microsoft will have to be pushed kicking and screaming into supporting WebGL (and likely the fullscreen API as well as they go hand-in-hand), and they've just proposed their alternative to WebRTC (how not unexpected). See also: their proposing a brand new touch API, but not implementing the one which everybody is already using and the current standard.<p>> And, you know, IE6 was actually the best web browser out there for a long time.<p>IE5/Mac says ""bitch, please"". Also Phoenix was already a better browser than IE6 about 2 years after the latter's release.",1354215599

4849589,comment,4848998,4849447,8,0,recoiledsnake,,,">The problem is that the pricing puts it into a weird space in the market.<p>Edit:Just like usual it looks like the notable number of anti-'M$' haters on HN are flagging this article down the front page just like they do to any article that is not hating on MS(resulting in some legit sites getting fully permabanned). Stay classy HN.<p>Original Comment:<p>That's the thing, it defines a new place in the market because it has new characteristics, just like the iPad did when it started and many were calling it just a bigger iPod Touch or a smaller crippled laptop and were saying it would fail.<p>I think it's especially good for developers when you can run the full Visual Studio and Eclipse etc. but still portable, not to mention the Enterprise where it fully integrates with AD and group policy and can support the full Office Suite including Outlook.The digitizer and the pen is a nice bonus. In some companies, tablets have a stigma that they're entertainment devices meant for Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja, and thus management doesn't like buying them(except for senior management). With the Surface Pro, it might be seen as a productivity device that you can use while traveling and also they can lock them down as much as you want to with group policy, do updates and deployments just like the regular desktop PCs and laptops.<p>It'd be okay for couch surfing, I have a HP Touch pad which roughly the same size and weight and it isn't too bad, but you could probably buy a 7"" tablet on the cheap if couch surfing is your thing. So, for some people this is a good choice and I think the pricing is on the premium to make it feel like a premium device.<p>I think one of the big points is the portability factor, thus it may not replace a 13.3"" Ultrabook or a 7"" tablet for all, but for some, it can and for some others, they will just buy it in addition to them.<p>My only concern is the battery life, they could swap out that i5 for a Clover Trail Atom but I think they want to keep the power. Maybe there will be a cheaper lighter version later with a new Atom.<p>>An argument could be made that Surface Pro isn't just a laptop, but a laptop plus a tablet in which case the appropriate price comparison would be the cost of a Macbook and an iPad.<p>I don't think pricing ever works like that. But anyway, if you want to think it that way, they're giving a discount for the lower battery life and greater weight.<p>One other issue about pricing is that they can't use their tens of billions of dollars to subsidize it, it'd just kill the OEMs. With this price, the OEMs have some breathing room to make competing devices.<p>I think quite some folks will have a desktop for PC gaming, Laptop for couch work, Surface for working while not at home, and a 7"" tablet for couch/web surfing(or a ~5"" phone).",1354215531

It's also about watching things you HAVE purchased.<p>I own a BluRay disc that I purchased new. I attempted to watch it on our ""big screen,"" a projector with a DVI input but no HDMI. BZZZ. The fully legal software that came with my computer won't let me watch over a non-HDMI connection, and VLC can't handle this particular BluRay disc, even with the latest patches, extra files, and instructions I can find posted online.<p>WHY can't I watch it that way? Because some idiot executive somewhere thinks that it will make it easier to circumvent the DRM on BluRay, and therefore they screw paying customers who don't have the newest equipment.<p>Either that or it's Sony attempting to coerce people to upgrade their equipment so they can sell more TVs.<p>Either way it's unethical, and a technological violation of Copyright fair use rights: I should be able to consume a product however I like. I bought it, I want to watch it, and there's no technical reason I shouldn't be able to -- it's entirely a business reason, either way.<p>I'm not talking about a right necessarily ensconced in law (IANAL), but a moral right. I should also be able to rip and remix content under fair use. And in the case of BluRay, it may be illegal<p>Copyright law exists (in the US at least) for the benefit of the PUBLIC, not the benefit of the IP owners. Read the Constitution if you don't believe me (or this TechDirt article which provides additional support [1]); it's pretty clear and on point about why we have IP laws.<p>At the moment the laws are written to benefit IP holders and not the public. And it's that way simply because they have better lobbyists.<p>What did I do to watch the movie? Put it on my tiny laptop screen to watch in front of my whole family, and accumulated a bit more hatred of the MPAA and constituent companies. Piracy is illegal, but what they are doing now should be as well. And the sad truth is that, when you really hate someone, and they've harmed you, it becomes easier to justify ""harming"" them.

The issue isn't whether the latest version of the browser is capable, but rather whether we'd want to get back into bed with Microsoft given their past history.

Having a great combat system is not the sole part of gameplay. Having AAA graphics, having many side missions, having complex locations, having complex characters, having lots of different combat styles, having stealth, having character growth, etc., etc.<p>Gameplay is made up of all those things and you're taking one tiny part of what makes it up and calling FO3 terrible because you didn't like its gameplay mix. It's without a doubt one of the greatest games of the last 5 years. It's just that you don't like it.<p>Personally I found NV tediously linear. It's a big loop that you go from start town and follow the road round to the dam. Every part of the main story was 'urgent'. End of exploring. Add to that I never felt any attachment to the courier. To me NV had very few unique large locations and was unfinished. Camp McCarran, Caesar's camp, Forlorn Hope, the casinos and the Nellis AFB all felt characterless and empty, as if they'd meant to put a lot more effort into them but hadn't had time so just filled them with unscripted NPCs. Even Novac needed more character. There were so, so many NPCs that were just nobodies. The arena was a total waste of space, a great concept that hadn't been fleshed out.<p>Conversely I thought FO3 was amazing, you had to roam all over the map. It felt as if you should set up in certain locations for a while, so you got to know them. Every place was packed with unique NPCs and there were practically no areas just crammed with 'anonymous' NPCs apart from areas you'd actually expect them not to talk to you like the BoS compound. You got a house. There was no constant urgency to follow the main mission until the late stages. I loved it. I like being told a story as I play and having too many choices means the story and characters inevitably become extremely shallow, to me, the NV story was shallow.<p>So based on two totally different aspects of game play we have two totally different opinions. I still enjoyed NV. It was just very shallow and didn't give me the wasteland survivor vibe that FO3, imo, did so well.",1354213554

Also, there isn't a team of OEM Apple developers writing Ubuntu PPA support for either machine, so I'm stuck on OS X again, which I'm pretty disillusioned with.<p>2) I'm actually still not really clear what the advantage of a retina display is.

It's a fishing expedition -- it's like raiding the phone company's offices when someone has used a prepaid burner phone because they have the ability to spoof the IP address or phone number of any of their unidentifiable customers. There is no more reason to suspect that the exit node operator is at fault than any other ISP. Especially given the amount of harassment these raids cause for the victims -- can you reasonably state that the police should be able to enter a telco hotel and shut down and confiscate all of the equipment because not all of the traffic passing through it can be traced to an identifiable source? If not then what makes this different?<p>>I'm not aware of a good solution that avoids inconveniencing exit node operators without giving them some kind of blanket immunity to investigation that goes beyond just relayed traffic.<p>The solution is to rely on less disruptive investigative means until sufficient evidence is available to determine whether the exit node operator is the likely source of the traffic. For example, get a warrant and wiretap their phone and email and see if they're trafficking in illicit materials through those channels.

But there are some instances where people still need this reminder.<p>Just recently, a recruiter wrote that a CS degree from Brown would count for a lot more than one from UIUC or U Tex.  I was personally sort of shocked by this, because I thought that it was widely understood that the rigor and quality of CS programs at these universities was very high (absolutely nothing against Brown, which has great students, I was just sort of amazed that a recruiter would discount degrees from two ""top 10"" programs simply because, as large state schools, they're easier to ""get into""... yeah, and anyone can ""get into"" basic training in the marines, it's getting <i>through</i> that's the tough part).

Then you could make the anti-raid argument, ""The economic disruption of taking a legitimate business off-line and possibly causing irreparable harm to innocent citizens does not warrant such a drastic measure without solid evidence of complicity in the commission of a crime.""<p>In the United States there is an analogous situation which is that of the 'high speed pursuit.' In the pursuit situation the officers have strong reason to believe the driver of a vehicle was involved in a crime and seek to arrest them. The driver of the vehicle doesn't want to be arrested and so they drive away quickly. If the officers give chase, they greatly increase the chance that harm will come to innocent bystanders. If they don't give chase they risk losing their suspect. Generally those debates come down to things like ""what crime might they have committed?"" and if it was failure to stop for a right turn, that is seen as not being as 'reasonable to chase' as hit and run vehicular manslaughter.<p>I tend to fall into the ""Do the police work to figure out who the crooks are and if you need the co-operation of an end-node provider then get a warrant to compel that co-operation."" But I also have spoken to officers who feel that such restrictions are 'red tape' and keep them from doing the job they were paid to do.<p>In this particular case we don't have the police version of the story. Perhaps they think this guy is complicit? Did they raid/seize any other end nodes? Did they have a warrant and what did it say? Had this person been involved in other questionable activities? ""Presumption of innocence"" is not a principle that extends outside of US borders so its always difficult to contextualize police action in other countries to Americans who take their constitution for granted.",1354212221

* Your quotes are all from famous books and movies, and you have affiliate links to Amazon... brilliant!
* Do you have a mechanism that minimizes repetition?
* Do you ever need to fake competition?
* Could you visualize mistakes as crashes, to keep things exciting?
* Consider making a keyboard UI for the site (Although I use vimium)
* Build a mechanism to challenge your friends.
* Analyze history and plot it. Take into account difficulty of paragraphs (come up with difficulty rating based on your user data). 
* Give typing tips; perhaps it's enough to analyze words that the user mistyped, and offer them more passages with them. 
* Improve the CSS. The UI should reflect the incredibly high level of polish in the gameplay.<p>Maybe I'll have more random ideas when I play it tomorrow. ;)",1354212114

In the end, the kid ends up with their copy of Minecraft, and promptly begins either building things or setting other peoples' things on fire.<p>Imagine that scenario, but instead, the kid believes they are preordering a game that their heroes are making. Perhaps if they are a bit older but still naive, they understand that the game does not yet exist, but they cannot fathom the possibility that their heroes will not follow through. I can easily see that scenario playing out almost the same: ""Mom/dad, can I please please please have the Yogscast game? All my friends are ordering it and it's only $15 and it's going to be amazing and blah blah blah..."" The parent probably won't read far enough into it to understand that it's a Kickstarter for something that doesn't exist yet, and will do whatever they usually do in these situations.",1354212061

You produce a painting, it's your very own painting. You produce a pie, it's your very own pie.<p>Ralph sees your Very Own Tool and decides that'd be handy. Ralph knows taking your Very Own Tool would deprive you of your property and decides he won't do that. Not to mention it's a physical item and the law has something to saw about theft of physical items. So Ralph, being the upstanding citizen he is, makes another tool just like yours - his Very Own Tool. Ralph's also a bit of an extrovert and tells everyone about this great new tool and other people want one. So Ralph sets about making more of the tool you designed to sell to other people.<p>Do you have the <i>right</i> to be upset at Ralph for making money off your idea without compensation to you?<p>Controlling <i>copying</i> of your creations is what copyright is about.

That’s not fearmongering on his part, but hope (hopemongering?) and prediction. So anything that an Administration does to endorse international speech-restrictive norms might well have an effect on our own constitutional rights as well.""",1254527555

858229,comment,857362,858173,0,0,Confusion,,,"My intention is not to use Marx to justify anything; I just want to lay focus on something he and Engels got exactly right and which is being forgotten: capitalism is amoral (a term that is not be confused with immoral). As a result of this, parts of their analysis are extremely valuable and it's a damn shame the anti-communist tendencies have swept that under the rug.<p>By stating that evolution is an amoral process, I completely condemn any form of Social Darwinism: you cannot derive moral values from amoral principles. Evolution is completely amoral: that which reproduces itself, will continue to exist in some form, independent of our moral judgment about it. Social Darwinists are therefore guilty of the naturalistic fallacy<p>However, the same goes for capitalism: that which increases capital the most stays in the best position to keep increasing capital. Because of irrationality and a lack of market transparency, the best moral intentions on the part of individual humans cannot prevent immoral consequences from arising. I'm not saying any of those immoral consequences are unique to capitalism. I am saying they are unavoidable when you let capitalism go unchecked.<p><i>It's not clear why the government is the only institution in society that can avoid failure</i><p>And I cannot prove it is. However, as far as I can see, no other institution has the power nor the mandate to guide capitalist forces.

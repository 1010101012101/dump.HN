Its the sort of field where you can fool yourself sometimes by not being careful enough with training and testing data, so random people off the internet generally don't seem worth the trouble to an established researcher.",1195043516
79721,comment,79164,79540,0,0,ian,,,"Thanks very much for your feedback man. We're aware of the issue that occurs with a few bands (e.g. Underworld) and are fixing that. Imagine my horror when I was listening to one of my favourite London producers Burial and got recommended bands like Grave, Funeral, Resurrection. That'll be fixed soon.<p>We're also going to make the recommendations much more tour focused as you suggest. The goal is to really separate the signal out from the noise so you know which of the hundreds of small gigs going on are most likely to interest you.<p>We're also going to have user preferences for the recommendations (particularly how obscure you want them to be and whether you only want to see artists on tour. RIP B.I.G.)<p>Really interested to talk more at the hacker meetup. I've got a ton of emails so should be a good group.",1195043292

Where is the ""physical grounding"" aspect if I want to build a search engine for the web? It's all just information.<p>Not saying that getting physical can not yield interesting results, but to state that it is the only possible way to program intelligence seems just wrong. ",1195042032

But I send my kids here because the fact is you go to one of the best schools in the country: Rushmore.\nNow, for some of you it doesn't matter. You were born rich and you're going to stay rich.<p>But here's my advice to the rest of you: Take dead aim on the rich boys. Get them in the crosshairs and take them down. Just remember, they can buy anything but they can't buy backbone. Don't let them forget it. Thank you.""\n- Herman Blume, speech to Rushmore Academy",1201539428

105620,comment,105562,105562,0,0,koolmoe,,,"<i>A production language should favor reading the code over writing it, and a toy language should do the opposite. Note that I don't mean that the language is a toy, but that it's used to make toys.</i><p>Yes, Lisp is used to make toy programs like the software running on the $100 million 1998 Deep Space 1 probe.<p><i>Their final top-level function is:</i><p><pre><code>  (define (sqrt x)\n  (fixed-point-of-transform (lambda (y) (- (square y) x))\n                          newton-transform\n                          1.0)\n</code></pre>\n<i>Good luck figuring that out. I'm sure it was fun to decompose the problem into those functions, but in production two years from now some programmer is going to be in a world of pain when he has to add a feature to that program.</i><p>That's only hard to read if you don't know Lisp.  And the function names are quite descriptive if you understand numerical methods.  If the hypothetical developer doesn't understand fixed points and Newton's method, he shouldn't be modifying that sqrt function anyway.<p>There might be a good point about obfuscation via abstraction somewhere in SICP, but this example isn't it.  Even if it were, it has less to do with the language itself and more to do with the developer that designed the abstraction.<p>I suspect Mr. Kestleloot is simply ill-informed.",1201538912

105618,comment,105562,105562,0,0,raju,,,"""Many modern languages similarly give up readability for writability, like Ruby, where you can literally redefine the + operator on integers so that it no longer gives you their sum."" I believe Dave Thomas covered this in ""Metaprogramming Ruby"" video [<a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/metaprogramming-ruby"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/metaprogramming-ruby</a>], and the problem here is not that the language allows you to do it, rather your programmers are willing to do something like this.<p>This is not a language feature problem, its a developer education problem. I agree with sammyo that a wrong abstraction can make it harder to decipher whats really going on. On the other hand, isn't that true for any kind of abstraction? Frameworks like Spring abstract away notions of AOP and unless you really understand whats going on under the hood you will be left scratching your head. Does that make Java a toy language? If yes, then whats the point of this post?",1201538347

When Google came on to the scene, everybody loved them (including myself) for supplying innovative technology that brought more order to something that was growing ever more disordered, and they were sticking-it to Microsoft as an under-dog as well. However, recently, I feel more and more people (including myself) are concerned over privacy (not just Google, but Facebook, etc.), hence, the ever rising rate of suspicion towards Google. I even find myself liking Microsoft because they appear to be the under-dog now in terms of internet technologies, and particularly after that Bill Gates video about his retirement - he seems like an alright guy! If Google did a video like that, then I am sure people would warm to them (even more). Doing good deeds every now and then just makes Google seem as if they are doing it for the sake of keeping face, whilst the Gates Foundations loud publicisings puts Microsoft in an increasingly positive light.",1201538079

To do that, just make it clear that you don't actually understand macrology and what the right circumstances for using and creating macros are.",1201537032

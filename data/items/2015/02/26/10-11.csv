9111959,comment,9109801,9109801,0,0,Booktrope,,,"If the stats aren&#x27;t based on samples of real-world data, rather than very rigorously designed experimental comparisons, I think there&#x27;s another reason to be wary of p-values.  [Note, in what follows I probably use some terminology wrong, because I&#x27;m not a statistician, but I do think the point is important and I don&#x27;t see much written about it.] In the real world data is not a bunch of independent events, but events (or data points) that are interconnected in ways that are difficult to quantify.  I once heard a presentation by an expert in AB testing at a leading tech company who became wary of his results and brought his concerns about non-independence of events that were being tested to corporate statisticians. (He was concerned that, even though the AB testing procedure supposedly randomized the test, interconnectedness within website traffic was not being accounted for.) By his account, the statisticians agreed it was a problem but recommended that he assume that variations due to non-independence would more or less balance each other out.  He wasn&#x27;t satisfied with this and said that he went ahead and did some more measurements, then ran out all the binomial expansions rather than relying on approximations.  When he did this more detailed work, he found out that with at least some web-based AB tests, where conventional statistical formulas showed a p-value of .05, he was getting a confidence level of more like 30%.  (I don&#x27;t think you could call his measurement a p-value because he wasn&#x27;t using the formulas normally used to compute p-values, but I think what he was saying was more or less that the p-value from the forumalae was .05 when it should have been .30 from a more rigorous look)<p>As I&#x27;m not a statistician by trade I don&#x27;t keep up on the literature very well, but interconnectedness of data does seem to me to be a very important issue.  I&#x27;m wondering if anyone can point me to some helpful reading to understand this side of the issue better.  In particular, is there any approach to AB testing that can reliably address the issue of data interconnectedness in the kind of situation described above?",1424948194

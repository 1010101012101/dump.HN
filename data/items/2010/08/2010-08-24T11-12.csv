One, it might well be that an employee's skill set has suddenly increased in market value, or that the employee has essential knowledge but genuinely has a better offer from a competitor. Telling her to ""wait three months until the next review process"" will probably lose that employee.<p>Two, the general tone of the advice is ""plan things well in advance"" (compensation, structural adjustment etc.). The fact is that you can never plan everything well enough in advance, especially things like structural adjustment. The article doesn't address what to do when your plans inevitably ""collapse in the presence of the enemy"".<p>Three, it is a fact that you can't simply fire an executive just because it is obvious to the wiser people in the company that he's incompetent. He will have plenty of friends and will be sure to raise hell for it. This is a sure way to get lots and lots of politics, and of the most unpleasant sort too.

A new home healthcare franchise? These are all new businesses run by entrepreneurs, but they are not ""startups"" in the way we generally refer to them on HN. I know several family members that have these kinds of franchise businesses and they never refer to themselves as owners of startups, but as owners of small businesses. Small distinction but lest the VCs and hackers say they create all the jobs, realize that the companies doing ""established business"" they so look down on are counted amongst startups in this data.<p>2) Common sense defeats their numbers.

The income stratification is insane.<p>Tim Ferris's figures match my experience. What he <i>doesn't</i> make explicit is that ""publishing"" is about fourteen different vertically integrated businesses flying in loose formation -- genre fiction publishing, for example (my stomping ground) is utterly different from business publishing or academic publishing, although the products are <i>sometimes</i> sold via the same retail channels -- and the prospects for a successful career vary drastically between fields. Nor does success in one field imply a track record transferable sideways into another publishing field.<p>I'd also pick a nit: in my experience, ebook sales (and Amazon Kindle store sales in particular) are <i>dwarfed</i> by hardcover sales -- by a 50:1 ratio, in fact. Amazon are almost certainly cherry-picking if they can come up with books where Kindle sales outstrip hardcover. However, that's looking backwards -- it's fairly clear that ebooks are a rapidly growing sector and in another 2-5 years they'll definitively overtake hardcover sales by volume, if not by revenue. (Hardcovers net roughly $16 after discount, of which 10-15% goes to the author; Kindle store books net $7-10, of which Amazon takes a 30% cut before 5-10% of the remainder goes to the author.)",1282649597

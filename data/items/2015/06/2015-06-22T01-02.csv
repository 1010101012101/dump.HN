9755782,comment,9752899,9754925,0,0,dalke,,,"I just watched it. I heard pretty much the same aspirations since the 1980s. See <a href=""https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/www/section2_82_2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/www/section2_82_2.html</a> for when AutoDesk looked at entering this field.<p>At 15:56 the speaker says &quot;Synthetic chemists normally they design things with plastic model sets.&quot;<p>This just isn&#x27;t true, and hasn&#x27;t been for a very long time. At 17:54 he even says there&#x27;s GUI-based software now to design molecules. That&#x27;s what most chemists use.<p>My experience is that it doesn&#x27;t take 20 minutes to draw a molecule using the current generation of tools. In fact, you can try it now - go to <a href=""http://web.chemdoodle.com/demos/sketcher"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.chemdoodle.com/demos/sketcher</a> or <a href=""https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/edit2/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/edit2/index.html</a> or <a href=""http://scitouch.net/ketcher-demo/ketcher.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scitouch.net/ketcher-demo/ketcher.html</a> and draw one yourself. (This is for small molecule chemistry. For large molecule chemistry, there are other tools and other issues to worry about.)<p>In minute 23 he talks about computing the second derivative of the force fields, and how complex it is. Thing is, my co-worker did that manually when he wrote the original NAMD implementation. (NAMD is a molecular dynamic program.) So it&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s all that hard to compute. It&#x27;s just tedious. (And his code is 10% slower than the hand-written code, so he knows that people do this sort of thing manually.)<p>While it&#x27;s useful to have automatic code generators if you want to add new force fields often, we just don&#x27;t do it all that often, because parameterizing the force field is the hard problem, not computing the second derivative.<p>At 31:25 he says that SciPy is only really possible because of Boost.Python. This isn&#x27;t true. I just downloaded scipy-0.16.0b2 and verified that it does not use Boost.Python. (&quot;ag -i BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE&quot; finds no matches.)<p>At 49:30 he talks about a technique that sounds like pharmacophore models, which have been around since at least the 1990s. There are tools that will build molecules to fit pharmacophore models.<p>What I didn&#x27;t see was anything about dealing with waters, and counter-ions, toxicity, or AMDE (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) issues.<p>I didn&#x27;t hear anything which required multiple years of tool building (&quot;yak shaving&quot;) to get to what he wanted. Every technique he mentioned is something that people have been doing already, in C/C++/Python.",1434938313

My primary recommendation is to try reading a couple books about the subject, which should help you get a better grip on the parts you’re currently missing.<p>> <i>RGB is a colour model</i><p>Without some further qualification, “color model” and “color space” are effectively synonyms.<p>> <i>It is misinformation.</i><p>There’s really nothing particularly wrong with the linked article. I don’t like the author’s proposed HUSL space, but his explanation of why HSL and HSV are bad tools is straightforward and reasonable.<p>> ... <i>a given HSL / HSV implementation may not accurately deliver a given chromaticity vector</i> ...<p>In a technical sense, “chromaticity vector” is not very meaningful as a term when discussing gamma-corrected RGB coordinates, and is <i>completely meaningless</i> w/r/t HSL or HSV. Chromaticity is a precise technical term, referring to the projection of trichromatic matching functions onto a two-dimensional plane perpendicular to luminance. When people talk about “chromaticity” they usually either mean xy coordinates in xyY space, or sometimes u&#x27;, v&#x27; coordinates, or very occasionally some other chromaticity plane, such as more recent spaces based on more explicit measurements of human cone responses. The Cr and Cb coordinates of a Y&#x27;CrCb model are sometimes referred to as “chromaticity” coordinates, but in a technical sense that is a wrong and misleading term to use.<p>I’m not sure what “given chromaticity vector” you are talking about, but if you want to get chromaticity from R&#x27;G&#x27;B&#x27; values, you should first linearize them, then transform from RGB -> XYZ, and then divide by Y to find x and y.<p>> ... <i>has more to do with the nature of colour spaces than the model&#x27;s implementation implicitly</i><p>This is not a comprehensible string of words.

Then the idea is, when you unwrap a Dyn function at runtime, to distribute the function checks to the domain and range of the function.<p>Say you had some untyped function `f` that is Dyn -> Dyn.<p>(defn f [a :- Dyn] :- Dyn
  a)<p>Running<p>(inc (f 1))<p>would wrap 1 in Dyn, then a Dyn exits as a return value, so no further wrapping is needed. Now it&#x27;s `inc`&#x27;s responsibility to ensure it&#x27;s really being passed a number, so it unwraps the Dyn and finds an int inside.<p>So you&#x27;re right - it only works with first-order values without this kind of machinery, which end up looking pretty much like what I talk about in the article.",1434934967

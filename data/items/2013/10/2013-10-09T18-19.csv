While bugs do happen and I can&#x27;t speak for the SSD side of things, HDD manufactures test their cache behavior quite thoroughly. This includes pulling the power immediately after flushing the cache to make sure the data made it to disk. 99% of people who report cases of HDDs &quot;lying&quot; about write integrity either have write cache enabled or are not actually issuing a flush cache command due to OS level issues.",1381345190
6523111,comment,6521517,6521721,2,0,smacktoward,,,"It&#x27;s actually worse than that. It&#x27;s not just that encryption isn&#x27;t enough, it&#x27;s that encryption can be <i>worse than no encryption</i>, since using encryption marks you out as someone who&#x27;s different than the vast majority of users on the network. In a world where normal people are happy to sling everything around in the clear, a person using any encryption at all flags themselves as potentially suspicious. (Not suspicious enough by itself to give a Western law enforcement agency what it needs to make a case against you -- but more than enough to convince less scrupulous actors like intelligence agencies that you&#x27;re a person deserving of a hard, hard look.)<p>Moreover, the more sophisticated the encryption you use, the more you set yourself apart from the crowd, further increasing your vulnerability.",1381345190

6523102,comment,6522269,6522269,7,0,derekp7,,,"For the &quot;busy work&quot; problem -- Let&#x27;s say you need to keep staff for certain job functions, which require a certain amount of institutional knowledge (so you can&#x27;t easily hire off the street for them).  And, you only need those skills periodically (once a month, a few times a year, etc).  What do you do with those people when they aren&#x27;t needed for the important periodic work, except to give them busy work that is somewhat related, to keep them skilled in that area?<p>Take the reports generation example in the article.  Now sure, those specific reports can be automated.  But everyone once in a while, they may want to issue new categories of reports.  Someone has to design them, and put out the initial prototypes.  And the people best qualified in designing them may be the ones manually generating them every month.  If you automate it, and employees eventually cycle out through attrition, then there may be no one left that remembers how to put that style of reports together.<p>So, how would you normally handle that type of situation, besides avoiding the automation so that this skill remains fresh in the institution? (i.e., you may assign this task to  each new crop of junior employees).<p>One example we had at a large telecom equipment manufacture I used to work at, was whenever someone new came into the group, the first thing you would have them do is physically inventory all the servers.  At that time, they were spread throughout the main data center, several data closets in a large building, and some were off site.  This ended up getting the new staff familiar with the equipment, and location, and how to navigate the building.  Even though we could have automated the inventory through software.",1381345050

6523093,comment,6521517,6522993,4,0,AnIrishDuck,,,"Traffic analysis is still possible under this scenario. It&#x27;s only marginally harder.<p>How would your magic traffic generator work? Randomly send a packet every minute? Not good enough, it&#x27;d be very easy to detect increased activity, which would be correlated to actual usage of the Tor network.<p>The best you could do is create some kind of Tor gateway that buffers packets. This gateway would always send n packets / minute through Tor in some programmatic pattern isolated from any packet input. If n real packets aren&#x27;t available, send fake packets in their place. This is further complicated by length analysis; you would need some way to limit the length of real outgoing packets (probably via MTU) and their data so length is indistinguishable from the fakes.<p>You should also avoid any sort of wireless connection to this gateway, as snoopers could detect this traffic from outside your residence and again break this scheme. And the whole scheme still falls apart if your adversary is willing / capable of entering your residence. Needless to say, many nation-state level adversaries are completely comfortable doing this.",1381344949

Unfortunately I think they are somewhat misleading, in that they don&#x27;t emphasize what exactly the threat is that these password crackers represent.<p>This is an offline attack that allows the attacker to recover the plaintext from hashes. In the context of the internet, the impact of this type of attack on the end-user can be almost entirely mitigated by using unique passwords on each site. A site which has leaked its password hashes is almost certainly already fully compromised, so having the password to that particular site gets the attacker not much. It&#x27;s only when those passwords are reused that recovering the plaintext becomes a big additional win for the attacker.<p>The implications of these articles is that you should use some super complicated random password. Indeed that&#x27;s a good idea. I personally use lastpass to generate long random passwords. But if there&#x27;s a choice between using one really good password all over the internet versus unique, but mediocre passwords on each site, the latter is a better choice. After all any particular site could be a honeypot or store your password in the clear.<p>On the flip side, if these articles are aimed at developers rather than end users, then they should be emphasizing using a modern key derivation function with an appropriate work factor.",1381343739

This has a pretty decent amount of FPGA fabric, and it could use an open source frame buffer to go along with the core. One of the hugely annoying things about Xilinx parts is that their design flow is insanely over complex.<p>That said, the comments here and elsewhere point out another interesting dichotomy. There are people who want a fully open Tegra4, and there are people who just want a frame buffer they can program. The latter is an undergraduate FPGA project, the former is a multi-million dollar team effort.<p>When the two groups talk about what needs to be done there are heated arguments of &#x27;too much&#x27; or &#x27;too little&#x27;.<p>These folks seem to have a design already &quot;done&quot; (in the sense that they have used it for some customers), I&#x27;m wondering if a more effective path might be to team up with Xilinx or Altera to put together some IP that that can be part of their design suites for free that would enable non-corporations to implement a decent frame buffer.

C-style macros (conceptually) work as a text pre-processor prior to the compiler&#x27;s lexing phase.  Lisp-style macros work on the syntax tree <i>after</i> the parse phase has finished.<p>In some Lisps, such as Common Lisp, macros are simply functions from syntax tree to syntax tree.  Since these execute at compile time, you can still run into the same types of problems you get with Perl&#x27;s BEGIN.  Scheme&#x27;s syntax-rules macros are more limited:  they cannot execute arbitrary code, but they can do pattern matching and substitution on syntax trees.  Despite this limitation, syntax-rules covers the vast majority of macro use cases.  The term rewriting systems in Haskell and Cat are reasonably similar.<p>My point to all of this is that macros are no justification for &quot;dynamic&quot; parsing.  The <i>only</i> distinction I can find of the two kinds of parsing is that a &quot;dynamic&quot; parser sometimes needs to execute bits of the program before it is able to progress.  This is not necessary for macros!<p>As far as parser combinators go, I conjecture that they will not be powerful enough to deal completely with Perl&#x27;s grammar.  In general, they&#x27;re limited to LL(k) grammars.  Still, you may be able to jump through some hoops to get what you want out of them.",1381342591

The core of hotel regulation stems from decades of hard-learned lessons - NYC&#x27;s lodging and housing laws are a mile long <i>because</i> they represent the tens of thousands of ways that landlords and hoteliers have discovered over centuries to fuck over their tenants.<p>Regulations also aren&#x27;t free. As we&#x27;ve added to housing regulation, compliance costs have risen, and like any other industry high regulatory compliance costs discourage competition from small businesses. Regulations also ensnare unintended targets, especially when they&#x27;ve been iteratively built upon over decades or centuries. Like code, it is difficult to predict the full behavior of a piece of legislation over a vast and complex economy.<p>This puts us in a tricky balancing act. We need regulation because we&#x27;ve observed the many, many ways an unregulated market tends to fuck over its own customers. We also need to limit regulation in order to preserve competition and avoid people getting screwed by the law even when they aren&#x27;t the intended targets of said laws.<p>There are, of course, malicious actors within the system on both sides. Those who seek to add regulations that have little to no public benefit, to further their own interests, and those who seek to remove necessary regulation to further theirs. The incumbent hotel industry tend to represent the former, and AirBnb represents the latter.

Death is two things: your mind stops being executed, and the information making up your mind is being destroyed. Neither of these things happens to an uploaded person if the upload is sufficiently recent. If you make a copy of yourself, they&#x27;re both you.

How will it feel to be duplicated? And the hidden assumption is that by describing the proposed weirdness of the feeling it will somehow contradict and disprove the feasibility of the whole concept.<p>What it feels like to be duplicated will very much depend on the external circumstances at that time. If you get run over by a bus and wake up in a piece of silicon, that&#x27;s how it will be.

Copying my brain won&#x27;t copy my conscious self.</i><p>... is a notion that I think is based on faulty assumptions. I&#x27;ve been trying to address why I believe this is only intuitively right but physically wrong in like 10 posts all over here against pretty much anyone who cared to comment, without a single voice of support.<p>I recognize I&#x27;m alone in this. I get this means I&#x27;m likely wrong about this, and you&#x27;re right in some way to assume that I just don&#x27;t understand (or to quote an email: don&#x27;t have the mental capacity nor the education required to understand).<p>I don&#x27;t understand how, once you introduce the concept of making an adequate copy, that still means there is an &quot;original&quot; and a &quot;copy&quot; which somehow isn&#x27;t another instance of the original. I don&#x27;t understand why the concept of making a copy is fine when we&#x27;re talking about, say, a piece of text but then immediately seizes to be valid when we&#x27;re talking about minds.<p>Collectively, you guys tried to make me understand by invoking several things. For example, the argument was raised that because you <i>obviously</i> can&#x27;t have several instances of your consciousness at the same time, this can never work. There was the argument that any would-be left-over physical body somehow remains the home of the mind, and there would <i>obviously</i> be an impostor around pretending to be me but ultimately not <i>being</i> me. At two points, it was suggested that I (specifically, I, Udo) be killed to prove that I care about my existence and the existence of forks based on me, which I do and which does not really have any meaningful connection to the question of the feasibility of copying. I also said that the &quot;problem&quot; of the left-over body most likely won&#x27;t arise due to technical limitations of the process. Still, that didn&#x27;t count and people still think that uploading minds is like building pyramids. Finally, the argument was made that both instances are by necessity different, if only because they occupy a different positions in space, to which I tried to explain that, yes, they&#x27;re different and they&#x27;ll continue to become more different over time, and yet that doesn&#x27;t have any real bearing on the proposed possibility or impossibility of the whole concept.<p>This is where I apologize and withdraw from the discussion. You certainly tried to explain it harder than most people here, but in the end that didn&#x27;t work out. I&#x27;m old enough to have the strong feeling that at some point in the future, a populist Kurzweil 2.0 will come along and everybody will just come around to this conclusion as if it had just been invented.<p>And that&#x27;s fine with me. I don&#x27;t need to be right, but I do want to have the option of being uploaded. Repulsion to the very idea is deeply ingrained within our society. Attempts to prolong life are virtually unknown outside horror literature where it&#x27;s always portrayed as monstrous. Even &quot;progressive&quot; sites such as io9 draw the line here. It goes against the foundation of most religions, and it contradicts the intuition of most people.<p>Of all things, a Buffy quote comes to mind here, allow me to paraphrase it: &quot;You&#x27;ll live again, but it won&#x27;t be <i>you</i>. A demon sets up in your body, having your memories and thinking your thoughts, but you&#x27;ll be gone.&quot; - I think this sums up the opinion of most people when it comes to transhumanism. And once again, you&#x27;re right, I struggle to understand this at every level.",1381342105

6522767,comment,6520398,6522077,4,0,rprospero,,,"I love computational research more than most, seeing as I&#x27;m a scientist and a coder.  However, I feel the need to weigh in with a counterpoint on this.  I&#x27;ve spent the last eight years measuring a system that was well described by both theory and computational experiments.  It was exactly one of those systems where the results could not be measured experimentally and simulation was the only path forward.<p>We then built an instrument which could measure the results experimentally.  Since this system was so well described by simulation and theory, we used it as a calibration sample before doing real science.  Except the results didn&#x27;t match the computations at all.<p>I spent years tracking down problems in the instrument (some of which were real) before finally setting in on the fact that the theory and calculations were simply wrong.  Just as you&#x27;re always experimentally limited in what you can measure, you&#x27;re resource constrained in what you can calculate.  Sometimes, you need to drop down another physics abstraction level before you can get the right answer.  However, experiments don&#x27;t care about your abstraction level and get it right every time.<p>Performing physical experiments is a waste of time and money if you can just simulate the results.  However, you don&#x27;t know if you can simulate it until you&#x27;ve performed the experiment.  Every scientist I&#x27;ve known has, at least once, run a simulation and later found that it wasn&#x27;t even close to the experimental results.  Sometimes it&#x27;s a leaky abstraction in the simulation (e.g. Ignoring the anti-reflective coating on a mirror).  Sometimes it&#x27;s a leaky abstraction in the experiment (e.g. ignoring the pH differences between H2O and D2O).  Sometimes it&#x27;s new physics, but not very often.  Sometimes it&#x27;s exactly like you predicted.  Until you leave the keyboard and enter the lab, you won&#x27;t know.",1381341859

And most developers would prefer it honestly. But currently Ford&#x27;s System is build on Top of WindowsCE running on a PowerPC chip (which is basically custom for Ford I believe (thus the microsoft sync), I don&#x27;t work in CE a lot so I don&#x27;t know a ton about it).<p>Originally the &#x27;Sync&#x27; system was going to not only handle info-tainment oriented stuff but car diagnostic information such as Valve timing and engine firing. The problem was the scope of the project was to large, and caused way to much CPU load, I believe its roughly a 600Mhz PPC chip, very under powered for the task at hand, not to mention windowsCE is a <sarcasm> LOVELY </sarcasm> development environment to work in (I know this first hand, different dependencies for a debug-able, and non-debug-able binary just make my heart sing with joy).<p>The problem they faced was that info-tainment system errors would cause it to short restart, or hang... just general stupidity due to first gen software problems. But when your also running your knock sensor on a different thread of your &#x27;info-tainment&#x27; CPU, things get &#x27;real&#x27; very very fast. How bad? Well when the computer when buggy the motor would default into &#x27;prevent knock mode&#x27; and suddenly every single cylinder started firing 5+ degrees into the down stroke to prevent engine knock even if timing was correct3-4 degree&#x27;s prior was proper timing. So they moved engine control away to a different tried and true processor.<p>Now whats left is this really buggy thing that limps along H/A&#x27;ing media, and giving you some car starts since its still technically on the CAN bus (which industrial busses are completely open source, you can thank people from the 1970&#x27;s-80&#x27;s for that, not out of &#x27;creating a community&#x27; but so you can figure out what&#x27;s being sent with a 19200baud scope, and an ASCII look up chart). So its &#x27;buggy&#x27; but the WinCE on PPC was partially sponsored by Microsoft, who gets free advertising for keeping WindowsCE alive for Ford.<p>There are rumblings in GM to move to a Linux plate form because the developers are practically on strike over stuff like this, but GM moves very very slowly, and is more bureaucratic then the US government a times, so don&#x27;t expect this to become a &#x27;thing&#x27; in a time-span less then 10-15 years, because that&#x27;s about how fast &#x27;new&#x27; things get integrated into cars around the Big 3.<p>I&#x27;m rooting for you guys on the second floor.",1381341787

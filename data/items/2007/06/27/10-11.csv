(Over 5 years, front-loaded, through refundable state income tax credits.  Credits against taxes owed, not deductions from taxable income.  And refundable, meaning if credits exceed debts, the state will cut a check to the taxpayer.)<p>So it works likes this: Investors give you money.  The state gives it back to them.  Any amount you do not piss away is profit for them.  Am I missing something?  Why haven't I heard of this before?<p>Side note: Any other n.ycers in Hawaii?  If so, anyone going to the Hawaii Venture Capital Association lunch this Thursday?",1182938749

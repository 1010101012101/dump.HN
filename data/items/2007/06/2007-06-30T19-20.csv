You can forget about coding for the first 10-12 days or so while you acclimatize (or at least I found it very very hard). And if you don't initiate yourself exactly right  you'll find you've wasted a whole month just getting dog tired. <p>While you do suddenly seem to get a lot of time it makes any kind of socializing hard since you have to sleep every 3-4 hours.  Even after a couple of months if I missed one sleep session I would hit a massive wall and all coding would come  to a stop. <p>Lack of time can sometimes be a good thing. It forces you into creative solutions. The funny thing is, although I produced more lines of code during the polyphasic experiment     
 I think the quality suffered (not much but when I look over those pieces it always seems I could have structured it better). I don't know what to attribute that to since I didn't feel any different while coding in or out of the polyphasic state after the ramp up period.

Restricting your naps to 20mins or less prevents you from entering the deep sleep stages which make you groggy and tired. Just take them more frequently, like 4-5 hrs apart.<p>It may sound ridiculous but i've found it pretty effective. Even though I'm moonlighting I still code for almost as long as someone doing it full time (assuming ~8hrs sleep). Work can still get in the way though so I understand your decision.<p>The big plus (at least early on in your project) is that it takes the pressure of worrying about your burn rate off...

Sharing the load is good and a co-founder is a good energizer/motivator.<p>I'm not entirely clear why you incorporated....  Definitely something you want to do, but why not wait a bit and see if what you build sticks/takes off?<p>My last startup was an ""off-hours"" thing, and my current one was an off-hours thing for the last few months (and is a full-time effort as of monday).

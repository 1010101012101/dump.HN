He made a legitimate name for himself in the early days building buildings and not just selling t-shirts. I think what sets him apart from other billionaire businessmen is the amount of ego he shows while doing it. There are investors in casinos, golf courses and Manhattan residential buildings who are more successful than Trump who's name we don't know. Also Trump is a bit bombastic about certain topics such as politics, going on and on about birth certificates 4 years after the President was elected.<p>Another person who is similar is Sir Richard Branson, who often jumps out of planes and such in order to make a grand entrance into a press conference, while having several Virgin businesses that outright fail (such as Virgin Charter, the jet timeshare, and Virgin Record Stores) that we don't hear about so much.

Maybe many extremely entrepreneurial people don't respect the law. In Zuckerberg's case it does seem like he doesn't care about patents at all whereas Aaron is still mad about the IP and hates that Zuckerberg ignored the rules (re: patents, Facemash, dropping out, and everything else) and got rewarded for it.<p>Reading the logs I don't get the sense Zuckerberg is being dishonest or that he even considers Aaron to be a friend. The main conflict seems to be the accusation that Zuckerberg stole ideas, which is a big question for software in general: ideas want to spread so the concept of IP is arguably against the nature of ideas. At the same time, we want people to be able to get rich off a great idea even if they don't implement it successfully. This question re: IP and copyrights is something we're still resolving as a society. Until it gets resolved,  if ever, lots of people are going to have lots of unfair things happen to them and it's understandable to be mad about that.<p>But that's what life is: unfair. Just like we can't go through life feeling guilty about how lucky we are to have survived infancy unlike some absurd percentage of humans in poor countries, we can't constantly hate on other people who are even luckier than we are re: how they don't deserve their success. No one deserves anything. Life is unfair.",1348098736

As of early 2011, the under-development version of CompCert is the only compiler we have tested for which Csmith cannot nd wrong-code errors. This is not for lack of trying: we have devoted about six CPU-years to the task. The apparent unbreakability of CompCert supports a strong argument that developing compiler optimizations within a proof framework, where safety checks are explicit and machine-checked, has tangible benets for compiler users.""

This I feel is one of Facebook's core problems, where for them to maximize the value of their dataset, their ad targeting becomes incredibly creepy.<p>One issue is that from an end users perspective it makes it obvious how much information is being captured about them.  While most people are aware that their information is being captured, seeing it plastered all over their facebook feed makes them confront it.<p>Worse than that are the questions that come with these ads - ""Why am I seeing ads for baldness cures?""  Is it because I'm a 30+ male, or is it because they have analysed photos I'm tagged in and detected my thinning hair?  Sometimes it just feels mean!<p>This is primarily a challenge of data science working in a marketing environment and doesn't really permeate through all areas of data science, however it is the form of data science that is most visible.

Being that I love websites that leverage currently large social networks, love niches, and myself love coffee I thought I would test out the hypothesis that users want to share their coffee experiences with other users in a coffee niched social environment.
I set out and built the current prototype for socialatte.com from Ruby on Rails (one because I knew the framework and another because it is good for quickly getting something up) as well as used twitter bootstrap for responsive design (needed it to work in mobile browsers). Took about a couple days of work but got it to where it is today.<p>I had added instagr.am support and now, as of today, ios6 users have the option of file uploads where they can take a picture from there directly. Now all is said and done, I have been trying to market this via social networks and having very little luck drawing in users. My analytics report is getting an average of... 10-20 users a day?<p>I am doing something fundamentally wrong marketing wise or my hypothesis is proven invalid... which I think that is far too early to tell. I am sort of stuck on where to go from here.

Someone made a robotic bartender using Arduino that had an iPad app that would let you choose drinks.  It could mix from 16 ingredients and accept payments from Venmo.  The best part is that team didn't bring the hardware to the event (minus the Uno board), they spent 24 of the  48 hours scrambling around Philly buying things (they're from Michigan).

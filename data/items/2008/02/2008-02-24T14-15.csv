122491,comment,122287,122486,0,0,NSX2,,,"Sure.  Just off the top of my mind, right after Katrina he wrote on op-ed in I think the WSJ where he does the usual ""This is horrible ... but"" and then suggests that rather than rebuilding public schools, now would be a good time to let the public schools rot and instead use the money that would have been build on schools as grants to be used as vouchers for private schools.<p>By coincidence, a ton of companies were just formed to do just that - build and setup private schools.<p>The residents got the vouchers, they gave them to the companies that would have built the schools.<p>Only problem is that the residents are mostly still displaced or living in trailer-parks surrounded by ""privatized security forces"" which make them seem more like they're quarantined, and the companies that said they wanted to build the private schools took the money but no building was ever started.<p>It seems you can't build fancy private schools and just have poor displaced people whose kids haven't gone to school in a year or so.  No sir - you need some affluent people in the mix as well.<p>And affluent people don't like to live in New-Orleans type of shambles - they want luxury coops and private, gated communities of newly constructed townhouses, and malls and shopping centers and business districts, etc.<p>Wouldn't you know it, by some coincidence tons of new partnerships and LPs and LLCs were setup JUST RECENTLY to develop all these ritzy things so that the upscale private schools would feel more comforatable in their surroundings.<p>So the government transferred rebuilding money to private companies which either rebuilt nothing yet or are planning to build things that the people the rebuilding money was designated for could never afford.<p>So milton suggested change after tragedy, but his change benefited the rich and politically well connected, not the people affected by the tragedy - even though that's what it was initially passed off as.<p>>> And how would you propose to ""let his suggestion actually be put to the test of a real democratic free market"" - where would you find such a real democratic free market?<p>Well, easy.  Take the people affected by Katrina - let the shock wear off so they can think clearly, then simply ask them: instead of building you guys public schools and hospitals and such, the government wants to take tax money and give private contracts to companies that want to build upscale private schools and malls and gated communities and such - you know, stuff you could never afford to live in yourselves.<p>How bout it?  Also, would you like to sell your land off really cheap to these new luxury developers?  Oh, wait - you don't have a choice because the government declared it a federal disaster zone.<p>So - for rebuilding purposes, the government declares the area a disaster zone, no rebuilding will take place.<p>But if you and I started a LLC and declared an intention to build upscale gated communities, maybe a corporate headquarters complex or two, etc., all of a sudden, the government not only lets us but even GRANTS us tax money to do just that.<p>What resident of New Orleans do you think would have thought this arrangement to be a good idea in their self interest?<p>I'm guessing none.",1203864807

122488,comment,122287,122470,0,0,NSX2,,,"Okay, I'm sorry too be harsh in response.<p>But I think this is on topic for the simple fact that most people here I would classify as being interested in working on or eventually starting a startup.  Which I think they hope will either sell a product, or have an IPO or get bought out.<p>So whether you like it or not, your dream of a startup is dependent on the macro-system.<p>The reason I posted this is because I'm in the same boat.  I've been trying to put together a startup, I've had training in economics, and I was sort of brainwashed to believe growing up that hard work = success and good idea = market adaption and people at the top = hard work and good ideas.<p>This view of the world that people at the top dominate certain market mechanisms and they do so because they take advantage of disaster and face no natural competition and opposition makes me pause and think about my own experience and I thought it might be food for thought for others.<p>For example, why should I work hard to present an idea that I hope will beat competition and be adopted democratically in a free market system because it's the better idea, when there's a good chance that the eventual winner will be a well-connected group that sneaks it's market entry in when I'm scared and distracted because, say, terrorists run amock in my city?<p>If that's the way the world works, then ALL free market endeavor is lost because the system will tend to collapse because there will be no motivation to compete in a system where winners don't compete but rather cause problems for their competition and sneak solutions while we're all distracted and putting out fires.<p>That affects everyone - including programmers.",1203863805
122487,comment,122106,122106,0,0,michael_nielsen,,,"A dissenting view<p>It's true that, as the article and many commenters have said,there are lots of bad places, and bad cultures within academia.<p>So what?  There's also some great groups and great cultures within academia.   If you want to go the academic path, the thing to do is to make sure you end up in such a place.  So far as I can see the way to achieve this is:<p>(1) Do a lot of research before you join a group.  Just because a group looks great from the outside (brand name University, famous prof) doesn't mean it'll be a good experience.  Interview former members; tour the lab; ask hard questions about the culture - what do people love about their jobs; what do they think is the worst thing about the culture; what do they think about their career prospects? Follow up on these questions in detail - most people love to talk about their careers, and if they won't, it often means that they're not happy. If you get defensive responses, or a refusal to respond, that tells you what you need to know about the culture.  Don't look back.<p>(2) Iterate until you find a group that looks excellent.<p>(3) Mentally, when you join a group, think of it as being on probation.  After three and then six months, ask yourself ""Am I having fun?  Is what I'm doing making a difference?  Is the culture here genuinely good?""  If the answer to all these questions isn't yes, get out, and go join another group.  This is hard to do - you'll get a lot of advice to the contrary - but 9 times out of 10 the results are a major improvement.<p>I'm leaving academia now, after PhD, postdocs, being a tenured prof, the whole nine yards.  It was tough at times, but overall, it was an asbolute blast.",1203863641

122482,comment,122476,122476,0,0,NSX2,,,"You know, this smacks a bit of ""Me thinks the lady doth protest too much.""<p>Ideas are a dime a dozen.  But good ideas are not.  If you already have the skills as a developer, and good, marketable, monetizable ideas are really as easy to come up with as you say, why aren't you a multi-billionaire 15 times over by now?<p>I suppose I'm a bit biased because I've approached people before as the ""idea guy"", only to be turned down by developers who insist that ideas are a dime-a-dozen and that they're too busy working on their own wonderful get-rich-quick idea to make billions of dollars by starting a company which loads YouTube flash videos up 2% faster or some such technical marvel.<p>You know what?  Year after year, same developers, same cocktail party, same meetups, STILL working in poverty and obscurity, 100% certain that any day now Google will come along and offer them billion$$$ for their one-man company centered around an algorithm that loads YouTube videos 2% faster.<p>I highly doubt that you're a several-time succesful entrepreneur as you claim on your site.<p>Startups are just plain hard and you need all the good thinkers you can get and they're not all programmers.<p>Good luck competing with the luxury of snobbery.<p>BTW - suppose this non-existent guy's business idea (I say that because it seems like every programmer these days is posting a blog about, ""The other day, this stupid guy came up to me asking to develop his stupid idea."") took off and made billions.<p>Do you have experience developing products for startups that go on to make billioins?<p>Did Pierre Omidyar have experience programming for startups that go from $0 in sales to become Fortune 500 companies in less than a decade?<p>Let me know how your holier-than-thou attitude works out for you financially in about 10-15 years.<p>I'm going to guess you'll either still be programming or putting up some blog whining about how Indian and Chinese programmers are stealing your opportunities.",1203862781

122479,comment,122287,122461,0,0,NSX2,,,">> but could it not simply be that his work was motivated by trying to improve human lives? It is pretty natural to consider in the face of disaster what might have caused it and what might have prevented it.<p>But that's the thing.  He SAYS he believes in the free market, which means, in my mind, put up an idea and see who takes to it, but in PRACTICE he basically means, ""People are too stupid to know what's good for them - so we'll shove changes down their throats when they least suspect it and are the most distracted.""<p>The thing that may distrub you (I'm a bit more familiar with friedman) is that his ""solutions"" have nothing to do with the crisis itself, or, as you say, preventing it.  He has said numerous times that ""free market solutions"" are the best way to lift people out of poverty en masse.<p>Yet, his particular suggestions are not aimed at ""solutions"" for most people but rather opportunities for a select few.<p>The fact that they have to be slipped in sneakily while nobody's paying attention because they're too scared and trying to survive makes me suspicious - if all the things that he advocates should be quietly sneaked in while we're too traumatized from disaster to pay attention were as good for us as he claims, why then do they have to be snuck in quietly while we're all reduced to fear an panic and can't think straight?<p>In other words, why not let his suggestion actually  be put to the test of a real democratic free market - why does he insist that ""free market solutions"" are best introduced during times of fear and panic and by using stealth and secrecy and decption?<p>Could it be that none of his ""free market solutions"" would ever actually be successful in a properly functioning free market?<p>If so, could it be that the people at the top of the food chain don't really want a properly functioning free market where people make rational decisions based on self-interest?<p>>> It happens all the time, in fact, it is standard practice when starting wars to fake some attack of the enemy to be first. That is not what we are discussing, though.<p>But in a way it is.  Once you accept the possibility that people are willing to exploit tragedy to push their agendas on a weakened populace, then the next step in the economic model is to make ""progress"" of that sort more efficient and business like by being able to predict and prepare for such scenarios in advance - and the only way to have the sufficient knowledge necessary to do this is to somehow have asymetric distrubtion of knowledge of such events a priori, which suggests that people who have such knowledge would be colluding with the people who cause the disasters.<p>> Also, let's think the other way round. Naomi seems to

There was a time when everyone thought Apple would rule the world with the Mac, it was so much better than DOS, and then MS came roaring back with windows, then people thought Apple was down for the count and they came roaring back with the the Ipod and Iphone. Sure some companies drift into obscurity and go out of business while new ones come on the scene (eg. Google) but the really good ones figure out a way to become relevant again (e.g. IBM, Watson etc.). It will be interesting to see if MS is able to do the same. I hope so, we still need some big companies like that that are willing to invest huge sums of money on research, it cannot all be done with start ups.",1373842799

For some things you&#x27;re going to have to _write_ to disk... like captured video. (I wouldn&#x27;t consider that to be the &quot;real-time&quot; part of the software, though.) And you might have to read from disk occasionally... maybe you have map information stored there... but that probably doesn&#x27;t need to be real-time. Can you tell me an example where you would need to read from disk in real-time?

The best, most practical part of a good English course is the close reading training, but it really needs to be applied to something practical, as opposed to languishing in a course most students and teachers don&#x27;t take very seriously.<p>I don&#x27;t care if eighteen-year-olds never read Hawthorne again if it means fewer of them get ripped off by unfair contracts or suckered by misleading ads.<p>Shop class should be folded into Adult Living in its entirety, and the &#x27;make a birdhouse&#x27; stuff should be de-emphasized and replaced with &#x27;fixing your toilet&#x27; and similar household maintenance tasks.

6042565,comment,6041559,6042141,2,0,rm999,,,"Yeah, the article is kind of sloppily organized and laid out. Here&#x27;s the main message I got from the article:<p>In online advertising you want to measure your success through the rate of causal events, i.e. I advertised to someone and he converted (e.g. bought a product) because he saw the ad. Many advertisers use a correlative proxy for this by looking at how many products they are selling vs how much they are advertising (I advertised more and sold more, so my advertising is effective). The problem is there is a confounding factor that is unrelated to the effectiveness of an ad that causes people to both see more ads and buy more of your product, called the activity bias. The more actively people are surfing the internet at any given time, the more ads they will see, but also the more shopping they would have done anyway. In other words, a lot of the increase in sales are not being cause BY the ads, but for the same reason there are more ads being shown.<p>The solution is a control group of people who are never shown an ad. During higher-activity times both the control group and the in-group will be purchasing more products, but if an ad is truly effective the in-group should be purchasing even more than the control group. Without the control you can&#x27;t measure effectiveness because you don&#x27;t have a ground truth.",1373842136

6042482,comment,6041765,6041971,9,0,derefr,,,"> Systems that dont scale, or that are reliant on the grunt work of humans, are not part of the training of engineers either. For so many engineers, an unscalable, human-dependant system is a bug, not a feature.<p>There&#x27;s a specific discipline within Engineering, of people who put together technology with employee training manuals, company policies, and sometimes even incentive structures which bring into existence entire markets, to make sure a process is carried out. These people are called Systems Engineers.<p>A typical Systems Engineering problem: design a satellite launch mission. Piece out the work, the calculations, the part sourcing, the safety checks, etc., so no part (human or computer) will malfunction or &quot;jam&quot; without a redundant backup being ready to take over. Make sure all work and outputs have been checked. Make sure all people, parts, and processes for doing the checking have been checked, and are regularly maintained. And make sure all relevant processes are adaptable to changing demands in the future, so this mission design can be reused to build and launch another satellite, later, even if we don&#x27;t have the same companies to source parts from, or the same employees, or even the same satellite. Make sure all this <i>making sure</i> continues to happen after you&#x27;re gone, without anyone in particular needing to keep the whole thing in their head--because that&#x27;s way above tolerance for an average human &quot;part&quot; in your System.<p>A Systems Engineer&#x27;s work, especially at the prototyping phase, involves just as much talking to and convincing customers and partners, providing training and walking through use-cases, as it does writing code or doing calculations or building models.<p>You might have guessed where I was going with this. Start-ups are indeed Systems Engineering problems, and really, they need Systems Engineers to build them. I would say it&#x27;s a shame that we consider someone an Engineer at all without training in Systems Engineering; it really is the holistic body of training tying all the other Engineering disciplines together. A Civic Engineer could model a bridge, but a Civic Engneer with Systems Engineering training can model the structure of the maintenance contracts required to upkeep the bridge, and find the most cost-effective incentive to encourage people to avoid trying to take their oversized cargo boats through the pass. In a way, Systems Enigneering has a lot in common with Game Design--just with the proviso that the &quot;game&quot; is played by real people as an aspect of their real, every-day lives, instead of writhin a voluntary Magic Circle of play.<p>I should note, though, that as a Systems Engineering problem, &quot;starting a start-up&quot; has a unique property--rather than being built and then launched, start-ups are launched, <i>and then built</i>. A startup is basically a partially-designed seed System, which has just enough utility to &quot;live&quot; (it&#x27;s Minimally Viable!), and which will then require more Systems Engineering to be done &quot;in-flight&quot; (customer discovery/pivoting) to keep them viable. This necessitates a Systems Engineer actually be a <i>component</i> of the seed System, as architected, at least until the System reaches a state of maturity (which is precisely defined as the point at which a Systems Engineer is no longer needed for the System to avoid &quot;running down.&quot;<p>If you&#x27;ll indulge me in a metaphor, a start-up is like a modern fighter plane. It used to be that, having lost power, a plane could simply continue to glide toward its current (ballistic) trajectory, because it had <i>static stability</i>. However, it turned out that statically-stable designs had weaknesses (warping under sufficient torsional forces, for example) and to increase manouverability past a certain point, static stability would have to be sacrificed. In a modern jet fighter, then, we have a plane constantly tending toward shaking itself apart--and a set of electronics giving it continuous micro-adjustments so it won&#x27;t. In other words, we have a System that can only function as long as there is an intelligent agent adjusting and tuning it from within.<p>--where the parallel breaks down, of course, is that a fighter plane flown for long enough doesn&#x27;t continue to grow until it becomes a Boeing. But then, if they had aviation control electronics as intelligent as a Systems Engineer, I don&#x27;t see how getting a fighter plane to pick up parts, join them to itself, and expand out until it could fly passengers five days a weeks would be an <i>intrinsically harder</i> problem than turning an idea in your head into AirBnB.<p>One thing you should be able to notice from my description above: there&#x27;s no reason the Systems Engineer <i>running</i> a start-up, has to be the one who designed the start-up&#x27;s seed System in the first place. I would say that the whole point of a start-up &quot;incubator&quot; like YCombinator is to do most of the Systems Engineering work in constructing viable seeds--including picking good teams of Systems Engineers to run them. That the people executing on their Systems are frequently the ones to suggest the initial idea for the seed System they end up working on is more an artefact of human-nature+ than anything to do with YC&#x27;s business model as such. I would flip the role terminology around: YC <i>engineers</i> the seeds; then the founders--part of the constructed seed System--incubate it, until it no longer needs continuous System Engineering for its ensured viability. (At which point the founders either give up on being Systems Engineers, or leave to start something else.<p>Another fun analogy: a start-up requires the care of its founders in the same way a fortis requires the environment of the womb. This would make YC an IVF clinic--though with some aspects of a pre-natal care facility as well. :)<p>+ Less cynically, YC can be said to just be making the capitalist assumption that knowledge of what the economy wants is distributed among the people on the ground in each domain. That&#x27;s assuming the founders <i>have</i> knowledge of their domain...",1373840537

You can have new hires, you can lose people and you can get code written by others that you have to maintain (especially the case with CPAN).<p>I agree this is also a problem with domain knowledge.  The second you commit something to your code base the clock starts ticking.  The further away from your own code, the harder it is to have context and the more difficult it is to fix problems.  If you feel like you can jump back in to your Perl code easily after a prolonged absence, by all means, do it.  My point was only that in Perl, it&#x27;s easy to use many different idioms which not all coders are familiar with.  This can make debugging more difficult.",1373839605

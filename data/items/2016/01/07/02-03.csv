In your example, both of the conversations lead to people meeting face-to-face, but only one of them could be done while on a bus, or in between work meetings. Text-based communication enabled us to talk in situations when it wasn&#x27;t possible before. I fondly remember late-night IM talks with my friends when I was in high-school. This is not something we could do on the phone, both because of stupidly high costs and because other people in our houses were sleeping.<p>RE most people solving their own problems, I think that&#x27;s a) good, and b) not what actually happens. Good, because it means less time wasted for everyone in aggregate; not what really happens, because the world is getting more complicated and people delegate more and more understanding to third parties.

That&#x27;s a great point actually. Maybe the solution is just to have the public provide and support this &quot;fiber pipe&quot;. Not the fiber; Just the pipe. This would lower the barriers to competition for last mile connectivity. I still think this ought to be insulated from the upstream connectivity providers. To continue the analogy: The cables are self-driving uber-like taxies and the pipe is the rode. I want regulation to ensure every taxi is totally interoperable with every private freeway/bridge/airline in a given area. I also want the option to just use the taxi for local services. I don&#x27;t want a taxi cartel to tell me where to shop.<p><i>I live in a Western European country. This is not how it works here.</i><p>Okay. I&#x27;m pretty ignorant about these issues.

Well, especially Riposte, as it is a system where users post their messages via N servers out of which K servers should be trusted. It seems like Riposte can be easily adopted for this use case. Operators can decide to de-anonymize messages and consensus of any K operators is enough.",1452132393

Math, software, public speaking, writing, comedy, business = Dev Advocate at a bitcoin company. I&#x27;m not great at any of them individually, but good enough at all of them to make a great Developer Advocate. Took a while to convince someone to take a risk on me (I had a technical Biz Dev/PM background prior to my current job) but finally got a company to interview me the right way...they had me present to 20 bitcoin devs about their API as part of the process, and I happily can say I knocked it out of the park. Barring any sudden discovery of me as a stand-up comedian/writer (unlikely at this point) I&#x27;m very very happy to make a long, fruitful career of this role.<p>Anyway, TL;DR: there are always ways to combine software with other skills. The hard part is finding the role that incorporates all of them (whether you invent it as a founder or join someone else).",1452132368

How about the electrical grid? Water? Sewage? Local infrastructure isn&#x27;t a fungible commodity. If it were then traffic jams and blackouts wouldn&#x27;t be a thing. Also, local demand isn&#x27;t scalable. You only need one road outside your house. Several competing roads would be horribly underutilized on the low end of scale. On the high end you&#x27;re maybe onto something. Private bridges and freeways may be a decent idea. Private airlines certainly are. But then you&#x27;re right back to what I&#x27;m advocating.<p>My point was actually that when the inherently monopolistic aspect is factored out the free market can flourish. This is how it works in Europe. Governments provide the &quot;last mile&quot; connectivity. ISPs compete to provide access to the outside world. This competition isn&#x27;t possible if the local infrastructure is owned by an ISP. They are incentivized to shut down the free market and reap their monopolistic rewards. They lock down their infrastructure. This creates a huge barrier to entry. They can then: Overcharge. Inspire competition. Crush them with their accumulated capital. Overcharge... Anyone attempting to compete is necessarily constructing redundant infrastructure. The &quot;zero government involvement&quot; thing actually hinders the free market here. Our road system enables tremendous free market enterprise. If retailers had to pay a road cartel for the right to do business it would be a disaster. Walmart would take over the roads and overpower anything it cared to which depended on them. Basically what Facebook is trying to do in India.",1452132140

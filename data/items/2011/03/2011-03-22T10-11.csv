There are no written materials whatsoever and this is intentional. Dr. Pimsleur's reasoning was that you should learn to pronounce and understand a language before learning to read it, lest you pick up bad habits which will be difficult to lose further down the line.<p>The courses were designed to teach the most frequently used words in any given language (such as numbers, movement verbs etc.) through sample conversations and drills. Spaced repetition is used to enhance memory.<p>From the wikipedia entry:<p>""The student listens to a recording on which native speakers speak phrases in both the foreign language and the language used for teaching (usually English). At varying intervals, the student is prompted to repeat a phrase after the speaker finishes it. The student is then introduced to a new phrase and the meaning is explained. After repeating several times, the student is asked to repeat a previous phrase, along with integrating vocabulary from the new one. More new phrases are introduced, while old phrases are prompted at random, so as to aid long term memory.""<p>I highly recommend the courses, although the downside is that they ain't free.",1300790239

To the best of my knowledge, the fundamental assumption behind the QC paradigm, the Copenhagen Interpretation, has never really been tested.[1]  It is possible that a device like this will constitute the definitive test.  The question will be whether such a system can actually perform a calculation across a superposition of states.  In the systems I am aware of where such a calculation has been claimed, what actually happened was that a large number of atoms were manipulated simultaneously, and the ""superposition"" was potentially across the specific states in those individual atoms.<p>My own opinion is that the QC scenario is a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> for the Copenhagen Interpretation, and that when a true QC calculation is set up, it will fail.  This is actually an optimistic view, because the Copenhagen Interpretation is a fundamentally pessimistic assumption: that because we <i>don't</i> know what's behind a certain observed random distribution, we <i>can't</i>.  See the following link for more details.  (But IAMAP, and I'm not really keeping up with this area.)<p>[1]  For more on how the Copenhagen Interpretation evolved, and just how little empirical basis there is for it, see <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=tTN4HuUNXjgC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA328#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=tTN4HuUNXjgC&lpg=PP1&#3...</a>",1300789565

We've achieved best-case $1.5/subscriber and we accepted ads that achieved $3.5 or less per subscriber.  We eliminated more than 290 ads that did not achieve our 1.5 to 3.5 / acquisition goal.<p>We found that the factors that mattered most for achieving our ad goals on facebook were:
1.  Targeting to users with specific likes/interests.
2.  The imagery in the ads<p>FYI.  Google ads have achieved best-case $7/subscriber so we stopped using them.",1300788812

Drew Houston is a brilliant guy, but let's be honest most people only recognized his true brilliance after he became successful. (I think most people thought he is smart, but I doubt most people thought he is brilliant before his success.)<p>So yes, you should invest into people, but the trick is to recognize brilliance in advance. Which is brutally hard. For example recognizing technical brilliance if someone is not technical is almost impossible. I think where YC shines is not only that they try to invest into people but that they are actually quite good at recognizing brilliance. (I doubt they are perfect in this, but probably the best in the market.)",1300788752

8753586,comment,8753315,8753315,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"This story really highlights just how far the media witch hunt against Uber has gone. The story basically calls out Uber for its surge pricing strategy which kicked in during a siege in a Sydney, Australia cafe. People in the area were clearing out and catching Uber&#x27;s. Because of the increased demand, Uber&#x27;s automatic surge pricing kicked in.<p>This story makes it sound like Uber deliberately turned on surge pricing to capitalise on what was going on, which is not the case. Those who have used Uber before know this is an automatic mechanism, simple supply and demand, which in most cases makes sense. It is just unfortunate that this happened when this hostage crisis was taking place.<p>Surge pricing is and always has been an automatic thing. It isn&#x27;t something that someone in an Uber office switches on when they notice an increase in demand or a crisis going on they can take advantage of. Uber are a pretty questionable company who have done some rather questionable things, in this situation, Uber did everything right (for the most part).<p>While I understand the fear is real from some of the people fleeing, the people actually being held captive in cafe were the ones we should be focusing on, not the people fleeing who were safe surrounded by. Calling an Uber in a crisis is the last thing I would honestly be doing, I would be calling an actual taxi because I know there are more taxis than Uber&#x27;s in Sydney.<p>As unfortunate as it might be, the system works for the most part. Obviously there were a lack of vehicles in the vicinity of the siege, the system realised this and compensated by increasing the cost. The alternative in this situation if there was no surge pricing, there would be no additional vehicles to meet the demand which means people have no transport. It is also worth noting the drivers get paid more when surge pricing is in effect, the incentive of more money brings drivers from further away into the area.<p>And you know what, once Uber found out what was happening, they made all rides in the Sydney area free which they didn&#x27;t have to do. Does this sound the like an action of a company trying to capitalise on a crisis? I don&#x27;t think so. If Uber didn&#x27;t reverse surge pricing in the area, then yes, I would be calling them out like everyone else, but as soon as they noticed, they made all rides free and offered refunds to anyone charged surge prices. Anything for a story, right?<p>I think Uber could have handled the PR around this so much better, especially keeping the public in the loop around complexities (if any) of turning off surge pricing or making rides free. I think this also highlights Uber need to consider pricing caps on surge pricing, a 4x increase is just ridiculous crisis or no crisis. I have heard of some parts of the US which have hit a 6x increase before and then Uber intervenes and caps it.<p>A fine piece of shoddy journalism. Shame on you Washington Post and every other media outlet making this into a far bigger issue than it actually is.",1418669597

As an anecdote I&#x27;m 183 cm (or 6&quot;) and I actually find it really
uncomfortable to sit at the optional incline offered by airlines, I&#x27;d

</code></pre>
I&#x27;m relatively fine with the current seat arrangement, and I&#x27;m happy
that airlines aren&#x27;t being mandated to increase prices for everyone
due to some government-imposed seat size regulations.<p>I&#x27;m happy that I have the option to choose airlines like EasyJet for
shorter trips which are essentially glorified cattle carts with wings
on them, but which would allow me to affordably go somewhere over a
weekend. If I want more seat space there&#x27;s always something like KLM&#x27;s
Economy+, or other similar premium arrangements.<p><pre><code>    > If airlines want to save some money, remove recline completely.
</code></pre>
Aside from the fact that you&#x27;re entering into a voluntary business
arrangement with the airline, and it&#x27;s somewhat presumptuous to assume
that you&#x27;re better aware of how they could save money than they are:<p>When you&#x27;re sitting down in a chair your upper body isn&#x27;t taking up
volume in the space going up vertically from your knees, so there&#x27;s
space for the seat in front of you to recline into that space.<p>So this suggestion doesn&#x27;t make sense. It&#x27;s not an either-or, maybe
airlines would benefit from removing or reducing recline, but that&#x27;s
not mutually exclusive with saving money by reducing the space between
seats.",1418669237

Why difficult? Logically, there must be some reason the last guy is leaving.

Startup didnt work out and eventually ceased after ~2 years. Shortly before that I started working short-time freelance jobs over Freelancer/Elance. This worked out very well (as much as it possible over those types of sites) and I opened my own IT consultancy company few months after.<p>Few months ago, since I was fully working remotely, I decided to start traveling. I dropped out from college with one class left, which I&#x27;ve been dragging for few last years, and I&#x27;m currently located in Thailand. I am 25 years old now. I have several clients that I charge 50-100$/hour, however this can change overnight and I can drop to zero income. I have enough money buffered up to support myself for the next few years.<p>Now the main reason why am I seeking for advice from HN crowd - I do my work in Delphi. I&#x27;m currently limited with the tech that has 0.01% market share and I&#x27;ve realized that I would never progress further in a professional sense if I don&#x27;t change this and would get stuck forever with mediocre job opportunities. Also I want to get off the freelancer/elance type of sites. There are dozens of different techs that I can choose to learn and all of them are viable. Most appealing to me is to either get proficient in C++ and eventually in C# and work as a developer, or jump into web sphere (node/angular/whatever) and do some contracting or give it a shot to make some lifestyle business which can generate me some passive income.<p>I am honestly kinda lost and scared by all of this, and probably overthinking a bit, but I&#x27;m not really sure where to head at.

If you are the only one that knows how, the algorithms probably can&#x27;t detect and compensate for the error. As soon as news breaks out, the algorithm starts compensating. We saw this about 10 years ago when there were a few companies that started promoting the ability to search for Y-class fares...it was all but a year or so before the pricing stabilized.

Perhaps it&#x27;s a bad choice, as it is the &quot;default&quot; project, but it&#x27;s the area I am most interested in.  I am not an expert in encrypted file systems, but I am a developer for a private cloud storage provider, and have some passing familiarity with the subject.<p>* Paranoia: Another Encrypted File System<p>They make repeated statements about relying on the server to protect the file from access such as &quot;We depend on the server to correctly process ACLs and serve files that the user is authorized to view.&quot; and &quot;If the server can be trusted to enforce the ACLs,no malicious user, perhaps named Mallory, can be permitted to read Alice&#x27;s files.&quot; but since the premise of these projects is to deny trust to the server it seems odd to trust the server with anything.  They do make sure that file contents cannot be read by the server without the client key, however I&#x27;m not sure why they went ahead and implemented a server except as a learning exercise or perhaps to provide an end-to-end solution.  Inspection of the GitHub code raised some odd practices, such as explicit calls to sys.path.insert(0, &#x27;/home/henchill/Documents/Workspace/encrypted_file_system/server&#x27;), which makes me think perhaps it wasn&#x27;t packaged correctly.  At least they put it on GitHub, some of the other project were shipped as tar.gz.<p>* FyreBox - Encrypted File System<p>&quot;Our filesystem is made up of 3 components: the client, the server, and a trusted cloud service.&quot;  A trusted cloud service for the keys?  I don&#x27;t know why you would trust a cloud service and not the server.  GitHub code seems reasonably clean, but requiring trusted cloud service seems like a dealbreaker.<p>* KBox: An Encrypted File System<p>I see a lot of math and LaTex, and security seems well considered, but I have to wonder about usability.  The solution seems to store so much on the client side, including information needed to reconstruct the root directory and file names, that access from multiple clients or using it for sharing files seems untenable.  However, I could have misunderstood.  Noticed mixed tabs and spaces in the Python code, as well as cleartext password and private key in the code.  Even if it is for testing, seems like bad practice.<p>* DarkFS - An Encrypted File System<p>I think I actually liked this one the best.  They start right out by saying they do not trust the server for anything, and implemented their solution against the Dropbox API.  They insert and encrypt the permissions/ACLs with the file data.  However, these permissions are enforced by the client, so I wonder if a malicious client implementation could sidestep the permissions checking entirely.  It is unclear if the permissions are enforced by the nature and sequence of the encryption itself.  They also mention that had some issues with the Dropbox API, specifically being unable to encode file sharing data.  I wonder if they would have been better served to implement their solution against the Amazon S3 API, as it supports file metadata and is quickly become the standard for file storage.  S3 API is implemented by OpenStack Swift, EMC Atmos, Hitachi HCP, etc.  Their code seemed well organized and the writers seemed familiar with Python.  Would have preferred to see it on GitHub.<p>I was also a bit disappointed not to see anything here about distributed filesystems, leveraging torrents or other distributed infrastructure so that no server has the whole picture.  There was interesting work done in projects such as Tahoe-LAFS years ago, nothing in these MIT projects seems radically innovative.",1418667906

In 2008 I was working for an architecture firm building pre-visualizations for the projects they were either currently building or ones they were bidding on. I&#x27;d dabbled as a web developer as a hobby for a couple years.<p>Then the bottom dropped out of the economy and I was laid off. I took it as a chance to turn this whole web hobby thing into a full-time gig. After two months I landed a job as a web developer at a very small printing company. They needed someone who could blend design and web dev into one role, and it seemed I fit the bill. They had another dev and apart from that had no idea how to build a website. I was grateful I wasn&#x27;t going to have to dig into my savings any more. Three days in I already started dreading going to work in the morning. I didn&#x27;t gel with my manager, we constantly misunderstood each other. I never understood what he was looking for design-wise, so I kept bugging him for clarifications. I got the impression he thought I was a diva. And the dude was a printing industry vet, who just didn&#x27;t understand the web at all. It wasn&#x27;t a good fit.<p>I was rescued that Friday by an offer from a different company I&#x27;d interviewed with. So after a week, I walked into the owner&#x27;s office, told him I had a better offer[0], and that I was leaving now. I walked right out the door. No two-weeks notice.<p>That job is notably absent from my resume. Why would I put it there? The whole point of a resume is to sell yourself to potential employers.

I am much more efficient and happy in C or my old Basic. This is the worst idea ever!&quot; But, I did it. Then there was C++, .Net in various flavors, and Java also in various flavors. Each time I thought this language/framework stinks! It&#x27;s actually a relatively common thing to think from a developers standpoint. In very recent years I have learned Ruby and Rails as well as some Python and Django. Then a few weeks ago a very lucrative and fun contract came up in PHP (of all things)! At this point I feel very comfortable with three ideas in my career that might be useful to you:<p>1) There is no perfect language and all of them can do amazing things with the right person (me! and heck you too!) behind them.<p>2) Sometimes I will be less effective when I am starting in a new or changing environment but half the fun is finding where I can lead and make great changes for the users.<p>3) Offshoring will exacerbate issues these issues but my ability to make substantial impacts increases exponentially with the amount of offshoring that is going on within an organization. I capitalize on this.<p>Obviously, if you are just tired of being there and don&#x27;t want to stay, then leave. Though I would suggest like either that you find a job before you quit your current position. However, if the whole code base needs a good refactoring, by all means, make an impact!

8753343,comment,8751747,8752881,0,0,pyrois,,,"Good point! For me, I think the question here isn&#x27;t so much &quot;performance gains&quot; as &quot;interoperability, near-ubiquity, and staying power&quot;.<p>For &quot;interoperability&quot;, I&#x27;m just going to quote myself:<p>&quot;If you write your library in Perl, guess what, only people writing Perl will use it. If you write it in Java, well, maybe the Scala folk will wrap it up, or the Jython folk, but you won&#x27;t get any people writing in Ruby to use it. If you write it in C++, you can provide efficient bindings to any of those languages.&quot;<p>In terms of ubiquity, what I mean is that almost every platform has a standards-compliant-ish C++ compiler for it. And before people get in a tizzy, I mean weird platforms, not just computers with a browser installed. That&#x27;s Intel, yes, but also DSPs, FPGAs, ARMs, and whole host of other chips. This didn&#x27;t used to be true, but with LLVM, almost an entire standards-compliant C++ toolchain can be generated for your platform pretty easily. The exception tends to be, ironically enough, exceptions. They need to be special-cased for your chip, but still, C++ exists in places where the JVM doesn&#x27;t dare go.<p>And finally, for staying power, I&#x27;ll quote myself again!<p>&quot;Look at FFmpeg or ImageMagick. They are libraries that just _won&#x27;t die_, no matter how hard people have tried. My god, ImageMagick was written in 1987, and it now has Haskell bindings[0]! The only way to get that sort of longevity (and old code is good code, after all [1]) is to write in language that will outlast the ups and downs of the language or framework du jour, and C and C++ have proven to have that staying power.&quot;<p>[0] <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/imagemagick"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/imagemagick</a>

If the government makes mistakes or does something poorly, the press will challenge them on it with the expectation that things will improve.<p>In the US, we are almost self-defeatingly cynical about the idea of good government. &quot;That government is best which governs least&quot; is a distinctly American motto. But I think we actually can expect more from our government, we just don&#x27;t because we don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible. And so ironically we are stuck with a government that governs quite a lot, actually, and not that well.<p>Already in the US, standard search and arrest warrants are unnecessarily performed by heavily armed SWAT teams. Depending on where you live, you better not have any pets if the police come for you because they will kill them. If we disarmed ordinary patrol cops in the US, they would just not do anything and send SWAT to do all the real work.",1418666630

Naturally, neural activity during behaviors is strongly correlated with features of the behaviors themselves, so it&#x27;s quite possible that this is just another way of operationalizing/coding the behavior-based diagnosis approach. That could have advantages (maybe it&#x27;s more repeatable, for example), but they don&#x27;t appear to be claiming that they&#x27;re doing something radically different, like identifying causal neural features.",1418666426

We received our diagnosis at 2yrs,8mo. Our son was frankly autistic by any definition. We dove in hard, and for many years had close to 40hrs of various therapies per week. (OT, PT, Speech/Language, Behavior, Social, etc.) He had an IEP, and we advocated, because you have to.<p>He&#x27;s 11 now, is in a neurotypical classroom with no formal support and thriving.

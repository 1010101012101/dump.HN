You're usually dealing with pretty meaty technical and organizational problems, which can be fun. And in the right circumstances, the customers will fund or subsidize your development efforts, which can make your investment go farther.<p>The tradeoff is it's less sexy.  Sales cycles are long.  The tools you build need to be robust.",1359226753
5121307,comment,5120922,5120922,7,0,brandonb,,,"Although I agree with a lot of the advice in the article, there's a ""new school"" of enterprise too, and ideas like virality from the consumer world often apply to the new enterprise.<p>""Old school"" enterprise sales meant hiring an army of field salespeople. It meant on-site visits, and pitching directly to the CIO, CFO, CMO, hiring sales engineers to build pilots, negotiate with procurement for months, etc. And all that meant the cost of a sale was high -- often $50,000+ -- which meant that your contracts had better be in the six-figures if you want to be profitable.<p>That's now how most B2B companies work in 2013. Look at Stripe, Yammer, Parse, Github, or Twilio -- you can sign up directly on their web site, often get started for free or cheap enough that you don't trigger purchase approval. Most of the customers for those companies come in through inbound channels, like blog posts, ads, partnerships, or referrals. And to the extent that they have sales, it's inside sales, primarily working to convert existing, happy users of the product to paying customers.<p>Chris Dixon has a great related blog post on this:

In part due to some of the things you talk about.<p>While the Gates Foundation did waste time and money on the small schools initiative, but in some ways I view it as a model for how social research should work.<p>They had a theory and some supporting data.  They tried to implement a program to optimize it and measured the results.  And while they may have been ruthless in driving this, they were equally ruthless with their measurement.  They didn't hide their results.

5121299,comment,5120020,5120598,2,0,zxcdw,,,"30 years ago you could actually ""understand"" the whole computer. While 64 KiB is quite a bit of RAM for human to keep track of, it was still possible to quite easily remember how the address space was laid out and what exact addresses were used for storing individual pieces of variables used by the OS/environment and what addresses to PEEK/POKE to interface with the OS services. People really knew how the machine operated at hardware and software level. Inside out.<p>20 years ago it was much harder to understand the whole machine or it's operating system. While there was direct access to low-level services(BIOS/DOS interrupts on PCs), some APIs started emerging, including OpenGL and soon DirectX to make things more complex. People had hard time understanding the exact inners of the hardware and especially software, although specialized understanding was still very relevant for many.<p>10 years ago it had became quite useless to try to deal with hardware directly. Compilers started being so good that hand-written assembly started having bad benefit/cost ratio. People stopped caring about optimizig code or really understanding about the hardware details. Software became already quite complex to truly understand, focus shifted from understanding the environment to understand the tools and some libraries.<p>Today understanding the hardware is essentially impossible. You can't really deduce what exactly the CPU is doing when you read the instructions, many programmers don't even know what an instruction or a register is, let alone understand branch predictors or memory caches. Lots of code run on <i>virtual machines</i> rather than directly on real machines. Operating systems have virtual layers here and there and programming culture(at least to some extent, my own observation) has opted some perverse idea that <i>you should not optimize</i> or even consider optimizing code, because ""PREMATURE OPTIMIZATION IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL!!"". Programming work requires very little understanding of the system or platform, and many skills are very short-living and focus on specific technologies/libraries. Most programming problems are researched from the Internet via StackOverflow. There's very little room for truly understanding the environment, things change so fast and are so complex that it's just not important.<p>Things get more and more complex at exponential rate. I find this quite sad because I for one love low-level tinkering with stable interfaces and problems/domains which require extensive studying and investigating to come up with creative solutions to uncommon problems, rather than running into problem X and asking on Stackoverflow about what pattern to use or what library call to make to get around the issue.",1359226552

There is still 15 months of support left.<p>Perhaps the most important thing about a browser is the other stuff it drags with it - for example you are likely to use the identity services (eg using Chrome makes having a Google account more conducive) plus other things (storage, photos, email etc).  It is in Microsoft's interest to bring people into that.<p>> Just entices people to upgrade to Windows 7/8, and actually be secure.<p>You can't practically upgrade from XP.

I am simply pointing out that if you want to use the engineering method to effect change on a global scale - and I think that is absolutely the right approach - then you first need to make sure that it is <i>good</i> engineering. Gates, who by all accounts is an excellent engineer, is (if the quote is genuine) aware of the problems with software metrics.

Birth rate is extremely well-correlated with infant mortality rate, and pretty well anticorrelated with both life expectancy and quality of life.

I suspect many of the hackers on this site of used TI-BASIC, and possibly Z80 ASM.<p>This was all of the experience in coding I had for the next 4 years. I became extremely good at TI-BASIC and ASM. But in High School I started fooling around with Python and the world of Object Oriented programming bewildered me.<p>In TI-BASIC you get 27 float variables, 6 lists of floats, all limited to 999 elements, 10 strings, and 6 matrices of floats. That is all the data one gets. Very quickly one becomes a wizard of string manipulations (because strings were the only datatype without a default memory cap; they could be as long as your RAM could hold) and whatnot.<p>Whenever I moved to Python, I found myself following the same paradigm. I didn't make a single Python class until I was in college. I would use tuples and lists and just organize my data that way.<p>After my collegiate conversion to OOP (and subsequently writing heavily OO Python), I later found out that it is somewhat encouraged to use the built in datatypes over custom classes for performance reasons.<p>I was accidentally acting Roman without realizing it!",1359226112

The first one is that population growth is naturally unbounded, but that idea has been outdated for a long time. Population growth follows a logistic growth curve.<p>Another bad assumption you're making is that the West's population is growing rapidly, but it's not. In fact, populations in Western countries are barely growing, and often are only growing due to immigration, or due to higher birth rates among immigrant populations.<p>Finally, yet another bad assumption you're making is that we should limit population growth through draconian measures like well murdering people, or allowing them to die unnecessarily. In fact, the best way to limit population growth is through education, better access to healthcare, and economic development. As people become more educated and financially successful, they naturally delay childbirth and have fewer children as a result. When people have access to health services like education, birth control and abortions, they can better make decisions about children.<p>You can google overpopulation myth or simply overpopulation to verify what I've written here.",1359226107

Typically the people asking for a ""dashboard"" are executives who really shouldn't care, who only need regular briefings plus an occasional text from someone in operations warning them of a major customer impact.  The people who benefit from them are engineers who browse around the system looking for trouble or simply satisfying their curiosity.  ""The Foo servers handle the Bar requests.  I wonder what their typical CPU utilization is.  I'll go check one of them... <i>click click click</i>.  Whoa, that memory usage doesn't look good.  I wonder if it's always like that.  <i>click</i>  WTF is this erratic sawtooth pattern?  Do the other Foo servers have this, too?  <i>click click click</i>  Yeesh, somebody needs to fix that.""  That's the ideal case, anyway, if you have a rich UI that is good at presenting pages of data in context that can be understood at a glance, with quick navigation to related data.  If the engineer clicks the ""CPU utilization"" button and gets back a line graph and a table of numbers, with no other context, then the UI is forcing the engineer to have tunnel vision.  It should be dashboards all the way down, until the engineer starts running custom queries that the system doesn't know how to provide context for.<p>But yeah, the chronic restarting scenario should show up in reports and hopefully trigger an alert.

However that has little direct correlation with how the divorce goes.<p>You point out that women tend to get over 50% of the assets.  This is true.  However women tend to keep the kids, and therefore take an undue portion of the future economic liabilities coming from the relationship.  In particular this makes it more likely that they will be granted the house - typically the couple's biggest asset.  Furthermore if you include expected future income, women are suddenly much worse off.<p>And we come to the more important point.  It is indisputable that women are much more likely to be granted custody of the kids.  However most of the time men don't actually <i>want</i> custody of the kids.  When men choose to contest it, they usually wind up with the kids.  (For the simple reason that, having a more dependable source of income, men are typically in a better position to raise the kids.)  you have to look at what the couple wanted.  Men who choose to contest custody usually wind up with the kids.  Therefore the fact that the woman tends to wind up with the bulk of the responsibility for that liability isn't actually a sign that women are coming out ahead in the divorce.",1278309578

They'll give you plenty of energy and ability to focus. This explains why they are rather commonly used by students and other folks.<p>The life changing aspect, for me, is that they can sometimes break me out a depressive episode. I'll have days sitting around, desperately wanting to work on something, but ending up watching TV, eating, and sleeping. This of course makes me feel bad about having not done anything, which just worsens the situation.<p>Stimulants can change that. Apart from the energy and focus, they often propel me into doing something. I've taken them, feeling pessimistic and resigning myself to another day of sitting around. But they'll kick in, I'll pull up my laptop, and code 8+ hours straight. That bit of progress alone is enough sometimes to break out of the depressive streak and get on with things.<p>But please, before starting any medications, make sure you have a psychologist to monitor you. Do not underestimate suicidal thoughts. The closest I've been to suicide is when I tried out an anti-depressive. Medication that can pull you out of depression can also provide you the energy and willpower to follow through with suicide.",1278309488

He's a boy and he's in very good health, but he was born at 30 weeks (now he's at 32). Her water broke at 27 weeks.<p>We were on the cutting-edge with this pregnancy ever since the start ... she had 2 embryonic bags (most likely twins) and lost one, causing her an ugly hemorrhage and a detachment of the other bag. This detachment was nullified by the child growing, and her water breaking was totally unrelated to that (urinary infection).<p>After the water broke, the child stayed in her for another 3 weeks, because at 27 weeks children are not viable. This was a dangerous and highly unlikely outcome ... when water breaks most women go into labor immediately. And if not ... it is dangerous because the amniotic fluid was mostly gone and both mother and child could have suffered (even death) from a uterus infection.<p>And I could say that this was just our luck or that we had some kind of a divine intervention ... I prefer the later, and I would probably go mad if it was the former.<p>I also noticed another thing ...  I have several friends that are now doctors, and I also made lots of friends in the hospital since my wife was hospitalized. People working in health-care have an easier time believing in God than in any other profession I know.  Probably because they  witness highly unlikely events a lot (miracles do happen).",1278307513

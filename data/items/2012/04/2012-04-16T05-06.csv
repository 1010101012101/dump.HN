3846087,comment,3844302,3846007,9,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"As the founding member of the npm crew, I'd like to provide some history.<p>I started using this style originally because I -- not new to JavaScript, and adhering to the ""semicolons everywhere"" style -- was bitten twice in rapid succession; first by a leading [ causing a function to receive ""undefined"" as an argument (instead of two arrays), and then again by a leading ( resulting in a non-function being called.  Both were unnecessarily difficult to debug, because my brain couldn't see the error.  (Even when JSLint complained, I thought it was lying.  ,] looks a lot like ], at first glance, and is valid JS.  Maybe I'm a little dyslexic or something.)<p>So, I thought, ""New rule: Commas first, prefix ( and [ with semicolons.""  Problem solved.<p>But ending a line with a semicolon seemed kind of silly when I was then prefixing with a semicolon the next line, even though I'd learned that it was absolutely necessary for any kind of ""safety"" (even as an expert, even as a semicolon user).  So, I thought, if I'm doing this silly prefixing thing to make ASI safe, why not just let it be safe, and drop them everywhere?<p>So I did.  And it's pretty nice.<p>I don't understand why people get so upset about how I write programs, especially those that they don't even use or contribute to.  The first time a professional JavaScripter cursed me out at the top of his lungs in a bar, literally spitting in my face while he screamed at me, I realized that there was some essential human weirdness involved here, and it became much too interesting to drop.  Every time I ask people to please not lie about JavaScript to newcomers, they accuse me of being dogmatic or a semicolon hater.<p>But I maintain the JavaScript in Node.js as well, which follows Google's (occasionally insane) C++-inspired semicolon-ridden JavaScript style, and I'm fine with that.  It's kind of nice, too, in a different way.  More dots.  Vim's auto-indenter works a little better.<p>What's wrong with just not lying?  I don't get it at all.  People who already know C and Java are usually veteran enough to grok weird language warts.  People from Python and Ruby have an easier time learning the exceptions than sticking to the rule, since their habits are usually to omit the ceremonial EOL punctuation.  And newcomers don't have any preconceptions anyway; they're busy learning why we call ""this"" a string, and why this is always something different, and crazy shit like ""a function is an object and you construct an instance of it with new which calls it on a this that inherits from its prototype"".  (I mean, seriously, read that sentence to a nonprogrammer, and ask them what it means.  It's gibberish!)<p>But people react to it like I've insulted them personally, when I just ask that they not fill newcomers' heads with lies and fud.  I still don't understand it.",1334555169

3846069,comment,3842713,3845532,4,0,leif,,,"Ending every line with // is noise because it means nothing to the compiler or to the human.  If I could write comments without prefixing them with //, I would (but the compiler won't let me).  () and ; are not noise because they simplify the rules of the language.  They make it so someone reading your code needs to remember fewer esoteric rules to understand it.  That is a big win.  Saving a single character of typing per line, for your fingers and your disk, is a miniscule win.  I hope you're writing code that's more interesting than a typing contest (but if you aren't, maybe you care about the semicolons).  The disk and the network don't care about one more semicolon per expression.  They know about compression, they will deal with it.  If your compiler doesn't complain when you miss them, you need a better compiler.  Maybe a linter, or google's closure.  Or maybe there's a market for a decent javascript compiler.  I don't understand what you mean by ""when semi-colons fade into the background, it is MUCH harder to catch the one case where they are important"".  If you use them everywhere and you miss one, it's easy to spot.  If you have to examine each line with a set of rules in order to figure out if you actually needed one there, that's a more expensive task.<p>Ruby, python, and coffeescript were designed with significant newlines, and therefore designed around the corner cases.  The only reason you'll need semicolons in those languages is to have two statements on the same line (coffeescript excepted, I'm not sure about it but my guess is that they did it right).  These languages went to great lengths to reduce the cases where you need statement separators, and document this behavior widely and clearly.  Perl requires semicolons, dunno where you got the idea it didn't.  I don't know about smalltalk and go, I don't use them.<p>I probably did miss what you were trying to say.<p>In languages that weren't designed with significant newlines, everybody uses the statement separator at the end of a line, so it seems to me that moving them to the beginning of lines is just confusing.  In any case, ASI is <i>not</i> significant newlines, it's a hack.  I don't know what more to do than to just beat it into your head.  It is not a feature you should rely on.<p>The important part of what I'm trying to express is that, in <i>any</i> language, the most important thing you need to do is to write explicit code.  This means typing all the characters so that not only does the compiler (and tools) not get confused, but future human readers don't get confused either.  Javascript intends for you to separate your statements with semicolons.  If you start playing tricks with them, you are going to confuse people that try to understand (or, heavens, learn from) your code.  You will get burned.<p>Consider this example (I'm a C guy):<p><pre><code>    if (a && b || c && d | e || f && g)
</code></pre>
How does this resolve?  Does it help you if I write this?<p><pre><code>    if ((a && b) || (c && (d | e)) || (f && g))
</code></pre>
It sure as hell does.  Now, these are semantically identical.  But when you read the second one, you don't need to know that bitwise OR binds tighter than logical AND, and logical AND binds tighter than logical OR.  These are details you <i>should not need to remember</i> when you read my code.  Are parentheses just line noise here?  I think not.  I think they are quite meaningful.  Not to the compiler, but to the human consumers of my code.  It's costs the reader a lot more to read the first one than the second.  The first one is mentally <i>expensive</i>.  (In fact, modern C compilers will warn you about not having these parens here because they know that adding them is a good idea.  If you turn on warnings.)<p>The same applies for ASI.  If you rely on extra compiler tricks a human needs to remember, that's expensive.  It is a lot better to have a simpler rule: just put a semicolon after every statement, and don't make anyone think about it again.  Or put one before, I don't really care.  Just do something <i>consistent</i>.  Try to code to a simpler subset of the language, to make other programmers' lives easier.<p>I really don't mean this to be an attack against you or the javascript community.  Well, I sort of do, because abusing ASI is stupid, but I actually mean this to be an educational experience.  Let me help you mature as a programmer.",1334554776

It's not shrinking by any means, just examining the census numbers shows it outpacing Boston in growth 4.9% to 4.8% between 2000 and 2010.<p>Worcester is at a cross-roads now. It has excellent proximity to Boston and Providence. It has a strong bio-medical industry as well as three highly regarded universities (Holy Cross, WPI, and Clark) as well as several smaller, less known ones. Several major hospitals too. If Massachusetts can sort out the commuter rail situation and cut travel time down to <45min between Worcester and Boston then it could really take off as an alternative to Boston for people with families and on budgets.<p>It does have its issues. Certain neighborhoods are giant crime-pits (Main South, Vernon Hill etc.) On the other hand it has an extremely safe, pleasant west-side with some pockets of high-affluence. East and North Worcester range from OK to good. It's a very spread out city despite having 180K people living in it which unfortunately means cars are a must.<p>It's all going to be about transportation. Commuter rail to Boston will improve, part of the deal to allow CSX to expand its freight yard in Worcester was to add 10 - 20 more trains to Worcester between now and 2020. The Pike bypasses Worcester but since the completion of the 146 connector that has stopped being a real issue. If those things occur, and it is a big-if, expect the urban-downtown area of Worcester to boom as it's a small downtown area and it will be important to tightly pack around the train station because of the lack of transportation around the rest of the city.",1334554103

I don't imagine people who watch the History Channel would have a comparable understanding to those who read about similar topics through Wikipedia. Video is often just a distraction.",1334552832

The original founders pitched it to some investors who liked it, but had doubts about the team, so what they do? they give everything (biz plan, doc, mockups, etc) to their EiRs and they launch an exact copy of it, sans the domain name for obvious reasons.<p>For me it was just another story, until I talked to one of the investors at that fund and instead of flat out denying it he said ""how do you know that?""<p>Consider that whatever verbal contract you got with investors or other entrepreneurs is not legally valid, so if they actually copy your ideas you are SOL.",1334552747

First-to-market advantage, coupled with an innovative, actually useful idea and polished execution is a sure way to build large user following quickly, which is typically one of early-stage startup's top priorities. Large money making comes afterwards and it requires an established business, which is a different context where first to the market advantage is of a lesser importance.",1334552657

For example, if you are going to try building an app in Ruby, then there will be a bunch of things you will use to build that app.  Most of those things will probably be on Github.  Those are the projects to watch and perhaps contribute to.<p>Establish yourself as an authority, or at least create some visibility for yourself.  Again, you do this by writing code, publishing code, writing articles, meeting people, etc.  Another way to do this would be to make a name for yourself in less mature but trending areas.  For example, NodeJS is very new and there are a lot of problems which still need to be solved in that ecosystem.  Pick a problem, run with it and then if you can nail it then you have just established some authority for yourself.  Keep building up this profile and you will have no problems landing work.",1334552452

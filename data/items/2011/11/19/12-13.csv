A simple printf(""hello world\n""); Adds about 200 bytes bringing it up to 22,637.  That adds all the functionality of printf, variadic arguments, everything prinf does that your version doesn't.  There is a basic C runtime that goes with all C programs.  Every programming language besides assembly does something similar.  You could always run strip on the executable that knocks the printf version down to 8,192 bytes.",1321707435

Whatever you have, someone else would kill to have it themselves.<p>The only way to step outside of the cycle is to start comparing yourself to yourself. Whatever it is that you do, be better at it. Be the best at it. Don&#x27;t focus on improving, focus on straight up dominating. It&#x27;s counter intuitive, but the best way to get to the next level is to acknowledge that you aren&#x27;t very good right now. It&#x27;s difficult, most successful people refuse to admit any kind of fault or regret. That&#x27;s fine for the merely successful. But you should be trying to become <i>godlike</i>. When you aspire to that level, how much money other people raise or how often they appear in the press won&#x27;t matter to you any more than the business of ants on the ground. If you want to transcend envy[0], you must transcend yourself and your current level of ambition.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter what anyone else is doing, or what people think of them. It doesn&#x27;t matter what anyone thinks of you. Show the world something wonderful and amazing, do things that people didn&#x27;t think were possible. Solve a real problem for millions of people, or just impress yourself with how cool what you&#x27;ve made is. Do whatever is necessary to make your name shine, whatever the cost. Everything else will take care of itself.<p>[0] pedantry: &quot;envy&quot; is the desire for what others have, &quot;jealousy&quot; is the fear that someone else will take what you have.",1420059428

We have, on occassion, done some of the same kind of things as NK, but not typically to the same extent, with the same level of brutality and control, let alone all at the same time, today.<p>When, for example, have we done this?<p>> The government practices collective punishment, sending to forced labor camps not only the offender but also their parents, spouse, children, and even grandchildren. These camps are notorious for horrific living conditions and abuse, including induced starvation, little or no medical care, lack of proper housing and clothes, continuous mistreatment and torture by guards, and executions. Forced labor at the kwan-li-so often involves difficult physical labor such as mining, logging, and agricultural work, all done with rudimentary tools in often dangerous and harsh conditions. Death rates in these camps are reportedly extremely high.<p>Or this?<p>> All media and publications are state controlled, and unauthorized access to non-state radio or TV broadcasts is punished.  North Koreans are punished if found with mobile media such as DVDs or computer ‘flash drives’ containing unauthorized TV programs, such as South Korean drama and entertainment shows.<p>Or this?<p>> North Korea criminalizes leaving the country without state permission.<p>Or this?<p>> people arrested in North Korea are routinely tortured by officials seeking confessions, bribes, and obedience. Common forms of torture include sleep deprivation, beatings with iron rods or sticks, kicking and slapping, and enforced sitting or standing for hours.

If it is, then your success is easy to measure: number of people helped. If you haven&#x27;t helped enough people to feel satisfied, then your course of action is <i>also</i> clear: help more people.<p><i>raised a bunch of money... is all over the press... in some cases has achieved real success</i><p>The root of all unhappiness is believing something that isn&#x27;t true. What&#x27;s more likely, that you&#x27;ve dedicated your life to helping people, or that your motivation is money and recognition? One litmus test is to ask whether you&#x27;d be happy making a fortune (complete with a big house, million dollar income, maybe a writeup in Forbes) writing software for, oh, I don&#x27;t know, a paycheck cashing firm.<p>The fact is that you are selfish, greedy, egotistical. I don&#x27;t say this to be mean, but to be honest - it&#x27;s true for 99.9% of humans. Each of us wants to be special, to be the winner of our peer group; we all want to be envied (which is precisely how people shape their image on social media).<p>One possible reconciliation is to firmly assert that people spend money on things that they think will benefit them. Money is the primordial &quot;like&quot; button. This implies that if you have a lot of money either: 1) you&#x27;ve provided real value to lots of people, or 2) someone with lots of money believes you can provide lots of value to people (e.g. a raise). (This doesn&#x27;t always seem to be the case; in fact, much of the wealthy people in the world don&#x27;t <i>appear</i> to be doing much for it, although software firms are a clear exception there.)<p>Bon chance.",1420059116

This robotic snake problem is solving a problem that does not exist.<p>And, please, don&#x27;t invoke the handicapped card as someone already did.  They manage just fine today.  Anyone, handicapped or not, who qualifies to drive a car can handle plugging a cord into a socket.  A 7 year old kid can do it.<p>So why throw a $30,000+ robot at a non-existing problem.  I&#x27;ll tell you why:<p>Musk understands marketing.  With oil prices so low and nothing significant coming out of Tesla they all but evaporated from public view.  There is/was no news to be had about Tesla.  The SUV is tanking.  That&#x27;s a non-story.  So, how do we get people talking about Tesla again.  We put out outrageous-yet-brilliant-sounding futuristic ideas that are easy to consume by the average Joe and blog writers can parrot liberally.  Musk/Tesla sound like geniuses and the general public doesn&#x27;t even take a millisecond to apply critical thinking to what they just read.<p>The ONLY way a complex robotic auto-charge system might have a tenuous level of applicability is in the context of self driving cars AND &quot;driven&quot; by people so extremely handicapped that they would not be allowed to drive a car today.  In other words, paraplegic, severe Parkinsons or other ailments.<p>That scenario is decades away.  And, even then, a simple drive-on docking station would be far cheaper, reliable and easier to install than some kind of a robotic snake rig.<p>I love technology as much as anyone on HN and i have been involved in industrial and educational robotics my entire adult life.  Yet, I have to be honest with myself and not treat everything like a nail just because I have a hammer.<p>So Tesla will sell you a $30,000 robotic snake for your $80,000 car while Toyota will probably sell you a $3,000 floor-mounted docking station for their $30,000 car.

For instance, a couple of months back a mother killed herself and her three children by driving 100 km/h head-on at a bus where his husband was travelling. This was just an act of defiance, desperation  and hate.<p>When suicides count for about one fifth of traffic deaths, it is not insignificant and leaves the number of traffic deaths well above zero. Also, natural deaths - people dying of a heart attack or a stroke while driving - account for a significant part of the statistics (somewhere around 10-15 %).

8820989,comment,8820511,8820511,0,0,funkyy,,,"I will tell you quick story when I had same problem as you.<p>I was once extremely successfully person in my field of expertise. It was specific niche, small market (global, but still small considering there was estimated 10K possible leads in it). At the peak I would manage a bit short of 100 people working for me as contractors and I have tapped around 6-7% of global market (per estimates top providers of service shared with itself). Everything was going extremely well, I was doing amazing financially. But the issues began rising within me. I felt I wasn&#x27;t ready for this. I hit the ceiling. I couldn&#x27;t scale anymore. I was blind and my decisions in other fields were extremely poor (it took some balls to acknowledge this - since I didnt liked to critique my business methods).<p>It was strange - depression like feeling. I didn&#x27;t expect to get it AFTER I got so successful.\nLiving the dream (I moved to remote location in tropical paradise) I would sit all day at home with shutters closed.\nI couldn&#x27;t go forward. I didnt expected that I couldn&#x27;t grow any more. My market was limited and my ambition was hurt. The success came too easy to me and I wasn&#x27;t ready for it.<p>Upon a lot of thinking and stressing I would finally close my company within a week, let go all contractors after giving them away all my leads to them so they could offer the service directly to customers, and would move to different country while &quot;burning all the bridges&quot;. With enough money to sustain myself for 6 months I would do something completely stupid just to prove myself I wasnt that good, that I was doing it all wrong - I have created company in a market I didnt know anything about, market that was over-saturated and hostile.<p>After few months of barely having any revenue I run out of my money and was left with scraps. Got in to deep depression, being mad at myself that I hurted one person I cared about - my partner, as I have dragged her with me in to this (but with her agreeing this was best for us, so at least it was our choice, not just mine).<p>Got back to my home town, moved back to my parents house and started rethinking everything from basics - why I am who I am. I understood how many lies are in entrepreneurship world and how &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; is the most important lesson. Good taste is everything in online biz world, and as with failed startups people wont tell you you are wrong, they wont tell you the true way of doing business. They will say &quot;Great Idea! I love it! I would use it anytime! Now join me in Twitter, like XXX pages and pay back b*tch for me being nice to you!&quot; Circle of narcissistic, spoiled kids.<p>After 6 months I was ready, I opened new business with €100 investment for domain and hosting I had left after spending rest for food (I refused anyone to help me financially) and quickly started making revenue and getting back on track. I removed all limits, I do not limit myself any more. I do not think of &quot;making $XX.XXX profit target&quot; which is counter-productive. Who cares whats the profit? Is it better to have $100K company and make $60K profit, or have $100Mil company and make $3K profit a month?<p>You cannot succeed - go above your targets because you are limiting yourself. People will tell you some BS like &quot;its not you&quot; - dont listen to this. Every single problem you might have right now will have root inside you and way you are doing this. You will need to learn how to remove those limits now by failing, or by really going back in your life and trying to understand yourself and judging/reviewing every single action that lead you to position you are in. Perfectly both though.<p>Once you remove those limits you will be free and happy again and everything will come 2 times easier to you.<p>Good Luck!",1420058562

8820983,comment,8819549,8820537,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"There&#x27;s a more tragic example in the news today, which I was just discussing with my wife. A woman was shopping in a Walmart with her 2 year old son, and had a loaded handgun in her purse. She had a concealed carry permit and the gun was inside some sort of gun-safety purse which she had received for Christmas, which I presume is designed to prevent fingers accidentally catching in triggers and so on. Unfortunately her toddler reached into the purse, managed somehow to discharge the gun, and it killed the mom.<p>So we were wondering what do you tell the kid, and how, in a case like that when he gets older, because the psychological burden of having killed your own parent is pretty crushing. I was speculating that a few decades back, everyone might have agreed to bury the exact details and just write it up as an accidental discharge caused by the woman herself that would be just as tragic but not as disturbing for the kid, whereas today that simply isn&#x27;t possible - at some point in the future the kid will consult a search engine to find out where his birth mother went (or to see what search engines say about him) and come across the facts of the situation, at which point he&#x27;ll presumably have some sort of psychological crisis if he wasn&#x27;t fully aware of them.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the &#x27;right&#x27; course is here. On the one hand we tend to assume that having more information is better than being deceived, but on the other Plato may have been right to suggest that society functions better thanks to the existence of a &#x27;noble lie&#x27; - if we&#x27;re constantly beset with evidence about how awful people are then it&#x27;s hard to avoid falling into cynicism - arguably this is one of the big problems facing Western democracy at the moment. We know the danger in idealizing leaders and institutions and overlooking their actual shortcomings - that is, their capacity for <i>acts</i> which result in socially undesirable outcomes as opposed to some inherent flaw. By facing this, we can identify the circumstances which incentivize such acts and see that they might be emergent from systematic structures within which we operate, rather than being coordinated or planned by a malign central agency or guided by any overarching philosophy. On the other hand, we want out political representatives and institutions to operate effectively on our behalf, and if they keep collectively letting us down then there&#x27;s a decline in our socioeconomic stability and ultimately our personal safety. We need to believe in the possibility of a higher ideal if we are not going to give up hope for the present. The tension between our rational apprehension of the a flawed social model and our idealistic wish for one within which we would enjoy a reasonable balance of freedom and security is both a strength and a weakness of our current social structures. If we have reached or breached the operational limitations of our democratic/republican (small d/r) models of governance, then what comes next? Proposals for widespread individual digital sovereignty do not sound so different from Hobbes&#x27; notion of &#x27;the war of all against all.&#x27; I worry that we&#x27;re headed into an era of craptastic social institutions that don&#x27;t work well at all, and turbo-charged economic ones that work very well above a certain threshold but which involve an ever-increasing computational security burden to stave off incidental attacks.<p>/handwave",1420058425

There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship—be it JC or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles—is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It&#x27;s the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you. On one level, we all know this stuff already. It&#x27;s been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness.<p>Worship power — you will feel weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to keep the fear at bay. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart — you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. And so on.”<p>This is not an attempt to convert you to religion.

8820966,comment,8820511,8820511,0,0,jonnathanson,,,"I was a successful kid. I was the valedictorian of my high school class. I had my pick of the best colleges in the country. If you&#x27;d have asked anyone to guess who&#x27;d grow up to be the most successful person in my circle, most people would have guessed me. I was &quot;successful&quot; at that age because I was smart, but more important, because I literally did nothing but study, study, work, and study some more. This was a fantastic strategy for succeeding in a highly structured, grade-based environment. Unfortunately, the world is not as highly structured. The world doesn&#x27;t give you letter grades. In school, there is a direct correlation between effort and reward. In life, the correlation is certainly there, but it&#x27;s indirect and messy. Luck also plays a big role.<p>Flash forward to today. While I am modestly successful, I am far from the most successful person I grew up with. Two of my elementary-school friends are huge movie stars (one of them has been Oscar-nominated, and will probably win at some point). One of my high-school friends is a phenomenally successful musician, who also stars on a highly rated TV show. One of my early colleagues, from when I was fresh out of college, is now the #2 production executive at the world&#x27;s most successful movie studio; his name is listed in the credits, as Executive Producer, of almost every $1B+ movie released in the last six or seven years. Many of my friends are TV writers, and some of them earn millions of dollars a year. (In case it&#x27;s not clear at this point, I grew up in LA!). At least one of my friends is a tech entrepreneur worth close to half a billion dollars. An ex-girlfriend (ouch!) was an early Google employee.<p>These people make me jealous as fuck. I&#x27;m not going to lie about it, and I&#x27;m not going to sugarcoat it. If you&#x27;re the competitive type, you&#x27;ll <i>always</i> feel a pang of envy over the success of your peers. Doubly so when your peers are successful beyond their wildest dreams (or yours).<p>The first thing I&#x27;d recommend is accepting the jealousy, and recognizing it for what it is. If you&#x27;re a smart and introspective person, you won&#x27;t be able to bullshit yourself -- to will the jealousy away through new-agey mantras and mind tricks. Instead, try to mine the envy for productive lessons. What about these people made them as successful as they are? Are there any operative takeaways for <i>you</i>?<p>Second, and much more important, is learning to be genuinely happy for the success of others. <i>Especially</i> the success of your dear friends. First, because it&#x27;s awesome when good things happen to people you like. Second, because even from a highly cynical standpoint, wouldn&#x27;t you rather be <i>friends</i> with all these fabulously successful people? I don&#x27;t know about you, but it does me absolutely no good when my friends are struggling. Schadenfreude is a terrible investment strategy. Its ROI sucks.<p>I&#x27;d also recommend some light reading on the concept of &quot;EQ&quot; and management of emotions. Emotional self-regulation doesn&#x27;t always come naturally to me. I had to study and practice. Like everything else in life. Most of the literature will tell you that there&#x27;s no use in hiding from, avoiding, or pretending your emotions don&#x27;t exist. Acknowledge them, be mindful of them, and actively attempt to short-circuit them, to channel them in more productive directions, or to move to their adjacent (and often more beneficial) emotional correlates. Jealousy, for instance, seems somewhat adjacent to ambition on the emotional color wheel. When you find yourself feeling jealous, don&#x27;t try to make the leap from jealous to happy. It doesn&#x27;t work that way. Instead, move from jealous to driven.<p>Finally, some of the best advice I&#x27;ve received on the topic of envy comes from pop culture: &quot;Do you.&quot; You can&#x27;t control whether your best friend wins the lottery, or your second cousin sells his startup to Facebook. You <i>can</i> control what you want to do, and how you&#x27;re doing it.",1420058193

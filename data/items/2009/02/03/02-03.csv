The wonderful advantage of CSS is that I can create a multi-column layout where the html might put the content div first and the nav last, if I have a reason to do so. My underlying html structure doesn't need to be in any particular order in order to achieve the layout that I want.\nHe completely misses the fact that CSS2.1 has had display: options to do table-like alignment for years. These are well supported in modern browsers, except for IE6 and 7.<p>I completely recognize this is an argument of ""what should be"" versus ""what is"". As it stands though, I have been doing this for years and have never, never EVER needed to use tables for layout purposes. I get that some people are more interested in writing applications and just don't have to time to learn all of the idiosyncrasies that go into dealing with cross-browser display problems. However most of these are easily overcome, most without even needing CSS hacks.",1233626484

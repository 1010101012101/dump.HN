It's clunky in places, everybody has to roll their own gui toolkit to make anything that looks halfway decent, performance isn't that great (maybe the devices are slow), crap is buried in long lists of settings, I can use a microSD card with it but it's pointless because I can't install anything to that card, restarting the device is a pain since I have to approve a dozen security policy dialogs that don't fit on the screen, typography is a disaster. I once accidentally his the wrong security setting when installing Opera on mine and I have no idea how to change it, after a year of poking around and a full system wipe. So now, every time I go to surf the web, I have to spend 5 minutes fighting past security authorizations.<p>All this was okay in 2000, but the devices haven't evolved one bit since then.

For example, I refused to accept full time employment at my present company before the legal department struck several clauses from their non-compete, and added a specific clause saying that all iPhone software I develop on my own is my personal property, so long as I don't compete directly against them.<p>Most employers have overly broad clauses like ""everything you write is our property,"" and I let them know right up front I would never hire on with a clause like that.  It definitely took some negotiation, and I had an advantage in that I had been a contractor for 1 year previously, and they really wanted me full time.<p>Eventually, they got what they wanted, a full time employee, and I got what I wanted, full time employment with the ability to develop my own iPhone software on the side and retain ownership of my software, as long as it doesn't directly compete with them.<p>This was back in 2007.

Alas, I don't know if it is because I know too little or too much of it</i><p>Unfortunately OOP won, in the face of all alternatives, so either you like it or not, you're going to need it.<p>As to why OOP has won ... as with imperative programming in general, it's easier to wrap your head around it without much theoretical background. I have trouble seeing a 10 year-old learning category theory to be able to read/write files in Haskell (contrary to popular beliefs, you do need lots of knowledge when wanting to combine monads).<p>It's all about polymorphism, which enables composability / reuse / decoupling.<p>In OOP polymorphism is natural. In Haskel, the only static / functional language where polymorphism is done right, the learning curve is quite high.<p>Languages from the ML family are very suitable for symbolic processing (theorem proving, compilers), but OOP is versatile and can be used efficiently on a whole range of problems ... including writing compilers ... <a href=""http://tinlizzie.org/ometa/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinlizzie.org/ometa/</a><p>You might have been burnt by the static OOP languages, trouble is OOP mixes with static typing like oil and water ... take a look at Smalltalk or at CLOS sometimes. CLOS is even more capable as it supports things like multi-dispatching.",1272379832

It was punitive and petty, but they managed to nearly ruin him. This was in northern virginia, whose laws are only slightly less midievil than most.<p>So while much of the advice here is to 'get out' and 'run', the question that is not answered is 'to where'. A more reasonable response is to ask yourself if you are okay with this kind of arrangement , and if not, resign and make sure your next job doesn't have this kind of language in the contract and that you have an affirmative recognition of the kind of ip deal you want with the company.<p>This, btw, includes people in california, who's laws allow a loophole for employers the size of a truck in its anti-competition language.<p>It is always worth your time to understand what is going on around intellectual property in your jurisdiction, your contract and your personal ethics because as the OP saw, it can be difficult to resolve after the fact.",1272379648

Sometimes it was disguised. Men who did the exact same work as women had a different title, so they earned more because technically they had a different role.<p>Dutch research indicated that a big part of the 20% difference is because of the choices women make (though of course, it is still open for debate whether those choices are always true choices), but even accounting for that there was still a 7% difference that couldn't be explained (of course they also accounted for hours worked). This is a Dutch page with lots of info \n<a href=""http://www.loonwijzer.nl/home/vrouwenloonwijzer/beloningsverschillen-m-v"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.loonwijzer.nl/home/vrouwenloonwijzer/beloningsver...</a><p>It does say that the Netherlands is a bit worse than other European countries.<p>Also: I think some technical explanatins as to why it is ""logical"" that women earn less are nonsense. It makes no sense to penalize a women because she had two babies six and four years ago and therefore was out of the workplace for a few months if there is no objective difference in quality of work today.<p>I don't think danger has anything to do with pay. If it did, firefighters would earn a lot more than IT consultants. I also don't think responsibility has anything to do with it. If it did daycare workers would earn a lot more than programmers.<p>And I have never met a regular employee who honestly worked more than 50/hrs a week (in one job). In every case they could have done the work in 40 hours but they slacked off during the day (because nobody can stay focused for 10 hours a day every day). I had a parttime job once, but I never, ever browsed the internet on company time even though all the ""hard working"" 100+ euro/hour consultants were checking the popular weblogs all day long.

1298291,comment,1298124,1298124,0,0,gjm11,,,"Everything of interest here is a consequence of the author's decision to use <i>annual rate of return</i> as his figure of merit.<p>Simplified example: you have a pool of investment opportunities where with probability 0.01 you gain $100 and with probability 0.99 you lose $1. So your expected gain from making a bunch of these investments is a gain of 1c per investment. If you make a million of them then with very high probability you gain something very close to $10k in total, on your $1M investment, a 1% gain. Now, suppose each of these investment opportunities takes 10 years to do whatever it does. Then (to first order) your return rate is 0.1% per year, more or less all the time; so your average return rate is about 0.1% per year. So far, so good.<p>Now suppose that you can only make one investment. Then your annual return rate is 99^(1/10)-1, 1% of the time, and -1 the rest of the time. Key point: 99^(1/10)-1 is about 0.6, which is <i>a lot less than 99/10</i>. So your average return rate is now absolutely wretched.<p>So, have we just discovered something interesting about the real costs and benefits of high-variance investments, or merely blinded ourselves with science? The latter, I think. I'll try to explain why.<p>Why use averages to summarize things, in the first place? Because they describe what <i>usually</i> happens in the aggregate. When they fail to, or when that isn't what you care about, averaging is unlikely to tell you what you want to know. So, does our averaged return rate tell us anything useful about what happens in the aggregate? Why, no. Suppose A and B both invest $1; A loses his money and B doubles his. And suppose each of these things happens over 10 years. Then their return rates are -1 and +0.072 respectively; their average return rate is extremely negative; but A and B collectively neither gained nor lost any money. Similarly, if you make a whole lot of investments then the average of your return rates is not the same as your overall return rate. (That's exactly why the author's calculation produces the results it does.)<p>Here's another way of looking at it, which I actually prefer. There's nothing magical about <i>annual</i> return rates. But the author's curve would look completely different if he plotted <i>six-monthly</i> return rates (it would be worse [EDITED TO ADD: than the author's annualized curve) for smaller numbers of investments) or <i>five-yearly</i> return rates (it would be flat and show a positive result for any number of investments). So what the curve illustrates is not a fundamental truth about investment, it's an artefact of preferring to look at return rates over a time period that differs from the length over which the investments make whatever return they do.",1272378391

It's a fascinating area but I feel the expectations are completely out of whack with reality.  Most of the articles like this have people saying we're only a decade or two away from proper AI, when I'm arguing that that is just not backed up at all - and people are underestimating what work is involved here.<p>When expectations are set wrong, and people eventually realise it, it can damage research in this area as people don't take it seriously any more.  Ref the'AI Winter' - the dramatic cut in funding when governments realised most of the experts in the field had massively over-promised and under-delivered.<p>I think we need to break this down into smaller chunks of bounded problems.  There is some amazing research around using human like neural networks and similar processes steps for machine vision - e.g. for object recognition, trying to mimic what happens in nature.  This is greatly achievable.<p>Trying to model the entire human brain, with talk about how this will lead in the near future to intelligent, reasoning - even sentient AI - is fun but for the reasons I outlined needs an expectation reboot.",1272377871

As a (partial) replacement for experience. I've been doing this for 20+ years, and I'd encountered most of it at some point before reading the book, so it's not essential in this respect. But someone just starting out could assimilate directly a chunk of what I had to figure out on my own. And even for someone with more experience, it standardizes the details of the pattern, leading to greater consistency in the software.<p>2. To provide a common vocabulary amongst developers. When discussing a design with someone who's read the book, I can say ""I think we can solve that by using the strategy pattern"", and they'll know what I mean. Without this common vocabulary we'd spend a lot more time explaining, and at greater risk of being misunderstood.<p><i>is there a difference between ""programmer"" and ""software engineer?</i><p>This is just my philosophy, but I think that computer programming <i>in itself</i> is a simple activity, you could teach 'most anybody to write a program -- and that's the reason that so much software sucks. When done correctly it's an engineering discipline, including analysis, modeling, planning, documenting, and a certain degree of programming. But the actual implementation of code is a minority of the job.<p><i>The way I see it, we don't even need to know OO to be a good programmer. ... my current opinion about OO is that it mostly sucks</i><p>Given my definition above, I'd have to agree that you don't need to know or do OO in order to be a <i>programmer</i>. But if you aspire to the fuller job of software engineering, it would be foolish to exclude such an important tool from your repertoire.<p>Regardless of its actual merits, it's objectively true that a huge portion (I'd think even a majority) of development tools (including platforms, languages, IDEs, frameworks, libraries, etc.) are geared toward OO development. Eschewing those means that you're forgoing much of the foundational stuff that our predecessors have built for us (standing on the shoulders of giants and all).<p>I'll grant that the industry in the '90s may have been a bit manic about OO. Since then we've learned that the paradigm has weaknesses and indeed flaws. But we do generally know what those are, and have found ways to work around them. We understand now that C++ is (insanely) complex and rigid, and modern OO manages to retain most of the benefits while shedding those problems. The contemporary dynamic languages build on a foundation of OO development while avoiding many of its pitfalls (at the low level at least). And what I think of as the cutting edge, the dynamic languages, seem to have found a way to deliver their benefit while generally coexisting with the OO paradigm. Which, of course, ties back to what I said earlier about keeping your toolbox full for whatever can best solve a problem.",1272376905

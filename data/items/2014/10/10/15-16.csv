Defensive driving is about trying to stay within an envelope where you can safely respond to whatever happens. A computer system will have a different envelope, so it won&#x27;t need to do the same stuff.<p>To make a terrible analogy, a human pilot flying by eye needs to eventually make a decision to land at an alternate airport when his primary is fogged in. Is a computer smart enough to make that judgment call? Well, if the computer is equipped with a zero-zero landing system and can safely land in the fog, who cares?<p>Your question about rear threats is intriguing.

Indeed, we could have delivered Ceylon literally a year or more earlier if we had not decided to jump through so many hoops to make the Ceylon compiler generate generic type info that the Java compiler understands.<p>>> This might be (and I don&#x27;t know enough about it, so this is conjecture) one of the reasons why writing Kotlin on Android is pretty simple, while Ceylon not so much. <<<p>Well, no, I don&#x27;t think so. It&#x27;s not that _Ceylon_ doesn&#x27;t have great Java interop; it&#x27;s that _Android_ is not quite fully Java compatible! I can&#x27;t just say to you: &quot;oh, it&#x27;s Java, so it will work&quot;. No; we can&#x27;t depend on that.<p>But really the only reason that we don&#x27;t have a welldefined story for running Ceylon on Android is simply that we haven&#x27;t had time (yet) to invest the effort into trying it out and finding any sources of discomfort and fixing them and making it work, whereas perhaps the Kotlin team has done that already.<p>But we _will_ work on this, and I&#x27;m certain that we&#x27;ll be able to make it work.<p>>>  Kotlin also compiles to JavaScript, but it&#x27;s much more a &quot;hosted&quot; language than one that tries to abstract away the host&#x27;s native APIs. <<<p>Well the problem is that if you don&#x27;t abstract away from the VM with your language module, and instead try to treat java.lang+java.util+whatever as providing your basic language types, or as dependencies of the module that provides your basic language types, then you simply _don&#x27;t have a well-defined foundation for cross-platform development_.<p>* First, because the Java SDK itself is not modular, and the &quot;boundaries&quot; of what bit of the SDK is Java&#x27;s &quot;language module&quot; is ill-defined. This is a real concrete problem for people who develop on GWT, so it&#x27;s not some theoretical concern that I&#x27;m inventing!\n* Second, because even if you _could_ clearly discern the boundaries of java.base, there are plenty bits of it which _simply can&#x27;t be implemented in JavaScript_. Seriously, there are a bunch of operations that I would love to add to ceylon.language, but can&#x27;t, because they are simply unimplementable in JS.\n* Third, because _the basic types of the Java language_ are only meaningful on the JVM! You have types like long, and double whose semantics are 64-bit precision, and int and float whose semantics are 32-bit precision. But on a JavaScript VM, all numbers have 53 bits of precision! So the basic semantics of the type simply can&#x27;t be satisfied. On the Dart VM, the situation is a lot better, since at least the two numeric types they have are both 64 bit, but that still leaves int, short, float as basically completely meaningless types.<p>So if you&#x27;re truly serious about JavaScript VMs or the Dart VM or whatever as a real target platform for your language, you need to design your language and language module for that.<p>>> adopting Ceylon today, I think, is a much bigger risk than adopting Kotlin. <<<p>I&#x27;m not arguing, nor I would I ever argue, that there are no sources of discomfort that arise from having a cross-platform language module. There surely are, but they&#x27;re minor, they&#x27;re well-defined, and they&#x27;re essentially very easy to work with. We&#x27;ve already written quite a lot of code that makes heavy use of Java libraries, and we&#x27;ve been identifying sources of discomfort and fixing them when/where necessary as we go along.<p>Nor would I suggest that there were no bugs/limitations in Ceylon 1.0. There were! And we fixed the ones we found. And surely we&#x27;ll find a couple more in Ceylon 1.1. But we remain deeply committed to fixing such bugs.<p>Given that, calling it a &quot;risk&quot; is, I think, a bit of an unfair characterization. A &quot;source of occasional discomfort&quot;, would be fairer.",1412956705

And thanks to the myth of the rational voter, there are plenty of people who decide that the appearance at one level is sufficient, and the cost/benefit of digging deeper isn&#x27;t worthwhile.<p>On the surface, Obama was happy to allow people to believe something different even from what he was actually saying. Many pacifists supported him on this basis.<p>A level deeper, Obama was <i>never</i> anti-war. If you go back to the record, his only anti-war statements were specific to Iraq. He disliked the politics of that particular war, but never came out as a pacifist (contra those only looking skin-deep).<p>Deeper than that, we&#x27;ve got to consider political motivations behind his anti-Iraq-war stance. In retrospect it appears that this was largely a political position that was easy for Obama to take on because it entailed undermining GWB&#x27;s (arguably illegally assumed) authority, thus shifting power away from the GOP and toward the DEMs. In this light, it&#x27;s hardly surprising that he&#x27;s chosen to eschew his opposition to unilateral executive power: when the shoe was on the other foot, he was able to obtain further political advantage by doubling down on the same abuses that he&#x27;d criticized just a few years earlier.",1412956557

ZFS is a copy-on-write file system and relocates all writes to free disk space.\nKeeping a certain amount of free blocks allows ZFS to easily find space in big chunks, allows ZFS to\naggregate writes and reduce the write IOPS demand on hard disks. Streaming aggregated writes can be\n50-100 times less demanding on hard drives than doing small random writes. Therefore, the incentive\nfor keeping free space is high, especially in a high churn environment, such as an active OLTP\ndatabase.<p>>The number one\nrule for setting up an Oracle database on ZFS is to set ZFS\nrecordsize\nequal to\nthe database block size for the file systems that contain the Oracle data files.\nrecordsize = db_block_size",1412956261

Obviously it&#x27;s wrong for me to disqualify you from discussion your own experience - but it seemed to me like you were generalizing your experience to apply to everyone else and claim that depression therapy is humbug, which is also wrong. As you say, &quot;human experience can&#x27;t be completely generalised&quot;.<p>A therapist who completely discounts external factors in treating depression seems to me rather incompetent. But then, external factors can and should be changed by direct actions. But a depressed patient may not have the will or energy to change them - in which case the problem really is the depression.

8438188,comment,8436496,8436496,0,0,bkirwi,,,"The study argues that most bugs found in production can be reproduced with simple test cases. This does <i>not</i> imply that just adding a bunch of simple test cases would have prevented these bugs. At least some of the tested projects have very large test suites, and all of these bugs made it through that first line of defense.<p>All this implies that the projects weren&#x27;t testing the right stuff. The suggestion to spend more time thinking about error cases is probably a good one; in almost all cases people forget about the fascinating variety of ways in which things might fail. On the other hand, when you have a large number of permutations to test, things get a lot messier:<p>> The specific order of events is important in 88% of the failures that require multiple input events.<p>In cases like this, you get a lot more mileage out of Jepsen-style torture testing and QuickCheck-style property testing, where the code is tested with large numbers of random inputs. This simplifies the programmer&#x27;s job a lot, since they&#x27;re no longer responsible for intuiting an exact series of inputs that might make something fall over.<p>Of course, not all failures are even this difficult to flush out. It&#x27;s interesting that the authors got quite quick and substantial gains from their code analysis tool, especially when you look at how simple it is:<p>> (i) the error handler is simply empty or only contains a log printing statement, (ii) the error handler aborts the cluster on an overly-general exception, and (iii) the error handler contains expressions like “FIXME” or “TODO” in the comments",1412954873

Why can&#x27;t I generate a shell string in the same way that I generate a SQL string? E.g.:<p><pre><code>  sprintf(&quot;mv %t %t&quot;, src, dest);\n</code></pre>\nWhere &quot;%t&quot; is a special token that shell-escapes the input (e.g. &quot;My File Name.txt&quot; => &quot;My\ File\ Name.txt&quot;). Instead it&#x27;s something where people continue to use ad-hoc, incomplete, of &#x27;implemented everywhere&#x27; solutions to this.<p>Note: I don&#x27;t generate SQL strings with sprintf(), but it&#x27;s a close approximation of:<p><pre><code>  execute(&#x27;select * from table where id = ?&#x27;, id);</code></pre>",1412953962

The Unix philosophy has broken the minds of generations of programmers. It leads them to doing things like concatenating strings to build SQL queries or doing IPC with ad-hoc regex-parsed protocols or using a couple of magical characters to indicate that the contents of a variable should be parsed and executed instead of just stored.<p>Yes! And then to compensate, they have to &quot;sanitize&quot; untrusted input to their systems. I had a meeting yesterday with a developer and a project manager at an organization that wants to work with my company to integrate one of our products with one of theirs. I mentioned the possibility of submitting some data in JSON format to a web API on their end, and the project manager asked about the risk of code injection attacks, by which he apparently meant SQL injection. I had to assure him, based on my knowledge of their tech stack (Node.js, CouchDB, and naturally, JSON) that code injection wouldn&#x27;t be an issue. My point is that the common abuses of strings by Unix and web developers have led to well-known and widely feared security vulnerabilities which just don&#x27;t exist in software that&#x27;s built on a foundation of properly structured data.<p>See also this classic by Glyph Lefkowitz:<p><a href=""https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2008/06/data-in-garbage-out.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2008/06/data-in-garbage-out....</a>",1412953240

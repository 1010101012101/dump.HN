I have no problem doing day to day jobs as long as I&#x27;m am important part of the business. However, if I feel neglected then I ask questions on what would be the future like and what works are coming. In many occasions owners have no answers.<p>On top of that I have tried a lot of things now and am pretty sure I want to be a programmer/developer/engineer/whatever whose contribution is valued.",1436597859

I am also very much overconfident about my abilities as a programmer.<p>Now something good about me is that I truly love Computer Science and software engineering, and I want to get better at it. It is that very passion that is motivating me to change; I have read about how mediocre engineers are overconfident and full of themselves.<p>I want to excel at software engineering, and I know that I first need to change. My question to the community is the following:<p>Have you ever felt overconfident (as paradoxal as it may sound)? How do you develop an object, down-to-earth knowledge of what you can or cannot do? How do you learn humility?<p>I feel like providing some context would help the community. I am a college student, interning at a big tech company. I am somewhat shocked by my immaturity or arrogance.<p>For example, one of my coworkers is a great engineer, he has been contributing a lot and very positively to the codebase. But I cannot resist looking down on him because his resume sucks, and he has never worked on a major OSS project or went to an elite school.<p>Yes, this is how stupid and flawed my reasoning is. Me, a not-even-junior engineer, looking down on someone who has over a decade of experience for completely superficial reasons.<p>Among other things, I tend to overestimate my abilities to solve problems and tend to set unrealistic deadlines. I am also very impatient.<p>I need your help to get rid of this shitty mentality, and I am not happy with thinking that way. I know it is very narrow-minded and full of elitist bullshit.

9868829,comment,9866648,9868415,0,0,miguelrochefort,,,"I&#x27;m being extremist for the sake of argument and consistency. I don&#x27;t recommend you go out and live a completely transparent life today when the rest of society is not ready. So many things in today&#x27;s society rely on some expectation of privacy, which currently makes the transition impractical. An example of that is private key cryptography.<p>Although not very good at it, my purpose here is to bring awareness to the unsustainable nature of privacy, and demonstrate some benefits of transparency. I want people to adopt a long-term outlook and eventually reach these conclusions themselves. I&#x27;ve been thinking about that a lot, playing the devil&#x27;s advocate for both sides, and I honestly can&#x27;t see anything good coming from this reliance on privacy. I have some trouble understanding how that&#x27;s not obvious to more people.<p>Many people on HN are looking for problems to solve, but have trouble finding them. I&#x27;ve often claimed that problems are some of the easiest things to find, and I&#x27;ll show you an example here. Privacy is like a band-aid. It doesn&#x27;t solve the underlying cause of problems. It just makes the problem go away, out of sight out of mind. It quickly became <i>the</i> go-to way to fix non-trivial problems, usually through some kind of law enforcement. Exactly like SOPA/PIPA, patents, copyrights, and censorship in general. I don&#x27;t know why these things have different names, because they&#x27;re all exactly the same things. And I mean exactly.<p>When privacy is hypothetically removed, people come up with a ton of potential problems. Private key encryption is one of them (&quot;people will know your password&quot;). The business opportunity here would be to to allow authentication, prevent fraud, and maybe secure systems without the use of password or secret keys. I said &quot;maybe&quot; because we probably should re-evaluate the concept of private property in the first place (which could reduce our reliance on security, for example).<p>I&#x27;m not throwing the baby out with the bathwater. If you understand privacy as being intrinsically valuable, then it might look like it.  But my argument goes beyond that. My claim is that privacy has no intrinsic value, and is actually evil. I&#x27;m not giving up on privacy because it&#x27;s too hard, I&#x27;m actively trying to get rid of it. Even if we had some magic that would lead to perfect security and privacy, I would advocate against it.<p>Let&#x27;s make something else clear. I value freedom enormously, and I&#x27;m strictly opposed to coercion. Nobody will be forced to be transparent if they decide not to. They can build their houses out of tin if they don&#x27;t want people to spy on them using thermal vision. You will be allowed to lie if you want. The only difference, is that people will remember that you lied, or didn&#x27;t cooperate into sharing valuable facts, and that will hurt your reputation. In a future where your reputation is everything, you will have difficulty finding people that will trust you and accept to do business with you. Selfishness, while a totally legal choice, likely won&#x27;t be rewarded.",1436597441

For example, HN strongly discourages attacking another member personally (eg. calling someone else idiot).  I consider this a reasonable limit on freedom of speech, but concepts and opinions should be fully open for discussion (eg. pro/anti evolution etc).  If the discussions are respectful, then anything should be allowed.<p>I believe Political Correctness has done more harm than it does good.  It has created an unhealthy focus on skin colour, reproductive organs, etc to the point of lunacy.  Many people struggle to look past superficial features and seem to lost the ability to make reasoned judgements.  Any criticism of a woman gets you labelled a misogynist, regardless of how incapable she is.  This continues to undermine the credibility of women that are truly capable in their own right.  I&#x27;m currently managing a team of women.  They all got there on their own merit.  I would not hire a woman for the sake of political correctness or because I was bullied by a feminist journalist (as is quite common these days).  The women in my team were not selected based on their gender - they were selected based on their talents and attitudes.  They were available and capable.<p>This whole Ellen Pao incident made me think about the validity of comments on sexism and racism that are floating around the net.  Compare the attitudes towards the criticisms of Steve Ballmer vs Ellen Pao.  One of these individuals contributed to the significant growth of Microsoft, the other didn&#x27;t manage to achieve much that stands out.  Both developed a bad reputation as leaders.  Yet, one of these people is being defended and the other is not.  The major difference (other than Ballmer&#x27;s financial track record for Microsoft) is their genders.  Political Correctness has driven the need to blindly defend women, no matter how incompetent they may be.  The hope is that this behaviour will help &quot;women&#x27;s rights&quot;<i>.  I view it as doing the exact opposite ... &quot;jobs for the girls&quot;.<p>It saddens me that we seem to be more sexist, less tolerant and more willing to defend incompetence an an attempt to promote rights for selected members of society.<p></i>On a side note, I dislike the term &quot;women&#x27;s rights&quot;.  Is it so hard to represent &quot;people&#x27;s rights&quot;?  I believe one of these reflects a destructive, prejudiced mindset and creates a bad attitude of entitlement and encourages sexism.

I&#x27;m also not very good at communicating, so I&#x27;m sorry that I&#x27;ve done a bad job.<p>First, deal with Google. Given your felony conviction, and the shitty college rag stories about your arrest, you need to mount simple, positive PR campaign. Create a website S....tA....ski.com, and an about.me page. Maybe a twitter, @S....tA....ski, and a Discuss account. On these properties, you&#x27;ll need to communicate a very fluffy image, where you say nice things about yourself. The goal being to push the old, no good stories off the front page of google.com<p>Marketing is about finding an audience, and communicating the value you provide to them.<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen of ParIni, it looks like you&#x27;re hanging your shingle as a web app developer who&#x27;s super focused on security. That&#x27;s great, now you need to find an audience.<p>You know much more about your market than I do, but a really great resource I&#x27;ve found has been forums that contain people who could be your customers. One mistake I&#x27;ve made is to find forums of people who are more like me, than my customers. In your case, it could be app-sec developers. The focus should be on people who own, or need app-sec.<p>Now that you&#x27;ve found a forum of potential customers, you want to create an account(use a personal name, not corporate), set up some keyword alerts, and lurk. For app-sec, keyword alerts could be something like bcrypt, or scrypt, or heartbleed. You&#x27;ll know best what keywords to use.<p>After you&#x27;ve seen how the forum works, understand the lingo, and decorum, start being a positive contributor. When someone asks a question, write a good answer. If the forum allows it, answer old, unanswered questions. Be as helpful as possible, and you will be seen as an expert in this community.<p>As you gain status, people will mention you when they need someone with your expertise. Gradually, people will find your posts, and reach out to you asking for help. These people are now leads, and you did a marketing.<p>One thing to keep in mind is that you don&#x27;t go from maligned employee to $XY,000 per week over night. You&#x27;re going to want to think of smaller steps, how do I go from maligned employee to someone giving me a dollar for doing app-sec.<p>As for specific resources, read the books, &#x27;Double Your Freelancing Rate&#x27;, and &#x27;Double Your Freelancing Clients&#x27;. Both books really teach some fundamental skills that are not intuitive. The main thing I got from &#x27;Rate&#x27; was how to practice empathy with my clients.",1436595578

But, besides it not being in the DSM, and nevermind the fact the DSM is its&#x27; self sketchy in many ways... lol...

It&#x27;s not really driven by steam power at all; it uses steam and water to create a partial vacuum, so that atmospheric pressure pushes the very leaky piston into the partially evacuated cylinder.<p>Watt realized that cooling the cylinder on every cycle was just silly.  Exhaust the steam for cooling elsewhere.  (If you&#x27;ve got the water, don&#x27;t even bother condensing it.  Few steam locomotives carried condensers and thus required huge amounts of water.)  He also used a little steam pressure on the cylinder; not much, only a few PSI. That was possible with machining no better than that used for Newcomen engines.<p>To go better than that, you have to have better boilers (ones that don&#x27;t leak or blow up) and cylinders that don&#x27;t leak so badly.  One of the early specs for a cylinder/piston fit was that they should fit well enough that a shilling coin couldn&#x27;t be pushed between them.<p>The next big breakthrough was when Wilkenson, who had a cannon-boring business and knew how to make a big accurate round hole in iron, got one of Watt&#x27;s engines for his cannon foundry.  Wilkenson saw how badly the thing leaked and how poorly the piston fit the cylinder.  He realized that if he used his cannon-boring machine to make a steam engine cylinder, the engine would leak far less and do far more work.  So he did, and cut a deal with Watt to make cylinders.<p>That made steam engines much more cost-effective and more widely useful, and launched the steam era.  The next century was about getting the temperatures and pressures up without boiler explosions.",1436595133

In particular, CPUC (the statewide utility regulator) lets electric utilities, both municipal (e.g. SMUD) and investor-owned (e.g. PG&E), charge higher rates if they implement energy efficiency or demand-side management measure to reduce total demand, allowing the utility to maintain about the same level of profitability but at reduced energy consumption.

I mean who wouldn't say to a good startup, that multiple parties see potential in, saying.. you're past the time limit we'll pass.  Financially thats not a good idea.  But in the end decisions need to be made and overall its good for all parties for yc to work with the startups that are put in this position.",1237797907

528238,comment,527500,527653,0,0,trezor,,,"Thanks for clearing that up. That statement makes a lot more sense.<p>There are a lot of free javascript libraries out there, and quite a few which doesn't directly involve server-callbacks, and leaves you with the power to hook things together as you please. In that case, free javascript libraries still makes a lot of sense.<p>For situations where the bulk of the solution is actually server-side code, I wouldn't really call that a ""javascript library"", but some regular server-side solution with added javascript/AJAX functionality. And in <i>those</i> cases I can be willing to agree with your statement.",1237797149

528233,comment,527500,528039,0,0,derefr,,,"> Since it doesn't have to be free as in beer<p>Neither does FOSS software, you realize. Let's say Google charged money for Google Earth. Now, if they open-sourced the client, they would still make money from it, because they'd still be the only one with the license to the map tiles themselves. There are many situations like this, where the software is actually worthless without some resource (perhaps just your brand) that you provide alongside it. You can make plenty of money selling water (a FOSS product)--but remember, it's the bottles that people are buying; the water is obviously worthless when you just pour all over them (or release the source to them.)<p>> The GPL is actually less ""free"" than a BSD style license because of his campaign to promote free software.<p>Here's a thought-experiment that I think shows you RMS's world-view. Pretend, for a second, that AI existed. The GPL would give it rights (it would be ""free""), while the BSD license would allow it to be sold into slavery (""non-free."")",1237796587

528229,comment,527873,528090,0,0,azanar,,,"The positive value that prostitutes deliver to the world is very fleeting. An orgasm lasts at most several seconds. After a few days, the average male will be jonesing again.<p>The long term value production of the average prostitute strikes me as damn near zero, unless the outlet prevents the john from sexually assaulting someone else. I agree, though, that the short term value can be quite high, and I think that is what people pay for.<p>It seems to me that value delivered to a sufficiently large audience would have to be of the long-term variety, because otherwise it wouldn't last long enough to get sufficiently dispersed. It's possible something might contradict that assertion, but I can't think of any examples right now.",1237796355

528221,comment,527873,527956,0,0,azanar,,,"I get the suspicion the causal progression here is deeper than just f(intelligence) - g(wages) = 0.<p>As an alternate hypothesis, the reason why students who study what they love earn less than students who study something practical is because of the intrinsic value the student finds being employed to do what they love. As a result of this, they don't need or demand to be paid as much to perform the same work, and so salaries tend to be depressed.<p>But maybe it doesn't bother them; maybe there is something to the advice more intelligent people are given. Perhaps the needs most people fulfill by earning and spending money have already been fulfilled by these people through other means. If you do what you love by trade, perhaps there is less need to spend money in exchange for spare time to work on it.",1237795751

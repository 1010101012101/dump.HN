It would make sense, perhaps, if your major league franchise controlled enough minor league teams, to use them as guinea pigs.  The players and coaches might get a bit upset by being used like that though.",1197431021

88547,comment,88005,88445,0,0,whacked_new,,,"At the current state of research, nobody claims to know enough about how the brain works to conclude that the mind is ""an empty plate of neuron waiting to be connected."" Trisomy 21, or Down Syndrome, can be classified as mental retardation, and you might call it an abnormal lack of mental capacity. This is a completely genetic abnormality. Obviously, they go through the same stages of neonatal development, neuron pruning, etc., but their ability to form neuronal connections, like yours and mine, is limited, at birth.<p>I picked a rather extreme example just to illustrate the point. I don't disagree with everything you wrote, but it is a mistake to believe early manifestations of genius have nothing, or even little, innate roots. Daniel Tammet is your living example. If his brain were a bit different, he'd be just another Kim Peek. It will be <i>very</i> hard to argue that this is due to rigorous practice from an early age. Kids with autism don't just gradually lose their aptitude to comprehend emotions by lack of practice. They are born with a dysfunctional empathy circuit. Kids with epilepsy don't just develop their symptoms. They are testable and predictable, and heritable.<p>I'm not saying what you say is wrong -- it depends on what you mean by intelligence. But you're being unspecific about ""intelligence"" while being specific about how it is related to genetic, inborn traits. This opens the door wide to attacks like mine -- just pointing it out.<p>One more thing. The statement ""The theory of races after all started in Germany"" evaluates to false. I assume you're referring to early 20th century Germany. It started with the European colonialists, which wasn't even such a German thing. That's also the Eurocentric interpretation of the word. I'm sure other cultures had their own ideas of race dating to much earlier. The Chinese always called the people outside their country borders barbarians. And Orthodox Jews consider themselves the chosen people. Take that interpretation, then I'm among the unchosen barbarians, or race, whatever.",1197430491

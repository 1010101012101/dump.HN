If some acquaintance was in Mumbai, if it werent for Facebook, I wouldnt even know they were there in the first place. And I dont want to! I mean, I really dont feel the need to know the lives of 400 different people! I dont have the emotional energy to actually empathise with all of them.

4619454,story,,,2,1,thrillerbin,"Automated Kiosk for Novels? (Redbox for books)",,"Hi,
I wanted to know what some of you thought of an automated kiosk for books. Basically, for a small fee of around $2 a month, you could go to a box, select your novel, then go ahead and read it for as long as you want. I know ebooks are where it's at these days, but I just keep running into people who love and miss the feel of real books, yet find it inconvenient to go to a bookstore or library to get one book. That is why I think placing a kiosk at places people go to all the time, such as super markets, gas stations, street corners, etc, will allow people to come across these machines without having to go out of their way.  They will be going to places they normally go to various times a week.<p>Therefore, I just wanted some feedback on the idea. Would you use it or not? The pricing point would have to be very low, which I think $2 a month is. I feel if it works for DVDs, then it can work for novels, please let let me know what you think!
Thanks!",1349487210

The UI is not friendly, the purpose behind it are not even what I'm looking for. I didnt realize AWS was delivering such a raw platform, meaning... 'we provide a machine, you do the rest'.

Basically, if people are made to write an essay in favor of a position (like for or against abortion), even if it's one they initially disagree with, their opinions will be measurably more sympathetic to that position afterwards. So maybe this isn't entirely dumb after all.<p>Obviously, there's a big gap between writing an essay and typing a single word. Supposedly, the trigger was having to consider the reasoning behind a position, which you don't have to do to type just one word. But who knows, maybe the cumulative effect could actually do something.<p>Note also that this isn't a real captcha, in the traditional sense. It doesn't work by keeping the trolls out. It works by making them slightly less troll-ish, through repeated exposure. While outwardly similar, it's a very different model, and you would not expect any immediate effect.",1349485623

There will be still some trolls that will fill in the correct word in the captcha and say stupid shit in the comment. Asking for someone to think morally for a brief second is not going to stop people. This is ""just another captcha"" to most.<p>I don't think it's effective against bots either. If a bot can read the three options it has a 1/3 chance of getting it right (assuming that the bot would choose randomly). In fact from the sample captcha it looks like one of the words is not like the others and therefore you could possibly eliminate that making it a 50:50 chance (again assuming it picks it randomly, that there's an odd one out, and that the odd one out is unrelated to the text above).<p>Although, I suppose that the idea of the captcha is to show awareness, rather than actually stop spam or trolling.

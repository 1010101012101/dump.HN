He gives a practical use for divination:<p>""The multitude of available divination techniques are very useful for determining your own semi-conscious desires, as they each present a complete ambiguous and random pattern that your own subconscious will assign meaning to.""<p>It reminds me of Douglas Adams' speech, ""Is there an artificial God?""<p>""Apparently, we need to think about the building being inhabited by dragons and look at it in terms of how a dragon would move around it... This sounds like complete and utter nonsense, because anything involving dragons must be nonsense... Nevertheless... it may be there is something interesting going on... You figure out how the dragon's going to be happy here and lo and behold! you've suddenly got a place that makes sense for other organic creatures, such as ourselves, to live in.""<p><a href=""http://www.biota.org/people/douglasadams/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.biota.org/people/douglasadams/</a>",1227275565

It hardly seems objective these days.<p>There's also a self-fulfilling prophecy problem with media coverage of economic information.   If you tell everyone things are getting bad, it would seem rational that they would sell their assets (making things worse).  If you say there's no bottom in sight, not many people would feel like re-entering the market.",1227274832

Rather than disagree and state your reasons you would choose to escalate this into an attack on someone's livelihood. This is intended to be a community where we can speak freely among our peers, and you and your little cheerleading posse have perverted that.<p>I'm really trying to understand where you're coming from. I don't know if this is simply a last resort because you're unable to articulate exactly why you so vehemently disagree or if this is a threat you intend to follow through with. I can assure you that if you do, in fact, intend to avoid doing business or associating with those you have disagreed with at one time or another you are going to be living in a very lonely world.",1227273331

7469911,comment,7468193,7469804,4,0,ArbitraryLimits,,,"> Lagrange interpolations are only distantly related to Legendre/Hermite/etc polynomials<p>Actually ... take an nth degree polynomial from your favorite orthogonal set.  For each of its n+1 zeros, construct by Lagrange interpolation the polynomial which is 1 at that zero and 0 at the others.  Then that set of n+1 interpolating polynomials has the same relation to the orthogonal polynomials of degree 0 through n that (periodized) sincs have to sinusoids, i.e. you can decompose an n degree or lower polynomial in either basis, and the two representations are related by something like a Fourier transform.",1395788381

Oculus Rift is about bringing hyper-immersive 3D to the wearer, Google Glass is about moving the Google interface to the eyeball. It&#x27;s like comparing a 4k TV to a Chromebook.

There are probably a few papers on writing GTA5 and World of Warcraft too. Unfortunately, almost no-one is writing about how to do Tetris, Mario or Wolfenstein 3D.<p>I suspect one of the biggest barriers to adoption that Haskell specifically has is the gaping void in intermediate-level material. When the concepts are so alien to what most programmers work with, even those with some basic knowledge of functional programming ideas more generally, you really need the books or websites that come after things like RWH or LYAHFGG -- things that show how to build non-trivial software, scaling up the toy examples to something more realistic.<p>It&#x27;s great to see sites like the one that started this discussion trying to bridge that gap, but I suggest that understanding relatively obscure things like heavyweight parsing frameworks or lenses isn&#x27;t the most important goal. While they are certainly interesting ideas, this feels like trying to teach people how to write a chess AI with an 1800 rating.

7469812,comment,7469516,7469516,1,0,tjr,,,"It takes a long time for widespread adoption of a programming language in schools. 15-20 years ago you likely would have seen some mix of Pascal and C++. Pascal came into popularity as it was pushed expressly as a teaching language. For learning basic principles of computer programming, it was fair enough, but its fan base dwindled over time, and never was a great candidate to use outside of the classroom.<p>C++ was (and is) broadly used in real applications, but is also a mess for beginners to learn.<p>Java was a reasonably decent choice to move to: it was more beginner-friendly than C++, and, thanks to most excellent marketing from Sun Microsystems, it quickly became entrenched in numerous corporations as a replacement for COBOL and for building web applications, making it useful to learn for programming outside of class.<p>Looking back on the late 1990s, the Java bandwagon was intense. It was being pushed all over the place, by people both in industry and academia. It was definitely an improvement for many programmers; depending on what kind of software you were writing, Java could have been a huge benefit over C or C++. Much of its praise was well-deserved, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen a programming platform pushed so hard and so loud since then.<p>What&#x27;s in the AP classes today is a direct result of the Java fanfare of ~15 years ago.

7469804,comment,7468193,7469072,2,0,jjoonathan,,,"> You can take a general function and break it into its &#x27;component&#x27; polynomial terms, this is called the taylor series.<p>> Fourier transform is essentially similar to the fourier series except you&#x27;re allowed to have non-integer frequency multiples.<p>Not really. Taylor series are &quot;optimal&quot; in a completely different way from Fourier series. Since the &quot;decomposition strategy&quot; used by Fourier series is completely general (there are polynomial equivalents of the Fourier Series) it&#x27;s worth drawing the distinction.<p>The Taylor Series gets all of its information from the neighborhood of a single point. Thought experiment: consider the curve e^x. Now set it to 0 everywhere outside of the interval (-e,e) where e is arbitrarily small. Now take the taylor series of the curve at the point x=0. You get back the original curve e^x -- the Taylor Series completely ignores the fact that your curve no longer looks anything like e^x! You can do even worse than that: paste a tiny, almost-linear segment of 1+sin(x) into e^x around the origin. You couldn&#x27;t tell the difference looking at the curve (they both look like e^x) but the Taylor series would converge to the sin, not to the e^x curve you &quot;transplanted&quot; the patch into. Taylor series are good for answering the question &quot;How does f(x) change if I nudge x a bit?&quot; but they are very bad at answering the question &quot;what polynomial best approximates f(x) over its domain?&quot;.<p>If you want to answer the latter question, you should use linear algebra and change of basis / orthogonal filter banks / whatever you want to call it. This is the trick used by the Fourier Series and the Discrete/Fast Fourier Transform. It works for polynomials too: google &quot;Legendre polynomials&quot; or &quot;Hermite polynomials&quot; for more information on polynomial analogs of the Fourier Series (if you haven&#x27;t had linear algebra, I highly recommend Axler&#x27;s book, which will teach you how to use generalized inner products to perform this trick). There&#x27;s a second type of polynomial approximation called &quot;Lagrange interpolation&quot; which approximates a function using polynomials by evaluating it at certain points rather than by integrating it. Lagrange interpolations are only distantly related to Legendre/Hermite/etc polynomials but both strategies answer the question of &quot;what polynomial best approximates f(x) over its domain?&quot; much better than Taylor series.<p>Also, if you ever want to learn how MP3/JPG compression actually works, you&#x27;ll want the DCT, which is another relative of the FFT. If you know the relevant linear algebra, the distinction is trivial (DCT has implied &quot;mirror&quot; symmetry at the endpoints rather than &quot;wrap&quot; symmetry so you don&#x27;t get ringing if the color changes from one edge of a block to the other). DCT, FFT, Legendre polynomial approximation, Hermite polynomial approximation, etc all use the same simple trick (cue &quot;one weird trick&quot; ad). If you don&#x27;t know the relevant linear algebra, it&#x27;s a bunch of black magic. But the relevant math is accessible enough that I highly recommend looking into it. I&#x27;ve already mentioned Axler&#x27;s book (Linear Algebra Done Right) -- it&#x27;s accessible to anyone with a semester or two of calculus under their belt and it&#x27;ll get you to the point of understanding how all of these transforms are basically just rotation matrices for high-dimensional spaces (one dimension for every point you evaluate the function at) within a few chapters.<p>The key is to understand the distinction between vectors/operators as understood by mathematicians and the blocks of numbers called vectors/matrices by engineers. The latter are like a shadow cast by the former. Learn about the former and you&#x27;ll see that the DCT, FFT, etc are shadows of the exact same concept as the familiar triplets of real numbers, just cast at a different angle, if that makes sense.",1395787496

My aim was to ask if doing startup is such a &quot;must to do&quot; thing for certain kind of folks, then he should be doing it again, and again (and not stop after the first one and then start advising only). While I never got a direct answer to that one, he did answer this in another forum the same thing - which basically boiled down to - that doing startup is too much work, and he does not want spend his time doing that. I really do think, that doing startup is not such a sexy thing as it is portrayed it to be. I feel it is another of those things in life, where primary reason for most folks for doing a startup is that you will seem more &quot;important&quot; a person, after you have a successful startup. Otherwise you are just an ordinary dude with 9-5 job.  I truly wonder how many folks actually do it because it is more fun and adventure, than pain and stress(most of the time).

It re-ignited the browser wars and caused so many good things to happen.<p>This is obviously counterbalanced by the personal beliefs held by the now-CEO of the company. Where do you draw the line? Does the decade of browsers-now-use-web-standards get lost because Eich has questionable politics? To wit: Chik Fil-et had the same issue but I still eat there. Why? Because the company is full of good, hard-working people and I like the food. The CEO may not share my beliefs but does that automatically destroy everything else that might be good about that company?<p>These are all rhetorical questions.",1395785257

They’re windows into worlds that let us travel somewhere fantastic. My foray into virtual reality was driven by a desire to enhance my gaming experience; to make my rig more than just a window to these worlds, to actually let me step inside them. As time went on, I realized that VR technology wasn’t just possible, it was almost ready to move into the mainstream. All it needed was the right push.\nWe started Oculus VR with the vision of making virtual reality affordable and accessible, to allow everyone to experience the impossible. With the help of an incredible community, we’ve received orders for over 75,000 development kits from game developers, content creators, and artists around the world. When Facebook first approached us about partnering, I was skeptical. As I learned more about the company and its vision and spoke with Mark, the partnership not only made sense, but became the clear and obvious path to delivering virtual reality to everyone. Facebook was founded with the vision of making the world a more connected place. Virtual reality is a medium that allows us to share experiences with others in ways that were never before possible.\nFacebook is run in an open way that’s aligned with Oculus’ culture. Over the last decade, Mark and Facebook have been champions of open software and hardware, pushing the envelope of innovation for the entire tech industry. As Facebook has grown, they’ve continued to invest in efforts like with the Open Compute Project, their initiative that aims to drive innovation and reduce the cost of computing infrastructure across the industry. This is a team that’s used to making bold bets on the future.\nIn the end, I kept coming back to a question we always ask ourselves every day at Oculus: what’s best for the future of virtual reality? Partnering with Mark and the Facebook team is a unique and powerful opportunity. The partnership accelerates our vision, allows us to execute on some of our most creative ideas and take risks that were otherwise impossible. Most importantly, it means a better Oculus Rift with fewer compromises even faster than we anticipated.\nVery little changes day-to-day at Oculus, although we’ll have substantially more resources to build the right team. If you want to come work on these hard problems in computer vision, graphics, input, and audio, please apply!\nThis is a special moment for the gaming industry — Oculus’ somewhat unpredictable future just became crystal clear: virtual reality is coming, and it’s going to change the way we play games forever.\nI’m obsessed with VR. I spend every day pushing further, and every night dreaming of where we are going. Even in my wildest dreams, I never imagined we’d come so far so fast.\nI’m proud to be a member of this community — thank you all for carrying virtual reality and gaming forward and trusting in us to deliver. We won’t let you down.&quot;<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/21cy9n/the_future_of_vr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/21cy9n/the_future_of...</a>",1395784800

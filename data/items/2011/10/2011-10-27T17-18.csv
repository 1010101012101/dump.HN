3164540,comment,3162927,3164221,11,0,dxbydt,,,"> Is this common?<p>Well, its not uncommon. From my unscientific survey among my colleagues I'd say ppl who don't own machines is upwards of 60%. Its not hard to see why. Banks work you quite hard anyways. I stare at a PC 8 hours a day. Plus there's the pager so you can respond to calls at night & so on...the association of PC=Work becomes quite hardwired. Last thing I'd want to do is muck around with a computer at home as well. If I buy a PC/Mac, like a desktop with monitor, where do I keep it ? I have to buy a computer desk and  computer chair and all that? Dude I live in a tiny apartment 10 minutes from the bank. There's no space.
As to keeping up with my skills - I've been doing this some dozen plus years at this point. I will say if you know how to fold and write a parser combinator, you are golden. I know both, so my comp science degree wasn't a total waste. Most of what I do is just some combination of map reduce filter fold partition, occasionally some lazy eval/Stream, some memoization, rest is just standard finance - portfolio theory, capm, derivatives, option pricing, stochastic calculus etc - you learn those at school anyways, otherwise they won't give you a diploma, and the bank won't hire you without a diploma.",1319738265

3164511,comment,3161853,3161853,2,0,leeHS,,,"Based on how meiosis works, I can see how methylation could be passed down to offspring.  But these changes in methylation would have to occur within the specialized cells which produce sperm and egg. If the methylation pattern changes in your liver or heart cells, it doesn't matter since these somatic cells don't get to pass this information on to offspring.<p>Females are born with all their eggs, so any changes in methylation that occur to these eggs will persist into adulthood (I assume). But is it possible that these eggs are somehow protected from this alteration? As for sperm, these are produced within the testes following puberty, and are generated continuously. Therefore, in order to pass down altered methylation, the original gamete cells responsible for generating sperm would have to be altered. But if you wanted to do this successfully, you'd have to make sure to alter ALL the gamete cells. Otherwise you're gambling as to which sperm cell hits the pay load.  Again, I'm curious if these cells are more or less prone to altered methylation.<p>I find this whole concept fascinating! Imagine...your dad gets bullied as a kid, results in altered methylation pattern, and this gets passed to you! Wow.",1319737973

As I was reading this thread, I was just thinking about how other parts of the STEM community aren't nearly so bad.<p>For instance, if you go hang out in your local university's maths (or physics) department, you'll find many of the same conditions. You'll find an overwhelmingly male group, ranging from slightly nerdy to very nerdy, with a sprinkling of a few women. But you won't find these sorts of problems occurring nearly so often.<p>Why? I think it's part of a culture of professionalism vs unprofessionalism, and it's largely age-driven. A university department is dominated (socially if not numerically) by people in their forties and fifties, giving the workplace a much older, quieter, more professional feel than you get in a tech company where just about everybody is in their twenties. It's just a matter of having plenty of adult supervision around, I think.<p>Linux user groups are even worse. They combine the worst features of a party (a lack of professionalism) with the worst features of a high tech workplace (a twenty-to-one sex ratio) so it's not surprising that bad things can happen there.",1319737374

You could even make it a non-profit and save on some taxes.<p>What you want to do is make it impossible for corporations as we know them to exist, taking away freedoms.  Corporations aren't slave-owners and employees aren't slaves.  You have the freedom to work for one or start your own company.<p>I suppose a worker-owned cooperative would be fine, as long as the workers also took on losses (IE: if sales are down this month, you might only get a $500 paycheck as opposed to a $3000 one).<p>Then you would have to deal with the day-to-day stuff and you would end up having a president, treasurer, managers, etc, etc, etc, essentially creating what thousands of years of human history have already told you.  Bitcoin, which was suppose to get around those pesky banks, essentially gave you the reason why banks are necessary: Most people don't want to or don't have the ability to secure their own money.<p>Most people aren't willing to take a risk.

I've been a Mac user since 1985, Cocoa programmer since 2001, got the gold badge on Stack Overflow  believe me, I get it. But I also understand the benefits offered by JetBrains' existing IDE codebase. Engineering always involves tradeoffs. JetBrains' tradeoff may not align with your preference here, but the simple fact is, they now have a highly capable IDE shipping for OS X.  Cocoa doesn't have anything particularly helpful to IDEs that would offset the cost of rewriting, so if they had gone with a total rewrite in Objective-C, it seems most likely that they would either not have <i>anything</i> shipping or they would have a pretty but half-baked product (or both).<p>It's true that not using Cocoa does hurt the product. But there are a lot of ways Cocoa apps can be broken and user-hostile too. The initial release of Xcode 4 was so broken that a lot of people downgraded after trying it for a week. It's still worse than Xcode 3 in terms of stability and responsiveness on average hardware. TextMate has always been Cocoa, but early releases were missing a lot of standard features because so much of the UI was custom code (as the standard Cocoa controls did not offer the functionality TextMate wanted).<p>So yeah, if AppCode were Cocoa, it wouldn't have all the UI problems it does now. It would have different problems. My point is just that which set of problems you'd rather have is a matter of personal preference.

Sure, they're volatile because they're trying to guess how this will ripple out to affects other heavily indebted European economies such as Italy, Spain and so on. But the fact is that nobody knows what size haircut the Greek bondholders are being expected to take, which makes pricing more or less impossible unless one assumes it will be 100% and treats anything less as a windfall.<p>No asset class is completely risk-free, and bonds are no exception. The yield on a bond is meant to be reflective of its risk factor. But in practice, sovereign debt default is rare and the yield so low that buying bonds is equivalent to leaving your money in the bank - a riskier proposition in some countries than others, but an inherently conservative investment all the same. In absolute terms, they're risky, but so is putting your money under the mattress. In relative terms, they're the investment equivalent of the savings account: nobody buys bonds in a politically stable country with the expectation of losing money on the deal, they buy them to keep pace with inflation.",1319735524

Their job was to diversify Mozilla so that it wouldn't depend totally on someone that was making a competing product, and utterly failing at that since multiple years.<p>Last I heard, the IRS was investigating them for claiming deductions as  a charitable foundation but funneling money to the Mozilla Corporation.<p>They've only recently started concentrating on paying developers to reduce the memory leaks, bloat etc after Chrome started eating their lunch in a big way.<p>How is this a poster child for a good way to develop good and useful software for the masses? In fact, it seems to exemplify the pitfalls and weakness in the model, if nothing else.",1319734890

For reasons I can't put my fingers on, nothing seems to irritate nerds more than the idea that <i>they're</i> oppressing people; it probably has something to do with the fact that so many of them were picked on growing up.<p>The reality is that the stuff we're talking about here would, for the most part, be a firing offense at most companies.",1319734869

Starting with the first chapter, where he says 'Abandonment, Special, Chosen' were three words that played a big role in defining Steve's character. And then he goes on to subtly downplay Steve insisting that it actually did not matter.<p>What is wrong with Steve just making intelligent decisions about products, than attributing it to scars from his childhood? Nothing, except that it isn't as interesting.<p>In Dave's article, what I really liked was when he said they weren't really all that special. That is so very true. Real life heroes in the tech industry may not be that heroic. They don't need to be, at least to some of us. Sometimes I feel some of the most successful people in our industry (like Steve, Zuck, BillG) are actually peers, who had somewhat better intuition, better timing, better business sense; they certainly did a few things better. But definitely not beyond the comprehension of some people (though, not me) who comment here.<p>And there are of course people who are actually heroes to me, not merely peers who do a lot better. For example Scott Aaronson, though I understand very little of what he writes.  I just know that even if I had chosen a different path in life, that stuff would still be way beyond me.<p>Don't know if this made any sense. :)",1319734862

Profit""<p>This is just wrong. Even Google had early minor revenue. Revenue traction is king, it's the best kind of traction. User traction is a higher-risk proxy and thus must be more impressive to result in the same valuation after the risk discount.<p>Aside: Wanting to start a lifestyle startup does imply, correctly so, less ambition than the swing-for-the-fencers founders. That's why they're  easy to pick on, ambition makes for much better stories.",1319734857

3164128,comment,3162791,3163942,5,0,ajross,,,"FPGA parts don't model gates, actually.  Their unit is a giant array of SRAM lookup table (two bits wide by 5 address bits I think?) plus some interconnect logic that you can ""wire up"" by setting more bits in other SRAM cells.  They translate this into ""gates"" with some marketing cookery as the number of logic gates that would be required to duplicate the most complicated configuration.<p>So when they say ""20 million gates"", they don't actually mean that any 20M-gate circuit can be built.  It depends on what you're doing; some things (e.g. big logic functions) work better in FPGA logic than others (e.g. complicated wiring and bus architectures).",1319734805

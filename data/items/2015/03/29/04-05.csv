Lost by whom exactly? People found jobs, which otherwise would not exists, and more infrastructure is built.

Make sure that the nameservers only allow AXFR to subsidiary nameservers and that these aren’t allowed to answer AXFR requests.&quot;<p>In BIND, this is configured by the allow-transfer option. You can explicitly allow your slaves with an option like:<p><pre><code>    allow-transfer { 192.168.1.1; };\n</code></pre>\nOr, disable all transfers by specifying &quot;none;&quot;. This can be done on a per-zone basis, as well, though the global section will apply in the absence of zone-specific configuration, which I suspect is how so many servers are misconfigured (i.e. there is no rule in place to block it in the global section, so it is allowing all for zones that don&#x27;t have an allow-transfer section). I just noticed that some of my zones on slave servers fall prey to this, as well, even though I know better. The default seems to be to allow all, if allow-query allows all.<p>That said, I&#x27;m not overly alarmed. Very little (roughly zero) sensitive data exists in my world-facing zones.",1427604867

For passengers themselves and their carry-on baggage, accurate weights aren&#x27;t available so statistical averages are used, based on the number of passengers and their baggage allowances.<p>Airliners do have &quot;squat sensors&quot; in the landing gear, but they&#x27;re not capable of accurately measuring the aircraft&#x27;s weight. They&#x27;re just binary-valued sensors that check whether the gear struts are under stress, to prevent the gear from accidentally being raised while the plane is on the ground.",1427603174

9283846,comment,9283249,9283347,0,0,bzbarsky,,,"The amount universities expect a family to pay for college in the US depends on two numbers: annual income and assets.  A fairly typical formula for the expected family contribution is (income - allowance) * X + assets*Y, where the &quot;allowance&quot; depends on things like size of family, parents&#x27; ages, state of residence, etc, X varies from 22 to 47% depending on the size of (income - allowance) (and in particular there are various brackets in there, with different marginal rates, etc), and Y is generally about 5.7%.  This is all for the parents; student income and assets are treated more harshly.<p>All of which is to say that the college might think you can pay a lot because you have a lot of income, or because you have a lot of assets.<p>What counts as &quot;assets&quot; varies also.  Obviously things like bank accounts and stock investments are included, though retirement accounts are typically excluded.  Home equity for the primary residence is included by many private colleges but not by the FAFSA&#x27;s methodology (which is used by most public colleges, as I understand).<p>So yes, this can be a massive caveat.  Stanford does consider home equity as part of your assets, so if you have a fully paid off house they may effectively assume that you will take out home equity loans or a mortgage on it to help pay for the college education.<p>Of course it&#x27;s not that common for families with income of < 125k who have college-age kids to have a fully paid off expensive house.  So in practice for many people this is not an issue.  But there are absolutely people who are asset-rich and income-poor (think retirees!) for whom the fact that all this stuff is not purely income-based makes a huge difference.",1427602363

Although you would think that by living in the city the individual will save money by expending significantly less natural resources and dramatically lowering his carbon footprint, it ironically costs him less money to do the exact opposite by living in the suburbs. This is because if the individual chooses to live in the city he must pay an extraordinarily high commission in the form of capital gains or rent to land lords. From a financial standpoint living in the suburbs is the only rational choice.<p>This type of counterintuitive behavior only occurs because we live in an era where oil is dirt cheap.

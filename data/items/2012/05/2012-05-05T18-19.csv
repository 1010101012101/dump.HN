3932871,comment,3932492,3932492,6,0,dkrich,,,"I don't think it's a coincidence that the major proponents of doing away with traditional higher education and questioning the value of a college degree are people with at least one degree (in many instances advanced degrees as well) from very prestigious institutions. They believe that in a practical sense, what you really need to know to perform you can gain more efficiently by doing. They ask ""Who knows better than somebody with expensive degrees how worthless they are?""<p>I completely disagree with that and I believe the opposite is true. Only people without degrees can speak reliably about whether they regret the decision or not. They actually put themselves on the line. I'm not convinced when I hear people with degrees say that they wish they had known that they didn't need them before or that they would have been just as well without them. That's like somebody who paid for flood insurance claiming ""who knows better than I how worthless flood insurance is?"" Perhaps the guy down the street who didn't buy it and lost his house.<p>Edit: And to the author's point about iTunes vs buying full albums- that analogy is faulty. There have been community colleges around for many, many years, but the reality is that companies just don't value individual coursework as favorably as an entire degree, particularly one from a prestigious school. The purchaser of a song has very different objectives than a hirer. A song purchaser wants one song and does not want to pay ten times the price to buy an entire album which might have three songs that he likes. Clearly, single purchases are more efficient.<p>But when it comes to hiring, there is no added cost. If I am hiring for a position with a stated salary, I want the most qualified person I can find. If I can hire a guy with three degrees in Computer Science from MIT, I don't really care about the guy with the Microsoft and Cisco certification, even if those are things that are precisely what you need to know on the job. College is absolutely an intelligence test and screening tool, and people are naive to believe that it isn't. If you pull back and decide you are going to turn down MIT and go learn just the skills you need for your job, there are going to be 5,000 people lined up behind you ready to saddle themselves with debt and work through four years of college to get the degree and you will facing an uphill battle. So in the case of iTunes, a comparable situation is if I had $0.99 to spend on a song, and had hundreds of full albums with that song offered for my $0.99. In that case, I am not going to buy the single song.",1336243534

It's always good to write clean efficient CSS but I think articles like this are more like coder porn than anything else. The performance gains are trivial especially when compared to JavaScript, embeds/like buttons, videos, images, and slow database queries. I know DB queries arent rendering related but I know many somewhat experienced developers working on sites that run a CMS who start optimizing everything except their database and drive themselves crazy trying to figure out why pages are loading so slow.

3932850,comment,3929660,3931326,3,0,nirvana,,,"Most valuable piece of info here for App developers: Make your app universal. It doubled our sales.<p>If your thesis is that you'd be better off as an iOS contractor than making your own apps, then you might be right.   But this was our first app, and my partner went from someone interested in design to being an actual designer as part of this experience. I consider that alone to be worth more than $89,250, because it is a multiplier on what we have been able to do subsequently.<p>Also, the first months this app was doing around $200 a month. It took effort on our part to change that.  We have done multiple things that caused the sales of our app to double as a result. In fact, every major release of our app has caused sales to double. In fact, this leads to one of the big secrets of the appstore.  There are 600,000 iPhone apps but only 200,000 iPad apps.  We get equal sales from the iPad as iPhone.  We stared out as iPad only, then added iPhone- boom, sales doubled. (I was hoping for a triple or more because there are so many more iPhones, but alas, no.)  Make a real universal app, you'll do better.<p>I believe there are some things we could do that would double our sales a couple more times-- for instance adding some social aspect to the app, adding iCloud support might both result in a doubling, which would throw your numbers off for the comparison.<p>I didn't put this app out as an example because I think its an example of what one could potentially make-- I put it out there as an example of what could happen if you do an app that never makes it into any of the top lists or gets any marketing.  It was meant as a minimum example, not a maximum example.<p>This app is was also an experiment and has been used as such.  It would have been easy to put out a revision in the last year (and there's a feature we really need to add) but by waiting a year we've observed how not updating the app has affected sales.  Now when we put out the revision we'll be able to confirm our hypothesis about past revisions.<p>I expect this app to continue paying out this dividend for the foreseeable future, which I'd say is about 2 years.<p>This ""dividend"" is completely dependent on the way Apple markets apps to people.  We don't show up on any lists. When Apple changes their algorithm, we feel it, much like google changing their algorithm impacts websites.  So far, Apple has been changing the algorithm to highlight quality apps, and that's a good thing so this has benefited us, but at some point we may run afoul of one of the rules in the algorithm. (the one year without an update was a test to see if there was a rule like that-- and I think there is, I think we've been punished for going so long, but the slack has been taken up by growth in the total addressable market.)<p>With any business effort the question really isn't whether ""apps"" make ""money"", but how much leverage you get.   What makes money is work and smarts, right?   You can spend X amount of time and make Y amount of money a year building a SaaS Website, or building an App or working a job.    Apps give your more leverage than SaaS Websites which give you more leverage than employers-- but that's just a generalization.  It really depends in part on how well you understand the market, but also a great deal on how much effort you put into it.<p>I was pointing out here that we have an app we haven't put much effort into that has made rather good money given the level of effort.",1336243205

For the compiler, when an exception is thrown, the stack is unwound back to the most recent try so the exception handler can be run in the scope of the try.  In order to implement this, the portion of the stack that is unwound would have to be saved somewhere and when the recover is executed, the stack would have to be unwound back to the try again, the saved portion of the stack would have to be ""repushed"" and execution would resume.<p>On the code end, how would the exception code know what failed and what to twiddle to fix things?  The logic associated with the exception code would be extremely complex and tightly coupled to the ""downstream"" code.  It would make much more sense to validate things before performing operations you know might fail to reduce the chances that an exception would occur.

The author therefore doesn't have an as-published electronic copy.<p>To make matters worse, all the big publishers outsourced copy-editing, typesetting, and printing many years ago. The typesetting was probably executed using Quark Publishing System on MacOS by an external agency, who then burned any backups on floppy disk or CDROM. The publishers do not own these, and in fact cannot acquire them without paying the typesetting bureau a three (or four) digit copying fee. So <i>neither the authors nor the publishers</i> own an as-published copy.<p>These days stuff is typeset on Adobe InDesign, which is a whole lot more ePub-friendly, and which can import Quark files ... except that Quark's format is notoriously idiosyncratic and import ops commonly lose some formatting info. (Such as italics, font changes, etc.)<p>TL:DR is that any book published before 2007 or thereabouts may be impossible to republish without either OCR or re-typesetting from scratch.<p>(TeX is pretty much unheard of among authors outside the science fields, and thanks to M$ churning the MS Word file format repeatedly between 1990 and 2008 it may be difficult to do anything with the original manuscript.)<p>Going forward the picture is brighter: I have as-published ebook editions of all my books and know how to crack the DRM on them to pull that text out in a legible form, with formatting intact. (Yes, I appreciate the irony of this. Why, <i>just last week</i> I emailed three DRM-cracked novels I downloaded off BitTorrent to an editor. I wrote 'em, the editor has a license to publish them in the UK, so it's legal, but ... the irony! It burns!)",1336241838

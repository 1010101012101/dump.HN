It irked me to no end that I could jump through all of the hoops and finally get behind the NDA curtain by being hired and then be told ""nope, you can't hear about that"".  That was a severe jolt to the internal culture of the whole company.<p>There had been other projects which had been kept under wraps successfully.  Chrome and V8 were demoed in Seville long before anyone on the outside heard about it.  They said keep it quiet, and we did.  Google TV had been knowable for <i>ages</i> before it went anywhere externally.  There was no reason to think someone would leak Wave.<p>Instead, they started playing the ""we're special and you are not"" card, and that started a sense of resentment growing.  Not even the infrastructure teams which were going to provide services to them were let in on what was really going to happen in there.<p>Then after far too long, demo day of Wave arrived.  I only stayed long enough to see them hit backspace and have it echo out to everyone else who was connected.  I remember my exact comment at the time: ""packets"".  As in, lots and lots and lots of packets flying around to generate RPCs for all of those deltas.  Then those turn into XML or whatever going out to web browser clients, and ... yeah.  SO many packets.  That right there worried me greatly.<p>So then I see this thing about it not scaling properly and choking JVMs and suddenly it all makes sense.<p>Oh well.  All of the secret code depots and restricted access areas must have been practice for what is now happening with Plus.  Entire floors of buildings you can't open as a full-time employee?  Yep.

There is not enough information to deduce the solution, so one must use any available information to infer the most probable solution. We demonstrate that source separation problems are well-suited for the Bayesian approach which provides a natural and logically consistent method by which one can incorporate prior knowledge to estimate the most probable solution given that knowledge.\nWe derive the Bell-Sejnowski ICA algorithm from first principles, i.e. Bayes' Theorem and demonstrate how the Bayesian methodology makes explicit the underlying assumptions. We then further demonstrate the power of the Bayesian approach by deriving two separation algorithms that incorporate additional prior information. One algorithm separates signals that are known a priori to be decorrelated and the other utilizes information about the signal propagation through the medium from the sources to the detectors.<p><a href=""http://knuthlab.rit.albany.edu/papers/knuth-eusipco05-final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://knuthlab.rit.albany.edu/papers/knuth-eusipco05-final....</a><p>Abstract: Source separation problems are ubiquitous in the physical\nsciences; any situation where signals are superimposed calls\nfor source separation to estimate the original signals. In this\ntutorial I will discuss the Bayesian approach to the source\nseparation problem. This approach has a specific advantage\nin that it requires the designer to explicitly describe the signal\nmodel in addition to any other information or assumptions\nthat go into the problem description. This leads naturally to\nthe idea of informed source separation, where the algorithm\ndesign incorporates relevant information about the specific\nproblem. This approach promises to enable researchers to\ndesign their own high-quality algorithms that are specifically\ntailored to the problem at hand.",1318397890

Example: encrypt on the client side, with user-supplied, large, non-compromised keys, and don't ever inspect the data on the server. If you need to inspect data in order to serve relevant ads, do it on the client, and only send back enough information to tailor whatever ads are currently available. Maybe do the ad selection on the client too. If this doesn't work for one of your services, consider it for other services where it would work. Laws prevent you from providing service X without providing such-and-such a hook? Then don't provide service X. Provide a plugin framework instead, and let users bring their own service. Use your heads. Maybe use a bit of the compute power the client has available. You spun down a lot of your China presence because of stuff like this, supposedly.

Insurance premiums are determined by total cost of claims plus expected inflation plus administration costs. There is no ""expected cost"". You are making this term up. There is only risk and the premium mathematically calculated to cover said risk. Making these calculations is the entire purpose of a whole profession: <a href=""http://www.soa.org/about/about-what-is-an-actuary.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.soa.org/about/about-what-is-an-actuary.aspx</a><p>>I referred to the fact that maintaining a pool has costs which the payments must cover in addition to the losses.<p>...which is always significantly less than the losses, since administration fees are usually a percentage of claims.<p>> My risk of having a car accident does not depend on how many people are in ""the pool"".<p>You're failing again to understand the math. The risk of you having a car accident is only part of the equation, the other part is the number of people that are able to absorb said costs. Any artificial group will vary from the mean overall risk, either being better or worse. The larger the pool, the less this variance. This is why you can't get insurance if you get sick: The pool's overall risk is artificially lowered to maintain competitive premiums.<p>>However, subsidies have issues and it is dishonest to claim otherwise and confuse the two.<p>There is no real distinction here except for the doublespeak you're introducing in an attempt to somehow differentiate health insurance from any number of insurance services. Actuaries do not define the term subsidy. It's a political creation to confuse and obscure.",1318397243

Here are the most common:<p>- It was too hard to use / I didn't know what to do with it<p>- It didn't integrate with email / didn't have email notifications<p>- It didn't support IE<p>- I started using it, but none of my friends were using it, so I stopped<p>- It was too slow<p>Too late, the team spent a bunch of time talking to actual users and finding out how they were using the product and what their real pain points were. People use wave to communicate in small teams. IIRC the biggest pain point our users cited was that wave didn't support printing. The people who did get over the adoption hurdle ended up using wave <i>a lot</i>. (I still wonder if maybe wave might have survived if we had charged for it.)<p>Wave died because we were too slow to make it good. The code base consists of around 1M lines of java. With 1M lines of code, you need a giant team to get anything done, and a giant team working hard on features tends to add even more code. The wave team burned too much money too fast. And we were still working too slowly to get explosive user growth. It made lots of people sad, but Google was right to kill wave.<p>If I could go back in time and give advice to the team, I would say:<p>- Don't use Java<p>- Don't scale past a few engineers. You will have a much longer runway that way, and you'll need it if you want to replace email.<p>- The network effect will kill you unless you integrate with email from day 1.<p>- You don't know what you're building, so talk to users early. Like, today.<p>- Don't optimise for scalability until you know what the product is supposed to be<p>- Don't try and reinvent the scrollbar, you idiots. (So much stabbing.)",1318397116

Over the last year or so faced with rapidly rising medical costs in our member population we launched a coordination of benefits(COB) cost management initiative aimed at identifying members who may have other health insurance while covered by us. In the health insurance world Medicaid should ALWAYS be the payer of last resort and if a member has other health insurance Medicaid should never pay the bill.<p>I was able to develop a fairly straightforward two-step utility to 1) identify members who have other health insurance and 2) identify what if any claims our MCO paid for those members. I ran this process across our population and the numbers were staggering... showing tens of millions of dollars that we could potentially recoup...and are now starting to recoup from providers who routed those claims erroneously to us.<p>Given that coordination of benefits (COB) is a core function with significant opportunity  but where there is little automation I decided to launch a start up to drive this as a cost management or profit initiative where technology would play a key role in addressing the problem. My research shows that poorly managed COB function is costing hundreds of millions of dollars across the entire population of insured so the opportunity and ROI to clients would be significant.<p>So I'm basically looking for persons to partner with on this effort - strategic advisors, developers etc. While I have a developer background I have long graduated from coding and my focus is more on strategy and analytics. I know healthcare is not 'sexy' and this is not some shiny new social mashup but it is a big problem and the opportunity is significant.Your feedback is appreciated - it is a bit lonely in the health startup world - and if anyone wants to go deeper with this you can email me at: techy4health@gmail.com.",1318396091

3101579,comment,3099875,3100641,17,0,algoshift,,,"Matt, I think the main problem (having seen what it looks and feels like on the receiving end) is that Google's solution and treatment of the site owner is, for lack of a better term, rather violent.<p>Put yourself in the shoes of someone who is not a scammer and is trying to do a good job.  Perhaps someone how is learning the ropes.  Getting hit with an unilateral, violent and --for all intents and purposes-- permanent action such as seems common in these cases can be devastating.<p>I'd like to relate a case that I witnessed that was truly perplexing.  It involved about 200 domains that were registered with GoDaddy and placed in their ""cash parking"" program.<p>They were there for months with no issues whatsoever.  One day, the domain owner realized that this cash parking service was Google AdSense with GoDaddy taking a bite of the minimal action.  So...he moved all the domains to a product called ""AdSense for Sites"" (I don't remember the exact name).  This services was marketed by Google as a place to park your domains and earn some money through advertising that Google would automagically place on these domains.  Same service that had been on these domains for ages through GoDaddy.<p>The transfer went well and all domains were accepted.  No problems.  The domains go ""live"", if you will, and ads start showing as predicted.<p>Two days later the account is cancelled and the domains are taken off the program citing ""suspicious activity"".  The irony is that the sites --and their content-- were handled entirely by Google through this ""AdSense for Domains"" product.  No self-clicking activity took place whatsoever.  No nefarious activity of any kind.  This person was far too busy with real business to go around clicking on ads across 200 domains to make $0.25 at the end of the day.<p>This was simply a transfer to Google for the same service that Google had been providing through GoDaddy for many months, years in some cases.<p>There was no recourse.  No way to speak to anyone.  No way to even try to understand what this ""suspicious activity"" was all about.  The account was banned, closed, done...forever.<p>Now, here's a person who had plans for legitimate and valuable real sites to be launched on some of these domains later on.  The whole experience scared him to a point of simply rejecting the idea of doing anything with Google if he could avoid it.<p>We had no way to provide any kind of an argument to the contrary because of the violent and totalitarian nature of the cutoff.  Who would want to do business under those conditions?<p>The fact of the matter is that AdWords/AdSense generated revenue could evaporate overnight and with no recourse whatsoever.  That's a tough pill to swallow for anyone who is a legitimate entrepreneur looking to build value and make some money or earn a living through their efforts.<p>Scammers are a different matter.  However, you seem to treat both groups with the same hammer which, in my humble opinion, is not right.<p>I now have to advise anyone we work with that any income that relies on Google for either lead generation or direct income (AdSense) has to be treated as though it could evaporate at any time and for any reason without any real opportunity given to restore it in a timely fashion.  Without that caveat on the table I couldn't personally advise anyone to use your products.<p>In a normal business one would engage with ones vendors in order to resolve issues in mutually beneficial ways. In this case it is a one-way street with violent and severe consequences for your customers and partners.  That's what you have to fix.",1318395983

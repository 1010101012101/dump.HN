4421768,comment,4419030,4419030,2,0,psykotic,,,"Great idea. But as a fast typist of both prose and code I found the interface nearly unusable. Please make it behave more like a normal edit box. I never had any idea of the location of my cursor. The lack of alt-backspace made it unbearably slow to correct errors. Auto-skipping whitespace makes it tougher to rely on my habits where the key strokes for indentation and line breaks are a natural part of the flow. And if you're not going to make me type the comments, just delete them from the text entirely so I can more easily scan ahead.<p>Here's a straight-up bug: I had to turn off a Chrome extension (Type Ahead Find) that I use for incremental search. It was intercepting key strokes that were supposed to go to typing.io. That hasn't happened with Ace and other canvas-based text editors. My friend also mentioned that it didn't work with his Danish keyboard.<p>Beyond these annoyances with the implementation, typing the C code from Redis reinforced how difficult (and frankly infuriating) it is to spontaneously conform to an unfamiliar coding convention. E.g. no spaces in ""while(1)"" throws me off completely because my brain is thinking ""while 1"" and my fingers translate that into my customary ""while (1)"". If you want this web app to be relevant to real-world programming, you need to let people upload their own code samples.<p>For even punctuation heavy, syntactically gnarly prose, I can average 140+ WPM without much effort. Typing.io put me at around 100 WPM for the first few sections of the C Redis lesson. I'd say I'm good for at least another 15-20 WPM if the environment wasn't so utterly alien.",1345719596

But no one knows for sure.<p>> The bit-rate, measured in kbps, is (sampling_rate * bit_depth * channel_count). So for an audio CD, this would be 441000 * 16 * 2 = 1411200 bps = 1411.2 kbps.<p>True.

The price of making novels is going to zero. Music - zero. Flying a jet - zero. Whatever it is that you want - VR can and will do it - and it will begin within this decade.

The world is happy with them. They could learn to SCUBA dive. Heli-ski. Become a wild animal tamer. But they can't sit around in the evenings and create things that change the world in a particular building because it doesn't meet code and therefor might be dangerous.<p>Better than that, they <i>could</i> use the facilities even in a state of disrepair, and they did for a long time. It's only now that it has been inspected that suddenly it becomes dangerous.<p>I think the city has an obligation here to prevent people from getting hurt -- unknowingly. You shouldn't walk into an unsafe building without knowing it. But once you put a big red sign up on the door, as long as there is no danger to surrounding buildings or people, leave the guys alone.<p>To top it off, we have this quote: ""We try to be as supportive as we can...Businesses spin out of there. We are not at all interested in them closing down""<p>Bullshit. This is the classic Nuremberg defense: we're only following the system. Politicians are voted into office to make decisions, and they could have a wavier created in an hour if the right strings were pulled. This is just a matter of hackers not having a strong local political voice. (I do not like the system being broken in a way such that squeaky activists get special treatment, but it is what it is) Hell, the city should be paying itself for the building to be brought up to code. There shouldn't even be a question about it being a problem for the coders to solve on their own. What the hell kind of priorities do they have out there? They have a place successfully spinning off startups and they're fucking around with it? Other cities would kill for something like that.<p>I just find it amazing that the parks and streets in the Bay Area are full of people living a catch-as-catch-can existence. There's rampant drug use, violent crimes, and so on. Perhaps if we were concentrating on public safety and helping the most number of people, instead of working in silos, we would be doing other, more important things?</rant>",1345718961

I used to think my typing speed is just a perk, but everything changed, when I became proficient in TDD and refactoring.<p>Previously I've thought a lot about architecture, code, algorithms, etc. And then typed that in ~1 hour per day. However when I started doing real TDD with running tests every few dozen seconds, everything changed. Now I actualy code almost all the day - play with ideas, throw them away, implement in a multiple ways, refactor a lot. And that is a blessing when you may implement your ideas as fast as you may, so that instead of analyzing the solution, you verify it.<p>Other reason is I've changed my approach to application architecture. Previously I've used the standard PHP/Ruby/JS frameworks and fit my code into predefined places, generated scaffolds, etc. However then I started applying DDD, PoEAA and similar ideas.

Pink has a very popular song called Raise Your Glass, you can listen to it on youtube here: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjVNlG5cZyQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjVNlG5cZyQ</a>. In that song there are many prominent and annoying high-pitched beeps (right in the middle of the chorus even), but I find that most people do not even know they are there, they do not consciously hear them, their brain just filters it out. But once you pick up on it, they become obvious, you can't help but hear them. And the same is true of things like encoding distortion. If you draw the bar at exactly the boundary where people will be able to consciously perceive a difference in quality based on a single listen then you will have placed the bar too low. People will have a slightly lower appreciation for the recordings due to factors they may not even consciously be aware of.",1345717984

This is not Computer Science, this is basic programming and is no better than what you'd get from the numerous video lectures on the web.<p>In short, employable skills are best left to employers, and academic subjects are best left to academia.<p>If it were my choice I'd make Computer Science a purely theoretical course from the outset. If these kids don't have a background in Math give it to them so that they can read through the likes of Introduction to Algorithms and TAOCP with no issue. Don't even let them touch code unless it's to illustrate a theoretical aspect of CS.<p>Once they've got a solid year of CS behind them and they're all of a sufficient standard in the theoretical aspects of CS then they can be introduced to programming. However, I'd steer clear of the employable languages and force them into Python, Lisp, Haskell, Prolog, R and co to reenforce the theoretical background.<p>Of course, you need these graduates to be employable, so why not offer a course titled ""Internship"" during the second year? Let them spend a few days each week working in a real company with real developers that can teach them real skills? I graduated from a modest CS programme and thanks to my numerous internships I was offered interviews left right and centre. I learned more about programming in an eight week internship then I did in an entire year at university, despite most of my second year being about learning to program, and because I had real world experience in employable languages the university didn't cover like C# I walked into a job while others in my class with better grades struggled.<p>You get the idea. Please stop turning academia into a trade school and teach these kids real CS. If you want them to be employable offer a mandatory course where students have to work in a real business and are forced to pick up programming from people that actually know what they are doing.",1345717193

Calf-cow. Not peer-to-peer. That's what I'm keen to get past.</i><p>But the client-server is only <i>for a single request</i>, it's not a static property of a node. You can be both a client and a server simultaneously, making and accepting requests at all times.<p><i>Not sure what you mean here. You need to use HTTP. So you need an http client.</i><p>Yes.<p><i>Chances are you'll be fed heaps of html and other garbage.</i><p>No, HTML is definitively not necessary. Think of what it's commonly called ""Web Services""; they're often only available using structured data encoding formats like JSON and they serve a whole lot of applications that are not web browsers: native mobile apps, for example.<p>HTML is just one of the many formats that can be transported by HTTP, nothing forces anyone to use it in order to use the web.<p><i>Then there's the matter of state. So you're saying HTTP but not in a RESTful way?</i><p>REST doesn't prevent state. It just prevents session/context state from being stored on the server. You can still store it on the client (which, again, would just be one of the roles of a node) and permanent state on both.<p><i>If you're suggesting tunneling everything in HTTP I think that's unnecessary.</i><p>If you mean tunneling as in SOAP, definitively not. I suggesting <i>using</i> HTTP as it's supposed to be used. Something similar would have to be reimplemented anyway, and HTTP is already there and supported by plenty of tools, services, etc.<p><i>Why does it have to be at that layer? Why applications? (...) I want freedom from applications.</i><p>I don't get what you're saying.<p><i>And if I had my way I'd extract the html table parser from it and have that as a standalone filter.<p>The whole ""browser"" concept is outdated. People want to watch video, listen to audio, look at photos and read TEXT. I don't need html to do any of those things. And I don't need html or other HTTP junk to do search to find video. I need a tcp (or other) connection and a video player.</i><p>Again, no HTML is needed. And no, a TCP connection and a video player is definitively not enough. You need some way to identify the video you want to watch, to decide what part of the video you want (e.g. if you already watched the first half), of knowing if that video still exists on the server, possibly some way to authenticate yourself (I don't want to share my personal videos with the world), and it would be nice if the video player could tell what formats it supports so that the server could send it the right version or say that none exists without having to download it.<p>HTTP is well known, ubiquitous, provides all that and it certainly doesn't need HTML for it.",1345716381

It does correlate with race, but I don't think the term (as used in marketing demographics) is racist as I used it -- purely descriptive of the userbase of a site.  Similarly I'd say most BET viewers and fans of Talib Kweli are black AND urban, but that statement isn't racist IMO (although I'm not even sure if it is true; I like Talib Kweli and it is possible that even if a greater percentage of black vs. non black people are fans, the total number of non black fans is higher due to a greater total non black population.)

Both are identified only by their IP and Port pair.
User B does not know of user As intentions.
So user A send switch C an UDP packet asking for ""hole-punching"".
Switch C has this service where users behind NAT routers connect and signup to be contacted when someone wants to ""hole-punch"" to them.
Switch C sends a packet to B with info about A.
B sends A a packet and Bs router is now expecting packets from A. Has soon has A sends its first packet to B its router is open for packets from B. Now both A and B can send packets to each other without C.<p>DNS is not yet entirely out of the loop.

1742662,comment,1741773,1742076,0,0,_delirium,,,"CMUCL, dealing with a similar infinitely-dynamic problem in Lisp, had a similar approach but dealt with it on a block-of-code level instead of per-function. You could declare a block to be compiled together, and any calls between functions in the block would be treated as having a promise that you'd never redef them without recompiling the whole block, so they could be statically optimized with respect to each other.<p>Not sure if that's a better or worse approach overall. It probably depends on the structure of your program. One nice feature was that the same function could be static from some perspectives and not from others--- to functions in the same compilation block it was static, but functions from outside that block that called it treated it as non-static, and would immediately get the new version if, say, that whole block were recompiled. That let you make the core code optimized by sticking it in one big compilation block, while not changing the normal dynamic Lisp semantics of the block when viewed from the perspective of any outside function.",1285835834

You do realize that there are people living in houses in Europe that have existed longer than the US has been a country, right?<p>You do live in disposable houses.  Have you seen how a house in the US is built?  The walls are made of what are called 2""x4""s [1], spaced 1.5' apart.  If you've ever been to Lowes or one of those kinds of places and seen insulation you'll see why.  Insulation comes in big rolls 1.5' wide.  Once the insulation is in sheetrock is put on the inside and blackboard on the outside.  If the home is a brick it will then have bricks laid in front of the blackboard with a strip of plastic in between because of the moisture, otherwise they just put siding on.<p>And that's it.  When I explain this to people in Europe the reaction is always the same.

In fact, for security reasons, it's <i>advisable</i> to not have every device directly on the internet.

Codes dictate building masses and building areas, building lines, requirements for parking, facade design, choise of materials, form of the roof, floor heights etc. etc. Some of those don't cause very much damage since they are useful and most architects would implement them anyways.

Doesn't anybody think they'd be happier with more time off?  Enough so to make it a priority?<p>I tend to take a <i>lot</i> of time off, and one thing I notice when I come back from a trip is how much more productive I feel.  It's like there's all this pent-up brainpower waiting to get out, and none of whatever baggage was clogging it up before I left to get in the way.<p>I used to work 3 month contracts at this one shop, with 6 to 9 month breaks in the middle.  I actually alienated some of the developers there because I'd show up and be 10X - 50X as productive as the next guy (measurable in things delivered), mainly because I was so stoked to be back writing code.  I know that if I'd stayed there an entire year at a stretch, my throughput would have come down to a similar level as the rest of the team.  But because of the way I worked, they'd get 3 months of <i>fast</i>, and then I'd be out the door.<p>I notice the same thing with my own projects when I'm travelling.  If I dip out of internet coverage for a week or so and then get a day to run, it's amazing to see how much I get done in that day.  I imagine that you could get similar results at a regular company by taking 3 or 4 short breaks over the course of the year.",1285834115

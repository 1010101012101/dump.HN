In light of current negotiations with the Islamic Republic I see a lot of parallels between nuclear non-proliferation and the regulation of &quot;weaponized&quot; AI. To wit, even if the entire International System is in agreement about a set of regulations that will do little to stop bad actors. And do I really want inspectors coming to my office to poke around my jump point search code ;)<p>Rather, let&#x27;s take a cue from Nassim Nicholas Taleb and in concert with the progression of AI, develop counter systems that make us less fragile. It shouldn&#x27;t be unreasonable to extrapolate where AI is headed in 1, 5 or even 20 years based upon publicly available research.<p>Which brings up the most crucial point. The subset of humanity that constitutes world-class AI researchers is very finite indeed. Which brings up the significant possibility of a Bane / Dr. Pavel scenario playing out.

So I wanted to show that, embedded in this idea of &#x27;merit&#x27; are a whole bunch of factors that absolutely are talked about by those Pretty People (or, perhaps not them, but the intellectuals from whom their derive their outlook), albeit in different terms. And, modulo that change in terminology, not only do they not stop intellectual discussion, they are absolutely central to that discussion.<p>So, given that was the point I responded to, and what I was trying to say (and, again, sorry if I was unclear). Can you see why being badgered about whether my definition of &#x27;privilege&#x27; is overly broad seemed obtuse? Can you see why I felt that the definition of &#x27;privilege&#x27;, whether tautological, specific or not, was irrelevant?<p>I suspect, in contrast, you tried to read my comment arguing against the entire point you were making, and therefore, trying to support hackeruser&#x27;s argument in some sense. And therefore you missed what I was attempting to get at. Fair enough. Again, I could have been clearer. And I should have thought more carefully about why you seemed to be missing my point. It seemed I&#x27;d hit some nerve just using the word &#x27;privilege&#x27;.",1425337157

In this particular case, I&#x27;d recommend against them since most developers will not be familiar with them, making your API less user friendly.<p>- Using POST:<p>Per RFC 7231, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content, section 4.3.3 [2]: &quot;The POST method requests that the target resource process the representation enclosed in the request according to the resource&#x27;s own specific semantics.&quot;<p>In other words, do whatever you want – such as executing a search query contained within the request body. This is semantically valid, widely supported and common practice. The only downside would be that caching of POST requests is not widely supported, although still possible. The spec even suggests an alternative solution: &quot;Responses to POST requests are only cacheable when they include explicit freshness information (see Section 4.2.1 of RFC7234). However, POST caching is not widely implemented. For cases where an origin server wishes the client to be able to cache the result of a POST in a way that can be reused by a later GET, the origin server MAY send a 200 (OK) response containing the result and a Content-Location header field that has the same value as the POST&#x27;s effective request URI (Section 3.1.4.2).&quot;<p>In other words, you can implement a caching mechanism for your query resource that exposes itself through a URL structure, available for GET requests.<p>[1] <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.1</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.3</a>",1425334777

Going to bed early just increases the chances that this will happen at 2AM and I&#x27;ll be unable to go back to sleep at all, which is worse than waiting until I&#x27;m dead tired at 1AM and going to sleep then (and then still not getting enough, but at least it&#x27;s usually solid).<p>Then my weekend sleep-in day rolls along and I can stay under for 12 hours, falling right back into a deep sleep even if I&#x27;ve had to briefly get out of bed (bathroom), because I know I don&#x27;t have to get up. Unfortunately, I <i>have</i> to have a day like this because my sleep is so bad during the week.<p>I think it&#x27;s related to anxiety about not getting enough sleep, which of course turns into an awful feedback loop.

You can apply for a rebate based on how much you burnt off-road (for example, you have a logging truck that burns 10% of its gas on private logging roads).  If you have an engine that you use exclusively off-road (such as in farm equipment), you can buy whats called pink diesel or dyed diesel.  You don't have to pay the public road use taxes on pink diesel, but it stains your engine.  The engine of a vehicle used on public roads can be inspected to see if its ever burned pink diesel, and if it has, you get in trouble.",1315553551

The station typically has no attendent and no services other than a gas pump, and requires minimum monthly purchases.<p>If you consume more than 50,000 gal/month at a single fleet depot, you'll get a tank and buy the gas by the truckload - the equivalent of what an independent gas station does.<p>If gasoline consumption is a large enough fraction of your total spending, and you're big enough, you'll buy gasoline futures directly from the folks who peddle in them; or buy it directly from the refineries.  You'll have this gasoline delivered to the tanks at your depot.<p>If you need to use a third party's tanks, you'll deliver it directly to their tanks.  For example the FBO (gas station) at my local air port refuels four Sky West/United flights a day, in addition to the occasional private jet and lots of 100LL to the general aviation crowd.  If they put jet fuel in your Citation X, you need to give them a bunch of money, some of which they use to buy more jet fuel.  When they put jet fuel in a SkyWest plane, SkyWest delivers more jet fuel to them and pays a nominal fee for their storage and pumping services.<p>Federal Hours of Service rules limit the UPS drivers to 11 hours of driving a day.  If you assume a UPS truck gets 8 miles/gal and averages 45 mph, then a 75 gallon tank is enough for all day, and they would only need to refuel at the depot.",1315553016

There are of course exceptions with good reasons, but orthography systems are rarely, if ever, good representations of the systems of auditory communication that are formally considered languages.  An orthography system can be heavily influenced by geopolitics (Chinese), have severe ambiguities (Arabic, the various Latin alphabet systems), or have been created retroactively (many languages of indigenous peoples).  While it is convenient to map a spoken language to its related orthography when discussing topics such as syllables, inflection, and morphology, it is rarely appropriate when studying linguistics formally.<p>As for Japanese, while it is true that its alphabet system has a relatively straightforward mapping to its phonology, the mapping itself is, unfortunately, not unambiguous.  Japanese has a tonal system[1] that is not explicit in its orthography. There are examples of phonemically distinct words that are identical when written in hiragana/katakana.<p>Finally, there exists a moraic system[2] which sits between the phonemic and syllabic abstractions. Japanese, especially, have many phenomenons that cannot be adequately modelled unless working in this in-between system.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_pitch_accent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_pitch_accent</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mora_%28linguistics%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mora_%28linguistics%29</a>",1315552897

The tones just aren't that important - Chinese speakers can generally guess the meaning, though they will think you sound like a 4-year-old if you don't pronounce tones correctly. IMO, getting the vowels and consonants right is harder (and more important).<p>Seriously, here's the pairs you will confuse:<p>d / t - d is unaspirated<p>j / zh -  j is a ""cjsch"" sound (a bit like ""A<i>s</i>ia"") while zh is a ""j"" sound<p>q / ch - q is a ""bright"" (slightly whistled?) ch; ch is a ""dark"" ch)<p>x / sh - x is a ""bright"" sh and sh is a ""dark"" sh<p>c / s -  c is a ""ts"", s is just s<p>b / p - b can sound a little closer to p than in English and p is more aspirated<p>g / k - g sounds a little close to k, while k is more aspirated<p>Then there's the vowels, which are really hard. Learning four tones is comparatively easy.<p>If you don't get the consonants almost 100% correct, people will simply not be able to tell what you are saying. If you don't use tones, they can usually understand, as long as you use simple words (which face it, you will).",1315551684

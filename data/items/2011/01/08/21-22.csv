None of these are equivalent statements about a field in general (even if they're all true here).<p>Still, it seems like in fact <i>saying things about</i> ""programming"" might also being inherently hard!<p>I mean, we can say that the halting problem is inherently but the halting problem doesn't reflect the day-to-day practices of the working programmer. Yet how do we characterize what does? The boundary between programming and using computers is fuzzy and given Church-Turing, just about defined activity can be encompassed in using a computer (a lot of machinists have become ""programmers"" of numerically controlled machines but this use is more similar to artists using Photoshop than software engineers using c++). One might argue that the advance of computer technology will create more and more professions which involve the high-level use of computers but won't be ""programming as such"" (spread-sheet use, UI design, etc).<p>By that token, if ""real programming"" is what's left when you've codified the other occupations, one could argue that it is inherently hard. But we're still a bit at the level of tautology.",1294523798

It's really a lot like (code) reading, testing, debugging and maintenance--all key programming skills.<p>An automotive engineer will actually a design a car, design and various components, model how it should work and so on. This is really program design and <i>programming</i> specifically.<p>The thing about programming is that involve perhaps the most tractable medium humans have ever used. It takes a long time to design and build a car. It still takes a long time to make significant changes to that car. Now compare that to software, which is easily changeable with a feedback loop that can be measured in as little as a few seconds (edit code, save, reload page in browser).<p>Of course some software has a longer feedback loop but at worst it tends to be in hours, possibly days. It's a different order of magnitude.<p>Cars can be adjusted within fairly tight limits (meaning you can make the engine more efficient or make the brakes work better or not at all but you can't easily make that car float or fly).<p>Is programming harder than being a mechanic and/or automotive engineer? Empirically I can't answer that question. I would be useless as a mechanic. Could I learn? Possibly. Would I be as good as those with a natural affinity? Absolutely not.<p>One thing I'll add is that the barrier to entry for programming is probably higher but this might simply be an issue of complexity.<p>Consider a car from 40-50 years ago. It wasn't that complicated. Now? Cars have <i>dozens</i> of computing units in them and qualified mechanics have to use computer systems to interface with them. So perhaps modern software is more like a modern car than a car from the 70s.<p>Now consider another discipline like medicine. Is medicine hard? It certainly requires a lot of knowledge. Part of many medical disciplines it appears involve a significant amount of rote learning. Bone names, nerves, diseases and so on.<p>Some have an affinity for rote learning and some don't. I know I don't.<p>The other part of medicine is the mental attitude required. Not everyone is psychologically capable of dealing with a patient who is dying or has the mental endurance to perform a 12 hour heart transplant. It's very <i>exact</i>.<p>But is it harder?<p>My own theory is that some people can become programmers and others can't. Some of the ones who can't sadly are employed as programmers.<p>Programming requires an extremely high level of abstract thought. I remember demonstrating to my sister how I used Splashtop on my iPad to connect to my PC at home to start it doing something. To her, it was for all intents and purposes magic (to paraphrase one of Arthur C. Clarke's laws).<p>To me--and anyone reading this--there's nothing magical about it. It's simply a system of concepts built on top of other concepts.<p>This also changes my thinking. I see (human) language much like a network protocol. Letters are merely agreed-upon symbols that, when combined, form sounds (most) humans are capable of making. Combine those sounds (or groups of letters) into words and you have a another layer of agreed-upon concepts (or definitions).<p>Network protocols work much the same way. Ultimately there is a physical layer where certain voltage differences equate to 1s and 0s. Once you have the concepts of transmitting bits, you arrange them into bytes. Certain bytes or byte sequences resolve to characters. Combine those characters and you have a message.<p>It's systems built on systems. Do non-programmers see language that way? Unless they're linguists, probably not.<p>So I guess my point is that programming (or anything for that matter) may simply look hard because the foundation in concepts simply isn't there. Whether or not someone can learn those concepts and whether or not that makes programming qualitatively hard is another matter.",1294520401

Instead, a huge sensor captures many more pixels than you need, and then software algorithms distil this down to a five-megapixel image of great richness and detail.<p>The sensor is 41 megapixels, creating as a first step a 34 megapixel image; the other pixels being put to good use interpolating the image. For a technical explanation, see [1]. The phone actually keeps a master copy of the image at full resolution, and presents the five-megapixel image to you right away for editing and sharing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/07/15/nokia_lumia_1020_technical_walkthrough/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/07/15/nokia_lumia_1020_tec...</a>",1380614365

Now, it may be possible that some people would say &quot;we won&#x27;t work if we don&#x27;t know we&#x27;d be paid in time&quot; - but they don&#x27;t know that either way, and their salary probably is not contingent on specific work.<p>Same with cloud hosting and any other expense - I have hard time believing it is billed hourly.

The work often involves understanding computer architecture, registers, memory and IO. Everything cool (read: advanced OS concepts) that you learn in college is getting implemented there.<p>Some job profiles include programming GPUs, device drivers for a new device, writing kernel code for the processor, firmware for other chips on a motherboard.<p>There are also math intensive jobs such as 3d spatial programming for manufacturing simulation and nanoscale image processing for finding defects in wafers.<p>Compiler and language enthusiasts often enjoy working in the forefront. When Intel plans to come out with a new instruction set, it uses its own engineers to write an optimized compiler (better than gcc) for those instructions.<p>Same goes for Java in Oracle.",1380611085

It doesn't call by name alone.  It can thus be passed to a function (a callback for example), saved to a variable, etc for later calling.  Maybe not so useful for the exit function in the interactive shell but very useful for functional programming.  This is an example of consistency, sometimes at the expense of convenience; not great for hacking, awesome for collaboration and large projects (imo).<p>>>> dir(exit)<p>['__call__', '__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__doc__', '__getattribute__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__module__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__str__', '__weakref__', 'name']<p>(pardon the dunderware)<p>Here's another way to exit the interactive shell ;)<p>>>> exit.__call__()",1243663117
633310,comment,632724,633059,0,0,brl,,,"I think that plenty of people feel confident rolling RSA or DH into a protocol design precisely because they <i>do</i> understand the math.  The structure of both algorithms is very simple (In the case of DH maybe even trivial), but if you don't understand dozens of (not-very-obvious) attacks against both algorithms you're never going to be able to use them or implement them correctly.",1243663086

633298,comment,633179,633274,0,0,brandonkm,,,"I highly disagree.  To argue that articles like this have a macro effect on the economy (short term) is categorically false.  If we want to focus on economic recovery as a function of consumer spending then we really can't zero in on a strong correlation between magazine articles and how the public feels about the economy without the data to back that up.<p>Furthermore, it is absolutely essential that everyone learns more about the current recession and are realistic about a recovery.<p><a href=""http://baselinescenario.com/2009/05/25/recession-and-recovery-how-long/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://baselinescenario.com/2009/05/25/recession-and-recover...</a><p>I would in fact argue that economic education for the public helps the economy, because if more people are educated on the many factors that contributed to the current recession (negative U.S. savings rate being one major one) then they now have the knowledge to change their actions.  On a wide scale (larger percentage of people saving more) this would have a net positive effect on the economy.",1243662302

I am sure the developers appreciate when their program fails to compile because the compiler statically notices a bug that would cause a runtime error in a more dynamic language.

Because, as lame as C's typechecking is, this remark sounds to me a lot like the ""no true Scotsman"" fallacy.<p>The sort of testing that the SQLite developers do is, while depressingly uncommon, not that unreasonable for any sort of software been around for a few years.

It is not the best situation, but if you have no better offers then why not do it. In the long run the only way to ""fix this problem"" is to get enough skills that you can easily get real jobs or start your own venture. And this internship sounds like it could help.",1243660043

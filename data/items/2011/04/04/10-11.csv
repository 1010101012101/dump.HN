2406039,comment,2403696,2405993,1,0,gnosis,,,"This reminds me of how Slashdot allows unregistered users to post under the monicker ""Anonymous Coward"" (AC), and by default gives all such posts a score of 0, while the posts of registered users start off with a score of 1.<p>Combined with Slashdot's default filtering (only comments highly rated comments are visible by default) and the huge flood of comments that popular stories get, very few people ever read the posts of AC's.<p>I've never had a Slashdot account myself, and have always posted anonymously.  I haven't posted a lot, but I feel the posts I did make were all carefully considered, polite, and contributed to the discussion.  But, because of Slashdot's discrimination against anonymous comments, they were rarely upvoted (and therefore rarely read by most users, who have thier comment filters set to only read higher rated comments).<p>Which is kind of sad, when you consider some of the utter garbage that gets upvoted there all the time, and considering that every comment (no matter how awful) made by a registered user starts off with a higher score by default.<p>Now that's not to say that Slashdot doesn't have good reason to rate anonymous comments lower than the comments of registered users.  There are plenty of anonymous trolls of Slashdot, and that's one way of dealing with them.<p>That's also not to say that on HN, giving lower default ratings to pseudonymous comments than to comments left by authenticated users would necessarily be a bad thing.<p>But it should be noted that there are many high quality pseudonymous comments on HN right now (as only a relatively small minority of people use their real names here), and I'm not so sure how the HN community would react if the people who've revealed their names started to dominate the discussions, or if the comments by pseudonymous users were penalized by default.<p>I suppose that as long as pseudonymous posts weren't censored (as AC posts effectively are through the filtering mechanism on Slashdot), then it wouldn't be so bad.  But I have a feeling that such filtering (and effective censorship) will inevitably come to HN sooner or later.  And then pseudonymous users would become even more second-class citizens.  And to that I'd really have to be opposed.<p>There are better ways of dealing with the decline in comment quality than penalizing pseudonymity.",1301914198

2406031,comment,2405364,2405774,2,0,chad_oliver,,,"I did a quick google search for ""the usual arguments"", and as far as I can see it boils down to three objections: loss of control, governments becoming out-of-touch with their populations, and having a single point of failure.<p>In regards to the single point of failure, I've got no real answer except that governments have scaled well so far. However, this answer doesn't deal with the fact that so far we've always had other governments to compare ourselves to, which keeps the population in a healthy state of mild envy.<p>Loss of control is a big issue, and not one that's going to go away any time soon. To take the extreme case, there is basically zero chance that any country currently under sharia law will adopt this form of government, because it gives human science the right to veto Mohammad's commands. Likewise, any attempt to join Canada and the USA will suffer from dissidents who don't like to give up their national character.<p>It is inevitable that large governments will be less attentive to the needs of individual communities, but not to the degree that it is often expected. The simple fact that 200 million + people can have one president indicates that social stability is more important that actually being able to make an impact on the people who rule the country.<p>I don't really feel like I've given a very good answer to your question. Perhaps the only route to world government is to start with a small country, demonstrate that it works better than the current forms of democracy, and aggressively support national revolutions during times of world turmoil. Because the fourth branch of government is based on independently verifiable science, it wouldn't be too difficult to set up an international confederation of government science. The social laws of different countries would tend to converge simply because everyone would be working from the same data and the same conclusions, and hopefully after fifty years or so the international confederation would collude to vote through policies of non-aggression in their respective countries.<p>So, yeah, the linchpin in the system - the property that allows it to work across national borders - is that government policies would be able to be verified and tested using internationally-standard science.",1301913932

No doubts the way his business has grown is actually a story of how determination and simplicity in an established industry can lead to great businesses.<p>However, using a blanket statement to characterise the potential of a startup might not be the best way forward. From what the author says, it would be impossible to see Twitter, Foursquare, Square ever be born. I for one would not be happy if they did not exist.<p>Just because one has never seen an idea getting successful might not always mean it is impossible. It often means no one has tried hard enough. I know the pragmatists would thrash me by saying the contrary.<p>The truth is that there are many ways to go about founding a company. One is to actually set off to found one because to you the joy of founding and working for yourself while solving a real pain is what is of prime importance. The idea or the sector you are in might not be the closest thing to your heart. (Though it must not be too distant too). This is the way that Paras speaks of and for most of the folks it is great.<p>Another way is to just work on something that solves a real problem for you. It might be just a simple app that tells you all the cool places in a city maybe just your city but something that you want to do and feel there is a real need for. A point to be noted is that by now you have not thought of how it will make money or how the server bills will be paid. Well do not worry you are not the first person to go this way nor the last one.<p>The other route is to just come up with a crazy idea that everyone who hears has just one thing to say: ""Why won't I use this with that or why do I need that"". Don't worry if others cannot see what you clearly see. In such a case the final product is already  in your head and you can see hundreds of uses for this. Every day you refine it in your head till the reality and vision of the product converge. Chances are that if you actually stayed around to see them converge then you have something going on for you. Either you actually believe in the product and it is a great product that the world did not see the need for till they started using it OR you were just being delusional. I would say the chances of being delusional if you stuck around till a final MVP are not very high.<p>Each of the above 3 paths are for different types of people.

I'd imagine there are also several optimizations that can be done (leveraging multi-core chips or GPUs, for instance) to make the performance significantly better than the prototype he's demonstrating now. Also, taking into account Moore's Law, we may not be able to run this on today's mobile devices, but surely could on tomorrow's. Given that research is generally a few years ahead of industry, I would expect that, by the time this would come to market, the devices will be more than capable.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/Z.Kalal/tld.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/Z.Kalal/tld.html</a>",1301912700

The easy answer is that the people at SB Nation share my vision of what publishing looks like in the year 2011. They think that the technology used to create and distribute news on the web (and mobile) is as important as the people who are responsible for the content itself. And thats not just pillow talk  SB Nation is actively evolving its tools and processes to meet the growing and changing needs of its vast editorial teams and their audience communities. Theyre building for the web as it is now. From the perspective of a journalist who also happens to be a huge nerd, thats a match made in heaven. SBN isnt just another media company pushing news out  its a testbed and lab for some of the newest and most interesting publishing tools Ive ever seen. In short, I was blown away when I saw what kind of technology theyre using to get news on their front page and engage audiences, and even more blown away when I started talking to them about what could come next.""</i>",1301912282

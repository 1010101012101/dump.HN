You can grow quite a bit with simple caching and monolithic database scaling before having to tackle more complex distributed data architectures.",1255129161
872640,comment,872640,872437,0,0,joevandyk,,,"The 16 worker processes only handle dynamic requests, not static.  With proper http caching, ESI, etc, it's quite likely that amount amount of concurrency is more than enough for their needs.<p>Say that when all the workers are being utilized, the average dynamic request takes 50ms (which is on the high end).  That means that each box can handle 320 dynamic requests per second. Which is a decent amount, and I'd be surprised if they see that much traffic.<p>If they are using http caching and ESI properly, the average request time would be significantly lower, and the requests per second would probably be > 500/s on that box.",1255129117

I suspect there hardly an (if any) writes happening when you hit /users, the database is repeatedly fetching a hot query (or you are pulling from a cache that isn't changing because there are no writes happening), your dataset could be minimal, etc.",1255129019
872638,comment,872283,872605,0,0,mrshoe,,,"Sure, now that HN has decided that enough time has elapsed to allow me to reply. :-)<p>Actually, antonovka did an excellent job explaining it above. The most important aspect is that threads are ""lighter weight"" than processes. They use less memory and are quicker to context switch (usually). The result of this lighter weight is that you can spawn more threads than you could processes, on the same hardware. And when you're using one thread/process per connection, that means more concurrent connections on the same hardware. So, if Unicorn used its exact same architecture, but replaced the worker processes with worker threads, you could scale much better.<p>Secondly, haproxy is written in C, which generally means it's going to perform much better and use <i>a lot</i> less memory than a Ruby webserver. This translates, once again, to more output from the same amount of hardware.<p>That's why I was pretty surprised to see that github would choose both Ruby and pre-fork over C and threads (or in the case of haproxy, async, which scales even better).",1255128866

That being said, I don't believe your proposal is a fair comparison.<p>Of course, using Java on bare metal is going to have more performance/$ than ruby on Xen.  That's not the point.  The point is to use tools that maximize human capital at the expense of server costs.<p>I don't know what you mean by reducing moving parts.  The only parts involved in handling the requests for this setup are Nginx and HAProxy.  All the other technology parts (Tokyo Cabinet, memcached, Sphinx) are used to scale the database, something your stack still has to achieve.<p>The tradeoffs between using bare metal vs virtualization and using Rails vs Java are well known at this point.   Recommending a NASCAR driver to use a Formula 1 car isn't helpful advice.",1255126350

This includes all major video cards (very recent ATI 4850 and nVidia 9xxx, as well as older Intel onboard, ATI 3200 onboard), and both 32 and 64 bit builds of Flash.  I'll give the desktop player a try, but I'm not holding out hope of being able to use it for actual big screen viewing.  I sometimes watch shows in a window while working, and that works fine on all of my Linux boxes.  But full screen remains useless.",1255126265

872572,comment,872276,872475,0,0,jules,,,"As someone who is forced to do LabView programming to set up experiments in a class, I disagree. LabView is the most unproductive way to code ever. Doing an `if(x<y)` takes like 100 clicks. The reason LabView is acceptable is that it has a lot of libraries for interfacing with hardware, and libraries for displaying measurements (but if I right click on an array view then ""copy data"" it copies the number as an image (!) instead of the underlying array, WTF?).",1255126191
872571,comment,872513,872513,0,0,ApolloRising,,,"I did this recently. What i did was just get them a macbook pro 15 inches (easier to see the larger screen). Increase the default font sizes until they are comfortable. Setup USB based speakers into a hub and plug as much as you can into that one hub so there is only ONE cable connection other than power that they need to remember to connect the laptop once it is on the desk. I then labeled that end with one of those small labeling machines so they don't get confused. Using a weirdly colored usb cable also helps, so you can say did you plug in the RED one over the phone?<p>Wireless setup as easy as it is on the mac was done by me to make sure they are secure. Make sure to configure the guest account if you get the more expensive airport router extreme, this way they can allow anyone to surf without having to open up the entire network.<p>They were setup on a gmail account that tied into the standard apple Mail software via IMAP so that they can check their mail from anywhere.<p>Their small digital camera was setup to import into Iphoto and they seemed to really like that. I removed any icons from the desktop and dock that they did not use. So basically they have finder, safari, mail, iphoto, ical, itunes, and chat.<p>I advised them not to use personal finance software on this thing due to their lack of experience with it. They prefer paper statements and going into the bank. Some of the spam emails look so authentic that they might get confused and make a mistake if I tried to have them start using online banking.<p>I also installed logmein software (they have a free version) that allows you to show them remotely how to do certain things and they seem to appreciate that quite a bit.<p>Backups are done via superduper, I am still considering an online backup service for them but have not gotten around to that just yet.<p>Games to occupy the grandchildren were also added so they can enjoy that with the kids. Adding a remote wireless apple keyboard is probably going to be a good idea since the kids tend to bang on things they should not.<p>Importing their music into Itunes also made them happy.<p>Behind the scenes with their permission you can also probably setup an automated rsync or rsnapshot to a remote server.",1255126184

We need fewer of them, not more, and any CA that can give certificates away for free is guaranteed to have atrocious practices.<p>It appears that this company authenticates you by verifying that you can receive email at the domain that you want the certificate for.  In addition to completely defeating the purpose of SSL by sending secrets in the clear over SMTP, ability to receive email at a certain address is no proof of ownership of that domain.  Unfortunately, though, StartCom didn't invent this stupidity.  I already discovered a few months ago that I can get Thawte to issue me an SSL certificate for hushmail.com.",1255125675

The web was not originally designed to be an application platform, it moved that way because business pushed it in that direction. I know the vast majority of sites I visit don&#x27;t use cookies or javascript for anything important, because I have both of those turned off by default anyway. It seems very obvious that the majority of cookies and javascript these days are being used for tracking purposes, i.e. things that don&#x27;t benefit the user in any way and should probably be blocked for practical purposes.<p>>Being overly paranoid hurts innovation and limits what we can do.<p>This statement is also ridiculous. Being concerned about your own privacy isn&#x27;t paranoia, it&#x27;s self-preservation. We have all the reason to expect these companies to think twice before going forward with some innovation that could be potentially harmful, but it appears you want to encourage them not to do that. What you&#x27;re actually saying is &quot;companies having to worry about ethical issues limits what we can do,&quot; which is absolutely true, and this is not a negative thing.<p>To me the reality of this technology is more Idiocracy than anything. The marketing hype is that it&#x27;s somehow a futuristic sci-fi fantasy device. It&#x27;s just another way to sit on the couch watching TV and playing games.",1383937168

6698245,comment,6697388,6697388,1,0,quchen,,,"(I posted this same answer in the r/Haskell crosspost, I think it may be useful here as well.)<p>I&#x27;m the &quot;David&quot; the article talks about. The backstory is this:<p>I spent a year abroad, but we were regularly talking over XMPP. One day, Dobi gave me a link to an online book that has a sun saying &quot;holy shit&quot; on the front page. It was <a href=""http://learnyouahaskell.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnyouahaskell.com/</a>, and it spoke of some obscure language I had never heard of. But I found the pictures funny so I started reading the first chapter.<p>A month later, Dobi had long lost interest in Haskell himself, but I was hooked. Every &quot;wow FP is awesome moment&quot; was forcibly shared with him. I soon began to talk about ApplicativeMonoidMonadFunctor and how neat these abstractions are.<p>Since that one day when I received the LYAH link, it&#x27;s marked &quot;Dobi shows David Haskell day&quot; in my calendar, this has continued: I&#x27;m learning Haskell, and everything cool is thrown at Dobi. He even made a second attempt at learning Haskell, but due to its inaccessibility (relative to Elm), he lost interest again.<p>Then, a couple of weeks ago, he asks me whether I knew Elm. I said yes, but as someone who now uses Haskell as his main language, I thought of Elm as a toy. Today I see how this was wrong: Elm is an excellent language, maybe not to write a scalable webserver, but it gets a few things right that Haskell doesn&#x27;t:<p>- Elm is very accessible.<p>- Even simple and small programs can have cool output, and by that I don&#x27;t mean conceptually cool but you-can-show-your-friends cool. Getting positive feedback is really motivating in the beginning when you&#x27;re not quite sure whether the language is useful yet.<p>- Elm has Haskell-like syntax, and is of similar semantic structure. It has recursive lists, fold, map, Maybe and all those other Haskell Prelude things.<p>- No category-like abstractions (as a result of not having typeclasses, mostly). Monads are pretty abstract, and are pretty infamous among people that don&#x27;t know them. This significantly lowers the barrier of entry.<p>The crucial thing is the similarity to Haskell: Elm is a much better gateway drug to Haskell-like languages than say XMonad (which is pretty geeky) or other nice little things. Once you can write Elm, a Monad is just another addition to a language you already know how to move in, and you can learn to include it in your programming instead of requiring it in the first place. I think instead of having a &quot;beginner-friendly monomorphic Prelude&quot; we should have generalized the crap out of Prelude (Foldable, Traversable, all those things go in) and recommended Elm to newcomers if they have problems with Haskell.",1383936575

6698236,comment,6697416,6697416,42,0,ssharp,,,"Having been of a few cruises, I&#x27;d like to point out a few things:<p>1) Listed prices generally DO NOT include gratuities. Low level cruise employees like the cleaning crew, cabin stewards, waiters, cooks, etc. are paid ridiculously low wages, because cruise ships are registered to countries like Panama and the companies do not need to adhere to U.S. standards. I don&#x27;t recall offhand, but for a 7-day cruise the &quot;automatic&quot; gratuity is, I believe, around $100 or so per person, so take that into consideration. You can remove the charge if you want to, but you&#x27;d have to be a pretty big asshole to do that :) Also, prices are based on double-occupancy, so if you go by yourself, double the fares.<p>2) Internet is expensive, slow, and charges by the minute). However, if you do this a lot, some cruise loyalty programs will give you free internet. I know Princess does this. Also, you&#x27;re cell phone my work in certain locations. I&#x27;m a U.S. AT&T subscriber and I have full service in U.S. ports like San Juan and the U.S. Virgin Islands. If you can tether your phone, you&#x27;ll get much faster and cheaper service that way than on the boat internet.<p>3) Don&#x27;t get sick / injured. My wife stepped on broken glass while wearing open-toed shoes and got cut up pretty bad. The doctor on board used strips instead of stitches, and the cut reopened in two days, by which time we were already off the ship. The crew handled the incident terribly. The problem with the glass was not resolved quickly, my wife had to wait a fair amount of time for someone to show up with a wheelchair to take her to the doctor and the crew went into &quot;don&#x27;t get sued&quot; mode really quickly. They gave us pushback when we refused to sign a liability waiver before getting treatment and we had some security guy who kept insisting to come into our room to photograph the shoes my wife was wearing at the time. When we complained the next day about the process, a nice woman sat down with us to hear out our complaint, but never really did anything. We were adamant about NOT paying for the care and it never showed up on our bill, so we let well enough alone. Three months later, they sent us a bill for $300 for the care. After we sent their HQ a letter in response, they ended up waiving the fee and giving us $100 credit towards our next cruise. Nice, but it was ridiculous in the first place since.<p>4) In regards to the above, had something worse happened, or they had refused to waive the fee, good luck fighting the cruise company in court. You&#x27;re not only bound by typical consumer-crushing stuff like forced arbitration, but you&#x27;re also getting into international legal difficulties. For big cases like the cruise that tipped over, it&#x27;s worth the hassle, but for smaller claims, you&#x27;re pretty limited in what you can realistically do.<p>All that said, I think this is a pretty cool idea and had always thought about how cruises could be a cool little work/vacation thing.",1383936497

Being new in my entrepreneurial career I&#x27;m just learning the pleasures of working from anywhere.<p>I live in San Diego, but a few weeks ago I drove up to NorCal to visit the parents.  While there I attended Startup School in the bay area.  The next week I flew to Boston and stayed with a friend in Cambridge and attended WordCamp Boston.  I attended the Business of Software conference next and stayed at the Seaport Hotel.  At the end of the conference I took the short ride to Cape Cod and stayed there for a week or so with some family.  It was a little chilly this time of year, but with everyone gone during the day and the tourist season over I could really enjoy the beauty and eat at all of the great restaurants.  It&#x27;s incredibly peaceful.  I even spent some time at the Chatham Bars Inn and worked from there...absolutely incredible.<p>By staying with friends and family and managing costs the whole few weeks probably cost around $1,000 including plane tickets.  The most expensive thing was the three nights at the Seaport Hotel, which cost around $500 even though I split the room with someone.  It would have been a lot more if my wife was with me since we would have wanted to do more.<p>So now I&#x27;m back in NorCal staying with my parents.  I&#x27;ll probably stay here through Thanksgiving then head back home to San Diego for the winter.<p>This lifestyle really is incredible.

6698175,comment,6697416,6697416,15,0,mjn,,,"One of the academic conferences in my field has been on a cruise on and off [1], for some of these reasons. One of the main things people like about it is that it keeps everyone together: everyone eats in the same dining room, drinks at the same bars, and it&#x27;s easy to meet up and split off into impromptu discussing/working groups somewhere. Whereas in a big city people tend to diffuse, partly by income (well-paid people go to different restaurants than grad students), partly by interest, partly by what part of the city they found a hotel in. Many people also like no-internet. No temptation to respond to work emails or check Facebook during talks! And finally, it means everyone <i>has</i> to come for the whole conference or none of it: no showing up for half the conference, or just for your keynote.<p>The cost is also surprisingly low, typically coming out less in total than a typical &quot;big hotel&quot; conference does: when you add up conference-room rental, catering for coffee breaks and lunch, cost of hotel rooms, restaurants for dinner, etc., the cruise ship&#x27;s all-in group pricing typically ends up cheaper per person, sometimes substantially so.<p>The downsides:<p>1. It looks bad externally, like academics wasting taxpayer money on a boondoggle. Even if it&#x27;s cheaper, the image is too luxurious. It looks better to have a conference at a Marriott in Chicago, <i>even if</i> that costs the taxpayers more. It looks bad enough that some people won&#x27;t come, because their source of funds won&#x27;t approve the trip.<p>2. Flipside of the community tightness aspect is that it can feel claustrophobic to be essentially stuck at the conference, literally unable to leave the floating conference hotel.<p>3. No internet means certain kinds of demos won&#x27;t work, or need added preparation. Although this is good practice anyway, because conference-room internet is often flaky even on land.<p>4. Not being able to come for only part of the conference can also be a disadvantage, since the schedule is inflexible. If you have a hard conflict anywhere in the conference, you have to skip it, since there is no way to arrive half a day late, or leave even 2 hours early.<p>Last year we experimented with having it in a medium-sized town with a compact city center, in a lower-cost-of-living location [2], to try to get some of the advantages without the disadvantages. I think this worked fairly well, and I personally liked it more than the cruise ship. But there is an added travel disadvantage, because there are few compact towns that also have good international airports.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.fdg2014.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fdg2014.org/</a><p>[2] Chania, Crete: <a href=""http://www.fdg2013.org/attendees/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fdg2013.org/attendees/</a>",1383936082

Because of this, the developers (and their companies) do not mind paying a few thousand dollars for a new piece of software.  Anything the developer creates is often only useful for competitors to one&#x27;s product, so there is very little incentive to share.<p>><i>I&#x27;ve gotten to the point where I can have their &#x27;demo lesson&#x27; running in a fully open toolchain faster than they can get the rest of the attendees windows and custom package install issues sorted out.</i><p>If you spend a year working on developing an entirely new hardware & firmware product, you see that importing new files, finding libraries, and adapting software from one IDE to another is not a very important or time consuming part of the project.  When you spend a few weeks discovering that there are undocumented hardware glitches in the integrated circuit, that the errata is inaccurate, or that you own hardware behaves unexpectedly, the IDE is of little consequence.<p>><i>I&#x27;ve been supporting efforts like the libopencm3 desire to build an open and common ARM support library, but more of that needs to happen to build in some good practices for these embedded developers to learn from.</i><p>As an embedded developer, the open ARM library is of little interest to me.

That is, there is <i>absolutely no link</i> between loans and reserves in the rules (laws and regulations).<p>As long as the amount of reserves is close to the legally required minimum amount, there is an indirect link between loans and reserves, but its causality goes in the other direction as traditionally believed. When the volume of loans increase, then deposits increase also. Then the banking system as a whole needs more reserves.<p>If the amount of reserves available were fixed, this would lead to banks bidding up the overnight interbank interest rate. However, after some disastrous experiments in the 1970s and 80s with alternative policies, central bank policy is to keep that interest rate fixed. And that means: the central bank accommodates the banks&#x27; desire for more reserves by buying assets from the banking system.<p>Conversely, banks bid down the overnight interbank interest rate towards zero if there are too many reserves in the system, unless the central bank pays interest on reserves. This is exactly what central banks in most of the Western world want to happen today.<p>In any case, the story is that the amount of loans made by banks causally sets a lower bound on the amount of reserves in the system. The reverse direction does <i>not</i> hold.<p>Again, anybody who believes the latter would have to exhibit an explicit mechanism that establishes a reverse causality. There is no such mechanism in the rules (i.e. laws or regulations).<p>Oh, and if you are appalled because you believe that all this means that banks can just make loans as they please: they can&#x27;t. However, the limits on loans are set by <i>capital</i> requirements, and for good reason: capital is a suitable buffer against defaulting loans, reserves aren&#x27;t.",1383935116

6698019,comment,6695862,6697455,1,0,JRobertson,,,"In my opinion the major reasons for longer console cycles are development cycle time frames and hardware compatibility issues.<p>Graphics improved over the life of the last console generation until they plateaued.  To do that many game developers and game engines have to get down and write code at the hardware level to optimize as much as they can.  Add on the 1-5 year development time frame of many games and you&#x27;re in a scenario where updating hardware regularly actually becomes a big middle finger to many of your game developers.<p>Things that could change this:
- Newer Super Powerful hardware allows consoles can stay in the sub $500 price range and is strong enough to allow hardware level optimization to be done away with so that a 3-5 year game can work on multiple console versions (past or future).
- Revolutionary game development software that some how magically lets super AAA titles be made in months instead of years while also drastically dropping the price of a new release from $60 into the phone &quot;app&quot; range.
- Instead of hardware becoming substantially more powerful it becomes substantially cheaper and smaller.  If you could buy next gen consoles for under $200 it would be a hassle, but possible to own multiple generations so that you can play your 3 year old games as well as your new ones.<p>TLDR: Hardware is not the reason for long console release cycles, the games are.",1383934908

(Cf. @rayiner&#x27;s various comments on that subject.)  If people are envious by nature, that&#x27;s like the weather; to paraphrase Robert A. Heinlein, attempting to argue with the weather is seldom a profitable enterprise.<p>In any case, Bill Gates&#x27;s success was not due solely to his own efforts; he built his achievements on a foundation provided by his fellow citizens, of America and the world. So it&#x27;s not a <i>moral</i> axiom that Gates should keep some particular share of the money that happens to come into his hands. Cf. Elizabeth Warren&#x27;s famous talk during her campaign for the Senate, where on the subject of fair taxation she accurately pointed out that:<p><i>There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own  nobody. You built a factory out there? Good for you. But I want to be clear. You moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for. You hired workers the rest of us paid to educate. You were safe in your factory because of police-forces and fire-forces that the rest of us paid for. You didnt have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory  and hire someone to protect against this  because of the work the rest of us did.</i> [1]<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htX2usfqMEs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htX2usfqMEs</a>, starting at 0:50, <i>transcribed at</i> <a href=""http://spectator.org/blog/2011/09/22/elizabeth-warren-on-fair-taxat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spectator.org/blog/2011/09/22/elizabeth-warren-on-fai...</a>.",1383934823

On the other hand, computer software must be easily maintained, updated to add new functions, work on new systems, be easy for the end-user to operate, and limited in scope.

Generally speaking, the CTO/tech team also seems to believe that about themselves, and usually the CEO is personally self-effacing and does not have that kind of personal arrogance.<p>I know that there are dark days and uncertainty within a startup, and that you do have to &quot;fake it until you make it&quot;, but there&#x27;s a real danger in drinking that kool-aid and missing out on the fact that everything reverts to the mean, and not everyone can even be &quot;above average&quot;, let alone the smartest people in the world.  The reality is that your startup that&#x27;s survived to series A likely has pretty decent tech talent, but it&#x27;s unlikely that they&#x27;re significantly better than the tech talent at other startups that have survived similarly.<p>In particular, it is a big mistake to assume that your tech team is going to be able to solve problems that were really hard for other tech teams, unless you&#x27;re willing to make solving those problems one of your core competencies (and the other tech teams were not willing to do so).<p>As a tech co-founder, I am extremely appreciative of the support that I get from my CEO, but I would never want her to (nor does she) assume that I will be able to solve problems that other talented teams have failed to solve for way less money and/or in way less time and/or with way less organizational focus than they have.<p>So if you&#x27;re a tech CEO who believes that your CTO and tech teams are far superior to everyone else out there, I would say: the confidence is good, and probably necessary, but you have to make sure that you spend some of your time sober enough to acknowledge reality.",1383934672

6697928,comment,6696458,6697325,8,0,jjoonathan,,,"> I don&#x27;t care about inequality (of outcome). I care about suffering.<p>I subscribe to a different argument with the same conclusion: I care about the inefficiency in the way we, as a society, handle our human resources. Poverty is a morass of catch-22s that conspire to perpetuate the problem rather than solve it, and that&#x27;s a waste of human potential no matter how you slice it.<p>The minimum-wage worker who spends 1/3 of his time on his first job, 1/3 of his time on his second job, and 1/3 of his time in a perpetually unrewarding search for something better has no time or energy left for putting himself in a better position to create value for society. He is aware of the problem and he knows the theoretical solution. It is not necessarily a lack of discipline or market insight that hold him back, it&#x27;s the inability to take on risk in the form of investing time and resources into a new mode of value production that make it an unattractive option. If he tries and fails, food, shelter, and health care become mutually exclusive &quot;luxuries&quot; next month.<p>HN is full of entrepreneurs who are acutely aware of the importance of being able to take risks, but it is important to realize that we (the software engineering profession) are, at the moment, comparatively well sheltered from the wrath of the market by the fact that we posses a skill that is currently in demand, and even with this shielding many of us opt for risk aversion. If we fail, our fallback plan is a cushy $100k job that we can use as a springboard for our next attempt. Our &quot;punishment&quot; is a temporary stint at helping someone else build <i>their</i> dream. On the other hand, if Sam the supermarket checkout clerk, Mike the aspiring musician, or Anne the academic go into business and fail, their punishment will be far more draconian and far less amenable to taking another chance.<p>The thing is, we (as a society) don&#x27;t really want more supermarket clerks, street musicians, and struggling adjunct professors. We want these people to be successful because they will generate 100x the value if they are! But we are unwilling to invest the comparative pittance to cover their base needs to let them try and fail. If we played our cards right, social welfare would become an investment, not a parasitic nuisance. Unfortunately our current welfare policy (to include minimum wage) is filled with so many perverse incentives that it probably accounts for a solid half of the poverty-perpetuating morass of catch-22s I lamented earlier, if not more.<p>What&#x27;s funny is that I regularly see people on opposite sides of the socialist/libertarian axis agree abut both the problem and the solution, even if their intermediate reasoning is different. I think you&#x27;ll take my word about the socialists, but here&#x27;s Milton Friedman discussing the negative income tax: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtpgkX588nM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtpgkX588nM</a>",1383934243

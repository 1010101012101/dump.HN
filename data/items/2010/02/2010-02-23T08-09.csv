This is definitely a viable advertising platform--one that makes good use of the attractive qualities of capitalism, by inspiring competition and desire for collection within consumers, trading exposure--and (hopefully) real human currency--for fabricated (yet, if implemented correctly, completely desirable) points.<p>nickpp's point is off the mark. Human currency carries with it an unfortunate (but absolutely and obviously necessary) burden of seriousness. If you spend it foolishly, there's a chance you'll ""Game Over""--and (as my mom always used to tell me) there's no reset button in real life, sorry. Implementing a system where individuals apply a certain (limited) extent of value to a new, less dire, capitalistic system, is a win-win for everyone involved.<p>Blow all of your points on a retinal-based bar-code scanner that barely works?

Being successful generally means being a key part of a value chain that comes together at a certain time/place in society. Some experts do this. Some non-experts do this. Some non-experts become experts in the course of doing this. So what? A lot of people naturally put in 10,000+ hours doing the things they love the most anyway, and I'd bet they like being successful experts.

It's a principle that can be used to reconstruct any sort of signal from a small number of measurements. The only requirement is that we can find a representation for that signal that is sparse (every signal maps to some vector of mostly 0s). Luckily, most natural signals have this property (whereas random noise is not sparse in any representation).<p>The fundamental breakthrough here is that we can acquire signals (photos, recordings, MRI volumetric images, etc...) using a much smaller number of samples than previously thought possible.

Because founders get together in teams based mostly on knowing each other, having worked together, hearing about one another's reputation, and the like. The focus is on merit as displayed by real individuals that one knows or hears about and not merit as tied to some form of abstraction such as ""diversity.""<p>This does not mean that diverse teams can't come together. They can and do all the time. But it does mean that, if a non-diverse team of founders sees one another as the best people for the venture at hand, no one in a normal real-world situation is going to say, ""This won't work because we are not diverse enough."" In such cases, founders simply do <i>not</i> measure <i>merit</i> by this sort of criterion - it is hard enough finding good co-founders without superimposing arbitrary rules on top of an already difficult process!<p>My point is that ""diversity"" as an abstraction simply does not figure into most decisions about how to constitute a founding team when it comes to specific cases. Thus, while the argument of this piece may be commendable, I think it approaches the issue from an ineffective perspective with its focus on the constitution of founding teams. Men and women alike are free to form whatever founding teams they like and they will do so or not for specific reasons relating to the merits of the individuals involved, not based on ""merit"" that is defined by gender-based averages or assumptions.",1266912040

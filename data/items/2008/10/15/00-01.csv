I don't think that's a general characteristic, or at all necessary to success, but some people (I count myself amongst them) get fired up by adversity... Like a ""bring it on!"" mentality where you get more and more motivated to win the more problems there are...<p>I don't think people who react differently are in any way inferior, though, which the OP does seem to think.",1224030897

He’d broken the numbers down demographically and come up with a much less encouraging outcome for Clinton: a two-point squeaker in Indiana, and a seventeen-point drubbing in North Carolina. On the night of the primaries, Clinton took Indiana by one and lost North Carolina by fifteen. The national pundits were doubly shocked: one, because the results were so divergent from the polls, and two, because some guy named after a chili pepper had predicted the outcome better than anyone else.""<p>It will be great to see how his model stacks up against reality on election night.",1224030233

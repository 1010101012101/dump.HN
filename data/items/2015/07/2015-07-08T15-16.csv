For some architectures, the DoD had a say in this, too. See <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unisys_2200_Series_system_architecture"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unisys_2200_Series_system_ar...</a>)<p>36 bits got us the 6-bit character (10 digits, 26 letters, and punctuation) with six characters in a word. Because of that, some OSes had six-character file names.<p>If you want to get upper- and lowercase, you need more than 6 bits. 9 is the smallest divisor larger than 6 of 36, so nine-bit characters made sense.<p>On such systems, file names could still use 6-bit characters, while applications used 9-bit ones. Also, some instructions could work on words, half words, quarter words, or sixth words.",1436371097

9852431,comment,9851378,9851378,0,0,codegeek,,,"I am very interested in finding a co-founder for an existing project (already has paying clients). I tried using the various websites like cofounderslab etc but it is tough. The reason is that finding a co-founder is like finding a date that could turn into a serious relationship (think girlfriend/boyfriend/husband/wife). So this takes time and effort and cannot be solved by a listing website.<p>Here are some of the problems/challenges I have faced:<p>- Not everyone wants to become a co-founder. A lot of people just want to build things for you and get out. Think freelancers etc. Really smart people but not interested in becoming co-founders.<p>- A friend wants to be your co-founder. Ok great. You like them and they are really good friends. But you know for sure that they don&#x27;t have anything of value to offer to you. So you tell them &quot;I would love to but what do you bring to the table&quot; ? They cannot answer that and you are back to square one.<p>- A really smart friend whom you know could build great things together loves his/her job. He is the Employee type. No matter how much you try to convince them of the great entrepreneurial life, they won&#x27;t budge.<p>In my opinion, to find a co-founder who is not a friend or someone you know already, below are the steps:<p>1. Initial contact with someone who has interest in becoming a co-founder. This can be solved with those listing type websites perhaps.<p>2. AFTER that initial contact, what do we do  This is where the listing websites fail and cannot add any more value. This step/problem needs to be solved. My suggestion is that we will need to work together on &quot;small&quot; or &quot;baby&quot; projects first that may or may not be related to any actual business/product. Heck, lets build a blog together. Lets see how we interact with each other personally and professionally. I will like to spend a lot of time with you knowing your both personally and of course professionally. You may be the best programmer or marketer but can you handle pressure ? Can you actually commit to anything ? Are you a quitter ? Are you an honest person ? Can I trust you ? What is your vision ? What is your end Goal ? What do you want out of life ? All these questions need to be answered in my opinion and really vetted.<p>3. Once step 2 is reasonable secure, then lets actually become co-founders. Sign legal agreements, do vesting discussions, get lawyers involved etc ?<p>Just my 2 cents. I filled out your survey btw as well.",1436371084

Then I couldn&#x27;t collect because that judgement was essentially nullified because AA was going through bankruptcy.<p>I have 1k status with United -- I fly internationally with them almost monthly. The problems I&#x27;ve had with United have been when bags have to be interlined to Brussels Airlines and occasionally (surprisingly) Lufthansa. I&#x27;ve also had Lufthansa somehow think it was a good idea for 2 toddlers to sit in scattered seats rows away from their parents (who were also rows apart as well, despite having checked in almost 24 hours before the flight and being Star Alliance Gold.) I&#x27;ve had Brussels Airlines say they were going to &quot;gate check&quot; a stroller only to have it show up days later. I&#x27;ve been stranded in Detroit back in the Northwest Airlines days when aircrews hadn&#x27;t showed up to work. I&#x27;ve been stuck in Paris when the Air France pilots decide that salaries up to $300,000 per year just aren&#x27;t enough. On a recent United trip from Hartford to Marseille, I was stuck in Hartford for % extra hours for an airplane that was stuck in Newark (just a <50 minute flight away.) I then missed a cascade of connections leaving me rather miserable. However, United sorted the problem and got me on my way as quickly as possible. Let&#x27;s not forget Jet Blues antics on multiple occasions a few years ago: a 10.5 hour tarmac delay, a 7 hour tarmac delay among several other extremely long tarmac delays. AA had 14 long tarmac (over 3 hours) delays in February. United had zero long tarmac delays during the same period. Envoy/American Eagle was in last place for on-time arrivals last year.<p>I&#x27;m not defending United. I&#x27;m not disparaging the others. The fact is that the air transport industry is extremely complex and perceptions of quality are as varied as their are passengers in the sky.<p>Every airline sucks and every airline is great. Pick a day, pick a destination and roll the dice. When you fly often enough it seems like it all averages out to just one level of melancholic service; unless you&#x27;re flying on Singapore Airlines -- then it just becomes sublime.",1436371046

Postgres with datalog syntax would basically be a win by itself. Datomic queries are data, not strings. Queries can be composed without string munging, and with clear understanding of what that will do to the query planner.<p>The schema has built-in support for has-one, has-many relationships, so there&#x27;s no need for join tables.<p>I&#x27;ve never met a SQL query planner that didn&#x27;t get in the way at some point. If needed, you can bypass the query planner, and get raw access to the data, and write your own query.<p>You can run an instance of it in-memory, which is fantastic for unit tests, so you don&#x27;t have Postgres in production, but SQLite when testing.<p>The downsides:<p>It&#x27;s closed source.<p>Operationally, it&#x27;s unique.

I’ve been messing around with electronics for most of my life (early 30s) and have served as a robotics mentor for both students and adults. A couple buddies of mine (Dave, Mike) and I have been kicking around ideas for making learning electronics more accessible and fun for a while now.<p>The idea that we came up with is http://www.thimble.io. We want to motivate folks to learn and build electronics by featuring a different kit each month. The first one is a 2-wheel wifi robot. It is built around a laser-cut platform and arduino-derivative PCB I designed. (Featuring the popular esp8266 wifi module and a motor controller).<p>We started with the idea of virtual hackathons where we’d send everyone the same base kit and host a competition to see who performs the best (ie: which robot goes through a pre-designed course the fastest, who solves the problem the most interesting way, creativity, etc).<p>But, as we started talking to folks at Makercon, Makerfaire, etc. we also realized that most people we talked to want kits and a guided way to learn.<p>The basic idea is you get a kit delivered to your house once a month (or every other month if you want), you can use the learning app for any part you’re unfamiliar with and use it to guide you through the build. If you’re ambitious or more advanced, you can add additional sensors and functionality and enter your build into our monthly contests with prizes awarded by a unique panel of judges.<p>If this is interesting to you, we’d love to know your background in electronics (beginner, expert, etc)?
What kind of kits would you like to see?
What are your objectives from the kits?
Any more feedback you have or questions are appreciated.<p>We&#x27;re eager for feedback, so if you have any questions for us about this project or even the experience of working on a hardware startup, just ask.<p>Thanks!",1436370829

—Steve Yegge, &quot;Code&#x27;s Worst Enemy&quot; <a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.ca/2007/12/codes-worst-enemy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.ca/2007/12/codes-worst-enemy.htm...</a><p>I&#x27;m not quoting this to refute the idea that Ruby has terrible tooling, or to suggest that tooling doesn&#x27;t matter. But rather, to give some context for this idea:<p>When we first embraced Ruby, we were writing web apps in Java. Ruby allowed us to write those same apps with fewer lines of code, by fewer people, in less time. That was a triple-win, and there were all sorts of secondary positive effects.<p>Fewer people on a team means less necessary process. It means less money required. YCombinator wouldn&#x27;t exist today if you couldn&#x27;t have done something meaningful with $18,000 over a few months. Less time means you can be lean and iterate, rather than spending time and tons of money trying to analyze what a market wants in advance.<p>Those factors were massive wins for the startup culture. There are similar effects within companies, but I needn&#x27;t list them out here.<p>But one negative effect is that with small teams writing fewer lines of code, in a startup culture, there is much less emphasis on tooling. It&#x27;s a &quot;nice-to-have,&quot; because app complexity does not make the difference between shipping and not shipping.<p>So yeah, there&#x27;s some tooling, but it is not very good. Really, it&#x27;s not. But it was good enough.<p>But as time went on, our apps and teams grew. Most businesses are in a Red Queen&#x27;s Race against their competition. It is very hard to stay small and focused and have a single responsibility in a market. So our code grows and grows, until it reaches a kind of equilibrium with how many lines of code a company can support. Which means we expand until we&#x27;re back to having big code bases, with many engineers.<p>And guess what? One million lines of Java is easier to understand than one million lines of Ruby. Doubly so when you have better Java tooling than Ruby tooling, and when Ruby does things that demand better tooling.<p>So now we&#x27;re in this place where successful companies have big apps, but we don&#x27;t have a &quot;big app&quot; culture, so we don&#x27;t have the tooling required to support this many lines of Java, much less this many lines of Ruby.<p>---<p>p.s.

9852288,comment,9851505,9851980,0,0,louthy,,,"As someone who has been through C -> C++ -> C# and now F# and Haskell, I understand why initially you wouldn&#x27;t see what needs fixing.  The problem I have found as I have been working with larger and larger OO programs is that they&#x27;re incredibly difficult to manage in my mind.  Mutable state, dependency hierarchies, hidden state, unknown side-effects, etc.  Moving to functional programming has made everything much simpler (for me).<p>The idea of an object is fine, but it doesn&#x27;t need methods attached to it.  Also, by making an object immutable, anything can have a reference to it, and do what it likes with it because everything else pointing to it essentially has a &#x27;snapshot&#x27; of the world at that point-in-time.<p>That makes it very easy to move packets of data around a system, without the burden of the attached methods.  And if multiple processes have a reference to the object, they know that what they know is true now, is going to be true when they come back to use the object again.<p>Once you detach the functionality from the data, and once the thing you&#x27;re pointing at can&#x27;t change, then you realise that actually everything you do (applying functions) is a projection from an input to an output, and that state is an emergent property of the function.  Therefore you don&#x27;t need to manage this morass of ever changing objects.<p>A request can project to a response, a query can project to a list of results, etc.<p>Then all outputs are dependent on only one thing, the input.  Not shared mutable state, not unknown side-effects, etc.  Then everything is testable and provable, and it&#x27;s very easy to test and prove, rather than requiring elaborate mocking frameworks, dependency injection, etc.<p>The more I did this, the easier I found it to keep a mental map of my programs.  And ultimately that&#x27;s the major thing that programmers have to deal with.  It&#x27;s our own weak and feeble minds that get in the way of developing more complex programs, and we&#x27;ve developed these elaborate techniques to help ourselves.<p>For me functional programming is another one of those crutches, and it&#x27;s a damn powerful one.  Because I know that once a function, that projects an immutable type to another immutable type is written, it stays written.  It doesn&#x27;t suffer from code-rot as the rest of the app grows around it.  I can then safely park that part of the program in the &#x27;done&#x27; pile and never worry about it again.<p>Finally, most of the things that are supposed to be OOP&#x27;s strong points (like polymorphism, encapsulation and modularity), I feel, can be done better in functional languages.  Pretty much every pattern in the GoF Design Patterns book can be better implemented using functional techniques.<p>Anyway, your mileage may vary obviously, but as a reformed OO programmer, I&#x27;d definitely advise you to give it a shot.  It takes a bit of time to sink in, but it&#x27;s worth it.",1436370058

I don&#x27;t see a moral difference between eating a fruit and and an egg, or salmon and a herb, milk/blood and maple syrup. The arguments that fauna are somehow more alive than fauna has never felt very strong to me. We&#x27;ve all been evolving and finding our niche for about the same amount of time. We&#x27;ve all got our own versions of response to external stimuli. Its just much harder to empathize with an apple tree than a chicken, especially when it comes to the ultimate sacrifice.<p>However, the ecological arguments for vegetarianism around sustainability and CO2 emission seem sound for the standard american lifestyle.<p>Of course that starts to flip if you hunt (I don&#x27;t). Large scale agriculture does more damage to the environment than culling native mega fauna, which is arguably beneficial. It flips again, if you have your own garden, supplemented by local, organic specialists. And then you reach a much better level of reuse/yield if you can feed scraps to chickens and pigs and fertilize your ground with blood and bone meal. (it always makes me laugh when vegans think their organic vegetables are &#x27;cruelty free&#x27;).<p>So, no. I don&#x27;t think the implications of saying you are vegetarian are immediately obvious. The more I research it, the healthier and more sustainable a diet of mostly fruit and vegetables supplemented by the meat of a couple of pigs, 6 or so chickens and the occasional hunt seems to be. But if you genuinely believe that fauna are some how better than flora I guess that simplifies the equation and somewhere down that path you get labelled a zealot.<p>I suspect the same is true with programming. What you want is a system of mostly functional business logic that is supplemented with objects when it makes sense (modeling the state of an electrical circuit?!?), and the odd &#x27;declarative hunting trip&#x27; when you need  to cull the date from the database :)<p>It is possible exist on just objects, or just functions but variety is the spice of life and the sum is often greater than the whole.",1436370027

We&#x27;re already improving AI using an intelligence that will only be available to the AIs themselves in a very long time, and yet this rate of improvement is not a scary doomsday rate.<p>Look at hardware for example. We&#x27;ve been using computers to design better computers for a very long time. And yet,  the use of computers in this design is effectively limited by some non decisive, local optimizations, like achieving good routing and good electromagnetic compatibility. If you had supercomputers from 30 years ago you could still run the software that designs computers today -- whereas if you followed this &quot;self-improvement&quot; logic we should be using almost all of our computational power right now to achieve more computational power. The problem is that we are still vastly more capable of building theories and designing than computers. By the time an AI gets much better than we currently are at independently improving it&#x27;s software, it will likely already be seeing diminishing returns; to achieve notable improvement it will need to improve hardware as well, which has the same problem, and an additional one that it&#x27;s very hard for an AI to independently improve it&#x27;s own hardware (it requires a global manufacturing supply chain).",1436369888

That means the government is <i>automatically</i> by definition totalitarian if it removes the possibility of this protocol, by acknowledging that it is overseeing it.  (This is an extreme example, but imagine you can no longer tell your friend a joke, because you have to include the government in on the joke.

They relinquish that right only when they do something like create a ransomware virus or some brazen criminal act that hurts everyone.  You can&#x27;t say it doesn&#x27;t happen, because it does every day.<p>If the government has no extraordinary powers in these cases, that means it&#x27;s up to everyone to personally armor up.

This isn&#x27;t helpful.<p>Instead, you need to extend the metaphor in a different direction. Let&#x27;s keep photons as cannonballs flying in straight lines. But now, imagine the cannonballs are constantly spinning. Some are spinning fast - they have a lot of rotational energy - they rotate with a high frequency. Others are spinning more slowly - low frequency, low energy cannonballs.<p>Now, which way are they spinning? Some have topspin or backspin, meaning they have a horizontal spin axis; some have sidespin - their axis of spin is vertical. Others might be spinning in a spiral - as if the barrel they came out of was rifled - so their axis of spin is aligned with the axis they&#x27;re flying along.<p>You can imagine lots of cannonballs all flying along the same path, at the same speed, but they can all have different spin frequencies, and be spinning around different axes. Amplitude means more cannonballs. Higher frequency means more cannonballs spinning faster. Polarization means all the cannonballs are spinning round the same axis. Coherence (like in a laser) means all the cannonballs are spinning at the same speed and are pointing the same way as they pass the same point.<p>This maybe works better as a way to layer on the additional attributes a photon has - a frequency and a polarization - than to try to imagine some sort of transverse wave pattern. It also helps you deal with the idea of &#x27;how do different photons carry different amounts of energy?&#x27;.<p>But, this is just a metaphor. Photons aren&#x27;t really spinning cannonballs. It doesn&#x27;t explain why thin slits cause polarization (and gives you a probably somewhat intuitive but definitely very wrong explanation for why bouncing photons off a surface causes polarization, so be careful.). It won&#x27;t get you one jot closer to understanding quantum mechanics (no classical metaphor can do that), but it might just help you visualize how light can have mixtures of frequencies, polarizations, and amplitude, while still being just a bunch of particles.",1436369453

, the listener who uses mutable state views the FP&#x27;s attitude as judgemental</i><p>I disagree with your meta-analysis of where the root of perceiving &quot;arrogance&quot; comes from.<p>(I&#x27;ll shall attempt to speak for non-practicing functional programmers and the following opinion is not my own.)<p>In my observations, it&#x27;s that all the essays and evangelizations about functional programming do not manifest themselves in the industry as <i>irrefutable evidence</i> that it creates better programs, with less bugs, at higher rates of productivity.<p>For example, folks can point to Jane Street using OCaml, or a London finance shop using F#, but are they doing 10x better than Goldman Sachs using the clunky C++ language?  Maybe.  But we won&#x27;t know because there are too many confounding factors.<p>Functional programmers can repeat all the &quot;benefits&quot; of the style with &quot;<i>immutable</i>&quot;, and &quot;<i>referential transparency</i>&quot;, &quot;<i>monads</i>&quot;, etc, and describe languages in glowing terms such as &quot;<i>Haskell has this beautiful internal mathematical consistency that Java doesn&#x27;t</i>&quot; or &quot;<i>Lisp with its homoiconicity lets you write a DSL as first-class concepts with macros whereas C++ makes you force-fit them into classes</i>&quot;, etc, etc.<p>All those bullet points may be <i>true</i> but it doesn&#x27;t manifest itself as obvious slam dunk winnings in the industry.<p>That&#x27;s the root of the arrogance:  the attitude of &quot;superiority&quot; about functional ideas does not match what people see on the street.  In other words, people wonder why there are no AAA game studios using functional programming that blows everyone else out of the water crawling on their hands & knees with C++.  Or some application software company using Haskell to deliver software with 10x less bugs, 10x faster, and 1/10th less cost than their competitors using Java.  Or some YC company using 100% functional language and killing their competitors stupidly using Python/PHP.<p>So far, there are hundreds (thousands?) of tutorials about monads and recursive Fibonacci snippets but very few case studies (if any) of real companies killing the competition as a <i>direct result of the functional programming language.</i>  Companies showing massive industry results is how you win hearts & minds.  Fibonacci exercises are not enough.<p>What the functional community needs are better essays that go beyond &quot;monads&quot; and addresses <i>why the mystery gap exists</i> between functional theory and industry results.  My guess is that the <i>functional benefits are real</i> but there are <i>other aspects</i> of software craft that overwhelm its advantages.  In other words, the essays needs to look at functional style holistically.<p>As a historical analogy, the benefits of structured programming languages vs machine language were initially debated in 1960s.  However, within less than a decade, everyone adopted it because the multiplication of productivity was obvious and compelling.  The ease of programming wasn&#x27;t just a 10x improvement, it was arguably a 100x improvement.  Now, assembly is only done for isolated pockets of tight loops and resource constrained scenarios.<p>If the FP>OOP is similar to Structured>Assembly, then for some reason, the real world has not shown that same magnitude of increased benefits.  Fix that perception and the root of &quot;arrogance&quot; goes away.  Today, we don&#x27;t say one is &quot;arrogant&quot; for explaining that structured programming will allow teams to write software faster with less bugs.<p>Imo, that&#x27;s the type of self-reflection that functional essays are missing.",1436369303

The reality was I just wasn&#x27;t recognizing all the opportunities ripe for solutions.  Pick things in your lives that you are frustrated and passionate about, otherwise a startup is doomed to fail.  I say that because passion is the only thing that will sustain you when life is sucking as it will occasionally in a startup.<p>At the same time, maybe this is a point you should get an internship or job to gain the experience to know what might be of interest.  I personally never recommend that a college student go looking to start a company unless they already have a really deep passion for an issue and it is marketable.

Therefore, it&#x27;s required not only to find personal reasons for the choice but also to convince a not insignificant number of your colleagues to make the same choice. This means that some portion of language advocacy is a war for survival in a way that vegetarianism isn&#x27;t (at least until you have to choose what restaurant to go to with some vegetarians in the crowd—tension grows).<p>(To be clear, I&#x27;m just noting this, not trying to be a proponent of it!)<p>So that fuels asshole behaviors because one wants to find a justification not only that an alternative exists and works but that it is actually <i>better</i>.

Every action they take is therefore hostile in that it is impossible for them to offer a legitimate cure.<p>In honesty, that idea is completely false. Language really matters a ton and is merely a very complex decision not a meaningless one. Each language offers its own sets of cures and downsides and actual decisions are tricky.<p>So when an FPer comes with arguments, legitimate but complex ones, that FP significantly improves programming experience/outputs then making the trade-analysis to your personal needs is a big undertaking. When, further, they do this with at least some motive to convert you, it&#x27;s a forced, big undertaking. Finally, when you balk a bit at the potentially massive investment with uncertain return involved in analyzing a new language for a project and this is thrown back at you as a failure to recognize the legitimate value of FP. Well, that&#x27;s easy to see as asshole-y.<p>What makes a language community fun? Lots of ways to get started, lots of positive, non-forced examples of benefits, and a community oriented around perfecting their own trade not proselytization.

+$0.02. I served several years on a housing co-op board for a 156 unit urban high-rise (including as treasurer) and cooperative ownership is itself not a cure all, only the composition of the &quot;ownership&quot; is different. The shareholders (tenants) pool their investment, true, and then go on to create a corporate structure, elect a board, draw up rules and enforce them, assign duties, levy fees and payments, hire staff, contract, etc. It&#x27;s a fairly ordinary corporation in most respects. The co-op is the landlord and it&#x27;s quite a business to run even when things are going well and everyone pulls in the same direction and individuals don&#x27;t cause each other trouble. When things go wrong (as they always do) or shareholders disagree (as they always do) or people behave badly (as they always do), it&#x27;s exceedingly challenging and because it&#x27;s a mix of personal and business there are some tough decisions and terrible hard feelings.<p>I agree capital tends to avoid housing co-ops because they smell funny and act differently and the laws around them are a mess. As a result, it&#x27;s harder to assess the risk for a co-op than other businesses and more complicated to borrow, contract, etc.",1436368641

Pure FP (PFP) has a clear definition, but I challenge you to find a definition for FP that includes Clojure, Erlang, F#, and OCaml but excludes Java, JS, Ruby, Python, C++. All of these languages are imperative with varying amounts of reliance on higher-order functions and emphasis on immutability (for example, my favorite so-called-FP language, Clojure, allows global mutation all over the place, but provides some transactional assurances).<p>Second, even if we consider PFP alone (which is, indeed, different from imperative programming), I often find that some of its proponents are lacking in understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of imperative programming. For example, day before yesterday I gave a talk at CurreyOn/ECOOP about why monads are harmful in imperative languages (i.e. any language that isn&#x27;t PFP), and PFP experts present weren&#x27;t aware (although, TBH, neither was I, but I&#x27;m not a PL researcher) of this proof[1] that imperative continuations are at least as powerful and easy to express as monads (I later claimed and provided evidence that they&#x27;re more powerful).<p>There is actually much to debate about the relative merits of PFP and imperative, but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t say that PFP is &quot;avoiding badness&quot;. It&#x27;s avoiding some badness while introducing other kinds of badness (monads have some serious disadvantages), while imperative programmers can avoid the same badness without resorting to PFP (e.g. as Clojure and Erlang do).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.43.8213"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.43.8...</a>",1436368610

9851976,comment,9849233,9849233,0,0,jhallenworld,,,"I&#x27;ve recently tried to fix JOE (a UNIX portable program) so that it will compile without warnings and with minimum casting with -Wconversion.  This is what I&#x27;ve found:<p>Chars: I hate it that they are signed because I like the convention of promoting them to int, and then using -1 as an error.  It&#x27;s easy to forget to convert to unsigned first, and the compiler will not complain.  In the past I&#x27;ve used &#x27;unsigned char&#x27; everywhere, but it&#x27;s a mess because strings are chars and all library functions expect chars.  My new strategy is to use 256 as the error code instead of -1.  The only problem is that getchar() uses -1, so it&#x27;s weird.  IMHO, it&#x27;s a C-standard mistake that char is signed.<p>I used to use int for indexes and long for file offsets.  But these days, int is too short on 64-bit systems and long is not large enough on 32-bit systems.<p>ptrdiff_t is the new int.  I&#x27;ve switched to ptrdiff_t in place of int and off_t in place of long.  Ptrdiff_t is correct on every system except maybe 16-bit MS-DOS (where it&#x27;s 32-bits, but I think it should be 16-bits).  Off_t is a long long if you have &#x27;#define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS 64&#x27;.  Ptrdiff_t is ugly and is defined in an odd include file: stddef.h.  It&#x27;s not used much by the C library.<p>The C library likes to use size_t and ssize_t.  The definition of ssize_t is just crazy (it should just be the signed version of size_t, but it isn&#x27;t).<p>I understand why size_t is unsigned, but I kind of wish it was signed.  It&#x27;s rare that you have items larger than 2^(word size - 1), so signed is OK.  You are guaranteed to have -Wconversion warnings if you use size_t, because ptrdiff_t is signed (even if you don&#x27;t use ptrdiff_t, you still get a signed result to pointer differences so you will have warnings).  Anyway, to limit the damage I make versions of malloc, strlen and sizeof which return or take ptrdiff_t.  They complain if the result is ever negative.  Yes this is weird, but I think it&#x27;s better than having many explicit casts to fix warnings.  Casts are always dangerous.",1436367751

My house would cost at least $287,500 to replace with a dome; in contrast, it would cost about $150,000 to replace it with another wood-framed house.  Concrete block costs would depend heavily on how complex the floor plan is, but would still be cheaper than a monolithic dome.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.monolithic.org/forms/the-residential-evaluator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.monolithic.org/forms/the-residential-evaluator</a>",1436367625

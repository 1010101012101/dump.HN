4240934,comment,4240788,4240788,9,0,mkaltenecker,,,"Im thinking about whether this is an atypical reaction by Apple and I think its not but Im not sure.<p>The pattern is typical  more or less. Some criticism appears. Apple is dead silent for a few days. Apple has a comprehensive response to the criticism. (Alternative that also happens frequently: Apple doesnt ever mention the criticism.) Thats what used to happen in the past, thats what nearly happened here.<p>The difference is that they responded with a different message pretty quickly after the criticism (arguing that EPAT isnt such a great certification) so its not true that they staid completely silent.<p>When it comes to the message itself, I dont think its that atypical. Apple rarely responds to criticism, so there are few situations we can use to compare. Its not as big a deal as Atennagate  so they picked a less involved way to respond (basically a press release instead of a press conference)  but in every other respect its pretty similar.<p>This time there is a clearer Mea Culpa but the undertone is still that EPAT is a bad certification. (During the Antennagate press conference the undertone was that its not really that big of a deal  and it was a much more obvious undertone.) The tradition of Apple execs writing letters is also continued.<p>I would only say that Steves letters tended to be more about presenting arguments. That has certainly something to do with the different purposes (explain why DRM/Flash are bad vs. admit that you were wrong and reverse direction) but I still would have preferred if Bob Mansfield had explained more of Apples reasoning.",1342202269

They would like to delay this kind of ""acquired worldly knowledge"" as long as they can. I feel the same way as a parent myself. As to what age is appropriate, it is unique to each child and the family. Keep in mind that the decision making part of the brain does not really mature until late preteen age. All my students have special needs and parents need to be extra cautious.

It's frustrating when I have to make up a new username and password just to try out some service where the ill effects would be small if someone gained access to the account.<p>It's only supposed to take ""a few seconds,"" but then I have to pick a new username because the one I used was already taken. That one too. Type in the CAPTCHA again. Also that one. Oh, and the password doesn't have enough numbers and uppercase letters (we could have told you our unnecessary restrictions in advance but we didn't). Type in the CAPTCHA again. Now the new password is too long. Now I have to make up a security answer (no, I'm not going to use the same info I give to my bank). Type in the CAPTCHA again. No, you got the CAPTCHA wrong, try again, and also enter your new password again. Now I have to log into my password manager to store all this stuff. And we're done! Oh no, now I have to wait to get an e-mail to confirm my address. Still waiting...<p>It's at the point where I often just bounce when someone wants me to make up a new password.",1342200970

You only ever need to enter credentials once and the AccountManager will store them.  Apps can ask for tokens from the AccountManager so they never get the actual password.  And new apps can be installed that add themselves to the AccountManager list (eg Dropbox, LinkedIn, Skype etc do this).  This is how it should work.<p><a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/accounts/AccountManager.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/accounts/Acco...</a><p>iOS drives me nuts.  There was an old joke dialog years ago ""Windows has detected that you r mouse moved.  You must reboot for this change to take effect.""  The contemporary version seems to be ""iOS has detected you want to do something.  You must enter a password (yet again) for this to happen.""  I can't understand why people are ok with this - your password should be long and hard to type and hence virtually impossible to enter on a mobile device.<p>You can always tell the iOS apps that were ported to Android because they have their own UI for asking for your account information instead of using the system.  They also almost universally believe you only have one of a kind of account - eg only one Google account.  Who doesn't have multiple ones these days (school, work, personal etc)?",1342200836

Probably the only thing I read religiously in the MAA.<p>BMI is just one of several mistakes attributed to the great mathematician Quetelet. You can credibly implicate Quetelet for a variety of modern day statistical crimes such as profiling ( attempting to figure out if a person is a criminal based on statistical analysis of race/sex/height/etc...),""normal"" age of marriage, statistical rates of divorce in different countries and their implications on fidelity, and such other sociological nonsense.<p>Dr. Devlin labels these things ""junk math, numerological nonsense"". But you can take a more charitable view - given that Quetelet practically invented both statistics & sociology ( which he called ""physics of society"" ), he came up with a number of formulae that seemed true at that time ( mid 1800s ). On hindsight much of this stuff is just silly mathematical manipulation ( Instead of dividing weight by square of height & multiplying by the constant 703, you can square the weight & divide by the cube root of height and put in some other constant...)
If you are interested in the kind of statistics practiced in  Quetelet's timeframe, here's some wacky references.<p><a href=""http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_1/May_1872/Quetelet_on_the_Science_of_Man"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume...</a><p><a href=""http://statistiks.net/wp-content/plugins/downloads-manager/upload/v0101021.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://statistiks.net/wp-content/plugins/downloads-manager/u...</a><p>btw, much of what we do today in quant finance is suspiciously similar to what Quetelet suggests :) We build statistical ""factor models"" that credibly relate earnings of a company in california to the price of chicken in China :) We take a rigged number called the LIBOR & price interest rate derivatives on the spead between this rigged fixed rate & the floating rate. Then the public loses money & we scream - hey who the fuck rigged the LIBOR in the first place ?:) Talk about bootstrapping... honestly, we are no different from Dr. Quetelet.

We went to the moon because there was an overwhelming desire to 'beat' the soviets; if a similar desire competitor existed today, I imagine a similar effort.
As for winning WWII, its the same basic point that at that time there was an obvious single good to be pursued, winning the war, whereas now there are many different goods. This isn't the fault of our elites or our efficiency, it just points to the fact that we live in a pluralistic society.

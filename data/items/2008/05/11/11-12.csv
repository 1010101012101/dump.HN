They've said this many times.<p>If they did, here's my past few searches: jordan ritter, glowing resin bar, mac hard drive use visualization, ironport, joost commercial, photoshop light bar, wiki futurama, wiki lost, xserve g4 wiki<p>What does that list tell you about me or my buying habits? Now expand that list by a few thousand random search terms. Any more detail?",1210506572

And those are just some simple cases. In the context of that, using any single digital communication mechanism only allows me to communicate with a subset of the people I care about.<p>Anyways, my point was that the ads on facebook can be obnoxious enough that it spurs someone to install adblocking software",1210505519

Do you, the customer, really care what kind of tools they use?""<p>The customer probably doesn't care, but recruiters certainly do.  They want a 'C# developer' or 'experience of VB.NET' rather than a 'good programmer', which is probably what they should be looking for.<p>If the writer is saying he'd avoid working with someone who would only use his own favourite language no matter what, then I'd agree with him.  However, I'd also be suspicious of an experienced programmer who didn't have strong views on operating systems, languages, and text editors/IDEs.  If you don't care about these things, you probably don't care about programming.",1210503626

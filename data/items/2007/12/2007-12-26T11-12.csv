This will be done through a lot of innovation in the ad targeting systems (both behavioral and contextual) and new metrics being adopted by Madison Ave beyond CPC and CPM.<p>This was the only prediction that caught my eye.  I hadn't thought about it before but it's the obvious next step and I'm not talking about viral marketing.  Along this vain I think you are going to see the first big push in 2008 for advertising in and with games as well as more utilization of direct interaction with bloggers, both written and video.

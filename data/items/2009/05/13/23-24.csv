Privacy and copyright are more like slavery (not making a moral statement here!), in that after certain technological advances, it's just not possible to sustain them and continue competing economically.  That's what I mean when I say that privacy is dead: without some unforeseen technological problem (or solution, if you're so inclined) that makes it possible to control other people's computers with your software against their will, it's only a matter of time until societal mores catch up and recognize the de facto situation.",1242259067

607897,comment,607487,607487,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"I think the question to be asked, is the question of if it is in the self-interest of the American taxpayer to subsidize schools in Iraq and Afghanistan. Now, this is hard to answer. On one hand, it is unclear how more schools in these countries serve our national interest. On the other hand, without education, young people are more privy to fall into the brainwashing of terrorists. So one could make the argument that if one spends on education, that enhances national security by having more educated people in these unstable countries and therefore fewer people who are possible recruits for terrorists. I guess it is all in the way one does it, if one builds schools with good oversight (i.e. overseen by the coalition and Iraqi/Afghan governments) then one could perhaps justify that. However, if there is no oversight, then who knows what kind of stuff might end up getting taught there. We obviously don't want to spend our tax dollars building schools only so that religious extremists can teach in them. The same is true incidentally in the United States. Government vouchers for private schools are wrong, because these private schools often teach nonsense like Intelligent Design, which to my mind is the Ultimate-747-In-The-Junkyard-As-Designer theory and merits no serious consideration, let alone our tax dollars. So if there is a self-interest in our national security in helping with education in Iraq and Afghanistan that may be justifiable, provided there is strict oversight, and if there is no oversight then it is a no go. Similar to how education here at home should not have tax dollars going to private religious agendas. Ideally of course I think states, and not the federal government, should handle education, since this is an issue of federalism, but that is another issue than the present discussion.",1242257431

Back then, all the VCs lived up north in urban San Francisco, and all the startup employees lived in auto-oriented suburbs down there.<p>Eventually many VCs moved their offices south, but nowadays more and more of the startups are actually in San Francisco.  The SF lifestyle of easy walkability, little dependence on cars, vastly better restaurants, bars, shops, and entertainment, and all the other advantages of a dense city, appeal more to many of the current generation of hackers, and make SF more characteristic of contemporary startups than the old historic corridor located an hour south.<p>One of the interesting sights every morning now in San Francisco are all the private wifi-equipped coaches picking up employees for their free hour ride down to Google, Microsoft SVC, and other mega-employers located on large campuses in SV.  Those employees, like startup founders, increasingly prefer to live in SF (and refuse to commute by car for two hours a day).<p>The ""valley advantage"" is much the same in both areas, and there's a fair amount of interchange, but the two areas are very different, and they are far enough apart to discourage casual traveling between them.

I'm guessing that number is people who have downloaded the SDK (which is available for free).<p>There are only about 35,000 apps, and the average number of apps per developer (who has an app on the store at all) is probably closer to 2 than 1. Even with twice as many paid developers as people who have shipped apps, you're talking about a maximum of 75,000 devs.",1242256635

It's usually followed immediately by a ""CLUNK"" as I toss the disk in the trash.<p>If the disk shows up in the BIOS disk scan, or when Linux detects the disks, you might still be able to get some data off of it with dd.  That'd be my first plan, if I were in your shoes.<p>If that doesn't work, you might have some luck with the logic assembly replacement idea.  If it's the controller circuitry that's out of whack, it might be fixed by a new board.  If the motor or head are actually sticking and unable to do their job, it's a more dramatic situation.  And, I'm not sure what the mechanics of such things look like these days.  This might be one of those situations where putting the platters in another identical drive is the only option.<p><i>Did you say ""recent backups""? Ha. That's funny.</i><p>Yes.  You'll learn.

The only thing it does is allow them to make more money.  Many need that cash: pay off loans, ROI for all their training etc..<p>What would happen if doctors only worked a 4 day, 40 hour work week?  We would obviously need more doctors to make up the shortfall.  There would be costs associated with that, but once we doubled the number of doctors, there may be some great financial and quality benefits for all parties.  The only downside is most doctors would make less, but they would have still be upper-middle class and have a very comfortable life.",1242256197

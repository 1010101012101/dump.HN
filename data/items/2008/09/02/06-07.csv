292490,comment,292351,292351,0,0,derefr,,,"I don't quite understand this. I may not be using OpenID correctly, but when I ask my users to login, they just pop in their OpenID URI (that is, their username--that's what it's labeled as on my webapps, and that's what it is) and get auto-directed through their provider's auth system, showing up as simply a two-second redirect. When they don't have an OpenID URI yet, I send them over to a provider <i>I</i> trust--right to their registration form--with the first part (their desired username) already filled in. How is this harder than normal registration? The only difference is that, when you aren't logged into the provider and you have to enter your password, it goes on the second login page, rather than the first. I don't even call it an ""OpenID provider"" in the FAQ, but a ""security service."" That's what it appears as to people: someone I've outsourced all the cryptography and password stuff to so <i>I</i> don't have to be smart about it.<p>Those that know about OpenID can use their own providers, but those that don't <i>care</i> won't have to think about it; they'll just use the one I pick (which is no worse than trusting me with their made-up-on-the-spot credentials, which is what they'd be doing otherwise anyways.) If they <i>start</i> caring, they can make a new ID with a provider they choose--I fully allow for account URI changes; it's not that hard to implement. In fact, the whole OpenID set-up for me was two library calls (discounting the fact that I had to hack the library itself to add in Simple Registration support, so I could automatically set users' nicknames to their OpenID accounts' nicknames on each login. It's discountable because I submitted a patch, so no one else will have to worry about it.)",1220338261

Shame is, that artists don't see their fair share.  Everyone always asks me what I would do if Publictivity or another venture gave me what the Valley calls ""F<i></i>k You Money""... I'd go right after the RIAA and turn the music industry upside down on its head.

I had -6.00 in one eye and -6.50 in the other and LASIK was the best decision I ever made. Shop around for quality doctors, and do your research... I found that given the degree of nearsightedness, it really came down to your eye's topology, which if examined correctly(through a 3-D wave imaging system), explains the features of your eye in detail and profoundly assists in determining whether or not you're a candidate... here's a short bit on it: <a href=""http://www.lasikaide.com/Lasik-Wave-Front.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lasikaide.com/Lasik-Wave-Front.aspx</a> it's very similar to brain scanning systems and MRIs...<p>This is just my experience.

292481,comment,292320,292320,0,0,DenisM,,,"Here's an interesting observation, if a bit dangerous for my karma:<p>On average a succefull media outlet is serving the interest of its audience, otherwise audience will leave and the new one may never come. So you have Fox News with republican audience that only shows them the news and views they want to see. Then there is some similar liberal news outlet that is also careful not to expose the users to an uncomfortable thought. In some sense this is an ""Innovator's Dilemma, media edition"" - the customers hold producers hostage by using their consumption preferences.<p>So where am I going with this? There is a distinct flavor of media that is railing against ""management"". Dilbert being the flag and the articles like the one linked is the rank and file. The article is pretty much devoid of content and is full of emotional appeal to anymosity against ""them"" and affinity with ""us, the sane folks"". Just like the previously mentioned political ""news"" media.<p>In other words when reading your favorite rant you are reading the content of your own head, as best guessed by the author and selected by your filters.<p>Most of the time you are reading yourself.<p>...no mushrooms were hurt in production of this message...",1220337600

It's the best one there is.<p>That said, it works best when the receiving site uses the ClickPass button: without that, the login still takes longer than it ought to. With the button, it's as fast as Facebook Connect, but it has the downside that fewer users are using it, and that it offers no service BESIDE login. Facebook has an edge there, too, in that it offers functionality that users want to actively use, so FConnect is a logical extension rather than a brand-new concept.",1220337170

But it is true that this figure could have been done with python, IDL or anything else.</i><p>True that you could have done it with python, or IDL, or dozens of other tools, but I'd challenge you to do it with the built in stuff that comes with Windows or MacOS <= 9.  Those programs you mentioned are environments specialized for doing things like making figures (among other things).  I doubt K&R would've said one of the main objectives of *nix is to make a system that can easily create figures.  Something that unifies all the things you mentioned is that they are inherently text-based, while the OSes I mentioned are inherently not.<p>If you're a polyglot, you'll notice that there are some things you like about some languages, and things you don't like.  So you might prefer to express some kinds of thoughts in one language, and this is equivalent to using a different (text-based) environment.  But when you get down to it, you are expressing the thought through the lens of a spoken/written language, each of which has its own literature.  Pictures, on the other hand, are fundamentally different, and I'd be hesitant to call a sculpture a piece of literature (although it may well be an incredible work of art).  I'd be curious to know how many people in the author's Unix shop were Art History majors.",1220335980

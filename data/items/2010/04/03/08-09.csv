We are definitely damn close. Yeah, ok, so that’s ten years ago, Jobs wrote his letter three years ago, so maybe we have to wait another seven years :)",1270283262

A large segment of the population doesn't do any computing on the go - but have in recent years been buying laptops (and then just leaving them in one place) just for the simplicity and the ease of setup/use. If desktops can clone this (and the iMac has for the most part) and give a better user experience (almost guaranteed) there's a lot of room here.",1270283179

It is good that people watching the photos can see who are in them, and go to their profiles. The problem is that it also shows up under ""Photos of X"" where potential employers and girlfriends parents can see them. So you you have to go and untag yourself from any photos where you look stupid.<p>Let me remove pictures from ""Photos of X"" while still staying tagged in them.",1270283131

1238403,comment,1237078,1238027,0,0,jrmg,,,"You're being, probably not deliberately, a bit disingenuous here.  If this was any time after the 80s, the BASIC that the machine came with was /not/ the same thnig that was used to make professional programs.  A C compiler or assembler would cost you more than $99 in today's money.<p>On the iPhone (or iPad), you can run web apps you write with no restriction - and today's Javascript is hardly less powerful in comparison to the machine than yesterday's BASIC.<p>You can download and use, if you have Mac, Xcode for free, only having to pay the $99 if you want to load your app onto the device.  I'd say this compares pretty favorably to the dev tool pricing of old.<p>About the only /practical/ argument I see here is that you can't program an iPhone or iPad using the device itsself, but that's not even entirely true - there are web sites out there that let you code in web technologies from a browser (hrm, maybe that's a business idea - code iPad web apps from the iPad Safari...).",1270282885

At that point it makes more sense to just not go to school.<p>Unsecured debt like student loans has incredible risks and the laws in the US aren't very strong in favor of forcing people to repay so a lot choose to just ignore the loans causing them to be even riskier and screwing it for the people who plays fair. Eliminating the subsidy without looking at everything else in play here is dangerous.",1270282785

Ditto for baked meats - prepare the marinade, let soak while you work, come back and throw in the oven and set the timer, take out when done.  You can then use the left over meat for sandwiches all week. Pasta is pretty easy too - boil, cut tomatoes and veggies and add spices to top it off.",1270282374

1238392,comment,1220883,1222820,0,0,joelhaus,,,"I completely disagree. The excerpt you reference applies equally and without regard to accreditation. Just because accredited investors are the only ones involved does not mean an offering is exempt. The general conditions still apply.<p>Let's assume the offering is exempt (probably because the issuer used grellas). My question is about whether the issuer has significantly greater ongoing compliance requirements (either contractually imposed or imposed by regulatory bodies) due to the use of accredited investors.<p>My guess would be yes; if only because they are more competent and require greater detail in the reporting of the issuers activities. I may have minced some words earlier, but the same goes for a public vs. private offering. While the initial exemption may provide greater flexibility to the issuer, I don't see how accredited investors mean less risk. I'd think the opposite were actually true, as you would be less likely to get favorable terms unless they think you are the next Sergey and Larry.<p>If there is a case to be made (outside of the 12 mo. cap on the allowed amount of capital raised) that non-accredited sources are riskier than accredited ones, please do share.",1270281708

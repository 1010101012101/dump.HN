839234,comment,838685,838685,0,0,Goladus,,,"I disagree.  Quitting a job you've had for several years and supports your current lifestyle is not easy.  It is risky and takes a lot of courage.  That is why others show support.  That support encouraging and valuable to the receiver.  Furthermore, applauding someone's decision is pretty easy, too.  Certainly easier than quitting your job.  So what's the problem?<p>If I say I am building a business in the evenings, do you feel like there will be much value in a one-time round of applause?  Positive effects of your support will be minor, and will wear off long before they affect the outcome of my venture.  Unless you're willing to get interested in my project and show support on a regular basis, or at some critical juncture (eg launch) it's just not that big of a deal.  I certainly wouldn't find applause useful (in fact if you applaud work that isn't deserving I'll find it harmful).  I need criticism, attention, resources, and frequent but pragmatic optimism.<p>On the other hand, if I say I am quitting my job, that means I am going through a rather dramatic change.  Many of the decisions I make and actions I take in the next few days to weeks will make a big difference.  A one-time bit of motivation-- other people letting me know I'm not alone and that my decision can really work out for the best-- can be very significant.",1253714029

839216,comment,838136,838440,0,0,tiffani,,,"Definitely not taken the wrong way.  As a female compSci student, this really did come up as an issue.  I had a friend who was doing great in our program, but after her first internship, she realized compSci was not at all what she was interested in.  She didn't want ""to sit behind a desk all day dealing with a computer"" in the sense of just coming to work writing code.  She did not find that interesting after having done it in the context of a workplace, so @icey really does have a good point.<p>As a woman, I can say a lot of us have a little bit more interest in the people-based aspects of life and for some of us, working with computers all day is off-putting.  A lot of women I know who don't understand what I do all day (writing code), oversimplify and only see the computer and tend to think of me as having a job where I don't interface with people much.  Just that perception (as false as it often is) is enough to be a turn-off and doesn't garner the field much interest.<p>Plus, it's often an issue of exposure why a lot of women aren't as interested in software in the first place.  Before I got to college, I didn't know any other women who wrote code.  My foray into compSci was helped along by an <i>uncle</i> who bought me a programming book for my 15th birthday.  (hehe.)<p>This isn't always the case, but it's difficult to take up something you've never been exposed to.

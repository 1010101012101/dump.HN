Wanna bet it won't?<p>Surface appears heavily inspired by Jeff Han's TED presentation or a Reactable (I am sure both came first). Calling it a shipping product is somewhat of a stretch. It's more like a tech demonstrator you can buy, if they are willing to sell you one and you are willing to pay what they want for it.<p>Call me skeptical, but I am only counting products that you can buy at a computer store or download or use through the web.",1268780385
1197056,comment,1196946,1196946,0,0,ugh,,,"“(…) Facebook may be a bigger success than Google long term (…)”<p>To extend on that: Facebook won’t replace Google. Facebook and Google get so many visits because of different things. Demand for search won’t falter because social networks increase in popularity. I, at least, cannot see how that would be possible.<p>But – just so there are no misunderstandings – Google and Facebook are nevertheless clearly competitors. There is a finite amount of money that will be spent on advertising and Google and Facebook will both be fighting for a large piece that cake. And at some point in the future online advertising will have grown up so that there won’t be always more and more money coming into the system.",1268780362

Google's power is that its ads can be placed anywhere with no action on the user's end to be targeted appropriately. Adsense is totally plug-and-play.<p>To compete with Google, Facebook needs to find a better way to syndicate its ads across the Internet. Unfortunately for them, however, all their advertising power is stuck inside their network. You need to log into Facebook to get targeted ads, which is a huge barrier for Facebook to overcome.<p>We'll see how it plays out, but IMHO Facebook needs to rethink its advertising strategy to even begin competing with the likes of Google.",1268780189

Without even noticing it we are whoring out our privacy and intimate patterns. Google has two customer groups: users and advertisers - and advertisers bring in the money, users are there to maximize advertiser and google ROI - e.g. Google allows pure-ad parked pages, they give tips on ""blending"" ads to increase CTRs etc.<p>If harnessed properly, these things can be useful, but it requires a mindset and workflow not entirely dissimilar to those of spies or high-end criminals - controlling information by selective disclosure, identity segmentation, disinformation, anonymization, etc. - not for sinister purposes, mind you, but simply to guard what we traditionally call privacy.<p><i>written with a one time account</i>",1268779567

You seem to imagine that if everyone had enough food then our economy would grind to a halt; that there would be no commerce anymore. I think this is unrealistic because people will still want 'things'. I might want a larger house to live in, I might dream of owning a Ferrari, you might want to learn to fly a helicopter, someone else might want a new refrigerator. The point is that there are luxuries, as well as necessities, which people will want; it's possible that in this magical hunger-free world people will produce these things and give them away for free, but it seems a lot more likely to me that these things will be available to buy, and that if you want to buy them you will have to go and do some work, to earn some money, to pay for them. And so yes, bankers, really. In a world where you have to pay for things, even if those things are not food, people will want a way to maintain the value of their money, at the very least so that when they're old they'll be able to heat their homes, repair their homes, buy new clothes to wear, afford transport and afford medical treatments.<p>I don't understand your disappointment with this thread, you're taking a line of argument which I find completely fanciful, and which I'm sure at least some others do, where you remove one factor from the world (hunger/the need to eat) and extrapolate to all the ills of the world being cured, with no logic in between.",1268778339

Yes, craftsmanship is necessary to make a good piece of furniture, but if no one designs a good piece, they will just make crap, and make it very well.<p>Another area is movie-making.

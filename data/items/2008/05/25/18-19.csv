Health insurance is going to be relatively cheap.<p>I just signed up for a plan for my wife and I (26/25 respectively), and it's going to cost us around $250/mo with a reasonable deductible, office copay's and prescription coverage.  Dental is an extra $50/mo.<p>The trick(?) for me was to contact the largest insurance company here in my home state (<i>not</i> California) and ask to speak to their small business department.  We built a custom plan rather than using one of their ""off-the-shelf"" plans that most people would pick.  This let me play with the numbers based on our medical history and what we felt we could cover as far as our deductible goes.<p>Really though, call a few of the largest companies and just start walking through the process.<p>One tip -- do it <i>before</i> your current insurance expires.  At least here, if you are currently covered then there is no way they can decline you(?).  The monthly cost may be unreasonable, but they have to at least offer you coverage.",1211741686

That more A's have Nobel Prizes doesn't suggest that I should always pick A's over B's when I need an intelligent person.<p>Also, there are no racial groups for which your average IQs hold.

The way games would need to be developed for that is to build a playable prototype with a team of less than 5 people, and only when that prototype reaches a Miyamoto-level of addictiveness, should it go into full production.

TCP/IP isn't an OSI-modeled protocol.<p>You had it right earlier with the End-to-End Argument. E2E is very meaningful. We shouldn't push functionality into the network that can be handled by the endpoints, because doing that constricts applications and makes the network less useful. Which is why, if applications can shoulder app-layer routing and multicasting, we should embrace that and let them do it.<p>The alternative means getting Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T to buy in to whatever our next-generation app is. Look how well that's worked out so far.",1211740710

199643,comment,198732,198732,0,0,brianm,,,"The key here is to see it from the opposite end -- from the potential employer point of view. We (I am a programmer, but I do a lot of interviewing and general recruity stuff) get metric raftloads of resumes, interest emails, and so on. Most of them are pretty unexceptional to begin with, and most candidates also lie^w exaggerate.<p>In order to find the people you want to hire you <i>have</i> to trim down the ones you talk to by some means. Think of it is a heuristic based search -- it won't be perfect, but it can be very good. You take the traits which correlate highest with success (I will leave success nebulous on purpose, that is a whole other discussion) and start whittling down the search space. A college degree tends to correlate highly with being a good or great programmer, therefore it is frequently used. This is a simplification, of course (though I am sure there are shops which really <i>do</i> this), but there it is.",1211740136

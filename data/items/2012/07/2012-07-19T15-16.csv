4266591,comment,4266496,4266530,1,0,dewitt,,,"Thanks for the link to HTTPS Everywhere.  I recall reading about it at launch, but wanted to understand it better before installing.  IIRC, it uses an explicit whitelist of URLs that redirect from http to their secure equivalent, which gave me pause, as it would seemingly be (theoretically) possible for a malicious party to compromise the whitelist and hijack the redirects.  I could be wrong about the technique of course; I just wanted to wait until I investigated the approach first.<p>Regarding latency, there are many sites, such as www.google.com itself, that achieve low latencies even over SSL.  Given the lightweight nature of HN, I imagine it is at least worth the experiment.  I'm using <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com</a> myself right now, and the latency, if any, isn't noticeable.

4266566,comment,4265830,4266416,10,0,danso,,,"> <i>Do people really think that scientists involved in research with their training are at some kind of disadvantage in solving medical mysteries?</i><p>I'll be brash and say ""Yes""<p>Not because these particular researchers/experts are dumber than those in any other field. But this is a natural psychological state for anyone working within a specialized,  intellectually demanding field: to not be aware of (or not want to care about) any other machinations that happen peripherally to what they're focused on.<p>So, I don't mean that a layperson can walk in and say, ""Hey, I have a hunch if you combine this protein with this chemical and run this lab routine I developed on my own, you'll come up with the cure for cancer."" But a layperson can notice that there may be an information gap between a researcher and a practitioner that results in groundbreaking work being ignored/not implemented correctly, and suggest a process that in itself is groundbreaking. Because a scientific breakthrough is not really useful if it's not actually used.<p>To refer to the ""Checklist"" again, there is nothing on that list that a high schooler could not have thought up him/herself. But do you think its implementation would've been accepted anywhere if someone who was not a doctor had pushed it? Even though a doctor did devise it, it faced considerable resistance.<p>So this is my wild speculation: The medicine field is <i>especially susceptible</i> to the detrimental effects of having blinders. Its practitioners are hard-working geniuses who have well-justified confidence in their processes and insights...but because of that confidence, may be unable to notice blind spots. Moreover, laypeople are unwilling to put in the effort to challenge medicine professionals, because doctors have traditionally such a reputation of being near-all-knowing, and so it's easy to sitback and say, ""Who am I to question them? I didn't go to medical school for 8 years""<p>And this is how the implementation of a sensible checklist that includes steps as simple as ""Wash your hands"" can have a huge impact in modern medicine.",1342713175

Discard support for the dm-mirror was added in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.1.<p>Red Hat also warns that software RAID levels 1, 4, 5, and 6 are not recommended for use on SSDs.

Figure 2 (i.e. a cycle where every edge appears exactly
once). These sequences have the property that every non-
repeating bigram over S (such as sd, dj, fk) appears
exactly once. In order to anticipate the next item (e.g., to
show a performance advantage), it is necessary to learn
associations among groups of three or more items. This
eliminates learning of letter frequencies or common pairs
of letters, which reduces conscious recognition of the
embedded repeating sequence [5].</i>",1342711963

4266379,comment,4266083,4266083,55,0,VanL,,,"The hyperventilating in this article is ridiculous. First, patents always issue on a Thursday - and any large company usually has a number in the pipe. There is nothing unusual about a company the size of Apple getting 25 patents issued in one release.<p>Now, I haven't read all of the 25 patents issued to Apple, but this article makes the classic mistake of confounding the specification (which describes lots of stuff) and the claims (which describe what is protected). Here is what this patent is <i>actually</i> about:<p>1. A method, comprising: at a portable multifunction device with a touch screen display: displaying a portion of an electronic document on the touch screen display, wherein the displayed portion of the electronic document has a vertical position in the electronic document; displaying a vertical bar on top of the displayed portion of the electronic document, the vertical bar displayed proximate to a vertical edge of the displayed portion of the electronic document, wherein: the vertical bar has a vertical position on top of the displayed portion of the electronic document that corresponds to the vertical position in the electronic document of the displayed portion of the electronic document; and the vertical bar is not a scroll bar; detecting a movement of an object in a direction on the displayed portion of the electronic document; in response to detecting the movement: scrolling the electronic document displayed on the touch screen display in the direction of movement of the object so that a new portion of the electronic document is displayed, moving the vertical bar to a new vertical position such that the new vertical position corresponds to the vertical position in the electronic document of the displayed new portion of the electronic document, and maintaining the vertical bar proximate to the vertical edge of the displayed portion of the electronic document; and in response to a predetermined condition being met, ceasing to display the vertical bar while continuing to display the displayed portion of the electronic document, wherein the displayed portion of the electronic document has a vertical extent that is less than a vertical extent of the electronic document.<p>Translated from patent-speak, this just means that the little position indicator along the side of the display indicates where you are in a document. Further claims indicate that the position indicator disappears when you don't do anything for a minute. Anyone who has seen iOS (or Mac OS X Lion) has seen it.<p>If I were Google, though, I wouldn't care about this patent. Why not? Because of the words ""and the vertical bar is not a scroll bar."" These words were added to get around prior art. All Google would need to do is allow its position indicator to <i>also function as a scroll bar</i> and this patent doesn't apply.<p>I am annoyed by patents as much as the next guy - more, even, because I deal with them every day - but this kind of breathlessness helps absolutely no one.",1342711110

4266359,comment,4265364,4265364,7,0,Xcelerate,,,"As a D1 athlete (track & cross-country), I've put a lot of thought into this sort of question.  My conclusion is that sports are inherently unfair.  This may sound like a strange thought coming from someone who has been running competitively for a good portion of my life, but I believe it is the truth.<p>People are born with a lot of genetic variation.  I realize that no matter how hard I train, I will never run 5,000m in less than 13 minutes.  It's not a matter of increasing dedication or anything like that -- it's simply getting the right genes.  Even in high school and college, you see the people with the best genes rise to the top with significantly less effort.<p>So why would I participate in something that rewards luck?  Because it's not entirely luck, and the further away from an elite athlete you are, the less luck matters.  A high school runner with poor innate running ability can easily beat the most gifted runner by working hard and training correctly.  It's because even those born with low potential have a huge <i>range</i> in which they can improve, before they begin reaching their genetic limit.  In fact, I would argue that very few people ever come close to reaching their limit.<p>So I can appreciate that even though there is still an unfairness in how hard different athletes have to work to achieve the same goal, the goal that matters in competition (winning) is really determined by those who are the most dedicated and committed at the more local levels of a sport.  (Of course, we could get into the debate that hard work and commitment are also genetic traits, in which case the whole thing becomes a crapshoot, but I'll leave that question for another time).<p>Now, elite athletes are nothing like normal people.  Almost every single one of them has hit (or is very close to) their genetic limit.  They're at a point where more, or different types of training just won't do anything.  At that point, ""winning"" comes down to a genetic lottery.  Which is kind of sad, because these people have spent their whole lives working for something where achieving it depends mostly on chance.  I assume most of them either don't recognize this or (more likely) don't care.  There is a third option though... recognizing this and fixing it.  This is where drugs come in.  My first thought is that these high performance drugs ""fix"" what was never fair to begin with.  But the problem is that sports weren't designed this way.  When these athletes began their decades of training, they recognized what the rules of the game were.  Like a board game, there's some element of luck and some element of skill.  And because they knew the rules of this game very well before they began competing, I can't condone anyone using drugs to make the game more fair, because the other competitors never agreed to this.<p>Simply put, it's cheating.  And the majority of the world (at least for the moment) thinks cheating is immoral.  So we should continue to ban athletes that don't play by the rules of the game, regardless of the fact that they are trying to make the game more fair for themselves.<p>What are the pitfalls to breaking these rules?  You're cheating all of the other players in the game, who never agreed to let you break the rules.  You're cheating the fans of the game.  You're stealing money (highly competitive sports have large amounts of money involved for the winners).<p>Now, if somebody wants to create a <i>new</i> game, with <i>new</i> rules, by all means go ahead.  I personally wouldn't take an interest in this manner of competing, but I'm sure there are many who would.  And they would be doing it morally.<p>Just my thoughts.",1342710897

He is black, and if you had any idea of what you were talking about, you would realize that 'Abandoned' doesn't reference them being taken care of by the mainstream at one point.  It references the fact that the 'white flight' of the 1950's - 70's is a misnomer.  It was really a middle class flight from cities, but the black middle class was delayed in their ""abandoning"" the inner cities due to racist housing discrimination policies in white suburbs.  Once these were taken away in the 60's, the black middle class also fled the cities.<p>""Ah of course, if only people acted more white they wouldn't have all these problems""<p>This statement is exactly what I'm talking about.  As if there is one 'white' culture in America.  There isn't.  I speak in a different manner at work than I do at home.  My native dialect is not considered acceptable in business.  I don't say y'all or ain't, and I shorten my words into the Anglo-Saxon, northeastern dialect that is the de-facto business standard English of the U.S.  If I don't, I suffer the consequences.  'White' is a race, not a culture.  But again, you completely miss this.  I guess you also think that a black person who speaks in a north-eastern anglo-saxon dialect is 'acting white' correct?  This is such bullshit, and it is the epitome of a person who learned about culture in a classroom, rather than living in a truly integrated environment.<p>My best friend growing up was victimized (physically attacked) by 'Abandoned' kids because he did well in school and 'acted white.'(there words, not mine)  Nice to see this type of thinking isn't limited to just them.  /s<p>The majority of white people I encounter who claim to be multicultural have never even spent the night under the roof of a person of color, let alone attended churches or social gatherings to truly understand that its about culture, not race.",1342710638

It was especially confusing when you heard both of these kinds of things from the same person.</i><p>Experience has taught me that if someone who is clearly smart, who clearly says smart things, says something that sounds dumb to me, it is worthwhile for me to not just dismiss that.  Instead I need to examine my preconceptions for why I disagree, and why they came to the conclusion that they did.  Until I have satisfied myself that I understand both why they thought as they did, and why I disagree, there is a good chance that I'm missing a valuable lesson.<p>This example is a case in point.  Clearly it is from the point of view of a web company.  The advice offered is not for all environments - there is a world of difference between a case where downtime means someone doesn't see a picture for 15 minutes and one where someone dies.<p>Now about unit testing and monitoring, let me give an example.  I know a company (which I can't name) that releases multiple times per day, and releases every change as an A/B test.  This is important.  If they release a change, that works exactly as designed, that hurts conversion by 10%, <i>THEY WILL KNOW</i>.  (You need significant traffic to follow this strategy, they have that.)  This is important.  There are a lot of trivial changes that could move the needle 10% without your realizing, and you don't want to move it in the wrong way.<p>In fact, if you look at the dollar values, a bug that causes 1% of pages to crash which unit testing could catch is simply not as important as a bug that hurts revenue that the A/B test could catch.<p>But it gets better.  If you have 0 tolerance for web pages crashing and have monitoring in place to catch it (I know people who have all crashes email key developers), then you'll catch a lot of bugs that you would catch with unit tests, AND you'll catch bugs that you SHOULD have caught with unit tests but messed up on the test.  Which, then, provided more value, the unit test or monitoring?<p>You want the unit test.  You don't want to be catching stuff after you roll out.  And one of the automatic questions when you do catch it should be, ""How could we have caught that with an automatic test?""  But having smart monitoring is more valuable to you than the unit test.",1342710014

I'm an Emacs guy myself; I haven't used vi(m) a lot, but from all I gather it's a fine editor.  The real ""enemy"", if we need to use war-inspired vocabulary, are editors like nedit, Kate, ScITE, and maybe even Textmate (boy am I going to get told off for this!)<p>Emacs and vi(m) are great editors today, but imagine how much even greater they would be if all those people pouring hundreds and thousands of man-hours into projects like Gedit, JEdit, KWrite, Medit, etc. would have instead put their efforts towards improving the true editors!<p>Disclaimer: I haven't really used those other editors a lot and I'm sure that each of them has something going for it.<p>Also, I know how much fun it is to work on something challenging, like a text editor, even if (or exactly because) there are already established ""solutions"".<p>Finally, a few alternative editors are genuinely useful, such as nano - it might be inferior in pretty much every regard to Emacs, but it's not possible to shrink Emacs to nearly the size of nano so it does seem to serve a valuable purpose for when disk space or memory footprint is an issue.  Cue the Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping jokes.<p>EDIT: and yes, Emacs/vi(m) are not necessarily the be-all, end-all of editors for all time to come; maybe one of those alternative editors will one day prove to be superior.  All those other editors just remind me of the phrase ""Those who don't understand Emacs/vi are condemned to reinvent it, poorly""... err, or something like that.",1293191997

Why would this change?<p>I believe it comes down to culture. If the members of a society are instilled strongly enough with the right values, it isn't necessary for a central body to enforce these values. It would actually be counterproductive. For companies, these values relate to ingenuity, productivity, cooperation, ethics. For countries, the same apply, but replacing a central legal authority also requires strong judicial values. These already exist to an extent. Try punching an old lady on a crowded city street and see what happens to you--it won't matter whether there are police around.<p>Compassion and charity are also necessary. Luckily, in spite of the bad news we see constantly, these values are also quite pervasive in the world. Pervasive enough? I'm not sure. But I certainly wouldn't rule out the possibility that humanity could make great strides in improving its political systems, and perhaps reach a point that would look utopian to our present day, even if it takes a hell of a long time to get there.",1293188865

However striking up conversations with random people does have other (different) benefits;<p>1/ The act of regularly practicing your pitch helps you find holes in the idea - often indirectly. Sometimes people say something off-topic that can make you think ""damn - I should have considered that""<p>2/ Due to the ""Faster Horse"" effect you're unlikely to get decent product insights - especially with some types of consumer products. However, what you can do is get very useful insights into the person's pain points: ""Why are they too busy for a competitors product?""; ""Does the fact they have family abroad suggest previously unconsidered business models?"" etc<p>3/ It helps you become more confident - provided you don't lie. Presumably if you end up only being confident when you lie then before you know what happened you'll become a scam artist!",1293188702

2037060,comment,2036661,2036661,0,0,FooBarWidget,,,"I think all emphasis on server software speed is overrated. In pretty much everything but hello world, the vast majority of the time is spent inside the web app, not in the server.<p>Yes, lowering the web server overhead is a good thing. But I think in most cases it's already so low that further reducing this overhead results in no noticeable impact in real-life scenarios. At some point you'll just be benchmarking how fast the kernel is at doing connect(), read() and write() - in other words how fast your computer can do nothing.<p>For example, let's consider this thought experiment:<p>Someone here mentioned Mongrel2 getting 4000 req/sec. Let's replace the name ""Mongrel2"" with ""Server A"" because this thought experiment is not limited to Mongrel2, but all servers. I assume he's benchmarking a hello world app on his laptop. Suppose that a hypothetical Server B gets ""only"" 2000 req/sec. One might now (mistakenly) conclude that:<p>- Server B is <i>a lot</i> slower.<p>- One should use Server A instead of Server B in high-traffic production environments.<p>Now put Server A behind HAProxy. HAproxy is known as a high-performance HTTP proxy server with minimal overhead. Benchmark this setup, and watch req/sec drop to about 2000-3000 (when benchmarked on a typical dual core laptop).<p>What just happened? Server B <i>appears</i> to be very slow. But the reality is that both Server A and Server B are so fast that doing even a minimum amount of extra work will have a significant effect on the req/sec number. In this case, the overhead of an extra context switch and a read()/write() call to the kernel is already enough to make the req/sec number drop by half. Any reasonably complex web app logic will make the number drop so much that the performance difference between the different servers become negligible.",1293188591

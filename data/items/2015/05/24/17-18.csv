Or Osaka to Tokyo.<p>I haven&#x27;t driven from Boston to Miami in one trip, but I&#x27;ve traversed that entire corridor. My grandparents once owned a few acres on a private lake near Eastford, CT. Lots of cool old dairy-farms, apple orchards, berry-picking, bird-watching, wildlife, <i>et cetera</i>. Most of I95 south of Alexandria is rather boring -- hours and hours of trees -- if you&#x27;re starting by DC it&#x27;s a little more fun to divert along US 301, passing through horse territory and then rolling through Fort AP Hill. More travel time, but on the northern part of the route you&#x27;re more likely to pass the occasional roadside produce stands.<p>The southernmost bits are the ones I&#x27;m less familiar with, though those are possibly the most interesting as in Florida in particular there are places where urban development threatens the most sensitive ecosystems... but the Everglades were never known for agriculture. Agriculture does moreover threaten ecosystems across the midwest (one recent example: monarch butterflies have been suffering massive population drops in the past few years because Roundup-Ready crops have led to widespread herbicide application that kills the weeds that they&#x27;d use for food).<p>But agriculture itself is not under substantial pressure from urban land use at this time. Look, let&#x27;s ask the US Department of Agriculture: <a href=""http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/eib-economic-information-bulletin/eib14.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/eib-economic-informatio...</a> (2002).<p>Urban land, 2.6% of the nation&#x27;s land area.

By December 2002, rates had fallen to $10/hr for Java programming (at my skill level.)<p>A couple of things:<p>1. The first dot com crash also co-incided with the telecom crash (Lucent, Global Crossing, etc) so you had a lot of VERY skilled technologists suddenly hit the market<p>2. The first doc com crash also co-incided with Americans&#x27; ill-fated experiment with whole-sale outsourcing development projects to India which is what caused the huge crash in rates.  As we all know, this was not sustainable as most off-shoring projects at those bottom rates failed.  Rates eventually stabilized once companies realized those rates were too good to be true.<p>3. A lot of developers from Big5 firms also flooded the streets.  I was at Accenture -- we went from 60k employees to 28k.  Rather Andersen went bankrupt entirely.  So you had not only the telecom talent out of work, but also Big5 integrators.<p>Overall, for entry-level employees, it was fine since you weren&#x27;t competing for high salaries.

Unless Rejuvenation Research has an unusual application of the terms &#x27;Received&#x27; and &#x27;Accepted&#x27; (see ref. 1), I&#x27;m more inclined to believe the information on the article page than a general journal policy.<p>Weirdly enough, all the articles in the most recently published edition of Rejuvenation Research (<a href=""http://online.liebertpub.com/toc/rej/18/2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.liebertpub.com/toc/rej/18/2</a>) had at least some gap between receipt and acceptance. I&#x27;m even more inclined to think something unusual has started to happen with the current batch of online-before-publication papers. This could, of course, be a bug with the journal&#x27;s content management system.<p>> Reference 14 is to the SafeSpeed cryopreservation protocol<p>Publishing a reference to an non-peer-reviewed protocol is unusual, irrespective of the details. This is even more unusual when the protocol forms the core of the paper.<p>To be a bit more precise (using details from the paper):<p>Vitrification and slow-freezing are distinct methodologies for preserving specimen. The authors <i>only</i> use two methodologies for preservation, which they explain in the methods section:<p><pre><code>    The cryopreservation methods included worms that were trained and cryopreserved by vitrification and worms that were trained and cryopreserved by slow freezing\n</code></pre>\n> If you distrust SafeSpeed, you can throw out that entire part of the paper and the results are exactly the same: preservation of olfactory memory<p>I think this is part of why my original comment said we should wait for replication and be skeptical. Trust in science is a difficult thing to gain and an easy thing to lose. The choice of journal and the very-unclear description of the cryopreservation protocols make me a bit more skeptical of the results.<p>The SafeSpeed protocol seems to be under review at Nature Methods. If it&#x27;s accepted there, the authors will likely need to supply supporting data which will only bolster the claims they made here.<p>Further, the slow-freezing result is a fairly cheap one to replicate; we&#x27;re likely to see many people try it and they&#x27;ll likely cite Alcor&#x27;s work.<p>> The 30 minutes refers to the traditional vitrification itself<p>I think the authors were intentionally vague in comparing the two preservation methods, especially given how clear the rest of the report is.<p>First, note that only <i>one</i> vitrification technique was used, SafeSpeed. Additionally, only <i>one</i> slow-freezing technique was used, a standard approach that one of your sibling commenters references in passing.<p>The SafeSpeed-vitrified animals were stored in liquid nitrogen (LN2) for 30 minutes and then recovered. This is stated (unclearly) in the methods section (pg 8) and alluded to in the discussion.<p>> 30 minutes refers to the traditional vitrification itself (this is why it&#x27;s &#x27;slow&#x27;)<p>This is counter to what the authors state - they explain that the SafeSpeed method is actually slower than &#x27;slow-freezing&#x27;. See page 11.<p><i>Conclusion</i><p>I think that this will be exciting if SafeSpeed gets published somewhere more reputable. As you alluded to earlier, if there is a physical correlate to benzaldehyde training that isn&#x27;t damaged upon freezing, we&#x27;d definitely expect it to be recovered after freezing.<p>This paper just isn&#x27;t compelling enough to say that we&#x27;ve seen this occur definitively.<p><i>References</i><p>1. <a href=""http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/rej.2014.1636"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/rej.2014.1636</a><p><pre><code>    &#x27;Received&#x27; usually indicates receipt of a manuscript;\n    &#x27;Accepted&#x27; usually indicates the end of scientific edits.\n    Often, articles are held up (i.e., not published online) to coordinate \n    publishing with other labs/projects within a lab.</code></pre>",1432488227

It&#x27;s actually insulting, too, as it shifts blame from those controlling the situation to those executing their will within their constraints. Reality: There were attempts repeatedly to do what&#x27;s truly good for customers from business models to language designs to superior hardware to privacy-preserving technologies. Those companies almost all went bankrupt, got acquired as profit declined, or cancelled those product lines with huge loss ($1+ billion for Intel&#x27;s BiiN and i432 APX). The reason: the market almost always chooses against sacrificing features, time to market, or profit for quality and security. Making it more expensive, slower, less flexible, or less backward compatible for the users own good will get you shunned by consumers or fired by management. Lack of demand is so strong and pervasive, I left the high assurance industry except for private R&D and contracts. I just publish stuff online for free now to help the few that care.<p>On the other end, the users indeed don&#x27;t understand the tech or trust boundaries. What the author missed is THEY... DO... NOT... TRY. Very important. We as a society treat certain things as responsible behavior, mandatory education, or mandatory evaluation. Understanding the tech&#x27;s properties and risks? Not so much. Further, users as a whole are in favor of buggy systems/services that are cheap, free, or used by many friends. They&#x27;re also happy to give away personal information and control for almost nothing in return (eg Farmville). And they outcast, demean, and underpay the people that build all this for them. Software engineer&#x27;s habits and existing products/services are a result of their environment.<p>So, I&#x27;ve always seen the exact opposite: people as a whole and the marketplace need to act responsibly about technology. That will take a learning experience that combines (a) their efforts to learn along with weighing tradeoffs and (b) our best efforts to convert the technical things into layperson level. Metaphors will help as I illustrated [1] for Facebook&#x27;s risk. Further, people need to understand that they get what they pay for, that their decisions create long-term effects on them, and that they might need to invest in ethical/private/quality alternatives to existing services. Fortunately, there&#x27;s always a niche of those customers to serve for developers that care. Hard to get a job, though, since there&#x27;s so few customers and so little money in it.<p>Doing the right thing professionally and in mainstream IT is an approach for those seeking to draw unemployment. Certainly little things you can do within constraints you are given. It&#x27;s just that you&#x27;re effectively working in a straight-jacket trying to help people ordering you to harm them. Most of the time, anyway.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/04/ephemeral_apps.html#c5259463"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/04/ephemeral_app...</a>",1432488030

In some sense, that abstract transience inhibits the feeling of duty that, say, a small town cardiologist feels toward his patients. My grandmother&#x27;s doctor quit medicine after she died of a heart attack. He couldn&#x27;t stand seeing all his friends die.<p>Conversely, there&#x27;s an opportunity here to think about methods to pierce the abstraction.

Know the customer&#x27;s ethical problems (the therapist may be the user, but the hospital is the customer).<p>I hypothesize that the ethical issues are more obvious at the user&#x27;s level.

How much of software ethics in healthcare could be boiled down to &quot;making healthcare easier, one less click at a time&quot;?<p>That&#x27;s where money and abstraction prevents the development of a coherent ethics: why develop ethics when I&#x27;m getting paid and will <i>never</i> get sued.

No one is going to sue the developer that doesn&#x27;t bother to anticipate that the PACS system will eventually be called upon to store digital pathology images also (at 10x the storage per image and 10x the number of images).<p>In fact, no one&#x27;s going to sue <i>the hospital</i> for those things. And the hospital is the customer. So there&#x27;s definitely no path from the nurse or doctor to the software house. Who cares about the intern wearing running shoes at 2 am trying to keep patients alive in 10 different units on 7 different floors in the 3 different wings of 2 hospitals? Nobody.<p>Similar issues could probably apply to roughnecks in the oil industry watching oil blow into the ocean because there&#x27;s no button to override power on the valve, home buyers who are just trying to get their kids into a good school district, etc, etc.",1432487764

Howard did it and got the girl in the end, can&#x27;t you do it too?!?<p>However, my standard for telling a software engineer what is right or wrong (that has serious personal consequences) is to back it up with a $100,000 check in my hand.  This way,  I can soften the blow of any consequences (e.g. his unemployment.)  Since I can&#x27;t do that, my words are just armchair lectures and <i>empty platitudes</i>.   Besides, my words of wisdom are not really necessary.  The software engineers are already morally troubled by it; they&#x27;re just not in an easy position to override their managers.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t have to write questionable software but it&#x27;s because I have the economic ability not to.  My finances allows me to avoid writing software I don&#x27;t agree with so it seems very wrong to use that as a pulpit for moral superiority over others.<p>I think many of the replies are being unfair to the life situation the typical software engineer faces.  The rhetoric comparing the writing of code to optimize bank transactions to gassing the Jews&quot; or &quot;experimenting on babies&quot; is unwarranted.  Yes,  writing code to engineer financials is distasteful but let&#x27;s not get carried away with the counter arguments.

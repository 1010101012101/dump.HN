Better handling to avoid accidents. These things existed in 1996 but weren't present on much of the installed base of cars driven in that year. They were even less common in 1987.

Which there were a lot more of on the road in 1996 than there are in 2013.

Hutchinson, 3 L. J. Ch. 209 (1825), where the plaintiff, a distinguished surgeon, sought to restrain the publication in the 'Lancet' of unpublished lectures which he had delivered as St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London, Lord Eldon doubted whether there could be property in lectures which had not been reduced to writing, but granted the injunction on the ground of breach of confidence, holding 'that when persons were admitted as pupils or otherwise, to hear these lectures, although they were orally delivered, and although the parties might go to the extent, if they were able to do so, of putting down the whole by means of short-hand, yet they could do that only for the purposes of their own information, and could not publish, for profit, that which they had not obtained the right of selling.'""<p>""The common law has always recognized a man's house as his castle, impregnable, often, even to his own officers engaged in the execution of its command.""</i><p>My personal summary and interpretation: privacy is not the formative rational for copyright, patents, etc, and only for-profit imaginary property can be considered to be the subject of infringement since everything else is a mere statement of fact that has already been consensually published (and is therefor also not an invasion of privacy by those sharing and speaking of those facts, at their own expense).<p>The right to privacy has nothing to do with copyright, IMHO.

You are making exactly the opposite of your case.<p>No reasonable person will listen to the deluge of ""treat your Shift Work Disorder with this pill"" and ""solve your Erectile Disfunction"" with this pill and somehow hear ""Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome"" and not think ""yeah... bullshit.""<p>If you want to alter people's idea of normal, don't frame your existence the way people frame diseases and disorders.

It takes the free market ideals and embraces them; the accusations of socialism are more telling of the accuser than the accused. That's not to say that I think health care should be a free market, just that its the goal of the ACA, and the current situation in the US is much less free a market, and due to employer provided insurance, barely a market at all.

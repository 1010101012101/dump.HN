512860,comment,512810,512810,0,0,mixmax,,,"I talked to an old guy that ran a large trucking company some years back, and based on his own experience he gave me the following advice: Never start a business with people that have the same qualifications and interests as yourself. He had once started an unsuccessful trucking company with three other trucking people. The result was that they had amazing trucks that were always in perfect shape, but sales, marketing, finance, and all sorts of other things didn't get done. And they failed. His current company was started with an accountant. So try to find a partner that finds the stuff you're uninterested in interesting.<p>That said, finding a co-founder is hard - you don't know whether it'll work out before you'e tried it. So the best advice is probably to test each other out, maybe by doing a small project first, and seeing how it goes. Additionally you should have a written agrement on what happens if it doesn't work out.<p>And most important of all: Don't take it personally.",1236823182

Had he decided to end his life rather than ride out his illness, I wouldn't have denied him that right. Maybe I would have tried to talk him out of it, but, witnessing how much he suffered, maybe I wouldn't have. I certainly wouldn't have prevented other family members from trying to talk him out of it.<p>I don't know whether Tony's wife and young children were aware of his intentions.

I really was just trying to understand your point.<p>If that is demonstrably false, then please do demonstrate, because I don't believe that for a second if we're talking about the real world and not some abstract ideal government.<p>Governments have a monopoly on the markets I'm allowed to trade in and will jail me if I try to trade outside of their markets, so they clearly provide the platform and law and rules upon which all trade is based.<p>This is to my benefit, without those laws and rules someone could just take my property by virtue of being bigger and badder.  The government is at least the big bad that I have some say in how it's structured rather than some random company which I have no control over.<p>Conservatives like to point out how redistribution of wealth has failed over and over again, but look around man, the entire civilized world is liberal, heavily liberal in American terms, so it certainly has not failed as far as I can see.<p>This idea that America has somehow succeeded where others have totally failed is something I just find absolutely absurd.  Not being number 1 is not failing.  Every other government in the world is not a failure.<p>As far as I'm concerned the measure of the success of a country is how happy it's people are, not how much money it cranks out.

In the meantime it was arguably a rather slow form of GC.<p>Unfortunately the process somehow got wedged in the middle of segfaulting.  We're not sure why and will probably never know. But that meant the process that usually notices when News is wedged and restarts it was unable to kill it.<p>Fortunately rebooting the machine solved the problem.  But now we'll presumably be switching to that new, bigger server sooner rather than later.<p>As far as I can tell it was a coincidence that this happened today.

3765957,comment,3765717,3765919,5,0,unalone,,,"> If they're actually funny (most of the ""That's what she said"" jokes are not), why not?<p>It depends on the audience. I think that sexist jokes are in as poor taste in a workplace as racist jokes would be. I'd also be against black jokes or Mexican jokes or Jewish jokes or jokes about Catholic pedophilia. Even if the extent of the joke was something like ""I'm not going to the pub with you all, I'm such a Jew"", I'd feel uncomfortable; if somebody wrote a bot that was <i>designed</i> to repeatedly make those jokes, I'd be upset.<p>As Jessamyn says:<p>> Now, I admit to having made this joke myself, at times. Once in a while, I even find it funny. What I dont find funny is a bot we have in our general IRC channel at work, that has some basic AI devoted to determining when to interject TWSS into the conversation.<p>And the joke is not that women say funny things while in bed. The joke is, ""Oh, that thing you just said reminded me of fucking a woman."" It's funny in high school when everybody's a virgin, and I've found that as my college friends have gotten themselves laid, it's ceased to become very amusing. The same way I haven't heard a black or Mexican joke in a few years that managed to rise above its racism to become even remotely amusing.<p>Jokes about people having sex can be funny; ""that's what she said"" will always be a joke the brunt of which is the faceless fuck-object woman. Maybe that's fine in moderation, especially if ""that's what he said"" jokes are mixed in, but I think we all agree that if somebody's feeling upset by the jokes, it's not a huge loss to our comedic palettes to have to find another source of humor, right? We're all capable of rising beyond that?",1332939536

You have a database heavy app, SQLAlchemy is more flexible than Django ORM and allows greater SQL expression, Unit of Work etc. Jinja2 is more flexible then Django templates (and faster). Flatland is more flexible than Django forms (supports nested forms for example).<p>That being said, Django is also great for some large apps and just for example it's great for news sites where new types of content is added each day and the admin interface saves a ton of time.

The onboard ethernet chip does in principle support 64-bit DMA, so I was getting all sorts of weird behaviour after upgrading my RAM from 2 to 6 GiB. The southbridge chip in question is now blacklisted for 64-bit DMA in the Linux kernel.<p>The 32-bit DMA cutoff isn't the only such constraint on buffer physical addresses of course; historically, ISA devices could only DMA to 20-bit addresses IIRC (or was it 24 bits?). I wrote an OS X driver for the <i>virtio</i> paravirtual ethernet adapter a while back[2] and its I/O buffers must be 4K page-aligned (low 12 bits 0), and its high bits are specified by a 32-bit number. This means you can only use buffers with physical addresses which fit in 44 bits. That's 16TiB, which are probably still a way off but could conceivably be reached not too far in the future.

It is a perfectly capable typesetting systems, with both advantages and disadvantages over TeX/LaTeX/ConTeXt/etc. The average user will probably want to stick with TeX and friends, but there are situations where Lout is a good alternative.<p>The primary advantages are its very small size and its tight integration with PostScript. The small size means that is very easily deployed (such as when you need something to generate documents); the tight integration with PostScript means that it is relatively easy (assuming you know a bit of PostScript) to augment the output with graphics (I have even, for example, sometimes used Lout to generate EPS diagrams to embed in LaTeX documents). Much easier than using Metafun, for example.<p>The main disadvantages are that it cannot do everything that the TeX engine does and that it has relatively few contributors.<p>For example, there's no way (other than manually inserting column breaks) to automatically generate balanced columns. And while non-rectangular paragraphs are possible in principle (such as for drop capitals or flowing text around images), this generally requires sacrificing hyphenation (and can be non-trivial for the non-expert user).<p>Lout also has fewer people contributing to/using it, so it does not have the rich ecosystem of TeX and friends (e.g., while you can use it to generate slides, there are more and more powerful LaTeX styles available). Integration with bibliography tools and sites (that generally expect/produce BibTeX format) can be another matter.<p>With respect to typesetting quality, it uses the same line-breaking algorithm as standard TeX; it does not have the microtypography features of pdfTeX. For typesetting anything  mathematics (beyond basic math), TeX is generally superior (which should not be surprising, given the effort Knuth put into getting that right).<p>Also, while modifying/creating LaTeX packages these days is not exactly child's play, Lout poses some challenges of its own; its functional typesetting language (used both to describe the content and how that content is laid out via so-called galleys) can be difficult to grasp for a novice.",1332937828

The point of the ""that's what she said"" is to point out when phrases sound like something a woman might have said in bed or during some sort of sexual activity, furthering the already <i>staggeringly</i> vast perception our society has of women as primarily sexual objects. It's not what I'd call ""grossly"" sexist, but if somebody's objecting to it, she absolutely has a reason to feel uncomfortable about it.<p>I disagree that the supervisor is necessary here. First off, that's making an appeal to authority and such appeals can be pretty irritating; second off, that's trying to solve the problem <i>privately</i> rather than in public space. By making this bot, Jessamyn says that her voice is as valuable as anybody else's voice. If somebody else wants to make a bot that makes crude sex jokes, she can make a bot that quotes notable women. And rather than making a bot that's irritating or one-note, it sounds like she made a bot that has a variety of colorful responses, to the point where one of her coworkers told her how much he appreciates it.<p>Remember that sexism is about the reinforcement of cultural stereotypes, rather than being just about gross bigotry or discrimination. What's sexist is that people assume, in a workplace, that jokes about what women say in bed are acceptable. Those jokes make me a little uncomfortable even in a casual environment; it's kind of gross that people are okay with them at work. The sexism isn't one person consciously thinking ""Oh man let's women the butt of jokes about sex!"", it's that women-as-sex-objects is such a pervasive trope that we <i>don't</i> notice it unless somebody like Jessamyn points it out to us.",1332937701

The algorithm was pretty sophisticated as it generated dozens of new domains each day and was trying to contact them on random. E.g. generate 100 domains, try to contact 15 of them, if none responds wait a day. Statistically the bot would get its commands in a 2-3 days (I don't really remember exact numbers so this example might not add up). Well, in order to stop the botnet you'd need to register all available domains out of those 100. So, they were doing just that for some time. They practically blocked the owners operating on the botnet. But they couldn't destroy it. Because that would require manipulating with data on random peoples' computers without their consent which you simply can't (legally). And I think it should stay that way.

I haven't looked into which one was used exactly, but in my experience of working with UN data (of which the WHO is a part), their measurement methodologies are usually quite sound and well-reasoned (of course you can always find something imperfect in the margin, especially for decisions made in the past and that haven't been changed to make it possible to measure change over time, but I'm talking overall). But that's quite a difference from the claimed and unsubstantiated 'totally wrong'.<p>For the second point, I don't think I'm fully understanding. Yes you can use exchange rates as a proxy or second-order measurement for inflation (measurement, not prediction, unless I'm missing something); but I fail to see the relevance of that for the current study, since we're (presumably, again I haven't studied the methodology and more specifically basket used to measure inflation/PPP in that much detail) talking about goods that are relatively little influenced by exchange rates (i.e., much of the consumption of the people on those 2$ budgets is local and based on subsistence farming and local trade).",1332936383

Of course this doesn't really apply to method patents that describe abstract solutions, which is why they are so terrible.<p>> The only possible countermeasure is to have critical patents yourself and play a game of dissuasion, or throw yourself into Mutually Assured Litigation.<p>The spirit of the patent system is not that you can/must form patent pools, but that you are forced to invent a different, and hopefully better, product.  If nobody can come up with an improvement within a limited period of time, then this could be taken as proof that your solution is the best one, and thus everyone should have access to it.  The reward to the inventor is simply part of the mechanism that causes things to be improved, it is not the entirety of it.",1332936381

Project Managers and ScrumMasters are completely different animals. A few times as a coach I have literally thrown the PM out of the stand-ups and told them not to come back because they were turning it into a status meeting.<p>I'm not trying to plug coaching, but if you're trying Agile, you really need an independent outsider to help referee stuff like this.

If I had to narrow it to one specific mis-implementation of agile, it'd be having daily standup meetings turn into daily mini-performance-reviews with the boss.

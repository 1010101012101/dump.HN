1199634,comment,1199335,1199335,0,0,alayne,,,"This is not the first time I've heard this bait and switch tactic. The critical point that is muddled is that the web is not the Internet. Furthermore, an iPhone is a general purpose computing device and not limited to web applications. I don't believe for a minute that HTML5 solves this. For example, a major selling point of the iPhone is its iPod multimedia functionality which is an application.<p>Because you may want to do more with the Internet than access HTTP and because you have a device that does much more than access web pages, control over the applications on that device is a freedom issue. The partial freedom of web access is not the same as actual freedom. If I give the author the benefit of the doubt and believe he isn't clueless, then his spin on reality must be considered deceptive. It's misdirection. To alter a line in the article, when he refuses to distinguish between the Internet and the web and web access freedom and software freedom, he knows what he's doing.<p>I understand you may freely choose to not buy an iPhone, but Apple has gained a certain leverage in the market that can't simply be ignored. As an individual I can ignore it. As a company with competitive interest in mobile applications, you could not easily ignore it.",1268859558

But, there really isn't an opportunity to establish a competitive advantage on the sell side. Competitors will bid up these channels and, importantly, people can figure out how to Google ""buy gift cards"" once you present this idea to them.<p>This business is really about finding a way to get people to sell you gift cards way below face value. But however much PR or advertising you do, most people will just Google ""sell gift cards."" And, again, you will just be doing work for whomever (of the n existing competitors) ranks highest in the SERPs.<p>So if that is the plan, you are really just trying to build another SERP merchant, but have the added complication of having to deal with fraud when sourcing your product (and I don't think fraudsters need to be super clever to walk away with a lot of their money).<p>Hopefully they have a better plan.",1268859475

Here's a summary:<p>* Knew without a doubt he wanted to be an actor. People told him ""you look stupid."" He was thrown out of agent's offices over 1500 times.<p>* Got his first job sitting in the office of an agent overnight. Played a thug that beats someone up for 20 seconds.<p>* Didn't have any money, wife wanted him to get a job, but he wouldn't because ""I knew that the only way I would make it was if it was my only choice.""<p>* Went to the public library one day because it was warm (didn't have money for heat). Started reading an Edgar Allen Poe book, which inspired him to become a writer.<p>* Wrote a bunch of screenplays, still broke. Finally sold one for $100.<p>* Was so broke, he sold his wife's jewelry. That was the end of their relationship.<p>* Couldn't afford to feed his dog, so he sold his dog - his best friend - for $25. 
Later that night saw a boxing match and was inspired to write Rocky.<p>* Was told the screenplay was ""stupid, sappy, etc."" Wrote down all of those things 
and read them the night Rocky won an Oscar.<p>* Was eventually offered $125k for his script. But he demanded to star in it. Eventually after refusing even more money, they agree to pay him $35k and let him play Rocky.<p>* Desperately wanted his dog back. Bought his dog back for $15k and a part in Rocky (for the guy he bought it back from).",1268859231

1199608,comment,1199379,1199379,0,0,spamizbad,,,"I currently have a small office that depends on faxing.  I'd ditch fax if I could, but my clients are funny in their ways.<p>Anyway, I'm using Asterisk 1.6.2 with FreePBX 2.0 and Broadvox is my SIP provider.  My system is set up to receive faxes on the Asterisk PBX and email them to a mailing list of employees (this is configured through FreePBX).  I also have a Grandstream GXW-4004 to provide FXS ports for the fax machine and analog phones that aren't important enough to replace with expensive VOIP handsets.<p>Note: I never got the analog fax machine to send <i>and</i> receive.  Depending on how I set the fax detect on the Grandstream, I could do either-or, but not both.  So my PBX receives faxes and my machine sends them.  This is likely a PEBKAC matter, but I can't really be bothered to put forth the time to work this final gremlin out of my system.<p>My advice to anyone doing faxing over VoIP is the following:<p>1) If possible, don't.<p>2) Make sure your SIP provider supports VOIP faxing.  Some don't with good reason: it's a bitch to support.<p>3) Make sure your SIP provider support G.711 with T.38.<p>4) Make sure your ISP does not strip QoS headers (In this case DiffServ EF)from IP packets. Your ISP will ignore them, obvious, but you definitely don't want them stripped or overwritten.<p>5) Make sure your VOIP packets have a DiffServ EF value in their headers.<p>6) Make sure any router(s) and switch(es) are configured properly to give top priority to your VOIP traffic.  Failure to do so will likely result in jitter on your calls and you'll be unable to successfully send/receive faxes.<p>7a) If possible, don't run your <i>primary</i> PBX in a virtualized enivornment.  Competition for system resources may create unwanted latency on your Asterisk VM resulting in jitter and failed faxes.<p>7b)With that said, I would definitely keep a cold or hot ""spare"" PBX running in a VM to spin up in the event of an outage.<p>Good luck!",1268859091

Nobles only had about an average amount of surviving children while rich merchants had an above average one.

My cousin is one of the top ranking pool players, a game which has a following of around 130 million. Pool, as a sport, is looking to inject more money into the game and I thought, hold on... 
1. pool application with ranking system
2. every time someone plays v a friend they can add themselves to that ranking on smartphones which is connected to every other player. Cheats can be possibly thwarted via a 'ladder system' where you don't go up unless you play someone of equal ranking outside of friends (this is the tricky bit but you can find a way!)
3. If he, along with the rest of the elite backs this application and we somehow link them in then we have a potential winner right?
4. It can possibly be monetised via small bets (although this possibly clashes with gambling laws)<p>If anyone is interested then I'll put you in touch. I don't know where it will go but Pool is looking for a winning model since the money went out of the game in 2006 after USA gambling laws changed. Email me on p.kullar@gmail.com if you're looking for startup ideas. I'll certainly make introductions and you never know where these things can go.<p>Actually, I might be being friggin dumb here but life is short.",1282608638

It seems like EVERY SINGLE YC startup is being featured on Techcrunch.<p>Being a YC funded company is notable in the same way that being funded by any top tier angel or VC would be.  It is the same reason why every publicly launched company invested in by Chris Sacca, Jeff Clavier, Ron Conway, Dave McClure, etc is covered on TechCrunch and other tech blogs.  TC also routinely covers companies coming out of Techstars and other well known early stage investment programs.<p>It may seem like YC gets more coverage, but I think it is roughly proportional to the number of companies that YC funds.

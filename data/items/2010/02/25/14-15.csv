I too tend to prefer the older iterations of games over the newer.  even when the game play mechanics are less refined, the older games just often have this character to them that I suspect comes from having smaller development teams.",1267109708
1150729,comment,1147670,1150432,0,0,Silhouette,,,"> If I want to express, say, a dissenting political opinion, I may want to be anonymous, and I may not want to pass the burden of accountability to someone else.<p>I am certainly not saying that <i>no</i> protected speech should exist. Indeed, I am all in favour of a law that protects certain classes of speech, with political views probably the most important class.<p>I just think that such laws should be crafted carefully, striking a balance between freedom of expression and protecting people from the harm when others abuse that freedom, and that once such laws have been made, they should apply on the Internet as much as anywhere else.<p>There are complications with jurisdiction in the on-line world, but there is no reason that most of the international community can't reach a consensus on these issues, just as they have on many others before.<p>I have always struggled with the idea of anonymity as a vehicle for free speech, for three reasons. Firstly, most people who think they are anonymous on-line really aren't, if someone tries hard enough to identify them, so it is often an illusion. Secondly, actively protecting anonymity automatically removes any responsibility from the speaker, whether or not what they are saying is within a protected area, creating a huge loophole in the laws. Finally, while anonymity may have a perceived value in protecting those opposing an undemocratic government, we don't have that situation anywhere in the west (to the point where political dissidents are routinely threatened or ""disappeared""), and if we ever reach that point again, the correct response will be one of the three boxes after ""soap"".",1267109564

1150723,comment,1150523,1150669,0,0,ramchip,,,"It's not all about optimization. Take Starcraft: I like the characters, the gradual development. Japanese strategy games sometimes even have more content than actual novels (for example, the Galaxy Angel series are all visual novels with Homeworld-style space combat interspersed in the story). I like discovering the new buildings, seeing new units, watching a volley of missiles being shot, feeling like the armchair commander as reports from other characters come in :)<p>Although I like chess as well, after a long day, I find it much more relaxing to watch the tank driver take position and blow up a bunch of zergs, than to think about abstract units like a rook.<p>I must say I don't like most modern strategy games however... I'd much rather play Settlers III than Settlers 7, the original Stronghold over Stronghold 2, or civ 2 over civ 3. Somehow the transition from isometric to full 3D made the game much harder to control for me, and I prefer good drawings to 3D renderings. Japanese games are still very 2D-based though so I play a lot of them. YMMV.",1267109335

1150717,comment,1150523,1150669,0,0,allenp,,,"While the ""math"" of strategy games are typically exposed (and with it the ability to optimize) - the fun of strategy games is to balance competing demands by making decisions with long-term consequences. The difficulty with creating strategy games is to make something replayable that isn't formulaic. I think the Civ series has succeeded so far because of its ability to introduce enough chaos that no single pattern of game play will always win no matter what.

Thankfully the bubbles are broken down by specific health claim (so that some supplements have several bubbles for their effect on different conditions), but to determine ""worth it,"" they need to include:<p>1. Some sort of way to account for type and frequency of side effects. For example if everyone who takes the supplement gets an intolerably bad taste in their mouth, that's a mild but prevalent side effect. If one person in 100,000 who takes the supplement dies, that's a comparatively rare but very serious side effect. This factors heavily into the ""worth it"" determination, because risk is a consideration.<p>2. Cost. If a supplement has a mild beneficial effect but costs $1,000 a month, I'm not sure most people would say it's ""worth it.""<p>3. Strength of effect. A statistically significant improvement is not necessarily clinically significant. For example, with a large sample a 1% decrease in LDL cholesterol may be statistically significant, but it is not clinically significant.<p>Those factors would help a person determine the pros and cons effectively. What is ""worth it"" varies considerably from person to person.",1267108642

1150666,comment,1150529,1150529,0,0,sparky,,,"This seems like as good an opportunity as any to start a discussion: what do people think about these software cost estimation models and tools?  They seem like a valuable tool for communicating the value of working software to non-technical businesspeople, but any programmer knows that the value, complexity, or cost to reproduce software is a function of much more than SLOC count.<p>For instance, the SLOCCount tools use the COCOMO model (<a href=""http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/sloccount.html#cocomo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/sloccount.html#cocomo</a>), whose follow-on COCOMO II is discussed here (<a href=""http://csse.usc.edu/csse/research/COCOMOII/cocomo_main.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://csse.usc.edu/csse/research/COCOMOII/cocomo_main.html</a>).  These models use factors like the following to calculate an exponent which is applied to the SLOC count to estimate cost to produce:<p>Required software reliability\n	Database size\n	Product complexity\n	Execution time constraint\n	Main storage constraint\n	Virtual machine (HW and OS) volatility\n	Computer turnaround time\n	Analyst capability\n	Applications experience\n	Programmer capability\n	Virtual machine experience\n	Programming language experience\n	Use of ""modern"" programming practices (e.g. structured programming)\n	Use of software tools\nRequired development schedule<p>Are these the right factors?  How are they suited to estimating the cost to produce or reproduce a piece of software?  What would you add?<p>It seems like some measure of the cyclomatic complexity of a codebase, or the number of syntactic elements, might add some information to the raw SLOC count.  Arguably this doesn't tell you much about how much it might cost somebody to reimplement it (since that person might come up with an easier-to-code-and-maintain variant with lower cyclomatic complexity or in a more powerful language), but it might help estimate the cost to get it working in the first place.",1267107256

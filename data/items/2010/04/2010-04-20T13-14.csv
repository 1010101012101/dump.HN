1279393,comment,1279347,1279347,0,0,SlyShy,,,"General principle: short sentences convey speed, long and meandering sentences will give the reader a sense of drawn out time. A pitfall many writers fall into is over describing their action scenes, which makes them seem oddly sluggish and dull.<p>The revision shown in the article to ""A Bad Uncle lifted Captain Samson over his head and hurled her over the edge of the catwalk,"" is an example of this problem. The reader knows how you throw someone, they don't need an explanation.<p>""The Bad Uncle hurled Captain Samson over the edge."" (Presumably the reader knows they are on a catwalk, too, so ""the catwalk"" is unnecessary.)<p>If it is really important to convey that the Bad Uncle is very strong you could do ""The Bad Uncle hurled Captain Samson over his head, off the catwalk,"" or something similar.<p>Edit: Also, the article discourages adverbs, but doesn't mention that adjectives are similarly bad. Most adjectives can be better conveyed through an action or specific detail. Don't say ""she was nice"", but do show her helping a lost child.",1271771963

First, the local banks are /far/ more conservative with loans.  There is no rush to jump on the next big thing and they do not hand out loans, sometimes even when thy are well deserved.  It is pretty old school.  You have to really prove what you say, and if they don't understand it, no way in hell are they loaning any money to it. Frustrating at times and in some ways short sighted, but you don't have everyone scrambling to make a quick buck (and the banks financing it all) either.  IOW, the position Texas enjoys is only tangentially affected by the state gov't.
2nd -- I personally don't like Rick Perry and I was foaming at the mouth when he cut education funding but, tough as the cuts were there and in other places,  Texas has a surplus.  There is wiggle room.  I have to grudgingly admire that kind of discipline.

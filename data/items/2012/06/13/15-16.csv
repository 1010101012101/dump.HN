Does the app break if I don't get it?  Does the quality of the app diminish?  Is there some measurable way in which this impacts me negatively?<p>- Can I rely on this?  Can it be verified?  If a user enters his name as ""Pinocchio Dandelion"", can I say that it isn't?  At this point, if it IS incorrect, refer back to question #1.<p>By my estimation, generally, if you're asking for names, and it matters, you should probably also be asking for credit card information, or some other way to vet that data.  If you aren't expecting to bill them, you probably don't need to ask for it.<p>Of course, you might have something in the app that does need it that we can't see from the outside, but most commonly in these scenarios is that people <i>think</i> they need the information and really don't, which means that you might have captured an even larger percentage of users in the signup funnel.<p>In regards to signups, you really really really want to make it as frictionless as possible.  Once you have their email address, you almost certainly have a more 'committed' user than someone who hasn't filled out the form at all.  If first and last names are nice for you to have (but not strictly necessary), then you can ask for them later, after you have their email address.<p>Once you have the email address though, that gives you the ability to try and lure them in further.  Patio11 (as usual) has more detailed information on this topic, so I'll refer you to his posts as to why having an email address is a really good thing, but suffice it to say, it is.",1339603090

4106590,comment,4102248,4104281,1,0,pessimizer,,,"They adjust IQ scores for income? I missed that.<p>It has nothing to do with political correctness - it was literally the purpose of general intelligence tests to justify exclusionary immigration, racism and eugenics, and they were designed (or redesigned in some cases, such as when blacks in the military scored better than whites) to do that well. It reified a general intelligence concept that has no actual evidence, and justified that with factor analysis, the leading tool of statisticians for creating a single thing out of a maelstorm of complicated, interdependent factors by just pretending that they are linear.<p>See: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mismeasure_of_Man"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mismeasure_of_Man</a><p>IQ tests correlate far higher with pleasure reading in childhood than any other factor IIRC.<p>This is not sour grapes - I'm a member of MENSA (which is really a boardgaming club); it's just historically accurate. IQ tests could be completely replaced with a tally of books read for pleasure (and the reading level of those texts), and you would end up with all of the same correlations without all of the self-important mathy-sciency tone.<p>I accept that there's a difference in the amount of knowledge that people have accumulated, and the amount of familiarity about how to evaluate common classes of questions that a voracious reader will have seen a million times before, and that a lack of those things may create a lot of challenges in college. I have no issue with the SAT. My issue is with the completely unjustified leap to a belief of differences in capacity, and the projection of this onto reified folk theoretical (theory-theory) internal states. This mythology is just another cultural construct to separate humans into ""us"" and ""the others"" and to alleviate the cognitive dissonance between our proclaimed ethics and open prejudice. Being a measure of the status quo, primarily, it serves solely to perpetuate it, offering no other benefit.<p>edit: early intelligence tests actually had questions that assumed you knew details about current baseball teams.<p>edit2: I also noticed that, other than reading for pleasure, the other examples that you listed for high correlation with IQ are degrees of adherence to cultural norms.

Let me expand on my comment.<p>I think this is a brilliant idea, and it seems to be well executed. I don't have the necessary hardware to run it, so I haven't played with it, but it looks to be a wonderful game based on algebraic manipulations.  I, along with everyone else, expect and hope that it will engage players and allow them to learn the rules and skills of such manipulations.<p>And probably that's a good thing.  Let me try to explain the underlying reasons for my sense of unease, as best I understand them.<p>Firstly, I am concerned that this will merely enhance the sense that math is simply arbitrary manipulations with neither meaning nor motivation. Many of the kids I tutor can do the manipulation, but don't get the point, and never connect it with reality.<p>Next, some of the kids I tutor can't do the manipulations without making stupid errors, and I can't help but feel that even after practising with this, they will still make stupid errors. Link that to the apparent meaninglessness, and there's a recipe for frustration.<p>Thirdly, this doesn't help to connect the creation of equations with the physical problem to be solved, and it doesn't help interpret any final answer.  These are the steps that the kids I deal with simply can't do.<p>Finally, as someone commented, this isn't intended to be the whole and entire course, and it's supposed to be just one tool to help one stage, and to be built on and leveraged by the teachers. I've lost count of the number of wonderful tools and ideas that I've seen whither and die because the teachers can't make use of them. In some cases the teachers don't really understand them, but I would hope that fate would be avoided by this.<p>So in summary, I think this is a wonderful tool, and it has the potential to be a fantastic aid to learning.  I am deeply uneasy about the further divorcing of algebraic manipluation from any sense of meaning, but I look forward with interest to see if it can be used in a meaningful way.",1339602783

I mean, what if I'm recording my friend's party in the park and you trip in the background.  Am I allowed to upload the video?  Do I have to edit you out first?  What if I upload the video figuring you're anonymous in it, but then a friend of a friend recognizes you and edits out just the highlights?  This argument can be carried to extremes; I just prefer to draw the line at public spaces are public, which even if it's not the best demarcation, is at least fairly black and white.<p>Regardless of that, I was talking about monitoring, not broadcasting.  If the police cameras record what happens on every street corner and the video is archived for potential review, I think that's quite different than live streaming to the internet.  Almost all of these arguments hinge on the police watching something, and then <i>doing</i> something unpleasant.  Maybe the doing is inevitable, but I don't think that's a foregone conclusion, so therefore I also don't think such what if scenarios are slam dunk indictments of monitoring itself.",1339602716

Such focus allows you to gain ""comparative advantage"" and to easily do things that are difficult for people who don't have your deep experience. In other words, it is better to spend your efforts trying to become the world's greatest Python hacker than to jump on the bandwagon of every new programming language that comes out and ending up as a ""Jack of all trades, master of none.""<p>My conclusion: I do think it is worthwhile to challenge yourself not to just stick to what you already know (which in my personal experience is VERY easy to do especially if you find that you're very productive using what you know). But you also have to be selective. Life is too short to try to be a master of everything. And there is great value in gaining a very deep expertise in a particular topic or technique.</i><p>I've come to the conclusion that, if possible, it's best to be a ""jack of all trades, master of <i>one</i>"". It may take longer, or you may never truly attain mastery, but being flexible and not just willing, but eager to push yourself to learn new and different things is always a good thing. If nothing else, find something you enjoy enough to get enough skill in to pay the bills and then play with other things in your spare time.<p>This is particularly interesting to me, because while I find I <i>could</i> become obsessed with something enough to attain deep mastery, I find there are so many awesome things to learn and play with that I don't want to miss out on them. This could explain why I didn't go to grad school (and go on to become a professor, a once dream of mine) and haven't founded my own startup, but instead prefer to languish at a 7-4 day job with the government and sample everything from robotics to music to cooking to search and rescue in my spare time. To be sure, I still push myself at the job (it's funny you specifically mention C++ and Python: I'm finishing up Coplien's Advanced C++ while delving back into Python for the robotics as well as smartphone/tablet programming, and Go has also piqued my interest). The one limiting factor to try and keep me focused is that I try to keep my learning to tools that are open source, so as not to suffer from lockin and platform obsolescence.

In vacuum, an object will radiate until it reaches absolute zero; in air, however, you're constantly being heated to the ambient temperature, meaning you can't radiate your way down until the air has lost its heat too.<p>The thing I think you're not taking into account is that this device has the effect of slightly increasing your black-body radiation. So you're at 1300K, radiating at 1300K, but we apply a little electricity and you start radiating a little more-- maybe you now look like you're at 1301K. Your heat hasn't actually increased, just apparent radiation, and as a consequence you cool down a little faster than your black-body profile would suggest.<p>So say you're at room temperature, radiating at room temperature, being warmed by the air, and not losing any heat. We apply current again, and you start radiating at a little over ambient temperature. The air is still warming you, but you're cooling a little faster than before, with the extra heat being deposited wherever the radiation is absorbed. To the air, you now feel cool.<p>Why should the absolute temperature of the ambient air have an effect on the process?",1339602182

I am wary of rewarding the brain with in-game loot for memorizing the rules of algebra rather than with the deep satisfaction that comes with understanding.  Obviously, this latter type of reward cannot be as consistently provided and requires a certain maturity (maybe), but ultimately I think it's what drives most insightful people.<p>Here's a good example of what bothers me:<p>>As the game progresses, youll start seeing cards that are above and below each other, with a bar in the middle  and youll learn to cancel these out by dragging one onto the other, which then turns into a one-dot. And youll learn that a one-dot vanishes when you drag it onto a card its attached to (with a little grey dot between them). These, of course, are fractions  multiplication and division  but you dont need to know that to play the game, either.<p>That last sentence is especially telling.<p>To me, gamification is suited for making necessary but painful tasks fun (e.g. cleaning your desk, tagging media, memorizing facts), but not for deep learning (e.g. algebra, quantum mechanics, object-oriented programming).

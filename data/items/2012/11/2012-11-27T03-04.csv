</code></pre>
There's a difference between ownership of an idea, and plagiarism. An example of trying to 'own' an idea would be:<p><pre><code>  1) Person A creates an idea
  2) Person B independently creates the same idea (or
     something extremely similar).
  3) Person A attempts to assert control over the idea
     by dictating what Person B can or cannot do with it
     based on the fact that Person A 'got there first.'
</code></pre>
An example of plagiarism would be:<p><pre><code>  1) Person A creates an idea.
  2) Person B copies Person A's idea, and attempts to claim
     independent creation (or attempts to claim creation prior
     to Person A).
</code></pre>
The real difference is that with plagiarism, Person B is committing a fraud about the source of the idea. It's more about authorship than anything else. Even in a society where you couldn't own an idea, you could still have authorship as the first person to think of something.",1353988545

The feeling of an insurmountable huge project when you're tired after a long day isn't exactly motivating.<p>Some other suggestions (I've a similar work style):<p>- Try the morning instead of evening, slowly dial back your wakeup time until you have 2 hours in the morning instead of evening (and correspondingly go to bed earlier; this is important!). Doesn't work for everyone, but perhaps try it for a week - I find the switch invigorating. Do other stuff in the evenings - chores, laundry, art, errands, cooking.<p>- Figure out if there's anything you want to learn or practice, instead of tackling hard problems straight away. Perhaps allot yourself 30 minutes of learning and then see how your brain feels for real work.<p>- Make yourself accountable for finishing stuff. Pair up with a buddy who has the same problem, enter a competition or whatever works for you. One of the accountability tricks I used was to set a deadline to make myself fluent enough in iOS development by the date of an upcoming hackathon. For those of us with ADD or ADD tendencies, deadlines can really help that ""I never finish anything"" feeling. A buddy who you can set up a regular chat time with is also a really awesome way of getting stuff done.<p>- Exercise for 20-30 minutes, even if it's a walk outside in the crisp night air. Taking an evening shower can also help - think about your project in the shower, you might get some ideas and feel inspired.<p>- Find what works for you to set the 'focus' mood. Different lighting, herbal tea, a clean desk, binaural music - get your favourite focus triggers ready and only use them for this period.<p>- Leave yourself red. Don't wrap up your project neatly every night, but leave something dangling (and small) to fix the next day. That way you know exactly what you have to do first when you open up your text editor.",1353988256

I don't even know where to look to find answers to these:<p>* If I split() a string, does each piece get its own BOM?<p>* If I copy-paste text characters from A into B, what encoding does B save as?  If B isn't a text editor, what happens?<p>* If a chr(0x20) is part of a multi-byte escape sequence, does it count as a space when I use .split()?<p>* When it encounters right-to-left, does the renderer have to scan the entire string to figure out how far to the right it goes?  Wouldn't this mean someone could create a malicious length-n string that took O(n^2) time to process?<p>* What happens if I try to print() a very long line -- more than a screenful -- with a right-to-left escape in a terminal?<p>* If I have a custom stream object, and I write characters to it, how does it ""know"" when to write the BOM?<p>* Do operators like [] operate on characters, bytes, 16-bit words, or something else?<p>* Does getting the length of a string really require a custom for loop with a complicated bit-twiddling expression?<p>* Is it possible for a zero byte to be part of a multibyte sequence representing a character?  How does this work with C API's that expect zero-terminated strings?<p>* If I split() a string to extract words, how do the substrings know the BOM, right-to-left, and other states that apply to themselves?  What if those strings are concatenated with other strings that have different values for those states?<p>* What exactly does ""generating locales"" do on Debian/Ubuntu and why aren't those files shipped with all the other binary parts of the distribution?  All I know about locale generation is that it's some magic incantation you need to speak to keep apt-get from screaming bloody murder every time you run it on a newly debootstrapped chroot.<p>* Is there a MIME type for each historical, current, and future encoding?  How do Web things know which encoding a document's in?<p>* How do other tools know what encoding a document uses?  Is this something the user has to manually tell the tool -- should I be saying nano thing.txt --encoding=utf8?  If the information about the format isn't stored anywhere, do you just guess until you get something that seems not to cause problems?<p>* If you're using UTF-16, what endianness is used?  Is it the same as the machine endianness, or fixed?  What operations cause endian conversion?<p>* Should my C programs handle the possibility that sizeof(char) != 1?  Or at least check for this case and spit out a warning or error?<p>* What automated tools exist to remove BOM's or change accented characters into regular ones, if other automated tools don't accept Unicode?  Once upon a time, I <i>could not</i> get javac to recognize source files I'd downloaded which had the author's name, which included an 'o' with two dots over it, in comments.  That was the only non-ASCII character in the files, and I ended up removing them; syncing local patches with upstream would have been a nightmare.  Do people in different countries run incompatible versions of programming languages that won't accept source files that are byte-for-byte identical?

It's a terrible crime.<p>Now imagine a man kills a woman -- his daughter.  Most people's gut reaction is that this is a worse crime than the previous example, because a parent he has a moral duty to protect his child.<p>Likewise, a country is supposed to protect its citizens -- so killing its own requires a stronger justification than killing non-citizens.<p>I'm not going to take the discussion off-topic by taking a position on the circumstances under which it's justifiable for a country to kill its own citizens or non-citizens.  I'm just saying that a country's justification for killing its own citizens needs to be <i>at least as strong</i> -- and usually <i>stronger</i> -- than its justification for killing non-citizens.<p>[1] This paragraph is completely off-topic.  ""All human lives are equally important"" sounds like a good and simple axiom for a value system.  But it's interesting to try to think of situations where any of several people could be sacrificed to prevent some great evil, and the group figures out reasons to sacrifice some person or people with certain characteristics in preference to others.  For example, ""save the women and children first"" is often said in disaster movies -- which implies their lives are somehow more valuable.  Based on this anecdotal evidence, it appears that real human value systems often don't follow this axiom.",1353985589

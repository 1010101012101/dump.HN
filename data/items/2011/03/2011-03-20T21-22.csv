Which would be identical to an iPod Touch in every way except for being scaled up 30% (including in pixel size) -- like the Nintendo DSi XL.<p>Target market for this device would be people like me -- i.e. over 45s with presbyopia/fat finger, who want a physically slightly larger device with the same UI and apps as the iPod Touch. A secondary market would be ebooks: the iPhone/iTouch screen is just too small to be comfortable, but a larger screen at the same (retina display resolution) with larger UI elements but scaled text (to display more of it for reading) would be fine. Scaling up the compact iOS interface (iPhone/iTouch) doesn't require redesigning apps in the same way that scaling down the iPad UI would; you can use a small app on a larger screen, it's going in the other direction that's painful.<p>I suspect the BOM for a larger iTouch would be insignificantly costlier than a regular iTouch, so this would permit them to hit the $300 price point without cutting their margins significantly.",1300658232

I work as a consultant for a public medical IT company so I've seen first hand just how much work it takes for a hospital to upgrade their software. Besides a strong product and sales team, there's a ton of training and support that is required for a hospital to successfully convert to a new system.<p>It looks like DrChrono's target market is smaller physicians offices, which I'm not as familiar with (I consult with larger hospital systems). If DrChrono can successfully demonstrate how their software can eliminate errors, improve efficiency, and save doctor's offices money in the long run, then they will have a good chance, but there are a number of things they need to execute correctly in order to succeed.<p>Training and support are VERY important for a successful switch to new software. Physicians and nurses are typically older and not as technically savvy as the people who develop and sell the software. They do not like change because they are used to their workflow with their paper-based systems, and I've seen firsthand projects that took a turn for the worse because the hospital executives decided to make the switch to new software and the physicians and nurses did not like the change to their current workflow.<p>DrChrono also needs to be flexible enough to cater to the different workflows and reporting needs of each physicians office. This is definitely not a ""One software fits all"" market. What may be a perfect fit for one physician may not meet the needs of another office.<p>Summary: This is a tough market to be successful in because of so many factors, but that doesn't mean that it can't be done.",1300657941

2347477,comment,2344837,2347344,0,0,barrkel,,,"There are many things that make it fast - or rather, it's the lack of slow things that make it fast. Excessive recursion during parsing is one of those things that is avoided (and that was what was on-topic here). Your focus on binding is instead a focus on something that another compiler does particularly slowly. That a different compiler is fast is not due to it being fast at binding specifically; it's due to being fast, or at least not slow, at almost everything.<p>Delphi does indeed inherit unit syntax from Turbo Pascal. This is both a blessing and a curse; it makes writing well-structured programs easier by enforcing a logical consistency in ordering (programs more or less have to be written in a procedurally decomposed way), but it also makes writing programs with complex interdependencies between parts more awkward. The unit format is also one of the things that makes the compiler fast (or not slow); relinking a binary unit based on a partial compile is very quick, and as it's not a dumb C-style object format, the compiler can be intelligent about dependencies. Every symbol has a version, a kind of hash, associated with it, computed from its type, definition, etc. When units are relinked after a recompile of a unit, only the symbols need be looked up and their versions compared; if there is no version mismatch between imports and exports, then dependent units don't need recompilation.<p>Random factoid: the guy who wrote the original source for the current Delphi compiler was also one of the developers for the .NET GC, and CLR performance architect (Peter Sollich).",1300656840

If you want to read that much of it, check it out for yourself.<p>Excerpt:<p><i>Create/Invent Exactly What You Want<p>If you can envision something that doesn’t yet exist, something you have a distinct need for, then you may be on to something.  If you can create it — whatever it is — and use it to positive effect (enjoyment, efficiency, whatever) then you might have something that could really take off.<p>Paul Graham discusses how this idea relates to technology startups in this essay, but there are ways to apply it beyond starting a company, or creating a product or service.  Following your own taste, rather than what you imagine other people will like, is also the best way to proceed in artistic pursuits.  This might sound obvious, but most entrepreneurs and artists don’t apply this principle.  Instead, they pander to what they believe the public wants, or what they believe will be a commercial success.  This strategy might slightly increase the odds of mild success in the short-term, but it will squash any chance of wild, break-out success (black swan success).  For that, you need to invent (or create) for yourself.</i>",1300656750

2347403,comment,2346350,2346350,0,0,MDX,,,"As someone who is a designer/developer who also runs several successful e-commerce websites here are my 2 cents:<p>Stay away from sites like 99designs and other low budget crowdsourcing sites as they only attract low quality designers who tend not to know much about UX, conversions, usability, perception, etc.<p>If this project is serious enough for you to quit your job then you really need to make sure your design is going to be flexible enough to accommodate all of the changes you may need to make in order to increase conversions as you begin to acquire customers and analyze data.<p>Here is my suggestion: the designer should create a design that fits within a CSS grid framework like 960.gs, Blueprint or the Less Framework. The designer can also create their own grid and you can generate the CSS using several online CSS grid builders like the 1kb grid.<p>Then figure out how many UNIQUE page templates you will actually need (things like a home page, a pricing page, a general inner page that can also double as a blog page - if designed correctly, and a signup page - it's very important to have a flexible signup page that you can easily make changes to).<p>Most likely you will be re-using elements like headings, paragraphs, sidebars, menus, buttons and lists throughout your site. You can use the CSS grid to build multiple layouts for different page templates or sub-page templates and then reuse the elements and their styles for the content of those pages.<p>If you need help get in touch. We do a lot of design and dev work for startups and this sort of thing (flexible interface design at a reasonable price) is something we do all the time. Heck, we may even build the templates using HTML and CSS right in the browser and skip the PSD files altogether!<p>My website is on my profile page. Our pricing is very reasonable and we're located in the U.S. - Detroit, Michigan to be exact.",1300655031

Couple that with insider information and you can short a stock then release overly pessimistic information. Worse yet, you can decide to delay a product's release for the same effect etc.<p>Think: <i>Pfizer is considering pulling Viagra from the market in response to a possible side effect.</i> then next week <i>After, a full review we find no evidence that any such effect exists.</i>",1300654925

Now, there may be usability reasons for going with different database technologies, but from the lack of panic in your post, it sounds like you're doing fine.<p>(Incidentally, if you've got data problems that aren't being satisfied by SQL queries, then you could probably get a really interesting discussion going if you wrote about it.)",1300654824

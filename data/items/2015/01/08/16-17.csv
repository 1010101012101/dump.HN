8857280,comment,8854264,8855385,0,0,EC1,,,"As long as we have internet, we will be complacent. I believe the internet has fragmented our minds so far and wide that with it, nothing will ever get done. The internet is the worst invention of the 20th century. I wish the internet was regulated purely for education, not gaming, not buzzfeed, or facebook, or any such bullshit distractions.<p>If interests were kept local, issues would become local, and communities form. The internet allows us to pick and choose our own communities, so while we&#x27;re together, we&#x27;re further apart than ever. We&#x27;ll never have a common localized goal.<p>If we live on the internet, we do our &quot;activism&quot; on the internet, our communications, our entertainment, everything.<p>Until either the internet dissolves or becomes regulated/boring, and/or the governments policies physically affect us, nothing will ever happen.<p>I remember as a young boy my Grandmothers only wishes her entire life was to dip her feet in the ocean and see a mountain in person.<p>Our desires became more contrived with the endless information stream we experience every day. There&#x27;s no communities. There&#x27;s no real passion or ideology anymore. Just cynicism, ego, competition, and sarcasm.<p>The internet lets you vicariously live through every body, and we lose that essence of what it means to be human, the passion to discover what is unknown.<p>Once you are exposed to how truly chaotic everything really is, that everything operates under the illusion of a master plan but is really just one headless blunder, you realize you are completely helpless and stop caring, You seek to drown out that underlying passion for <i>something</i> with bullshit because you don&#x27;t know what it is, because you haven&#x27;t given yourself the time of day to try until one day you&#x27;re nothing but a sum of your plugs, like a swiss cheese without the cheese, just the holes, just a skeleton of who you should have otherwise been.",1420736320

I&#x27;d also question incentive alignment regarding the real estate sites they used to cull the data. If they are using the real estate site&#x27;s self-reported neighborhoods for these listings, I think that everyone can relate to the situation whereby a real estate agent tells you that a certain place is a &quot;steal for the Upper East Side/(generic, more upscale neighborhood),&quot; but when you go out to the apartment it&#x27;s actually a few blocks into Harlem/(not so upscale area).

Your last sentence is perhaps not correct, or else I am not understanding it well enough.<p>Plasmids are indeed a source of resistance, but plasmids just contain genetic code.  They are considered mobile since they are easily transferable between bacteria (including different species).  So for a plasmid to encode resistance to this new antibiotic, it would need to contain the code for a protein which disrupts the action for the antibiotic.  For example, the plasmid would encode for an enzyme that digests the antibiotic at a faster rate than it can work, or bind to the target of the antibiotic with a higher affinity.<p>So maybe what you were getting at is that a plasmid exists out in the world that encodes the protein for resistance, it just didn&#x27;t happen to exist in the researchers niche world, or doesn&#x27;t rely on a random mutation to become a resistance product.",1420735871

So you toss out the 90% of photos you took that nobody else would be interested in. It&#x27;s also specifically about photos that <i>you</i> took, unlike things like Tumblr where people just recycle stock photos. Therefore it&#x27;s actually interesting to follow a friend on Instagram.<p>But there are a few more details that make it work. First, it encourages the use of filters. These filters have been criticized a lot for being &quot;hipster&quot;, but let&#x27;s face it -- adding strong sepia tones or making photos really high contrast tend to make people look better in photos. They block out your flaws. The use of filters on a per-photo basis also works in with what I mentioned earlier, the idea that you don&#x27;t just dump all your photos on Instagram but instead specifically look only for cool ones.<p>Second, it&#x27;s simple. Facebook has become this huge, monolithic, hilariously complex and borderline incomprehensible beast. Who even knows what algorithm goes into constructing your news feed? When I go on Facebook I&#x27;m inundated with a ton of content almost none of which is &quot;cool&quot; -- ads, links to random videos or articles that someone I know &quot;liked&quot; or &quot;shared&quot;, photo dumps, etc. Facebook is like a big family gathering where you cover up that tattoo you recently got with your sleeves, and the talk of the party has died down and now you&#x27;re sitting on the sofa watching ads on the TV for products that you&#x27;re not interested in, waiting for the ads to end so a show will come on that you&#x27;re also not interested in.",1420735331

8857149,comment,8856789,8856789,0,0,Someone1234,,,"Android and PCs are an apples and oranges comparison.<p>On PC code can execute and do arbitrary things (Window 8 &quot;apps&quot; excluded). The only security protections on PCs is either ring 0 or not ring 0. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re Windows, Linux, or OS X the very nature of x86/x86-64 is either &quot;root or not root.&quot; Virtualisation might change that equation one day, but containers still aren&#x27;t commonplace day to day.<p>So on PC application run away is a legitimate threat. You trust Adobe Reader, but if a website tricks Adobe Reader into executing an attacker&#x27;s code then Adobe Reader can do anything it has access to on that PC (which is everything in user-mode, which is a lot). So you use AV as a stop gap to try and catch some of these (although its effectiveness is questionable, things like Click-To-Play on browser plugins, automatic updates, NoScript/Request Policy, and EMET are more reliable).<p>Android also has ring 0/not-ring 0, but unlike PC very little runs in ring 0 anyway, and every user-mode application also has additional security restrictions placed on it. So for example downloading and executing code, while possible, it is far harder to escape even the application&#x27;s own context (since most of it is JavaScript in a WebKit component, not bytecode). So most code exploits don&#x27;t execute &quot;arbitrary&quot; code, they execute very restrictive code.<p>Plus then you have OS enforced app restrictions (manifest permissions). If an app gets hijacked by a bad guy, if the bad guy wants more access than the original author then they need to request it and that is user visible (might set off alarm bells). Even if they just keep the old permissions that may restrict what they can do.<p>Lastly the way Android is designed in general means certain common issues are mitigated, for example:<p>- Cryto-Blackmail (encrypt your stuff then blackmail you into paying or it will be deleted), most apps cannot access other app&#x27;s content, most content is backed up automatically, and if they can access other app&#x27;s content they may not get enough access to overwrite it.<p>- Sending spam or DDoS botnet: Android kills background processes. Android throttles processes using up too many resources.<p>- Stealing passwords: It is very hard for one app to &quot;spy&quot; on another app (rooted phones not withstanding). So if you enter your password on Chrome, you can reasonably be assured that the Space Invaders app didn&#x27;t &quot;see&quot; it (unlike PC, where one user mode process can trivially spy on another).",1420735034

If all of the honest people that complain that politicians are dishonest actually got off their butts and started taking over their local governments, then you wouldn&#x27;t have that problem.<p>In the off chance you see this (since this post has been flag-killed), I&#x27;ll answer this question for you.<p>I worked on the tech team of a well-known political consulting firm for a few years out of college.  While I was not a consultant myself, nor have I run for office, I have seen up close what it takes to get elected.<p>First of all, by far most politicians are egoists to the point of being sociopathic.  This is not a coincidence, this is who our current political system favors.  It&#x27;s not necessarily all the fault of our forefathers, however (who definitely had the right idea, just the wrong implementation). It&#x27;s the particular combination of two-party democracy with mass media that has led to this state of affairs.  To get ahead in this environment, it&#x27;s a huge help if you believe that you are dramatically smarter, better-looking, and more charming than the next guy or gal.<p>Rational people, who are able to quantitatively and honestly say to themselves, I&#x27;m pretty smart, but X and Y are better analytic thinkers, and Z and W have better social intelligence, are at a distinct disadvantage in this kind of system.<p>And then, there are a handful of true idealists who have succeeded in this environment.  Without exception, and regardless of party, <i>all</i> of these people have compromised at least some of their core values, and few of them are able to even accomplish the smallest of tasks to further their ideals, because of all the moral and ethical compromises that they have made to get to where they are.<p>And then there are a very small handful of idealistic people who hang on to most of their ideals, and manage to gain a respectable number of followers.  When they move to make big gains, the system crushes these outliers.  I give you Howard Dean and Ron Paul as examples of this phenomenon on opposite ends of the political spectrum.<p>So no, individual honest people, by their very nature, have very little chance at winning elections in this kind of system.  Collectively, they have no chance.<p>The system is fundamentally broken, and the sooner smart, intelligent people are able to admit this, the sooner we can fix things.<p>Edit: I will add one thing that you&#x27;re absolutely correct about.  Local (county and municipal) government is the last bastion of honest people (and the only elections I still vote in), because it&#x27;s the one place where traditional campaigns are not run.  Particularly in small counties and cities, people are elected on their actual reputations instead of how they run a campaign.<p>But when they try to move up to Congress, they have little chance against a well-funded politician of the type I describe above (and absent self-funding by a wealthy candidate, the dishonest politician will inevitably raise more funds, since it&#x27;s easier to raise funds if you have no moral or ethical boundaries about who you accept funds from, and how you raise them).",1420734424

Even without removing snack foods, changing the amount I put on a plate radically altered my caloric consumption without me really noticing. Now that I&#x27;m at a healthy weight (I should note I&#x27;m very tall so a healthy weight is 190-205ish for me), I brought consumption levels back up to slightly above BMR, and will probably increase more as I start weight training.<p>On a side note, soda and Doritos were regular staples in my diet.

The idea, as I always understood it, was that the massive up-front design of the waterfall method would be replaced with a highly collaborative and iterative process that turns developers into members of a team rather than far away people who receive a spec flung over a wall.  I found the approach very promising when I first read about it.<p>Unfortunately, at this point I have to agree that the term &quot;agile&quot; almost always refers to processes and tools, though they are inspired by the original manifesto. Problem is, those processes and tools are often applied in a way that longer accomplishes the original goal - and in many ways amounts to a &quot;bait and switch&quot; on developers who thought the process would be collaborative (and are the only ones who didn&#x27;t realize one of the tools and processes of an agile project is &quot;CYA&quot;).<p>Daily standups, for example, did seem like a good idea to me at the start, and handled right, they still could be.  If you&#x27;re going to do iterations and respond to change, and place less (or no) emphasis on a massive spec, it&#x27;s a good idea to stay in constant communication.<p>But to me, &quot;agile&quot; turned out to be a mass scale bait and switch.  Daily stand ups lost their value as a quick check in with everyone to see what issues have arisen.  Deadlines still loom, daily stand ups involve project management software shown on a large overhead projector, and developers asked for status reports based on estimates made on fuzzy tasks with limited information (because the developer thought they were being &quot;agile&quot;).  Daily stand ups often morph into a daily application of pressure about why deadlines aren&#x27;t being met.  There&#x27;s a contract (the project plan), just one that wasn&#x27;t properly negotiated.<p>To me, the clearest sign of the corruption of the agile manifesto is how &quot;Customer collaboration over contract negotiation&quot; happens.  Many of us aren&#x27;t specifically dealing with external clients and formal legally binding contracts, but if there is project management software with tasks, assignments, deadlines, and estimates, all with names (perhaps your name) attached, trust me, there is a &quot;contract&quot;.  You are a party to this contract.  Litigation is replaced with status meetings with your manager and perhaps a disgruntled stakeholder who may very well hold a copy of the project plan (ie., contract).  It&#x27;s unpleasant, you don&#x27;t want to be in this spot.  If a contract is inevitable (again, presence of project management software with tasks, names, and deadlines = contract), you&#x27;d better negotiate it.<p>I still think that for many projects, the ideas behind &quot;agile&quot; really would to lead to better software.  But a lot of supposedly &quot;agile&quot; projects are just waterfall projects involving a daily status report.  If that&#x27;s the case, honestly, I&#x27;d rather just do a waterfall project and be open to it.  If someone is going to hold my feet to the fire about exactly what was done and when, I&#x27;m going to want them to specify exactly what needs to be done, and if things are unclear or I need more time to research, I&#x27;m going to want that <i>in the contract</i>.",1420733424

There isn&#x27;t much higher that she could go.  A federal judgeship (to a district or non-appellate court) would actually be a demotion in pay, responsibilities, and prestige.<p>That said, the internet has very little to do with her future.  The Schwartz case, legally and ethically will have little effect on her career.  She has a long and sordid history of not respecting plea deals and of exaggerating drug ties in forfeiture cases.  Consequently, she already faced an uphill battle in ever being seriously considered for a judgeship, and she had essentially no chance of receiving a recommendation from the ABA judicial candidate evaluation committee.  Like most US Attorneys, she will either go into politics or into a very lucrative position with a law firm as a white collar defense attorney.",1420732909

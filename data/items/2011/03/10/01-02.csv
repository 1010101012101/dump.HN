What's your differentiation?<p>The issue you're going to face (because you're a small team) is that you won't be able to reach feature parity with your competitors. I'd suggest to focus on one aspect of your product first, execute it perfectly, and then possibly expand.<p>Also, does your product actually serve a need? Unless it has all the features of MailChimp, Socialblaze, Wordpress, etc... I would rather just use all of these products independently. Otherwise, you'd still end up using them for certain things.",1299722347

It's just the competition was so ugly and cluttered. I've often likened saying Xcode 3 was the prettiest IDE to saying that it was the nicest smelling dog crap. Xcode 4 however, genuinely is pretty. I love looking at it and admiring the amount of work that has gone into it. Apple has had some of the prettiest developer tools in terms of Interface Builder, Instruments, Quartz Composer etc for quite a while, but Xcode was dated. It now feels like the sort of user interface you'd expect from Apple.<p>Looking at the screenshots, I don't see how it's prettier than, say Visual Studio 2010. Maybe it's subjective?\nXcode from the article:<p><a href=""http://fireballed.org/linked/2011/03/09/xcode-pilkington/xcode4review%20findreplacepreview.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fireballed.org/linked/2011/03/09/xcode-pilkington/xco...</a><p>Visual Studio:<p><a href=""http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/vs2010.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/wordpress/wp-content/u...</a>",1299722228

I'm not saying everyone should find them exciting, they are just my personal opinion:<p>* FF4 is the only web browser to combine a tracing JIT with a method JIT for JavaScript. Some websites run amazingly fast with that. See the mozilla demos site for examples.<p>* IE9 has great hardware acceleration on Windows (but JS engine is inferior to FF4 and Chrome), while Chrome has a great JS engine (but hardware acceleration on Windows is inferior to FF4 and IE9), while FF4 is the only browser to have both great hardware acceleration on Windows + a great JS engine.<p>* Firefox is the only major browser that is 100% open source. (Chrome isn't open source, it bundles closed-source Flash and a PDF viewer as well as other stuff. Chromium is open source, but the vast majority of Chrome/Chromium users use Chrome.) Firefox is also developed in the open source way, completely in the open, unlike any other browser (including Chromium, where a lot of development is behind closed doors, then 'dropped' into the open - e.g., CrankShaft).<p>* Almost the same codebase used on desktop and mobile (mobile FF4 will hit RC very soon too). Opera has a mobile version, and Safari and IE have mobile versions too, but they are quite distinct. Firefox brings the mobile and desktop versions closer than those. Among the benefits is you can view desktop versions of websites in FF4 mobile very well. (Of course you generally want mobile versions of websites - but now and then, you do want a desktop version, especially on a tablet.)",1299720001

As a first year surgical resident it's not uncommon to work 110-hour weeks and anything less than 80 feels like a joke.<p>And, as other posters have pointed out, this is despite legislation limiting the number of work hours. The fact of the matter is that if you were to actually work to the letter of the law you'd be sneered at, receive poor evaluations, and patients would suffer because there'd be no one around to do the work.<p>Most programs argue that these hours are necessary to train surgeons since there's not only the usual cognitive side of medicine, but also the technical side of cutting, sewing, etc. That being said, 70% of the hours I put in at the hospital are BS ""scut"" work which could be automated, streamlined, or passed off to assistants. The actual challenging decision points are few and far between.<p>Thus, even the 10,000 hour rule--which a lot of programs use to defend their dismal hours--misses the mark completely since, well, the practice isn't focused.<p>I don't think surgeons are going to be replaced by robots in a significant way for some time, but I would like to see the hands-on part of surgery being performed by techs. A three year, well planned course would be plenty to turn you into a competent operator--as competent as many just-licensed MDs.

But that point is secondary to the fact that even $5 is a barrier for beginners.<p>I think people are objecting because they themselves happened into programming as a passion and career - I know I did. They found some tool, probably for free (QBASIC for me) that got their feet wet initially, and that's how they got their start. A beginner who is neither sure nor convinced that programming is a good thing to pursue is unlikely to spend even a footlong's worth of money on it, and we've lost yet more potential future engineers.<p>Also, the fact that Apple has poured a significant investment into building these tools says nothing - they've been pouring a significant investment into their dev tools for years and offered it for free. Their competitors have also poured enormous sums into dev tools that are available for free.

Our model for the compute-time-plus-markup was the plethora of companies that make money doing a similar model with storage -- Dropbox being the shining example.  But you raise a good point that those are inherently more predictable for the users.  You know that you need <i>N</i> Gb of storage because that's what's on your hard drive, whereas knowing how many seconds a calculation will take is much less knowable.<p>Of course, if we were to take the more-technical route suggested by others on this page (ie. moved from being a ""super-powerful programmable spreadsheet"" to being ""easy cloud supercomputing [with a shiny spreadsheetlike interface]"") then perhaps our current pricing model would make sense.<p>On the other hand, if we stick to the spreadsheet model, you could well be right.<p>Hmm.  Food for thought.

I offer apologies in advance, just in case I don't manage to achieve that goal anyway.<p>First of all, you're oversimplifying my comment, just like you oversimplified the original issue in your post. I never claimed I was unable to understand simple concepts. But the ability to understand a simple concept is quite a long shot from the ability to apply it properly to achieve quality results.<p>Second, you neglected the better part of my comment where I talked about effort, results and time. Yes, I'm pretty sure I could do design; at least, as long as nobody (including myself) minds waiting for me to give it my best shot and produce results that are still not as good as those you could get from a good designer in less time. Maybe it doesn't take talent to design a log-in form, but talent sure helps do it faster and better. In the end, ""faster"" and ""better"" just isn't something you can toss out of the window.<p>Third, if you really think that you can reduce either design or coding to following simple rules, then I'm wondering why you're bothering writing about this at all. Just follow some simple rules to code an application that follows some simple rules to churn out both quality design and code.<p>Every now and then, I see someone write or hear someone talk about how they can do work in more than one discipline and, therefore, there's something wrong with people who specialize. Working in game development has given me tremendous respect for multi-disciplinary projects and the complexities involved. From that vantage, I can tell you that I don't mind when people are proud of their multifaceted nature; it's when they start dismissing specialization that it becomes a problem.",1299718978

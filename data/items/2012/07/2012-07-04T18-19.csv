4200462,comment,4199772,4200260,5,0,kristopolous,,,"Nice Find! I added it to my git-themed twitter account here: <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/gitHater"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/#!/gitHater</a><p>Let me explain what's happening.<p>What you are looking at is actually part-git, part unix-shell-y.<p>You did 
     ls * .txt<p>Let's try something way crazy, type
    echo * .txt<p>What do you see? All of your txt files right?  But that's just echo, not ls.<p>Ahh. Here's the clinch. When you do "" * "", that's called either shell ""expansion"" or ""globbing"" depending on your shell.  Basically, the shell says ""ok, before I run your command, I'm going to look at it and see if I need to do anything on my end""<p>This is why you can do<p><pre><code>   $ n=0
   $ echo $n
</code></pre>
The shell hijacks your input, replacing ""$n"" with ""0"", then feeds it into echo<p>In your example, the shell has hijacked the star in ""ls * .txt"", replaced it with all of your txt files, say (a.txt, b.txt) and then ran ls.<p>That means that ls ACTUALLY got<p><pre><code>   ls a.txt b.txt
</code></pre>
And THAT's why it works with echo.<p>---------<p>So git add ""* .txt"" works differently, what gives?<p>Well, when you put things in double or single quotes you are telling the shell ""hey, don't do your usual stuff here"". The single quotes are more extreme.  If we go back to our n=0 example we can try two more things:<p><pre><code>   $ n=0
   $ echo $n
   $ echo ""$n""
   $ echo '$n'
</code></pre>
As you can see, the ' says ""relax shell, I have this"".<p>So when you do<p><pre><code>    git add ""* .txt"" 
</code></pre>
you are actually passing the ""* .txt"" to git.<p>In most reasonable, sensible programs, the program will look for a file named ""asterisk dot t x t"" in this case.<p>But alas, our friends at git have decided to be tricky. The ' * ' syntax for git is similar to gitignore-like syntax (<a href=""http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/v1.7.10/gitignore.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/v1.7.10/giti...</a>)<p>""Awesome"", you exclaim! Not so fast. It's not the same.<p>So git add '!1' doesn't work. git add 'one/ * * ' doesn't work, only git add ' * ' seems to work.<p>Why is it so hard? Good question! I haven't any idea. But we can commiserate together ... you know, over twitter.<p>Have a good one!",1341428120

4200434,comment,4199772,4200352,1,0,OmegaHN,,,"I suppose you have to know the general idea of a Version Control System (VCS) first before you can understand how Git does version control. I'll try my hand at it.<p>A Version Control System is a software system that uses files to save different versions of your source code (really, it can save any file, but it works best with source code). The system also lets you revert back to an old version of your code, so you can try something radical out on your code knowing that you have a safe version tucked away in your version control system.<p>A 'commit' is when you tell the VCS to take a ""snapshot"" of your files and then save that in its system. Git implements 'commits' with three-location system: the working index (the files on your computer), the staging index (Git's log of what files you want to change), and then the actual commit index (where all the versions are saved). When you stage a file, you tell Git to add the name of that file to it's internal log, telling Git that you want that file to be saved in a version. After you have told Git what files to save (by ""staging"" them), you can commit (with 'git commit') to save that snapshot of your staged files. Later on, you can revert to the snapshot through git commands.<p>Hope this helps!",1341427692

And the awesome news is that there's <i>a lot</i> of room for improvement in current content creation tools. There's just so much we can do to reduce cost and time to produce multimedia content. We have so many technology that are barely being touched by current tools. Because they're stuck in their incumbent sluggish giant position.<p>And that's where startups come into play! We have no ties to old incumbent technologies. We're free to innovate and completely re-imagine how content is created. Look at what wordpress made for publishing websites.

4200367,comment,4198271,4198476,4,0,nbm,,,"I have only a year and a bit of context since starting at Facebook, but here's my viewpoint.<p>Facebook isn't trying to move away from PHP as quickly as possible.  For years, there have been PHP components (primarily web front-end rendering, aggregation/ranking of data from various sources) and C++ components (primarily high-performance back-end services) and other languages like Python (primarily non-production-path/operations back-end services) and Java (primarily Hadoop-related technologies like Hive and HBase, and services that are heavy users of such), and nothing groundbreaking has changed in this.<p>New hires use PHP or C++ or whatever language (and often multiple languages) necessary to work on the team and projects they choose to work on.  New projects use the languages that make the most sense.<p>Almost all web front-end work involves PHP - the frameworks and libraries and runtime environment are well-developed, well-tested, well-documented, and well-known.<p>In terms of HipHop for PHP, the question to ask is: What language could have allowed quick low-barrier-to-entry web-app-centric development in the early days while still delivering the sort of runtime efficiency demanded by the environment?  Languages like Python and Ruby may arguably allow the first (but remember we're talking about early 2004 here, so Ruby on Rails was not out, and neither were Django, Flask, and so forth and WSGI had just come out), but would have required a ""HipHop for PHP""-style solution as well.  Languages like C, C++, and Java may have the runtime efficiency, but it would be a hard argument to say they're as developer-time-efficient as PHP (especially back then).<p>That's a slightly different question to what one should do today if starting a new venture.  And _that_ is also a different question to what Facebook should do today - HipHop for PHP exists, and is delivering performance/runtime efficiency that most languages people mention as an alternative do not.  And, the PHP frameworks and libraries and runtime environment exist and allow rapid development of production code.  It's actually reasonably pleasant to develop for with those in place.<p>The HipHop for PHP team is small, but have huge leverage - this small team of reasonably hardcore low-level C++ programmers are making a whole bunch (hundreds?) of PHP developers way more productive (since they don't have to use a relatively slower-to-develop-in language/runtime like C++), and also makes the cost of operating the site go down by making that code more efficient and reducing the number of servers needed.",1341426609

4200290,comment,4199917,4200190,1,0,dkersten,,,"I don't know if/how Go does this, but what I would do is something like the following: I'd have a thread pool of worker threads which execute the goroutines, so that if a system call blocks the goroutine, the thread will block. The threads would also use work-stealing so that if a thread runs out of tasks (goroutines), they can <i>steal</i> them from another threads task queue. As long as system calls are reasonably rare, this will work with if threads 1-1 with processor cores/hardware threads, but if system calls are common, this this could cause livelock (all threads blocked by system calls, but runnable goroutines cannot run). I imagine that often this would solve itself as system calls unblock the threads when they complete, but to protect against this, I would also have a low priority maintenance thread (or some other mechanism to run this check every so often - perhaps a wrapper around system calls) which checks how many runnable threads are in the thread pool and if there are less than a certain amount (eg number of available hardware threads), then it would spawn additional threads (or, again, perhaps a pool of these backup threads is kept around for cheaper spawning/despawning). Then later as the system calls unblock, the threads can be retired again.<p>Thats just off the top of my head how I'd handle it. I imagine with some more thought you can come up with a better mechanism.",1341425292

You don't always want to commit all of your changes at once. The index is there so you can commit the changes you want instead of just committing all the changes every time.<p>`git commit` means ""turn the contents of the index into a commit"". A commit is a set of changes that logically go together denoting a version of the repository. A commit needs to have a message describing what the commit does. If you just type ""git commit"", it opens up an editor for you to type in your commit message. If you want to skip the editor, you can just pass in the -m flag, followed by your commit message in quotes.<p>Are you familiar with the shell? Are you comfortable with the concept of a linked list? If not, work on those--even if you don't use Git, it's part of being a better programmer.

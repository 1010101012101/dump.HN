46490,comment,46324,46406,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Reddit stored passwords in plaintext not because they were stupid, but because they thought they were being user-friendly.  Spez knew all about hashing passwords, but the price of hashing passwords is that you cant't email a user their old password, you can only give them a link to reset it.  In a comment after the plaintext password scandal broke, spez indicated that he considered this to be enough of an annoyance to be worth avoiding.  Besides, nobody will actually use an important password for a social news site, right? ;-)<p>IMNSHO they made the wrong choice, and I think they'd agree now.  But it wasn't because they were stupid or ignorant.  They made a judgment call, and it turned out their users disagreed.  It's not easy servicing a consumer website with hundreds of thousands of users: no matter what you do, <i>somebody</i> will be pissed off.<p>Besides, at least they weren't like GreatestJournal.com, which not only stored their passwords in cleartext and used an open-source (LiveJournal) codebase, but <i>left their database server exposed to the Internet</i>.  My friend did a simple ""SELECT username, password FROM user"" and ended up with 65K passwords.",1188010460

So even though he may have 4000 users, measuring the value of a twitter follower is very different from measuring the value of a pageview. What exactly does it mean for one person to have more digital presence than another? What exactly is that worth? It seems like it will take a few years for these questions to get fully worked out.",1188010194

46485,comment,46324,46406,0,0,staunch,,,"You're assuming IBM programmers don't make stupid mistakes like storing plain text passwords or leaving gaping XSS holes. That's not a safe assumption at all.<p>I don't think what Reddit did was that bad either. The odds were that they'd fail and no one would have cared that they had plain text passwords. I think startups generally have much better programmers, but their work is so geared towards speed  that security comes second. That probably just means the level of security vs IBM is a draw.<p>BTW. MySpace seems to still store plain text passwords. Try the ""forgot my password"" feature.",1188009981

A new exception was added to the DMCA last year specifically to address things like this:<p>""Computer programs in the form of firmware that enable wireless telephone handsets to connect to a wireless telephone communication network, when circumvention is accomplished for the sole purpose of lawfully connecting to a wireless telephone communication network.""<p>So it looks like this new law specifically allows you to hack your phone if all you want to do is unlock it.  I'm actually kind of hoping that Apple sues the guys who did the unlocking, just to set a precedent when Apple loses.",1188009582

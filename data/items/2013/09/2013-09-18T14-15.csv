One of the things my company does is organise events, sometimes free, sometimes paid for. Hundreds of people sign up. In order to be allowed entry, they will need to get an e-ticket (which is emailed to them a week in advance). My boss considers e-mail verification too much of a hassle. The result? Roughly 10% of the users mistype their own e-mail address (a similar percentage mistype their own name), usually with a single letter missing -- obvious typos.<p>This very problem accounts for the majority of support requests in case of those events (yes, more than 50% of all tickets is because the user entered incorrect information).",1379516263

However some affected ATMs did not count the cash on the way back in. Now the exploit should be obvious - take the majority of the cash carefully and allow the ATM to swallow the rest. The cash you&#x27;ve taken is yours and the money you were supposed to get goes back into your account. No doubt it would be easy to track down customer&#x27;s who had been involved in this exploit, but it&#x27;s a fun story nevertheless.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Gaming-the-System/What-are-the-best-examples-of-people-cheating-the-system?share=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Gaming-the-System/What-are-the-best-exa...</a>",1379515962

In the case of the new trend in generating miles (manufactured spending for credit cards) there&#x27;s an externality that impacts people who don&#x27;t even travel. Credit card companies are required to determine which persons are using the cards solely to generate points for airline miles, to remove them from the programs and potentially cancel their cards. Drug and grovery stores are now required to have their workers fill out federal money laundering forms on these individuals who purchase large amounts of vanilla reloads or conduct suspicious money transfers. The costs of documenting and preventing these abuses are passed on to the end customers, whether or not they even care about airlines miles or even fly. If you use any major credit card company, you&#x27;re subsidizing these operations.<p>If the manufactured spenders put 10% of the effort into productive work that they did into gaming credit card rewards systems, we (and they) would be a lot better off for it.

Because smaller process nodes mean that leakage power for transistors has grown faster than active power there&#x27;s now a lot to be said for running those transistors fast for short bursts rather than at a reduced frequency.  But adding more transistors still increases your power usage linearly, and performance only goes up with something like the square root of the number of transistors you use.  There&#x27;s things that make this not entirely true on the system level, if a better branch predictor or better cache then you might see less bandwidth to main memory and you&#x27;ll be saving power there.  And you can do things with the silicon level process to reduce leakage power at the cost of performance but then make the performance back up with more transistors and still come out ahead.

You&#x27;ve got enough background to get over the initial hump, now start writing &quot;interesting&quot; stuff not just yet another CRUD app.<p>You seem to have a database sized hole... The hard part about databases isn&#x27;t the syntax, or peculiarities of specific DBs, or even optimization tricks to make things faster, but design.  What is normalization?  Why/When would you want it?  What tasks need a relational design, or not...  Even if you never pivot into being a DBA it helps alot to at least minimally speak a DBAs language when you write a CRUD app talking to his DB.<p>Programming as in slinging code syntax stuff, or higher level design?  Might want to crawl inside algorithms for awhile with Knuth and other books.  Much like learning Algebra its not like you&#x27;ll ever use it, its more to discipline the mind to figure out other complicated stuff.  You should really google for and spend a lot of time at &quot;project euler&quot; if you&#x27;re trying to learn higher level programming.  Many of the PE problems aimed at turning you into a better mathematician can be hacked on brute force-ish to make you a better programmer.  As a hint the first problem you&#x27;re not &quot;supposed to&quot; brute force add those together, you&#x27;re &quot;supposed to&quot; figure out the easy formula.  But writing the brute force adder is none the less an interesting experience if you&#x27;ve never done it before in your language of choice.  (edited to add, buy and read and &quot;do&quot; the entire &quot;little schemer&quot; series, or at least the first book)<p>I don&#x27;t know if this would make you more employable, but in terms of extending your greater computer-ish knowledge you could do worse than some embedded stuff.  Get an Arduino and some shields and some servos and some sensors and make it do something really well.  You claimed to know a little bit of C so here&#x27;s something fun to do with it.<p>You also seem to have an OS sized hole in your list of experience so some systems programming type experience might be interesting.  Get a couple free machines (castoffs) and figure out how to use Puppet to make them jump thru hoops.  Since you have a cluster, there&#x27;s a lot of fun you can have learning how clustering/replication tech works and scales.  Don&#x27;t worry about using old junk computers, there&#x27;s absolutely no difference between clustering on new big iron and on a free junkpile P3 other than the new stuff is faster.  Make your own DB host and a bunch of front ends and see what happens.  Maybe try a cluster of DB hosts and FEs talking to the DBs.  Much like the DB thing you may never become a sysadmin but learning to speak their language will help even if you stick to webdev work.",1379514741

Being able to build an entire application or utility from nothing and understanding all the parts is a great skill to have.  I would not recommend learning any particular framework (web or otherwise) except as a tool to gain mastery of a language.  Frameworks are scaffolding to allow you to use your understanding of a language to effectively build your idea into working models, they should not be treated as the be-all-end-all of a language.

[5] But even if you get an email from a partner you should try to delay meeting till you&#x27;re in fundraising mode. </i><p>And from the footnotes:<p><i>[5] Associates at VC firms regularly cold email startups. Naive founders think &quot;Wow, a VC is interested in us!&quot; But an associate is not a VC. They have no decision-making power. And while they may introduce startups they like to partners at their firm, the partners discriminate against deals that come to them this way. I don&#x27;t know of a single VC investment that began with an associate cold-emailing a startup. If you want to approach a specific firm, get an intro to a partner from someone they respect.<p>It&#x27;s ok to talk to an associate if you get an intro to a VC firm or they see you at a Demo Day and they begin by having an associate vet you. That&#x27;s not a promising lead and should therefore get low priority, but it&#x27;s not as completely worthless as a cold email.<p>Because the title &quot;associate&quot; has gotten a bad reputation, a few VC firms have started to give their associates the title &quot;partner,&quot; which can make things very confusing. If you&#x27;re a YC startup you can ask us who&#x27;s who; otherwise you may have to do some research online. There may be a special title for actual partners. If someone speaks for the firm in the press or a blog on the firm&#x27;s site, they&#x27;re probably a real partner. If they&#x27;re on boards of directors they&#x27;re probably a real partner.<p>There are titles between &quot;associate&quot; and &quot;partner,&quot; including &quot;principal&quot; and &quot;venture partner.&quot; The meanings of these titles vary too much to generalize.</i>",1379514215

It makes the most sense to me, personally, to pick Python or Ruby or PHP (Laravel or similar) and learn how to actually program. I think choosing this path will introduce you all sorts of other stuff rest, user input, security, modern front-end tools like LESS, etc.<p>Even sticking with WordPress could yield a good result for you. WordPress and PHP are constantly criticized for a number of different reasons, but the reality remains: WordPress and PHP occupy a huge chunk of a huge market.<p>I&#x27;ve personally identified this to be one of my biggest failings not being able to actually program. At first I thought it was about language, and so I tried PHP (about 100 different times), I tried Ruby a few times, Python, and finally, JS. It turns out that all of these languages require the exact same thing  they require you to think like a programmer.<p>The furthest I got with it was with Ruby. I went through the entire Ruby course at Codecademy, read a lot of the Bastards Book of Ruby (fantastic), and even used Ruby to get through some Project Euler projects. By the end of a few good months of moderate input, I was absolutely still not a programmer, but I felt like I was beginning to think more like one.<p>So that&#x27;s one piece of advice if you want to learn to program, I think you actually need to decide on a language/framework and settle in and learn how to program. Learn how to think like a programmer, which is to say that it isn&#x27;t about syntax and how each language does things slightly differently, but rather, is about process and patters and abstraction.<p>The other piece of advice is to be careful with freelancing. Paying the bills and learning to code don&#x27;t necessarily go hand in hand. Spending 4 nights a week writing a WordPress theme for a client project really won&#x27;t make you a better programmer. If I&#x27;ve learned anything, it&#x27;s this. I&#x27;ve made some great supplemental money doing freelance work and I&#x27;ve learned a ton about WordPress, but I often think about the time I&#x27;ve put into it, and wonder what if I&#x27;d put that same time into learning and working on projects to further my ability to actually program.<p>And finally, the last piece of advice  try stuff out. Try JS, Python, Ruby, WordPress, Drupal, try setting up a VPS at Linode. Try everything you can to get sense of what feels right. I think that will help with your decision as well.<p>Good luck!",1379514056

- Go there and create an account or at least fork over your email address.
- Fill out a bug report, asking you several questions for which you do not immediately know the answer, such as the build number of the software in question and your exact model of graphics card.
- Take screenshots (which on Windows is still a pain in the ass for some inexplicable reason).
- Fill out a CAPTCHA, several times.
- A few weeks later, find that your bug has been closed because you didn&#x27;t use the latest nightly build or some other minor detail.

The second to last freelance project I had was Java backend with AngularJS frontend, and the tricky bits were all in the frontend. Now I&#x27;ve been working freelance for the same company on several projects since June, doing 100% JavaScript; mostly frontend, with bits and pieces of nodejs, grunt and so on for tooling.<p>To get off to a good start I suggest learning how encapsulation and modules are done in JavaScript (e.g. prototype, the module pattern, possibly also node&#x27;s exports or something like requirejs). This will allow you to actually build large JavaScript projects without them turning into a Frankenstein&#x27;s &quot;everything in a single file in jQuery&#x27;s document.ready&quot; monster.<p>Try to focus on learning the language and its features and not get lost in DOM-land (use libraries or your framework of choice for manipulating the DOM unless you have a very good reason not to).<p>Learn all about how to read and manipulate data using XmlHttpRequests, web services, REST, JSON and so on. This will be invaluable for any projects that have third party dependencies, which will be most of them these days.<p>Spend a little time learning about which frameworks are better for rich desktop-style browser apps (hint: probably the bigger ones, like Angular or Ember), and which are more suited to lightweight apps that will also run nicely in mobile or other embedded devices (hint: probably the smaller ones, like Backbone).<p>Polish your jQuery knowledge. It will be popular and useful for a long time yet, and it&#x27;s a big library with lots of extremely handy functions and features.<p>Maybe pick up other useful &quot;utility&quot; libraries like underscore.<p>Finally, if you&#x27;re interested in driving code quality and keeping clients happy and regressions at bay, I suggest you look into automated unit and integration testing. Again here there are large, complicated tools like karma and smaller, lightweight &quot;test logic only&quot; libs like jasmine. If you&#x27;re like me, you will get lots of enjoyment and satisfaction figuring out how to wire up node, grunt, jshint, phantomjs and (your test lib of choice) to get a single command build/deploy/test script. If you&#x27;re likely to work in a team, get that script running in a CI server for bonus points.<p>If you have any questions hit me up on davedx@gmail.com, happy to help! :)",1379513489

6405286,comment,6404563,6404563,30,0,reuven,,,"My favorite story of this sort happened a few years ago: The US has never been successful at getting the public to accept dollar coins.  As a result, the dollar coins -- some with presidents on them, and some with Sacajawea depicted -- were sitting in the US Mint&#x27;s warehouses.  The Mint, in order to get rid of these coins, offered people the chance to (a) order them by mail, (b) have them delivered for free, and (c) pay for them on a credit card.<p>Some people (very cleverly) did the math, and ordered ridiculous numbers of dollar coins on their airline-affiliated credit cards.  When the dollar coins would arrive, the buyers would take them back to their  bank, depositing the money in their account.<p>In other words, these people were getting thousands of dollars&#x27; worth of frequent flyer miles each week, for absolutely free.  The Mint found out about this when banks started sending them enormous numbers of dollar coins, unopened, for storage, and that a very small number of customers were ordering a very large number of dollar coins.<p>The full (and very entertaining) story was done by NPR&#x27;s Planet Money podcast:<p><a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/07/13/137795995/how-frequent-fliers-exploit-a-government-program-to-get-free-trips"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/07/13/137795995/how-freq...</a>",1379513188

I almost never get the question: &#x27;What&#x27;s not going to change in the next 10 years?&#x27; And I submit to you that that second question is actually the more important of the two -- because you can build a business strategy around the things that are stable in time. ... [I]n our retail business, we know that customers want low prices, and I know that&#x27;s going to be true 10 years from now. They want fast delivery; they want vast selection. It&#x27;s impossible to imagine a future 10 years from now where a customer comes up and says, &#x27;Jeff I love Amazon; I just wish the prices were a little higher,&#x27; [or] &#x27;I love Amazon; I just wish you&#x27;d deliver a little more slowly.&#x27; Impossible. And so the effort we put into those things, spinning those things up, we know the energy we put into it today will still be paying off dividends for our customers 10 years from now. When you have something that you know is true, even over the long term, you can afford to put a lot of energy into it.&quot;</i><p>I enjoy the irony of getting his wisdom at a site called Fool.com.",1379512947

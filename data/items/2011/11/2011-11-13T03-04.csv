The first release of Firefox with WebGL had an awful whitelist/blacklist system for video drivers, primarily due to them crashing when asked to do relatively basic initialization and operations.  Now, Firefox has a sensible probing mechanism for video drivers, and as a result, almost any modern video driver will work just fine.  (Certainly anything new enough to run OpenGL 2.0, which means all the graphics chipsets sold today, and those sold in the last few years.)  Intel, ATI, and nVidia chipsets all work just fine; those represent the vast majority of the market at this point.<p>(Also, if a user's graphics drivers don't provide enough stability or security to work with WebGL, Flash won't improve that situation either.)<p>As for browser support, right now it works in released versions of Firefox and Chrome, and preview versions of Opera and desktop Safari.  iOS 5 supports WebGL for iAds, and web content will likely follow soon; people have already figured out how to make it work using private APIs.  As far as I know, current Android releases support WebGL as well.  So, as usual, that just leaves Internet Explorer.  (And even IE users have several possible alternatives, quite apart from upgrading to a better browser: plugins like IEWebGL, Chrome Frame, and even some attempts to use Java or Flash as a fallback.)<p>So, while WebGL support does need a bit more time to become sufficiently widespread, it seems likely to do so in the near future.",1321154617

3229746,comment,3227905,3229564,1,0,FabricPaul,,,"Hi - the parallelism is derived from the dependency graph, which provides task and data based (SIMD) parallelism. So, if you describe a bad graph, then you'll get limited concurrency. The performance you get is directly related to how well you can describe concurrency in your graph.<p>Dependency graphs aren't new - Intel TBB recently introduced a dependency graph model, and it's a well known approach. So if you're looking for a tool for making it easier to run concurrent C++, TBB is a great option.<p>Companies have tried the 'analyze code and work out how to multi-thread it' approach with limited success - it's pretty hard to do that in a dependable manner. Often you see horrible code snippets being inserted as flags etc - which very quickly gets messy and intrusive. It's a lot easier to describe the parallelism at a high level and let the engine handle it from there.<p>Our view is that bringing this kind of performance to dynamic languages is a big opportunity. Our reasoning:
- Modern hardware requires developers to write concurrent applications - the days of one big core are long gone. This is hard.
- Dynamic languages are flexible, easy to work with and fast to iterate. They're also very slow compared to native code, let alone multi-threaded code.
- There are a lot of people that know dynamic languages that can't, won't or don't want to work with compiled languages.<p>That said - Fabric will be free for non-commercial use (students, researchers etc). We open-source everything we build on top of the core engine - all of the extensions, 3D scene graph, rendering etc.<p>As for patenting - we've filed around some of the client-side stuff (I can't disclose details just yet - sorry). Most of the ideas that went into Fabric are not original - it's really how we've combined them to offer something that's (hopefully) compelling. We were very lucky to come at this problem when there was a perfect convergence of technologies - particularly JavaScript, HTML5 and LLVM.<p>Apologies for the ramble - been a long (but gratifying) day :)",1321154361

But at least with alcohol, I'm pretty sure the optimal amount isn't zero in our current society. Not drinking has definitely interfered with my social development, which wasn't great to begin with. I don't plan to start now--among other reasons I can't stand the taste--but the advice I'd give to my 18 year old self is ""go to parties, get drunk, and learn to enjoy it"".",1321153589

3229706,comment,3229360,3229360,2,0,purephase,,,"First off, I say all this as a fan of both Isaacson and Jobs.<p>I am convinced that this book is Jobs' attempt to counter worries that Apple is in trouble without him at the helm. Given that he was a perfectionist, that he would both commission, support and supposedly proof a work that paints him in the light that it does, there must be a motive to the caricature it paints.<p>Think about it. Everyone is worried about the staying power of Apple without him at the helm. He is the quintessential micro-manager, so the concerns are valid. He was also a very private person that, despite some oft-reported claims, held a demi-god like status in the company and with a lot of people around the globe.<p>The book repeatedly (oh god, the repetition) remarks on his intent on ""creating a legacy"", ""making a dent in the universe"", ""working only with the best"" which speaks directly to Apple's future without him.<p>Isaacson even doles out micro-biographies on Cook and Ive. Two entire chapters!<p>It then completely obliterates his demi-god status by painting him as a petulant child, terrible father (early on), liar and narcissist. I cannot imagine anyone reading the book and idolizing Jobs afterwards. It makes him very, very human which is an ideal image to paint if you are/were worried about Apple's future.<p>I am more interested in the biography on Jobs that will be written in 10-20 years from now.",1321153451

Even the good companies fail. What the VCs are worried about is that they're going to say no to Facebook, and then have to explain 5 years from now how the fuck they possibly could have said no to Facebook.<p>What that seems to mean is that if you:<p>* have a persona that at least superficially seems driven, ambitious, likely to succeed, and<p>* you tell a convincing story about a market that might experience explosive growth, and<p>* you have any kind of track record of any sort to make it hard to write you off as a total bozo, and<p>* you have some sales skill, so you can manage the pitch process and create pressure to VC firms, then<p>you're probably fundable even if you think testing means ""practicing instead of really playing"".<p>These kinds of pitches seem very different from the kinds of things people write in Show-HN: postings.

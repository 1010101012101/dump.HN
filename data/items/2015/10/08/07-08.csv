Your larger 3MB texture blocks might end up seperated by smaller allocations for, say, icons.  Or other 3MB textures that can be reused on the next level (to reduce load times).  Long story short, unless you do work to ensure textures are correctly grouped by lifetime (which in many cases will depend on and diverge based on user input) you&#x27;re going to end up with lots of 3MB holes.<p>You switch levels, and release many/most of your 3MB environment textures.  But the icons remain loaded for your UI, so you don&#x27;t free those.  So now you have 3MB holes everywhere.<p>You start to load the next level.  It&#x27;s using a lot more alpha textures in it&#x27;s environment - lots of water and glass.  The alpha channels adds another 33% to the size - these new textures are mostly 4MB.  <i>None</i> of these new textures fit into the 3MB holes.  You&#x27;ve already potentially just wasted about <i>half</i> your available memory (or address space), with a single texture size in two formats of note.  Within a single system (&quot;render&quot;).  Oops.",1444291183

This can be a turn off for people, but for my personal email I discovered that I want folders. This is because my personal email also has the role of backing up my work email. I&#x27;ve lost work email in the past when switching jobs and I don&#x27;t want that to happen again. And with FastMail I can simply download my work email in its own folder, so it doesn&#x27;t have to pollute my personal email. FastMail is also very flexible in its settings. Setting up filters is easy in Gmail but limited compared with what you can do with those Sieve scripts in FastMail. Speaking of the interface, I now like FastMail&#x27;s interface more, as it makes it easier to switch between folders, or back and forth between email, calendar, contacts or notes.<p>SPAM filtering in Gmail is said to be extremely good, however a certain class of spam has been reaching my Gmail Inbox for the past 2 years with me being unable to stop it - I made the mistake of giving away an email address on my blog and now I get emails related to SEO marketing and bullshit. In Gmail I cannot setup a filter that automatically marks an email as spam if it contains the word SEO. But in FastMail I can do just that.<p>FastMail does CalDAV for the calendar and CardDAV for their contacts. I can sync my Android phone and it works out great. IMAP is also very responsive and standards compliant. And personally I feel good about rewarding a smaller player that plays nice with others because monoculture are bad ;-)<p>Another thing I did after that was to create 2 Google accounts. I&#x27;m using one Google account for Google Play purchases and nothing else. This is because Google Play purchases are not transferable. So for example I have an old phone lying around that I gave to my son for playing. Restricted accounts only work on tablets, don&#x27;t know why, so my son ended up having access to my email, which is not cool. Plus I&#x27;m all for paying for apps, but I should be able to share my purchases with my wife. Like if I buy a GPS device, we can both use it, but if I buy a maps app my wife can&#x27;t borrow it without borrowing my account, along with my email. And I don&#x27;t like this kind of lock-in.<p>There are some downsides. I could not find a good email client that can do IMAP Idle. FastMail&#x27;s app works on Android but I don&#x27;t like the UI. On the bright side that app is simply exposing their web interface, so FastMail works very well in a mobile browser, something that Gmail doesn&#x27;t do and it matters when borrowing other people&#x27;s devices.<p>All in all it&#x27;s been a great transition for me and best of all is that I can now try out other Google services and products without feeling remorse or fear of lock-in ;-)",1444290872

Maybe you don&#x27;t consider this exchange anonymous, but when we have conversations, we instinctively associate something which, however slight, is still shaped by what was said, and this becomes part of the collage associated with the source.<p>Identity is mostly shaped by reputation and by impression, both of which are not in our full control, and both of which just happen. So there isn&#x27;t anything to believe. Identity is already part of every message, and the lack of identity is already consequential, unless one deliberately dismisses those consequences. At this point, anonymous exchanges require skill, and this is a new skill that, for example, my parents would not ever be comfortable with.

Slashdot automatically labels anonymous comments as being from &quot;anonymous coward&quot;. But they have a point. If someone is posting anonymously, we can infer they must be hiding something, or that they must be protecting something, or that their true identity is inconvenient. Possibilities are real enough to alter our reception. So anonymous caries consequences of its own. It carries it&#x27;s unique plot lines.<p>Though it can take practice, we can and do make use of anonymous messages. It is merely a new &quot;mode&quot; of communication, and it gives rise to certain types of communities. However, anonymity must be consensual for it to work. Law enforcement will still come after your identity depending on what you say, and that is a case where the consent is broken (or never acknowledged according to them). Messages become drive-by shootings, and this has an effect on the exchange.<p>Also, user names are not the equivalent of anonymity. On HN, karma is a feature of each identity, and baggage can be attached just as easily. And if someone says anything interesting, we can read their other comments to learn more about them. As we read more of what they&#x27;ve said, their user name will begin to have a unique aura. Now if we happen to read a new comment and recognize the name, it will ring a bell automatically, and we will already be working with more information than what was included in the utterance alone.

Meanwhile, a PS3 has exactly 256 megs of memory available to the CPU and we are highly motivated to use every last goddamned byte of it because if we don&#x27;t, our competitors will.  Meanwhile 2, the vast majority of allocations are under 512 bytes.  In practice, even that subset is mostly <64 bytes.  In that situation, fragmentation within a single page becomes serious business.  You can&#x27;t afford to have 10% of a given page be 9-15 bytes gaps between allocations.  That could add up to 15-25 megs out of 256 wasted!  When you get really tight, you can&#x27;t even afford a heap header for each allocation --thus the specialized small block allocators.<p>2) A lot could be done better here.  4 gigs is not a ton of address space to protect different systems from each other.  But, if you assume no system is going to ever need more that 64 megs, then you could divide memory into 64 spaces of 64 megs each and never have to reuse memory between different systems.  I haven&#x27;t heard of anyone doing this.  You&#x27;ll still get corruption from garbage data ending up in pointers.  But, virtual memory segregation would cut out a large class of problems.<p>Static allocation post-boot is not an option in games.  You can be very strict and structured, but the needs of different situations are still too varied.  Sometimes you need 90% UI, sometimes you need 10 gameplay regions, sometimes you need 100% devoted to a single, small room for a boss fight.<p>Similar to fuzzing, I&#x27;ve worked on games that user controller-monkeys.

But the more you use C++, the more nicer it gets as you learn the ropes more and more. It&#x27;s a very complex language, but knowing it pays off in the long run, and the modern C++11 and C++14 are a completely different beast than the previous implementations in terms of ease of usage and code syntax niceness.<p>So, crossplatform is a big thing. If I would write it in C#, it would be tied to either Microsofts C# or the Mono implementation. If I would have chosen Obj-C, it would be pretty much Mac and iOS only.<p>When you need performance + crossplatform, C++ just wins.",1444289333

A 200ft run of that in the house (both ways) isn&#x27;t out of the question if there&#x27;s a central supply in a 2 story building.  That&#x27;s about 1 ohm [1], which doesn&#x27;t sound like much at first until we look at what it ends up meaning.<p>A phone might take an 1 Amp to charge at it&#x27;s fast rate (tablets 2 or more), so we&#x27;ve got 1 Amp, with a 1 Ohm resistance.  That means we&#x27;re going to have a 1 Volt drop to that outlet, which means the phone is likely not going to charge at the correct current since it&#x27;ll only see 4 Volts at the outlet.  It also means you&#x27;ve just had a 20% loss in the power line in order to have a larger central power supply.<p>Combine that with the fact that most Switch-Mode Power Supplies aren&#x27;t actually that efficient when not under load (part of the problem) then it might not be unreasonable to have it running at 80% efficiency to begin with.  At this point you&#x27;re down to 64% total efficiency instead of the 80-90% that the small wall warts end up getting you.<p>You could use a higher voltage, 48V isn&#x27;t uncommon because of the telephone industry, but then you need conversion at the outlet again and end up with the same problem you&#x27;ve got with wall warts.<p>The other option is to use more copper to carry the current, say 10 gauge, which brings the losses to 0.4V and about 10% losses, but you need 150% more copper than 14 gauge.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cirris.com/learning-center/calculators/133-wire-resistance-calculator-table"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cirris.com/learning-center/calculators/133-wire-r...</a>",1444288769

If Perl 5 could break or change its functionality by changing exactly when they deal with reference counting and destroy objects, then it&#x27;s a time bomb in production anyway.<p>That said, your complaint in #2 was about Perl 6 losing to every other language in library support, but I think we&#x27;ve established it&#x27;s nowhere near as bad as that.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s definitely not barren.  There&#x27;s a few tens of thousands of modules Perl 6 can try to use, and there&#x27;s a fairly good way of knowing if they will work or not, since most have good tests.<p>Your original complaint for #3 was also about companies needing to rewrite all their code.  I think Inline::Perl5 goes a long way towards addressing that as well.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but when considering &quot;Their primary motivation for staying on Perl is that they don&#x27;t want to rewrite their code. Perl 6 requires a rewrite of their code.&quot; I think it affects that point of view.<p>I think you have somewhat valid points, I just don&#x27;t think they are nearly as solid as initially presented.",1444287834

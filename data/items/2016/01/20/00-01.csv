I need a technical cofounder to help me get it off the ground.  I’m currently based in Fort Collins, Colorado, but am open to moving wherever we’ll have the best chance of succeeding (NYC, Seattle, Austin, Boulder, etc.).<p>So far, I’ve designed the app, and done some light user testing with different Flinto prototypes.   I’m in the process of putting together a full prototype and getting more users involved in testing.  I’ve also done some work to game the app to make it more engaging.<p>I’m looking for a technical cofounder to choose a stack and do the MVP development work so we can get to the first round of funding.  I’ve been to some startup events and meetups, but I haven’t found anyone that doesn’t have ideas of their own they’re trying to create.<p>I need help.<p>- Is anyone interested in being a technical cofounder?<p>- Does anyone know anyone that is interested in being a technical cofounder?<p>- Do you all have any advice on where to find a technical cofounder?<p>A little about me:<p>I’m a Cal Poly grad with a degree in Economics, Finance, and Statistics..  I worked at Apple for about 7 years in both Finance and Project Management.  Most recently I worked for a fast growing YC startup and was able to hone my user experience skills, gain a working knowledge of startups, and learned a ton about design.  More personally, I’m an avid skier, hiker, backpacker, and definitely geek out on Star Trek and Star Wars to a semi-obscene degree.",1453251573

You got me there. I overlooked the obvious counter to my own statement for whatever reason. I retract it.<p>&quot;Related Reading from Meredith Patterson, &quot;The Null Hypothesis Loves You and Wants You to Be Happy&quot;:&quot;<p>I appreciate the article but I&#x27;m not sure it applies. The approach is certainly useful when you can do that. There&#x27;s too many things, especially in social decision-making, that involve multiple factors working together in non-linear or inseparable ways. So, it&#x27;s more like trying to identify the various factors, look at how they often play out, assess how they apply to a certain situation, and make an educated guess about what&#x27;s likely to apply. Probabilistic and case-based reasoning dominates most things of any significant complexity and uncertainty.<p>We get a ton of mileage out of null hypothesis and associated analysis, though. Way more than I&#x27;d expect on occasion. The tricks people used to eliminate all variables but race or gender are a good example. Otherwise, we&#x27;d be looking at social situations weighing the odds as I described above. So, null hypothesis has limits but still worth attempting to use since we can&#x27;t be sure of its <i>real</i> limits yet.<p>That&#x27;s what&#x27;s fun about it to me, though. So reliable, relatively simple, and yet so much more potential to find cool new ways to use it. :)",1453250767

For a scientist who has a crazy idea that doesn&#x27;t want to be micromanaged, that can be an ideal environment. Those crazy ideas are the most likely to be published in Science or Nature if they work, in which case, having a famous PI like Langer or Church helps a surprising amount.<p>So, yes, being in a huge lab is a bit of a pyramid scheme, and probably gives undue credit to the PIs.

It&#x27;s a fact of rendering, not just of GPUs, that output colors are premultiplied. The over operator multiplies colors by the source alpha values while you blend - that is where &quot;premultiplication&quot; happens when you render or composite something. Some software renderers have an &quot;un-premultiply&quot; flag to do a divide right at the end, so you can spit out files with unassociated colors in them, but otherwise anything rendered comes out premultiplied.<p>I believe this is exactly why WebGL defaults your canvas to premultiplied compositing over the rest of the page. Your output is premultiplied even when your input isn&#x27;t. It is also a good reason to think in pre-multiplied colors and use the blending functions that assume pre-multiplied colors, and pay attention to, and convert/premultiply on the fly, when you need to accept unassociated color sources like hand-painted textures.",1453249061

I suspect that you find it easy, because you&#x27;ve spent the time developing an understanding of the system.<p>> Not only do you not know there is another layer somewhere doing stuff that impacts you you can&#x27;t even reliably follow a path to find that layer and debug it.<p>And this is where our roles are reversed! I would have little trouble following that path, all the way down into C if needed- because I&#x27;ve spent plenty of time understanding the system.<p>The problems you describe are problems anyone would have with an unfamiliar system, and it&#x27;s not Ruby&#x27;s fault.",1453248177

I think the real problem is that Mathematica&#x27;s performance can feel inconsistent to beginners (i.e. some things are fast, some are slow, and why they are fast and slow is not at all obvious.)",1453248125

Use case is over 10,000 servers with over 2 million metrics incoming every XX seconds. Riemann simply performs better, probably because it uses streams instead of a poller. The other part of our use case is to use it primarily for alerting, and it&#x27;s fantastically responsive and robust for that, including simple integration with other systems (email, Slack, nagios, PagerDuty, etc). Bosun seems like a good tool for other uses however.",1453248060

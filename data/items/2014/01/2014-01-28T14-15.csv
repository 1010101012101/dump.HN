7137376,comment,7137337,7137337,2,0,codegeek,,,"Where do you live ? Taxes are location specific so please specify that before you can get any meaningful advice.<p>EDIT: As you confirmed that you are in Floride/US, here is my advice being a self-employed myself:<p>1. Find a good competent CPA/tax advisor who is <i>local</i> and understands floride specific rules. Ask to have an initial consultation. This is very important because it will save you a lot of hassle in the long term.<p>Now, you are probably looking for more than &quot;find a damn CPA&quot; but that point is still critical. I will now give you some pointers on what are some of things to research about this.<p>1. How/what will you do business as ? Will you just be yourself aka freelancer/1099/sole prop/dba OR will you actually do business as a corporation/LLC ? It is hard to give specifics on the internet but start learning the diff b/w 1099/LLC/DBA/Corp/S-Corp. Depending on your need, you may need one or the other. In general, the idea of doing business as is not just about tax consequences but also about liabilities. For example, as yourself/1099, you are exposed to the highest level personally while as corporation, you personally are exposed the least (again a general rule but depends on cases). In terms of taxes, again usually by yourself/1099 will make you pay the highest tax but has least adminitrative burden of other expenses like payroll, accounting etc. So it is all about the balance between one or the other end.<p>- Will you need general liability insurance ? This is most likely needed for most big contracts. Look into this. I buy mine from <a href=""http://www.techinsurance.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techinsurance.com</a> (no affiliation. they are just a broker who gets u a good deal)<p>- Other than general liability insurance, you also might need &quot;Errors and Omissions&quot; insurance a.k.a E&O. This is not required unless you are working on mission critical projects where you are liable for coding errors etc. techinsurance.com also has that.<p>- You will need to run payroll. The idea is that your company will pay you a salary (W-2) and any other benefits. If you are corporation, you have more flexibility in how much to pay as a salary vs other benefits but on 1099 etc, you don&#x27;t have that flexibility.<p>- Let me try and give you a general idea of taxes that you might have consider:<p><pre><code>  - Personal Income tax: This is the usual federal+state+local taxes that you pay as employee on paycheck.\n\n  - Payroll Tax: You will have to pay Social Security tax, medicare tax as both employee and employer. It comes down to about 7.65% for each (SSN 6.2,Medicare 1.45) employee and employer portion making it total of 15.3%. Btw, SSN tax is limited to upto 117,000 (2014 limit) so if you make more than that, you don&#x27;t pay SSN on the extra. You pay medicare on entire earnings. BUT, again the question comes down to 15.3% of what ? on 1099, you have no choice but to pay 15.3% of *entire* income. with S-corp etc, you can control how much you pay on W-2 and these payroll taxes are then calcualted on that number. But beware, if you pay yourself too low a salary to save on payroll taxes, IRS comes after you. So a reasonable salary should be paid. What is &quot;reasonable&quot;? Not defined very hard but usually market rate for your skillset. \n\n  - Other taxes related to your business. This can be anywhere from corporation taxes, umemployment insurance, disability insurance etc. All this goes out to IRS.\n</code></pre>\n- Retirement plans: as self employed person, you can setup retirement plans with companies like fidelity etc. One benefit is that you can put more than the usual employee limit (17,500 for 2013) because you can also contribute a employer portion (upto 25% of earnings) but the total is capped at 50,500 (2014)<p>So there is a lot to this. Like I said, best bet is to talk to a CPA and go from there.",1390921056

7137359,story,,,13,19,MattBearman,"Ask HN: Should I continue with my bootstrapped startup?",,"I launched BugMuncher (http://bugmuncher.com) a couple of years ago when Google + launched. Some people on HN seemed more interested in G+&#x27;s feedback tool than G+ itself, they wanted this tool for their own website. BugMuncher was based on G+&#x27;s feedback tool.<p>I&#x27;ve put a lot of time into BugMuncher, going from MVP to full app, but I&#x27;m only making $200 / month. I fear people are impressed when they first see BugMuncher, but no one <i>needs</i> this tool. I dogfood BugMuncher with my own users, even they don&#x27;t use it much.<p>I think it could have more use for reporting cross browser issues, but all screenshots are created with webkit, so it&#x27;s pretty useless for that. I&#x27;ve looked into using VM&#x27;s to create screenshots for different browsers, the only service that would work is crossbrowsertesting.com, but they&#x27;re prohibitively expensive. I&#x27;d either have to put my prices up a lot, or cut the monthly report limit by 70%<p>Which brings me to my only competitor, Usersnap - https://usersnap.com. They launched after me, but got VC funding, and use VM&#x27;s to take screenshots in the same browser/OS as the user. Based on their pricing and report limit, I think they use crossbrowsertesting.com for screenshots, and the last time they posted a show HN, people complained 50 reports is not enough for $19 / month.<p>I&#x27;m now wondering if BugMuncher will ever be my full time job, I&#x27;ve got other things I&#x27;d like to work on, and I&#x27;m doing well freelancing. I don&#x27;t feel like I have time for BugMuncher unless it can bring the majority of my income.<p>- Would you use BugMuncher as it is now (webkit screenshots)?\n - If not, would you use it if I used VMs to take screenshots with the correct browser, if so, would you want higher prices or lower limits?\n - Should I consider funding?\n - Should I stop, and sell BugMuncher or open source it?",1390920905

7137316,comment,7135206,7135206,4,0,rayiner,,,"This sort of thing has been happening in the U.S. probably ever since there has been a U.S. At common law, the waters of the state were held in trust by the state for the public, and the beach between the water and high tide line were part of this trust. People were held to have a right to access and use this public property for purposes like fishing, bathing, cleaning clothes, etc. This concept dates back to Roman times. There is an amusing case in 1892, where the Supreme Court reversed a sale by the City of Chicago of the submerged land along the shore of Lake Michigan to a railroad company, holding that the transfer was invalid because the public trust land could not be alienated: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_Central_Railroad_v._Illinois"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_Central_Railroad_v._Il...</a>.<p>Because this concept is well-entrenched, rich people, have resorted to buying up the land adjacent to the public beaches and cutting off access that way. Some states have responded by requiring private property owners adjacent to beaches to provide reasonable access to the public through their property. This particular conflict isn&#x27;t any different than conflicts that are happening all over the country over beach access. Incidentally, it&#x27;s quite amusing to me to watch Silicon Valley techies&#x27; sense of &quot;but no, really, we&#x27;re different!&quot; idealism slowly come crashing down as they realize that there is nothing new under the sun. &quot;Rich guy tries to block beach access&quot; wouldn&#x27;t even elicit a reaction from a Floridian.",1390920555

Why wouldn&#x27;t you pay private firms instead to do the same job more effectively? And then, of course, it&#x27;s easy to imagine that such a regulator would only provide information to paying customers using a smartphone app, for example.<p><i>> How do we know the regulators aren&#x27;t influenced by whichever of the protection firms they buy from? </i><p>How do you know your government regulator is not in bed with the company it regulates?

If I suspect one regulator takes bribes, I switch to another. Or maybe I subscribe to both and compare their info.

One thing I can tell you is that the poor will be able to afford protection agencies, just like they can afford owning a car or a pair of jeans or a computer. A protection agency doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive to be profitable and it doesn&#x27;t mean having personal body guards. There are various segments on that market and each can be covered. The crucial difference is that the poor will now be customers of the protection agency, whereas in the current system, I guess you&#x27;re not going to argue, it is the poor who most often become victims of police brutality and injustice - the reason is, they&#x27;re not customers, the police and the judges will be paid indefinitely and they know it.",1390920373

But, what I&#x27;m saying is that&#x27;s where you&#x27;re effectively changing the subject. That is, it still doesn&#x27;t speak to the current treatment of employees at corporations that employ millions of workers right now, and will likely continue to do so for the foreseeable future. So, why let them off the hook? It just comes off as a disingenuous red herring to suggest that the remedy is for folks to go out and start new businesses. We know that it&#x27;s extremely difficult for any individual business to succeed for a variety of reasons. Yet, what you&#x27;re saying is that to remedy this problem, many, many new businesses must do so in significant numbers. I&#x27;m an idealist, but that&#x27;s just not realistic--particularly in the near future.<p>And, I read at least a tinge of disdain for workers implied in your comments, especially given the current environment that has seen more than its share of Ayn Rand talk and hostility aimed at workers. The sentiment comes off as one of &quot;be happy with what you get, and if you don&#x27;t like the way you&#x27;re treated, then start your own business&quot;.<p>><i>it&#x27;s not just starting but growing businesses that should be less impeded by regulation</i><p>Yeah, I was simply responding to what you&#x27;d written re: starting a business, but agreed that regulations pose <i>some</i> hurdle at all phases. I run a business. You&#x27;re not going to hear me cheer-leading in favor of the current regulatory environment. I don&#x27;t like it either, but it&#x27;s not my biggest problem by miles. I&#x27;m sure it varies by industry type, and I agree with those that you listed. But, the decrying of regulations has generally been overblown, political buzz-wording in an effort to promote a particular agenda.<p>So, here we have to distinguish between small businesses and major corporations. When you hear the political-speak decrying regulations it&#x27;s generally a tactic to use small-businesess as cover for large corporations. &quot;There&#x27;s too much regulation and it&#x27;s killing our small businesses&quot;, which is cover for &quot;abolish environmental protections, consumer protections, financial market protections, etc. so corporations can realize even more profit&quot;.<p>So, the term &quot;over-regulated&quot; comes fully-loaded. And, that&#x27;s what makes me wretch.<p>Where we do intersect is in acknowledgment of the tilted playing field and pay-to-play political environment/markets. Whether it&#x27;s through manipulation of the regulatory environment, ridiculous subsidies, or any multitude of tools, this obviously hurts the market, workers, and everyone--except of course, those who have the deepest pockets.",1390920276

If you want to attract good candidates who know their stuff, they will most likely be put off by not having any idea. You can always argue &quot;but what if my lowest number is too high and I lose by disclosing it first?&quot; but the fact is that if a good fit candidate is reading that job description, your lower range is most likely indeed a &quot;low&quot; number. Good candidates are more interested in the high number because if that number is anything below their requirement, why bother ? But then you could argue &quot;what if I can convince them to join me even though I am paying peanuts&quot; and the answer is you will most likely lose. Rarely you will find good fits who are desperate. Remember they are usually &quot;passive&quot;. So instead of worrying about numbers game, be honest and disclose whats the &quot;least&quot; you can pay and whats the &quot;most&quot; you can pay. Leave the in between for negotiation. Good candidates who you want to hire will like the fact that they know what they are working with. Also, don&#x27;t make the range too broad like 60K-150K.

7137210,comment,7124139,7134924,1,0,snitko,,,"I think all your assumptions come from the fact that you don&#x27;t believe competition, specifically on the protection market, can work. If I could convince you that in fact it would, then it appears all other questions can be resolved. For example your hypothetical scenario in the last paragraph is absolutely impossible if people have a choice of whom to pay for what services. In fact, it is possible even if this firm is monopolistic: stolen property? how was it stolen? why did nobody care? why did customers thought it&#x27;s okay to keep paying to that firm knowing that their property can be alienated at any point in the same way?<p>But anyhow, back to competition. First of all, for a competition to exist, it doesn&#x27;t have to take 50% of the market. It only has to be sure that it is cheaper for the monopolist to compete with it fairly than to go to war using tactics such as predatory pricing or actual violence. In almost all cases fair competition is more profitable in the long term. It is established by many industry experts and economists that predatory pricing doesn&#x27;t actually work. Only legislators seem to not grasp it and there&#x27;s a good reason why: because their pay depends on the fact that they are supposedly protecting the public. I&#x27;ve read an awesome book about Airlines once (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W6871G/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W6871G/</a>) and at the time it was a big surprise for me to find that governments very often launched predatory pricing and anti-competitive cases against discounters, who tried to disrupt the market of big established carriers.<p><i>> In a system with a democratic government, the official has to at least pay lip service to working for the public good and it&#x27;s illegal to accept that payment. </i><p>The difference is, in a democratic government official when elected knows almost definitely he&#x27;s not going to lose his job for the next n years. He knows people will keep paying taxes. How does that create any incentive for him to work in the interests of the public? This kind of situation only creates incentives to accept bribes and use the position of power. If this official does this carefully, he will never face allegations, let alone jail time, because, of course, the judges and the police work in the same system with him and it is HIM who pays them, although not from his own money. The only people who go to jail are in the lower echelons of power and those are the ones who weren&#x27;t careful enough to not piss off their masters. The Democratic system the west adores so much is just civilized and institutionalized corruption. It&#x27;s a theatre pulled over the eyes of the people and it&#x27;s so sad many people have this blind faith or at best acceptance of it.",1390919603

I&#x27;m not sure why either was brought up though. If OP is comfortable with these tools and wanted to write about his own experience, I could understand, but for the sake of a tutorial, what benefit does adding these complications, which present a risk of alienating some segment of the tutorial&#x27;s audience, provide? Unless you need a back end language, you don&#x27;t need to install a local Apache server; you can run html files directly from whatever folder they&#x27;re stored in, and if you link with relative paths, you can transfer the whole directory to a live server and it will still work fine, and for the amount of rules a beginner will probably write for a small, personal website, using LESS is probably overkill. Furthermore, anyone who&#x27;s comfortable with either of these practices would have no problem adapting them to a basic &quot;building a website with a grid framework&quot; tutorial, and everyone else can pick them up later, when their value becomes more apparent.<p>It reminds me a little of the way every Javascript tutorial I find lately seems to assume that you&#x27;re running a Node.js server.

I wanted to switch back to C or C++. Mainly to save on ton of memory being used which I think is unwarranted.<p>So I experimented with a new service, and coded it in all three C, C++ and Java. When I did this I had not coded in C++ for 10 years, but it did not hurt at all. I could switch back easily with almost no great difficulty. There were some minor inconveniences of foregoing the Eclipse editor. I think, I might have missed Autocomplete the most.<p>But within hours after I started, I was getting my previous feeling of the Vi(m) editor coding of C++ back. And with the benefit of having STL (vectors, strings, etc.) I did not feel much discomfort.<p>But coding the same service in C was painful. And it was mainly because of not being able to basic things on strings easily like copy and concatenate.<p>But thankfully I still managed to do it. And on comparing the three services for latencies and memory usage, I found little difference between C and C++.<p>So eventually that service was deployed in C++ and still runs the same way.<p>This above episode happened about an year back, and recently I am using Go to do a lot of services (new as well as moving some old). Mainly I have been motivated by the promise of an easier C, which it seems to offer.<p>Some services, coded in Go, I have deployed and are already running very well.

You can talk all about your great company, awesome team, great perks but if you don&#x27;t tell me where do I need to go, it is really not very useful.<p>- COMPANY NAME: I hate it when recruiters post &quot;Fortune 500 client&quot;. Really ? Could you be any more specific ? </sarcasm><p>- SALARY RANGE: &quot;Market Rate Salary&quot;, &quot;Salary: Competitve&quot;, &quot;Salary: commensurate on experience&quot; is all bullshit. Give me a range. I understand that the exact salary could depend on how good you are but every employer has a range. Specifically big companies. Also, please make the range reasonable. 60K-150K is bullshit because then you are just throwing numbers for the sake of it. 60K-85K or 100K-130K is more reasonable.<p>- TEAM DESCRIPTION: Describe the team as much as possible without necessarily revealing personal info. I would rather like to read &quot;We are a team of 5 people spread across the globe where 2 of us do the back end dev in NYC.......&quot;. Don&#x27;t give me generics like &quot;Excellent motivated team working on world changing projects looking for the next ninja to join our awesome team&quot;. Really again ?<p>- WHY ARE YOU LOOKING TO HIRE: This is a must for me. Is this position open just because you have some cash to burn to show good to the management that you are &quot;growing&quot; the team or is there really a pain point that can be addressed by hiring. What problems are you facing currently that could be solved by this hire ? It is better to be needed than being a nice to have.<p>- BENEFITS: This one is a nice to have. But again be specific if you can. You offer 401K/pension ? awesome. now tell me what the employer match percentage is. Or at least link to your HR benefits site if it is externally available. I am always surprised to see how little you know about benefits until you are hired. In the US, health insurance is a big deal. I want to know upfront what kinds of plans are offered which could impact my salary requirements as well.",1390918632

But no comparable existence theorem can be found in the various models with imperfect competition. For example, if you remove the condition &quot;no economies of scale,&quot; you exclude convex feasible production sets, and you don&#x27;t get guaranteed existence. Models of imperfect competition need to add other less plausible assumptions to get back existence of equilibrium. (This won&#x27;t bother Austrian economists or post-Keynesians, because they reject General Equilibrium Theory as misleading and useless anyway. However, these schools of economics don&#x27;t frame their ideas in mathematics such that it is possible to prove theorems about the existence, uniqueness, and stability of equilibrium.)",1390918403

If you want to fly a titan, you can do it within two years (or less) if you are smart about it.<p>However what makes EVE every unique is that a new player is valuable as a 10 year old veteran if they are willing to learn. A small ship can hold a carrier or super carrier in place till reinforcements arrive. It takes you 2 weeks to train into that. Hauling for your corporation in a 1 months old character can be as valuable as having a 100million skillpoint character.

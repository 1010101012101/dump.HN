Cut and dry, cannot get any simpler. If you distribute binaries compiled from GPL source, you are required to distribute source. Apple is not distributing source, case closed.<p>Furthermore, the App store license forbids end-users from redistributing binaries, which again, is a cut and dry violation of the GPL, since it not only says the opposite, but that you must allow them to distribute binaries <i>and</i> source. This isn't an ""if you touch GPL in any way"" problem. It's a ""if you give someone something under the GPL, you must follow the GPL.""<p>Apple is not a dumb pipe.

1380258,comment,1380199,1380199,0,0,pedoh,,,"I went to an audiologist and paid $100 to have molds of my ears taken. A week later, I had a set of ear plugs with filters in them to block out most frequencies. I bought them for flying, and now that I have them, I would rather miss my flight than fly without them. If you're just looking for the noise silencing aspect of headphones, I'd highly recommend a custom plug.<p>For music, I have a pair of Shure E2Cs. They not only block out sound really well, but in my opinion produce very good sound. One big advantage of in-ear design like this is that you can significantly lower the volume of your sound source, which will keep your ears happy and healthy. But not everyone feels comfortable with the in-ear style. When I bought the Shures they were @100; today the Shure SE210s are available for $100, but I don't know their product line very well, so I don't know the difference, say, between the SE210s and the cheaper SE110s.<p>Also note that with most of the in-ear headphones, you can take them to an audiologist and get custom plugs made, as well. It's probably not worth it to buy a $100 set of headphones and then pay an extra $100 to get custom molds, but if I were purchasing a higher end set of Shures (or a similar product from Westone or Etymotic), I'd get the molds.",1274882110

They don't noise cancel, they noise isloate. I wear them in NYC, and whether it's a loud subway, a bus, or a jackhammer, I can keep the volume way low, and still hear the music. It's also great for your long term hearing health since you will keep the volume way low. Before I got them my iPod was at 75% volume. With them, anything over 25% is too loud. Perfect for mowing the lawn, though.<p>There is one con with these and that is they are fragile. The buds themselves will never have a problem, it's the cord and TRS conenctor. They will break at some point, but Etymotic is very good about giving you an RMA repair/replacement even after warranty is expired.

I've wanted a nice set of headphones to use when coding/mowing/etc, but have yet to purchase any because I do not know which to buy.<p>A couple of guidelines: I like noise canceling, but that usually pumps up the price and I hate when headphones require an extra battery. I usually prefer over-the-ear headphones to earbuds, but I won't rule earbuds out.<p>Kind of an oddball question, I know, but the fact is that I respect you all's opinions quite highly especially when it comes to which tech to buy.<p>I appreciate any assistance you might provide!",1274880368

Companies like Apple and Nike should not be allowed to outsource human misery, pollution, or anything else that is reprehensible.<p>Apple have been bragging about how green their products are, so clearly they are not above taking credit for things done by their subcontractors in their name. So it's fair to bring their name into it when asking questions about working conditions.<p>That being said, it's also fair to ask HP, Dell, or anyone else who employs Foxconn the exact same questions.",1274880321

You still end up with a call stack, but you don't use it the same way.<p>I'm currently implementing an approximate search engine this way in a high level language.  I've done some proof-of-concepts with this technique and it seems very efficient, because I can just kill the machines without having to run them to completion when I think I've found my answer (or am sure there's no answer to find).",1274880104

The reason developers didn't take to the HTML5 solution was that it was too slow for anything non-trivial.. I don't personally even care for it when making trivial applications, due to the half second delay before interactions make it to your javascript events in WebKit on my 3g phone. The linked game (which isn't particularly complicated) is completely unplayable on it.<p>But sure, on the current (3g s) and future gens, it does seem like a reasonable alternative.",1274879581

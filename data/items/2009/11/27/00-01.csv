In fact, he would tell me to not waste time making the code ""pretty,"" just get things done quickly.  I simply ignored him, and wrote clean, well designed code anyway. :)<p>I always write in the most productive language I can, given the choice.  But it is still possible to design and structure your code well in even the worst languages.<p>I understand the concerns IT has about ""cowboy coders.""  But we're talking about people who didn't even understand the relative precedence of addition and multiplication, in this case.  So this was more than just wanting to by pass bureaucracy, I'm honestly not sure whether they were capable of implementing the mathematical models my boss wanted.

963291,comment,963154,963216,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> 2 - the disparity in prices shows that the free market just doesn't work for American Health Care (basic microeconomics) she just starts talking over me. Jingoism has replaced discourse.<p>Some reasons American medicine is very expensive:<p>1. Health insurance, but not treatment, is fully tax deductible. So if you buy your own penicillin, it's with after tax money, but if your insurance company buys it, it's pre-tax money. That's one of the reasons that health insurance is so widespred in America even for routine medicine like antibiotics and checkups. That's a major contributing factor in why the administrative costs are so high.<p>2. There's a shortage of doctors in America, and qualified doctors from other countries are not allowed to practice medicine in the United States. So there's good doctors from Canada, England, Japan, wherever that'd love to practice in the USA, but can't. This artificially inflates doctor's wages by restricting supply.<p>3. American doctors are typically required to get an undergraduate degree, medical degree, and do a below market, crazy hours residency in order to be able to practice medicine. That's 8-10 years of study and below market working to practice medicine. Now, medicine is very important and needs to be done right, but I don't believe for a second that a focused apprenceship couldn't teach a very specific kind of medicine - say arithscopic surgery - in just 2-4 years under a highly trained doctor, but this isn't an option.<p>4. The Food and Drug Administration requires new drugs to be proven not only for safety, but also efficacy. That's an incredibly high and expensive burden to meet - that means that drugs need to be proven to work to a certain standard, instead of just not harm. This adds years of development time and millions of dollars in cost to the new drug development cycle.<p>Those are all legislated reasons that increase the cost of medical insurance, doctors, and drugs. They'd be fairly easy to remove -<p>1. All medical and health expenses can be written off taxes regardless of insurance. Employees can choose to convert som of their wages to a medical or health plan tax free to both the employer and employee. (Currently, under most circumstances, only employer-provided health insurance can is tax free)<p>2. Allow any doctor in a country with reasonably competent medical standards to practice in the United States.<p>3. Require that doctors be able to demonstrate that they can practice their area of medicine capably. Be flexible in how they demonstrate that. Note: This will incur high opposition from medical schools and current doctors who are currently enjoying the wage premium and had to go through the very long, difficult, and expensive system.<p>4. Change the drug standard from ""safety and efficacy"" to only safety. Drugs will come to market much faster and cheaper. There's plenty of people and organizations that will test proven safe drugs for efficacy for free or nominal cost once drugs hit market, and efficacy will get understood with time. Put this way - a proven safe but questionably effective treatment against heart disease being held off the market for five years and costing much more to get to market is not a good thing. If it's certainly safe, then let people make the decisions with their physicians, instead of having the FDA take such a strong gatekeeping stance.<p>Technology has progressed such that we don't need government protection from ourselves as much any more. The current set of legislation has greatly increased the costs of doctors and medicine. Regardless of political position, and regardless of stance on other health issues, addressing these four points will make the medical system fairer, more effective, and and less expensive with relative ease.<p>Admittedly, there's some powerful entrenched interests that are winning in the current arrangement, and will oppose these simple improvements.",1259283201

How ""free market"" something is is a continuum, not a binary distinction, but my ability to price discriminate or choose among competing insurance providers is effectively nil. I sometimes wonder how much of the problem could be fixed if we took the simple step of stopping making it virtually necessary to get health insurance from your employer for tax reasons and then just see what happens for a couple of years.<p>(But naw, too simple, let's pass a 2000 page law.)",1259283004
963289,comment,963154,963273,0,0,dstorrs,,,"First off, you've got a great point here, and I agree with just about all of it.  But I do take exception to one point:<p>> (in some respects [markets resemble] biological evolution, only less stupid and short-sighted)<p>LESS short-sighted?  When all of our markets are optimizing for 6- or even 3-month returns?  When companies are structured in long-term suboptimal ways because you need to maximize profits for the short term to keep investors happy, or the people at the top get fired. cf the infamous quote from Citibank's former CEO, Chuck Prince:  ""While the music's playing, you've gotta dance.""

963288,comment,963154,963216,0,0,cwan,,,"I'm confused.  First off, let's accept that what Bray is talking about is healthcare.  The problem is that there is a plurality of voters who seem to be saying they oppose the current legislation making their way through both Houses.<p>On the other hand, not only do a majority of Americans want healthcare reform (<a href=""http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/healthcare/november_2009/when_pundits_compare_apples_to_oranges_one_look_at_health_care_polling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/curr...</a>) but most say they are happy with their own plans.  Thus it's inaccurate to say that ""a voting majority of Americans apparently want their government to provide them"" [with healthcare] if in fact he's referring to healthcare.<p>What confuses and scares me about the current legislation is that it assumes that everything that both the private and public sector in the US has done is wrong with the aim towards radical change for everyone.  This ignores the multitide of things the US had done right - from healthcare innovation and research to even process innovation (e.g. Ambulatory surgical centers - an example can be seen in India though there are many in the US as well <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125875892887958111.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125875892887958111.html</a>).<p>There are those who argue that the healthcare system in the US is an example of failed markets ignoring the government incentives that favors employer provided healthcare, that the US spends more per capita on public healthcare than the Canadian government does, and the rather high costs of malpractice insurance.  But let's say we even accept that it is a market failure and market failure alone, isn't there an assumption here that the US government wouldn't do even worse?  (Again in the context that the government already controls Medicare)<p>One of the basic policy arguments for public and universal healthcare is that it could encourage entrepreneurship.  If that's the goal, why then does the Senate bill dismantle Health Savings Plans that effectively allow for coverage portability?  Why force the additional taxes on businesses that employ more than a small handful of people - effectively discouraging hiring?  Why is the CBO estimating that both plans would place an even greater healthcare burden on the economy than currently exists?<p>If legislators are serious about reforms, why would they first not attempt to propose changes that optimize existing spending and changes that encourage competition rather than rushing monolithic pieces of legislation that few have read or understand?  It would seem that the biggest beneficiary of existing legislation is not the uninsured who may or may not end up being covered by existing legislation but the SEIU.",1259282450

This is not a trivial issue!<p>Markets are distributed systems that optimize economies for... the kind of behaviors that succeed in the market (in some respects resembling biological evolution, only less stupid and short-sighted).

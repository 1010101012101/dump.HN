But you can, of course, have a bonus which is unconditional, in which case it's just a pay raise.<p>>>>> There's also a difference between a one year contract and getting laid off unexpectedly after one year.<p>There is, but not in money. You could, for example, look in advance for the next gig if you knew. Since there's no way to prepare in advance for higher taxes that would make any difference (not for salarymen - for investors, they already did - tons of companies paid early dividends in 2012, sometimes borrowing to finance it), so it makes no practical difference at all.",1357163933

Both performed well, but PA performed better, and for less cost.<p>2) Clearer Billing Practices\nOne thing that frustrated me about AdRoll was their vague billing methods, especially when you are running multiple campaigns for multiple customers.  AdRoll would build up a ""reseve"" in our account, even though the campaigns weren't exhausting it.  Perfect Audience sends a very clear, detailed summary of the billing each week by campaign, showing what was used the prior week, and what they need to replenish the campaign to get it to the weekly amount.<p>3) Easier UI\nBoth systems have similar UI in terms of the setup, but PA is the winner here.  I like their UTM tag builder, and the way I can differentiate between clients in what I would call ""agency mode.""<p>4) Receptive to Customers\nI thought that PA did a fantastic job of reaching out to customers and getting feedback.  I gave them a few ideas that seemed to get their interest, and I like dealing with companies who value my opinion.<p>As I said earlier, both systems are great platforms, but I prefer to use Perfect Audience for the reasons above.",1357163540

Then you can go to work and without even taking your phone out of your pocket (or even if you forgot it on your bed stand) you can start working with all your same stuff.<p>I believe Apple looks at the problem this way.

In this case what I mean is that I don't want Apple or Dropbox or Google or Canonical to own my data in it's cloud.  I would probably be satisfied with a solution that only stored encrypted data in the cloud so that those data storage providers could not possibly access my data (so they couldn't be allowed to have my encryption key).  I would also be satisfied with a way of hosting a cloud storage platform on my own servers (which would likely be a VPS, so I'd have to encrypt it anyway or else Linode etc. would have my data).<p>If we go the route of using the phone as the center, then we also need to add the capability into the Linux kernel to connect to external computing resources, like CPUs and GPUs.

But that would've been a mistake, because as we can see no OS that depends on one company alone can succeed anymore. Heck, even the ones that depend on several companies are having a very hard time already (WP7/8).<p>And the reason I would've preferred Meego to become the Android alternative, was because it was also an open source OS, and I would've liked more competition between open source OS's, rather than have just an open source one fight against multiple proprietary ones (iOS, WP, WebOS - at the time).<p>So I think there may still be time left for Ubuntu to become that alternative to Android, especially if manufacturers stop relying on WP8 and even Windows 8, and start to focus more on Ubuntu phones and Ubuntu laptops instead. But it's very hard to see if it will actually happen, right now, and if it does happen, we won't see it until 2014-2015.",1357162991

They want research to be free to do research and there is a certain amount of freedom you have to give them but they also have quite a record of saying the best research results in products.  They also, when the research falls in to a greyer area, have let a lot of it go and many times other companies have started up around some of their stuff.  The thinking being that a healthy industry is good for all companies, including IBM and research is part of that.  Never mind the stuff they've documented in journals over the years...   Some of the materials work IBM does is closer to pure research and starts to look like long-term investment type stuff but make no mistake, there are problems they are looking at which the company plans to profit from the solutions.<p>MS seems to have some other problems, productizing their research is part of their problem, in which case they are likely spending way too much on it.  Another, I'm gonna go ahead and say it since it keeps coming up here in different capacities re: IE10 and Windows 8 and other things,  they have negative brand equity with the real early adopters and leading edge geek folks due to their years of treachery and just not being nice.  While kinnect is cool (very very cool, my 2 year old can play games!)  I think I'll wait for Google and Apple to solve the wearable ultra personal computer problems before I'd let MS in to my personal space with some of those phone gadgets.  Their final problem, IMO,  they still sort of don't get it.   Take JPEG-XR,  it's a nice piece of work, they even played nice with ISO and it's a standard of sorts;  good on them for it but why no BSD or Apache licensed free implementation with a written down patent promise?  They planning on drawing funds off that patent?  Or would they like digital cameras to start using that stuff?  Mono is nearly 8 years old and it's sort of used but largely ignored due to MS and potential patent problems,  I think they are very solvable problems.   They just don't play well with a lot of others and that kind of undermines the research, it doesn't matter how cool the invention is if you have to eat the rest of their shit with it.",1357162407

Buying a car to cover the remaining 5% is overkill and would cost way more than to use a Zipcar.

Sure, DIY shops will deliver, for a price. Supermarket delivery can be free but the free delivery slots don't always work out time-wise.

Not in speed, range, and definitely not on cost. It will be that way for a very long time due to the dismal energy density of batteries next to fossil fuels. You know how most powerplants generate power? Turbines, like these GE ones derived from their own jet engines: <a href=""http://www.ge-energy.com/products_and_services/services/gas_turbines_power_generation_services/index.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ge-energy.com/products_and_services/services/gas_...</a> .<p>Higher altitude isn't everything for speed. You need to generate high-speed exhaust to produce thrust. A gas turbine compresses air and burns it so that explosively shoots out the back. How do you generate this electrically without combustion to raise the pressure? You can't just spin the turbine faster; the blade tips will go supersonic and efficiency will plummet, not to mention material stresses. Supersonic wind tunnels mechanically compress air into huge tanks, sometimes taking weeks to store enough pressure for minutes of runtime, but that obviously wouldn't work for aircraft.<p>Jets already produce power efficiently (constantly running at nearly the same RPM, never idling in traffic) so there's much less incentive to create electric aircraft. The cost of energy from an electric aircraft in $/joule could be <i>higher</i> than that of a fueled one because you're introducing an additional energy conversion. Gas/coal -> turbine -> battery -> turbine versus gas -> turbine. You're also not getting the range benefit from burning off fuel and lightening the aircraft.<p>You shift argument from ""aircraft are too slow"" to ""aircraft are too inefficient,"" going electric won't fix either. There are applications for electric aircraft, mainly low-speed, long-endurance aircraft that can recharge from solar power without landing, and perhaps more maintainable private aircraft.

On an implementation level however, it quickly becomes non-simple.<p>One of the fundamental modularity concepts is 'separation of concerns' - this isn't something you always need to do, but when a concern (a scoped set of functionality) grows large, it should be implemented separately, to keep the conceptual complexity of individual abstractions and implementations minimal.<p>If I implement all of the logic for handling conditions, importing data, extracting reports, managing permissions, serialization, and resource handling in the same object, it's a very complicated object. I have no way without getting a full mental model of the thing in my head that changing X about it won't break Y, or what parts of code depend on the structure of the results of calling Z.<p>There are plenty of ways to skin that cat, and different ones are more appropriate in different places.\nOften it's correct to extract the logic into a generalizable mixin, which in Ruby would be a module, and then include it into the class.\nSometimes it's better to extract the logic and the concept it represents into another class that has a relationship with the original one. And sometimes it's better to separate the logic and code into a 'context' as DCI describes - I generally prefer Decorators for this, but the Rails community seems to lean toward using modules here also, largely on the weight of DHH's opinion (app/concerns/).",1357160764

Government granted monopoly is not the only incentive to create something, but there are definitely countless examples of how patents have been used to squash innovation and disruption.<p>I grant that patents have had some positive effects, but I would not assume they are net-positive.  Also, they were primarily designed in a time when there were fewer ideas and getting things into production was much more expensive (this applies to physical things, let along software with zero marginal cost), and it was much easier for an incumbent to steal an idea and crush a startup simply by the barriers to entry to manufacturing and distribution.  Since then lobbying efforts have only pushed intellectual property rights in one direction.  Even medical research patents which are often held up as necessary create perverse incentives that tie up R&D dollars in unproven new drugs, and making arbitrary tweaks to existing newish medicines in order to secure patent protection, making research into natural or public domain compounds come to a standstill regardless of efficacy.<p>Obviously I'm biased since I work in software, but I think we'd be fine without patents.

2813845,comment,2811080,2811888,1,0,kragen,,,"I think you are dramatically overstating the risk at 0.01%.  Suppose past performance predicts future results.  AirBnB has had, what, 10 million rental deals?  And this has only happened, as far as we can tell, once.  That's not an 0.01% risk.  It's more like 0.000001%.<p>Overstating the risk by a factor of ten thousand is a very substantial exaggeration.<p>It's hard for human beings to understand very large and very small numbers, so to put that in context, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_traffic_safety"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_traffic_safety</a> says about ten people are killed per billion vehicle kilometers in most developed countries, so perhaps five people per billion passenger kilometers.

2813844,comment,2812324,2812395,3,0,rdl,,,"All the VC funded startups I've seen compensation for up close are in the 90-120k for what I'd consider junior to middle level non-founder engineers (half that for founders), and maybe 130-160 for individual contributors of great but not legendary caliber (i.e. not hiring Guido to do python dev for 160k, but someone who is quite good, and who could easily be a top tier consultant in that field).<p>These salaries (for VC funded companies after a big A, B, etc,) are about 2x of what I'd consider reasonable (which is a view based on salaries 2001-2005), but being on the employer side, if you have the money, not being willing to pay market is a dumb reason to not get the best talent.  Paying market itself isn't a differentiator, but it's reasonable for an employee to be unwilling to take a substantially below market total comp package.  If you don't have the cash, obviously you need to build in other parts of comp to make up for it (flexibility, being in lower cost areas, higher equity, ...), but it seems like angels and VCs value equity a lot more than employees do, and value cash a lot less, so raising more money to pay the bigger salaries isn't wrong.",1311796756

In my experience, even people with decent internet speed seldom see that speed sustained for the entirety of a large download or stream.<p>A Blu-Ray disk holds 50GB. At a 10Mb/s connection (fairly common in the US), that would take over 11 hours to download, assuming no interruptions. Even at 100Mb/s it would take about an hour. Assuming you're streaming 2 hours of content you only have a 2:1 ratio of play time to download time, and that's still assuming no service interruptions. Most consumer ISPs promote their max burst rate in their packages, but for larger files kick the actual speeds down.<p>But again, there's no reason to assume the situation won't improve in the future, even with the exponential growth in number of devices online and increased usage per device.",1311796628

So I've made a personal choice to not pursue the latest, fastest and most cutting edge algorithms and rather bring my knowledge, experience and problem solving abilities to people who are trying to solve real problems right now.<p>My point is that even though you think you can't compete with these guys who read, study and do 'real' science they could use a lot of help from the likes of you. Sure learning some linear algebra and bayesian statistics can help in directly implementing the algorithm, but usually the biggest problem I've seen is a complete lack of software engineering and hard coding specific to certain data sets.<p>I think the scientists can gain a lot from the software engineering field, especially open source practices. They will be resistant to it, as others have pointed out the incentives don't always line up, on the other hand there is a lot of low-hanging fruit in terms of improvements a decent programmer can pluck.",1311796546

2813813,comment,2813096,2813763,11,0,kenjackson,,,"I don't think so.  Take this statement for example:<p><i>Science needs a new set of ethics. It needs to be clear when reporting medical studies what types of methods were used, what was brought into the study a priori, the sample size, and how it was reviewed.  Scientists should be clear when they are speaking on matters of reproducible science -- such as the absorption spectrum of CO2, the Greenhouse principle, the fact that man changes his environment, and black-body physics -- and when they are totally speculating, like predicting the global temperature in 100 years. These are different types of information. (I hate to use global warming, but it's in vogue.)</i><p>First, Isn't what he wants in medical studies completely standard practice?  I regularly read NEJM and their standard format is: Background, Methods, Results, Conclusion.  I feel like he's getting his medical science from the NYTimes, which is fine as a starting point, but those are articles written by reporters.  Find the actual study to see what the scientist did.<p>Second, if you actually read the ""speculative"" studies, rather than just watching Fox News you'll typically see how they come to the conclusion of the temperature in 100 years.  They detail and construct a model, sometimes via simulation.  It's not that anyone is saying, ""This is what the temperature will be guaranteed"", rather it's saying, ""here's a model we constructed.  We tested it on historical data and it's accurate to this extent.  This is what we see looking forward.  These are the factors that contribute most to this result.""  That's how science is done.  That's how I can hypothesize the sun will come up tomorrow -- I have historical data, I create a model of the solar system, gravity, inertia, etc... and say based on that I think the sun will come up again tomorrow, and based on my models I think it will be colder in the winter than the summer.  What he considers ""speculative"" science is just normal science, but where the models aren't as well understood, and part of science is strengthening the models.<p>I just feel like he doesn't get science at all.  When you don't really understand something, you're more likely to hate it.",1311796355

CGI protects you from HTTP. mod_python and mod_perl protect you from HTTP. If you're unable to read and parse the complete HTTP request yourself -- perhaps incrementally, there's an idea -- you're protected from HTTP. <i>Something</i> is imposing policy like how many headers to accept, what the longest header should be, how to fold multiple headers with the same field-name, that it's okay to consume memory buffering all the headers, and so on.<p>In my ideal world, a web app server has access to the full HTTP request stream, calls an incremental HTTP parser [2] [3], and does whatever it wants along the way. If the typical use case is to accumulate a full request object and call a handler, fine, that can be made convenient. But the web app gets to decide.<p>Perhaps my issue is not with frameworks (in the sense of Django, Ruby, etc), but with web servers. Except, I view the infrastructure for hosting a web app inside a web server as yet another framework. The common use case is optimized for at the expense of the less common use cases, which become more painful than they should be. Or sometimes outright impossible.<p>TL;DR -- Libraries over frameworks.

I'm not really in any position to make these suggestions (or expect them to be followed), so I'm going to more than likely sound crazy.<p>I don't really know what the vision behind Dropbox is, but (in my own opinion) it should be the place where people's personal files are stored. From there, people build cross-platform apps making it more useful. They are already doing this, but they need to take the ""next step"", which is probably what they want to do with their incoming 400 employees.<p>Generally, people store all their files on their home computer, and to solve the problem of ""I can't access my files on the go"" people started using laptops as their primary computer. That's not really a good solution because then you have to carry a computer around. Smartphones and tablets are sort of solving this, but they bring the same overall issue of ""My stuff on here is different from my stuff on there"". What Dropbox could do is host people's actual ""computers"", where computer is defined as software, files, and settings. So when you load up your smartphone or you friends smartphone you can access the smartphone version of your computer, and the tablet version of your computer on tablets, and the desktop version of your computer on desktops.<p>It wouldn't feel like you're using ""your laptop"" or ""your friends tablet"" or ""your iPhone"" because the only difference between any kind of computer is whose signed in right now. Dropbox is in a favorable position to do this, but so is Apple, Google, and Microsoft.<p>It's a pretty crazy (and unlikely) notion, but how else will Dropbox grow?",1311795802

It's about positioning people in an ornamental, demeaning way and calling it ""good fun"" and ""humor.""</i>\n> <i>That is what makes it sexist, because is reduced to, literally, a pair of tits and under the greater context of ""Google is Sexy.""</i><p>So it's sexist against the woman but not the guys who are literally reduced to shirts that bear the Google logo?<p>That's my objection with the claim that this is sexist.  If we claim that the woman is reduced to being a pair of breasts, then we must also claim that the men are reduced to being nothing but a couple of shirts.  It's only through a biased interpretation that we can come to the conclusion that the woman is an object while the men are not.  The mere fact that she's sexy should not mean she is an object.<p>It's only through our own biases that we can call this photo demeaning to women.  Is it demeaning to men when Anthony Weiner's underwear photos are shown, or when David Beckham is photographed shirtless?  Is it demeaning to men when women take pictures with attractive men or famous male athletes?  If not, why the double standard?  (Isn't unequal treatment the very definition of sexism?)  And if so, then does ""demeaning"" have any meaning at all, besides reflecting a discomfort with human sexuality in general?<p>> Nobody is arguing that just posting a pic of an attractive woman is sexist.<p>It seems that the set of contexts in which Tom could post a picture of a woman showing cleavage without being called sexist is pretty small.  Somehow I suspect that if his post had instead included a picture of a guy in a thong, no one would have called it sexist.<p>> I noticed you didn't answer my question, though: What message do you think this sends to potential CS coeds?<p>I don't think this sends a message to potential female CS students.  The fact that one guy posted a picture shouldn't mean much, and I think a relatively small percentage of women would actually find this offensive.  (How many women have posted cleavage shots of themselves to Facebook?)  I also think that it's bizarre that anyone would hold Tom Anderson up as some sort of ambassador for the software industry.<p>By the way, coed means coeducational and refers to males and females educated together.

Fox is a broadcast network (ad supported) that one doesn't need to subscribe to in order to receive.<p>However, broadcast channels do make money through re-transmission rights that they sell to cable and satellite carriers.  It might seem silly that your cable company is paying Fox for programming you can already get over the air, but the cable company also knows that their service won't be as attractive to you if the don't also carry your local channels without the need for an antenna.  By confirming that you subscribe to Comcast, DISH Network, or something else, they know that they're receiving more revenue than just ads from you - they're also getting the re-transmission fees from your paid service.<p>There can also be the perception that if you're paying for TV, you're likely to watch it sometimes even if you use the internet TV for some of your TV watching.  I'm guessing Hulu isn't getting advertisers to shell out as much money as traditional TV is right now.  So, if you subscribe to cable or satellite, they might not be making a lot on what you're watching on Hulu, but at least they know you're more likely to be watching programming that they do get better money off of.<p>I'm definitely not defending the move and I don't subscribe to pay-TV myself, but I can understand why they'd make the move.  Subscribers to pay-TV bring them revenues directly through the re-transmission fees and indirectly through a greater likelihood of watching non-internet programming with more ad slots that pay higher.  If ""cutting the cord"" becomes the norm, it could mean lower margins and greater competition in programming for Fox and others.  That's good for consumers, but I can see why Fox would try to stop that.",1311794367

Isn't it useful to discover the negatives as well as the positives?<p>I've been a customer of 23andme for 3 years, and they've always been very forthright about providing guidance on what you really could discern from the results they provide, including a measure of the strength of the scientific evidence that provided probabilities of you getting this disease or that one.<p>Personally, the highlights for me where when my Brother, Mother, Niece and Nephew tossed their results into 23andme, and it instantly identified them as relatives, and what their relationship to me was - without any last names or locations to go on.  (Though admittedly, my niece and nephew were identified as ""Niece/Aunt, Nephew/Uncle)<p>I've been happy with the sober, reasonable, and conservative approach that 23andme has taken.    ""Genewatch"" on the other hand, sounds like they have an axe to grind - they certainly lost credibility with me based on the comments I read.  Not sure what their issue is...",1311793476

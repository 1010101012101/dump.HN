60241,comment,59990,60205,0,0,robg,,,"I know this exists because I've seen to happen and I shudder every time. But it's not just just ""neurobabble"". It's possible to obfuscate in any domain. The problem is: You can never be certain of what's babble and what's real without doing the intellectual heavy lifting yourself. In neuroscience, my ability to see a poorly designed study is only as good as the methods and theories get closer to what I know. So I decline being a reviewer of manuscripts if I don't know enough to sufficiently judge them.",1190899679

I never quite heard it said like that, but I agree.<p>Lessons learned from mistakes I made (and you shouldn't):<p>1.  If they say they won't engage you because of your price, it's not because of your price.  Find out the real reason.<p>2.  If they're shopping on price, let them.  You don't want them.<p>3.  If you won't compromise your quality, then you shouldn't compromise your price.<p>4.  If they legitimately can't afford it, then reduce scope, not price.<p>5.  If you charge top dollar, you better deliver top quality.  Otherwise, don't be surprised when word gets around and the well dries up.\n",1190899568
60238,comment,59990,60167,0,0,robg,,,"Short, simple story (which is tough for an academic!): Sensory brain systems support perceptual knowledge. That is, when you think about apples you activate regions involved in perceiving taste and color. For cotton, you rely more on tactile areas used during touch. And thinking about the sound of a shotgun activates a sound region. These patterns even seem to explain how you understand television when you're watching the Discovery Channel vs Martha Stewart vs This Old House (work we're preparing for publishing). Your brain appears to simulate the experience as if you were right there participating in it whether you're dealing with a word, picture, or video.<p>Now that ""British Empiricist"" story only seems to work for perceptual concepts. When things get more abstract, it breaks down (as the Rationalists pointed out). For instance, I would love to figure out how the squishy grey stuff can produce a concept like ""infinity"". But we're even making centipede steps there. For instance, we have a paper out showing that even for simple facts about animals, the use of language to code knowledge helps to overcome perceptual inadequacies and these facts seem to rely more on the frontal lobe.<p>That all said, we're going to spend a long time refining all of these accounts and none will fully explain the meanderings of the great philosophers. The point is we are making progress (and answering some philosophical problems) and I could spend the rest of my life simply trying to understand how the brain supports our knowledge of the world.<p>For more see: \nGoldberg, R.F., Perfetti, C.A., Fiez, J.A., Schneider, W.

I agree with pretty much all you have to say here.<p>What I think is ""stupid"" is not your article, but the fact that some programmers don't like relational databases (for whatever reason).  I'll try to pick my words and make my point more carefully in the future.<p>I understand much of the theory behind these technologies, but, as a practitioner, I'm not in a position to base my actions solely upon theory.  I HAVE to deliver.  I wish I had a nickel for every benchmark I've conducted over the years.  You may have noticed that I tend to avoid theoretical debate here; I'm more interested in what works.<p>And relational databases work very well, very often.

60231,comment,59990,60101,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Is it a journey of self-discovery? Or were those people simply the right people to make the observations they did?<p>I would be careful with cause and effect. It may be that brain structures allow one person, say, a greater ability to see in the dark and notice the tiger that is about to pounce while another cannot. But the tiger is not a result of that person. The observation of the tiger is a result of brain structure or whatever. The tiger exists with or without the person noticing it.<p>\nThis is beginning to set off my BS alarm, but suffice it to say that philosophers seem to have made discoveries quite apart from the structure of their brains or personalities. They've also indulged in a lot of pontificating and wondering about based on their unique brain structures, no doubt. But I would be careful in using neuroscience to explain philosophy. I've read some studies that show that some brains are more conservative than others, and some are more liberal. This might be really cool in 100 years once all the noise comes out of the experiments, but for now, it poses more of a danger than a benefit to the layreader, imo. We're just at the stage of correlation. Nobody that I know of is talking about causation for some of these higher-order effects.",1190898120

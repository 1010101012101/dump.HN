The US spends more per capita on Medicare than Canadians do on healthcare - you'd think they would want to try to fix that before they tried to ""extend coverage"" and force everyone to participate in a public system.  I should point out further though that the Canadian model is less than sustainable.  As I've mentioned to others in the past, it took me over 6 months to book a physical and unless you know people access to specialists is a very lengthy wait.",1263423598

Before a bank can lend money to a customer, it has to receive money from another customer. During any given business day they may end up lending more money than they received (or vice versa), but at the end of the day they just borrow it in the overnight Fed Funds market (or lend the excess).

So health care, on an aggregate basis anyhow, is actually <i>much</i> more expensive in the USA than Canada.<p>Secondly is the burden on the individual - I did the taxes for what I would have to pay in taxes in Canada (if I had earned the income there), and the total comes out to about $2K more than my tax burden in the USA. Considering my insurance (employer-subsidized) is still some $100 a month, the difference becomes even less pronounced. Not to mention there's no such thing as a co-pay in Canada (my US insurance plan has mediocre co-pays).

So this site solves the hard work of hand-stylizing their car in forums. Everything is easy to add and update.

The natives in the area were notably not fond of each other and regularly used Europeans to acquire the means to slaughter their enemies.<p>Before the arrival of the Europeans, relations between the Huron and the Iroquois consisted of constant, low-level warfare (which could be brutal, and involved post facto ritual torture).<p>So in the early-mid 17th century, the French traders were generally allied to the Huron, while the Iroquois were allies of the Dutch, then English. Both sides sought trade monopolies with the Europeans, but the Iroquois, the Mohawk in particular, acquired heavy armaments first. They then used those armaments to slaughter, and in fact, pretty much eliminate the Huron. (I'm glossing over a lot of detail.

We work extensively on-site for Fortune 500 enterprises, in some of the highest-security environments in the world (and in some of the most idiosyncratic and crazy), and none of them require us to install bespoke certificates to access the Internet or their websites.

If I have offended you, I apologize, that was not my intention.<p>I have been down the ""take the plunge"" route before, as I alluded in my earlier comment.  I watched my savings dwindle and ultimately had to wind down the startup after 3 and a half long years.  So while I don't expect you to understand my point of view, your comment comes across as overly general and fairly inflammatory.<p>I am a long time follower of Steve Blank.  I own and have read Four Steps to the Epiphany several times.  He makes it clear in the book, and it is alluded to in that post that Customer Development is a discovery process.  It's not yet clear that you have discovered a viable business model and/or how long it will take you to reach profitability.  During that early stage, he explicitly recommends avoiding raising money because of all of the complications it brings.<p>The gist of my first post was that I cannot tell from your post or your graph alone if you have discovered a repeatable scalable business system, and you are just funneling your savings to husband your cash and accelerate the growth of your company.  If that is the case, then I heartily congratulate you and wish you all the success in the world.<p>If on the other hand you are living on your savings in the hope that you can refine and discover your business plan, and you can't fairly solidly project your growth - then in my estimation, that is an unwise use of your savings.  But as I said, that is a personal choice.  At this stage of the game I have a wife and a son, and while I'm willing to gamble on success, I'm not willing to gamble on putting them on the street in the ""hopes"" that I've hit on a successful business.  Yes, my business will progress more slowly, and my customer development does not progress as rapidly as I like, but for me, that is an acceptable price to pay at this time of my life.<p>Anyway, I wish you luck with your venture.

Not accounting for inflation, nominal GDP grew about 8,000 bln from 1990-2000, which is paralleled in only 5 years between 2000-2005.<p>As for corruption, I don't think you've done much to further your argument that ""China has been a historical corrupt society for thousands of years"".  Benefiting from close ties to the government is a natural economic condition found in every country.  Hello US Lobbying industry?<p>And the percentage of multi-millionaires with close family connections doesn't say much either, only that China has a growing class of oligarchs, again a condition found in many many many other countries.<p>That said, it wouldn't be fair for me to wholly dismiss your points.  Yes corruption is widespread, but I don't see how that proves your point that China as a society has been utilizing corruption to cheat their business partners for thousands of years.  That is an absurd point that is not at all grounded in history nor facts.<p>Finally I think you mis-understood my point in regards to S. Korea/Japan.  They have had LONGER to grow economically in the sense that until the mid 1970s China was essentially a collapsed country, with really NO economy.  Irregardless of time, both S. Korea and Japan grew their economies out of authoritarian governments.  S. Korea was for most of the latter half of the 20th century a military state and Japanese politics was dominated by a single party.  Both not exactly what I would call open democratic regimes.<p>No idea what you mean by ""a non 'free-market' system is a better approach when it's provided such poor returns..."", can you define ""poor returns""?  China has been one of the fastest growing economies for the past 30 years.  How is that poor returns?  In fact, its the very authoritarian regime you lambast as being economically inefficient that has been cited as the source of China's seemingly ""magical"" growth.<p>Lastly, you absolutely CANNOT ignore China's massive population when analyzing the country's current and future states.  Having to support a nation of 1.3 billion people is an epically difficult task and as I state in a prior comment, ALL problems in China derive from its population problem.<p>Anyways the point of all of this is not to defend China.  The hyperbole and level of mis-understanding among the HN community in regards to China is absurd.  This is not a good/bad issue.  China's problems are nuanced, just like all things in life.

A million dollar act can cause billions of dollars of damage (e.g. 9/11) causing a many trillion dollar response (our current wars) and we haven't even seen the first real acts of biological terrorism. And what would become of a human population consisting of one group willing to take responsibility for the finiteness of our world, and one group unwilling to do so, intent on expansion, growth, greed and reproduction. There must be some moral code, some mode of thinking, some sociological structure, to deal with this.<p>(PS: Are you really that keen on thorium? People can still make dirty bombs and I'm not sure about how secure it is in terms of preventing enrichment, and as far as I can tell it's more expensive in terms of amortized cost than uranium reactors, which are more expensive than coal, which in some cases is more expensive than wind and, possibly soon, solar.

It's just one in a long list of limitations in terms of the planet's resources. We fix more nitrogen than all of other life in the planet combined. Human beings have reshaped one third of the Earth's surface. About one billion people on Earth now enjoy an 'american' standard of living, and thusly an american standard of consumption. In 20 years it will be <i>3 billion</i>. We don't really have room for another factor of three, even just looking at the amount of food that we'll need. At the currently level of technology, for example, it is not even remotely possible for south and south east asia to switch from a largely vegetarian diet to one which consumes half as much meat as the average american.<p>---<p>I highly recommend the article ""A Sober Optimist’s Guide to Sustainability""<p><a href=""http://sloanreview.mit.edu/beyond-green/a-sober-optimists-guide-to-sustainability/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sloanreview.mit.edu/beyond-green/a-sober-optimists-gu...</a><p>""The guiding principle of more: It’s interesting to imagine what it would take to change that principle, even by degree. Because making that change seems so fundamental to what you’re saying we’re going to have to do.<p>I think this is the most difficult issue. And it’s not one you can tell people about. But you can show them.
One of the simulation models we use is a model of the overall interactions between population, resources, pollution, technology, and the environment. We’ll run the model live in class. We’ll say, “Okay, here is the simulation, and some very unpleasant things may happen yet in this century. But everything in the model is uncertain. Let’s assume there’s a whole lot more cheap oil and gas available. The marginal cost doesn’t rise so quickly as we pump more out of the ground.” Then you just slide a lever in the model and instantly see the result.<p>What happens, of course, is that by relaxing the constraint that’s limiting economic growth by lowering the availability and raising the price of energy, the economy grows even more, for an even longer time, until it hits some other constraint. So if you relax the constraint on the availability of fossil fuels, then you hit another constraint, which might be climate change. And if you go in and you relax that constraint, even magically assuming we can solve the climate problem right now, and for free, the economy grows even further until you hit another constraint, such as soil fertility or fresh water, and you see agricultural productivity fall. Relax that constraint, and you’ll grow until you hit some other one.<p>Pretty quickly people discover for themselves that as long as everybody in the world wants more—as long as everyone in the world wants to be as rich as we are, and we all want to be richer than we are today, there’s no solution.<p>What makes it particularly hard is that this is a conversation that’s not permissible in our society. Even the English language doesn’t allow it! There are words for not having enough—shortage—but there’s no word for excess demand. There’s no such word as a “longage” of demand.""",1263420406

This prevents you from having to pay your lawyer to review Yet Another NDA.<p>2. Ask for the bidirectional NDA instead of the unidirectional one most companies start with. A 2-way NDA is usually more reasonable because both parties are bound by it so no one wants to screw themselves over.<p>3. Work out the NDA separate from any contract terms. An NDA should not establish a business relationship.<p>4. Always ALWAYS have an expiration date, both of the NDA and any confidential information disclosed under it. This way you only have to keep track of the last N years of NDAs, not infinity. Also, this limits the risk of someone unreasonable coming to power in a company in the future and using the NDA against you. Life changes, nothing should last forever.",1263420106

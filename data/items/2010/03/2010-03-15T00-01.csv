If you have a high-performance online transaction processing app, then this could be great.  But if you just have a terabyte of porn, you are wasting your money.  Disks (and even tape) handle this workload just fine.<p>For a boot drive, 30G ought to be enough.  I only use 7G on my desktop and about 4G on my laptop:<p><pre><code>    Filesystem             Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/mapper/ssd-root    28G  6.9G   19G  27% /
    /dev/mapper/md0_crypt  917G  331G  587G  37% /home
</code></pre>
No reason to pay $3000 for a 1T SSD when a 30G SSD + 1T hard drive will give you the exact same performance for 1/10th the cost.  (I have 3 drives in md0_crypt, and so it ends up being as fast as an SSD too.  The bottleneck on both disks is the crypto; apparently i7s don't have hardware-accelerated AES, but the i5s do.  Grumble.)",1268614746

About half-way down, the author makes a really cool point -- all the ideas seem to be coming together and this text just jumps off the page. You highlight the paragraph and enter it into my app, choosing also to share it on Twitter and  FB.<p>You're looking for something pithy to tweet or put on your FB status. You visit my app and read the latest quotes from sources all over the world, sorted and ranked especially according to your tastes. Choosing the one you like the most, you upvote it, make a comment, and choose to automatically email it and post to your status updates.<p>You're looking for the best of the web today. Visiting my app, quotes from much longer articles and speeches are listed, customized to your tastes. Finding one that looks especially interesting, you click the link and go to the longer article, spending 10 or 20 minutes reading the full text.<p>Your friend hears something incredible at a news event. He quotes the speaker, links to the video, and notifies you by using my app. You visit his quote on my app, make some comments, and vote it up. Soon you and your friend have made several comments -- other people have also joined in. Your conversation about this quote is saved for you to return to when you like.<p>Finally, you're reading a book on your Kindle or other device. You find a particularly interesting passage. Quickly you copy it out, tag and save it, perhaps also choosing to share it on your status update. Later on, when you are not at your e-book reader, you can visit the web site and view your quotes -- along with the comments from your social network and other folks who share your same interest.<p>Does that describe it well enough?",1268613222

The percentages of success are very low.<p>Applying to YC was fairly easy and didn't take much time. There's really only upside to it. The only downside is your ego when you're rejected and the remote chance that your idea/startup would be undervalued.<p>I also disagree with your final notion that YC is THE yardstick for success. If you read their ""whynot"" post, it's obvious they go through very many applications and really your idea could be skimmed and rejected quite easily. Also, the companies that have come out of YC haven't ALL been successful (no discredit to those that have been).<p>Lastly, at such an early stage I think entrepreneurs are always thinking through changes in business/people/idea. That's just the nature of the beast whether YC accepted you or not.",1268611477

The point at which, say, twice that level of storage drops to less than $100 in SSD format makes a strong economic case for widespread consumer adoption.

The servers are functionally similar yet the source code footprint of ejabberd is approximately 300 files at 5MB and openfire is approximatley 4000 files at 100MB. The erlang server has more then an order of magnitude less code.",1268611396

Otherwise it won't work. You have to invest in it emotionally.<p>When things start to go wrong you just won't admit it, and think that it must be the market, the customers, the investors. Anything...<p>The thing is that the line between failure and success is a very fine one, and it is hard to tell which side you are on. Basically you don't know until you either failed, or succeded. Eventually you have to realise you failed, give up your baby and move on. But it is really really hard because you invested so much in it emotionally, told your friends and family about it, convinced yourself that this would make you rich and famous, and all that.<p>I don't think you can really prepare well for it though.",1202043309

The WSJ's article is nothing but parroting of SG's press releases. They are hard at work trying to save their asses, and everybody in the industry agrees that JKE could not have done what he did without his managers knowing, and furthermore, that he is now made into a scapegoat. WSJ is right about one thing: they are full of hubris.",1202042925

It allows users to modify your question and tags and some of them misunderstand your question or just don't want it there.  One of my questions received no answers, many followers hoping for an answer, and 13 edits removing tags and changing the question to be something completely different from what it was.  In other words, it can be abused.",1282327196

Designing in a committee has been a freaking nightmare.""<p>I completely agree.  Yet in industry, being that one person (like I am) leads to great management consternation to the tune of ""what if you're hit by the proverbial bus?"" which leads to ""you need an understudy"", which leads to expending 2x the resources to achieve <2x results (the time spent selecting, training and guiding an understudy is definitely nowhere near 0, even when the choice of understudy turns out to have been a good one), and there can't help but be some feeling of ""training your replacement"".

You explain that you didn't have a contract drawn up, and that Fred's justification for not sharing proceeds from the company sale was that, after all, it was his money invested. I'm sorry, but if money invested was the only determinant factor in a company's success VC's would simply produce hits every week. Also, you may still feel some misplaced guilt/responsibility/loyalty to that venture, even in hindsight, but to me, looking at it as an outsider, it appears you contributed around 80% of the overall value to that company. Even Fred wasn't delusional enough to believe the company wouldn't crash and burn without you. You also say Fred was the ""driving force"" of the company. Yeah, sure, but he was riding on top of you doing the driving. This was a great and graphic story, and I'm glad you choose to look at the benefits of knowledge you took away from it, but man, that Fred seems a real charlatan/a-hole.",1282326796

1621053,comment,1620312,1620806,0,0,ewjordan,,,"<i>Perhaps the disconnect here is that Kurzweil, operating from an information theory perspective, is neglecting the possibility that the biological environment in which a brain grows effectively adds a ton of ""data"" to the system</i><p>Please realize, despite the fact that pretty much everyone on HN is repeating this argument (the ""data gets added to the system"" argument), it is an extraordinary claim, and should require correspondingly extraordinary evidence if we're to consider it.<p>I'm going to justify this in <i>excruciating</i> detail, because the claim has now come up so many times.<p>But first, let's nail down the context, because if we can't agree on that then we really shouldn't even be discussing the topic (and I suspect the whole problem here is that Myers thinks they're arguing about something other than what Kurzweil is actually claiming) - we're discussing the amount of information that we would need to construct an effective intelligent algorithm.  Not one particular algorithm, but <i>any</i> effective intelligent algorithm.<p>Here goes, a pseudo-mathematical breakdown of why this ""data gets added"" argument is so hideously wrong:<p>There's an entire infinite universe of ""possible intelligence algorithms"" (for the moment, we won't define this too precisely, but we'll hand wave and say that this universe consists of all algorithms that take the right inputs and provide the right outputs, whatever those are), most of which are utterly useless, and are certainly not intelligent.  Let's call this universe U0.<p>Step one: let's cut U0 down to a finite practical size, eliminating ridiculous algorithms that we could never expect to implement.  We can do this in a million ways, it doesn't really matter; for now, let's just say that we're cutting it down to algorithms that have possible physical realizations using the resources on our planet.  That's still a huge number of algorithms.  Call this U1.<p>Step two: Let's now trim U0 in a different way, picking out only the algorithms that we consider <i>actually</i> intelligent, however you want to define ""intelligent"".  Name this (still infinite) set Z.<p>Step three: Take the intersection of Z (intelligent algorithms) with U1 (practical algorithms), call this set P.  P is all the practical algorithms that qualify as ""intelligent"".<p>Now let Prob(I) = (size of P / size of U1), the probability that a randomly selected practical algorithm will be intelligent.  This is an extremely small probability, but it's finite and non-zero (human intelligence suffices to prove that it's non-zero).<p>Step four: Now we slice up U1 in a different way, and create a set D_N: the set of all algorithms that can be specified by growing a human from a string of DNA of length N (and that ultimately run within the space constraints).<p>Step five: Set P(D_N) = intersection of D_N and P, all intelligent algorithms satisfying the space constraints that can be grown from a DNA string of length N.<p>Ok, that's a lot of sets, but it's okay, we don't need most of them.  One last calculation:<p>Prob(D_N) = (size of P(D_N) / size of D_N), the probability that a randomly selected practical DNA-created algorithm will be intelligent.<p>No more set-fu, I promise.  We've boiled it down to two probabilities, Prob(I), and Prob(D_N).  These probabilities are proxies for the information content needed to pick an intelligent algorithm out of the corresponding sets of algorithms.<p>The ""information gets added"" claim has a very simple mathematical expression:<p>Prob(D_N) > Prob(I) when N = the length of human DNA<p>i.e. a randomly selected DNA-created algorithm with DNA length N has a greater probability of qualifying as intelligent than a randomly selected algorithm in general.  And not just a little bit greater - you're saying that the fact that it's implemented via DNA makes the probability <i>much</i> higher, corresponding to the data difference you're claiming with the statement 'far, far more than 50MB of ""data"" here'.<p>Perhaps now you see the trouble: in order for me to consider the ""data gets added"" argument plausible, I need to hear an argument that suggests that a random construction based on DNA is far more likely to lead to an intelligent algorithm than a random construction in general.<p>Myers has not offered an argument in this direction.  Neither has anyone else.  Until someone does, the odds are overwhelmingly in Kurzweil's favor; statistically speaking, Myers is flat out wrong.<p>So I put the question to everyone: what's so special about the DNA construction process that makes it so much more likely to create intelligence than any other construction process we might conceive of?",1282326752

1621032,comment,1620335,1620335,0,0,willheim,,,"A couple of points to make here:<p>1)  A start-up is just a business of your own design.  It may be that you're in tech but the whole concept of running the business side of things is really no different from opening your own restaurant, dry cleaners, or becoming some sort of contractor or realtor.  You are self employed and must rely on yourself to bring home the bacon.  The vast majority of people in the world are in this position (and create the most jobs according to the latest surveys).<p>2) Work is not life if you also wish to have a family.  If you prioritize work over family then you are bound to fail at one or both.  Through proper time/resource management you can enjoy both immensely and successfully.<p>I have a wife and two kids.  They do take up (I mean, deserve and I enjoy giving) a lot of time.  Having a family is incredibly exciting and there ar joys to be found there that cannot be found anywhere else.  If, however, you prioritize work over them you will quickly find yourself on the road to an unhappy household.  I know far too many who ended up in divorce and have nothing but regrets for the opportunity they squandered there.<p>A very wise and successful entrepreneur once remarked to me when I asked them about balancing work and family that I would likely make as much money as I did even if I didn't work as long as I did.  It's not about putting in all those hours.  It's about putting in smarter hours, delegating and optimizing.  Take your vacations, hire interns, and enjoy your life (not at the expense of the business or the family).<p>Oh, and one more VERY important point:  Marry someone who knows your tendencies to be an entrepreneur (ie risk taker) and will support you through thick and thin (and when things get too thin have the sense to stop),  The biggest problems always start when the partner does not support the rolling of the dice.  Family must always come first.  Always.",1282326268

Therefore there is little logical relationship between how far back the speciation event was, and when the mitochondrial 'Eve' happened.<p>That said, the theory of punctuated equilibrium predicts that speciation tends to take place in small, isolated populations that are a potential mitochondrial bottleneck as well.  But that bottleneck is not necessarily going to lead to a mitochondrial 'Eve'.  And when the new species spreads out, it may breed true but it is not necessarily entirely reproductively isolated.

1620927,comment,1620264,1620264,0,0,AmitinLA,,,"I come from a similar situation and faced similar challenges, especially after trying to launch a web startup with no financing and no developers on board. It failed. I'm determined to stay in tech, so here's some of my  (occasionally conflicting) thoughts.<p>1) You call yourself a business guy, but are you a product guy? If you're a product guy -- if you can understand the soul of a product and how it interacts with people -- that can be inherently valuable. In my experience, most people I've met may be ""tech"" or ""business"", but they're not product people.<p>2) Get an internship. Beg. Show up, prove why you're valuable, send unsolicited resumes with advice and biz dev/product suggestions. Be humble, but not too much. Work for free for a couple months, or at minimum wage or whatever is legal. Just get your foot in the door.<p>3) Read. The Elements of User Experience (<a href=""http://amzn.to/aFNjSn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amzn.to/aFNjSn</a>), The Mythical Man Month (<a href=""http://amzn.to/cFLDlB"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amzn.to/cFLDlB</a>) -- these are just to get you started. Learning to code a little bit will be good as well. The point is not to become an expert developer, but to learn how developers think. Think of your reading as travel literature and learn about different cultures.<p>4) Look for non-sexy opportunities. Twitter, FB, 4SQ, Zynga etc., get all the hype, but there's tons of need for software development and product design in what I call the ""iceberg industries."" The trucking industry brings in $250 billion dollars in revenue every year. That's almost twice the size of the airline industry and yet a typical website of theirs looks like this: <a href=""http://www.highwayfreight.com/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.highwayfreight.com/index.php</a><p>5) Think about CPG (even though it's not tech, it still can be a startup). It's a risky, tough move and faces lots of market forces, but can be incredibly lucrative. You could find a small local product that you believe in, invest some cash to get equity, and try to make them big. As a consultant, your skills may be valuable because the problems in these types of entrepreneurial efforts are operational problems, not innovation problems.<p>6) Don't worry too much about the idea or where you're working right now: your goal is to build professional and personal credibility. Give away your great ideas. Most people who have them don't tend to have just one.<p>7) Don't worry about home runs. Most entrepreneurs I know have small lifestyle businesses and love their companies no matter the size. It's kinda like having a kid. S/he's probably not going to grow up to be president, but you're going to love 'em anyway.",1282324114

Do research on which of the big American tech hubs (Austin, Boston, NYC, Silicon Valley, etc.) are looking the most active in terms of hiring. Move to that place and start seeking a job -- as a PR professional. Now, granted, by the time a startup is seeking a dedicated and experienced PR professional, they're beyond the ""five guys working to hack together a product"" stage. However, those are the kinds of people I want to work with, not 50-year-olds grinding out their remaining work years sitting in an office.<p>I cannot imagine working in a corporate environment for more than a couple years.

For example, if a booking site has found me a $300 nonstop ticket it's probably not necessary to show me the 3-stop, $1700 option. Yet they all do because nobody has taken the time to filter down the results to the practical options (the user could create a filter, but that's just another option to deal with).

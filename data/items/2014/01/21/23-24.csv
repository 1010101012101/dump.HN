7099576,comment,7096466,7099483,1,0,sdegutis,,,"I should point out that, as I said in the other thread, I&#x27;m Catholic. And I didn&#x27;t just inherit my Catholicism, I worked hard to find it. And I examined many of its precepts and tenets (including birth control), and found them each to be reliable and founded on a mountain of logic built on a kernel of faith. So they&#x27;re my own beliefs. Not inherited, and not held blindly.<p>That&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t support the inclusion of contraception anywhere, among other things. I&#x27;m well aware that in some people&#x27;s eyes this makes me an enemy of women, an enemy of the poor, etc. But I stand by my views without shame or regret, because I have acquired and maintain them with all the integrity I can muster.",1390348767

Bias certainly plays into it, but the larger problem is the fundamental nature of news reporting. The central fallacy is the idea that watching the news is a way to become informed about what&#x27;s happening in the world. That&#x27;s utterly false, it only informs you of some of the more notable or unusual events in the world, while largely ignoring more complex and long term developments.",1390348729

Much like them; we barely cover our costs.  But we&#x27;ve largely automated away most human effort so that we can keep the site going for our community while we figure out a brighter future for it.<p>While our game is similar; I think the way we have approached it from the business standpoint is more realistic.  We fully bootstrapped it ourselves and never put ourselves in a position where it had to make money.  All of the people working on it still have day jobs.  We see Doodle or Die as a great side project that we will continue to work on and maybe we will get it enough traction to attract a buyer.  As much as we want it to be the next DrawSomething we knew that it would be a hard road towards that and therefore we were never holding our breath.<p>There is something to be said for going out and taking the bigger risk like DrawQuest did.  But I think we have all agreed to save our bigger risks for bigger opportunities (i.e. we are all working at successful startups outside of Doodle Or Die that have a much better future).  We never took the risk; and that&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t see us writing a blog about our failure.  With all that being said we welcome DrawQuest users to try out Doodle Or Die.",1390348634

It&#x27;s typically not redeemable for anything else, as a gold-backed one (USD from 1944 to Nixon) is.<p>And really, a currency like gold is valuable because it has a fixed supply and is universally accepted. Bitcoin has a fixed supply and is rapidly moving towards universal acceptance. It&#x27;s totally different when a government chooses to make a dollar worth approximately X much and then prints 85 billion of them per month.<p>So, yeah, gold isn&#x27;t a fiat currency.

We live well within our means (2 cheap cars, no cable tv, eat-in most days of the week, ...), but the idea of having to pay for a ridiculous mortgage to live in a safe area with good schools, pay for a nanny to take care of our kids because we work so many hours, having to save for our retirement, saving for our kids&#x27; educations scares the hell out of me, and puts a freeze on any extraneous spending of money.

You don&#x27;t often have billionaires initiating a communication campaign and articles about charities, and attracting that much attention.<p>I don&#x27;t think Bill Gates would really like to answer the question &quot;when did you encounter politics in that work, and what was good and what was not ?&quot;, because I don&#x27;t think that he&#x27;s a very political guy, but at least he has enormous talent for everything else.<p>I honestly thinks that diplomacy and politics can immensely help charities.

See /g/&#x27;s &quot;battlestation&quot; threads (incredibly decked-out computer rooms), the girls of the cosplay board who spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on costumes and obscure fashion, the people who travel to Japan twice a year to buy pornographic comic books at Comiket, and so on.<p>I think there are opportunities to be found here, but you have to be an active member of some board to know what its needs are, and even then it would involve a lot more elbow grease than achieving success among a less savvy userbase might. Just making an app and buying some ads isn&#x27;t going to get you anywhere. There <i>is</i> precedent here, however, in indie game development, where it&#x27;s fairly common at this point for new devs to be 4chan users who get most of their early attention and users from threads on /v/ or the amateur game development generals.<p>EDIT: Some random ideas for small businesses or small startups that could be marketed to 4chan effectively:<p>Retro console repair and modding services would be popular on the retro games board.<p>The fan translation scenes for anime, manga, and video games are mostly controlled by 4chan users at this point. Many of these groups could go legit with some funding (see Crunchyroll, which was basically an anime fansubbing group that got the funding to acquire broadcast rights for simulcasted subtitled anime and grew very quickly, or Carpe Fulgur, two goons that translate Japanese indie games).<p>Import services are an obvious choice. Indeed, jlist has been advertising with 4chan almost since its inception, and there&#x27;s no reason there couldn&#x27;t be more competition in this space.",1390348185

This is especially true when it comes to long term socio-economic development. Look at the South Korea portrayed on the TV show &quot;M.A.S.H.&quot;, that&#x27;s the South Korea of the 1950s, and to some extent it was still a common view of South Korea when the show aired in the late &#x27;70s and early &#x27;80s. But from 1980 to 1990 South Korea&#x27;s GDP tripled, and from 1990 to 2000 it more than doubled, and it did so again from 2000 to 2010. Today the people in South Korea are not just richer, per person, than Americans were in 1950 they are richer than Americans were in 1980, when M.A.S.H. was on the air. That sort of thing is very difficult to conceptualize, because humans are just generally not good at understanding geometric growth.<p>But the same trends are happening elsewhere. Mexico, for example, is becoming wealthier. If they can sort out their huge political and security problems in their country then they can easily join the developed world soon. The same goes for Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and China. And a decade from now there will be yet more countries who will have moved into firing distance of becoming a developed country too, and even more countries moving out of poverty and into the developing world as well. In 2050 there are many parts of the world that we will put in the same mental bucket of development status as the US/Europe et al today, places like Morocco, the Philippines, even Nigeria.<p>One of the problems people often have with history is lack of perspective and cultural bias. People can be exposed to countless portrayals of historical poverty and lack of development in America&#x27;s past, for example, and yet still fail to draw a line of similarity to undeveloped or developing parts of the world today.

It did NOT let her off the hook for defamation.  This is very important.  Journalists can still commit defamation.  The district court convicted her of that, but <i>it used the wrong test</i> because it assumed that she&#x27;s not a journalist.<p>So what does this decision mean exactly?  For Crystal Cox it means that the case will be retried in district court, this time using a more precise definition of libel.  I think it is highly likely that her conviction will stand.<p>For the rest of us it&#x27;s a precedent that modernizes first-amendment protections for the Internet age, the attainment of which was well worth the defense of a scoundrel.",1390347108

That&#x27;s a problem, too. It&#x27;s just not a <i>feminist</i> problem.<p>> Second, much of feminism ignores the question of why one-to-one gender representation is desirable in the first place for each and every position of power.<p>> Well, the man is still the most objectively skilled person for the job maybe you should figure out how to build control mechanisms that prevent male ideologies from perpetuating insidious effects throughout the system, rather than just scream about how men should be barred from the position.<p>And step one to figuring out how to build said control mechanisms is explaining to people that they should help out. To which there is always the response that there isn&#x27;t anything wrong in the first place and look, women are underrepresented because they aren&#x27;t supposed to be in positions of power anyways so why change anything?<p>These conversations are necessarily circular because you can&#x27;t talk with everyone about everything all the time. You&#x27;re <i>always</i> going to rehash conversations periodically, and one-to-one representation is a fairly concrete fact-based grounding point for such conversations. You&#x27;re going to have to explain the benefits of functional programming to every fresh-faced only-learned-Java college graduate over and over again until you change the underlying system to explain functional programming to them before you have to.<p>> Third, there is the question of whether or not these inequalities are systemic because of male oppression or female behavior. It is likely a mix of the two, but feminists completely discount the latter.<p>Surely not EVERY feminist! That statement is provably false and anyone caught saying it should be instantly discredited.<p>> There are innumerable other issues I could list but what&#x27;s common to all of them, in my view, is that they focus so intently on the end goal of elevating women&#x27;s power status that they bulldoze over all other considerations indiscriminately.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s true. This is why I, for instance, have stopped arguing with atheists or privacy advocates. They&#x27;re so focused on the end goal that they bulldoze over all other considerations indiscriminately. That&#x27;s one of those costs you pay for people being human and actually caring about the issues they fight for.<p>Another cost is that, here in reality, if you don&#x27;t take a polarizing stance, it&#x27;s incredibly hard to provide compromises when it comes down to actually deciding policy. And if you take a polarizing stance long enough, you start fully committing to it rather than holding it for the sake of making change. If you take a realistic stance, then when you compromise, you start losing the things that are <i>necessary</i>, too. Both strategies are bad. You have to get insanely lucky for everything to work out well and crystallize over the course of generations.<p>There is no right answer. Thinking you have the right answer virtually guarantees that you&#x27;re bulldozing over someone else&#x27;s considerations. Failing to think you have the right answer pretty much means no one will listen to you. Fucked either way, so you fuck it up until it&#x27;s less bad.",1390346410

I might decide to build a factory, because I expect positive profits given the future prices of inputs and outputs.  But I can only know this if I have myself modeled the entire economy.

It may also help you understand the sort of things the Christian right fears from the likes of people like yourself.<p>Secondly, it&#x27;s not targeted towards children. Even assuming a child would be paying attention after the first ten minutes&#x27; read: there&#x27;s a sadistic lesbian police chief (a character of the sort whom Lewis is theorized to personally fancy), several open (if brief) discussions about sexuality and eroticism... to say nothing of the violent murders, suicides and tiger maulings.<p>It&#x27;s not exactly what you&#x27;d consider child-safe, let alone targeted.<p>But I guess if you already know all there is to know about Lewis from the five-minute treatment in your local left-leaning literature class, or if you gleaned most of it secondhand from reading Neil Gaiman&#x27;s <i>The Problem of Susan</i>, then you have no need to see anything that might interfere with your expectations.

Let me add a couple more.<p>Always think of your language as a compiled language even if you start out just writing an interpreter.  Otherwise you are likely to add features that are very difficult to compile efficiently.<p>If you&#x27;re trying to design a language for accessibility -- ease of use by relatively inexperienced programmers -- be aware of the tradeoffs.  For example, weak typing, such as automatic conversions between strings and integers, is commonly thought to make life easier for novices, but it can make it much harder to build large reliable systems -- and if your language is successful, it <i>will</i> wind up being used for large systems, regardless of its suitability for that purpose.  Conversions from strings and integers to booleans have been a particular problem area.  Make sure that comparison operators are transitive and equality is an equivalence relation -- and if you don&#x27;t know what those terms mean, you need to study programming language design before you attempt it yourself.",1390345541

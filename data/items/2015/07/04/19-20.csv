I&#x27;ve clocked almost 400 hours and I still really didn&#x27;t get into making planes - I&#x27;m launching rockets, building space stations and (with help of a bunch of cool mods) setting up colonies on moons.<p>This game has it all - you need to learn being precise (targeted landings if you want to build a structure somewhere or picked up kerbonauts you crashed the previous time), you need to plan and do logistics (hello fuel shipments), and you need patience (rendezvous and docking). And, as OP said, you quickly end up learning <i>a lot</i> about orbital mechanics, rocketry and space exploration. You don&#x27;t need to know the maths, but you&#x27;ll end up learning it anyway, because formulas are the easiest way to compress your intuition about &quot;why bigger ships need helluva bigger rockets&quot; or &quot;why when I go faster I go slower&quot;.<p>Oh, and a fun thing I observed watching the community - because KSP runs on Unity 4, which has an unusable 64bit version for Windows, and the game itself starts quickly eating your RAM when you go for installing part or visual mods to the point of crashing the 32bit version, a lot of people install Linux for the first time in their lives just to play a working 64bit version of KSP.

Good community management is all about managing expectations and cultivating your userbase so that they&#x27;ll support you during rough patches. Likewise, good public relations is all about controlling and influencing the narrative. Reddit-the-company, has apparently failed on both fronts. First, they shut out their core of dedicated, <i>free</i> volunteers, giving them literally no reason to be loyal to the company. As a direct result, reddit lost out on one of their best tools for managing the narrative. So when Reddit co. undermined their most prominent, productive volunteers by firing their staff liaison with no warning, it&#x27;s no damned wonder that the moderators turned on their &quot;bosses&quot;. Result? Instant PR nightmare, with next to zero available leverage for controlling it.<p>The whole thing is a failure of management, pure and simple. Reddit&#x27;s board should be looking for blood.",1436039862

9831404,comment,9830006,9830006,0,0,csa,,,"A good answer depends a lot on your personal and professional goals. Some possibilities:<p>- Do a startup.<p>- Work in industry.<p>- Become an academic in CS.<p>- Become a more well-rounded person.<p>While there can be some classes that meet more than one of these goals, I strongly suggest that you figure out your goal and work from there.<p>Some possible classes:<p>- Business courses. Economics, finance, and business/contract law are often good ones. Some marketing courses can be good as well -- it really depends on the school. I personally enjoyed a class about risk management (e.g., insurance).<p>- Anything that develops soft skills like writing or speaking. When picking a subject, I suggest trying to avoid some of the &quot;warm and fuzzy&quot; classes -- you will rarely get quality feedback, and &quot;success&quot; is defined as how well you toe the party line. Someone else suggested creative writing, and I suggest that this can be a hit or miss depending on your classmates and your instructor. Look for classes that will provide you with fundamental structure and constructive feedback (e.g., what you did well, what they have questions about, what needs work).<p>- Related to the above, make sure you know how to use Excel and PowerPoint well. Excel can be a really powerful tool for non-programmers, and it can serve as a functional gateway of trust between a programmer and non-technical people. For PowerPoint, try to learn how to make clean presentations (not a lot of text, don&#x27;t read what is on the slide, not a lot of gimmicks) and how to present them well.<p>- Fine arts. These classes absolutely blew my mind, and they really changed the way I perceived the world. Make sure you choose a good professor -- the good ones are really good, but the bad ones can be really bad. Don&#x27;t be intimidated if you find people who have been doing the art you take for years.<p>- Art history might serve as a light version of &quot;fine arts&quot;, but make sure you take it seriously. It is often an easy class taken by lazy students, so the standard to get an A might not be very high. That said, there is a great deal amazing content above and beyond the basics of memorizing certain eras and certain artworks.<p>- Consider joining an improv group, even if you think you will be bad at it. The skills you learn are invaluable: team work, public speaking, coping with failure, appreciating success, etc.<p>- History, especially economic history. History really does repeat itself, and this is especially true in economics. Classes like this make it easier to reflect on what is going on today.<p>- I personally enjoy anything related to cognitive development.<p>- Lastly, I suggest reading Undergraduation from &#x27;pg (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/college.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/college.html</a>). An excerpt:<p>&quot;The social sciences are also fairly bogus, because they&#x27;re so much influenced by intellectual fashions. If a physicist met a colleague from 100 years ago, he could teach him some new things; if a psychologist met a colleague from 100 years ago, they&#x27;d just get into an ideological argument. Yes, of course, you&#x27;ll learn something by taking a psychology class. The point is, you&#x27;ll learn more by taking a class in another department.<p>&quot;The worthwhile departments, in my opinion, are math, the hard sciences, engineering, history (especially economic and social history, and the history of science), architecture, and the classics. A survey course in art history may be worthwhile. Modern literature is important, but the way to learn about it is just to read. I don&#x27;t know enough about music to say.<p>&quot;You can skip the social sciences, philosophy, and the various departments created recently in response to political pressures. Many of these fields talk about important problems, certainly. But the way they talk about them is useless. For example, philosophy talks, among other things, about our obligations to one another; but you can learn more about this from a wise grandmother or E. B. White than from an academic philosopher.&quot;<p>Best of luck!",1436039840

You do have to remember the sharps and flats because you have to know in which key you are playing to see where is the music going. And when you&#x27;re playing you end up not needing the flats in each note because they&#x27;re always there.

9831337,comment,9830232,9830232,0,0,jveld,,,"Here are some shortcomings I thought of immediately.<p>- Traditional notation is instrument-agnostic.<p>- It may be easily printable, but a staff is easily <i>writable</i>. With just a pen and a ruler, I can produce a neat staff in ~10 seconds. The ruler is optional if I don&#x27;t\ncare about prettiness. With this, you more or less have to print it: getting the spacing right by hand would be quite difficult.<p>- I have mixed feelings about the the traditional representation of key. Missing a sharp or flat in an unfamiliar key is probably my most common error when\nreading sheet music. OTOH, The traditional notation <i>tells</i> me which sharps and flats to use. With this system, I have to already know the structure of C# major if I want to noodle around (always). This would seem to be more hostile to beginners.<p>- The precision issue has already been brought up many times, but I would add that all the lost information is an archival disaster. It might seem superfluous since\nwe have recordings, but given the rate of change in technology, access to data in old formats is by no means a certainty. Since this notation basically requires you to have heard the song in order to play it, it would become incomprehensible pretty quickly.<p>It seems to me that most of the complexity of musical notation reflects the &quot;essential&quot; complexity of actually playing the music. For example, consider key: even at the level of simple rock songs, a basic grasp of &quot;key&quot; is absolutely essential, and if you&#x27;re playing a piano, this means you have to know which sharps and flats to use. If this seems pedantic, consider that the main difficulty of learning to play a piece is dexterity. It&#x27;s going to take a bit of effort just to make your fingers hit the damn keys. Since this effort has to take place anyway, the little bit of extra effort to learn notation doesn&#x27;t seem like much to ask. Besides, the amount of notation required to play pop songs is relatively small - that rendition of &quot;Let it Be&quot; contains about 10 symbols, most of which are related.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that traditional notation is perfect, or even good. It is rather baroque, and I&#x27;m open to a &quot;redesign,&quot; as long as it really solves the problem. This redesign isn&#x27;t useless, but its scope of usefulness seems so limited that I&#x27;m not really sure it&#x27;s worth it.",1436038585

Making the black keys the same size as the white keys, a 8th would become a 13th. I don&#x27;t have small hands and I can barely reach a 11th interval. Basically, a lot of simultaneous notes could no longer be played. A solution would be to make the keys smaller, but then you wouldn&#x27;t be able to play semitones because your fingers wouldn&#x27;t fit comfortably.

You could lower the speed limit between towns, raise it the towns or build out the road in the city more and keep the limit higher like happens on the 101 when you go through some towns in the central valley.

Either by touching them or by looking at them, you can always know where you are. Not so easy with all the keys being the same.\n- The size of the keyboard is more or less adapted to our hand size. The distance between whole tones is similar to the distance between our fingers. A fifth is as wide as my hand, and I can play an octave without much effort. Making all the notes the same shape would change that and those common intervals would be more difficult to play.\n- Our hand is not flat. The fact that some notes are higher than others makes playing more comfortable.\n- Range. Same-shaped notes would occupy more space (unless you make them smaller than white notes, which would be uncomfortable) so either you get way bigger pianos (as if they were small) or pianos with less range.<p>There are probably more reasons why the black keys are there, these are just top off my head.",1436037049

AskScience is one of the best subreddits, largely because its moderation is so good. The fact that the AskScience mods stood up in agreement with what was going on, and pointed out how non-responsive admins had been, made me believe this is much more than a &quot;power play&quot;.",1436036648

I played in school concert bands for four years and could never manage to sight-read anything very complicated. Practicing was a chore and when we got new music I always had to sit and pick through it very slowly measure-by-measure until I figured out how it was supposed to sound. Once I knew that, I could &quot;read&quot; the music but I could never play a new piece on first sight. I knew all the notation but I could not look at a new piece of music and &quot;hear&quot; it in my head.. It felt more like trying to read a book letter by letter. I never was able to really see &quot;words&quot; and &quot;sentences&quot;. By the time I quit I really just hated everything about it.<p>I also had tremendous difficulty learning basic addition, subtraction, and multiplication facts compared to most of my friends. And I don&#x27;t play video games.<p>I do enjoy listening to music quite a bit, but I think I am a person who doesn&#x27;t have an ability to play it.",1436036599

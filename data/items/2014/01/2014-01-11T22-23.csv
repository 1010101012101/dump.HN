7044157,comment,7042525,7042525,2,0,thrownaway2424,,,"Interesting, and the author clearly is an expert on the topic.  However, I&#x27;m curious about how this fits in to a sensible program architecture.  When do you need such a queue?  It seems to me quite unlikely that production and consumption operate at the exact same rate and with the same CPU usage rate such that the queue runs in a steady state of neither full nor empty.  It seems much more likely that the queue will just be either full or empty all the time, in which case this algorithm will be terrible because it busy-waits instead of having condition variables that can be used to wake the consumers or block the producers.  By the way blocking the producers is also known as flow control, which many people believe is a desirable property of software.<p>If your queue is normally empty, it would be fine for the producing threads to just jump straight into the consuming routine and nevermind the queue.  If the queue is normally full, it&#x27;s fine for them to just take a lock and sleep on a condition.<p>Normally what you want a p/c queue for is to paper over short term variance in a system where on long time scales the consumer side is faster than the producer side.  In that role, an ordinary queue with a mutex will work fine.  If the consumer is stalled for long enough to fill the queue, blocking the producer is exactly what you want.<p>Of course, some languages favor the use of this pattern.  I&#x27;m thinking of Go channels.  Totally lock-free Go channels would be pretty awesome, but busy-waiting in select would not be awesome.",1389481145

Between thoughtful parents and school systems who choose not to participate through to the realities of poverty and the wealth gap something like this will never occur.

7044131,comment,7043567,7043567,11,0,ANTSANTS,,,"I had a bad experience with my high school computer science classes (both the AP Java curriculum and a teacher-designed curriculum). No one learned anything in that class: You either already had some experience with programming and were thus far beyond the scope of the curriculum, or didn&#x27;t know anything and were introduced to difficult new ideas by a horribly designed curriculum and ineffectual teacher. `What does &quot;public static void main (String []args)&quot;[1] mean? Why do I have to write all that?` `It&#x27;s what you put at the start.` `This is stupid, I&#x27;m going to play Quake and copy someone&#x27;s work later.`<p>It was a pointless and discouraging experience all around. The only people who came out of those classes and actually did anything related to technology were already learning on their own in the first place. A neutral effect at best, more likely negative.<p>I&#x27;d explain further, but instead of complaining more about my specific experience, I&#x27;ll just get to the point: the problem is not that the high school compsci curricula are somehow biased against people that aren&#x27;t white and male, it&#x27;s that the curricula are totally fucking useless and aren&#x27;t teaching anyone anything. The only way to do &quot;well&quot; in them is to have preexisting programming knowledge, which just happens to mostly exist in middle class boys privileged enough to own a personal computer.[2] The whiteness and maleness of the kids in these classes is not the problem, it is a <i>symptom</i> of a greater problem.<p>I think to fix the gap, you have to introduce some level of computer science education in elementary school. If you just leave it to kids to discover the magic of computers on their own, it shouldn&#x27;t be surprising that most kids won&#x27;t, and the ones with opportunities to use computers at home get a huge head start.<p>The other thing: We need people in &quot;tech&quot; to be selfless and sacrifice their cushy salaries to contribute to education. My teacher barely knew how to program, and couldn&#x27;t teach worth a damn either. One memorable moment that stunted my growth as a programmer for a while: She actually, I shit you not, told us that all the programming jobs were being offshored to India and that we shouldn&#x27;t bother. We believed her. If <i>that</i> is the kind of teacher that we have introducing kids to computer science, there is clearly a problem, because just about <i>any</i> CS undergrad could have done a better job. Given enough freedom (that is sadly nowhere to be found in our bureaucratic education system), they could easily design a curriculum that goes far further than the AP curriculum while being more approachable and more exciting. Here&#x27;s a start: Ditch Java for Python, Lua, or even (barf) Javascript. Here&#x27;s another idea that can start as early as elementary school: Give kids ~50 megabytes on a web server and teach them to make their own personal static web pages by hand in HTML, Geocities-style. And another: either ditch Windows XP, or configure the systems so that they aren&#x27;t completely locked down and impossible to do <i>anything</i> on.<p>I think you see my point here: These are ideas that should be totally obvious to anyone who cares about education and has basic programming experience, that could make a big difference with very little effort, yet no one is doing anything like them at all. This suggests that there are systemic problems that will not be easy to correct: the early education system is hopelessly bureaucratic, the tech industry has no voice in it, that smart programmers aren&#x27;t altruistic enough to give up relatively large salaries to work for education...<p>If I seem bitter about this, it&#x27;s because I am. My education system (and I suspect many others) only focused on improving the racial divide, barely making any effort to improve curricula, hire better teachers, or think outside of the box in any way, to the detriment of <i>everyone.</i><p>[1] I don&#x27;t speak Java, did I get that right?<p>[2] It&#x27;s not just about middle class privilege, though: When I was in school, I think it was actually more common for girls to have personal laptops than boys, probably because parents believe that &quot;if you give a boy a computer, he&#x27;ll just look at porn all day.&quot; Yet still there were very few girls truly interested in computers or taking the computer science classes.",1389480816

It&#x27;s much cheaper and safer to compare &quot;abs(x-y) < 1e-10*y&quot;.<p>Also, you almost always want to compare (x-y) to an absolute convergence limit (in addition to your relative tolerance), in case x and y are very near zero.<p>Finally, if you really want a generic converge function that can be re-used elsewhere, you might want to allow for non-convergent processes.  This requires tracking the number of iterations, and bailing when it gets too large.<p>By the way, now that your convergence function wants to know (x-y) rather than x and y individually, you might consider rewriting your logic functions to return the predicted change, rather than the final state.

7044065,comment,7043644,7043964,8,0,tikhonj,,,"This is where functional reactive programming really shines. It lets you model time explicitly. You can easily work with streams of events, but you can also work with things that change <i>continuously</i> over time.<p>With a standard callback/state-based approach, you end up <i>implicitly</i> modelling time through mutable state. This has a few major disadvantages: it&#x27;s difficult to talk about history and time is distinctly second-class. The &quot;resolution&quot; over time is also implicit and ends up depending on your implementation.<p>An FRP approach lets you make time explicit and a <i>first-class citizen</i>. In turn, this allows you to directly talk about the relationships between time-varying values and their histories--for example, you can &quot;integrate&quot; over time explicitly.<p>My favorite example comes from a little game of life applet[1] I wrote. Basically, I have an explicit timer that controls animation steps (called life)--it&#x27;s a stream of () which has a value every <i>n</i> milliseconds. I also have a behavior called &quot;paused&quot; which corresponds to whether the pause button is pressed. I can combine these directly:<p><pre><code>    when (not <$> paused) (step <$ life)\n</code></pre>\n(The step :: Life -> Life function represents iterating a single generation.)<p>I also have a stream of (x, y) coordinates from the mouse. There&#x27;s a modify :: (Int, Int) -> Life -> Life function that flips a cell at the given point. I can combine these into <i>another</i> Life -> Life stream thanks to partial application:<p><pre><code>    modify <$> clicks\n</code></pre>\nNow that I have these two streams, I can just combine them with union:<p><pre><code>    when (not <$> paused) (step <$ life) `union` (modify <$> clicks)\n</code></pre>\nThe cool thing about this short snippet is that it shows how I can combine three inputs--a button, a timer and the mouse--into a single stream very easily. It&#x27;s also very flexible. Right now, the &quot;when&quot; only applies to the first input: you can modify using the mouse even when you&#x27;re paused. If I wanted to change this, I could just wrap the whole thing in the when:<p><pre><code>    when (not <$> paused) (step <$ life `union` (modify <$> clicks))\n</code></pre>\nAnyhow, I think FRP is an awesome approach for this sort of problem. Another thing that I did not mention is that you can write your program in a way that&#x27;s &quot;resolution-independent&quot; over time. If your library models time continuously, you get the moral equivalent of an SVG except for reactive code! I think that&#x27;s pretty cool too, although it turns out to be tricky to implement.<p>[1]: <a href""http://jelv.is/fr"" rel""nofollo"">http://jelv.is/frp</a>",1389479873

It assumes a mission statement to the user (I&#x27;ll make one up and say it&#x27;s &quot;I will organize your computer&#x27;s resources and let you use them easily&quot;) and code contracts that allow multiple components to serve this goal.  Internally, the components are abstracted into statements of a very simple logic-flow.<p>This paradigm persists in many components themselves, from the bootloader to the end-user.  When I want to update something in user space, it involves, from my perspective, no interaction with the operating system (even though it is really the one doing everything).  Conversely if I want to do something as advanced as completely rewrite my filesystem implementation (something my operating system is very dependent on), I can, and without ever needing to touch my operating system&#x27;s source.  I could come up with any ridiculous way for a filesystem to work, and my operating system would be cool with it, and would operate the same way because if its modularized and abstracted design.<p>I would say these are incredibly good design features and that you would have to be extremely hard pressed to find a system that inherently cannot be designed in such a way as to mitigate maintainability and trivialize extensibility.

A local network asked him to explain a meteor shower. Initially, Tyson felt shy and uncomfortable with the publicity.<p>After he did the interview, he became more observant of the media and noticed something strange: he didn&#x27;t see any other black men featured in segments that didn&#x27;t have to do with being black. Sure, there were well-intentioned pieces highlighting the struggles of black Americans, but there weren&#x27;t <i>any</i> other segments in which an expert, who happened to be black, discussed science.<p>That realization is part of what inspired Tyson to pursue physics and speak to audiences about science. I think his story speaks volumes about the tone with which we, members of the &quot;tech community,&quot; discuss the race and gender gap.<p>Tyson&#x27;s message was simple: show, don&#x27;t tell. In other words, don&#x27;t just examine why certain groups are underrepresented and dwell on the inequality. Instead, counterbalance these types of stories with stories that <i>show</i> how members of the underrepresented groups are making progress.<p>During the past few days I&#x27;ve seen dozens of articles about the disadvantages that women in tech face. But I haven&#x27;t seen a proportionate number of stories about the women who are succeeding in the industry.<p>Tyson said that, for many American TV viewers, seeing one &quot;smart black man&quot; discuss science was enough to overturn deeply ingrained stereotypes. Stories about female founders succeeding are equally powerful, and we should highlight them in addition to focusing on the inequalities.",1389478925

When discussing the functional approach to the simulation, the author still talks about objects, such as tanks and shells, whose state gets tracked.

7043943,comment,7043644,7043644,31,0,crntaylor,,,"&quot;Turning your code inside out&quot; is a great piece of advice, as it often opens up abstractions and refactorings that you didn&#x27;t realize where there to begin with. The same idea is behind several common object-oriented design patterns (Command, Mediator, Strategy, Visitor) but it&#x27;s baked into to many functional programming languages.<p>For example, say we want to write a function to compute square roots. A common approach to computing sqrt(n) is to start with a guess of x = 1.0, and keep replacing x with (0.5 * (x + n/x) until the relative difference between subsequent guesses is small enough.<p><pre><code>  sqrt n = loop x0 x1\n   where\n    loop x y = if converged x y\n      then y\n      else loop y (0.5 * (y + n/y))\n    converged x y = abs (x/y - 1) < 1e-10\n    x0 = 1.0;\n    x1 = 0.5 * (1.0 + 1.0/n)\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s good, but it has the test for convergence all mixed up with the logic for generating the guesses. What if we could factor out the code that generates an infinite sequence of guesses?<p><pre><code>  sqrtGuesses n = go 1.0\n   where\n    go x = x : go (0.5 * (x + n/x))\n</code></pre>\nNote that this works in Haskell because of laziness, but it&#x27;s simple in any language that has a mechanism for delaying computations. Now we&#x27;ve decoupled the method for generating a sequence of guesses, we can write a function that checks for relative convergence<p><pre><code>   converge (x:y:rest) = if abs (x/y - 1) < 1e-10\n     then y\n     else converge (y:rest)\n</code></pre>\nand define the square root function in terms of these<p><pre><code>   sqrt n = converge (sqrtGuesses n)\n</code></pre>\nThe logic of the program is now much cleaner, and we&#x27;ve got a useful function &#x27;converge&#x27; which can be re-used in other parts of the program.<p>This kind of &#x27;turning inside out&#x27; is often possible in functional languages, often leads to more compact and more compositional code, and is one of the reasons that I enjoy programming functionally so much.",1389477628

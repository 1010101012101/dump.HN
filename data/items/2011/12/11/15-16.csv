3340245,comment,3340143,3340143,8,0,bethling,,,"I think it makes sense to encourage women to consider doing a start up - yes for some women raising a family is the fulfillment that they want.   But for those that do want to focus on a career, it's very possible to feel left out.   Although (intellectually) you know that there's no reason why if this guy or that guy can do it, you can't - there's something somewhat sobering and potentially disheartening about almost everyone being ""different"" than you.   As the years start adding, up its the same thing with age - I /know/ that I can do it, but there's that seed of doubt for one reason or another.<p>So I think it's a good thing to encourage anyone who doesn't meet the standard expected start up founder profile - whether it's women, or people who have been around the block a couple of times.   They (we :)), might have good ideas, we might need to be reminded that can be done - and to be pointed in the right direction.",1323619155

The state tax has no treaty cover, so if your income comes from another country, you're likely to be double taxed on that.<p>Also, if you're making under $500K a year, you likely fall under the AMT, which means those attorney fees, tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars of them, are not expensible (and neither is almost anything else).<p>I really don't see a reason why someone who already has wealth would pay $100K, let alone $1M, to gain US residency.

3340228,comment,3340143,3340143,2,0,hnecib,,,"I think she made some very good points. It was a bit ranty, and self contradictory at times:<p>>On top of that there is evidence that the members of the VC community go out of their way to attract women. Of course, this makes sense. VCs look for underserved markets. Women are likely to address different markets than men, and since there are so few women founders compared to men founders, its likely that women are addressing an underserved market.<p>and then this:<p>>Whoever started the TED Womens conference is pathetic.<p>Uh, ok. Right on TED Women's webpage they say that ""Over the past several years, a flood of fascinating data from the worlds of education, microfinance and more has shown an essential link between investing in women and girls and economic growth, public health, political stability.""<p>And it goes on to state that TEDW wants to explore those 'underserved markets' to borrow the author's words, in greater detail, -behavior that she just got finished praising.<p>But whatever, I'm nitpicking. I think the general thrust of most of her arguments have merit. Women often choose to disengage from the business world to realize life goals that make them happier than what business success can offer them. What guy hasn't had this dream? To be sure, it's probably a different dream. For women, it may involve having children and raising a family for some. For me, it might be throwing caution to the wind and traveling the world. Bottom line is that I think there are some very basic 'non-business' aspirational lifestyles that humans of all walks of life wish they could engage in at different times. Biology and culture have conspired to offer women one of them up on a silver platter if they so choose. Many do, and there's nothing wrong with that.<p>EDIT: I don't know how scientific this is, but just an ironic post I came across browsing just now.

Ultimate Bet, the online poker site that was shut down by authorities on Black Friday this year, apparently leaked a long list of players personal information, revealing millions of names, addresses, account numbers, and seemingly encrypted passwords. Among those millions of players were hundreds of thousands of Canadians  319,000, to be exact.<p>While its highly unlikely that Ultimate Bet could have been behind the leak, as the company responsible for protecting these personal details, they are ultimately responsible for what happens to these sensitive files. A number of scenarios are possible  a disgruntled employee could have stolen the list of player details and intentionally leaked it to the public in order to create further scandal, or perhaps a hacker decided to target the trouble online poker site. Whether the information was intended to be made so public is also unknown  perhaps it was illicitly procured with the intent to sell it, only it was leaked before a sale could take place. Its really anyones guess what may have been going on behind the scenes, but the fact remains that millions of players information was released without their consent.<p>Now that Ultimate Bet has been shut down, its uncertain how anyone can be prosecuted for this lapse in privacy protection. For any players who fear their information may have been revealed, the only thing left to do is hope that no one who saw it will use it malevolently.",1323617454

I have recently realized that a 4-core smarthpone, one of those coming in mid-2012, on a 1.5 GHz (e.g. the rumored HTC Edge) theoretically packs similar power to that of my dual-core Macbook Pro 2.8 GHz (4x1.5=6 vs. 2.8x2=5.6). One probably cannot compare OMAP with x86 too much, but still, the CPU developments in mobile space excite me more than the desktop ones, which frankly, disappoint me a bit. Somehow, sometime in 2000s I expected to have massively parallel CPU sometime around now, not a mere 6-core.",1323616051

You're not going to ruin everything by arguing that there is not such thing as value (other than market value) and that without market value we are in no position to say whether a cure for cancer is more valuable than the Holocaust, are you?<p>""But the premise of capitalism is that the best way to determine something's value is how much others are willing to pay for it.""<p>And why would anyone accept that premise? It's absurd. I see people paying tons of money for things that have little value. If value were definitionally equal to market price or revenue, then it would be meaningless to say that someone wasted their money on something. In this worldview (which I would call ""market fundamentalism""), if Patsy paid $10000 for a rubber chicken, then the rubber chicken is by definition worth $10000. Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of how markets work knows that they are prone to groupthink, panic, irrational exuberance and other anomalies.<p>Another example: if you accept this ""no value but market value"" nonsense, you have to conclude that giving medicine to sick people in Africa has no value, since these people are not paying for the medicine (they have no money).<p>Value is ultimately a moral category. The goal of the economic system is to make sure valuable contributions are rewarded with appropriate economic value. At least it's one of the possible goals.<p>""In the absence of any restriction, these creators haven't created anything of value because it's easily reproducible.""<p>It may be easily reproducible, but for someone to reproduce it, it must be created in the first place. The creating is the hard part, not copying bits.<p>""If you place the arbitrary restriction of 'copyright' on these works, then, yes, they become valuable through artificial scarcity. But that's true of anything that has very little value.""<p>Yes, I see your point. You can inflate the economic value of anything through regulations. That doesn't mean, however, that all such regulations are wrong. To say otherwise would be to say ""the market is always right"".<p>You are okay with making money on SaaS because it happens ""without arbitrary legal restriction"". But the reason why a SaaS company can maintain the secrecy of their source code is rooted in arbitrary legal restrictions. One such restriction is that I cannot break into the 37signals HQ and copy their codebase. Why not? I don't see why I shouldn't be allowed to enter a particular building and have a look around, as long as I don't break anything (and even if I do, I can reimburse 37signals for broken locks, smashed windowpanes, etc.). So in a way, you can make money on SaaS because of an arbitrary legal restriction.<p>Just as we have laws that prohibit people from entering corporate buildings, we can have laws that prohibit copying of content unless authorized by the creator. Unless I'm making some kind of mistake in reasoning (I'm kind of sleepy right now), I'm not sure one of these is more arbitrary than the other.<p>""In this world, how do you decide how much to pay them? In other words, how do you determine the value of their contribution?""<p>The government sets the restrictions (e.g. the copyright term, fair use, penalties); the rest is determined by the market. The restrictions themselves are somewhat arbitrary, but any human-made formal system is somewhat arbitrary. For example, the government sets an arbitrary requirement that you should have your car checked every year. This creates a market for vehicle inspection services. The price for this service is determined by the market and depends on many things, including the supply of specialists. Similarly, environmental laws create artificial demand for recycling services, green technology, etc.<p>Why is this done? Because we believe road safety and a clean environment have more value than the free market assigns to them. It is a matter of public policy.",1323615967

A large part of the reason for the rise of surface mount electronic components (SMT parts are soldered to the same side of the circuit board that they are placed on) is that they make it much cheaper to assemble electronics by automated pick & place machines than it would have been to keep the older through-hole components (with pins/wires that go through the board and are soldered on the opposite side) and use human-like robots to assemble them.<p>Likewise, airplanes have autopilots designed into them for that purpose instead of having robotic pilots sitting in seats.<p>The reality is that in most large volume manufacturing, special purpose automation will win out over general purpose robots.",1323615955

3340169,comment,3339193,3339276,4,0,telemachos,,,"tl;dr - You reminded me of a favorite article on relativism and understanding other cultures (especially other cultures very far from us in time and circumstances). There's a quote from the piece below, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in this issue.<p>>> As some people say, we're already in a Singularity relative to ancient Grecians, inasmuch as they couldn't understand our world at all... and I think it's true in the opposite direction, too.<p>This reminded me immediately of a line of thought from Bernard Williams[1]. He's discussing relativism, and he argues that there is some truth to it (roughly: relativism, understood in a very specific way makes sense for ethics, but not for science). In order to make this argument, he considers what it would mean for two or more <i>systems of belief</i> to come into contact. (As a shorthand, he calls a <i>system of belief</i> an <i>S</i> throughout the paper.) He wants to make the claim that relativism is coherent in cases where <i>S</i>s can to some extent understand one another, but there is no <i>real</i> possibility of a person with <i>S</i>1 giving that up in favor of <i>S</i>2 (or vice-versa).<p>This is already very long, but my point is that I think it's not so much that ""they couldn't understand our world at all"" or that we can't understand theirs. It's rather that however well we understand it, we simply could not give up our <i>S</i> and take up theirs - not without massive false consciousness.<p>Here's the key quote you made me think of:<p>>> [M]any <i>S</i>s which have been held are not real options now. The life of a Greek Bronze Age chief, or a mediaeval Samurai, and the outlooks that go with those, are not real options for us: there is no way of living them. This is not to say that reflection on those value-systems may not provide inspiration for thoughts about elements missing from modern life, but there is no way of taking on those <i>S</i>s. Even Utopian projects among a small band of enthusiasts could not reproduce that life: still more, the project of re-enacting it on a societal scale in the context of actual modern industrial life would involve one of those social or political mistakes, in fact a vast illusion. The prospect of removing the conditions of modern industrial life altogether is something else again -- another, though different, impossibility.[2]<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Williams"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Williams</a><p>[2] ""The Truth in Relativsm"" <i>Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society</i>, New Series, Vol. 75, (1974 - 1975), pp. 215-228, on page 224.

We're not hackers, we believe in technical correctness, test-driven development and choosing the best tool for the problem at hand. This means that we generally write mobile software in the target platform language, server software in JVM languages, and on the occasions where we get to work on hardware and OS development, C and assembly.<p>The work approach is not laden with technical culture and ""fun"", unless you find solid engineering to be fun (personally, I do).<p>However, we've had great success in hiring genuinely senior engineers with at least a decade of experience each. We experimented early on with hiring junior engineers, but found that the overhead of dealing with untrained engineers was exceptionally high -- something that models my experience elsewhere, at larger companies.<p>With the caveat that these are generalizations, I've found that the cost to hiring junior engineers is expressed in obvious and (perhaps) non-obvious ways. There are the obvious costs of the training and mentoring required, along-side lower productivity, and a lesser ability to estimate complexity and time to completion. There are also more abstract costs, such as technical and design debt that junior engineers are much more likely to incur simply due to a lack of experience. There are also cultural costs -- if you hire too many junior engineers, you'll create a technical culture and working experience that drives senior candidates away, amplifying the costs I've listed above.<p>Of course, I readily admit that <i>someone</i> must hire untrained junior engineers, and I realize the implicit unfairness of hiring standards that would exclude myself were it 15 years ago. However, there are companies other than our own that are willing to bear these costs in exchange for being able to recruit at the scale they require -- we're just not one of them, and I think our reasoning is sound.<p>That said, there are some things a junior engineer can do to make themselves less junior, (possibly before even entering the labor market):<p>- Get experience (class projects don't count). A great way to do this is by contributing to OSS, especially projects that demand high-technical competence (eg, contribute to the ruby interpreter or MacRuby, not just high-level Ruby on Rails). Senior engineers have past experience to draw on when implementing software projects; this allows them to design not just for the immediate requirements, but with an understanding of how the requirements, maintenance costs, and performance will evolve over time.<p>- Study practical implementation topics (... and then get experience implementing them). A lot of the value of a senior engineer is in their broad understanding of the practical topics of the field. Coming out of a CS program, you should hopefully have a firm grasp of the fundamentals of CS, but what many candidates are missing is a firm understanding of applied programming. Some off the cuff general book suggestions: UNIX Network Programming, Application Programming in a UNIX Environment, Mac OS X Internals, Applied Cryptography, The Design and Implementation of The FreeBSD Operating System, Database in Depth. This list is probably incomplete :)<p>- Don't settle for <i>just</i> an internship. Internships at big companies (Apple, Google, Microsoft) serve as a relatively cheap first-pass filter on college candidates for hiring. Of a given pool of software interns at a company like Apple, it's unlikely that more than a 10% of them will be hirable material, and of those 10, maybe 2-3 will actually get jobs. Other companies may hire a larger percentage (I don't have any experience there). If you want to work for Apple, Microsoft, or Google (or think you might), then don't sit on your laurels if you get an internship there. Pick a real, practical problem that, and work on it, hard, leveraging your access to senior engineers for advice and guidance as much as possible. If you just coast through the internship, you probably won't receive an offer. I think some students look at internships at the big companies as prestigious. However, they <i>may</i> be viewed as the opposite -- an internship at one (or more) of those companies without being hired is a red flag for me, since I'm wondering why you didn't get an offer.",1323615600

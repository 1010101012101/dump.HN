This limit is for an object &quot;held together by gravity alone&quot;! The moon is not held together by gravity alone - the dust on the surface is, but the rocks in the center are all fused together.<p>Additionally since they assume the moon will continue to have a synchronized orbit (the same side always faces us) it won&#x27;t feel the tides in the same way. It would feel some constant stretching, but not the severe flexing caused by rotation.<p>The closer side would fall &quot;down&quot; and the far side would fall &quot;up&quot;. Only the center would be in free fall. I suspect the moon could survive that - but I&#x27;m not sure.<p>If not, it would spread out into rings.<p>There&#x27;s other errors too: In a situation like this the Earth would also synchronize it&#x27;s orbit. A day would speed up and the moon pushed higher until the two matched. This would stop the flood, burn scenario in the article.",1400522392

Whether or not you agree with him, that&#x27;s certainly an internally consistent view of things.<p>On the other hand, what we&#x27;re talking about here is explicitly choosing to request content from a webpage and then complaining that the ads are an intrusion.  There&#x27;s no analogue to &quot;walking through a public space&quot;: no fundamental right to view content that other people made on exactly the terms that you deem acceptable.  As poor a comparison as it may be, the comparison to shoplifting is FAR more accurate than the comparison to what Banksy is describing.",1400522119

At least if the moon did not fall down on earth as it probbaly would if going this low. This would cause the moon to stay in a fixed spot in the sky. Since the area under the moon would be in shadow from it most or all of the time, this would be an extra region with polar climate, that could bind up large portion of the earths water as ice, making the earth a lot dryer elsewhere.

7768662,comment,7765332,7766968,3,0,lvevjo,,,"Regarding vitamin D, I would add that the only way to make sure your vitamin D level is sufficient is to get tested. Relying on the DRI alone will leave some people insufficient. I expect that many Soylent users will be insufficient and maybe deficient in vitamin D, not because of any failing on Soylent&#x27;s part, but because this is already true for a random selection of the non-Soylent-using population. Dark-skinned individuals, obese individuals, and people with very little sun exposure (or living at a high latitude) are more likely to be deficient.<p>Practically speaking, this means: during your next annual physical, make sure your doctor tests your vitamin D along with your other bloodwork. The correct test is called 25(OH)D. Your insurance should cover it. (I am making an assumption about how privileged most HNers are.) Aim for a blood level of 30-40 ng/mL. <20 ng/mL is deficient, >=30 is sufficient, while >40 is probably pushing it, i.e. observational studies suggest that mortality starts to increase slightly around that point. A level greater than 50 ng/mL is almost certainly excessive, though still not close to toxicity. Some people argue for supplementing enough vitamin D to achieve higher blood levels (>40 ng/mL), but IMO the evidence doesn&#x27;t support doing this and it might be harmful.",1400521035

They even gave me the invoice with it - something north of $10,000 new [1]. Anyway, after I left to join the spinoff firm, I brought it into the office to run the plotter [HP DesignJet 750C]. We ran it as a sneakerNet server, even after we got a real network and file server with [QIC tape drive]. By the time I left a couple of years later, the keyboard had made it&#x27;s way back to the home office and I used it on the old 486 running bootlegged Advanced Server from my brother-in-law as a backup device - also had a QIC tape drive I picked up for about $12 - I was using a PII box as my primary machine, by then and a USB keyboard just because it was so finicky that the PS/2 keyboard would sometimes not work after a reboot [a really cheap and crappy machine that was]. So my model 80 went away when I donated the 486, and then many years later I learned what it was.<p>The 8571 was just a gorgeous hardware with a cast aluminium case and a carrying handle. The hard disk inside was about the size of a small cat and sounded like a washing machine when it was running.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cs.cuw.edu/museum/IBMPS280.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cuw.edu/museum/IBMPS280.html</a>",1400520786

So if I&#x27;m billing out at a rate that&#x27;s twice what I would make per hour at a full-time job (40 hours a week), I end up quite a bit behind.

Even then, it throws good practice out the window by defaulting to throwing all the application-specific classes in the global namespace (which makes Composer&#x27;s work harder, since it has to scan the entire app/ directory to build the class -> file map) and  failing to provide any way to pass context to your code other than through global state.<p>Don&#x27;t even get me started on the ubiquitous, ridiculously verbose, unhelpful, and intelligence-insulting comments.

Thus over the course of an hour you can retake the quiz enough times to brute force a perfect score without breaking the letter (and arguably the spirit) of the honor code.<p>Another interesting aspect of this ""online ethics"" is that there's no technical measures preventing you from pulling up past quiz results, and even if there was, you could still keep previous sessions open in a browser and even if there were countermeasures against that (javascript erasing), JS could be disabled, etc.<p>The Programming Projects that ML class had were slightly better metric of performance as there's more work that would have to be plagiarized, and if you're just going to go through life outsourcing all of your work then I guess that's your prerogative. However, I think that if you wanted to be very serious about actually testing for knowledge of material then the addition of some sort of interview component (phone/skype session), while time-consuming, could help.",1323914074

As equality improved, some of the brightest prospective teachers instead became doctors, scientists, and engineers. This decrease in teacher quality is resulting in a more ""assembly line"" style of education, where each step is fully structured.

3354681,comment,3353593,3354568,8,0,earbitscom,,,"I think the preference stems primarily from two factors:<p>1. There are hundreds of YC companies now, each with multiple founders, almost all of whom are HN readers.  Each person here votes on topics, articles and companies they find interesting.  I follow a lot of YC-related news because it's fun and helpful to be informed about YC and the alumni.  Therefore, I'm more familiar with YC companies and founders, so I will tend to vote on their news slightly more often.  With hundreds of founders from YC, it only takes a small bias like this to create a slight lean toward YC news getting better results here than other similar news.<p>2. This same bias isn't exclusive to YC alumni.  Most people on HN familiar with YC like it, respect PG, and are interested in YC companies and the progress of the portfolio.  So, in addition to a small bias on the part of the alumni, I have also seen that YC news gets more votes and comments from the rest of the community.<p>While that might mean that YC news gets more exposure and other news less, more people seem to be interested in it than not, so it seems the forum still works as it should.",1323914034

Let's forget that the Caucasus are in the middle of a religious war led by Arab religious sects attempting a religious coup in many parts of Russia. Let's forget that the Jews have been persecuted for thousands of years and Israel is surrounded by people trying to kill them simply because their Jews. Hey no shit, those ancestors of the jews who survived all their families being killed and robbed don't like that shit. Who knew!<p>You're complaining because Israel isn't being considerate to the poverty stricken Palestine that elected a terrorist organization as its leaders and that fire mortars into Israeli cities and use UN outposts so Israel can't return fire. Hey here's news to Palestine <i>not</i> spending money on things that destroy themselves could get you out of poverty.<p>Sorry I give Israel kudos because if any country was launching mortar strikes on US cities it would have been carpet bombed to rubble inside a week and with or without a religious or racial motives, no one would be complaining.",1323913845

Nobody I know has one and the one person I knew that wanted one more than anything else ended up buying and Android phone because he couldn't wait any more.

I've seen the interface, it looks slick, but that's where my knowledge of their platform stops.<p>In contrast, I see a new Android billboard (typically some flavor of Motorola's Droid) go up every month.

There has been a system of professors referring their top students to their colleagues for years, and on a small scale I don't see much issue. However, with these large online classes, these professors can stand to be gatekeepers to an incredibly massive - and valuable - source of leads. It doesn't help when there is no true transparency to the process, and a desire for the school to recoup costs - we assume the professor would just send the top 1000 over regardless of source, but what's to stop them from only referring the names of students who, say, enroll for credit and pay the university? Or those who pay some sort of a separate ""consideration fee""?
I can't put my finger on why, but I'm a little unnerved by this...",1323912751

And the issue that caused that is a level of fraud of massive proportions. The county has $4.1 billion dollars of debt.<p>Unfortunately services provided by private companies are not a right. You can call access to water a ""right"" and that's a reasonable claim. Now what does that actually mean. Do I have the right to demand free water from a private company riddled with debt? Do I have the right to demand free water from you personally? Or for you to pay my bill? Or for my bill to be reduced to zero? Or for someone to work at a utility company for free so that the utility company can provide a free service? Does that then mean that the utility company has a right to demand free parts from local supplies companies so that the can provide a free service?<p>Maybe the utility companies should be nationalized and all citizens can contribute tax dollars to the service. It wouldn't surprise me if that's how it's done in a lot of Eurozone countries? I'm not sure. I don't even really understand how the fraud occured and who is on the hook for the bill. It is however fair to say that it's way more complicated than ""how a country treat's it's least fortunate"".",1323911227

I thought this was the Windows Phone playbook - release as early as possible (2010), gain something like feature parity in fall 2011 (i.e. the Mango release) and team up with Nokia to make some great hardware (the Lumia).  This is what Windows Phone people have been telling me since the beginning of the year.  The virtues, logic and shortcomings of this have been evident from the beginning so I don't see how Ballmer can point at anyone but himself.<p>It's a problem that anyone stretching the definition of ""early adopter"" already had a phone that did everything a Windows Phone does in 2009.  Buying into a phone ecosystem sounds mundane to mildly entertaining to us, but it's a terrifying leap for most of the market - the vast majority of people will buy what their more technically inclined friends and family use.  Think of how long it's taken for the iPhone to approach the prevalence of the Blackberry - how bizarre, then, that MS expected WP to bloom while two competent competitors are taking the market by storm. WP7's biggest fault has nothing to do with Andy Lees - it's too late to market.",1323911200

The fact is, for every startup bought by the big five's (Google, MS, Yahoo, AOL, eBay) there are at least another 100 that go down the drain.",1172393955

994,comment,992,992,0,0,python_kiss,,,"In-game advertising is a severely underdeveloped business considering how long games have been around. Since this concept is new, branding within video games would work much better than it does on old-media (print/television). This has a huge potential especially in multiplayer games that require thoughtful analysis and interaction with the virtual medium (as opposed to passively watching the television). Both the market and the technology already exists; it is simply a matter of time before some startup (like adscape) takes a large piece of it.",1172393463

991,comment,990,990,0,0,python_kiss,,,"From the article: &#34;Most attempts at innovation fail to generate enough payback. Payback means one thing-cash&#34;. In an earlier post on news.ycomb I suggested that a business is not a business if it does not generate money. The authors of the book &#34;PayBack&#34; insist that any innovation is pointless unless it leads to profit. I know a lot of people on this site are startup (co)founders; so I would like to encourage everyone to take a little time to atleast ramp up a business plan other than one that involves Google's adsense :)",1172392886

The problems arise when strings are held responsible for the side effects of other functions which manipulate the data within strings.<p>In particular, problems arise when some function renders a sequence of characters contained in a string [fundamental string operations such as concatenation tend not to be problematic].  These problems are due to the transition from the mathematical certainty of strings to the heuristics of text rendering.

With void * you can do anything, with interface{} you can only use the dynamic types inside the interface.<p>That being said, using interface{} for unions is extremely unfortunate. The bright side is that after 4 years of using Go almost exclusively, I only had to abuse interface{} only once, with compiler parsers (like the parent says). Every other time there was a better design which did not require using interface{}.",1385644199

6814336,comment,6810543,6810543,3,0,zamalek,,,"The main problem with cryptocurrencies, as I see it <i>today</i>, is that there is no motivation to spend it. Inflation actually has a very important purpose - it keeps the currency liquid, if you hoard money you lose money. From the Average Joe&#x27;s inflation might seem like a bad thing but the truth is what worth is a currency is nobody is willing to exchange it? &quot;Money&quot; is a lay-mans term that isn&#x27;t really used by professionals within the economic industries; in nearly all cases it is referred to as &quot;liquid&quot;. Liquids are supposed to flow and it is a very important feature of currency.<p>The current hyperdeflation is encouraging people to hoard their bitcoins; which means that they are behaving a lot more like a commodity - and there-in lies the problem: they are deluding people. Not only do they have the word &quot;coin&quot; in their name but they also fall under the category of &quot;cryptocurrency&quot;.<p>The problem is that people are so firm in their belief that inflation is one way for a government to screw them; that they will change their argument (no, it&#x27;s a commodity vs. no, it&#x27;s a currency) depending on which argument you present to them.<p>What we need a cryptocurrency that penalizes hoarding; or at the very least in some way encourages spending (or exchanging).<p>Let&#x27;s say that hypothetically I don&#x27;t know what I am talking about; and that hypothetically bitcoin becomes a universal currency as many would have it (all other currencies are abolished). Now consider the hypothetical scenario where you are selling property and have a family to feed at home. You spend your day showing people properties and nobody buys - why? Because their currency will be worth a lot more tomorrow than the fixed asset you are offering. The economy will collapse.",1385643954

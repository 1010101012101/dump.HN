Adding types to the surface area (arguments and return types) removes a lot of friction.<p>I'm using jQuery for a couple of years. I still have to look at its docs almost every day I use it. Today, I had to check if the ""selector"" argument of ""children()"" is optional (spoiler: it is).<p>Also, having the type annotations there makes the intention so much clearer.

It's a grid of point masses with constraints between them (the lines you see) that says to keep the points at a constant distance from each other. Think of the constraints as springs that follow Hooks law[1], only infinitely stiff. You iterate through all the constraints and move the two points of each constraint apart if they are too close, or closer if they are too far apart. You need some basic linear algebra for the distance and direction calculations. It's common to use verlet integration to actually move the points because it's so easy do solve the constraints with it. Add some gravity and it looks very convincing.<p>To tear the ""cloth"", all you need to do is to remove those particular constraints from the list.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law</a>",1366685860

5593056,comment,5592403,5592786,2,0,riggins,,,"the netflix numbers are actually pretty easy. At $8/months, it's ~$96/year ... which is close enough to $100 to make for easy math.<p>Quick and dirty numbers (on just the domestic streaming).<p>At 30M subs, run rate revenue is approximately $3B. They had about $2B in content commitments. Delivery costs (i.e. bandwidth) runs about 20% of revenue. So on their $3B, $600M goes to delivery, $2B goes to content, and they have $400M-ish in profits.<p>NFLX is difficult to value because it's growing so fast and the content cost is a moving target. If NFLX can keep content costs around $2B, then every incremental customer is 80% profit. Every 1M subs they add, is $100M in revenue and $80M in profit (capitalize that at 10x and you're adding $800M in valuation ... keep in mind they added 2M domestic subs in the last 3 months). Some people argue that content providers will demand higher fees as NFLX increases subscribers. I'm not convinced. They walked away from Starz and they cut a deal with Disney that doesn't look any more expensive than what they were paying previously. And they're also building a library of owned content.<p>It's definitely one of the most interesting stories to watch.",1366685725

Duke Nukem Forever to be fair was in development for 14 years prior to Gearboxes involvement, they finished the game, they didn't develop it from the start they merely did what 3D Realms failed to do. Colonial Marines was definitely a crappy game, horrible even. The graphics quality not to mention the number of bugs, lack of Aliens continuity and horrible AI that it had make it one of the worse games Gearbox have ever released.<p>We'll see what they make of the franchise.",1366683032

5592935,comment,5591579,5591955,5,0,PommeDeTerre,,,"Prototype-based OO is one of those concepts that sounds good, but it's just not what's actually needed in practice. Class-based OO just happens to be more effective and useful when dealing with real-world problems.<p>I don't think it's a problem with developers not understanding prototype-based OO; they do. It's just that they run into situations time and time again where class-based OO is a better option. Yet since JavaScript doesn't (yet) offer proper class-based OO functionality, developers needing or desiring such functionality are forced to implement it themselves.<p>As anyone who has worked on any sizable, multi-developer JavaScript code base will surely know, there are many different approaches to simulating proper class-based OO in JavaScript. The maintenance headaches this causes are very real.<p>The direction of the JavaScript current is just flat out wrong. It's not that developers should stop swimming against it; they're going in the right direction. The current itself should be reversed so that it aides the developers in the direction they want to go, rather than continually ramming against them.",1366682943

And even when you do have a car, it doesn't feel like a city when getting from a typical home to a D-Backs game takes 45 minutes, and then you have to walk 30 minutes to get from the parking lot, and while you're walking you only pass industrial lots and parking structures).",1366682792

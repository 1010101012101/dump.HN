What do you know about why they are there? There's been no trials, they are only prisoners because the people keeping them say they're guilty of something. So you can't use the fact they are prisoners to decide their honesty, that would be circular reasoning. <i>Both</i> parties have an interest in lying that is almost completely independent of guilt: One has been kept in a secret prison for 11 years subjected to inhumane treatment, and the other side wants to keep a lid on the whole Gitmo thing (maybe even <i>especially</i> if they weren't guilty).<p>Also, 11 years, man. As I said, you don't know what he did, you don't even know what he's being accused of. Stepping aside from the (very real) possibility of him being completely innocent, what if he did do something, maybe it was terrible, or maybe it was something small and stupid that in no way warrants being locked up in Gitmo for 11 years. And in a year from now you'll have to argue that all those people are guilty of a crime that warrants at least 12 years in a terrible prison, and the year after that, and after that, etc. All the while not having a single clue what these people did, what they are accused of.<p>It's pretty obvious that at least <i>one</i> of the sides here is guilty.",1366023368

We are the very same people that once believed the earth is flat, and the people that proved that walking in a straight line between two points has to be less efficient than walking in a circle (the ancient Greeks. Why ? Because a circle is perfect. Despite proving that the shortest distance is just that straight line), were probably smarter than us, at least on average.<p>Then it will just be a big net loss to everyone.<p>Socially useful actually working is predicated on people's rational thinking actually producing good outcomes, and ... well, look at our history. The argument that ""this time"" we'll be right seems a bit unlikely to be true, doesn't it ?<p>The good thing/massive problem with capitalism is that it's an ""intelligent"" algorithm in it's own right, and the conclusions it reaches (the balance on your and everyone else's accounts) are guided by the algorithm, which doesn't care about morals, especially not about the fickle current version (we're < 40 years removed from the prevailing opinion being that skin color determines your worth. In lots of regions that's still true, like large parts of India, or the vast majority of muslim countries).<p>The differences of opinion between people and ""the system"" are not really different from the differences between a dictator and it's subjects. Except, of course that the capitalist algorithmic dictator has several advantages. First, he cannot go mad (before you disagree, read up on a few dictators. It'll put things like the Iraq wars and the patent system in the proper perspective). Second capitalism has actual, real information to base it's conclusion on, and nobody can unduly influence it's opinions for long. Third this dictator doesn't care about race, social status, ... (imho conservatives are not fair when it comes to race and religion (""the poor are immoral"" argument), liberals are not fair when it comes to social status (""the poor are dumb"" argument). I don't want either to stay in power for long).<p>We're switching to a world in which the vast majority of the population is useless, economically. There is no reason for them to be alive, no value in it. There is no way to prevent our capitalist dictator from realizing this is so, and it will -my biology book uses the term ""correct"".

If that's the case, change.<p>I have three bits of advice:<p>1. It could be you're not sleeping enough. Sleep more and drink less caffeine and alcohol.<p>2. If you aim to do a great, great, job of whatever you do, it can become much more rewarding. Be a perfectionist. (nb for some people perfectionism leads to procrastination, but not for most).<p>3. Get on with it. Don't allow yourself to read any further advice on how to be effective. Get up early, get working, work your ass off, have a fixed schedule with breaks and don't try to do long hours. I think an awful lot of people worry too much about productivity rather than just getting on and doing the work. It's also a case of momentum - once you start getting some feedback on what you've achieved, your hard work will feel justified and you'll be more motivated.",1366022260

Theory Y was extreme optimism-- treat them well, and they'll return the favor. Theory Y worked very well until 1980 or so when the yuppie generation sold out their employers' secrets to score private equity jobs, proving that human nature <i>can</i> be quite nasty.<p>Theory Z is the compromise, based on the idea that people are neither altruistic nor egoistic but most, by default, are <i>localistic</i>. They care about the people they spend a lot of time with. They'll screw over ""the company"" given the right incentives, but interpersonal cohesion keeps them honest enough, if it's done right-- at least, in theory. That's Theory Z and while it's the most accurate in its view of human nature (localism, not universal altruism or degenerate egoism) it's still wrongheaded and leads to mediocrity.<p>It fails in several ways. Namely, the only thing people on a ""team"" share is that they report to the same manager. Often, they didn't choose to be on that project (closed allocation) which means they actually share nothing in common. So there's nothing that makes them a team.

Considering that a select few machines could  maintain all the BTC on Earth (hypothetically, if one person owned all of them). A 120W machine consumes 1.1MW in a year, that means that the entire GDP of BTC could be summed up as a very small portion of the running cost of a very small coal power plant.<p>For BTC to get anywhere you need people earning BTC, spending it on goods (to the degree where you can spend it at a supermarket), etc. In addition you need a flow of new BTC into the market as value is added into the market (a farmer grows a crop and by doing so introduce more currency into the market, AKA Gross Domestic Product).<p>The 21 million BTC limit is also extremely naive. Inflation is not caused by more money being minted, it's caused by too much money being minted (when compared to the amounts of goods produced within the producing country). Money needs to flow into the market otherwise you wind up with hyper-deflation: humans, being humans, would hoard the currency and the currency would lose its liquidity. Unfortunately someone needs to valuate the value of the goods flowing into the market and decide how much money to mint based on that - a decision needs to be made which unfortunately means a controlling authority is required.<p>If you could remove the 21 million BTC limit and get a couple of million people to abandon their current currency (dollars, pounds, whatnot) and adopt BTC exclusively, maybe it would work - but valuating physical goods would be tricky, as right now it's valuates on the electricity-producing capacity of a country (which is definitely not its <i></i>gross<i></i> value).<p>BTC has very good motives, unfortunately the way we have set up things (and the way that humans behave) means that it's nothing more than a blue sky dream.",1366021300

Just because you learn the basics of something doesn't make you an expert nor give you the right to a title of said skill. I know the basics of car maintenance and repair, does that give me the right to put, ""Developer and Car Mechanic"" in the title of my website or resume just because I hustled the knowledge of basic engine maintenance and repair?<p>Is Johnny who's been designing websites for 2 weeks now truly able to call himself a designer when Michael who's been designing websites for 12 years is also a designer? It doesn't feel fair that anyone can label themselves based on only little amounts of experience. I guess ""Johnny -  Developer and Junior Designer"" doesn't have the same ring to it, ""Johnny - Developer and Designer"" has.<p>You might be able to learn how to increment a counter, set a timer and master if statements and functions in Javascript in about a week, but you'll never truly learn anything in a week, you're just scratching the surface you don't know about all of the methods the String object has, you don't know about closures, global variables, xmlHttpRequests, prototypes and dealing with arrays. There's a difference between learning something and actually learning something well. Sort of like those, ""Build a blog in 20 minutes"" tutorials most languages love to perpetuate when describing how easy their language or framework is.<p>As for the statement that developers can design, I disagree. It has always bugged me when I see a business advertising for a designer and developer, you can't truly do both at once and do them well, it's merely a way for businesses to skimp on hiring two great people instead of one mediocre at best (if you specialise in $200 websites then maybe it's fine). In my opinion you're either a designer or you're a developer. I'm a developer and I've been trying to design my own sites for my ambitious personal ideas for about 3 years now, but I lack the knowledge of grids, colours, typography, ideal reading lengths, line heights and all of the other advanced aspects a designer faces. If I were to call myself a designer, I would feel like I'm insulting the actual designers that I work with and respect. Most of the designers I work with know a little CSS and HTML but they don't call themselves developers because they know that knowing the basics of something isn't enough to be good or even mediocre at it.<p>Would you trust a car mechanic who decides he's going to give hairdressing a go? We all use different parts of our brains, we have our own likes and interests and these are what make us great at what we decide to do.

Before doing anything, figure out: Is this what I am flowing to do now? Or is it something else ? If I feel like I have to force myself to do something, usually I am doing it against the flow. This is why I hate dayjobs.<p>2. Go for a swim/run/do yoga/meditate. All of these help me to focus better, when my body is relaxed, so is the mind. Create a routine for yourself, when I relax my body right in the morning, it is usually a good day and I get things done. If I skip any of these, it is harder to sit down and stay in one place.<p>3. If something feels impossible, do something else. Dance, go out for a walk, practice close combat weapons, something physical.<p>4. Break the problem into small pieces, write those pieces down. Complete one at a time. Preferably so that each piece has different kinds of things to do, like program, then design, then do some writing. So that it keeps interesting and not just repeating the same thing all day.<p>Also, when I truly have to force myself to complete something, I have found one good technique to get me into the zone: put on my headphones, turn on some good trance/psytrance, and just dance into the zone for 5-10 minutes, then continue coding in this state of trance.

Am I even thinking of the very next step I need to take?<p>Sometimes I need a clearer idea of <i>why I'm doing it</i>. It's very easy to dissociate tasks from the original motivations, and it starts feeling like just ""stuff you gotta do"". So I take a minute and either re-associate the task in front of me with some larger or longer-term goal that is <i>presently</i> appealing (i.e. it doesn't have to be about ""passion""), or I come up with a completely ad-hoc motive like turning it into a game or giving it some kind of constraint that makes it a little more challenging. Sometimes I find that the thing I'm trying to do is actually something I don't care about the original purpose of anymore, which quite suddenly makes it easy to stop and move on to something else.<p>Sometimes I find that I'm missing a <i>sense of confidence that it's what I should be doing right now</i>. It may be that I'm trying to work on a very unimportant thing and should switch to one of the things I keep being distracted by, but I have to consciously compare them before I can realize that that's why I'm getting distracted.

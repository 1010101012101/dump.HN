Obviously some things can be made easier by making shortcuts and making things more predictable when you're writing HTML, but you are still constrained to a textual representation for something that is, by nature, visual. GUI editors would probably be the most natural way of designing web pages but they often produce ugly and inefficient HTML that can be a pain to deal with. IMO there is no better way, except for improving the output of GUI editors.",1369875556

They said that they were willing to sell at the current going rate, which was $42.<p>NASDAQ was unable to process the orders, so they weren't able to process the sales. The resolution they settled on was essentially becoming the other party to the transaction: they would provide the FB shares to the (possibly disgruntled) customers at the same price - as if nothing had gone wrong.<p>But, as this is happening, NASDAQ <i>doesn't actually have FB stock</i> - they have to buy it on the market later. Like a normal short, they benefit if the price goes down since they have to spend less to get back the shares. For example, if FB went down $2, NASDAQ only has to pay $40 for the share, and they make a $2 profit.<p>This is all a long-winded way of saying they didn't have a short in the traditional sense, and in normal cases this doesn't happen, but it happened as a result of this screwup.",1369875178

5790230,comment,5787540,5787540,5,0,Canausa,,,"This issue is common among DNS providers and is difficult to solve. I formerly worked for a major DNS company as a developer and this problem came up all the time.<p>The issue is a problem with how DNS works at the basic level. As a reminder there are 2 types of DNS servers. Authoritative DNS servers serve requests for domains assigned to them. Recursive DNS servers will search out the answer for a domain request by talking to root and Authoritative DNS servers.<p>Now a user trying to access a site could potentially use a recursive DNS server that is located close to them but most people have the option to change who their DNS provider is. In countries where ISP recursive dns servers are slow or fail regularly many users opt to change their recursive dns server. When a user chooses to do so they could pick a recursive dns server that is used in an anycast dns server setup ( As a reminder anycast is an ability to trick the internet in to thinking that alot of servers in many locations look like 1 server and requests are routes to the closest server in anycast ie alot of servers in many data centers all respond to dns requests to the ip address 8.8.8.8).<p>Now with Route53's latency based routing Amazon tracks that the 8.8.8.0/24 subnet could respond fastest in US-East and so any one using google's recursive dns service will be give the dns record corresponding to US-East regardless of the clients IP address ( Amazon only sees a dns request coming from google's ip address not the client ip address). With the dns response the client with that ip address will then connect to the ip address returned from Amazon through google.<p>There are DNS products that can bust through this issue.",1369874004

Then, they pass four years of 60-hour weeks only to find that the executive-level or research (everyone wants to be an executive or in R&D; either controlling others or free from control) roles promised them were given to new hires or don't exist, and they realize they've wasted 4 years of their lives.<p>The lesson isn't ""never work for startups"" because there are great startups and (obviously) awful big-company jobs.

Knowing your percentage doesn't make it any less monopoly money. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5771831"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5771831</a>",1369872117

I'd much rather keep the code simple and try to cut out confusing parts.  Give the flag a better name and remove the useless ternary.  I'd also get rid of the conditional return and let the one outside the catch do the work.<p><pre><code>  if (!errorLogged || (Math.random() < 0.1)) {

I don't suppose there is any way to insure that all these people get their $100, because of the problem of distribution, identity verification, etc. You can't mail them a check. You can't mail them cash. You can't trust local delivery men to do the job (they'll pocket it and say they delivered, or they'll get robbed). 
If you try to provide a service, you'll get knocked down by the bureaucracy. Look at the fiasco around providing identification cards for the poor (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_Identification_Authority_of_India"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_Identification_Authorit...</a>). 
In my opinion, the best way to help the poor in India is to help India become a more prosperous nation, and as such, help the development of education, industry, public safety, environmental safety, research and development, and cultural identity within diversity. This is something the governments of India (national, state, and local) have generally pursued vigorously since independence more than 60 years ago. That the problem with poverty and illiteracy is still so pronounced only demonstrates the magnitude of the task.<p>Look what a long letter I write... I would suggest that the only way to help the people of the slums is for the rest of the people of India to want to help the people of the slums. There has to be a mindset that the majority of people in India adhere to, namely, that poverty is not acceptable, and that the factors that enhance poverty are to be remedied, even if this means pushing aside long-held traditions and ways of doing things.<p>Which is a tall order, even for Bill Gates.<p>So instead he goes after specific problems, such as polio, and it's all good, don't take me wrong, but, huh, it's not nearly as impressive in the grand scheme of things as it's made out to be.",1369872045

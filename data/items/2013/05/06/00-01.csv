Lovelock, being your archetypal scientific maverick got to thinking and with his experience with CFCs and Gaia theory he deduced that all one needed was a telltale signature: a seasonal pattern of waste compounds excreted into the atmosphere. He told Sagan, they trained the appropriate detectors and started looking. Sure enough, there were quite obvious seasonal waste deposit blooms exactly where Lovelock had anticipated. Conclusion: there IS life[-like processes] on Mars. The fact that this was not ""hard"" evidence drove the revelation under the rug because it does not play into the hands of the scientific community as a whole which needed experiments that required us to send probes and develop technologies to get ""hard"" evidence. Which I don't refute is the correct method (we would need this before a categorical ""life on mars"" conclusion could be given the weight of the scientific community), but I think it would be a kind of vindication of Lovelock's brilliance that HIS method is more ""useful"" in the real search for exobiology. Mars is in a very sweet spot that allows us to confirm our suspicions and validate our methods before we go looking and finding this ""life"" shit all over the place (literally).<p>EDIT:<p>as other comments are pointing out I think ""seasonal"" is misused, but I think you get my point.",1367799171

Informal fallacies are context-dependent. Appeals to authority and ad hominems are examples of informal fallacies; neither is intrinsically fallacious.",1367798615

Workers know that they can get a job easily if they have some experience, so many don't return to work after a holiday. Wages have also gone up rapidly there. I just returned from a month in Chana and managed to tour a couple of factories while I was there. The complaint from the factory owners was skilled labor and the price they had to pay to retain them.</i><p><sarcasm>\nSounds terrible! Imagine a world where labor restrictions and regulations are so loose that barely anyone faces unemployment and the companies must attract workers?! The unimaginable horror!",1367798498

5660281,comment,5658538,5659482,2,0,ilaksh,,,"I think the lack of breadth of knowledge and skills in vocational training is a good counterpoint.<p>That is probably one of the biggest problems with skipping the traditional college track.<p>Maybe there is a middle ground that would provide a useful general education at a reasonable price as well as practical up-to-date training with leading edge skillsets and knowledge.<p>Maybe one way to improve education would be to start by incorporating more individualized (probably largely computer-assisted) instruction starting with young children, so that people could advance both their broader as well as more specialized skills and knowledge at their own pace.  That would help many who are held back at times by group instruction as well as people who need to slow down for certain subjects.<p>Maybe there is also room to tune curriculum to provide less depth in certain areas that aren't related to one's chosen specialty.  For example, I only completed about two years of college, but I remember getting through what seemed to be quite an enormous amount of chemistry knowledge and exercises.  I feel that I may not have understood some of the fundamentals quite as well as I wished and that I went into much more depth in some areas of chemistry than was necessary.  I also think that I spent too much time memorizing facts and practicing techniques because the field and curriculum hadn't fully incorporated modern computer tools.<p>Another idea for changing educational institutions: institutionalize life-long learning.  I feel that even though things change on the leading edge of science and technology so quickly that vocational training and apprenticeships are much more effective and realistic approaches to gaining the most practical skills and knowledge, there is so much information available in so many fields, and new information being generated every day, that it makes no sense for an education to be ""completed"" at any set point.  And now that we have so many internet-based tools for education and communication there is no reason for it to stop when people leave the campus.",1367798434
5660280,comment,5659816,5659816,1,0,getdavidhiggins,,,"The following is my opinion, and from personal experience only. Maybe I am wrong, but this is what I gathered over the years:<p>Being naive and saying things rashly without solid, scientific backing is a normal thing. It means you are learning the hard way, and learning things in an un-scientific way, or informal way.<p>In college / school / work / The Internet, we are trained to be as scientific about things as possible, because it looks like we worked hard at getting an answer. i.e - We put thought and effort into our question.<p>Sadly, people ask questions indirectly, or subconsciously. So casually saying:<p>""C is an uninteresting language and no longer relevant.""<p>Is really you trying to understand programming more, even though it seems like a statement.<p>I am basking in the brilliance of this post.<p>To build on top of what you're saying, @tyre ...<p>Even if you reach the brilliance of your peers, and you attain their level ---<p>There will always be somebody else better than you. I know this from personal experience.<p>I am going to speak about this topic in regard to the coding scene on Github:<p>Take for example hacking/coding/dev. When I first started, I had my role models. Expert coders / dev rockstars / whatever.<p>Then when you reach their skill level, some new guy arrives on the scene and blows everyone away.<p>This happens a lot on The Internet, aswell as in real life. But this competition can also be a good thing. It fosters innovation, because who can tell when you supersede your contemporaries and blow their minds too.<p>I've seen it happen. Little johnny unpopular can skyrocket on Github very quickly, and be respected by his role models, overnight. This is the beauty of the social web.",1367798433

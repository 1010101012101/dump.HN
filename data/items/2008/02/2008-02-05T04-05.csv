But of the people I know my parents are the least likely to buy products from the web or sign up for a subscription website. But yes, they do run IE because it came with the computer.<p>On the other hand a lot of my friends run either Ubuntu or OSX and shop online often. They tend to try out new services while they're still in Beta and sign up for paid services.<p>So that's what I personally base my decision on when I take a first cut at building a webapp. YMMV",1202187450

Sure, if you use some library like JQuery or Mootools most of the time your javascript will be cross-platform.

Even if the system is made to be ""fair"" in this way, eventually the term will be made so short as to not be worth the effort of filing the patent. Maybe we are past that point already.",1202186607

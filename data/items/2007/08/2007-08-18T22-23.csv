43919,comment,363,43754,0,0,palish,,,"Yes! Seconded.<p>Alternatively, cap downvoting at 1 karma, so that comments can't go below that threshold.  <p>(Repeating from my previous post): Letting karma go below 1 adds bias to the comment for future readers, but that bias doesn't reflect how they might feel.",1187477479
43918,comment,363,43804,0,0,palish,,,"Not sure I've parsed your grammar correctly, but rewarding the community for participation by letting them downvote only when they reach 20 karma is a good thing.<p>Also, downvoting past 1 karma in general is a bad thing.  It adds bias to the comment for future readers.  <p>It really seems like downvoting in its current form is fine, and if any changes need to be made then capping downvoting at 1 karma might be a good idea.",1187477394
43917,comment,43799,43809,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Graduate school seems like a good place to start a startup. You have a lot of free time[1] to explore interesting ideas, and are surrounded by smart potential co-founders and employees. There is also built in ""life infrastructure"" such as libraries, a gym, people to socialize with, members of the opposite sex to meet, entertainment events, etc. Once you get out into the ""real world"", you have to discover and manage all these details yourself, and they are expensive and time consuming.<p>Arguably, you could get these same benefits by working at a good company like Google, but Google itself sprung out of a graduate school project. Graduate school gives people an environment to think about ""crazy"" ideas in depth. Google wouldn't exist if Larry and Sergey had been employees at Altavista rather than bouncing ideas off of each other at Stanford. <p>[1] a lot of free time compared to a startup, or even a 9-5 grind. (most jobs are 8-6 and require at least some commute)",1187477284

So far, he believes me.<p>The only time I ran into a hitch was when, while having to turn off a portable DVD player because the aircraft was landing, he loudly asked:<p>""But Daddy, <i>why</i> does the movie interfere with the nabigational [sic] equipment?""<p>It didn't seem like a good time to talk about that particular topic.",1187476858

And then laying out why the ideas are quite tame, substantiated, and rational after all, but due to prevailing hip culture, these ideas require a heretic to take root.<p>At least, that's how I read it.",1187476038
43909,comment,43635,43646,0,0,aston,,,"Well, I've personally had titles edited, all for stylistic issues (none for bias, innaccuracy, or anything I'd deem worth editing). I don't really care, but I would prefer that unless my submissions were clearly in need of correction that they were not changed. They do show up under ""submissions"" clicking from my profile, so I think they ought to reflect what I submitted unless it harms the site.",1187475787
43907,comment,43881,43901,0,0,portLAN,,,"A searchable news timeline with the highlights would be handy; zoomed out, only the top stories would show, which makes navigation much more feasible (unlike Slashdot's ""Older Stuff"") -- kind of like the human history timelines we see from time to time, with ""fire"", ""stone tools"", and ""landing on Moon"" as major points, while zooming in a <i>teensy</i> bit more would get you LOLcats.<p>This could be subdivided by category so the above ACM article would show up if you were looking at the top Programming articles, in the 1995 part of the timeline.  Lisp would show up at the end of the 50s.  Kind of puts things in perspective.<p>Under Start-Ups, ""Apple Goes Public"" in 1980; Netscape in 1995; Google in 2004.

43905,story,,,1,2,german,"Users' screen size matters",,"My startup is a webapp, and we have a lot of problems designing the interface, the first one was the users screen size.
We think it should all fit in a 1024 x 768 px screen, of course is the screen is bigger than that, The interface will also look good, 800 x 600 screens is just a problem, we solved it with css (overflow-x) in that way an user could even work with a small screen.
Does any of you have the same problem?

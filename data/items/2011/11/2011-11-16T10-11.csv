It's not about being able to get on Melbourne trains for free, it's about being able to get access to your competitor's research lab, or to their mergers & acquisitions plans, or whatever.  In that context, a few hours and a few thousand euros is absolute peanuts.<p>I used to work for a DRM company, and the physical protections designed into those things (not near-field, just standard smartcards) was ludicrous.  self-destruction on exposure to light.  Measured to ensure that you can't detect good or bad keys by: thermal emissions, electric resistance, electrical consumption, time to respond, and rf emissions.<p>All of that on top of the standard cryptographic requirements makes smartcard design an incredibly challenging proposition, and one that is ultimately futile in my opinion.  For example, the last I heard from friends in the biz was that the crackers are still just using agregate measurements, but what happens when they start using high-res thermal imaging? You'll have to make sure that there is no special hotspot (or coldspot) on the chip when decryption succeeds. The same applies to RF emissions. Not easy.",1321440762

Ok, someone decided that this strangely named construct can also be used to emulate exceptions to a minimal degree (finally statement where? does it support ""bubbling up"" the exceptions over different modules? What if a module redefines signal handlers? I'm also not sure how the error message can be handed over multiple exceptions or how to catch different types of exeptions.. can probably be done but only by bloating up the code unnecessarily). The man page of eval shows a lot of issues and broken cases. This is the preferred way to do exceptions? Really?<p>Interesting link on your use of ""if ($@)"": <a href=""https://www.socialtext.net/perl5/exception_handling"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.socialtext.net/perl5/exception_handling</a> 
It looks like it's not a good idea to do that, because it's a global variable (which in itself shows bad design decisions in the language itself, IMHO).<p>Finally, why are there myriads of Exception modules and Error handling modules and die/croak/carp modules, if it's already working so good in the base language? All of them try to solve problems in the base language (most of them even state that they exist because of quirks and problems in Perl on their man page). I never came across the need of looking for a replacement for those in another language...<p>> Yes, Perl assumes that you did not sleep through ""Introduction to Data Structures"". If the operation of ""find out of collection X contains element Y"" is one that you need to do often and/or need to be more efficient than linear search, you should not be using an array.<p>If i would care that much about speed i would expect the language to have an efficient C/asm implementation and not rely on millions of programmers to do it right. It's no magic, it's expected to just be there, by me.
Plus, not everyone that uses Perl is a good programer and this encourages bad behavior and hideous code which could just be avoided. Besides, i write lots of network heavy code. I could run multiple seti@home instances in parallel and not slow the script down. Tbh, i don't care about the speed of this operation. I far more care about convenience. It's not convenient for me to have to read and debug array search operations of other people because they didn't get it right.<p>One example: I was debugging a clients script and somehow for very few elements out of millions the script failed. Reason: He used regex to compare/search for elements which broke when the element contained a dot, which translated to the regex special character. It was easy to fix but it was a pain in the ass to find.<p>Another example:
I had to review and maintain code at a client (mind you this is a Dr. and shouldn't be that stupid. Nowadays i think he shouldn't even program ever again but this is a real case!): He obviously wasn't able to figure this out a nice way and wrote a lot of code to put single elements into a string and separate each element by a predefined string (#### in this case). Afterwards he was using regex with #### and ######## and added and removed those limiters and what not. It was a horrible day for me to read this and took hours to even figure out what he tries to achieve. Imo, this person shouldn't touch an editor ever again, but the point here is: I bet you 100$ that he wouldn't have done this in Java or Python or Ruby or whatever, just because it's easy to do in those languages.<p>Another point is: Very often i came across the recommendation to convert the array to a hash and then check for the key. What recommendation is that? When i have a data structure that is best represented as array, convert it for a simple operation? ugh...",1321440049

From the end of the article:<p>> Pratchett, the creator of the Discworld novels who was 60 when he was diagnosed, said his decision to start the formal process did not necessarily mean he was going to take his own life.<p>I'm stressing this because the headline makes it sound like he will be taking his own life in the near future.

Entrepreneurs need to not only have a great idea and successfully manage their business but also to be careful not to sell too much of the business too soon. ...  In part, [Zuckerberg owning 24% of Facebook right now] was a result of aggressively setting a valuation for his company early, ensuring that Mr. Zuckerberg kept substantial ownership. A high valuation benefited Mr. Zuckerberg because he needed to sell less stock to raise the same amount of money.""<p>The article suggests that you should fight for aggressively high valuations.<p>There is a flipside to this. Setting your valuation aggressively high only benefits you if you win big. As Chris Dixon and others have warned (e.g. <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/08/fred-wilson-platforms-valuations/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/08/fred-wilson-platforms-valua...</a>), a too-high valuation can lead to a down round if you don't meet expectations. This can harm your company and make it <i>harder</i> to raise your next round.<p>So following the advice of this article is a risky gambit. You can't anticipate all roadblocks or obstacles that could prevent your company from growing as much as you intended when you raise that money. You can't control all external factors, e.g. the economy. It's your choice if you want to roll the one-hundred sided die.",1321437855

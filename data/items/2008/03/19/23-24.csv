141265,comment,140808,140808,0,0,brent,,,"I'm not a statistician, but if I read the paper correctly ... there is barely a negative correlation in his 2006 study (if you remove the one significant anamoly).  n=18 in his 2002 study and n=16 in 2006.  He controlled for age and years of active publishing which may be correlated to consumption.  In fact, he conveniently removed the 1st principal component in the 2002 study and not in the 2006 and covered it by an offhand remark of ""almost quantitatively identical"".  If they were almost quantitatively identical why did he remove it from one study and not the other.  Oh!  Well, earlier in the paper he mentions that the results were only consistant between the two studies when he controlled for age.  The median consumption of the 6 bohemians in his 2002 study is 200 litres/per year(!!!) and the remaining 12 Moravians drink 37.5 litres/per year (which is quite the bimodal distribution).  The 2006 study were the same people as in 2002 ""where available"".  So n=16 for the entire study.  They are all researchers in ""avian evolutionary biology and behavioural ecology"" in the country with the highest per capita beer consumption rate in the world.  Hardly a meaningful dataset in my eyes.  Then again, maybe I'm biased in my analysis.  Beer drinkers unite!",1205971064

A lot of how someone interprets your year depends on who's looking at your resume (they're not obsolete, no matter what anyone says).  If on one hand you're applying to JP Morgan, there's a chance a hiring manager might not like the fact that your history isn't driven by credentialed companies.  On the other, if you're applying to a Valley firm--another startup or someone like Google or Yahoo, they're likely to think your experience was valuable and showed initiative and guts.",1205970247

141241,comment,141137,141137,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"This game looks simple on the surface, but it must have some interesting physics code inside.<p>This reminds me of a tool that was developed by ParaGraph back in 90s (the same company that developed handwriting recognition for Apple's Newton). Their app allowed creating TrueType characters by drawing a simple raster image. This is <i>stunningly</i> impressive if you consider that TrueType is essentially defined by geometric splines. Converting raster image into a set of curves is an <i>extremely</i> unobvious thing to do, but on the surface the whole thing looked quite ordinary and trivial.<p>Same thing with Crayon Physics - trivial on the surface, but complex on the inside. And <i>this</i> is what's impressive about it.",1205968996

Having both done a startup that didn't go big and now one that looks like it will turn into something big I thing your points are very well made.<p>As you say, history is written by the winners and about the outliers and totally glosses over the truth for the average majority (and the destructive lows of the minority).<p>As all of us know who've done it though, doing a business is something that's just in your blood. Most of us who do it didn't do it because we chose to, only because we had to.<p>I once asked Marc Hedlund a little about the failure of the startup he did before Wesabe. He said it was bad but on balance he didn't feel he came out too badly since he didn't lose his wife or go bankrupt. Enough said.<p>The highs are insanely high but it's worth writing about the lows too because there's a whole lot of cult around the startup scene that lures people into decisions that can be destructive.",1205968065

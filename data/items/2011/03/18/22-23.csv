2342364,comment,2340732,2341979,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"I have no idea how practical it would be to hire developers in India but you live outside the country. That's basically outsourcing, or perhaps a remote workplace. Some companies do it well (DeviantArt, Morgan Stanley), some suck at it (Boeing). Lots has been written on outsourcing, I have little to add to it.<p>However, I didn't mean to imply that you personally need to stay outside the country. It's unlikely you will be harmed - India isn't Russia, after all. I just meant that corruption is rampant and you should plan your business to minimize the impact.<p>As for IP theft, IP is probably about as secure as anyplace else (i.e., not very). How can you prevent `git clone ~/src/important_startup_code /media/usb`? Banks use PS2 mice/keyboards and put glue in every single USB port, not to mention paying for a massive surveillance infrastructure. Good luck with that.<p>The primary risk unique to India is that the courts are worthless. You can't get an injunction to stop them from building their own startup with your code, all you can due is sue and maybe win in court in 20 years (unless they bribe the judge).",1300489013

Instead, he told her that the whole idea of customer support was ridiculous. Rather than assuming the unscalable task of answering users one by one, Page said, Google should enable users to answer one another’s questions.<p>That explains a few things... I wonder why they they even bothered writing Google Forums, they could have just thrown phpBB at it and call it a day.",1300488949

2342354,comment,2341715,2341715,0,0,fingerprinter,,,"Yesterday when I saw his comment on twitter I almost fell into the ""someone on the internet is wrong!"" trap, but today I feel I can't resist.<p>Almost everything about this angers me. It's presumptuous, arrogant, intellectually lazy and fallacy driven. And worst, Alex not only thinks he's correct, but morally right! Absurd!<p>Lets start at the top.<p>1. ""If selling subscriptions to a small web application to cover my mortgage and subsidize my hobbies is “freedom”, then I’ll happily risk incarceration."" - All Alex is really saying is that he defines ""freedom"" a different way than x person. You can't really judge that. Perhaps be perplexed, maybe inquisitive, but don't judge. In this regard, to each their own. And please don't confuse what makes you happy with what makes someone else happy. Alex is saying that obligation makes him happy. Great! Go for it. Someone else is saying that taking care of their family and living a simple live makes them happy. Cool...<p>""Seek first to understand, then be understood"".<p>2. ""When I read statements like this, my secular humanist streak flares up. ... We should endeavor to improve the lives of as many people as possible in a lasting and significant way, making the most of our own skills in the process."" - Uhm...wow? This is nearly a nonsensical statement, saved merely by the fact that I _think_ I know what he is trying to say. Several problems arise from this statement, the first being that he brings in Humanism. Humanism, meant to enlighten perspective, only clouds the statement with doubt. Secondly, ""should"" is a word that will always get you into trouble with regard to other people. ""Should"" implies ""I know better than you"" or ""let me tell you why you are wrong"" not ""hmmm..interesting perspective but I've always been of the mind that "" which is a conversation, not an attack.<p>Lastly, it is worth noting that the statement is cute in that it provides an ego boost for the person espousing it, the statement itself is nearly worthless alone. I suspect that the statement serves to boost ones ego more than it serves to guide ones life. It also smacks of a statement made by someone with very little life experience.<p>3. ""Building a business around maximizing your individual happiness is not particularly useful or admirable. That is my position, and I’m well aware that it may be unpopular with some."" - Equivocation. Alex is not using the ""term"" happiness to talk about this side of things, but that is what it is. He is striving to find meaning/happiness on his own terms in his own way: by going big and making an impact. Deriding someone for doing the same thing in a different way is, at best, silly, at worst, narcissistic.<p>I would like to leave with a story about a country doctor I knew. He worked for 40 years in the bush in Australia. He loved living there and it was where he grew up. He was able to make a good living working there and being the small town country doctor and generally found happiness doing it. He told me about when he did a rotation in the UK and was offered a job starting a new hospital. He would have been able to reach massively more people in one year than he could in his entire work life in the country, make tons more money and have a hugely beneficial impact. He turned it down and went back to Australia. His reasoning ""someone other than me would have taken and done that job, but that same person was unlikely to help these people in this town.""",1300488767

2342295,story,,,14,0,code,"Looking for a Technical Cofounder",,"Hi HN,<p>I'm looking for a technical co-founder to help build my new startup with. I want to be clear I'm not just some business guy with an idea as I know that's probably a huge deal breaker for some on here and that I am technical and understand code myself. To be clear, I'm not knocking on business guys. Everyone has their own values and what they bring to the table. That said, I am extremely hard working and will do whatever it takes to succeed. I'm looking for a dedicated partner who shares the same drive and passion to build with.<p>For some background reference, I've previously sold my last startup with over a dozen employees and we were net profitable at the time of acquisition so I do have some experience building, growing, and exiting a startup from scratch. I'm not saying this to brag or as if my past results is any indication of future success, because it's not. I still strongly believe you got to work hard and hustle to make things happen. I only bring it up to state I have experience and know what I'm doing. I've been involved on all sides of the business and beyond the technical side, and I have strong business and marketing skills which I think is a plus.<p>I'm currently working on a shopping decision engine. The premise on how the idea works is something I have strong domain expertise and stem from a personal pain point I had. Basically I'm trying to help bring value to shoppers and ultimately help recommend products and services down the road base on what their looking for or base on what they've purchased. It's not some check-in app or daily deal type site/app. I promise you it's a lot more exciting than it sounds and have it's differences from other shopping related startups out there.<p>I've been developing the MVP for about 3.5 months now and although it's not complete and ready for launch yet, I have put together a demo for those interested. I've garnered a group of alpha testers (actual customers that want to try out the product) ready for launch. I have important contacts and industry experience to make the product happen, and I have marketing strategies in place to really bring the product to market. I assure you I'm not one of those guys who say word of mouth and some kind of social media marketing. I have a very strong background in running real traffic, optimization, A/B testing, and proven results in getting products out there.<p>I'm not looking for just a programmer. I'm looking for a partner. If you're just a developer or someone looking for something to do part time or a job, we're probably not a fit. It is important to me to find the right person to work with regardless of how skillful you are and that our ideals align correctly. So why am I looking for a partner? Simply put, theres a LOT to do, more than I can do alone and I strongly believe in building a great team to accomplish great things. Moving forward, I'm looking for someone who is looking to work on something they find they're passionate about and wants to gung ho it 110%. If you love code, and have a passion for startups, and what to be the lead architect moving forward, I'm interested in talking to you. At this moment, it's just me working on this full time. You must be local to the bay area (I'm in Mountain View). I need to work with people face to face and perfer to jam it out in person.<p>If it matters, everything thus far is developed in PHP on the LAMP stack on EC2. There was no particular reason for choosing PHP other than familiarity. That said, I've been meaning to look into Python more (although at this point I don't really know anything Python). If you're a PHP or Python dev, or someone fast on the uptake with code, feel free to reach out to me. I'd love to talk to everyone. You should also know Javascript and jQuery. My contact info is in my profile. If you have any questions about the idea/product, anything I've posted here, or about me, please include it in the email. Would be much easier to go over everything on a Skype call than responding here via HN. Thanks.",1300487805

The challenges of having Google be more 'startupy' are many, some that immediately come to mind;<p>* Part of the allure of joining a smaller organization is that you can have a huge impact, creating a business from nothing to $10M/year is huge. At Google adding $10M/yr to the bottom line is chump change and you're a chump if that's all you can do.<p>* One of the great things about smaller organizations is that not only does everyone have a general understanding of the big picture, they have a lot of respect for each other too. Google has grown so complex in its execution that nobody could honestly claim to know how it all works, and of the few who come closest they can't scale to be as many places as they need to be. There is an inverse square law that your level of respect at Google is 1/Jd^2 where Jd is your ""Jeff Dean"" number.<p>* Start ups in particular get focus from solving a problem that is painful enough that someone will pay you for your solution, Google invents problems that nobody has and then has to give away their work to get any traction at all.<p>* Start ups can fire their hardware vendor, pick and choose their own software, build methodology, hiring practices. All of those things are mandated at Google.<p>Next up I'm afraid is a big poster imploring people to ask themselves, ""Is this good for Google?"" That would be sad indeed.<p>I know adults who would like to simplify their lives to get back to a lifestyle that is more like the one they had in college.

A business that will be worth $20 million if everything goes right is likely to end up near zero. The distribution is non-normal and most companies don't reach 50 or even 25 percent of their maximum potential, but less than 1 percent.

Most software produced is sloppy and buggy with bad APIs, most decisions are made based on economic factors, and most programmers are seriously underskilled, which wastes the time of the skilled. (I love strong static typing, though. The guy who is always breaking APIs actually has to fix his shit.) Even in startups, most of the code is hastily written by necessity. Moreover, technology is the best industry out there. Software sucks, but everything else sucks more.<p>I realize I'm hijacking your line of thought, but here's a problem that could be solved with enough thought put into it. Most smart people really want to work and, when they're motivated, will work very hard and very creatively. But less than 10% of people are doing what they want to do or are really motivated to do it well, so we have a shitty world where most people don't give a fuck. Most people, by age 35, are just jaded clock-punchers who just do what they're told because it's the path of least resistance. We're different; we're idealistic and trying to fight that trend, but ""the enemy"" (the ocean of suckitude outside our borders) is winning.<p>So, let's solve <i>that</i> problem. Let's not just fix the software industry. Let's fix work. There are millions of creative people out there with amazing ideas not getting implemented, while the very rich get to implement their shitty ideas and impose them on the rest of the world.

I took the more comic-y ones and put them up on a server I was testing out, and got a bunch of readers when BoingBoing linked to me. I started drawing more seriously, gained a lot more readers, started selling t-shirts on the site, and am currently shipping t-shirts and drawing this comic full-time. It's immensely fun and I really appreciate y'all's support.</i><p><a href=""http://xkcd.com/about/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/about/</a>",1348707591

Not everybody will choose to become an engineer solely because that is the most economically rational thing for them to.<p>If employers offer higher wages (which has clearly been happening; starting salaries are above $100k these days in the valley) they can at best hope to attract employees from other employers that are offering less (although there may be non-monetary factors at work as well) but that does not change the fundamental imbalance between supply and demand.<p>I could go on in this vain, but seriously, pick up an economics textbook before spouting off this nonsense.",1348706156

4578724,comment,4578059,4578443,15,0,anon987,,,"Here's my view as a veteran UNIX / Linux guy who's almost done with his search:<p>>> They like to hide, he says. Marketing people, sales people, product people will network. Engineers, theyre very timid about giving out contact information for themselves or anyone else.<p>Rule #1 about posting your resume on Dice or Monster: Your phone number is 000-000-0000 - screen via e-mail.  I don't enjoy multiple interruptions in my day because you either A) matched a couple keywords or B) e-mailed me and I haven't responded.  Don't be ""that guy"" who e-mails a person, calls them and says ""did you get my e-mail??""  I have got most of my jobs from Dice, they've been good to me, but there's no way I'm exposing myself to recruiter spam via telephone.<p>Same goes for references: I make it 100% clear that when I give out references they are ONLY to be used as references for this position and nothing more.  If my references start getting calls from your company about 'opportunities' they contact me, I call the company, start chewing people out, AND I've got it in writing.<p>A tip for newer job seekers: Provide references after the interview, not before.  The recruiter or company contacted you on the strength of your resume and not who your references are.<p>On another quick note: References are obsolete.  Managers from larger companies can't give good or bad references due to fear of being sued and what are you gonna do - give your worst enemy as a reference?<p>>> Its the fear of the unknown, he says. Everyone is afraid of hiring the wrong person, and if they would just trust that they know how to ask the right questions, then everyone wouldnt be complaining as much about recruiting.<p>Get your fucking interviews in order, take time and actually do it.  I've had so many interviews where it's clear that the interviewers did not read my resume and did not have questions ready to go - they just played it off the cuff.  I took the time to tailor my resume to your organization but you can't get your interviewers together for 15 minutes to read my resume and create questions to ask?  You're showing me right off the bat that your company either can't or doesn't plan for a six figure investment (me, the candidate, the guy that will be sitting next to you).<p>>> But instead of asking the right questions and hiring a candidate whos qualified, Marcus says that startup founders will take a candidate in based on a personal recommendation or an impressive company name on a resume, usually branching outside the original specification they wrote and usually regretting the decision in the long run.<p>This is very true because it's easy to hide and do nothing or know nothing at a large company.  At a 10 person startup if you don't know what you're doing people are gonna figure it out - fast.<p>>> And the truth hes seen in the past decade is that our insecurity is getting the best of us. The big problem in general is fear, he says. To counter their fear, companies make their standards too high and turn down people who would be great at their jobs.<p>Job descriptions are getting stupid and out of control - they seem to be like a child's wish list at Christmas.  Nevermind positions with low salary but do you really expect people to know C/C++ and be a Linux guru?  Both a Windows pro and a Cisco wizard?  Take 30 seconds and think about it: How many of those people REALLY exist in the world?  500?  How many are looking for a job?  1, 2?  And last but not least, are they really going to want to work for your random company for 90k a year with skills like that?  Unless they are completely insecure and clueless the best of the best techies know their worth.<p>The other thing is listing requirements for the wrong reasons.  I don't know Ruby and shy away from jobs that want it, but if you really just want someone who knows Ruby for Puppet then that's easy - it's just copy existing manifests and update the variables / settings for the new host, but you scared me off by projecting that you want a sysadmin + programmer when you listed Ruby + Python + C + perl.<p>Companies are also forgetting the root of IT: Adapting to new technologies.  C'mon, I know ABC App is what you're looking for but I've been doing this for ages and changed with the times.  Do you really think I can't read vendor docs and other web resources to come up to speed when I meet 80% of your other requirements?  That and the old ""everything old is new again"" saying.  Unless it's something completely new a mindblowing chances are I can use my knowledge of older systems to understand the fundamentals of the new ones - you won't need to teach me the fundamentals of high availability from scratch.<p>>> Everyone wants the next Steve Wozniak to walk through the door, but really, they should be asking to see if they can do the job.  They want to populate their entire staff with engineering geniuses, and you dont need the whole staff to be engineering geniuses. You need a couple really bright people who know what theyre doing, and then, just dont turn down people who can do the job.<p>I always laugh at places where almost every position wants something like ""leadership skills.""  What happens when you have an organization where everyone has strong leadership skills?  You have too many cooks in the kitchen, that's what.  Understand that most people are better suited to a follower role - I know I am.<p>>> The great mystery and the core principle of recruitment, Marcus says, is at once simple and nearly impossible: Find a better candidate. The elusive better candidate, he tells me, can come from anywhere.<p>This goes hand-in-hand with the first quote about great engineers not making themselves known.  While you look for that ""better candidate"" he's interviewing with and getting offers from other companies.<p>Lately I have been flat out telling recruiters ""I get 10 or 15 e-mails per day so I'm not putting my entire job search on hold for one possibly maybe nothing-in-writing-yet opportunity.  If your company wants me, they need to step up and come get me.""  Seeing as how recruiters and employers love to keep potential employees in a holding pattern for weeks or months I'm not going to let life pass me by, sorry.<p>Expanding on that, I also take the ""send it and forget it"" approach because I never know how quick or slow a company will respond - low expectations make for a happier life.<p>PS: Hey dumbass recruiters and employers: Make REAL job descriptions.  Oh your only requirements are Linux and VMware?  Sounds incredibly vague and doesn't grab my interest unless the job is in Hawaii.  We have an interview and you go into all sorts of technologies that you expect me to design / admin but the job description didn't mention them?  Lose/lose because I don't get any time to review them and you're getting bad candidates.  Recruiters who can't provide detailed job descriptions?  That's like going to Taco Bell and saying ""give me food.""<p>PPS: DevOps a buzzword, the old term is ""teamwork.""  You probably shouldn't keep sysadmins that don't want to interact with the devs or are so insecure that they can't let devs control when and how they deploy their code...",1348705771

In the two-level path finding system I wrote for my homebrew MUD as a kid, I precomputed all pairwise shortest paths within each zone (a zone had on the order of 100 rooms) and then all pairwise shortest paths between zone-to-zone transitions (a typical zone had around 5 transitions and each transition belongs to two zones). With these tables, here's all you need to do to find a shortest path between a given pair of rooms:<p>If the two rooms are in the same zone, consult the intra-zone table for their zone and you're done. Otherwise, for both rooms, find the shortest paths to all transitions in their current zone using the intra-zone tables. Let's say there are 5 transitions in both zones. Then for each of the 20 transition pairs, consult the inter-zone table to find the shortest path between them. That gives you a small set of candidate paths (at most 20 in this example) and you pick the shortest among them.<p>That's 5 + 5 + 20 = 30 fast table lookups and a comparison of 20 numbers to find the shortest path between any pair of rooms.<p>The storage cost for this is (100 * 5 / 2) * ((100 * 5 / 2) - 1) / 2 bytes ~= 30 kilobytes for the inter-zone table and 100 * (100 * 99 / 2) bytes ~= 500 kilobytes for the intra-zone tables. That wasn't a trivial amount of memory in those days but it wasn't prohibitive either. Compare that to 10,000 * 99,999 / 2 bytes ~= 50 megabytes for directly storing shortest paths between all pairs of rooms. You couldn't store all that in memory and having to read from disk would more than wipe out the 30:1 advantage in the number of lookups versus the two-level approach.<p>I'm sure you see the analogy with road networks and highways: a transition is like a highway exit, etc. The important point is that there is a way of decomposing the connectivity graph into subgraphs such that only a small number of edges enter and leave each subgraph.<p>You can see in my calculation that almost all the space is taken up by the intra-zones tables. It would certainly help to compute intra-zone shortest paths on demand with caching, as you suggest.",1348705445

I started with Apache. Apache probably works fine if you load the mpm-oh-you-didnt-know-about-mpm-so-sorry module.<p>My next stop was lighttpd. A fine piece of software, with a persistent bug that caused it to drop into a 500 state if FastCGI instances were ever unavailable.<p>So now I'm on Nginx. And with some fancy footwork in the rewrite rules to support WP Super Cache, it can serve static files and gzipped HTML straight off disk.<p>Unsurprisingly, in this configuration, it runs like the clappers.[1][2]<p>One thing that always surprises me is seeing configurations where Nginx is merely a proxy or load balancer into a bunch of Apache instances. Are you nuts? Stop doing that. Just use Nginx and FastCGI -- thank me later.<p>[1] At least, it used to do this, until I updated everything and it silently stopped working the way it used to (which I only discovered while outlining my current config in comments below). I mean, thanks to memcached and closer servers and running Percona on a separate server it's <i>still</i> pretty fast, but this change bugs me and you can bet I'll be fixing it later today after work.<p>[2] Two optimisations I've dropped are the MySQL query cache and a PHP opcode cache.<p>The query cache because I don't think it buys me enough versus using memcached (just a gut feel, I've got no hard numbers to back me up) and because it often turns into a contention point in read-heavy MySQL instances. Also, by dropping it I can free up more memory for InnoDB.<p>The opcode cache because they tend to be flaky. I've had bad experiences with all three major ones. If you ever pop Wordpress up on a profiled PHP instance you find that its time is spent overwhelmingly on waiting for MySQL, concatenating strings and then streaming it out to the webserver, for which proper on-disk/in-memory caching is the answer. Time spent loading and compiling .php is minimal by comparison, so why put up with the hassle?<p>I don't use varnish because the whole philosophy is to let the OS select what to cache in memory, and ... well I already do that.

I'm not sure if all readers are as aware as many HN participants that some long-established journalistic organizations host blogging webpages that have no editorial oversight.

I only have anecdotal and personal experience to back this up, but I believe that a vast majority of people familiar with both Python and C would much prefer the former for Web development (as you do).<p>Looking at the big picture, computers are so ubiquitous now because they provide significantly better tools for all kinds of businesses. It&#x27;s fairly obvious that programmers themselves can also benefit from improved tools. And our main tools are programming languages - although there are obviously also other parts to the puzzle (IDEs, compilers, build + deployment + CI systems). I think we are already better in that some of our mainstream languages today are nicer to use than most of those 30 years ago. However, the difference is not huge, and my impression is that the language development was largely done from personal experience of individual language creators, and has largely ignored the research advances made in the area of programming languages. Notable exceptions are garbage collection, and Clojure and Haskell (if we can consider them mainstream).<p>Now of course, there are other, both non-technical considerations that are also affected by language choice. Availability of libraries or programmers are obvious examples. But the real question is of course whether incorporating these advancements offers a real, measurable benefit, and I think that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re hinting at. The problem is that the benefits are hard to measure in a sensible way. Frankly, I don&#x27;t think that the metric you propose (which, if I understand correctly, is &quot;measure the cost/revenue ratio of projects in language X at company Y against the average ratio for all projects at company Y) can give reliable answers. How do you measure the revenue of something like Haxl? I think the language choice is going to remain a personal decision in the end.",1428269654

Particularly interesting is the reaction from laypeople, such as those on Reddit, to technology leaders expressing their worry over the future of AI.<p>Without having read into the matter at all, the mass seems to be comfortable with writing off Musk, Gates, Hawking, etc. as wringing their hands unnecessarily, and besides they&#x27;re not AI experts so why should we care anyway?<p>There seems to be a gross misconception with what AGI would be and what it would mean for us, and an apathetic view to the cautious approach many are advocating regarding its development on grounds such as:<p>i) They&#x27;ll never make a machine as intelligent as a human. Even if they do, we can still program it to do what we like.<p>ii) Anything developed to have the intelligence of a human will come to love our species or can be taught to love our species.<p>iii) Any artificial intelligence developed will be single task orientated and will not go outside of those boundaries.<p>iv) Artificial intelligence will be developed by eccentric enthusiasts and will therefore not be developed to do wrong.<p>Bostrom, in Superintelligence, has said that AGI is will be the last great challenge of our species. If we get it right, we will win, if we get it wrong we are doomed.<p>The problem there being we will not know if we have got it right until it is too late to do anything about it regardless.<p>With that being said, if we are to develop something that is:<p>i) Objective<p>ii) Purely logical<p>iii) More intelligent than our species combined<p>iv) Has free access to the complete knowledge we have produced<p>Then I simply cannot see a way that it will not go against us. If we were to observe a species acting in the manner we as a species do on this planet - to our own species, to other species and to the planet/environment/ecosystem as a whole - I cannot see how we would not categorize that species as a disease, a cancer, something to be eradicated.<p>Combined with the fact that the actors that will be involved in AGI - capitalists, the government and the military - I cannot see how it works out well for us.",1428268636

And should we begin to desalinate sea water, one of its potential &quot;waste products&quot; is excess lithium.<p>But that said, the real &quot;win&quot; comes when we have capacitors which are mechanically storing charge.<p>Today you have two choices, one is a &quot;plate&quot; capacitor which builds up a separation of charges between two plates, limited by the dielectric constant of the material holding the plates apart, and chemical separation of charge by binding electrons to the atomic structure of two materials that can will exchange electrons given the opportunity.<p>Mechanical storage of charge will probably involve a nanostructure of dendrites and spheres which are filled and emptied using magnetic fields. An early example was magnetic bubble memory which the presence or lack of charge in a small bubble, moved through a &quot;racetrack&quot; by manipulating the fields around the bubbles could be &quot;read&quot; or &quot;written&quot;. If the charge carrying capacity of the bubbles was significantly improved, one could imagine a device where each bubble stays within the dielectric limits of carrying charge, but the total population of bubbles holds significant charge. As with the chemical process an internal &quot;resistance&quot; is present by the mechanical limitation of pulling charge out of the device (that is the rate of chemical reaction in a battery) but unlike a chemical battery such a device would by &quot;fillable&quot; at the same rate as it was &quot;drainable&quot;.",1428268406

The agent is capable of extreme self improvement on exceedingly short timescales (minutes to days).<p>2. The AI is pretty much a rational bayesian<p>3. A resource conflict will occur between humans and the AI, and humans will lose because the AI is so much smarter/faster/more powerful than us.<p>If you accept those premises, then AI really does seem pretty scary, but we have yet to actually realize an agent that is anywhere close to 1 or 2.<p>On the other hand, the research directions proposed at the super secret AI conference in Puerto Rico[1] (where incidentally, all the people in title got together) make me nervous.
Essentially, the goal is that, if we manage to create these superhuman AIs, they should be somehow validated to do what we want them to do[2], be secure against later manipulation, and if all else fails, be controllable by humans monitoring the agent.
The obvious questions would be &quot;will this work with certainty?&quot;, or &quot;who gets to control the AI?&quot;.

9325341,comment,9324555,9324555,0,0,hedgew,,,"Becoming better or more successful by reading about biases seems difficult. After reading Kahneman, Ariely, and others, I&#x27;ve sort of come to the conclusion that a lot of people naturally behave in a way that exploits others&#x27; biases. These people gain a slight edge (or many) in life. However, learning to avoid or exploit biases is very difficult - unless you just have the kind of personality that already benefits from many biases.<p>For example, Steve Jobs could be thought of as having a personality which benefits from many biases. A few that I remember instantly: overconfidence bias (others believe you more if you&#x27;re confident) and halo effect (one positive thing, like good looks, makes people think that you&#x27;re good in other things too). Probably many others. Any one of these alone - probably wouldn&#x27;t result in much. He hit a delicate balance, and his personality just worked out. He probably didn&#x27;t know anything about bias research, and emulating the success of his personality by studying biases would be nigh impossible. Of course, biases aren&#x27;t the sole reason for his success, but can explain parts of his life, and how he influenced people.<p>So studying biases helps us a little. You learn to understand human behavior a little better. You can maybe fine-tune some parts of your personality. Most stereotypical geeks for example, probably don&#x27;t act confidently enough. But changing your behavior radically to avoid or exploit biases is still very difficult.",1428268200

Travelling to the UK, France, Spain, Italy, or Switzerland is easier from other parts of the continent.<p><i>The amazing, delicious dner kebabs</i><p>I like kebabs as much as the next guy and it's probably true that you can get the best ones in Berlin, but let's be honest, it's drunk food and often made from questionable ingredients.<p>That said, there really is lots of awesome food in Berlin in all price categories and from all the cuisines of the world. In fact, eating out in Berlin is such a great experience in general that I'm not sure why kebabs deserve special mention.<p>Again, I love Berlin and maneesh's other points hold true, I just don't think it needs to be glorified beyond what it is -- a wonderful, amazing city that isn't the most pretty one and isn't really the very best location in Europe in terms of climate and travelling options.<p>@maneesh: don't take this the wrong way, glad to hear you've had a great time, sounds like a lot of fun!",1320969554

Use encryption key fingerprints as the host addresses, so that this works well with end-to-end encryption.<p>- Tor-like onion routing.<p>- Key-fingerprint-based host naming, making DNS an optional (and selectable) directory service rather than a required core component.  Of course, having end-to-end encryption means you can easily select a DNS server which gives you correct results, rather than one with various entries redirected to governmental agencies.<p>With all of the above, you have a network where you can't prevent or intercept any communication, without pulling the plug on the entire infrastructure at the hardware level.  And even then, the pervasive availability of mesh networking means that packets can find and use any available egress, which includes satellites, cell towers, and long-distance wifi.",1320969353

Of course, ""legitimacy"" would be incredibly narrowly defined. So we're going to ban all use of people's likenesses... unless it's by tourists. Or journalists. Or for the protection of private property (e.g., CCTV), or...?<p>IMO this would simply result in a <i>net loss of freedom</i> for everyone involved. To main some semblance of normality, we'd force people working in tourist-heavy areas to sign over blanket photographic rights so the tourists can continue taking snapshots without fear of legal repercussion. As opposed to right now where people still hang onto their own inalienable rights. This would probably become de rigeur for anyone with any significant facing to the public - aid workers, people marching in a parade, etc etc. So in the end instead of simply <i>having rights</i>, we by default just sign everything away in a tome of a contract that's hardly comprehensible to anyone so that life can, well, continue.<p>It's hard to imagine a worse case of regulatory over-reach.",1320968607

If you drew a cultural and demographic vector from Berlin through Munich to Zurich, you'd have a pretty good picture of what Zurich is like. If that sounds like a mixed bag, that's because it is. ;-) Even richer, even better working, but also even stuffier. I love it there but that's because many of my friends are there.<p>What is true, though, is that Switzerland has a better business culture and regulatory/tax environment. People work quite hard, they are very rational and pragmatic in business matters, and the universities there are, unlike the German ones, truly world class. I'd also wager, although I've not (yet?) tried myself, that it will be easier to raise capital from Swiss investors than from Munich-based ones (and Berlin, as someone already mentioned, doesn't really have serious capital floating around).<p>It's all a wash though, I'm sure that these generalities have marginal impact on whatever you or I do or decide.

While some partisan voters may have arrived at their convictions through reason and analysis, many more are of the ""angry voter"" mentality.<p>A voting system such as Australia's, which encourages everyone to vote, seems in principle less susceptible to hacking by special-interests. It is inevitable and sometimes good that highly-opinionated minorities gain outsize political weight relative to a passive majority, but we do not need the election system to make it too easy to do so.<p>In effect, maximizing voter participation should align government more closely to the actual will of the governed. (It's worth noting that a statistically random sample would work just as well, with the additional benefit of encouraging gravitas in the selected voters, but explaining statstics to the general public may be a challenge in itself.)<p>Also, while you may be right, I wouldn't jump too quickly to the conclusion that the best way to solve a problem with an important issue (governance) is to make it unimportant. Certainly one may try to reduce the government's power, but that is orthogonal to the issue of making sure elections are well run.",1320966623

They believe themselves entitled to own $20 million apartments and will do whatever it takes to get them, but they don't pretend to be anything other than what they are. Startup/tech scumbags (because they're more accountable; Zynga's behavior would be unremarkable coming from Goldman) tend to be a bit better at disguising their intentions. They also tend to care more about power, social access and kingmaking, whereas finance scumbags are purely about money. In my opinion, that makes finance scumbags more respectable (or, I should say, less repulsive).<p>That said, I like technology a lot better. There are always going to be scumbags when there's money, but the difference (IME) is that: (1) there are more normal (non-scumbag) people in tech, probably 85% vs. 70%, (2) the normal people in tech are more interesting and creative, whereas decent people in finance tend to be boring, 9-to-5 types, and (3) technology has a small but sizable number of people who are decent and have entered the upper ranks, whereas there's a glass ceiling that non-scumbags experience in finance (unless they start their own trading firms).<p>I didn't move from finance to technology with the illusion that I'd never have to deal with another asshat. I moved because in technology, it's much more likely that <i>I</i> can succeed (a) in a creative way, and (b) without becoming a scumbag myself.",1320966300

8502195,comment,8501194,8501287,0,0,Pxtl,,,"I tend to think Gamergate was a brewing culture war that was just looking for a spark to start the fire.  Gamer culture has had a persecution complex for well over a generation, particularly with respect to the press - even the gaming press.  Being repeatedly insulted and attacked by the media has made them circle their wagons instinctively.  Combined with a substantial fraction of gamers that are <i>intensely</i> misogynistic and this ugliness was practically inevitable.<p>The problem is that gamers picked a fight with SJWs, which are effectively their own mirror image - the same obsessiveness and mean-spirited put-downs and in-group high-fives.  I mean, the fact that the SJWs are <i>right</i> is almost immaterial - in the words of The Big Lebowski: &quot;You&#x27;re not wrong, Walter, you&#x27;re just an asshole&quot;.  Online social justice groups have a knack for utterly alienating and insulting everyone they could ever hope to convince, even those who broadly <i>agree</i> with them.<p>Combine that with Gawker media&#x27;s spectacular ability to stir the pot, and a few prominent right-wing culture-war bloggers feeding the gamer-gaters&#x27; persecution complex, and we&#x27;re seeing outright radicalization.<p>You isolate and insult a guy and then give him an online culture of like-minded outcasts and they start encouraging each other to do <i>drastic</i> things.  There are obvious parallels to other movements of angry young men...<p>It&#x27;s a perfect storm, and it&#x27;s only going to get worse before it gets better since anybody who&#x27;s trying to talk the gamergaters down from the ledge has to have infinite patience for their monomaniacal rationalizations.  They see themselves as the defenders of rationality surrounded by SJWs who fling glib insults... and gaming is founded on endlessly grinding against a pointless task <i>for fun</i>.<p>It&#x27;s profoundly sad to see so many gamers rally behind that gamergate banner.  To see harassment and threats and ruining women&#x27;s lives become the public image of core gamer culture.<p>I&#x27;m really worried that this is going to get worse before it gets better.  The &quot;us vs. them&quot; mentality of the hardcore gamer world is too old and well-established, and everybody else involved is either feeding into it or is drowned out by the din.",1414126084

My high school didn&#x27;t teach computers so I volunteered for the desegregation program to be transferred to a magnet school on math and science that taught on Apple // and IBM PC systems and it was an integrated classroom.<p>I had a friend at the time I got into an argument with, he claimed computers were a fad, going nowhere, and that I should try to become a sports star instead. He said in ten years that Microsoft and Apple would be out of business so there is no reason to learn computer programming. He went for Football and injured his knee and lost his scholarship but remembered the talk we had about computers so he went into learning computer networking and did better.<p>Our high school had an anti bullying policy and zero tolerance on racial slurs. The high school before I transfered was full of bullies and they used racial and homophobic slurs. Picked on me for being a nerd and geek.<p>So yeah it depends on the high school, it also depends on the support of friends. If I had listened to my friend that computers were a fad, I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten to where I went. It was because of his statements that he influenced others not to study computers because he was popular and I was not popular.<p>I find that we need more statistics on these subjects to fully understand them better.<p>But I want to state that white privilege thing, I had a really bad childhood growing up and was picked on and bullied and harassed a lot for being a geek and nerd. Looking for a job was tough as well, I had to do temporary light industrial jobs and work in fast food even with a computer science degree until I was able to earn minimum wage at a computer shop building computers and then it lead to another job as data entry which led to another job in programming. I never had it easy, and even had times I went without a job and looking for whatever I could find.<p>Diversity is a good thing, and I&#x27;ll tell you why. People of diverse backgrounds have different ways of observing things and figuring things out and might notice something someone else might not notice. It might be a product or service has a flaw in it that gets noticed before it ships, it might be they make an improvement on it. If a business discriminates against people they are really setting themselves up for failure by hiring all of the same group of a type of people.<p>But my story, I worked so hard I got a stroke in 2001 and ended up on disability in 2003. Trying to recover from that, but once you are disabled, nobody takes you seriously anymore. I assume my career is over? Nobody seems to be there for us who have a mental illness, esp when we developed it in the line of duty.",1414124981

For example, for months, gcc wouldn&#x27;t compile on Yosemite, and all packages that depend on it (as there&#x27;s no version on dependencies, it assumes it requires the latest), even if it&#x27;s pinned, they still start installing the latest version! Compiling some packages takes hours on MacBook Air. Also, many binaries are hosted on SourceForge, and even upgrading to a point release requires a pull request that needs to be reviewed and approved! I&#x27;ve been waiting weeks to have Terraform upgraded, and I gave up and install all HashiCorp tools myself, not using Homeblew. That&#x27;s why, I think, it just doesn&#x27;t make sense in the world of Linux as it doesn&#x27;t really have a true version and dependency management, it doesn&#x27;t have things like virtual packages, and other basics, but I&#x27;m sure many people who are not comfortable on Linux, but are familiar with OS X and Homebrew, will use it on Linux.

When I went to UM Rolla in 1986 there were very few women in my computer science classes, and for some reason they were most likely to drop out of college before freshman year or change to a different university or different major.<p>I asked and I was told that the classes were designed for males to learn, but not for females to learn. That because of this women and girls had a harder time to learn math and science because the books were written by men and not women and thus were sexist. That I am only a programmer because I have this male privilege?<p>I really don&#x27;t know what to say about that, I always thought males and females had the same potential to learn, and never thought of any book I read or class I took as sexist towards women and girls.<p>But now more and more women are taking arts degrees instead of science and majoring in women&#x27;s studies, politics, communications, and other areas.<p>Just because they don&#x27;t study computer science does not mean they aren&#x27;t smart, just smart in other areas. They never developed an interest in learning how to code and I don&#x27;t know why.",1414123540

And they need to be called on it, because otherwise they keep on doing it. I&#x27;m so tired of this manufactured outrage.<p>I have the same feelings but about other online communities, for example certain sports fan communities. It also applies to serious political issues, such as the hatred of certain politicians or viewpoints -- arguably these issues legitimately would get strong responses but really we all know what most of it is, as you said very well:<p>Manufactured outrage.<p>I&#x27;ve seen otherwise intelligent people I know get swept up in it. It&#x27;s a danger to our society and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m exaggerating. The same online brush-fire that rages against women in gaming today will rage for war, ethnic hatred, or other catastrophes tomorrow. Cynical leaders will manipulate it (and these people are easily manipulated).<p>It also ruins people&#x27;s lives. Every victim of it that I&#x27;ve seen talk about it in retrospect, even public figures or those who played it cool at the time, has talked about how traumatizing it was.",1414123418

Sugar produced from the digestive process goes straight to your bloodstream as glucose if your body needs it, but if you already have enough ... it is sent to your liver where it is converted to glycogen. The rub is, your liver can only store so much glycogen (about 100mg of it I think), after that ... any sugar that hits your liver is converted to straight fat.",1414123232

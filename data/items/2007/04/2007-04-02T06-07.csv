8143,comment,8060,8072,0,0,zaidf,,,"Yeah the methodology I use to decide between Auth.net and PayPal is if the stuff I am doing is for part-time or longhaul. For parttime thing PayPal or some 3rd party is cool. <p>But for longhaul, you might as well spend the extra week and learn the art that you will eventually have to. And dealing with merchant account is indeed an art and study of its own.<p>Another thing - when you have an intermediary like PayPal you are more at risk at your money being frozen for some stupid reason, This can happen with merchant account too but never as often as I have come across torturous PayPal or 2checkout stories.

8142,comment,6668,8068,0,0,DanielH,,,"Well it's not that hard... Normally smart people don't realize that they are smart because they have higher standards and often if they reached those they set them even higher. So from their perspective they normaly never reach their own standards. The problem is that smartness and self-confidence often seem to be diametrically opposed.<p>The point is: Don't hesitate too much and learn to deal with your doubts (especially if you start a startup :o)).",1175494237

You absolutely do not have to tell them ahead of time, ""by signing up, you may have to switch billing systems by the end of summer"" in the sign-up application.  There is no need.<p>Instead, just mass e-mail them the link and directions to do so when the need comes (if ever.)  People are used to typing in their name, address, and e-mail into forms.<p>Remember, the second time around, you are no longer asking a new customer to commit to you.  Your customers already know you and your service, so 100% of them will gladly follow simple directions to update their address information.  Trust me.<p>I would spend the extra few days working on the main product or service instead, until you need to use the more complex shopping cart.<p>Please let me know what you think!",1175493945

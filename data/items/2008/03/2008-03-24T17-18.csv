Not politics or philosophy.  If you are a refined listener, then you are aware of these things on at least a subconscious level.  I also hate it when artists and musicians spout muzzy-headed nonsense.  But there are others who have had their awareness informed by what they practice.

That is why they don't realize that there are other majors out there that work their asses off.  I know a couple of theater majors who, while my engineering roommates and I are tailgating, are spending the entire morning working on a show or are actually in class on a saturday morning.<p>In response to point 2, it seems like a lot of engineering grades are basically arbitrary.  Usually the average ends up being between 55-70, so the professor just has to set some sort of curve, which they can put wherever - they are, however, generally less forgiving when doing so.<p>To point #1 Last semester, I had to make up an idea and design an interface from scratch.  Right now, one of my roommates is working on hypothesis testing for a tetris AI system, one is working on creating his own just in time compiler, and there's a number of other projects going on at any given time.  This article seriously sounds like it was written by a 19 year old sophomore that hasn't yet gotten over the bitterness/arrogance of being in a really challenging field and hasn't even tried to find something to do in college other than his homework.  You can be an engineer and enjoy yourself, both academically and socially, it just takes a little bit of |oh no| <i>creativity</i>.",1206380910

I'm just going to have to address each point:<p>Point #5:  Some textbooks are indeed awful.  This is probably the most reasonable point here.  But I don't think this is specific to engineering.  And it's possible to learn the material in different ways, thanks to the net.<p>Point #4:  I don't think it is a professor's job to 'create excitement'.  I'm happy with a professor when they do a great job explaining things, not when they sound like a Pontiac (""we build excitement"") ad.<p>Point #3: This stands out as particularly awful.  Engineering programs don't exist to hold students' hands while they search for work.<p>Point #2:  This point manages to be arrogant and incorrect at the same time.  In my experience, the brightest students are often the ones with the best grades.  Yes, some obviously talented students will slack, but the author is totally over-generalizing.<p>Point #1:  Every assignment feels the same.  He makes this statement, and then fails to back it up.  Yes, many assignments were based on math.  This does not make them the same.

Supposedly, the genes humans have are in aggregate woefully ill-suited for success in modernity, at least this is what I hear from people who make similar arguments relating to evolutionary psychology. Programming computers post dates by at least 100K years the environment in which our genes were supposedly selected for reproductive success. On theory, everyone of us ought to be clumsy at best around computers, tho the evidence is all to the contrary.<p>Even granting your evolutionary premise tho, it has some problems. For one, I think you overlook a number of notably spectacular successes in eusocial species where size matters. Instead of lions in Africa, for instance, spend some time observing an ant mound. I also wouldn't expect that reproductive success and professional success would necessarily track each other. Or maybe I misunderstood you.<p>My $0.02: I think fulfillment of the individual and the success of the organization is more the result of the nature and motivations of the actual individuals involved with it than, per se, the size of the organization.

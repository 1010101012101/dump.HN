5848394,comment,5847483,5848339,2,0,einhverfr,,,"The problem is that standards of government, education, and so forth are cultural standards, and when one says everyone should have the equal opportunity, then there is no opportunity for the Amish or other more traditional groups.  Additionally if you think as many do that if you call something &quot;child abuse&quot; that it impacts potential for many years of life, that impacts things too.  So I don&#x27;t think you can separate off standards of morality.  These are deeply connected to economic and social realities and the interplay between moral standards and economic opportunity goes both ways.  For example, think about this:  why do we regard abortion as a right?  Is it tied to the realities women face in our economy?  Or were hunter gatherers who did not have access to abortion violating human rights?  I don&#x27;t think the second viewpoint is remotely defensible, so it must be the first.<p>> That said, I don&#x27;t for a second believe that there&#x27;s any reason for us to accept that all cultures are worth saving, or that some cultural norms should not be actively fought.<p>The question is who has the right to fight them and how.  It&#x27;s one thing to critique another culture.  It&#x27;s something else to go out to try to force <i>them</i> to see the error of <i>their</i> ways.  The problem is that the latter is usually just an exercise of nationalism if we define nationalism as hating other national/cultural groups.<p>The question is, how sure should an outsider be of the context of an action?  Or is this better left for the members of the culture to navigate and evolve as meets their needs?  I side generally with the latter unless it involves conflict between cultural groups.  That&#x27;s different and poses different problems.",1370775449

That said, here&#x27;s some analysis of his sources:<p>Most of the articles he (doesn&#x27;t) link to are about harmful effects of beta-carotene and vitamin A, which coincidentally turn out to be mostly the same thing, just in a different form. Checking out the one article I found [1], they gave 30mg of beta-carotene (16K UI), and 25000 UI of retinyl palmitate, which converts to a total of 41000UI of vitamin-A, or 800% of the recommended daily dosage.<p>That dosage is <i>insanely</i> high. I have a very good &quot;mega multi&quot; vitamin, and it only contains 200% of vitamin-A, because it is well known that vitamin A and vitamin D are one of the few vitamins that are actually harmful at large doses, and you can get poisoned/die from overdoses. It&#x27;s the reason why you don&#x27;t want to eat polar bear livers. To OD on vitamin A is quite easy, with effects being seen starting at daily 21000 UI doses. So no multivitamin pills actually contain that high of an amount of vitamin A. I find it strange that he&#x27;s not talking about specific brands, probably because none of them contain the high amounts that are used in the articles he talks about.<p>It doesn&#x27;t surprise me that taking 41000 UI has adverse effects, since it&#x27;s known that this is already well over OD limits, and is especially risky for smokers, who have a lower OD limit.<p>All in all, the reasons he puts forward why mega doses are bad, are not relevant to consumer vitamin pills because the doses are not in the same ballpark. I would also like to see the amount of lives saved because of the pills - much like airbags and car belts, there might be people who die from using them especially, but there might be many more people saved as well, turning it into a net profit.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15572756"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15572756</a>",1370773405

Differences lead to disagreement and conflict. Privacy, amongst other things, gives everyone a means to shield their differences; be it something legal that society disapproves of, or something illegal that everyone does anyway, or something that&#x27;s illegal in other cultures, or just odd. It&#x27;s a necessary part of living in this world without either spending our time killing each other, or ending up a bland monoculture in which nobody ever steps outside the lines of society&#x27;s accepted behaviour.",1370772675

5848297,comment,5847330,5847799,5,0,slacka,,,"Thanks for the link. Some great points there like:<p>* Since 9/11 we have not had a mass-scale terror attack. We can say 9/11 was a one-off, an aberration, and cannot be a justification for everything the government wishes to do.<p>* If domestic spying is for our own good, the government should be proud to tell us what they are doing for us, instead of being embarrassed when it leaks. If you&#x27;re not doing anything wrong then you&#x27;ve got nothing to hide, right?<p>* The system completely missed the Boston bombers, two of the dumbest, least sophisticated bro&#x27; terrorists in the world.<p>* If instead of spending trillions and trillions of dollars on spying and domestic surveillance we spent that same money on repairing our infrastructure and improving our schools, wouldn&#x27;t that more directly create a stronger America?<p>All are valid points to consider in this discussion. But for me, it all boils down to the risk terrorist pose to America vs risk of government abusing its power. No contest. I&#x27;ll take my chances with the &quot;terrorists&quot; any time, any place, any day.<p>Let us not forget the sacrifice made by our founding fathers to give us liberty. Our freedom came at great price that shouldn&#x27;t be taking lightly. Only after an open national discussion, with the consensus necessary for a constitutional amendment, should the government be given this power over us that they are taking now in secret.",1370772548

The issue with that, of course, is that they won&#x27;t vote out of office the officials responsible for allowing these programs.  Every elected official involved in the oversight of these programs, those that announce support for them, and those that do not publicly denounce them, must be voted out in the next election.  That won&#x27;t happen because of people like this.  As a democratic society, ambivalence may be the most dangerous enemy we face.<p>It would be interesting to see what would happen if the NSA offered free, nationwide, unlimited mobile voice/LTE data/SMS with a warning that all of it would be monitored and recorded.  My bet is the adoption rate would be above 90%.",1370772513

The fact is that it&#x27;s a constant battle against the ambitious and power-hungry people that drive governments towards totalitarianism.  To smugly throw up your arms and say it&#x27;s the people&#x27;s fault is to give a free pass the actual evildoersthe actual people who are sitting in backrooms selling out our freedom and liberty in order to get more control and leverage for who knows what purposes.

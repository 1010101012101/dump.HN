So even if electromagnetic fields as emitted by laptops were a threat, it would only protect your testicles, rather than, say, internal organs, bone marrow, your brain or your eyes.

A subclass is usually (not always!) a subtype, not the other way round. Or, more specifically (and accurately), most statically-typed class-based OO languages treat subclasses in their type systems as subtypes by default, i.e., they assume that a subclass instance can act as an instance of its superclass, LSP-wise. This, I believe, is as accurate statement as one can make (on this level of generality).<p><i>The is-a relationship is saying for all instances I of X, I is an instance of Y which is essentially the definition of superset.

Therefore the compiler can be much more aggressive about unrolling loops and changing the order of operations.<p>By contrast, given a loop like<p><pre><code>  for( i=0; i<N; ++i ) {\n    y[i] = 2*x[i];\n    }\n</code></pre>\na C compiler has to assume that y[i] might be the same memory location as x[i+1], for example.  Thus it has to ensure that the load into y[i] is complete before accessing x[i].<p>This is one reason you see a lot of C code that does numerical work hand-unrolled, with explicit stores, like this:<p><pre><code>  for( i=0; i<N; i+=4 ) {\n    xi = x[i];\n    xip1 = x[i+1]; xip2 = x[i+2]; xip3 = x[i+3];\n    y[i] = 2*xi; ... y[i+3] = 2*xip3;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nNow that C provides the ""restrict"" keyword, a smart C compiler can do many of the same optimization tricks that Fortran has had since day 1.",1367689180

Many people have said this, and I'm thinking about an alternative.<p>> Or phrased differently, why would I ever not want to use the ""URL Template Shorthands"" approach mentioned later?<p>You can think of the ID-based approach as just coming with a set of default URL templates in a top-level rel. The primary reason I included it (and I considered not including it), is that it may be easier for servers, when getting started, to adhere to both strict URL naming and skip generating URLs in the JSON serialization layer of their application. I'm working on some tooling for Rails that will pretty much eliminate these considerations, but I weighed ease of server-implementation when I built this. Again, don't think of the ID form as being URL-less, think of it as coming with a default, easy to implement URL template.<p>> Why use application/json and not something more specific? I can see some reasons, but would be interested in yours.<p>Two reasons: (1) Many existing clients and servers already support easy generation of JSON requests and JSON responses. (2) I haven't yet registered an alternative MIME type.<p>> On creation, if I accept the pain of generating an ID on the client and can construct the URI using the template, why can't I use PUT instead of POST?<p>Good point. That seems fine.<p>> If I use a POST to create something, why don't I get a 201 Created with a Location header?<p>Also good point, and an embarrassing oversight on my part. That should be how it works.<p>> I'd suggest to upgrade the ""MAY"" for caching to a ""SHOULD"".<p>Hmm. You think a server <i>SHOULD</i> use HTTP caching? RFC terminology is pretty dodgy, but caching really seems more like an optional feature (""One vendor may choose to include the item because a particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item"") than a strong recommendation (""This word, or the adjective ""RECOMMENDED"", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course"").<p>Thanks for all the feedback.

One example is spending money on political lobbying in order to be given a share of wealth that has already been created.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking</a><p>A black market - almost by definition - is one in which the players are cut off from the channels of official lobbying or patronage that make rent-seeking a viable economic strategy.<p>That's not to say that a dark symbiosis can't develop between black marketeers and legitimate authorities. For instance, the police, by enforcing laws against drug trafficking, increase the risks of trafficking. This increases prices and profits alike. High profits attract a constant supply of traffickers, who also tend to be far more ruthless than the average businessman, which brings additional layers of criminality to the trade, thereby ensuring continued employment for the police - to say nothing of an unsettling expansion of their powers.<p>But at no point do the traffickers and the police feel a mutual need to formalize this relationship, since public opinion remains, on balance, opposed to the narcotics trade. That is to say, the police can rely on the ballot box to stay employed, stripping them of any incentive to do business (at least on an open, institutional level) with traffickers. Meanwhile, the traffickers can count on public opinion to keep police on the beat, and need not go to any further expense to keep their racket going.<p>Contrast all this with the retroactive extension of copyright terms which has got to be the canonical example of true rent seeking, illuminating the practice in its most naked and unproductive form.<p>EDIT: An more germane example is the lobbying done by pharmaceutical companies with an interest in keeping the law and public opinion in opposition to illegal substances that may have pharmacological properties. Because these substances are too well known to be patented, their legalization could lead to patent-free formulations that reduce demand for patentable substitutes that pharmaceutical companies have created, or ones they could develop in future. Blocking the legal use of one widely and cheaply available substance to create a market for a more expensive but conceivably inferior alternate is a text-book case of rent seeking.",1367688352

The kind of caching described in JSON API allows an application to group together requests for documents while avoiding making requests for documents it already has. The only way HTTP caching works is if every request for a document is 1:1 with an HTTP request, which doesn't map onto my experience (and our experience with Ember Data) at all.<p>> I see you have an application specific need for a certain thing but I don't think it generalises enough.<p>This functionality was extracted out of a general purpose framework used by a number of applications that made heavy use of it. The ability to send a normalized graph of objects in a single payload, and then make a small number of additional requests, only for the documents that the client doesn't already have, is a huge win for clients working with a non-trivial number of related objects.<p>The rest of your concerns are very valid. FWIW, I envision future extensions being added to the `meta` section, which is already reserved. ID, URL, and rel are the building blocks of the graph, while other kinds of extensions (like pagination, etc.) are optional metadata.

It's NPR-liberal, not fun loving socially open liberal, and <i>definitely</i> not San Francisco liberal. It's ideologically liberal but not culturally so.<p>It took me a year or two to wrap my mind around it as it's a sort of conservatism you just don't find elsewhere in the U.S. much. It took me aback. I had no conceptual framework to place it in. Eventually I realized it was an upper-crust blue blooded Ivy League thing, a bizarre hybrid where people are intellectually open minded but socially unbelievably reserved.<p>(2) Boston is a <i>huge</i> college town, and thus has a very transient population. People move there for school or work for a while, but they often do not settle there. Why make lasting friendships when everyone's just going to leave? Also: the social scene tends to revolve around the schools to a great extent. If you're a student you have those social networks, but there is less of a social scene for non-students.<p>(3) It's expensive and inconvenient to drive in Boston, and the public transit is unfriendly to socialization. The T stops running at 12:30AM, and cabs are insanely expensive-- far more costly than New York. So people don't want to go out further than they can walk or commute in a <i>short</i> cab ride. Go out to some place like North Cambridge or Quincy and you're looking at a $40+ cab ride home. I think this is a <i>huge</i> reason there is no quality club/music scene to speak of outside a few tiny islands here and there.<p>All that being said, people are very polite and friendly. It's not that people are hostile or mean, just that they don't socialize much and keep to themselves. I think it's a vicious cycle too-- it drives people away who would otherwise really like to live there. Boston is a wonderful city in many, many ways.",1367687977

We had a sponsor who wanted to build a marketplace for tourism operators and B&Bs. I was the only real developer on the team of 4.

7603035,comment,7602740,7602740,12,0,michaelochurch,,,"Here&#x27;s another factor: <i>extreme price inelasticity</i>. We saw inelasticity in the 1970s oil shocks. Supply was only reduced by about 5%, but that caused 4x price surges, putting elasticity (E) at:<p><pre><code>    -ln(0.95) / ln(4) = 0.037\n</code></pre>\nIf E < 1, then reducing the quantity supplied by X% will increase prices by more than X%, with no other change to the innate desirability (demand curve) of it. With housing, E << 1. It&#x27;s probably in the same range as oil: 0.02 to 0.04. This means that things can simultaneously destroy value, but drive up prices enough to increase the value of the total stock.<p>Let&#x27;s say that an earthquake hits Manhattan or San Francisco, destroying 5% of all housing. Ignore the (highly unpredictable) short-term effect on prices; there will probably be deals in the immediate aftermath due to panic selling. Assume zero effect on the local job market (that&#x27;s not true, but it&#x27;s actually close enough that it won&#x27;t affect the conclusion). Six months out, rents (and, although not by as much, property prices) will be <i>much higher</i> because of the reduced supply. Let&#x27;s say that prices double. Wealth was destroyed. It&#x27;s unambiguously a bad, value-destroying, thing when 5% of the housing stock falls into ruin. However, the bulk price of the total housing stock has gone up by 90%.<p>That&#x27;s what 95% of these housing pundits don&#x27;t get. They look at a spiking housing market and think, &quot;Wow, people really want to live here, this place is doing well.&quot; They think that increasing desirability (local job market) is the primary cause of the housing price increase, and that the NIMBY corruption is just a supporting actor, and it&#x27;s not so. At one time, Luanda was the most expensive city in terms of real estate. Angola is not a wealthy country (GDP per capita around $7,000) and it&#x27;s consistently in the bottom fourth for the HDI. Moscow sometimes edges out New York and San Francisco for real estate prices, and neither weather nor the job market explain that.<p>Half a century ago, NIMBYism was more explicitly racist than 2014-style classism and it did immense damage to American cities. Just ask Detroit, Baltimore, Newark, or even Pittsburgh. NIMBY policies benefit a small number of wealth-destroying rentiers, but inelasticity makes a system more brittle. It means that price impulses magnify (rather than dampening) and cause undesirable feedback effect. The term &quot;shock&quot; is accurate, and it can bring a city to its knees in a short amount of time.",1397735881
7603034,comment,7602617,7602617,3,0,noelwelsh,,,"The problem is, simplicity is not an objective measure. Take monads, for example. To most developers these are a foreign and possibly scary concept. Once you understand them, however, they seem ridiculously simple. This is one of the problems with monad tutorials -- they are so simple there is almost nothing there. I know I spent a long time trying to find a &quot;deep&quot; concept when learning monads, before I realised there isn&#x27;t one.<p>Building a system with monads, if you understand them, is simple. You can write together components easily, and have concurrency, logging, error handling and more all nicely abstracted away. But is this a simple system?

The same can be said about a lot of &quot;old&quot; technologies, and certainly about almost every industry standard out there.<p>On the other hand, once in a while the Alice/Albert bet happens to win; be it because the new system is really better (as in: easy to maintain, or really being capable of managing higher amounts of workload), for non-technological reasons (Alice/Albert just happen to have a great idea), or just because of luck.

Until there is some revolutionary new tool for generating a human-understandable narrated history of large-scale design decisions from a source control history, your time will almost certainly be better spent reading textbooks that incrementally develop a piece of software over several chapters. Even that is cheating -- the authors know exactly where they want to end up and they won&#x27;t include all the missteps they made when they first started writing similar programs. But it&#x27;s still loads better than the alternative. Just as sitting in a law school library absorbing an encyclopedic knowledge of the law won&#x27;t really train you to make arguments that will fly in front of a judge, reading a code base as a dead, unchanging document won&#x27;t teach you what it is to live in that code.",1397733287

We (our atoms) become entangled with those particles, we become superposition. It&#x27;s just propagation of entangled state.<p>Why we don&#x27;t perceive ourselves as in superposition? &quot;It turns out that this result generalizes to any number of mutually entangled particles. If we ignore any one particle, the entropy diagram of the remaining particles looks like a system of N-1 particles in a classically correlated state with a non-zero entropy.&quot;. That means each atom of our bodies <i>perceives</i> other atoms entangled with it as they were not in any superposition (though as a whole, the system is still in superposition). We (atoms) are constantly entangled and in superposition with our environment, but we perceive it as classical state.<p>In what state each atom &quot;sees&quot; every other? According to probability. That&#x27;s why in double slit experiment  we see only <i>one</i> of most probable outcomes, not a random one.<p>Time could be rate of entanglement propagation. Entanglement propagates with speed of light (speed of particles), so we seem live in same timeline. But if something moves away from us with speed of light, the time for this object goes slower, but only relative to us.<p>Until two particles interact with any way, they live in totally different timelines. After they &quot;observe&quot; each other (entangle with each other), also their <i>time</i> becomes entangled. That&#x27;s why after we see a cup begin dropped, it becomes part of our reality, and the cup becomes broken in our time.<p>We live in <i>spacetime</i>. As mentioned in article &quot;“Spooky action at a distance” ought to be no more and no less) mysterious than the “spooky action across time” which makes the universe consistent with itself from one moment to the next.&quot;.<p>Why arrow of time? The article says: &quot;Under QIT, a measurement is just the propagation of a mutually entangled state to a large number of particles. To reverse this process we would have to &quot;disentagngle&quot; these quantum states. In principle this is possible. In practice it is not.&quot;. I think differently though.<p>That are my thoughts. Please don&#x27;t judge :)",1397732857

Twenty years ago they were appropriate, but now we have YouTube and PDF files and Print-On-Demand. These technologies means that universities don't have to employ lackluster lecturers, but can instead create highly-crafted lecture videos (in the style of Khan Academy) and comprehensive lecture notes. Certainly these materials will cost a lot to produce, but they can be used year after year, with only minor corrections for the changing course syllabus.<p>If a university would create proper learning materials and drop the lectures, there would be a lot more time to have more discussion-based and hands-on learning.",1307753628

The reason for the breakage is in the green circles, not the red ones: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/EYSo5.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/EYSo5.jpg</a><p>The 2007 cables had small buttons on the sides that you had to press to disengage the connector from the device. This meant you had to pull on the body of the connector to remove it. The 2009 design removes the buttons and the catches, which means the plug can be removed by yanking on the cable. It's the yanking on the cable that is causing the problem in the image, you can tell because the wire sleeve is pulled back from the connecter rather than split horizontally, which is what would happen if it was a strain relief issue.
Yanking from the cable rather than the connector affects all cables. Apple connectors typically fit very snugly in their sockets (which is a good thing generally) which means it takes more force to pull them out, consequently pulling out the wires as well. It's not a problem unique to Apple by any means. Ever have a pair of headphones that start to crackle when you touch the connector? Same problem.<p>Apple cords do indeed have strain relief, and they are fine for typical use. They may not hold up as well as a longer relief when bent at high angles consistently, but generally they do the job they need to do when sticking out the side of a device.<p>Though I like the button design, if I were to guess why Apple removed the buttons, is because I'll bet people were still pulling on the cords to try to remove the connector and doing far worse damage to cord and/or socket due to the mechanical connection between the two.",1307751957

2642869,comment,2640756,2642626,3,0,code_duck,,,"What I see as the big strength is how easy it is to set up mod_php - possibly in no small part due to how most Linux distributions have solid defaults for mod_php5 and keep it up to date. The things you listed I'm not so sure about.<p>I don't think it's the syntax that's forgiving as much as the type coercion.  JavaScript is actually more forgiving syntax wise, for example - PHP throws a fatal error when a semicolon is missing at the end of a line, JS interpreters fill it in. Unlike PHP, though it will throw a ReferenceError and die upon referencing any undefined value. PHP just coerces that to something falsey... they'll both die trying to call undefined functions or methods.<p>I don't see how PHP is not more readable than Python or Ruby, either. There's really nothing about the language itself that makes it readable or better for beginners.<p>The docs are definitely good, I agree. I think they need to do something about the outdated and not-so-well curated comments on each entry though.<p>Near ubiquity is good, but it also makes a lot of good PHP resources get lost in horrible noise. WordPress, for instance - if you search to solve anything, you find scores of outdated tutorials offering solutions to problems which have been solved by the official branch for years. Then, you find more blogs blog-spamming the incorrect solution... so it's actually easier to search for and find Rails or Django help, in my experience. A large percentage of the PHP code out there is notably terrible, for whatever reasons.<p>The 'interpolation' would be called templating. You can do this in most languages (erb for Ruby, for example) but it's not always considered a good idea to give the template language logic capabilities. It happens that this is the default for how PHP and Apache work together, and I think the straightforward concepts of files, directories, scripts it's easier for beginners to understand and work with than framework style URL routing.<p>The large software eco-system centered around tools <i>consumers</i> use such as WordPress or joomla has helped PHP grow.<p>Set up is easy, but the majority of PHP users probably never set up their own Linux boxes with Apache anyhow. If they wanted to, though it would be easier than say, Django since last I checked Ubuntu was still providing Django .96 packages.<p>The ease of setup comes from every shared host offering PHP and MySQL. If they all offered Python, Django and Postgres support, with cpanel configs and PhpPgAdmin or the like, people would magically find Django really easy to set up. That's just how it goes when you have lots of market share.",1307751691

The only difference is I don't have 3G service or 100mb free with it. But it runs Chrome slowly, loses WIFI a lot, has a terrible trackpad, and hangs any time I look at any page with Flash on it.<p>There is honestly something to be said for an iPad without Flash. I keep trying to convince myself that I want a lightweight laptop instead, but everything I've tried is a letdown. I'm glad I saved my $500.",1307751344

Your opinion is very important to me, and I appreciate the opportunity to respond to you on this important issue.<p>The PROTECT IP Act will prohibit foreign websites, formerly operating outside the realm of U.S. law, from exploiting U.S. Internet service providers, payment processors, search engines, and ad placement services.<p>From enrolling in classes to communicating with our loved ones, the Internet can be a critical medium in the daily lives of Americans.  The Internet was created to be a venue for sharing information, and we must continue to make certain that consumers can access that content without discrimination.<p>However, the expansion of the Internet has also created more opportunities for copyright infringement.  Illegal downloads have been cited as one of the main causes for the decline in the music industry.  As new mediums of communication develop, it is imperative to discuss how to best protect privacy rights and intellectual property.  Rest assured that I will work with my colleagues in the Senate to best address this explosion of Internet content and issues that come with it, and ensure that intellectual property rights are protected while being mindful of those who access that content.",1307751148

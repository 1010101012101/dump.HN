My skill set is very close to what you seek, and I'd love to meet you and talk about possibilities some day, but for the time being I'm completely consumed by my own startup.<p>When you say ""the upcoming YC round"", do you mean 4/02/08?  If so, I imagine that you'd be better off applying as a single founder.  Probably not a good idea to go into business with someone you've only known for 8 days.  As a single founder myself, I'd need at least 6 months to a year to get to know someone and work with them before I'd make a commitment.  Better yet, I'd prefer someone I've known for years, but the dozen or so possibilities always seem to have some other road block.<p>Is there anyone you already know and have worked with before that could join you?  That way, your odds would be much better (for YC and beyond).<p>Good luck and keep us posted.",1206456702

145711,comment,145655,145655,0,0,iamwil,,,"This is rather neat, though the actual paper is less breathless than the wired article.  I skimmed through it, and here's what I got:<p>The algorithm assumes face images have been cropped and normalized, and only has been run on frontal views.  Pose variation, detection, and alignment aren't handled by this algorithm--claimed to be a different problem.  But it does handle different illumination and expressions, as well as occlusion and noise.<p>According to No-free-lunch theorem, there is no generalized classifier that performs better than any other classifier on all classification tasks.  Therefore, in any classification task, the solution is often tailored towards the problem, and picking features is one way to tailor it.  Often times, you can't use all the features available to you, because they could be noisy or using them all can be computationally expensive.  This is why people use SVD, PCA, or other techniques to filter out features that affect the classification the least, so you only do classification on features that affect classification the most.<p>That's why people use some heuristics like picking eyes, mouth, noses as features, as it would seem like that's where most of the information is.<p>The weird thing being claimed here is that it actually doesn't matter which features you pick as long as 1) feature space is huge 2) you pick enough features 3) you use a ""correct"" sparse representation of the features<p>Apparently, they do recognition by trying to represent the new face as a linear combination of all known faces in the database.  So if the new face belongs to a person in the database, it can be represented mostly by faces in the database known to belong to one person.  If the new face belongs to someone not in the database, then we can only represent it as a combination of different peoples' faces in our database.<p>In order for the surveillance mentioned in Wired to work, you'd still need to have an annotated database of people's faces built from somewhere.  Same with auto-tagging people's photos on facebook.  And you'd need more than one photo of a person too.<p>However, given Louis Van Ahn's method of using games to entice people to do recognition tasks, and facebook tagging, you can create database of people's faces fairly easily.",1206456284

145700,comment,145417,145417,0,0,nostrademons,,,"> for every goal you put in front of someone, you should also put in place a counter-goal to restrict gaming of the first goal<p>There's a particular perverse incentive that comes from the <i>lack</i> of equity compensation combined with restrictive legal covenants.  If an employee works at a company where their only compensation is cash and yet they're under restrictive IP or no-solicitation agreements, their incentive is to...destroy the company.   Think about it: the primary benefit they get from working at the company is in learning the business practices and meeting lots of smart people, but they can't use that resource as long as their old employer exists, because of their legal agreements.  So it is to their advantage to drive their employer into bankruptcy, because this frees them from their legal agreements (which are with now-defunct entity) and yet they have nothing to lose.<p>As I understand it, a compensation scheme like this is actually used in many financial firms.  Employees are given large performance-based cash bonuses, but also have to sign no-solicit agreements that prevent them from running away with coworkers or customers and opening their own fund.  Perhaps this is behind the unusual number of financial firms that get taken down by a single rogue trader or group of traders, eg. Salomon Brothers, Barings Bank, Bear Stearns.<p>The employees don't even have to consciously think ""I'm going to destroy the company.""  More likely, they're thinking ""I'm going to make this enormous bet with company money, and if it pays off, I get to pocket half a billion dollars.  If it doesn't, the company goes down and I can start my own hedge fund.""",1206455637
145699,story,,,5,8,nilobject,"Ask YC: For the love, or the money?",,"In my spare time, I've been working on a product that has a fair amount of interest around it. I have no doubt that once I get the product finished, the company will be successful and profitable. I see some market opportunities that is making me want to push harder and get done sooner, but with a day job paying my bills, I can only move so fast.<p>Thus, I think to myself, how about getting an investor or a loan? Loans are pretty much out of the option, as far as I can tell, because I don't have enough assets personally (and if I did, I wouldn't need one!). And when looking at investors, it appears that most of them look for some ""big money"" event.<p>But that's the conflict of interest, I suppose. I have no problems making money, but I'm not doing this startup because I want to make a ton of money going public or being acquired. I'm doing the startup because it's something I love, and something I want to be able to use myself.<p>Inevitably, I resign myself to the double life of my day job and my passion. So the question to everyone here is: what's a guy like me to do? Are there options that would allow me to dedicate my entire life to this that I haven't considered and won't make me feel like I'm selling out?",1206455556

I was living in my office and had no salary (expenses covered, nothing more), a tough schedule (mornings & evenings needed to get back in touch w/ N. America), my first experience in management (6 staff or so),  and had almost zero encouragement from my partners, because our expenses only increased with time as we realized what we were <i>really</i> getting in to (China is not exactly WYSIWYG when it comes to business) -- and I had no contact with the main decision-maker, who was the only person with any real experience in what we were doing (for political reasons I had to go through founder #2 to get to founder-investor#1).<p>I was literally stressed out of my mind. I lost a good portion of my short-term memory (until I quit). I could no longer predict what I was able to do in the future -- no ability to manage my own commitments & performance. Forgot why I wanted to live. Took up smoking.<p>I kept going as long as I did because I believed in the value of ""sheer persistence"".

3143820,comment,3140846,3140846,1,0,kermitthehermit,,,"He says that he has tried to run a server with GNOME based on CENTOS and that his updates broke the machine. I didn't have such a problem, but who knows what this guy, who assures us he knows what he speaks of, did?<p>1. Yes, there are some issues with package management on a lot of distributions. These issues aren't as dramatic as this guy is trying to make them seem.<p>THE POINT:
Linux isn't windows, there are a lot of distributions and I am pretty sure a lot of them can handle a LAMP stack properly.<p>2. He complains about CENTOS which he used together with GNOME for a LAMP server. Centos isn't quite the ""go to"" distro when you want everything to just work TM. Yes, it's good enough to be used in a lot of places, but they release updates after redhat has released them and this takes a while; it might also be prone to breaking.
(note: I am using Debian and Ubuntu for everything related to LAMP)<p>THE POINT:
Use Debian, Ubuntu, buy RHEL or buy Ubuntu support for enterprise if you want to have some kind of safety net when doing updates.<p>3. He mentions something broke after an update and GNOME was now broken for him (or something along those lines).
I'd get my brain scanned for tumors asap if I got the idea of running X on a production /development web server running in the data center.<p>THE POINT:
The idea of running X and a desktop environment on a server is a sign that you are looking for trouble. Security issues, wasted resources, more processes, more things to update, more things to check and more things which can crash due to some leak / bug / stray process.<p>4. Going rageish-murdery-suicidal over some issue with a server is a sign you're doing something wrong, with your professional, personal life or both. Maybe a break is required or some more RTFM is needed. If that's not helping, maybe you should try to find another job and stick to it.<p>THE POINT:
Complaining about some problem you most likely have caused makes you look like an idiot, especially if you write an article saying you went back to Megabloat TM Windows.<p>5. Maintaining a LAMP stack web server isn't complicated when you have a ""root server"" in a datacenter with a RAID1 / RAID 10 storage array. It's quite probably the most tested part of most linux distributions.<p>THE POINT:
I've helped linux newbies who can use Ubuntu set up their own webservers by themselves and they complained a lot less about any kind of issues. It's not rocket science.<p>6. He mentioned ""software I had to compile from source"", but he never says anything specific like: ""I had this version of foo-bar-x.y and needed foo-bar-x.y+2 because they fixed this extremely bad exploit, but there was no package for it"". Come on, you want to convince people, right? So why not share some pieces of information about the part which might be the most important and, probably, the cause of the alleged failure?<p>THE POINT:
The article is all too vague all around, chasing around the tail.<p>7. The tone and the splitting of the articles in such a way that there's a ""murdery-suicidal"" subjective section and a fake objective ""after things were done"" section makes me think this was something someone paid to have on the web.
I wouldn't put it past Microsoft to do something like this as they have done far worse things in the past.<p>THE POINT:
Exposing your own failure, real or invented, to try to manipulate people into picking Windows over Linux or some other *NIX for a server makes you look like a total worthless tool.<p>His credentials mean nothing to me after I've seen what kind of articles fueled by personal incompetence and failure turned into rage - provided that's even true.<p>If you search for this article, you will find that it's posted across a lot of websites. I also suspect that it's the zealots who work for zdnet or their sponsors at Microsoft.<p>As of now, zdnet.com and www.zdnet.com are in my hosts file with a well deserved IP: 127.0.0.1.

3143818,comment,3135185,3138623,2,0,dvogel,,,"Your regression tests sound very similar to what I call perl tests. The perl community was ahead of it's time by distributing a test suite with packages on CPAN. Tests that come out of bug fixes tend (at least for me) to be complexity tests. Essentially they are a 2x2 test of the interaction of pairs of conditional paths with some interaction between them. This dovetails nicely with Rich's point -- keep things simple but in those few inevitable areas where complexity will arise, make sure you can reason about them. I just write regression tests around them to ensure that my reasoning about them is correct. Rich skips the tests because he's better at remembering or re-reasoning through them again :)",1319302141

3143812,comment,3140457,3142384,2,0,bermanoid,,,"Yes, I'm familiar with ensemble methods, I use them a lot for classification.  But those are not really what I'm thinking about (I'm still groping towards concrete ideas here, so forgive me if the following is a bit vague).  Perhaps my saying ""the reverse of boosting"" is not really an accurate way to put this, in retrospect, so let me clarify.<p>Ensemble methods typically take several distinct (either by method or training) weak learners and combine the predictions to get one strong hybrid by smoothing, averaging, or otherwise combining the results.  They are still vulnerable to overtraining, though, and they're not very good at generalizing from small amounts of data because the individual weak learners don't learn from each other or from context.<p>My theory is that we might be able to get rid of the ensemble and tolerate massive overtraining without detriment if instead of merely combining results, we took a recursive approach and let the classifier use its output as input at another level.  My thought is that overtraining on some patterns could be mollified by the ability to recognize error due to overtraining as a pattern at a different depth of recursion.<p>This obviously would not be generally applicable to weak learners, it would only apply to a particular subset of learners, and that's where my thoughts get a lot muddier and speculative.<p>My really wild speculation: in the limit, if you set something like this up in the right way, you might be able to come up with an efficient approximation to Solomonoff induction as restricted to the subset of patterns that you're actually exposed to, rather than over the entire set of possible inputs.  If I'm correct about that, it would enable staggeringly effective learning within a domain, as long as the domain itself displayed patterns that had some sort of underlying order.<p>But I don't have any codez to show, or really anything more than a hunch at this point, so don't take me too seriously. :)",1319301863

The price is around $100.<p>I have not done any heavy marketing yet and still improving the software so I am thinking what if I can sell my software at a lower price point, will it attract more users?<p>So I went to this deals website and found through previous testimonials that the best way to gain more if you could price it around $20<p>So cutting the long story, I decided to do the deal promo at 80% discount and the deals website takes 50% of the revenue. So for every sale I make $10.<p>Since the deal was only for a day I thought of experimenting.<p>The deal went live @12 in the midnight. By the morning I woke up, I had 10 orders in my inbox.<p>Since then every hour sent around 2-3 orders.
By the end of the deal time, I ended up with a total of around 30 orders.<p>Now let us crunch the numbers.<p>My total profit on 30 orders = $300<p>My total profit on average on a regular day = $100<p>That seems a good decision right?<p>Let us talk about the support time.<p>It took around 6 hours of my total day time (if you add up all the time) to monitor the deals page for customers asking questions and sending registration codes. Yes there were lots and lots of questions from users and I was readily answering them.<p>so if I value my time at all and put it at $50/hr then the cost is around $300 worth of support time.<p>being self employed and working solely on the software gives me the liberty to tweak my hourly rate to zero and make me feel good about the deal or raise it higher and make me feel bad about it.<p>But the deal thing provided lot of insight.
- At low price point the software sells like fire
- Users really want the software
- Hopefully they will talk to their colleagues and buy more licenses 
- Generate more traction<p>Next time, may be I will do the deal at a little higher price point and see how it goes.",1319300882

Couldn't agree more. Businesses need to pursue metrics around customer-lifetime-value with a vengeance.

I know of folks who now find it painful to buy something (services, food etc.) at full price. The implications are immense -- there's been a permanent & massive shift in consumer behavior. 
Also, there's tons of folks starting small businesses increasingly, to keep re-fueling the groupon's of the world.<p>Over time, I'm pretty certain this'll be the result:

This is a mistake that I sometimes make myself; I feel we all do.<p>What I sometimes don't realize early enough, in testing and debugging strange behavior is that the code may not have ever worked the way the person expected.<p>I had a need to implement some fairly trivial case folding in C (I was/am a noob at C). The code was meant to check a policy database to see if something was allowed or denied. Some policy decisions were deemed critical and therefore hard coded, and they happened to be the easiest ones to test with so I changed one character of each case and expected it to fail the static check and move on to the database lookup. After an hour of testing without a debugger and reviewing only my code that changed, I broke out GDB and noticed where the problem was. The code that I assumed working was broken. The code had an || where an && was desired in an optimization to avoid comparing the strings if the length wasn't the same.<p>If I had added a character, I would have never noticed the bug.",1319299695

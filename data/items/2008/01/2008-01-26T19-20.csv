It is good to hear feedback that maybe negative, yet it helps render a better product!  That's not noise that is feedback!",1201375813

It's a really well written book (so far), but uses Rails 1.8, not Rails 2. Is there actually any benefit to using 2 over 1.8?",1201375763

On the off-chance that it does make the front page, it will get hammered, and any scalability bugs will instantly bring the site down. It would be unfortunate to miss all that traffic.<p>Also, put the company name in your signature whenever you send e-mails, forum or blog comments, etc..",1201375463

He doesn't understand that Apple's reasoning for enhancing the resolution on the iPhone was to make the interface look amazing, not to stuff data into each pixel.<p>I can see how lots of people would agree with him-- seeing thousands of data points on one screen makes sense. But it sacrifices usability and makes the experience less fun and more difficult-- look at his weather ""fix;"" not only is it very ugly, but it's also difficult to find exactly what the temperature is because of the poor contrast and small, ""image-sized"" resolution. Apple's design is ""cartoony"" because it's supposed to look beautiful, be extremely easy to see, and show minimal data.<p>It reminds me of a quotation: ""A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."" - Antoine de Saint-Exupery",1201375313

104691,comment,104361,104361,0,0,apathy,,,"> efforts such as PigLatin and Sawzall appear to be promising steps in this direction.<p>Sawzall is a parallel logfile analyzer.  It takes logfiles stored into GFS and MapReduces them for reliable billing (which used to be a nightmarish, fundamental revenue problem and is now a nonissue -- all you Nooglers live in a relative utopia).  A unixy tool with a unixy mindset (gee, maybe that's because Rob Pike wrote it).  It's a special-purpose tool that is incredibly good at its job, not a general-purpose filigreed hammer that is supposed to nail everything in sight.  And the fact that the authors could possibly overlook this speaks volumes about their myopia.<p>Stonebraker naturally refused to answer the most obvious criticism of all -- <i>HEY ASSHOLE, WHAT ABOUT BIGTABLE?</i><p>But then, if he addressed that, he'd no longer have an essay.  And if Google took his advice they wouldn't have the revenues to have made it as a company.  But that's not really something that academics think about, is it?",1201374004

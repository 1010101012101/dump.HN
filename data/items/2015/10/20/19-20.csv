The article specifically frames it as a problem of English linguistic deficiencies, which is incredibly naive. With math, children are essentially learning a new and unfamiliar symbolic language.<p>All of these correlations between language and cognition are interesting, but if you&#x27;re interested in Sapir-Whorf, you&#x27;re still looking at overall effects that are weak and small, overall. This correlation between linguistic/mathematical behavior may be stronger in a language like Piraha, but Daniel Everett would argue that what&#x27;s going on there is less linguistic determinism and more of a cultural bias against the abstract or non-concrete. \n<a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2013/10/16/piraha_cognitive_anumeracy_in_a_language_without_numbers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2013/10/16/piraha_...</a><p>And look here at this paragraph in the OP: &quot;The U.S.-Asian math-achievement gap—a sensitive and much-studied topic—has more complicated roots than language. Chinese teachers typically spend more time explaining math concepts and getting students involved in working on difficult problems. In the home, Chinese parents tend to spend more time teaching arithmetic facts and games and using numbers in daily life, says a 2010 study in the Review of Educational Research by researchers at the Hong Kong Institute of Education and the University of Hong Kong.&quot; Yet overall outcomes are taken as evidence of English&#x27;s &quot;linguistic disadvantages&quot;.<p>East Asian languages DO handle base-10 math in a simple, direct way that is easy to learn. This is especially true in Chinese, but begins to fall apart in Japanese. Japanese uses simpler words for higher numbers: ni-juu-hachi (two-ten-eight) for 28, for example. But Japanese also has two series of words for numbers under 10: 1 may be ichi or hitotsu, 2 may be ni or futatsu. These combine with a large series of counter words that makes counting in Japanese much more complex. Might this impact Japanese children&#x27;s acquisition of numeracy? Plausibly, but it&#x27;s easier to just elide over the differences in Asian languages handling of numbers.<p>There are just a plethora of linguistic differences between Asian languages and English, that necessarily impact education. Take the writing system, where Japanese has probably the most complex written system in the world, that takes over a decade to read proficiently even for native speakers. English has a terrible orthography, whose irregularities and inconsistencies make it difficult for children to learn and exacerbate economic inequality and linguistic privilege.<p>We really could spend a lot less classroom time on learning reading and writing the differences between plough, dough, and cough and more time on STEM if we improved the English orthography, but I don&#x27;t exactly see the WSJ reporters calling for spelling reform =/ \n<a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/02/how-the-english-language-is-holding-kids-back/385291/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/02/how-the...</a>",1445369437

There is no production. It is entirely consumption. Recycling is all very well – and we do need secondary markets – but we cannot build an economy solely on sweating existing assets. An economy that exists solely on consumption has no long-term future.<p>Sharing is a process that optimizes usage of available resources.  Why should we make more cars than we need?  Why should everyone have a boat if not everyone needs a boat?  Sure, more boat-building jobs are &quot;created&quot; if we feel everyone really needs their own personal boat, but there seems to be a strong opportunity cost that is being forgotten here: the labor necessary to build boats could instead be directed into a more <i>useful</i> form that advances society as a whole much more quickly.<p>What do I mean by advance?  Well, I guess to some degree that&#x27;s subjective.  But I&#x27;m fairly certain everyone can agree on at least <i>some</i> universal goals that humanity would like to achieve, and artificially increasing the number of jobs available for the sake of having more jobs available seems like it would hurt our overall progress in the long run.<p>I think this quote from Warren Buffet sums up what I&#x27;m trying to say much better than I can:<p>> The way I see it is that my money represents an enormous number of claim checks on society. It is like I have these little pieces of paper that I can turn into consumption. If I wanted to, I could hire 10,000 people to do nothing but paint my picture every day for the rest of my life. And the GNP would go up. But the utility of the product would be zilch, and I would be keeping those 10,000 people from doing AIDS research, or teaching, or nursing. I don&#x27;t do that though. I don&#x27;t use very many of those claim checks. There&#x27;s nothing material I want very much.

I don&#x27;t know enough about the law to know if an appeal is possible, but if the &quot;murder plot&quot; evidence was mostly based on conversations with Force and the evidence he provided <i>to</i> Ulbricht about a threat, it does seem a bit dodgy. If he tells RU that he is being targeted, tries to extort him, and otherwise introduces those elements into the equation it seems like it is self-serving for his extortion attempt.

Others include the BMW X5 and 5 Series, and the Chevrolet Corvette.<p>> When automakers roll out new technology, be it infotainment, transmissions, or engine variations, it often has a deleterious effect on vehicle reliability. Tesla is not only the poster child for a new type of high-performance, high-mileage EV, but it also has been adding complex new variations as assembly-line updates, such as all-wheel drive this year. So it’s not surprising to see problems continue to crop up.<p>> Despite the problems, our data show that Tesla owner satisfaction is still very high: Ninety-seven percent of owners said they would definitely buy their car again.

Another good example is the evolution of X11, culminating with Wayland, where applications draw the UI themselves using libraries instead of sending primitive draw commands to a server.",1445367657

Parts of this article mirror comments he has made to me about his lack of understanding in k-4 and how poorly things were explained. He was so desperate to learn math, he lied to me and his teacher both for an entire year in order to sneak his math work home and have me explain it to him.",1445367641

Seriously, this is not an old feature they are working on, this is brand new stuff. Come one! On top of that, unless you created your instance today you get a dialog that tells you to add a second IPv4 address to eth0, which does not actually work on Linux. I would really love to use features like this, but, ya know, maybe test this stuff first?",1445367627

Picky dynamically typed languages like Erlang or Python will pretty reliably produce an error/exception at the scene of the crime.

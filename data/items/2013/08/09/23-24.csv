6189367,comment,6188961,6189318,4,0,mjn,,,"<i>Houston is a decent city once you get to know it and if you can embrace the cowboy-style.</i><p>Now I&#x27;m wondering what I missed in Houston. I lived there for years, and graduated from high school there. But what do cowboys have to do with it? My experience of it was that it was just a modern American city like anywhere else, with a heavy focus on sprawling suburbs. I didn&#x27;t feel there was a lot of uniquely &quot;Texan&quot; culture or anything. Life had little to do with cowboys; it revolved around living in suburban houses that cover literally hundreds of square miles (most of the city), and doing things like studying to get into good colleges and trying to get a decent job. Nobody I knew even spoke with a Texan accent, which was something more associated with West Texas or the Panhandle, places like San Angelo or Lubbock.<p>Now if you had said flying cockroaches, africanized ants, hurricane evacuations, and 6 months of the year where you can&#x27;t reasonably go outside because it&#x27;s >90 F and humid as hell, then yes, it&#x27;s great if you can embrace that part of the lifestyle. ;-) I do like visiting nowadays, but only in December.",1376092759

Information kept to prevent abuse can just as easily be repurposed for surveillance.

Not knowing that a site like a hypothetical Stack Overflowwhere a feature like this was implementedis keeping records on this level and therefore not opting out isn&#x27;t informed choice.<p>Indeed, a significant portion of the outcry with respect to the NSA leaks is that nobody knew that the government had such a direct connection to the information stored by private companies that people could&#x27;ve easily opted out of using (e.g., Facebook, Apple, Google, or Paltalk).<p>But all I was attempting to do here was mention a past experience with Panopticlick and muse how it might&#x27;ve went today.

If we assume that all the hard work of actually doing things is taken care of, and just looking at the API of the command line tools (the C api&#x27;s are generally worse).<p>The NSS command line tools require you to provide a provide a entropy file of &quot;sufficient size&quot;.  &quot;Oh!&quot; you think, &quot;I&#x27;m on linux, I can just use /dev/random&quot;.  No, it tries to read the entire file, and thus hangs infinitely after using up all your entropy.  &quot;Ok, I&#x27;ll do something like: dd if=/dev/random of=- bs=1024 count=1 | .... --nonce-file /proc/self/fd/0&quot;, nope, doesn&#x27;t work, because it tries to read from this file multiple times.  (Also how big is &quot;sufficient&quot;?  8196 bits of entropy seems overkill worth of entropy I just threw down the toilet, but the opposite case is even worse.)<p>The openssl command line tool has a simple &quot;ca&quot; command, which appears to be the &quot;State of the art&quot;, but doesn&#x27;t support revoking keys or even concurrent access.  The openssl command line in general is confusing and difficult to remember.<p>PKCS#11 is a nice C api, but there&#x27;s no standardised config to tell the machine to use PKCS#11 for everything, so you have to specify it on every command line.  Forget it just once and you&#x27;ve possibly just created a key thats not in your HSM and you might not notice that.<p>A little bit of UI TLC would make the world much more secure.  SSH sees high levels of uptake because while it has strong crypto, it&#x27;s relatively easy to use.<p>Exploits with people using TLS and then not properly verifying the far ends cert is usually down to the fact that library that they&#x27;re using doesn&#x27;t provide a &quot;just verify the cert for me&quot; but expects every developer to implement it themselves.  Most libraries will default to ridiculously stupid ciphers, even if the other end will let you negotiate stronger ciphers, again requiring every application developer to make sure that they have overridden the defaults to something sane, and perhaps just offloading the problem onto the system administrator.<p>djb&#x27;s NaCl has a nice API, but it&#x27;s incompatible with everything, so you can&#x27;t use it to interoperate with the rest of the world.  (Also djb has a history of abandonware, and licenses that prevent other people from continuing to maintain the software as the realities around it evolve, so it&#x27;s probably not useful for something that&#x27;s going to last >3-5 years.).<p>Crypto is notoriously difficult to get right, but the API of the current tools (both the language bindings and CLI tools) makes it far harder than it needs to be, inviting a slew of additional errors.",1376090809

With email, we had to hold on to all sorts of metadata in the email headers (no matter how it&#x27;s stored, we would obviously have to be able to read it, in order to provide &#x27;email&#x27; service).

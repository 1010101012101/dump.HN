9036917,comment,9034884,9036253,0,0,cortesoft,,,"There are so many ways to argue against this article. The fact that the person you responded to didn&#x27;t go into as much detail as the author is just because the author spent a lot of time writing all of this nonsense down. Here are a few arguments against the author:<p>1) The argument that an employee is a &#x27;slave&#x27; and &#x27;dominated&#x27; by the employer would work the other way, as well. The author says &quot;A worker must obey the boss, or ultimately lose the job.&quot; You could say this about the reverse, too: &quot;A boss must obey his worker, or ultimately the worker will quit&quot; If the boss fires the worker, the worker has to find a new job. If the worker quits, the boss has to find a new worker. Now, there are a lot of good arguments as to why the power dynamic is not equal between a worker and a boss, but it isn&#x27;t an a priori fact like this author makes it seem.<p>2) The ideas about value are non-sensical. No one argues that things have a universal agreed upon value, nor does economics rely on that idea. Yes, the value of something varies from person to person, but that very fact is what allows an economy to function at all! If everything had equal value to everyone, then no one would ever make any transaction. The value of something TO A PARTICULAR PERSON is exactly equal to what they would be willing to trade for it. The idea that &quot;In a barter system, for an exchange to be fair, the value of the exchanged goods and services must be equal. However, value is unknowable, therefore barter falls apart on practical grounds&quot; is totally not true. Each person knows exactly what they are willing to trade for some good r service. In fact, this idea is non-sensical just from observation; obviously barter does not fall apart on practical grounds, because every single society on earth practices it. Put a group of people together with some goods, and a barter economy will develop. See any prison for an example.<p>These are just two examples of the ridiculousness of the author&#x27;s argument. There are countless more.",1423706186

Still, there&#x27;s been no security audit and it is highly likely Tox isn&#x27;t completely secure, given it&#x27;s alpha software.

Saying it&#x27;s &quot;alpha&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean to anything to non-tech-savvy, they will think it&#x27;s missing a feature or two, not that their privacy and security is possibly compromised.<p>I believe it&#x27;s my moral obligation, and of everyone&#x27;s else reading this, not to use Tox.

I really do; we need great teachers giving their best to the students, and it won&#x27;t happen unless they&#x27;re not living in poverty. On a more personal level, it sucks to feel like you have to heavily compromise for your dream job.<p>I was on a similar path about 4 years ago- 2 years into a PhD, preparing myself for a career in academia devoted to the two intellectual loves of my life: computer science research and teaching. And then I saw my older lab mates on the verge of graduation, struggling to get a decent offer that wasn&#x27;t halfway around the world. I saw post docs in my lab, who had been working hard for years for very little pay and no prospect of &quot;tenure track&quot; anytime soon.<p>What did I do? I left for startup landia, where a company was willing to pay me 3x more than I could have made as a post doc 5 years later (and many times more what I made as a grad student). Now I work in R&D at a large company, paid way more than even a tenured professor (and I&#x27;m not even considered senior yet). The research is different, but just as gratifying at the end of the day. And I get to teach by volunteering for a non profit over the weekends.<p>Does it suck that I had to leave academia for a comfortable life? Absolutely. I wish I could have been a professor. But you have to vote with your feet, because as long as you accept the conditions imposed by the university, well nothing&#x27;s going to change- why would they? Writing blog posts and sending ranty emails to students (who probably don&#x27;t give a shit) isn&#x27;t going to change much at all.<p>If you want to have an impact, quit your job and go somewhere else. Right now universities can afford to pay professors (ie the only ones doing real work) like shit and give great bonuses to administrators because professors are okay with this. Yes, that&#x27;s right: you might be writing a blog post saying how upset you are, but at the end of the day, if you&#x27;re employed by them then you agree with them. Things will change if enough professors quit and universities have to offer better pays to get quality teachers; but as long as that doesn&#x27;t happen, things won&#x27;t change.",1423705692

Usually the price equals what it cost to produce the things plus a little extra, which we&#x27;ll call &quot;profit&quot; because it sounds cool.
2) if someone else (we&#x27;ll call them the consumer) pays the price, then maybe the price of the next item will rise, or maybe it won&#x27;t.
3) if no one pays the price before the producer runs out of patience, then the producer might lower the price or maybe they&#x27;ll leave.

They have central very successful products, and are spreading their influence in numerous new markets while betting a lot on artificial restrictions keeping users in their ecosystem.<p>Sony wasn&#x27;t the biggest company in the world I think, and the game was a lot more primitive back then, but I remember owning a walkman with a Cybershot, a Sony music compo and at the end a matching laptop because all of there where integrated. If I had the money at the time I&#x27;d bought a Handicam and a matching TV in a heartbeat.<p>Sony seemed unstoppable, until the pieces just crumbled; there would be way better laptops, the camera market evolved and there were far from keeping in touch with the best players in the field, then the music industry moved on, and keeping the integration going on becomes more and more compromising.<p>With today&#x27;s Apple, while they are spreading, the same cracks seem to appear to me.<p>They still have very competitive products on each market, but these are more and more compromised as deep design decisions are made and the competition is getting better.<p>As an anecdote, a year ago I broke my iPhone and decided to go android for a few month waiting for the iPhone 6, and surprisingly to me it didn&#x27;t really matter much in my day to day use, except for the artificial limitations (no iCloud, no iMessage) on the integration. But these limitations instead of being a deal breaker, really forced me to go into Google/third party centric services on my laptop/ipad/other family members devices. In a Apple heavy household there is now one device that forces the others to change service providers for central things like email, messaging, calendar, online storage, and the thing is it&#x27;s not really difficult nor handicapping, the pros and cons balance very well.<p>Interestingly enough, with Apple Pay, Apple is starting to step on the feet of the new Sony who&#x27;ve been investing in payment processing and ecosystem for so many years now.<p>TLDR; I think Apple has started playing a game that put them in a position where they have to be better than everyone else at basically everything. Right now I don&#x27;t think they are at the top of their game, especially in giving options to their customers or software quality/reliability. So, while they have a ton of money and are super successful, I think there is even bigger pitfalls waiting for them ahead. Hope they don&#x27;t fall.",1423705459

9036862,comment,9035549,9035549,0,0,breckinloggins,,,"Things that also get my goat (from a less type theoretic point of view):<p>- Assuming that type checking is the only thing you might want to do with your program at compile time. There are, in fact, arbitrarily many things you might want to do at compile time. Textual preprocessing, expansion macros, type checking, C++ template metaprogramming, etc. are all obvious examples. The fact that most languages bolt all of these things on as one-off features is a sign that something deeper is being missed (perhaps the 3-Lisp[1] idea, for example, or just consider plain ol&#x27; Lisp macros).<p>- Assuming that totality, soundness, and lack of side effects are always type checking virtues. Sometimes I&#x27;d like a &quot;typechecker&quot; that isn&#x27;t always guaranteed to terminate. Sometimes I&#x27;d like my typechecker to launch some missiles. This is really more about the previous point.<p>- Assuming that type checking is NOT desired at runtime. Sometimes it is. Clojure&#x27;s core.typed has the property that it is &quot;just code&quot; and can therefore be run at anytime and used for things other than checking that your code is safe to ship. [2]<p>- Assuming that a program that fails type checking shouldn&#x27;t be run. Maybe it should and the parts of the program that fail type checking should be run inside some monadic context. Maybe we want not only gradual typing, but gradual enforcement. Maybe if we had richer type data, then &quot;failing type checking&quot; wouldn&#x27;t be binary. Perhaps a program that fails certain type checks has to add runtime support to enable certain features, but if the same program type checked to be about pure memory locations, the runtime would vanish and a &quot;straight to the metal&quot; program would remain. (In other words, maybe what we currently call a language&#x27;s &quot;runtime&quot; should just be a residue of things that couldn&#x27;t be checked at compile time, among other things.)<p>- Assuming that types and the type checker should be a fixed feature of the language. Perhaps type checking should be something that is built as a library from language primitives. Take this far enough and you get something like exotypes. [3] Which reminds me...<p>- Assuming that &quot;type&quot; is the only kind of metadata you might like to attach to a symbol, expression, or value. There are many other things I might like to express, and I might like to use the usual machinery of type checking to analyze or work with those things. Clojure&#x27;s value-level metadata and Common Lisp&#x27;s property lists are some good examples of generalizing this.<p>- Focusing on manifest typing for verifiability of programs and ignoring the extra information it gives tooling. Visual Studio&#x27;s IntelliSense and F#&#x27;s type providers are examples. At least one person at Microsoft has trouble sleeping at night because he or she is worrying about when the rest of us are going to figure this one out. [4]<p>- Assuming that most programmers want one or the other. The article touched on this, but I wanted to expound a bit. I would like my original prototype to feel like play-doh and my finished product to feel like concrete. Why do I have to do this in two different languages? &quot;Oh I&#x27;ll prototype it in python and then switch to Haskell when I want it to be safe.&quot; What?<p>- In general, assuming that it is the job of the language designer to provide the safety nets, rather than the DSL or API designer. A suitably designed programming language is one that could prevent operation Foo in layer 3 while allowing it in layers 1 and 2. This is one reason why languages like Idris are so complicated. Dependent types HAVE to be complicated because the language designer feels that it is his or her job to make sure the part of your program that runs at compile time terminates and doesn&#x27;t do anything &quot;bad&quot;. Why do we rarely question this assumption?<p>[1] <a href=""http://lisp-univ-etc.blogspot.com/2012/04/lisp-hackers-pascal-costanza.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lisp-univ-etc.blogspot.com/2012/04/lisp-hackers-pasca...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/clojure/core.typed"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojure/core.typed</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2594307"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2594307</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2013/01/30/twelve-type-providers-in-pictures.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2013/01/30/twelve-type...</a>",1423705302

This meant either banding together consciously, for example a tribe, where duties could be allocated somewhat equally, or trading one&#x27;s specialties for those of another&#x27;s.

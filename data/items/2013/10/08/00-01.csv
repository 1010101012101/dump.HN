The truth is, while there may be laws which are unjust, unfair, or plain silly, most of them were created to meet a need or solve a problem.<p>This is very true, but it doesn&#x27;t represent the views of all libertarians or even all anarcho-capitalists. For a much better approach to anarcho-capitalismone that focuses primarily on economics and not on moralitycheck out David Friedman&#x27;s writings and talks.

The New York Times runs anywhere from $16 to $30 per month, depending on which level access you&#x27;re willing to pay for. The Washington Post is $9.99 per month. You&#x27;d likely need to bundle in at least one top publication to sell people on the subscription, and every site you add will jack the price up based on the price they can demand for access to just their site.<p>I think a better solution be an E-ZPass equivalent for the web. Subscribers add credits to their accounts ($1.00 = 100 or 1,000 credits), and publishers can set the tolls for their content however they want, i.e., 1 credit per article, 5 credits after your 10th article, 1,000 credits for a week on the site, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that micropayments can&#x27;t work in combination with other revenue models.",1381193546

I have found myself personally deceived by some of his lies. For instance, on page 39 of <i>Outliers</i>, he writes:<p><i>The striking thing about Ericssons study is that he and his colleagues couldnt find any naturals, musicians who floated effortlessly to the top while practicing a fraction of the time their peers did. Nor could they find any grinds, people who worked harder than everyone else, yet just didnt have what it takes to break the top ranks.</i><p>The first time I read this passage, I thought it was one of the most extraordinary pieces of information I&#x27;d ever encountered. It meant that practice almost completely determines ability! I mostly believed that for more than 4 years. (And so did the rest of the world -- that&#x27;s the core of the 10000 hours meme.)<p>It turns out that the passage is completely false. Ericsson&#x27;s study did not actually say anything about individual violinists at all -- it only ever reported average statistics of groups of violinists.<p>Other studies of the relationship between total practice time and ability have found that different people may reach a given level of ability with enormously different practice totals. For instance a study of chess players found that the average amount of practice time needed to reach the Master level is ~11000 hours -- but the standard deviation of the distribution is more than 5000 hours. One person only took 3000 hours to reach Master level. Another took 23000 hours.

One of the principals that enables Kanban development is that management should not dictate worker process. If management doesn&#x27;t know that they may be tempted to fix the development problems with more process, which actually disempowers the workers. Adding more dictated process may work in the short term, but it&#x27;s a tactical fix, not a strategic one. A well run business keeps tactics and strategy in balance, and hopefully delegates the tactics as low as possible, to retain empowerment. Good management acts as a multiplier to worker productivity. Bad management cripples what it&#x27;s trying to manage.<p>So yes, you need good management, but good management alone does not guarantee success. Management cannot be the source of the solution to every problem.<p>The other bit to take into account is that management can benefit just as much from its own cycle of metrics, feedback and retrospective action. All levels of an organization need to be able to improve, not just the developer teams. However, that&#x27;s usually a completely different set of tools and skill sets.",1381192507

I am disappointed to see people nitpicking over the way some things have been coded.

Something has changed culturally and psychologically in the time since then. The psychological gap between paying and not paying now is narrower than it was 10 years ago. This is in large part due to developments that have taken place in the time since, especially the iTunes model. In the 90s people  people were extremely cautious about purchasing things online. In the beginning it didn&#x27;t happen at all, but Amazon and the development of e-commerce broke that barrier. People began to think nothing of giving out their credit card information and home addresses to purchase things that will ultimately be shipped to their homes. Then, paying for all-digital premium content became the norm, especially because of iTunes. iTunes completely normalized the concept of a small payment for quick and easy access to content. People think nothing of purchasing an app or a song in two seconds on iTunes, because psychologically $1.00 doesn&#x27;t mean a whole lot to them and easily fits within their recreational budget and it is exceedingly convenient.<p>I think the next form of content to fall into this model will be written content. First major newspapers had to stop giving away their content for free (they already have as you point out). People have shown that they are willing to pay for this formerly free content. Now comes the part where they start charging for a la carte access to articles. I&#x27;ve already seen this on some magazines - GQ? Time perhaps? I forget - and I must admit I&#x27;ve clicked through a few times, and I don&#x27;t have a lot of disposable income.

You can still make money in the box office and on advertising. For news outlets and periodicals, their websites replace their initial product, the publication itself. Spotify falls somewhere between the two: streaming music can replace the intial product of a CD, LP or download, but it&#x27;s also allows you to offer a new product to people that would never purchase the initial one.<p>Another point to consider is that piracy has had a huge impact on the music, movie and television industries. They had to compete against free. Netflix and Spotify may make less money for labels and producers than DVD and CD sales did, but it&#x27;s more than they get from everyone who would torrent their stuff instead.<p>If you bundled unlimited access to multiple publications for a monthly fee, and distributed payouts to publishers based on their share of views/reads, you&#x27;d just end up reproducing the current situation, where the competition for pageviews is a race to the bottom.",1381191851

The sun is proof that nature can do this on a grand scale!  It may be a long ways off, but &quot;a long ways&quot; becomes &quot;never&quot; without experimental work like the NIF.  Yes, the U.S. is probably doing this primarily to create new weapons just as the space race was really about developing ICBM&#x27;s. However, the fundamental science being done has huge long-term potential. It&#x27;s a sad, but true fact that, sometimes, scientists have to use the megalomania of states to fuel research that has the potential to benefit all of humanity.<p>Fission power is a separate matter. The single most important thing that most people still do not understand is that power grids have almost zero capacity for storing energy.  That means most alternative energy sources, such as wind or solar, can never exceed a certain percentage of the grid&#x27;s production capacity or it will become unstable. On-demand energy generation is still needed, and there&#x27;s absolutely no reason to fear nuclear power while we&#x27;re still using coal power, which is far more deadly in every sense! It&#x27;s not just the West that has this fear either.

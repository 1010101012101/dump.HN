3328086,comment,3327202,3327608,6,0,jforman,,,"<i>- Add a display that shows the current positions of both control sticks. Add an alarm when the two sticks are not within a certain margin of the each other, if both are engaged. Such as if one is full forward & the other is full back.</i><p>This was my first thought as well.  Confusion in one pilot was allowed to cause confusion in the second pilot, because he didn't realize that his partner was doing something unexpected and incorrect.  If you make sure a pilot can always detect inconsistent reaction in a co-pilot, you can keep them in sync and prevent spreading confusion.  An alarm when the two pilots are out of sync seems like a pretty straightforward benefit.",1323327533

So I don't see that 10-person vehicles would become the norm.  I would actually see it going the other way, and that 2 person vehicles the size of a smart would actually become the norm.  Most people currently have excess seating capacity (5) for the few occasions when they need it.  But with driverless cars, you don't need that, because you can spread the load over several cars.  Why drive a 10 capacity car around for the odd case where 10 people need to go to the one location, rather than 5 2 person cars that can assemble when needed to cart 10 people on the same trip.",1323327142

He's not saying that utilization will go up to 96% precisely, or that there will be 20x fewer cars. He is challenging us to imagine the possibilities ourselves, seeding it with some immediate (potential) implications. On first sight his assumptions seem reasonable, and it's up to us individually to determine what the ramifications are.<p>Indeed the potential is enormous for freeing up a lot of human time/etc. We will need less parking certainly, cars will be running newer models (since they're used more, they'll likely last less time) with better technologies, and potentially there will be more efficient routing algorithms to save energy, time, etc.<p>I like how HN is often first to criticize, but sometimes you're just missing the point.

3328056,comment,3327232,3327603,2,0,brc,,,"I was thinking along these lines on a similar thread recently.   The particular thread implied that the cost would be much lower, because there was no driver involved.  I agree that it would be lower, but not orders of magnitude lower, because the demand shape will be exactly the same - or even more pronounced.<p>My hypothesis is that the driver is probably about 10-20% of the cost of a fare, the rest is the capital cost of the vehicle + licensing fees + insurance, and the marginal cost of maintenance and fuel.  Because inevitably cars sit around most of the time, then the price of 5-6 busy hours of the day has to make up for the rest of the time.<p>Further, with a disruptive business idea like this, I could easily see an auction-style interface for the vehicle booking, which would give a much better revenue curve (we are talking about Google).  In that case, the peak-demand period would probably exceed the current (regulated) taxi fares.  But the plus side of that is that a midnight ride would be very cheap due to lack of demand and simultaneous lack of a need to pay drivers more money to work nightshifts.",1323326833

I enjoyed WebOS, unfortunately it was limited by subpar hardware, and I've enjoyed my brief encounters with WP7. The two Android devices I've owned just felt seriously half-baked and perpetually in a state of flux. I feel like Google applies their mindset for developing web apps to Android whereas some of the other phone makers are approaching it more like releasing a finished product. In the last year alone I feel like I've had at least 3 different GUIs for the Android Market for example. I went from mostly stock Android to the MOTOBLUR bastardized version with an update for my Droid X. I'm all for improvements when needed but too many of these changes are just completely arbitrary. It reminds me of the old Windows upgrade shuffle where some critical things got moved around for no obvious reason. Going back to developers I can understand why supporting 2-3 major versions, dealing with dramatically different screen sizes, etc just seems like too much trouble.

As they say, there are entrenched interests that won't like that.  For example, if you can rent cars that way, I don't see the people with those very expensive taxi medallions being any too happy about that.  Yes, getting rid of that would be a good thing, but the people who own them won't be any too happy about the value of their investment vanishing.<p>Also, there's what happens with accidents.  For example, look at that story we have right now about the autopilot flaking out for what?  A minute?  Only to have the pilots get confused and crash the plane.  People underrate intentional risks because they feel that they have control.  Conversely, they overrate risks where they do not have that feeling.  Driverless cars are firmly in the ""don't have control"" pile.  Sure, the computer is likely to be a much safer driver than most people, but that also means being a nicer driver (which will <i>really</i> piss off some people, passengers and other drivers alike), and people with low skill overrate their abilities.

In a good condition engine, the oil pump starts giving meaningful pressure the moment the starter turns, and starts pumping fresh oil throughout the engine.<p>However, when cold, an engine has the wrong tolerances to account for when the materials heat up and the materials expand.  So the oil pressure isn't quite right.<p>As the engine ages this problem gets worse, so each startup cycle gets progressively worse.  This is why a car with a worn engine will show the 'oil pressure' light for an increasingly long time after it's started.<p>The length of service life for an engine will come down to 
a) operating hours (not just distance)
b) operator abuse (revving while cold, excessive RPMs throughout use)
c) service attention (oil changes, filter changes, coolant changes)
d) duty cycles (how many times it heats up and down).<p>The worst thing you can do for a car is a lot of short trips with a big enough spacing to let the engine cool, and aggressive driving while the engine is still cold.<p>An F1 engine is seized when cold, it requires several hours of warm water and oil to be pumped around to bring up the metals to the operating temperature.<p>Modern engines can go a very long way if cared for properly.",1323326229

In some cases I think it might also be the right answer if your nose is level but you're losing altitude, e.g. when in a strong downdraft.<p>Pulling back was the wrong thing in this situation because the plane was in stall, but due to sensor problems and later high angle of attack/low airspeed, the avionics didn't have a complete image and an absolute certainty that the plane was in a stall (hence the stall warnings cutting in and out, too).

When you are sat in a plane where that is happening (I have done this in a training exercise) you really cannot feel anything unusual at first - the forces you experience from the different accelerations cancel out.  Until all of a sudden you do feel it - at that point you are pitched with the wings at about 45 degrees and the nose pointing about 45 degrees towards the ground.  Suddenly you feel it a lot.  That is a very scary experience, and one of the reasons to ignore your body if you are a pilot.<p>When I experienced it it was in clear skies, so it would be rather obvious that it was happening just by looking out of the window, but apparently this can happen to inexperienced pilots in clouds.<p>See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_spiral"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_spiral</a>",1323325973

If not by legislation, probably by insurance companies offering discounts on vehicles so equipped.<p>It's already an issue with ABS braking in that people run into things even though they could steer around them - simply because they become fixated on pressing the brake harder and harder rather than trying to steer the car away from the impending object.<p>As people learn to drive with these aids and rely on them, they will become dangerous when one or more become faulty.  I can see a point where people start to rely on automatic braking and don't bother putting their foot on the brake.  Or take their hands off the wheel on the freeway because the car keeps it in the lane for them.<p>All this is great until something stops - a camera gets a squashed bug, a wheel sensor breaks from a stone, anything.  And the car will be under partial human control and the inputs will be badly exaggerated.<p>This will become a large issue in the design of vehicle interfaces and driver training in years to come.

3327954,comment,3327202,3327826,6,0,nkurz,,,"<i>why wouldn't the computer have emergency functions to negate strange situations like this?</i><p>I think there are two main reasons.  First, one is dealing with a situation where the autopilot has disengaged because it is receiving contradictory input from its sensors.  How is the computer to know that a second sensor has not failed, and that its notion of what is normal is not?  Failures may tend to cluster.  The current technological presumption is that in the event of something unexpected, trust the human over the computer. At the current level of technology, this is still often a good bet.<p>Second, I think the legal situation encourages having a human be the final point of control.  Presume that computer overrode the human, and that due to some low-probability unexpected combination of failures this caused the plane to crash despite the pilot doing ""the right thing"" as proven by the flight recorder.  Then picture the size of the lawsuit against the everyone involved in the building and licensing of the plane.  Contrast this with the same situation, but with the pilot responsible and dead in the crash.  One may find that there isn't much desire from the manufacturer to change the system to take that final responsibility.",1323324838

Bingo - your control system just extracted the exact opposite of rational human behavior.  If they didn't have traction control, they would have heard the engine rev and the tires spinning, and they would have backed off of the gas.<p>If the pilot weren't under the mistaken impression that the computer would limit his input, he would have NEVER pulled the stick all the way back and held it there - he instead would have been very careful to pull the stick back only just enough to ascend safely.<p>The airline industry may think normal law is a feature.

It is trivially easy to do (see Node.js's CLA which is an entirely electronic form,) and it gives the users all sorts of additional protections that traditional open source licenses can't otherwise provide, such as patent royalty protections.<p>The downside of these CLA agreements is that it allows the controllers of the project to re-release code under a less stringent license, and in some cases a commercial license.

The only way alternative App Stores would catch on is: a) carrier or handset maker replacements b) piracy stores c) increased restrictions on Google's Market that create a demand for a free App Store. None of these options are good for developers so maybe the FUD is somewhat justified if the only solution is making it more difficult for a user to obtain your app.<p>That being said it hasn't happened yet so making an issue out of it does seem FUD-ish. It comes with the territory though. If you want to dominate a market you have to expect scrutiny. People are endlessly entertained by (perceived) hypocrisy.

Sort of like OpenID.Clever PR but not really what it claims to be.<p>How do you justify using the 'open' when it is based upon a propitiatory naming system? With Diaspora, whoever owns trydiaspora.com (anyone know who does?) owns your content and connections, meaning you are effectively trusting someone who is hiding their identity. Nice.<p>We try repeatedly to reach out to the Diaspora team when they kicked-off with an alternative that is 100% open and user-centric called NetID (see <a href=""http://ucentric.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ucentric.org</a>) but were ignored.<p>I guess that when you have $200,000 and no one to answer to, you can pretty much ignore your stated goals and anyone trying to help you achieve them.It also looks like that is basically what they are delivering for the $200k they raised as their blog suggests it is now an open project for the community to finish off...<p>As a side issue, is there any truth in the rumor that Zuckerberg gave them $100K?",1284688931

This story came about in part because Coda Hale (another security pro) posted a message to Twitter, linking to the crypto code in Diaspora with an abstract ""uh oh"". It was warranted, I posted a message to that effect, and got an inquiry, which was more properly addressed by Patrick, who has just provided Diaspora with several thousand dollars of free consulting.<p>What was the problem I was getting at? Oh, yeah: Diaspora has no apparent access to the software security expertise they need to pull this off. I looked at it for 17 seconds, rolled my eyes, and stopped reading. Maybe someone at iSec Partners will take this project under their wings. But why? Most software security professionals are up to their ears in interesting projects that aren't attempts by college kids to take on Facebook.<p>More than a few of those professionals are now busy working <i>for Facebook</i>.<p>This is a dumb idea for a project.",1284688853

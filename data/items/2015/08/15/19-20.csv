This means that human beings are capable of having value even if nobody else is around to value them--because they value themselves.<p>I suspect that GP only means that keeping the sabbath, and disconnecting from everything else one gets wrapped up in in the course of everyday life, helps to remind you of this.",1439668786

10066581,comment,10062323,10066372,0,0,Mz,,,"One of my concerns is that modern peoples are already very out of touch with what matters for the creation of things of real value. We already have bizarre ideas that money = value. We already have people who fail to understand the real world underpinnings of the creation of value -- of how you need certain resources and preconditions to have any hope of creating value. We already have too many people who think you fix financial problems, like depression, by manipulating the market economy. We already have a great many people who are intelligent, educated and well-paid who are very out of touch with reality in terms of where food and other important resources come from.<p>The reason it matters to me to have people get money by participating in the economy and not just for existing is because that participation shapes their ideas about what matters. There is no upper limit to what humans can spend or consume. We see this again and again and again. And about 2/3 of lottery winners are bankrupt within 5 years. People who have no education in dealing with wealth just run through it. Their lottery winnings seem &quot;limitless&quot; to them and they just run through it all and end up bankrupt.<p>You are talking about doing that as a universal thing. You are talking about spreading the belief that we have so much wealth right now that every last person can just consume and not produce and it will somehow be okay.<p>I very strongly disagree with this notion. It is not that it simply disincentives work. It is that it further poisons the minds of people who already are out of touch with where real value comes from. I find this incredibly scary stuff.<p>You have to deal with the mental space of humans, not just their bodily needs. You talk about distributing enough money to keep people fed and what not at some basic level and you ignore what that does to their minds and self concept. I think this is extremely dangerous territory and will be disastrous.",1439668155

10066565,comment,10065243,10066525,0,0,seiji,,,"<i>Remember, you can fire them at any time, with or without cause.</i><p>People keep saying that around here.  It&#x27;s technically true (the best kind of true?) but it&#x27;s not exactly how the real world works.<p>In the real world (meaning: actual companies, not startups with 2 weeks runway), to fire an individual (mass layoffs are different), you first put them On Notice (a Personal Improvement Plan saying &quot;we, the company, believe you are not a good employee.  you have X amount of time to improve&quot;).  Next, you wait 6 months.  Then you review their progress against their &quot;plan,&quot; you find any excuse for them not meeting their plan (plans can be subjective), then you say &quot;Sorry, you&#x27;re fired, here&#x27;s a severance package.&quot;<p>So, firing an individual involves interdepartmental paperwork, getting legal potentially involved, and a (hopefully not trivial) payout.<p>Mass layoffs are essentially the same except you don&#x27;t give 3-6 months notice and just immediately unload lots of people at a company, but hopefully still give them a payout.<p>In either case, I think why people throw around &quot;at any time&quot; is they want to convey you should have zero-loyalty towards any employer since they can unilaterally act against you.  That is quite true.  Never trust your employer to be benevolent towards you and always lookout for yourself before sacrificing things for the benefit of only the company.",1439667879

The person asking the question realized that the ~100Mb compressed App Store archive wasn’t all assets - a very large portion was the application binary.<p>How do you answer that question? You quickly reverse engineer the application!<p>1 Download the binary to a jailbroken device from the App Store<p>2 Find the application on the device.\nSSH into the device and find the application container on the filesystem:<p>find / -type d -iname &quot;SomeApp*.app&quot;<p>3 Decrypt the binary\nInstall dumpdecrypted on the device. Follow the instructions for using it.<p>4 Get the files off the device using scp or rsync.\nIn most cases you will want the application container, the decrypted binary, and the application data container (i.e. what it writes out to the filesystem).<p>At this point you have the decrypted binary and it’s files. You can now run class-dump on the binary and output a directory of header files for all the classes in the binary, or you can use a disassembler like IDAPro or Hopper to easily see all the classes, symbols, etc.<p>In the case of the Facebook application, there are more than 18,000 classses in the application:<p>[... list of all the classes ...]\n<a href=""https://gist.github.com/quellish/473f513fbd1310233a8e"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/quellish/473f513fbd1310233a8e</a><p>There is a LOT of crap in there.

So I think the main difference here would be switching() over an enum vs throwing an extra strncmp/hashmap access in there when loading the expression from the incoming network buffer.<p>I think cutting that one strncmp per symbol could be a perfomance upside, but I reckon this would be _tiny_ compared to all the networking and evaluation overhead (think low microseconds for a few compares on strings that all fit within the SSO). But might be an interesting thing to benchmark nonetheless, maybe even against another solution that goes all the way and implements a proper micro vm so it can execute &quot;bytecode&quot; directly from the incoming networking buffer without any intermediate at all.<p>EDIT / side note: just had another look and saw that you are actually storing some symbols as strings in the capnprot messages and then do a lookup in the eval loop, too --- and the symbol lookup is implemented in O(N) by doing a linear scan over the symbol list and comparing the subject with each possible candidate here -- if you care about speed/micro-optimizing I think you can improve this to O(1) or at least logn using a hashmap/multiset -> <a href=""https://github.com/niekbouman/commelec-api/blob/master/commelec-interpreter/adv-interpreter-eval.cpp#L269"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/niekbouman/commelec-api/blob/master/comme...</a><p>another thing if you want to microoptmize: you should try to pass stuff by reference instead of copy in your eval loop wherever possible -- removing as many mallocs() as possible from the inner interpreter eval loop should be one of the most low hanging fruits. what stuck out to me was esp. your use of the auto keyword in the eval code -- some thoughts regarding that:<p>- the &quot;auto&quot; keyword does not automatically take a reference. a plain &quot;auto&quot; may create a copy. use &quot;auto&&quot; or &quot;const auto&&quot; to take a reference<p>- esp. in the new range based for loops: in the places where you are currently using (for auto item : collection) you are performing a copy of all the items while iterating -- for (const auto& item : collection) will eliminate those copies<p>EDIT2: Skimmed your paper and saw it included some benchmarks regarding message size. However you are benchmarking your cap&#x27;n&#x27;proto solution ONLY against MathML, an XML encoded representation (lol).<p>So I tried one example from your paper -- am I missing something here?<p>Expression: &quot;P<i>-10+q^2&quot;<p>- Your capnproto encoding with packing: 82bytes  (value from your paper)<p>- Your capnproto encoding without packing: 280 bytes (value from your paper, actually larger than XML...)<p>- mathml (xml) without packing: 196 bytes  (value from your paper)<p>- mathml (xml) without packing: 164 bytes  (value from your paper)<p>- string encoding of the same expression (&quot;P</i>-10+q^2&quot;): 9 bytes<p>[ Hope I am not coming across as too negative, but since you put it in a paper and published it I think it is fair to do some peer review ]",1439667128

10066490,comment,10065710,10065710,0,0,freditup,,,"As a Christian, I decided a few years back to start taking Sundays as a Sabbath. I don&#x27;t have hard rules, but I mostly stay away from a computer/smartphone/email/etc. So no programming, browsing the internet, finances, none of the normal responsibilities/distractions. Instead I use the day to go to church, read the Bible and other books, pray, nap, spend time with friends and family, and do outdoors activities.<p>In retrospect, this has worked out fantastically for me. I love Sundays now - there is a sense of peace most Sundays which is great. I enter Mondays feeling refreshed and ready to work. I would recommend taking a Sabbath day once a week to anyone, I think it is beneficial regardless of your beliefs.<p>Two notes: First, the idea of a Sabbath is not an idea that condemns work. Christian theology holds working well as a moral virtue and something that honors God. In fact, part of taking a Sabbath, I believe, is working harder and being less lazy the other six days of the week.<p>Second, Whether taking a Sabbath is mandated for Christians is a debated issue, though I personally think it is not. The difference between the ceremonial, civil, and moral law of Judaism and the law&#x27;s applications to Christianity is a complex topic. Christians are definitely not held to the ceremonial/civil law, but the command to keep the Sabbath is part of the Ten Commandments, and thus some view it as a moral imperative. I feel that in the spirit of Christian liberty (a freedom of action but still subject to God&#x27;s moral principles), taking a day for a Sabbath is a personal decision.",1439666721

The frugality is what eventually made me leave because too often it gets implemented as dirt cheapness.  But in their defense, I had opportunities to do things there none of the other big 4 would have granted.  And I got the chance to do them by being confrontational and confident.  The downside is that if one interviews at other companies with one&#x27;s Amazon personality, one will frequently come off as a total a$$hole.<p>Amazon will change you.

Poorly managed, T&M is more likely to incentivize billing than it is quality work product.<p>The keys to a successful outcome here, regardless of engagement structure, are:<p>1. Contract with an experienced freelancer with whom you&#x27;ve discussed the importance of code quality and maintainability. Screen out candidates who can&#x27;t speak intelligently about these topics and can&#x27;t point to real-world examples of quality, maintainable code they&#x27;ve delivered.<p>2. Establish clear requirements before the engagement begins and incorporate them into your contract. A fixed-price contract can actually provide you with more leverage in this regard, as you can tie milestone payments to code reviews.

Add IronPython to the list without a GIL as well.<p>However, Jython, IronPython and PyPy must all variously slow down even single-threaded code without the GIL because Python having the GIL made lists, dicts, and sets threadsafe. The locking (or complex lock-free algorithms or STM in the case of PyPy) is not free.<p>The Python language is just a poor choice for concurrency. It&#x27;s also a poor choice for a glue language, as Lua is much better designed for that, but Python seems to have become popular in that role anyway (likely due to a richer ecosystem.) Python, even with all of PyPy&#x27;s JIT magic is still one of the slower languages. If you&#x27;re using it for real work (not just as glue) and you need extreme performance, then it&#x27;s a poor choice in the first place.<p>Keep in mind that I have a Python day job, and Python has been my favorite language for over a decade.

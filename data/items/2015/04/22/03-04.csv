I read the Kochan books and Apple docs, so I understand properties, memory management, the Foundation Framework, and I can solve problems in objective-C. However, progressing to actually writing an iOS app has been daunting. I bought the BNR book and I tried the getting started guide on the Apple developer website, but I can&#x27;t make the leap to producing anything beyond simple, linear apps like Timers.<p>I know that these are all very good resources, and to a large extent, I can comprehend what&#x27;s going on. However, putting something of my own together has been tough. I can put together simple things using Nav controllers and TableView Controllers, but I&#x27;m having trouble progressing to anything more complex.<p>Having learned what I could learn by myself, I think I&#x27;m at the point where I need to be around people with experience and see how apps are actually made in real life. Unfortunately, iOS meet-ups aren&#x27;t very frequent (which is very weird for NYC) and I don&#x27;t really know anyone from whom I can learn, so I&#x27;m asking you HN; would it be possible to shadow an actual developer for any length of time this summer or meet up whenever you&#x27;re free? It would be great to have someone who already knows what their doing to ask questions and get a feel for iOS development as it&#x27;s done professionally. I don&#x27;t want to reduce anyone&#x27;s productivity and I would be as unobtrusive as possible but I&#x27;d be very grateful if anyone could spare the time. I&#x27;m very dedicated to becoming a good developer and I will bring that same dedication to learning and helping out as soon as I get the hang of everything. So please let me know if you&#x27;d be willing to; it would really help a lot! I&#x27;m in the NYC area, but we can also talk on Skype if you&#x27;d prefer<p>Thank you!",1429673653

Nor is there any reason to think that these systems operated with perfect efficiency. Benedict Spinoza, for instance, used a false name to avoid the wrath of the Spanish Inquisition. Nicholas Copernicus waited until he was on his death bed before risking the publication of his life&#x27;s work. Michelangelo made surreptitious use of cadavers to sharpen his anatomical skills. So yes, deeply influential work did happen on occasion, in spite of efforts to suppress it. But these instances remained the exception, not the rule. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the mere existence of finished creative work testified to its passage through elaborate systems of review and control, and its successful receipt of official sanction.<p>Given the considerable power over people&#x27;s minds that art has always carried, the ubiquity of these systems shouldn&#x27;t be surprising - especially when you remember that from the time sharply stratified societies first appeared in ancient Mesopotamia until the emergence of pluralistic forms of government in and around the 18th century, absolutist autocracies defined virtually all governing systems. Those that didn&#x27;t seize control of cultural production not only lost the benefit of its power, they ran the risk of having that power used against them.<p>Even in cases where producers managed to secure a measure of independence (e.g. Kabuki theater under the Tokugawa Shogunate), much of their creativity focused on the evasion of the controls that remained in place. In this regard, the censorious influence of the ruling class remained profoundly influential, even if their rules were acknowledged mainly in the breach, or in obedience that was flamboyantly limited to the letter of the law, and not its spirit.<p>The development that changed all this was the emergence of pluralistic government, which was characterized by competing groups that each recognized their own inability to dominate government well enough to realize that they were better off in working together to limit government power in general than they were in trying to secure it for themselves exclusively. Sharply curtailing the power of official censors proved to be among the most effective ways of promoting and preserving pluralism. In the wake of these policy developments, humanist strands of culture exploded in volume and popularity.<p>My point is all this is that anyone thinking that the current level of intellectual and creative freedom - or even anything approaching it remotely - is deeply uninformed about the realities of artistic and cultural work throughout the bulk of post-Neolithic history. Yes, the desire to do this work has always existed. But for the most part, the satisfaction of that desire has only been permitted in very narrow and tightly controlled circumstances, and almost invariably in ways that enhance the strength and stature of hereditary rulers. To the extent that history of art reads like the autobiography of power, the democratization of its creation doesn&#x27;t appear until a very recent period.",1429673501

I think millions of accounts are compromised because users are required give up too much information and can&#x27;t verify that their user data is stored in a secure way. The solution to this is on the client side, in the browser, not in the server.<p>The core proposition of this article is that if we make it really easy to store user data correctly, people will do it. This proposition is simply not borne out by the data. Many parts of user security <i>are</i> easy. Take password storage, for example: it&#x27;s so easy a caveman could do it. Every major languge has a library that takes a password and a salt and a number of iterations and runs it through pbkdf2 or scrypt. Many have these functions builtin. But do people do it? No. It seems like once a month some company exposes X-thousand passwords because they stored it in plaintext or MD5. And I bet a significant portion of HN readers think SHA1 is a valid way of storing passwords, eager to sacrifice security as efficiently as possible. pbkdf2 and scrypt aren&#x27;t hard to use, people are just idiots.<p>Making a specialized database just gives people another easy thing to not use.<p>Ultimately there&#x27;s no reason to be giving your password to a service in the first place. You only should be giving them cryptographic proof that you have your password, not giving them your password. This is possible with zero-knowledge password proofs[1], but it would require browsers and other client-side software to implement a ZKPP algorithm. This would force servers to either implement a ZKPP algorithm correctly or expose their incompetence to their users. Similar algorithms can be hypothesized for many other user data needs, but passwords would be an excellent start.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_password_proof"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_password_proof</a>",1429672987

9418475,comment,9414154,9416429,0,0,BinaryIdiot,,,"> I can sympathize the initial fear of transpiling. However, it really is much better than you think. Source maps have made big strides in the past year and Babel has excellent support for them.\nBesides source maps, Babel does a lot to keep the generated code as similar as possible to the input. There are very few features that require complex transpiling.<p>I understand all that but after being bitten by the CoffeeScript transpiler on multiple occasions and Google&#x27;s closure once, I try to avoid it at all costs. It adds an additional level of complexity to projects (needing to transpile before testing / debugging) and I just don&#x27;t want to risk it for such little return, in my opinion.<p>I&#x27;m sympathetic to the cause of getting more people using ES6 and this is a way to do it today but personally I won&#x27;t use it until ES6 is native in all of my browser and server targets.<p>> Transpiling is quite nice, and it&#x27;s very likely that you already do it with something like Uglify or Closure compiler.<p>I&#x27;ve run into an issue with Closure at a point in the past (essentially the optimization to make everything into one statement breaking Opera; that was almost impossible to figure out but thankfully someone else did). But I do use Uglify; I try to limit it to compression only but it still changes things here and there (at least it appeared to; honestly it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve dug into that code).<p>Minification, especially without all of the features enabled, <i>should</i> be safer than any other type of transpiler considering it has far less to do and many of the changes should be able to do so without consequence. Even still I do re-run all of my unit tests against minified versions of my code. It also makes me uneasy still but seems to be a necessary evil :)<p>>> npm may eventually support two versions of the same module, which would enable you to deliver libraries as both ES5 and ES6 for Node.js, io.js and client-side module systems that are based on npm.\n> This will actually be necessary in the node environment if we are ever to migrate to ES6+ features without causing breaking changes for module users.<p>I&#x27;m having a hard time believing this will happen. This adds complexity to every module as they now have to maintain an ES6 and an ES5 version should they actually want to use ES6. Yeah they can transpile but they still have two modules to maintain, track bugs in case there is a difference, etc. This is unrealistic in my opinion and I don&#x27;t get why it&#x27;s even necessary; simply make a certain version of node be required if you want to use ES6. If users can&#x27;t do that they&#x27;ll have to use an older version.<p>Moving to native ES6 on node should happen really quickly compared to the browser space. The browser space is going to be painful.",1429672346

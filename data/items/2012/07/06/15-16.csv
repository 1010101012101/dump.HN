Flaunting the notion of my own importance was even bizarrely empowering.  It's of course completely hollow and meaningless, and ultimately self-defeating.",1341590396

However,  other than that,  the people I know involved with PHP are reasonable people.<p>For me the trouble w/ PHP is that it works too well.<p>I've got a small project w/ 40 hours budgeted for it,  20 of those are software dev,  and 20 are corporate identity and marketing.<p>I have libraries that smooth over the worst flaws of PHP and answers to error handling,  sysadmin,  and all that.  I know the odds are very good I can slap this thing onto one of my production servers,  push the 'go' button,  and have it work for 2 or 3 years before I need to look at it again.<p>Ruby may be nicer,  and Java is better for computationally complex and intensive stuff (not this) but adding a new language to the mix probably means more hosting costs (maybe abother $60-120 a month) and probably turns that 20 hours to 60.  It will take me a long time to have faith in the stability of another hosting system too.<p>The reality is I nail out quite a few of these mini projects,  some of which succeed,  and many of which just smoulder.  With PHP I can get them done quick and done well and have low hosting costs and little maintenance burden.<p>To get me to switch you need to quit complaining about the faults of PHP and build my faith that your hosting system is a 'wooden round' that won't cause my 20-hour project to cost me 50+ hours a year in maintenance costs.",1341590316

Leukemia adalah kanker yang mulai di sel-sel darah.<p>Sel-Sel Kanker Darah (Leukimia)Pada orang-orang dengan leukemia, sumsum tulang menghasilkan sel-sel darah putih yang abnormal. Sel-sel yang abnormal adalah sel-sel leukemia. Pertama, sel-sel leukemia berfungsi hampir secara normal. Pada waktunya, mereka mungkin mendesak sel-sel darah putih, sel-sel darah merah, dan platelet-platelet yang normal. Ini membuat darah berat untuk mengerjakan pekerjaannya.\nCara Menyembuhkan Kanker Darah dengan Obat Ace Maxs.<p>Cara Menyembuhkan Kanker Darah (leukimia) dengan obat ace maxs merupakan cara terbaik untuk mengobati penyakit kaner darah, obat ace maxs ini tidak menyebabkan epek samping, karena obat ace maxs ini terbuat dari bahan-bahan herbal yaitu dari ekstra kulit manggis dan ekstra daun sirsak yang memiliki khasiat yang lebih dari bahan-bahan herbal lainnya dalam membantu berbagai macam penyakit kronis maupun non kronis. Kedua hasil kekayaan alam tropis ini memiliki kandungan zat Gizi yang dengan khasiat yang luarbiasa dalam membantu dalam berbagai penyakit.<p>Khasiat kulit manggis dalam ace maxs.<p>khasiat kulit manggis, selain mengandung Xanthone yang merupakan zat yang memiliki aktivitas antioksidan dan antiinflamasi, kulit buah manggis juga sangat kaya akan antioksidan tinggi yang dapat mengobati berbagai macam penyakit bahkan penyakit maut sekalipun seperti penyakit jantung, kanker,stroke, diabetes, ginjal, hepatitis, AIDS, dan lain-lain.<p>Kulit manggis mengandung 50 senyawa xanthone. Xanthone adalah bioflavonoid yang bersifat antioksidan, antibakteri, antitumor, antialergi, antiinflamasi dan antihistamin. Di alam ini terdapat sekitar 200 jenis xanthone dimana 50 jenis diantaranya berada pada buah manggis (Garcinia mangostana). Senyawa itu tersebar pada kulit buah dan biji, kulit batang, daun serta sebagian kecil pada daging buahnya.<p>Kulit manggis terbukti  sangat efektif sebagai antioksidan. Antioksidan senyawa yang dapat mencegah terjadinya reaksi  terhadap oksidasi radikal bebas. Selanjutnya, antioksidan akan bereaksi dengan radikal bebas sehingga dapat mengurangi kemampuan radikal bebas untuk menimbulkan kerusakan. Mari kita lihat beberapa diantara manfaat kulit buah manggis tersebut bagi kesehatan ;<p>* Menjaga  Kesehatan Tubuh dan Meningkatkan Energi.\n* Memperbaiki Elastisitas Sel Tubuh dan Menurunkan Berat Badan.\n* Menyeimbangkan Sistem Kelenjar Endokrin.\n* Menjaga Kesehatan Otak.\n* Meningkatkan Kemampuan Tubuh Dalam Mengatasi Stress.\n* Menjaga Kesehatan Pencernaan.\n* Mencegah Batu Ginjal.<p>Khasiat Daun Sirsak dalam ace maxs.<p>Khasiat daun sirsak begitu berperan dalam membunuh sel-sel kanker. Ya, itulah obat kanker yang tak menguras biaya. Pohonnya terdapat di mana-mana, bahkan di pekarangan rumah Anda sekali pun.\nPara peneliti di AS, meneliti bahwa daun Graviola atau yang dikenal daun sirsak ini mengandung zat anti-kanker (Annonaceous Acetogenin). Zat ini mampu membunuh sel-sel kanker tanpa mengganggu sel-sel sehat di dalam tubuh.<p>Khasiat daun sirsak pun dapat dirasakan dalam obat herbal ace maxs karena obat herbal ace maxs ini salah satunya terbuat dari ekstra khasiat kulit manggis.\nTak hanya mengatasi penyakit kanker, daun sirsak pun berkhasiat untuk pengobatan sakit pinggang, bayi yang terkena mencret, ambeien, bisul, anyang-anyangan, sakit kandungan air seni, penyakit liver, eksim serta reumatik.<p>Ace Maxs memanfaatkan dua khasiat luar biasa daun sirsak dan kulit manggis yang sangat baik untuk penyakit kanker darah, karena kandungan kulit manggis kaya akan anti oksidan dan kemampuan daun sirsak yang 10.000 kali lebih baik dari kemoterapi menjadikan ace maxs sebagai solusi terbaik untuk atasi kanker darah. Selain itu masih ada bahan pendukung lainnya yakni Rosella hitam yang berfungsi sebagai pereda atau penetralisir keamanan sehingga aman untuk di konsumsi bagi yang memiliki masalah lambung dan madu murni yang berfungsi sebagai pemanis dan sebagai pengawet alami.<p>Bagi anda atau saudara anda yang sedang terkena penyakit kanker darah (leukimia) alangkah baiknya anda mencoba obat herbal ace maxs ini.<p>Untuk informasi pemesanan silahkan klik gambar di bawah ini.",1341589568

4208121,comment,4205553,4207989,2,0,refurb,,,"Right now what is happening is that companies are shifting their R&D efforts towards diseases that have relatively low regulatory barriers.  The best example is the shift out of diseases like diabetes (treatments are relatively effective, so safety standards are very high) into diseases like cancer (where treatment options are poor and safety standards are relatively low because patients die so quickly).<p>In the future I think it will be a combination of new technologies that allow drug makers to prove efficacy and safety in a more cost effective way.  I also think regulators will soften their hard-line stance on safety (in some areas).  The FDA has already started to do this.  Instead of saying ""that drug isn't proven safe"" they are saying ""that drug has been proven safe, but it helps a lot so maybe we'll allow the drug company to sell it to a few patients until we get more data"".<p>The current drug patent system isn't the best way to incentivise R&D investment, but all the other options out there seem worse right now.  You are correct, however, in saying that the costs associated with drug approval are often external to the company (the FDA).  So when you pay $300/month for a new drug, a lot of what you're paying for is an assurance of efficacy and safety (and the gov't agency that assures it's done right).",1341588110

This was 6 years ago, but the same guy was still subletting the same rooms for the same price, when last I spoke to him.<p>When I moved to the peninsula to work at Apple, I had a small house with a yard and fruit trees in the nice part of Menlo Park on a month-to-month lease for $1000/mo.  This was 4 years ago, but similar deals can definitely still be found (the same house was rented for $1300/mo recently).<p>Up to a year ago, my wife and I shared a lovely house with 1.5 acres in Palo Alto for $1800/mo, though we did need to sign a lease for that one.<p>When I travel back to the bay area now, I get an airbnb-type room in Palo Alto, and don't typically pay more than $800/mo short-term.  A lot of things are listed at higher rates, but you can often negotiate pretty successfully.  It certainly doesn't hurt to ask.<p>The ridiculous rents that you hear about in the bay area are partially due to a genuine real estate crunch, but they are largely also due to people having too much money and not enough sense.

The reason we don't have a system like that is because the politicians and regulators prefer it that way, banks have lobbied for an electronic system many times.<p>Second, note that Barclays was consistently filing reports with rates at the upper end of the LIBOR range if not the very highest.  Barclays was getting repeated messages through the British old boys network asking it to lower it's filings but was not heeding those calls, which given the pressure put on it was actually commendable behavior.  Instead Barclays was publicly pointing out to all who would hear that submissions by other banks were not credible.  There is now way for example that Citigroup or RBS was borrowing at lower rates than Barclays, yet they were consistently filing lower reports.  Note that during this time the regulatory playbook was all about trying to hide the symptoms of the crisis so that confidence would be restored.  Remember the genius move by the SEC to ban shorting of US financial stocks which was followed up by European regulators banning shorting of all stocks.<p>Finally, the assistant treasury secretary tells Bob Diamond that Barclays rates need not be at the upper end of the range consistently.  Now the only reason for a call like this is to give Diamond an order to lower rates with plausible deniability.<p>Note also that this whole ""scandal"" happened because senior Barclays management themselves found issues, hired an outside law firm to investigate and turned over all evidence to the FSA.  In light of this the UK serious fraud office wanted to investigate other banks but their funding was cut to prevent this so they abandoned the investigation.  The funding was only restored today after the funding cut threatened to become a bigger scandal.<p>Maybe we need to pay more attention to what the politicians are doing and less to what the bankers are doing?",1341587088

So having revenue of $0 is better than having revenue of $15000 (2nd number arbitrary just trying to illustrate that by showing a number you are likely to be judged differently then if you never charged at all and can point to eyeballs or signups and have the focus on that).",1341587026

The first person you run into when you show up will likely be projectile vomiting, or teabagging someone who passed out.

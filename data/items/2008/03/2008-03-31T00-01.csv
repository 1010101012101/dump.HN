150570,comment,150390,150501,0,0,ruslan,,,"Your assumption is totally false. I'm Russian and I can tell you that more than 80% of Russian pupils join universities (or a college) after 11 years of school. Standard university education program lasts for 5 years, after that you can join ""aspirantura"" (a post-gradute form of education) for another 4 years and only then you can earn some science degree. Doctor of Science is the highest degree which is usually earned at age of 50. On the opposite, the US's ""phD"" can be compared to the lowest possible degree here (no one will call/treat you as a scientist if you under 30). Russian academic system is very different from what you have in US or in EU. I believe same applies to Brazil and Argentina and many other post-soviet countries which blindly copied everything from Soviet Union system. So, it's very inaccurate to compare education level of countries that way as on the pic since there's still no unified standard adopted by them.<p>From my personal perceptions, I admit that more and more ppl here in Russia tend to get higher degrees, hence require higher sallaries. This causes a great problem in society - no one wants to clean streets and work on plants, everybody want to be bankers or at least some financial/oil tycoons. And programming/CS is considered as ""street cleaning"". :-(<p>PS: The only seemingly correct assumption that can be made based on the pic is that China, Brazil and India will stay the best ""outsource dirty work to"" countries at least for the next decade :-).",1206924765

The MacBook Pros are improved over the Powerbooks, but you're still dealing with lots of little jeweler's screws.  If that's not an issue, then I think Mac laptops are great.  Also, do not drop them on their hinges.  That won't necessarily break them, but they will get distorted and not close in exactly the same way again.<p>I also own an old Thinkpad T22.

We had 3 newer MBPs and a 1 yr old Lenovo X60 for 6 months in California. It seemed like the Macs were in and out of the shop constantly, experiencing all sorts of weird problems. Like most Apple products, the hardware is of mediocre quality and drastically overpriced, and the service is atrocious.<p>But you don't buy Apple comps for the hardware. If you like OSX better (and if you're programming, you most likely will) get a Macbook. Even with the troubles we had, our 3 programmers all agreed that they would not have switched back to Windows. We joked that we'd just keep an extra MBP on hand at all times, and honestly it's not such a bad idea.<p>Either way though I'd never buy a MBP refurb. That's just asking for trouble.",1206924354

(As that would be much better than simplistic types = bad but macros in general = good continuum)<p>The question is, how do you develop an aesthetic sense for these without say reading the research literature on both topics? I mean, it suffices to use the good examples of each for a while, pushing their strengths to the limit, but that at best gives folks a one dimensional view of the design of linguistic features, rather than a richer sense of strength, weaknesses, and tradeoffs.<p>As some other folks have mentioned, the other points are sort of irrelevant to the core of C#/++/java et al experience.<p>One point that seems to be missing is the (I think standard) point that interactively testing code by being able to interactively define or  execute functions is FANTASTIC for developing, because it facilitates (IMHO) an easier process of evolving the software",1206924047

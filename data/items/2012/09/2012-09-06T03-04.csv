4482780,comment,4482139,4482139,1,0,kls,,,"I would say the single most important rule that we ever put in place for our team which is completly distributed is that everything goes in the ticket system. No matter how small if it requires work, it goes into the ticket system. This ensures that there is a ticket out there that is being tracked, the project cannot be considered complete until all tickets are either dealt with or backlogged. Having a process built around a ticket system is instrumental to a process where things don't fall off the radar. A good deal of the ticket systems like JIRA integrate with the major IDE's, and most source control repositories can be configured to require a commit note. Many of the plugins integrate with source control to update the ticket at the same time you commit. Further some will even branch and merge just by clicking on a ticket and setting it's state to open. The point being with a little modeling of your process you can implement defect and feature tracking in a way that works with the natural flow of development. Doing so will patch a lot of the areas where information is leaking and not being captured.",1346903858

It's been, what, 4 years we've been in the ""HTML5 will save us all"" hype bubble?<p>Don't get me wrong; I am building a webapp and aspects of HTML5 have made my life far easier than if I were still in 2008. If I had hair I'd still be pulling it out due to the complexities of CSS (even with things like LESS) and subtle browser differences would turn the rest of it gray. But the current state of HTML+CSS+JS on the desktop is pretty good; compared.<p>We appear to be years away from a similar state in mobile. Between Safari's problems with no JIT support within apps and the fragmentation of Android, coupled with the monstrosity known as IE on WP7 (and WP8 and Win8), it is just not possible to use ""HTML5"" to build a great mobile experience (and reach a large audience).<p>My history in working with the W3C (I worked on HTML 3.2 and  4), and my understanding of the asymetric competitive nature of the major players (Apple, Google, Microsoft) makes me believe this situation is not going to radically improve anytime soon.<p>The upside is dev tool vendors who can help ease the pain should do pretty well (e.g. things like Xamarin (C#) and MoSync (C/C++/JavaScript))...",1346903620

It's true that cars depreciate in value at a ridiculous rate (which starts the moment you drive off from the dealership), but buying from a private seller means you have no way to tell if the car has been maintained properly. I've heard that a decent number of car owners don't even get oil changes on time. Is it worth saving, say, 30% up front but risking that the car will drop dead at any moment? Maybe yes and maybe no.

4482700,comment,4480877,4481395,1,0,kingmanaz,,,"Agreed. I'm a full time dvorak typist after years of having used qwerty. I re-learned vim's shortcuts for dvorak. The transition took approximately one month. My wrist used to ache after 10+ hours a day typing querty. The fire finally died after I switched and became comfortable with dvorak.<p>My first impression when revisiting qwerty is a revulsion at the placement of the ""t"". What a horrible location for such an oft used key. However, most qwerty users will have a similar response when typing ""ls -l"" on dvorak. Actually, a lot of unix commands were clearly written with qwerty in mind, their letters centering on qwerty's home row. The unix monikers get easier with repetition for dvorak typists, but dvorak's true power comes in writing English, which in my case is most of my typing. Vim works well with either layout, luckily. Most of the programming languages I use - SQL, golang, python, and c# - seem about the same in either layout.<p>Once you become fluent with dvorak it ""rolls"" off your fingers. You'll know what I mean once you're there. ""The"", ""another"", ""masticate"", ""friend"", and most other words with vowels and common consonants spend most of their typed lives on the home row. Both hands share evenly in typing. The common punctuation and quotes are right where you need them.<p>If you use RDP for most of your remote work the transition is surprisingly easy. Switching between layouts is simple in Windows and Unix. Hell, even my copy of Amiga 3.1 supports dvorak out of the box.<p>Some here seem to switch their keycaps to a dvorak arrangement. I did this in the past with my Model M but eventually set it back to querty. I'm not embarrassed to admit that I need to look at the keyboard now to type qwerty, thus having the keycaps set to querty serves as a convenient reminder. When typing dvorak I never look down.",1346901693

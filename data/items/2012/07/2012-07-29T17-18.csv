While I would have agreed with you a couple of years ago, the author's point that reCAPTCHA has reached a point where it isn't working nearly as well is spot on.  I myself fail on them about 75% of the time now -- quickly approaching the failure rate of computers.<p>For reCAPTCHA it used to be close to 100% success for me, but something has certainly changed with them, I don't know if it was intentional or is the result of a dwindling data set and as an end user, it doesn't matter, what matters is that they are really difficult to solve now.",1343584723

4309182,comment,4308760,4308999,24,0,ballooney,,,"It's very difficult to recreate mars on earth sufficiently (without bonkers expense) to thoroughly test at full scale, but there are some interesting ways you can get close.<p>For example, the parachutes that will be used on Mars deploy at a certain dynamic pressure, ambient pressure, mach number and mass ratio (the ratio of the payload mass to the mass of the air entrained by the parachute). All of these factors quite significantly affect the magnitude and the shape of force vs time profile of the parachute as it opens.<p>You care about this because the maximum force that a parachute generates is when it opens, higher than the equilibrium force it would generate under the same conditions, so that's the number you need to do the stress calculations on the entire landing system (and every gram is costing the tax payer a lot, so you can't really afford to just over engineer it to save some analysis).<p>You also care about this because at one ambient pressure a parachute might oscillate and corkscrew, at another ambient pressure it might form a stable glide (this has a lot to do with where the centre of gravity is of the payload and the air entrained by the payload). If you have a computer vision system calculating landing sites on your lander, you really don't a wobbly 'chute.<p>So, deploying in a wind tunnel isn't much use as that's at sea level pressure. You also can't really have more than a single-digit percent blockage of a wind tunnel by the test article (in cross sectional terms) otherwise the results are off because the air velocity round the parachute has to increase to maintain the mass flow through a smaller area. Big windtunnels are rare and expensive, big ones that'll do transonic and supersonic basically don't exist, big wind tunnels that will do transonic and supersonic at low pressures (Mars's atmosphere being about 1% the density of Earth's) just don't exist.<p>But we can do useful things on earth. Our atmosphere density decreases as you get higher to almost nothing. So at some point between sea level and space we can find at altitude that has the right ambient pressure. You can get a model of your lander, tow it above that altitude, to an altitude that you have calculated so that when you release it it will reach (in free-fall) the right mach number at the pressure-matched altitude.<p>This is done at full scale but it's still very expensive, requiring huge helium balloons over big ranges.<p>I was involved in a project which did exactly this, but on the cheap at sub-scale, when I was a student. If you're interested you can read the paper here: <a href=""http://www.cusf.co.uk/CUSF_AIAA_2011.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cusf.co.uk/CUSF_AIAA_2011.pdf</a><p>Of course, that's just the parachute!<p>As for the sky crane, there is no way to frame it that doesn't make it look extremely ambitious, it is. However, recall that the Mars Phoenix lander of 2008 used steered retrorockets to land successfully: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_(spacecraft)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_(spacecraft)</a><p>Recall secondly that the Spirit and Opportunity landers used a deploying tether to lower the airbag system away from the retrorockets. Step 8 on this page: <a href=""http://marsrover.nasa.gov/mission/tl_entry1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marsrover.nasa.gov/mission/tl_entry1.html</a><p>So, you can argue that the bits have been tested before on Mars, but of course putting them all together into a single system is a challenge in itself.<p>It will be fascinating to watch, a magnificent achievement if it works, admirably bold either way.",1343584639

For starters, many websites (eg Twitter) require email confirmation for new signups and password resets. This is not so different, the UX related commentary is superficial at best. After the initial activation / a reset you're back to cookie based auth, just like most sites.<p>Second, there is not a single mention of the biggest problem with passwords currently: the apparent inability of many sites to store them securely. I'll take this method of authentication over a password based one any day for probably 90% of the sites I have an account with currently. Especially sites like HN (not implying insecure password storage on HN - just saying for any forum based sites, it's more than adequate IMHO).",1343584621

4309174,comment,4308327,4309022,1,0,guscost,,,"Well to be honest, I'm not that far along into probably some of those same books myself, and I still get derailed by random curiosities and end up on Wikipedia or ordering a new book. The latest was a tangent into filter theory and digital signal processing, for a real-time audio project. It's hard to anticipate everything I should be able to do but I have some idea of the general order of things to study personally. If I needed to go in depth about Linear Algebra (and I definitely do), first I'd recall whatever I know about vectors and vector spaces, transformations and matrices and systems of equations, and start gathering articles and seeing if I'm missing any critical linked topics. After I get confident enough, I'd probably skip right to some textbook topic that caught my attention, say normed vector spaces, and try to make do with backward-skipping as a last resort.<p>Of course, that's just an artificial way of making the problem harder, basically, so that it's more interesting than safer but repetitive sets of exercises. The best way to  be interested, by far, is to actually want to solve some problem. For now, anyway, I heartily recommend looking for problems that these disciplines can solve, and choosing one to solve yourself.",1343584560
4309173,comment,4308327,4309052,3,0,sanxiyn,,,"I agree. More motivations, intuitions, insights behind fewer proofs would be more useful than lots of proofs, if the goal is to teach mathematical thinking, not to teach particular math results.<p>I think proofs are compressed because of lack of margins. Don't laugh! Authors seem to think they need to cover lots of essential results, and if you do motivations, intuitions, insights for all of them, already long math books will be impossible to hold in your hands. In my opinion the obvious solution is to omit most proofs and do far more non-formal discussion around important proofs. Which won't happen because their goal is to teach particular math results, not mathematical thinking, contrary to what they say.",1343584541

Being a (minor) part of that group, the event led me to create a new forum that was less dictatorial in its approach to moderation, as well as less intent on enforcing the silly minutae that dogged the former site.<p>Compared with the former forum, our own has a minuscule and stagnant userbase, but everyone is on a fist-name basis despite the absence of a naming policy.  Our last trolling incident was over a year ago, though arguments do occur.  There is always a conversation going on somewhere, and it's almost always entertaining.<p>I think the secret to the ""perfect"" community is a poison pill: you have to make sure it stays small; i.e. growth, and therefore success, has to be limited.
The more a community grows, the less familiar you are with everyone, and the less incentive you're going to have to be civil.  Unless you're an <i></i>*hole, people don't generally randomly insult people they consider to be their friends.<p>I don't think this is exclusive to online communities, but all societies, in general, as seen in the big city/little town dynamic/trope.

This stems from the fact that the vast majority of current Internet usage (a ""high 90% level of traffic"") consists of data being disseminated from a source to a number of users.<p>The contemporary Internet architecture revolves around a host-based conversation model, created in the 1970s to allow geographically distributed users to use a few big, immobile computers.

They are using the Internet as another broadcasting method and ignoring the potential it offers.<p>At a very basic level, they could offer live streaming of all events --advertising free-- for a fee.  I would gladly pay, say, US $100 for this service.  Some might only be interested in a subset of events, which means that there's a possibility to create tiers and capture revenue at various levels.<p>Here in the US, as has been discussed in this and other threads, NBC has royally fucked up things beyond all recognition.  I finally broke down and downloaded their app.  It's shit.  The ads are intrusive TV-style ads.  What's worst, they have some sort of a bug somewhere that is causing videos to end prematurely.<p>As and example, I tried watching Archery, Judo and Taekwondo pre-recorded events (not live).  One of them was supposed to be a five hour event.  We watched about fifteen minutes and the stream stopped with a message that read something akin to ""This video has ended"".  There was no way to watch it beyond that point.  It literally stopped in the middle of the action.<p>The other moronic thing is the way the video ads are inserted.  They seem to be using a simple timer to determine when to run a video ad.  This means that they'll interrupt your viewing in the middle of a match --just as someone is throwing a kick-- to run a stupid ad.  Unbelievable.<p>I am hoping that there's widespread dissatisfaction with this and that the next Olympics, World Cup, etc.  see a massive change.  I'd really like to see a true Internet company get the rights and do it right.  The IOC could make far more than what NBC and others are paying for these events by having a single-point internationally-friendly Internet strategy rather than old-school per country/region licensing.<p>Finally, a note to NBC advertisers:  I am NOT watching your ads.  Stop paying NBC!  We DVR the coverage and are masterfully skilled at fast-forwarding through your commercials. When I am watching gymnastics I could not care less about your movie or your insurance offering.  So, stop supporting broadcasters, you are wasting your money in a monumental way.",1343582781

Even if right now the japanese are trying to reduce their consumption, by approx 15%, it won't be sufficient on the long term for the japanese industry to remain competitive. I am already seeing big japanese company de-localizing.
In the building where I work (in japan), they installed solar panels on the roof, but these panel only provide like less than 10% of the power need in the best case ( and even less for the rest of the day, and it is not like we use high powered laser, nor particle collider).<p>So if japanese wants to live without nuclear power, that would be with a growing national debt, a faltering industry, and huge sacrifice in lifestyle.

Domains are so cheap to keep around, squatters only need to profit on a small percentage of them to keep a large number of them on hand. If a squatter lets go of one, another squatter will simply pick it up.<p>I'll give you an example: When I was in high school in the late 90's, I registered my last name as a domain name (uresk.com). At some point (1999, I think) I couldn't afford the registration fee (~$35 per year back then, I think) and had to drop it, thinking I'd pick it back up later. Ever since then, the domain has bounced around various squatters and is to this day unavailable to me. There is no way they are making any money off this domain name:<p>- I have an incredibly uncommon last name that is shared by maybe only a thousand or fewer people in the world.<p>- The .net version of the domain name (which I own) gets only a few thousand visitors per year.<p>- The sites run on the .com version have never had anything but parking pages up.<p>The only reason the domain name keeps getting registered is because of the criteria that someone owned it before. I'd be shocked if the domain name became available in my lifetime. I see this same situation played out whenever I go to find a new domain for a business idea I have - all of the decent domains are just be squatted on, and the only way to get them is to pay insane fees to squatters.<p>So, no - the problem isn't going to resolve itself.",1343582280

If rss had discussion or comment capability, it might be reasonably compared to usenet, but rss has nothing in common with usenet as it stands, it's a one-way protocol, I subscribe, or I publish, there's no discussion, as there is with usenet. In that it's open, with no single gatekeeper, it is no different to http, but comparing rss to http would also be pointless.",1343582028

That way squatters go away. Of course this is just variation on what search engines do right now, so it will never take. Too much hassle for not enough gain.

Mainly because the process switch involves changing the VM address space, which means a TLB shootdown: all that hard-earned cache has to be fetched from DRAM again. You also pay a higher cost in synchronization: every message shared between processes requires crossing the kernel boundary. So not only do you have a higher memory use for shared structures and higher CPU costs for serialization, but more cache churn and context switching.<p><i>it's all serialization - but that's not a bottleneck for most web servers.</i><p>I disagree, especially for a format like JSON.

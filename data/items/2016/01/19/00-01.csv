To take an obvious and down-to-earth example, let&#x27;s say we &quot;solve&quot; logistics in the sense that we can transport things wherever we want, timely and cheaply. That would help us with a lot of the problems we are facing, such as hunger. And for solving logistics we essentially need the same skills we need as for solving game-playing.",1453165155

You appear to be targeting businesses, educators, designers, organizers, writers, web developers, logistics planners, therapists, and probably more that didn&#x27;t fit on the screen. If you&#x27;re a one man band, you&#x27;re better off picking a really targeted niche that the existing players in the project management space find too small to care about.

I&#x27;m in a very similar situation (congenital profound hearing loss, implanted in left ear at 16), but in a country (Japan[1]) where the primary language is not my native language (English).<p>> The biggest hurdle in most cases is communication, especially in meetings. That being said, I still do fine in them, because I rely on lip reading as well as vocal cues/context, but I also rely on my coworkers to be understanding from time to time, and they are.<p>I definitely concur with this. Meetings can be a pain depending on the environment (for example, some people prefer to meet in cafes etc. since meeting space is at a premium here). Body language (looking away, looking down, mumbling into hands, hiding face in papers, etc.) can also make meetings incredibly hard. The hardest part for me, personally, is the sheer stamina required to be &quot;always on&quot; and track everyone&#x27;s eyes to make sure I know who&#x27;s talking (in a meeting of ~15-20 people) so I can look that way and try to read their lips.<p>Telephone communication is also a big problem. No matter how often I tell people about my disability or how quickly I respond to e-mails/chats, they will still insist on calling me for &quot;urgent&quot; things. [Edit: Sometimes I think I should deal with this by simply ignoring all phone calls, but practically speaking I&#x27;d rather not exacerbate a potential emergency by not responding. The counterargument is that I could exacerbate an emergency by responding and not understanding ~50% of the content of the call...] My theory is that because I&#x27;m largely functional in person, they still subconsciously expect me to be able to use a phone normally.<p>> this usually comes up around the topic of phone interviews, I can&#x27;t do them. People appreciate this<p>Interesting. I almost always have the opposite reaction; people try to be accommodating, but it&#x27;s almost always still focused around doing voice via electronic connections rather than the text format I request. &quot;What if we use a normal telephone? What if we use VoLTE? What if we use Skype instead? What if we get you a headset? What if we use Skype video or Facetime?&quot;<p>> I&#x27;ve never had the situation where the job/culture/people fit was there but it didn&#x27;t happen because of a communication issue.<p>Same here. For me, typically if it&#x27;s a communication issue, it&#x27;s because the people/culture weren&#x27;t interested in being accommodating.<p>[1]  As a side note, Japanese is extremely hard to lip read because it doesn&#x27;t use the upper lip much, or at all in some dialects. There&#x27;s also a lot of cultural stuff that makes life difficult: masks (either prevention or because the speaker is sick), the tendency to cover the mouth, and the tendency to not look at other people during meetings or when having a confrontation -- when communication is really important.",1453165029

10928170,comment,10927600,10927843,0,0,Ensorceled,,,"One: Google+ was a terrible interface, in that it tried to force a &quot;programmers&quot; thought pattern on the user.  Circles? OOP in disguise. It looked enough like Facebook that the different, and far more complex, behaviours were confusing to people.  Switching would be painful.  You may have liked it but most people did not.<p>Two: G+ kept trying to hook into everything Google did.  My Youtube account with all my embarrassing 80s playlists and WoW videos and cats and ... WTF?  NO I DON&#x27;T WANT TO SHARE THAT. Pretty much every time I logged in I had to say &quot;No I really don&#x27;t want to do that&quot; until they finally snuck it through at some point.  Many people just weren&#x27;t interested in establishing a network with somebody who didn&#x27;t understand privacy at all and kept changing the rules for existing services.  Coupled with previous missteps, I&#x27;m looking at you Buzz, this was a deal breaker for many.  Facebook has a bad reputation but at least they are not trying to surface embarrassing info from other sources.<p>Three: Google+ was tech heavy from the start, which meant it tended to drift &quot;professional&quot; and be considered &quot;for the geeks&quot;.  Friends and family were already connected to me on FB, G+ tended to be old colleagues who weren&#x27;t close enough to be connected on Facebook.  I just don&#x27;t have much to share with those people that I&#x27;m not already sharing on LinkedIn.  For a social network, geeky early adopters is NOT a recipe for success.<p>Four:  Google+ started making other services worse.  Youtube comments were a disaster and seriously broke content creators ability to have a dialog with their audience. Google Reader was gutted and eventually shutdown.  New services were artificially hooked into G+ for no real reason. Basically, G+ became the punching bag for problems in it&#x27;s other products.",1453164980

A CRM is not just a solution to a different business problem but also a logically different layer from a development perspective. You would have to build it as a product that sits on top of the database product.<p>But as a CRM system it has no value to the end customer unless it has a certain minimum level of functionality. So although you can add features gradually and evolve your CRM offering you will not have a single customer until you have actually added enough features that make it actually usable. Nobody will buy your gradually evolving system until several years have passed and it works for some actual customers. In which case you have already spend alot of money and effort.",1453164852

I am obviously lacking some perspective, but my advanced and AP math and science classes in high school were always very split by boys and girls. The upper echelon of students in those courses, of which I was consistently part of, were moreso women than men.<p>But when I look at what my old classmates are doing now, most of those girls went into teaching, law, and business related roles. A couple went into science and engineering and one is a dentist. Of the guys, most of them became doctors, engineers, and pharmacists and a couple work in agriculture and wildlife conservation. All of the women I am referring to know they are smart enough to do whatever they want, but they obviously decided to favor non-technical roles for their own reasons.",1453164814

The fluid UI, iOS foundation, app store and federated search means it&#x27;s automatically a superior product to competitors such as Roku or Fire TV.<p>And it is a very nice package. It&#x27;s very smooth. Apps like Plex and Netflix are a bit rough, but now they have a good foundation to build on, and the app store will change the amount of competition in this space - already there are three competing Plex clients, for example.<p>I was in the same boat, by the way: I bought the 2nd gen AppleTV, tried to like the 3rd gen, but it was slow and generally terrible. Same with competing products. I bought them and ended up not using them. The new AppleTV I&#x27;m actually using. It helps that I have it hooked up to Plex. Unlike the old Plex client you could install into a jailbroken 2nd/3rd-gen AppleTV, is actually very usable.",1453164699

No credit card required.&#x27; subtext to the sign-up call to action. It may be just me, but when someone explicitly states there&#x27;s no risks, it makes me consider that there might be risks. No need to put doubts into someones mind.<p>- Love the interface, really intuitive (Just thought that needed its own point)<p>- I think the permanent call to action to &#x27;Upgrade Today&#x27; on the dashboard view is a little too in your face, and takes up a fair amount of real-estate which.<p>- The &#x27;Add a member&#x27; option could also do with having a &#x27;Add a team member&#x27; option (it may have it on the paid tiers, but for the free tier it would be a good call to action to upgrade)<p>- The difficulty field on a ticket doesn&#x27;t seem like it intuitively will make sense for all tasks, perhaps as an optional field, or allow users to customise the names and values of the fields at the project level. I.e. if instead of high, medium and low priority, I wanted &#x27;Later, Soon, Now and Yesterday&#x27; for my priorities.<p>- I think the Project Tasks and My Tasks could be collapsed into one column, freeing more space to work with, or maybe even a dedicated create task column. Just a filter of &#x27;show my tasks&#x27; or &#x27;show all tasks&#x27; would work well. Especially on the free tier it&#x27;s a lot of wasted space.<p>- I&#x27;d shy away from using points and other metrics like that, as most of the time a 1-3 or even 1-8 scoring system becomes restrictive and not representative of the time taken to do a task, over time it just loses meaning to a user in my opinion.<p>And a minor issue or two:<p>- If I have two tasks assigned to a project, one high priority and difficult, the other low priority and easy and I complete the high priority task the &#x27;Tasks Completed&#x27; in the project overview jumps to 75%, which isn&#x27;t what i&#x27;d expect.<p>- The text on the &#x27;Time Elapsed&#x27; and &#x27;Tasks Completed&#x27; seems centred on the progress bar and not the container, and the small white font makes it hard to see.<p>- You can&#x27;t access any of the support / terms of use etc.. without first logging out of your account.<p>Aside from that all I&#x27;d do is iterate a little bit on the text of the website, as it just doesn&#x27;t quite bite yet.<p>But all in all, very good work.

Also, every time my generic remote can&#x27;t do something, I find myself powering up the wireless keyboard and using a not-made-for-the-living-room UI to do everything. The other day my video started stuttering for no reason and I spent about an hour troubleshooting, upgrading video drivers, etc. I&#x27;ve never had to do this with an AppleTV or WDTV or FireTV stick, or any other appliance. Then a week later, the sound stopped working through my TV. I went into audio drivers, and I saw a RealTEK driver. Is this what I want? I don&#x27;t know. Why did it work before? It doesn&#x27;t work now. After a few reboots, magically I saw &quot;Samsung TV&quot;. Well, okay, I DEFINITELY want that.

All of the mentioned examples, I mean every single one, indicate a business trying to force its way into the higher level through business channels.  For example, when a business wants into a higher level they make it a business priority to create a new product and attempt to drive the priorities of this next level product through their business objectives.  That is an epic fail.<p>It is important to instead concede that you don&#x27;t know the needs of the consumers in the higher level, and if you think you do it is because you are guessing.  The only way avoid the problem is to not attempt to move into the higher level, at least not intentionally and not through business priorities.<p>This is extremely counter-intuitive because there are generally fewer expenses and greater market frequency at each higher level, which means superior revenue potential.  Businesses exist to make money and to ignore moving up to the higher level means denying this potential (vast) revenue source.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t move into the higher level of the stack and be really good at it.  It just means you cannot do so both intentionally and as a business objective.<p>The solution is to double-down on where you already are with what you are already good at and focus on product quality of your existing products.  Continue to improve where you are already good.  Improvements and enhancements to existing products can gradually yield the next level as the improvements progressively open new potential in an evolutionary fashion.  While getting to the next level this way is much slower it is also risk reduced and continues to associate your brand with quality and consume satisfaction.<p>This will only work, though, if the goal is improving the current product and not acquiring revenue in that desired higher level.  Think evolution and not revolution.  It has to be a gradual, almost accidental, increase of capability based on meeting current consumer needs.",1453163655

Back in 2013 the WSJ published a report listing eleven flights through Newark which had landed on the chronically-delayed list for 8 consecutive months or more. The only carrier with more chronically-delayed flights than United... is Spirit. And that&#x27;s saying something (they&#x27;re also typically the only airline with worse overall on-time performance than United).<p>Granted, a lot of that is from affiliates running small regional jets under the &quot;United Express&quot; brand -- though mainline United was still dead last in on-time performance among the big three legacy US carriers in Q3 2015 -- but in turn that&#x27;s mostly ripple effects of the way United manages its regionals and shops out as much flying as possible to them (in Q3 2015, Delta operated 233,000 flights, American operated 234,000 and United only 133,000; over the same time period ExpressJet, which does regional operations for all three but primarily for United, operated over 142,000 flights, and SkyWest which has over half its flying as United Express operated over 152,000 flights), which in turn was thanks to a major strategy (slashing mainline operations in the name of &quot;capacity discipline&quot;) of the previous Smisek-led management at United.",1453162131

Their penetration here is low and even when they do have the jobs listed, they just link back to the original site where you have to fill out a long employment application.",1453161703

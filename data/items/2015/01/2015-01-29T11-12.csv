The fear of terrorism is a lot more substantial at their points in life.<p>I don&#x27;t know about discourse in France -  I can imagine that hell just broke loose after the recent attacks. Here in Germany, it&#x27;s very much a generation problem. Those who care about civil rights and an active democracy are young, and young educated people are a minority. Old people are heavily catered to by the governing parties, and they all seem to love surveillance, most being lucky enough to never have experienced the downsides.<p>This fight feels a lot like the gay rights movement.

You truly will want to stop at some point, even if it causes no issues in your life (good luck with that!) -- every addict I&#x27;ve known has hit that point eventually. I did.

It takes rational thought out of the occasion, changes your personality and your goals - your life becomes about getting your next fix and you&#x27;ll do anything to get it.<p>Beer, weed, ecstacy, etc don&#x27;t have that same steep addictive power, so aren&#x27;t dangerous in that way. So it can&#x27;t be so easily compared to alcohol since alcohol has a much more gradual addiction curve whereas heroin is much much steeper.",1422531258

Open source projects tend to attract very opinionated people, and a project&#x27;s infancy is when it&#x27;s most fragile. Usually the objections come from the outside, but at Mozilla the critics are the core volunteers who (publicly) question weather project decisions are aligned with the manifesto [0] all the time. It&#x27;s also seen as inappropriate when someone tries to develop something in private and then release it expecting it to be shielded from criticism because it&#x27;s more polished than a prototype.<p>All of this means you can&#x27;t get away with shady stuff, or cool stuff that doesn&#x27;t align with the project. But products need to evolve to stay competitive, and the downside is that the added friction from having to respond to people who are not in the payroll about what to develop and what to release means Firefox doesn&#x27;t have the capacity to move as fast as Chrome does, for example.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto/</a>",1422530058

I ran two businesses (one successfully), held down excellent jobs for amazing agencies, built cool stuff, had numerous relationships that were both good and bad.<p>Most of heroin&#x27;s issues arise because of its illegality, coupled with its price. I was spending $400 a day. It&#x27;s nearly impossible to keep afloat with that sort of outgoing expense. Heroin also makes me grumpier than I typically am, and I wouldn&#x27;t wish the withdrawals on my worst enemy.<p>But on the other hand, it has few negative physical effects in the long term, which I find amazingly curious. I&#x27;ve been clean for three years now, and if I didn&#x27;t tell you you&#x27;d never know what I&#x27;d done. That&#x27;s odd, in my opinion, considering its reputation. If I&#x27;d drunk the equivalent amount of alcohol every day for six years, I&#x27;d doubt that would be the case.<p>Like any drug, being illegal distorts the market and causes issues that wouldn&#x27;t exist with it legal, however I would never want to see it legal the same way alcohol is.

I read your comments and wanted to share a little bit more of that particular experience:<p>- I shouldn&#x27;t have been driving, and I regret that accident to this day. Even though I&#x27;m responding so much better to treatment now, and at points I have tried to start driving again, at this point I am not driving. Virginia (the author) asked if I plan to drive again soon and I don&#x27;t. It feels like the fastest way for me to cause harm to others is getting behind the controls of a vehicle :( I wish I had worked this out sooner and without an accident. I mostly walk or rely on public transport or lifts with friends now, although on my better days I ride a push bike when I can stick mostly to cycle paths.<p>- Speed and my poor cognition were the main factors in the accident. It was my fault entirely. I was trying to catchup with friends who had left on the trip a few minutes before me. The older woman was traveling slowly in the far left lane and came over to the far right lane to do a U-turn at a signed U-Turn point. I don&#x27;t remember her indicating or checking her blind spot, but that is &quot;normal&quot; behaviour on Thai roads and given my speed wouldn&#x27;t have helped any. After the motorbike collision we both got to the side of the road. Several vehicles stopped and helped us pull our bikes off the road too. The police arrived, as did paramedics, and she received first aid at the scene and was taken to hospital. My understanding is that in Thailand the Kingdom provides healthcare for people involved in traffic accidents. It&#x27;s funded from vehicle registration I think. The Police took my ID and the police requested money to pay for her damaged motorbike, which I paid. I saw them hand it to the woman directly so I don&#x27;t think it was a bribe. The article makes it read like my thoughts immediately went to myself, they didn&#x27;t, they went to dealing with the immediate situation. The thoughts and reflection about what had happened came later.<p>- There&#x27;s lots of things I would have done differently if I had known this condition was in my future. I definitely would have stopped driving sooner. I also would have communicated my health better to the people around me. For a long time I had the belief that, &quot;they&#x27;ll find what is wrong and I&#x27;ll get better&quot;. I didn&#x27;t expect that they would find out what is wrong and it would continue to be a permanent ongoing condition. Because of that I strung people along by saying I would be able to do things &quot;soon&quot;, when in reality I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to. At that point in my life I didn&#x27;t appreciate yet just how much this was impacting my ability to do &quot;normal&quot; things.<p>- Traffic accidents seem very common for people with Idiopathic Hypersomnia. A year~ ago someone shared that they were in a traffic accident where they fatally injured a pedestrian. Others have stories of leaving the highway at speed in single vehicle accidents. It&#x27;s common for further medical investigations after accidents like that to lead to a diagnosis. It really sucks, especially for those who haven&#x27;t done anything wrong who get injured/killed.<p>Thanks for reading the article and discussing it. I hope the article helps raise awareness about this condition and allows people to receive diagnosis faster and prevents things like this happening more often.",1422529274

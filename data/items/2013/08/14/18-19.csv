Simply because I can&#x27;t afford it, or place a high value on the cost I&#x27;m now at a disadvantage to another applicant. To borrow from another HN comment, it&#x27;s akin to entering a cheat code while I&#x27;m just here normally playing the game. While I don&#x27;t mind cheating in single player games, this is akin to wallhacking in a FPS.<p>Having said that, I also don&#x27;t mind it at all because if I get a job this way it proves I did so on my own merit and those that paid were complete suckers. There is definitely a sense of achievement that comes with that.<p>I will always wonder how this came about though. How this became acceptable.

6213482,comment,6211492,6212900,8,0,clicks,,,"I underwent a formal psychological evaluation a few years ago, my shrink informed me that I have incredibly bad memory (I was ranking in at 1-2 percentile for two or three different memory tests). But yet, I&#x27;ve also been able to memorize pi to about 50 digits, I&#x27;ve memorized the entire periodic table, and I&#x27;ve memorized whole poems in Latin (despite knowing very little Latin).<p>The thing I&#x27;ve found to be true in my case is that I do have bad memory in general -- but this is because of the unique childhood I had: I was never forced to memorize anything. I&#x27;ve a habit of referencing my smartphone when I need to know what someone&#x27;s phonenumber is, I&#x27;ve a habit of looking at address books and maps to know where someone is, instead of making a concerted effort to think where they live beforehand. My brother-in-law is the opposite of me: he purposely avoids using his smartphone/GPS, and instead looks at Google Maps directions before taking off for the trip... and relies on it with memory. I asked him why he did that instead of just using the GPS that he does have and he straight up told me he does these things for memory exercises. So now, at least for the past few months, I&#x27;ve also been making a concerted effort in improving my memory and I&#x27;ve found that I can do these incredible things... I can memorize pi to 100 digit, I can memorize pages of books that are in a language I barely understand -- despite my shrink telling me that I have terrible memory.<p>So I don&#x27;t think 300bps&#x27;s comment was offensive at all. Memory is very much a skill that can be improved with dedicated effort. I&#x27;m someone who long believed until recently that I had bad memory and I had to deal with it... but this is not true, I can do mental exercises to improve it. Research has proved time and again that learning new languages, new musical instruments, etc. are great exercises to keep the mind/memory sharp. I implore you to look into the idea: use little tricks, read the book &quot;Moonwalking with Einstein&quot; (it&#x27;s about memorizing things in fun ways), take about a week to memorize digits of pi (spend about 10 hours, I&#x27;d say -- use various techniques (which you can read up on online)), and get back to us. See if you truly can or can&#x27;t memorize pi to the 50th (or even 100th) digit if you really put the effort to it. The more you do it, the more your ability will improve. If it takes you 5 hours the first time around to remember some 50 digits, it&#x27;ll take you just one hour the next 50th time you do it.",1376506517

An entry level programmer is paid no better than an entry level police officer or fireman, and will probably make less when you count overtime and benefits of gov&#x27;t jobs.<p>2. A first year lawyer at a top firm like Fenwick will make $160k+$40k bonus his first year, which seems to be roughly the top for a very experienced programmer.  Sure there are those few level 6+ at Google that pull in 300k+ total comp, but they are statistically insignificant.<p>3. Companies like Apple and Google have tens of billions of dollars in cash and make equal amounts in profits every year, largely by exploiting the very high margins they get off of their engineers (see revenue/employee stat compared to total comp stats).<p>4. Considering the high CoL where we live and work, an average engineer will never be able to afford a decent house and will resort to renting or long commutes.  Meanwhile, even below average doctors, average lawyers, cops, firefighters, finance guys, etc will easily be able to afford one.<p>Are the engineering salaries being deflated by all the H1Bs?  Why do engineers put up with this?  For the relative value we add, Engineers should start at $120k+30% bonus right out of college and should be making $250-300k base + bonus with 5-10 years of experience.  Top engineers should pull 7 digit salaries just like top finance guys.<p>I&#x27;m no top engineer, but I graduated with an M.S. in computer science and my first job in 2011 was at $85,000.  Meanwhile a cop with no college degree makes a minimum of $89,000 + overtime: http://www.sf-police.org/index.aspx?page=1655",1376506201

Such is the magic of the C++ standard ;)<p>There is a part of the C++ standard that says something along the lines of: the compiler may assume that every program will eventually exhibit some side-effect. That part of the standard also explicitly states that this is intended to allow compilers to remove loops with empty bodies (or bodies with only dead code) even if they cannot prove termination of the loop. See e.g. page 14 of <a href=""http://isocpp.org/files/papers/N3690.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://isocpp.org/files/papers/N3690.pdf</a><p>This is certainly useful when you think of code that is created indirectly via macros and/or template instantiation. Whether compilers actually perform this &quot;optimization&quot; on explicit endless loops like for(;;); is another question, but at least C++ can claim to be able to run certain endless loops in under a second ;)",1376506179

Something I never thought about before seriously considering the Leaf. All in all &quot;very expensive&quot; seems like a great injustice to the Leaf. It&#x27;s not competing against a 500 for my dollar. It&#x27;s competing against VW&#x27;s and Volvos. It comes out with a lower payment, zero maintenance expenses (no oil, and I&#x27;ve always used Mobil1 so that&#x27;s $100 pop), no engine air filter, no transmission fluid, no accessory belts, and it&#x27;s cheaper to &quot;fill up&quot; than even the most efficient small car, while being a lot more fun to drive than most (especially if the comparisons are narrowed to high-efficiency gas vehicles).<p>For me the Leaf doesn&#x27;t compete with Fiestas and Aveos. It competes with Volvo C3&#x27;s, VW Golfs, etc. It&#x27;s got an average MSRP in that range and much lower cost of ownership.<p>Frankly, I just don&#x27;t see mounting a serious argument on a cost basis (as long as the tax credits still apply at least) without having a big blind-spot for the European imports in the same category to be honest.",1376506172

Having lived through the complete gentrification (Disneyfication) of Manhattan I found that, despite being of the Liberal bent, it was hard to see old neighborhoods disappear, look around at nice neighborhoods and realize a good percentage of the apartments are owned by people who are in them only a few days a year, and watch as the interesting fringe stuff (i.e. The Hat) was replaced by the interesting mega-expensive stuff (i.e. Per Se.)

It&#x27;s integrated in the workflow.\n2) You choose your own reviewers.\n3) We have had a clear message, that code review is about communication, knowledge sharing and bug hunting is just an added bonus. And communication is always our biggest problem in big projects. Just by letting someone do code review of your changes, the knowledge inside the organization about the change has almost doubled.\n4) We ask people to treat code review request as number one priority, as the changes can not get in before it.<p>Before Gerrit we tried to encourage the culture by using Reviewboard [2], but in our case it just wasn&#x27;t used that much. People did not treat review request as a high priority. Maybe because it was not enforced and sometimes you&#x27;d do a review for a change that the developer already merged in.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to see how small tricks can change peoples behaviour...<p>[1] <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.reviewboard.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reviewboard.org/</a>",1376505173

This has a big effect on morale: the developing team has a series of short development bursts ending with an achievement and the vision of the company in eyesight. The quality of the product tends to be higher sheerly out of being simpler.<p>A small idea can have very wide reach, and can be an essential need to users, or a new pillar of infrastructure. Often after building a small and strong product, a company has the freedom to apply and maximize it for the full range of possible use cases. The easy example is Google, but I like to use the StackExchange network. They started with a Q&A site for software engineers, and once that was successful they expanded to a huge range of fields.<p>Huge ideas often send startups down a path to failure. Morale gets drained over time as features get completed but the vision remains too far away. Complexity increases greatly, and the core product gravitates to unmanageability as it grows. Even a best in class engineering team can be toppled by the exponential complexity of a large product, there&#x27;s a potter&#x27;s field of large products being built by awesome engineers, in big companies and small.<p>I could go on and on for each side, but the main point is, having a company vision that is the MVP is amazingly powerful, and opposite, having a company vision that is massive even with an MVP that is a stepping stone on the way to the massive vision, is a swamp to trudge through for years.",1376504890

Lyft isn&#x27;t even a <i>thing</i> here in NYC, and Uber is barely on anyone&#x27;s radar - <i>because we have working mass transit</i>. These are only &quot;real problems&quot; because MUNI and BART represent the transit savviness of a wet paper bag. I used to spend more than a NYC subway monthly pass&#x27;s cost on Ubers when I lived in SF every month, because the transit in that city is so utterly and completely fucked. Even among my social circles of relatively-highly-paid tech-workers, none of us have used Uber more than once or twice.<p>To be blunt, Uber and Lyft are solutions to the problem that <i>San Francisco can&#x27;t get its shit together to save its life</i>.<p>Others in this thread mention that if the investment made in private company shuttles were poured into the public transit system then everyone could benefit. It would be nice, but I don&#x27;t think this is actually true - the problem with MUNI, Caltrain, and BART isn&#x27;t due to lack of funding, it&#x27;s due to extensive corruption and mismanagement. At the agency level, at the municipality level, and at the regional level. Google could&#x27;ve thrown truckloads of cash at them and it would&#x27;ve disappeared into the ether with little to show for it.<p>I don&#x27;t blame Google, Facebook, and Apple for running their own shuttles. It was the most rational, least evil choice in response to a fundamental governmental dysfunction. The protest against the growing divide is a red herring - the divide largely exists and is perpetuated by a woefully incompetent and corrupt city government.<p>There is a growing collection of startups whose primary purpose is fixing SF/Bay Area dysfunction - Uber and Lyft being among them. I&#x27;m disappointed at how revolutionary people seem to think they are, when they seem more like they&#x27;re solving problems that shouldn&#x27;t exist in a competent, working city, in a highly exclusive and upmarket way. Transportation is horrifyingly broken and people can&#x27;t get around? Solution: upmarket shiny black sedans priced completely out of reach for everyone except the monied techno-elite.

Point me to one compiler which does this <i>intentionally</i> (ie not a bug) and I would stand corrected, but in most cases most compiler experts I know (myself included) would frown and disapprove. There was a bug in GCC a while ago to that effect, but it&#x27;s been corrected since.<p>Why: Computationally, there is no difference between &quot;no code&quot; and &quot;a loop that iterates 100 times and does nothing&quot;. It is thus correct to eliminate the latter to preserve the observable behaviour. However, a loop that <i>never terminates</i> is a very different thing entirely: it says &quot;execution will never progress past this point&quot; and everything afterwards will never be reached. This property is so enshrined in theoretical computer science that any half-decent verification tool will consider what comes after the loop as dead code and not check it. In the newer GCC and Clang the code <i>after</i> a never-ending loop will be marked &quot;unreachable&quot; and be killed as dead code.<p>So removing a never-ending loop would be quite the big deal indeed.<p>Technical note: specifically in C and C++ and every language implemented using them, a loop with a counter but no check on the upper bound (eg. &quot;for(i = 0; ; ++i)&quot; ) is very different from the empty loop discussed above. Such a loop would be called &quot;undefined behavior&quot;: the program may or may not stop, the world may explode, etc. This is because C and C++ say that overflow has undefined behavior. So this kind of loop does not mean &quot;the programmer intends the control flow to terminate here&quot;, but rather &quot;the programmer is playing with fire and it can burn&quot;.",1376503842

The paper I looked at was in turn about brute force attacks. So essentially this paper is arguing that analysis of brute force attacks must necessarily account for the non-uniform structure of the source distribution.<p>On the surface it seems like this only really effects things which rely on treating these types of distributions. It is difficult for me to say how this effects the analysis of primitives when using keys derived from user input. In practice I don&#x27;t think it makes much difference as we are already getting quite good at exploiting the distributions from which people seem to draw passwords.

Like I said, it&#x27;s common among large corporations, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a fact that it&#x27;s happening. Google&#x27;s tax avoidance schemes are well documented, whatever your opinion of them is morally there&#x27;s no use denying they exist.<p>The broader point I was making isn&#x27;t Google Is Evil For Not Paying Taxes. The point was, if you&#x27;re going to not pay taxes, you don&#x27;t get to play the &quot;I&#x27;m a benevolent corporation helping make society a better place&quot; card when you run enormous luxury coaches all over town and use sketchy pick up locations. People will assume the worst intentions.<p>I actually lean Google on this one. But that doesn&#x27;t mean I have to buy the argument they are doing this out of the kindess of their Googler hearts. I say make them pay through the teeth for these stops like any red blooded capitalist would. (Like, say, Milton Friedman.)",1376503427

I&#x27;m currently playing around with it whenever I find some spare time. I don&#x27;t see it as a competitor to R, I think it could well be something along the lines of Python or Go.\nIt is LLVM based, and already really fast even though it is still a 0.2 and the JIT seems to have a lot of room for optimisation.\nWhats more, it seems to offer just the right blend of language features: - Easily include C libraries via a simple ffi [1] - It is homoiconic like Lisp and thus allows for fantastic macro facilities [2]\n- It has solid parallel programming support via a Coroutines implementation (Tasks) (similar to Goroutines as far as I can tell)\n- It is a non-pure functional language\n- In contrast to Go it has generics, so functional constructs like map, apply, drop, reduce, fold, partition & friends are already in there (or can easily be implemented) [3]\n- It has optional types, so that you can assign types and the compiler will check for it and mark errors and will be able to create optimised code, but you don&#x27;t have to [4]\n- Running external programs is a joy [5] (Example: a=readall(`echo hello`))\nThe community seems to be very alive. There&#x27;s a simple web framework called &quot;Morsel&quot; and I&#x27;ve recently set it up against a couple of contenders from the web framework benchmark (cpoll-cppsp, phreeze, and some others), and even though it is still a version 0.2, the performance for the json serialization benchmark would be pretty close to Scalatra (I yet have to publish these numbers, will do so soon).\nI really hope that Julia will grow, as I love the choices that went into the design of the language, and it would be a shame if it would be only a replacement for R instead of something much bigger, as it is such a nice language.<p>(original: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6172751"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6172751</a>)<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/calling-c-and-fortran-code/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/calling-c-and-for...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/metaprogramming/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/metaprogramming/</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/stdlib/base/#general-collections"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/stdlib/base/#general-col...</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/types/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/types/</a>\n[5] <a href=""http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/running-external-programs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/running-external-...</a>",1376503401

One book that I have found very instrumental in helping me cope with stress and anxiety is &quot;The Mind and the Brain&quot; by Jeffrey M. Schwartz and Sharon Begley. The reasons why are very specific I think:<p>1) Its vocabulary appeals to those who like me appreciate science.\n2) It tackles concepts that are common in zen and Buddhism but with solid, perhaps even more grounded, explanations. \n3) It helps the analytical minded to understand that there is a separation between what the brain experiences and the self.

First of all, a panic attack is not like ordinary anxiety.  Getting nervous ahead of a meeting is not a panic attack.  Sure sometimes people can get extremely nervous and have a panic attack at times like that, but people can also have a panic attack that seems to come out of the blue.  So there are different causes and variations on panic attacks that people here seem to not be comprehending.  There can be a number of completely physical rather than mental health issues that can cause panic attacks.  Especially if you start getting panic attacks without a history of anxiety you need to carefully rule out those physical causes before you assume that you just need to meditate more or get CBT or something.  And even if the cause is mental or psychological there are different types of panic attacks so CBT etc may not be effective and you or your friend may really need medication.  Anyway just because you have gotten really nervous a few times don&#x27;t assume that you understand someones condition well enough to give them medical advice especially if its to tell them to just meditate or somrthing.",1400895181

If you do everything right, you&#x27;ll be allowed to enter. A portion of the customs form will be teared off, stamped, and given to you to hold.<p>> (In my case, I was traveling with someone affiliated with the local football (soccer) team. He convinced the border guards that I&#x27;m an American player being tried out for the local team, which got us through the border with relative ease. It helped that I was wearing aforementioned Adidas track pants and have the physical build of a football player. It did not help that I was not told about this plan ahead of time, but thankfully they only questioned him and not me.)<p>> The clock is now ticking, because this stamp is only good for 24 hours. If you intend to stay overnight (>24 hrs), you need to find the &quot;Ministry of Interior&quot; and go through another round of questioning and paperwork (and again, possible bribe demands) before receiving a multi-day stamp.\nOh, and this &quot;Ministry of Interior&quot; is actually just a police booth somewhere deep inside in Tiraspol (the capitol), next to several abandoned factories, crumbling homes, and roaming chickens.

I feel pretty confident that had I applied at a &quot;top school&quot; I would have had a fair chance of getting in. Maybe not - I probably would have been weaker on the non-academic admission requirements. I ended up going to a local community college for free and then transferring to a state university where eventually I got my graduate degree. I received several awards while there for academic performance, had some papers published with my name on them, and had a 4.0 again.<p>Frankly it never even occurred to me to apply to other schools. I just wasn&#x27;t interested and nobody talked about it. If you asked me now why I didn&#x27;t, I couldn&#x27;t really tell you. Looking back, I&#x27;m sure some of it was moving away from home. In retrospect I would have been worse off financially - the scholarship didn&#x27;t hold past the CC, so I paid cash for the rest (I worked a _lot_) until I got a TA position and graduated debt free.<p>I think though some people in SV would still look at that in askance though, and see that as saying something - &quot;hey, this guy&#x27;s not as motivated&quot; or &quot;this guy wouldn&#x27;t be as dedicate as much of his life&quot; and maybe that&#x27;s true.

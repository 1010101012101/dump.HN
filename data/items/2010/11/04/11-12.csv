That article in Nature interviewed some people associated with the process who expressed not one jot of disbelief in the report. They wished the mistake hadn't happened, and had been caught sooner, and suggested ways to reduce mistakes in the future, but no-one thinks that mistake invalidates the report or the process.<p>I'll say it differently â€” if that's the biggest mistake you can find in the IPCC report (and given how much hand-wringing and complaining about it there has been, it's highly likely it <i>was</i> the biggest mistake), then you either have to accept climate change is real, or find a bigger mistake.<p>I really don't know why I'm arguing with you.

No, literally, it can't happen.  The level of professionalism with regards to source control, documentation, distribution, etc in most academic labs is insufficient to allow the code to be executed outside of the environment that it actually executes on.  If you put a tarball up somewhere, somebody who tries to run it is going to get a compile error because they're missing library foo or running on an architecture which doesn't match the byte lengths hardcoded into the assembly file, and then they're going to email you, and that is going to suck your time doing ""customer support"" when you should be doing what academics actually get paid to do: write grant proposals.<p>This, by the way, means that peer review by necessity consists of checking that you cited the right people, scratched the right backs, and wrote your paper in the style currently in fashion in your discipline, because reproducing calculations or data sets is virtually impossible.",1288871722

In the UK you are not required to work three months after giving notice unless it is a provision of your contract of employment. If you don't have a written contract - then you will be entitled to a statutory notice period that roughly  accrues in weekly units depending on years worked - but with cap. However,you can be paid in lieu of notice. It is fine to employ someone on one months notice - and less if they have worked for you for less than twelve months.\n2. Restrictive covenants are unenforceable in the UK if they are unreasonably wide. ie you may be restricted for a year from hopping into a company that does the same thing in the same area. But not from using you transferable skills in a different company or different area. \nIf someone tries to get you to sign to a two year, 200 mile radius, transferable skill / different business restriction - sign it and don't worry as it will not be enforceable.",1288871637

8034702,comment,8034301,8034301,9,0,eob,,,"One challenge with the PhD->CS Industry sidestep is that PhD candidates are extremely picky about the kind of jobs they&#x27;re willing to accept, and many companies are suspicious of the value/cost ratio of a fresh PhD.<p>If you&#x27;re a graduating PhD headed into academia, you will be the boss of your group, with almost nothing above you in the org chart telling you what to do. So it is natural for a PhD headed into industry to start from a place of expecting the same---from their perspective.<p>But from the perspective of industry, the PhD&#x27;s value isn&#x27;t judged the same way. They&#x27;ve just spent six years doing research, not shipping code. Their management experience is managing students and classrooms, not employees.<p>So this mismatch results in a perception of &quot;I&#x27;m being undervalued!&quot; from the perspective of the PhD and &quot;He&#x27;s overvaluing himself&quot; from the perspective of the company.<p>If the student and company don&#x27;t have high social IQ to navigate this situation, I can see how it would result in no offers being made.<p>Source: I&#x27;ve made hiring decisions about PhDs when I worked in industry, and now I&#x27;m a graduating PhD student going back into industry, so I can see it from both sides.",1405396793

At the end of the day, it is not a gigantic shared memory, as in Hogwild! paper conveniently describes. You need to synchronize slave&#x27;s model with master model, in model parallelism case, you need to send responses to another machine for further processes. This sounds extremely complicated actually to implement in modern HPC environment (assuming MPI as the main implementation technique).<p>Sorry if this sounds a bit defensive than it is meant to be. I just think that there are much more to the implementation than the simple Hogwild! approach (probably some clever pipelining to cover the communication / computation cost as the Hogwild! approach relaxed consistency of the model).<p>It seems that this year&#x27;s ImageNet classification competition result will be more interesting than what I expected.",1405396735

I haven&#x27;t scored an industry job yet, rather I&#x27;m working as a postdoc in SoCal. But anyway, I&#x27;ve been trying very hard to engage with industry by attending programming meetups and demonstrating my skills to people who could be involved in hiring. Most of what I&#x27;ve talked to people about has gone over well. Sure it is a different path to go from a PhD to industry than to go in from undergraduate, but you will have developed thinking skills during it that will be valuable to any company. As far as showing that you are up to snuff on &quot;best practices&quot;, a good set of github projects will go a long way if you have developed the right connections.<p>I have met a lot of PhDs in computational fields with mediocre coding skills, but if you are in the position of being up with the times it&#x27;s just a matter of marketing yourself properly. Not easy, but as I like to say, if you can code well your not in danger of starving anytime soon in this day and age.",1405396581

I have no college degree and am probably more marketable simply due to my wide experience in various industries and projects.

8034689,comment,8033210,8033811,1,0,kamaal,,,"Its not SQLite being slower, its a question of machine resources. When you use a Database cluster spanning across machines you are just throwing more resources at it, there no &#x27;magic&#x27; per se going on in other tools. There is also likely better indexing which enables efficient querying.<p>Since the whole database is in one file though 140TB may be the filesize limit, searching through a index of 140TB data will still be a lot slower. That is the case even with client-server models or even with Hadoop.<p>Most people claiming to have a big data problem, actually don&#x27;t have one. Its just bad understanding of SQL, coupled with NoSQL fashion which powers people to opt out of SQL. One more problem with SQL is, its a career path in itself. There is whole industry built around it, data base design, administration etc etc. And people who find this as high barrier to entry, take the easy way out and choose NoSQL based tools hoping it will act as a panacea- Only to re implement SQL badly at some point in their stack. But SQL has other advantages, it teaches you think about efficient representation of data. Which in turn leads to an overall better design of everything that connects it.<p>For most of your everyday so called &#x27;Big data&#x27; problems, SQLite will work like charm. This covers most of the shops that claim to be doing big data work.<p>For the real big data problems, well then SQLite wasn&#x27;t designed for it anyway.",1405396497
8034688,comment,8033916,8034600,6,0,ewzimm,,,"The problem of wealth distribution is certainly not solved, because the system you are describing, in which wealth is taken from someone, involves coersion. It requires violence to enforce. It requires consolidation of power. The system proposed here, however simple, is describing voluntary wealth redistribution. No one is forced into the system, but the rules of the system are set to level the playing field.<p>I think this is a good start, and we will likely see many more implementations of this basic idea. One genius aspect of software-based currency is that it allows the possibility of the establishment of laws without a police force. The currency is its own police force. Anyone who doesn&#x27;t like the rules can choose to use another cryptocurrency with different rules. This is consensus-based law, and it is a movement in the right direction.",1405396462

This is a basic economic principle as evidenced by the industrial revolution (machines took over most of those old jobs, and now there&#x27;s much less unemployment, poorhouses don&#x27;t exist, and the average person is much richer in <i>real</i> terms.)  To speak of some kind of saturation point where there is a machine for everything is pretty crazy.<p>Let&#x27;s step into lala-land and assume there&#x27;s one machine that can produce anything and perform any task.  It requires no maintenance and no inputs.  What&#x27;s the problem?  Everyone can have everything.  No money required.  Winning.<p>Stepping back to reality all these machines will require production, sales efforts, maintenance, electricity, network infrastructure, yadda yadda.  Goods-producing machines will need a supply chain and QA, and people to figure out what to make with it next.  And when exactly do we foresee machines taking over the service industry?  A machine that provides business consultancy?  Cuts your hair?  Caters to your animalistic needs?  This stuff is a long way off if it&#x27;s even possible.<p>Even when machines can do all this we&#x27;d need to remove every source of friction in the economy before we could even begin to dream of approaching that saturation point - in short that means global governance and regulation, no taxes, free trade, no behaviour limiting contracts, no currency risk, no language barrier.  All of these things create market distortions that create the potential for profit, and where the potential for profit exists, people will exploit it, and there will be jobs.<p>Long story short: we have many, many problems left to solve before we can all kick back and let the robot butler massage our feet.<p>Further, the idea that a basic income is best tackled with a crypto-currency is nonsense.  Crypto-currencies, like other currencies, derive their value from the underlying assets.  You can mine coins, but you can&#x27;t mine value.  In the UK we have a bottom-line tax rate of about 30% of GDP, and about 30% of that is social security.  We&#x27;re a generous country in this regard and have lots of people happily living their lives doing nothing.  It&#x27;s pretty close to this romantic notion of &#x27;basic income&#x27;.<p>If you haven&#x27;t done the maths on that yet, the UK&#x27;s percentage of GDP spent on social security is 30% x 30% = 9%.  Assuming SocialCoin is the only currency in the world and that global PPP is uniform (and in line with the UK today), we need to solve (as per the 10% of mining proceeds idea):<p>required_inflation * 0.1 = 0.09\nrequired_inflation = (0.09/0.1) = 0.9 = 90%<p>A world with 90% inflation is a world in crisis.  Assuming instead that we give <i>all</i> mining profits to the needy, we&#x27;d still need to maintain 9% inflation...which is also a world in crisis.<p>I haven&#x27;t, and won&#x27;t, even touch on the absurdity of the very notion of &#x27;basic income&#x27; (but there&#x27;s a reason it doesn&#x27;t enter economists heads).<p>All in this is just a thin and problematic veil over the desire to redistribute wealth from those who have it to those who don&#x27;t.  Theoretically this is already solidly solved - you take lumps of money from the rich (in any currency you fancy), you walk over to the poor, and you hand it to them.

Short answer, while UNIX had its &#x27;magic&#x27; number which looked at the first 32 bits (four bytes) of a file to figure out what kind it was (hash bang for the win) and Apple had its own awesomesauce of a &#x27;forked&#x27; file system where the file and what it was were in two completely separate but extensible parts of the file system, CP/M (which had emulated DEC) and then DOS which had emulated CP/M used a 3 character (which is only 24 bits but still plenty) to encode the type of file in the name since it couldn&#x27;t necessarily live in the file itself and there was no &#x27;attribute fork&#x27; to stick it in.<p>Interestingly this is a problem that lives on, people still want to identify <i>what</i> a file is and that requires some sort of identifier. Embedding it in the name is just as good as anything, but the important bit is that you stay consistent.

By doing just about everything custom, the overhead is minimal. Traffic is dirt cheap nowadays if you know where to look, so that&#x27;s not really a concern anymore either.",1405393450

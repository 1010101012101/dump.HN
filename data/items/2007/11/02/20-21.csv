In his whole large division, there seemed to be hardly anybody who actually got anything done. And, worse, there was no method for firing people who didn't do anything. ",1194035916

75573,comment,75249,75542,0,0,gojomo,,,"Good point. (And, as your signature indicates, this <i>is</i> more likely to be a static utility method.) <p>If I were defensively programming against unanswerable input, I'd tend towards failing fast with a single early check:<p><pre><code> static int roundUpToPowerOfTwo(int i) {\n  if(i>(1<<30)) throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Answer overflows int"");\n  int rounded = 1;\n  while(rounded<i) rounded <<= 1; \n  return rounded;\n }\n</code></pre>\nIf we needed to give answers for any size integer (or at least up to 2^(2^31-1)), we could use BigInteger, whose #bitLength method is useful:<p><pre><code>  static BigInteger roundUpToPowerOfTwo(BigInteger i) {\n   return BigInteger.ONE.shiftLeft(i.subtract(BigInteger.ONE).bitLength());\n  }\n</code></pre>\nAnd if we weren't being literal-minded about the original request, it might make sense to just return the exponent rather than the power-of-2 itself, and let the caller worry about overflows: <p><pre><code> static int ceilLog2(long val) {\n  return BigInteger.valueOf(val-1).bitLength();\n }\n</code></pre>\nOf course we are ignoring negative exponents, in the integer spirit of the original question.<p>There, is it done to death yet? :)\n",1194034459

If you like a product, you can click the Facebook icon and the product name, image, price and store will show up in your ""Posted Items"".  Yes, nothing spectacular, but we like it :)<p>-John",1194034194

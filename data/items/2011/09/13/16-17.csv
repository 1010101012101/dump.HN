But I usually charge around $100/hr.   I've gone as high as $200 and as low as $80 in recent times, but $100 is usually the target.  Of course, my prices float based on how much I want the work;  If prgmr.com just handed out a big credit and/or I'm drooling over some new hardware, you can often get a deal;  when the cashflow on my VPSs is good, on the other hand, not so much.   Last time I did full-time contracting through a body shop I got $72/hr, but this was several years back, and I've published a book since then.<p>I'm looking to have my company do more consulting as a way to raise short-term revenue, and as a way provide my employee(s) a way to do higher value work (and thus earn more money) without leaving my company for more profitable employers.<p>Ideally, I'd personally do about one day a week of contracting like this, and as employees become more experienced, slowly transition them from support to consulting.<p>As far as I can tell, rates depend as much on the client as on your skill level.   I've had some clients laugh at my rate and offer /more/ -  while others do the opposite.<p>I'm considering retainer type deals, and I'd be interested to hear how retainers have worked for other people.<p>edit: attempted a less-objectifying reword.",1315933038

We're so good at using physical tools because this simplicity allows us to learn their use on an unconscious level, ie. muscle memory.

The best developers are fascinated by the processes that animate their work; sometimes they can't dig down all the way given time constraints but I find that they (and I) could happily analyze (and ideally rewrite) the entire gordian knot of a complex system.<p>Entrepreneurs have a totally different profile. Instead of the ""how"" and ""what"" of the project, they focus on the ""why"" and the ""who cares"". Will this project be valuable? Should I pivot this idea? Who is my first customer and what do they want?<p>These tendencies don't coexists very well -- they both want to be priority 1 in my mind. While I've been writing code, polishing scripts, reading kernel code, and accumulating my 5000 lines of emacs-lisp hacks, my friends chose different routes and started small businesses or pursued influence and high salaries. Now I'm a super-wonky developer and they're much better at sniffing out the real value in the world. Each of us has our place and on some days I'd rather be them. Somehow though, and somewhat mysteriously, when it comes time to choose I'd rather be rewriting the low level than pursuing meaning at the high-level.",1315932271

2992184,comment,2989926,2990416,1,0,koffiezet,,,"I wonder if you ever even touched an iPhone or iOS device? You certainly never used one. I have a long history of using ""smartphones"", I owned a Nokia communicator, a Compaq windows mobile PDA, a Sony-Ericsson P910, and then decided nothing was really worth it.<p>So then came along the iPhone. It did exactly what I needed, I bought a 3G the moment it was available here in Europe. Then came Android. As a long-time embedded developer, suddenly, mobile applications became important. I now develop for both iOS and Android, and know both platforms pretty well. Android in my opinion is a geek's toy, and just like the Linux desktop ""good enough"", but not quite there yet. Simply put, iOS is way more polished. On some levels it does less, but what it does, it most likely does a lot better (viewed from a user pov). There are off course exceptions, Apple is not flawless - it's unbelievable that only now in the 5th major release their notifications-system is improved, and the lockscreen would finally be used to actually display usefull information. Another problem is the calendar app, which looks nice on the surface, but it's pretty useless for day-to-day use (luckily there is Week Cal). And don't even mention folders. I hate them, they're useless, and put apps in a dungeon to be forgotten forever. Anyway, these complaints are minor compared to my gripes with Android. I won't even start going down that path. Yes I tried the Nexus One and Nexus S we have here at the office extensively, I still take them with me when I have to travel for work-related work so I don't end up with massive personal phone bills.<p>And then came along tablets. I skipped the first generation iPad, I always wait for 2nd generation for most new stuff. Along came the ""competitor"" tablets. Ever played with a Xoom? No? Good advice: keep it that way. Playbook? Avoid like hell. Samsung galaxy tab? The 10"" is ok-ish. Not great, but usable - but spend my own money on it? No tx... Weird thing is, my biggest problem isn't necessarily Android (which isn't exactly ""nice"" on a tablet), but the 16:10 display, it's simply horrible for a tablet... Why do people think an aspect ratio for watching a movie (which is about ehm 5% of the things I do on my iPad2) should dictate the form factor? So as I said, I bought an iPad 2, and I'm very happy with it. From time to time, a test-sample of some unknown tablet is dropped on my desk to look at. The only-one I haven't seen is the Touchpad, which I would love to have.<p>Anyway, I am still daily confronted with Android phones, blackberries, windows mobile - I have to develop for it. I do know these platforms very well, it's my job. And I think Android is absolutely necessary to push competition, not only Apple, but also Windows Mobile 7, which is actually pretty impressive imho. Too bad WebOS probably doesn't have a future, this had a shared 2nd place with winmo7 on my mobile OS list. Android is 3rd, followed by Meego and then Blackberry OS, which I absolutely detest.<p>So please don't pretend other people never used anything else while you try to bash iOS and Apple... Nothing is black & white. Both Apple, Google, Microsoft, HP, Intel, Nokia, ... are companies trying to act in their own interest. Don't fool yourself, no mobile OS is perfect, but it's very hard to point out things iOS does worse than any competing OS.",1315931698

The world's largest Internet company, the world's largest on-line retailer, and the world's largest computer manufacturer are all comitted to a Java-based front-end platform.<p>2. GWT.<p>Java now serves the full stack for web apps. In the GWT world, writing an application in JavaScript instead of Java is like writing it in Assembler instead of C. In many ways, GWT is still in its infancy, but it is already capable of feats like the Quake 2 port that seem inconceivable in hand-written JavaScript.<p>3. Google<p>Google has been a driving force behind the advance of JavaScript over the past few years, but its flagship products have put Java firmly at the centre of its universe. The costly Oracle lawsuit might make them reconsider their course, but would they really after paying $12 billion for Motorola just to protect Android?<p>4. The cloud<p>Utility computing will drive an ever-increasing abundance of on-line services that will make desktop applications fade away. While never popular on the desktop, Java is well-established on the back-end and has solutions for most of the practical problems that come up in the cloud. It will be the logical choice for many new cloud-based projects.<p>5. Platform-independence<p>As we move towards an ever-increasing heterogeneity of platforms, using a language that is slightly different on each of them is not the way to go. JavaScript has an extremely limited standard library, and no standardized library format, or even a standardized inclusion format. Without plug-and-play libraries, you are doomed to use whatever your platform provides.<p>6. JavaScript is unsuitable for multi-core.<p>Multi-core is now the standard, even on mobile devices, yet JavaScript remains inately single-threaded. A parallelized event system could be hacked on top of it, but that brings us back to 5. Java is arguably not well-suited for parallelism, but capable at least. You can ignore multi-core for a while, but only until someone really starts to make you look bad.<p>7. Abundance of Java tools, libraries, software, books, schools, programmers<p>This should perhaps be #1, but Java is simply what much of the world knows and uses and you get major leverage from that.<p>I do think there is a niche for JavaScript becoming a popular scripting language, in favour of Perl, PHP and Bash, which have become outdated due to their focus on local I/O, rather than web I/O. I also think scripting languages are about to become a whole lot more important with the advance of utility computing. Definitely, JavaScript will explode, but the decade will still belong to Java.",1315931126

The cost to build is a fixed cost and the selling price is marginal.<p>2. Neither is it about building ""how much value does it add"" \ndirectly into the price. An example: light bulbs provide more value than the price at which they sell.<p>3. What it is about, is asking how many units could I move directly if I sold it at this price versus this price versus this price. And then asking how many units could I move indirectly as a second-order consequence of having moved so many units at such and such a price. Another small example: Thomas Edison sold his light bulbs at a loss for several years in order to sell more units, scale production efficiency and ultimately recoup those years of losses in a single year of tremendous volume.<p>4. This hints at something people like Thomas Edison, Henry Ford and Sam Walton all discovered: it's better to charge less if you can sell more because there are more than first-order consequences involved. The idea applies to light bulbs, cars, retail. It sparked revolution in those industries and it will spark revolution in other industries which apply it. All industries are commodities, some industries have yet to recognize it.<p>Practically, price should be constantly decreasing.",1315930733

As for how they did it, it really depends on the infrastructure in place already. If you are using any cms (wordpress, drupal) it was likely through that, as there are a number of weaknesses published regularly that are used against it. The first thing to do is check current index to see who wrote to it last, and at what time. If it is the webuser (ie apache, nginx, etc) then it was almost certainly a hack from a browser, if it was root, the server has been compromised. Once you have the file's update time, you should look over your access logs to see if there is anything suspicious lines up that time. As for the cleanup, assuming you are using a linux based server and it was compromised, install rkhunter, run it right away. This should catch anything that they would have used (it seems like a scriptkiddy), change any access port, update your ssh password and change the port, and preferably change over to a key based login system (<a href=""http://pkeck.myweb.uga.edu/ssh/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pkeck.myweb.uga.edu/ssh/</a>).

It's like evolution. We may not <i>need</i> 500 different web servers but .. that's a lot of different ideas, a lot of variation, and in the long run, a lot of innovation. Eventually the ""best"" way is chosen and we go to the next generation.<p>I actually think the proliferation of programming languages and frameworks, especially open source, is one of the purest meritocracies you can find. They live or die by their quality, innovation, new features. And the whole community is dragged forward. What you are advocating is basically central planning. Did you realise that?<p>> I can still deliver the same output as node.js with classic ASP/Jscript from 1998 arguably with less code and time spent.<p>LOL. Dude. No way.<p>Something you said earlier was instructive as to the mistake you are making with this line of thought. You said that ""programmers can't do anything more today than they could in 2001"" - or something similar. Or that other guy said it and you agreed, whatever.<p>Look, that's literally true. In fact it's literally true to say that any programmer can do anything as long as they use a turing complete language. This has been true since the days of ENIAC.<p>What has advanced, massively, is the knowledge of the <i>best ways of doing things</i>. Design. Efficiency. Elegance, maintainability, scalability. <i>That</i> is what has mainly improved. Knowledge. The laws of the universe have not changed, everyone agrees with that, but we have worked out, a little more, what works and what doesn't.<p>And I'm afraid your ASP/Jscript falls into the latter category. I'm sure you could mimic some tiny subset of node.js using that toolset. But it would be a hideous mess of spaghetti code. Unless, of course, you used the knowledge you gained over the last 10 years to basically reimplement node.js in ASP, presumably gaining express pre-approved VIP entry to Hell in the process.

It's not glamorous. No one says ""whooooo I want to develop a data API and license it!"" Everyone is too busy developing a Facebook for cats or whatever.<p>2. It's really, really useful. If you work with data in any capacity, you know that an API for said data is much better than scraping data from HTML. Even the HTML-parsing modules in Python/Ruby/Perl, which are friendly relative to raw HTML + regexes, are brutal.<p>3. It's super-interesting. The world has <i>so much unstructured data</i>, and yet this market is (almost) untapped! There is data on almost anything you can think of -- health care records, pedestrian/vehicular/retail traffic, food consumption -- and you'd only need some thought, maybe a few data-collecting tools, and an API to make it useful.",1315929639

The feedback between both sides is important for improvement.  The success of the make-it-work side helps to quantify the value of the ideas coming from the understand-your-tools side.

8948435,comment,8947606,8947606,0,0,joesmo,,,"In addition to the negative impacts on code and the actual product of going too fast, there is the additional problem of working at an unsustainable pace. That then becomes the norm and is expected even when it can no longer be kept up. This isn&#x27;t a problem specific to programming. It shows up in almost any job.<p>Over-performance will never be rewarded. One might get a slightly higher bonus if one is lucky, but generally it&#x27;ll be forgotten. All those long days, nights, and weekends spent working non-stop will be immediately erased from the company&#x27;s recollection once the product ships. They will be especially forgotten once the developer can no longer sustain that pace which now has become the norm and needs to be reprimanded (despite still being objectively productive).<p>In the end, it&#x27;s only the developer who suffers, and it&#x27;ll be great suffering up to and including mental and physical disability from not slowing down. Excellent advice.",1422295128

How the universe works.<p>My impression is that a lot of science that is applied to intelligent machines is based on a deterministic physical model based on Newton and LaPlace.

I don&#x27;t have any insider info, but I seem to recall reading a post a long time ago where they explained having some kind of x-of-y system of paper wallets stored in bank safety deposit boxes all over the country with a lot of redundancy.<p>If you are willing to assume they have even a minimal level of common sense and competency, they have an offline storage system that is very robust.<p>> But beyond tech problems, consider a thought experiment: If you&#x27;re a gambling person, would you trade 20 years of your life in exchange for becoming a billionaire?<p>I think this is an interesting thought experiment.

(what I refer to as rat-holing and has been done here [1]). Note that even if a participant doesn&#x27;t rat-hole/shred their orders doesn&#x27;t preclude them from spoofing, it just makes it less profitable to do so, and easier for advanced counterparty&#x27;s to track and recognize bad reputation of a spoofer.<p>Not making it explicit allows spoofers to trivially run their algorithms without having to rat-hole/shred so it lowers the barrier to entry for spoofers and blends their orders in among the non-spoof orders resting in the book making their strategies more effective.<p>In any case spoofing is a felony because of dodd-frank. [2]<p>The only question that remains is does this exchange fall under the scope of dodd-frank&#x27;s provisions against disruptive practices? What will they do to ensure that spoofing doesn&#x27;t take place on their exchange? The law doesn&#x27;t contemplate an exchanges ability to opt-out of this provision. If they are running an exchange that allows people to spoof they could be seen as allowing those felonies to occur through indifference because it generates volume and hence makes them more money, making them an accessory to the crime. In any case someone will need to enforce the provision on their exchange otherwise a perverse moral hazard is created where some participants are willing to risk breaking the law because the worst they will expect is a slap on the wrist, while those that do follow the law are at a severe informational disadvantage.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.fbi.gov/chicago/press-releases/2014/high-frequency-trader-indicted-for-manipulating-commodities-futures-markets-in-first-federal-prosecution-for-spoofing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fbi.gov/chicago/press-releases/2014/high-frequenc...</a><p>2: <a href=""http://www.cftc.gov/ucm/groups/public/@newsroom/documents/file/disruptive_factsheet.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cftc.gov/ucm/groups/public/@newsroom/documents/fi...</a>",1422294701

A lot of people would probably hate it, and even more obvious, most people would just forget.<p>I thought the idea of teaching kids to code is to show them that it can be immensely rewarding and fun, thus encouraging those that &quot;click&quot; with it to explore it further on their own.<p>As a guy who gets bored often, I consider myself to be extremely lucky to have discovered a &quot;passion&quot; for computer-y things early on.

That&#x27;s partly because I came to programming as a math/industrial engineering student, where I was really writing code to solve problems and get answers rather than a sustainable, usable product.  Even once I started writing code for users, it was generally pretty experimental and research-y, so I usually got a green field project.<p>In the past few years, I&#x27;ve worked repeatedly with existing code bases to extend or modify functionality (or just fix problems), and it has been an amazing learning experience.  Not all of the code has been good, much of it has been questionable.  But the process of understanding someone else&#x27;s code, figuring out how to change it, balancing the harm of forking vs the benefit of improving, dealing with pull requests and merges… there are a number of skills you will only learn from years in this kind of environment.<p>One huge challenge here is when you don&#x27;t work in an organization that understands software.  People aren&#x27;t knowledgeable about software are often impressed with green field programmers &quot;jim wrote the <i>whole thing</i>&quot;.  Truth is, understanding a different code base and getting to the point where you can improve it and contribute back to it is (at least in my experience) <i>far</i> more challenging than just writing something from scratch.  It seems that most people who write software are already well aware of this, but it can be a hard sell outside (in fact, you may even find that people seriously question your progress - a green field app there&#x27;s something nifty and new to demo even day, with existing code bases, there&#x27;s a lot of confusion and investigation - and it can be very dispiriting to spend days stubbornly trying to understand and diagnose a feature, finally solve it, and realize that the team is disappointed with your progress).<p>However, the good software teams appear to be well aware of the challenges, and it&#x27;s an essential learning experience.",1422294523

Also, most commercial egg processors wash eggs, mostly to make them look cleaner but also, in theory, to remove salmonella. So, between the washing and the dry refrigerator environment, that cuticle is mostly gone by the time it gets to the supermarket. When you take a cold egg and leave it out at room temperature, it begins to sweat, which facilitates the growth of bacteria that could contaminate the egg.<p>In summary, yes, fresh from the farm eggs, can be left out at room temperature.

It included this line: “I see your site is not monetized at present, and I think there is room to do so in a non-intrusive manner that can still make you money.”<p>> I don’t know what I love most about that. I think it’s that from the eyes of someone who sees Taboola ads as “non-intrusive”, what I’m doing at Daring Fireball doesn’t look like “monetization” at all.

From the source (on Quora, here: <a href=""http://www.quora.com/What-do-software-developers-age-30-and-over-know-now-that-they-wish-they-had-known-in-their-20s/answer/Michael-O-Church"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/What-do-software-developers-age-30-and-...</a>):<p><i>3. Recognize underperformance and overperformance and avoid them. There are a lot of low-effort players who stay employed for years. This isn&#x27;t a bad strategy if you&#x27;re settled, but I wouldn&#x27;t fall too low. That said, the only people who typically get fired for underperformance are the people who fail so badly that they generate work for others. People who hide and do little tend not to make any enemies. At the same time, be cautious of overperformance. This isn&#x27;t like college where challenging your professor&#x27;s ideas could earn you an &#x27;A&#x27; if you argued your point well. Overperformers often also generate extra work for their superiors and colleagues and draw unwanted attention (see: McNulty in The Wire) and are more likely to be culled for &quot;performance&quot; (98 percent of &quot;performance management&quot; in companies is politics) than underperformers. I&#x27;m not saying that you shouldn&#x27;t work hard and do a good job and learn as much as you can. That&#x27;s not necessarily overperformance. In my experience, though, overperformance is much more dangerous than underperformance. It can get you just as fired and it will happen a lot faster. If you end up stuck between the two, prefer underperformance.</i><p>I&#x27;m not saying that people shouldn&#x27;t work hard or do a good job. On the contrary, I think young people should bust their asses at growing the skills and contacts that will serve them well for the rest of their lives. I&#x27;m saying &quot;avoid overperformance&quot;, and <i>overperformance</i> isn&#x27;t the same thing as &quot;doing a great job&quot;. I&#x27;m saying, &quot;don&#x27;t become like McNulty on <i>The Wire</i>&quot; (or a certain person at Google who tried to prevent a product failure and got burned for it). McNulty is a textbook overperformer: he loves the job, it doesn&#x27;t love him back, and he puts so much into it that it destroys his life and career.<p>Sorry, but I&#x27;m pretty fucking pissed out this being out there like that.

But a game that&#x27;s not completely pegging the CPU will have some idle time that can be used for small collections, so limiting the amount of garbage produced on each frame should put an upper bound on the amount of work done during each frame.<p>When I was helping Rovio port Angry Birds to the web a few years ago, we ran into serious frame hitches that were being triggered by GC pauses in Chrome. Two things fixed this -- the first was fixing a bug that caused it to run a full mark/sweep far too aggressively; but the second was when V8 committed an incremental collector (not concurrent, just able to spread the work out more by being able to run a partial mark/sweep and resume it later). After that, the GC pauses disappeared into tiny ~N00µs pauses that never impacted the game.",1422293406

They set themselves up as wizards who are the only ones able to make the computers do their magic and make the task seem much more difficult than it is.  After all, if journalists, lobbyists, customer representatives, and such were able to write their own SQL queries, then Bob the SQL Guru™ would be out of a job.  Plus, you would have to give these unwashed masses access to the systems.<p>I&#x27;m being a little harsh to IT departments in my caricature, but my experience has been that 90% of them make the other 10% look bad.  IT at my wife&#x27;s company is particularly bad; if she wants data out of their database she has to request a database report from a group in Kuala Lumpur (she is in Dallas).  She has to basically write the SQL query in plain English in the request in order to get exactly what she wants, because from what I can tell this group is basically an English->SQL translator.  If the data is not what she wanted she has to do it all over again.  Thus it takes her days to get what she could get in minutes if she had her own MySQL client.  On other things I have offered to show her how to use Python to automate things, but those conversations always end with &quot;IT won&#x27;t let us install anything&quot;.  In that kind of environment I&#x27;m not surprised that people who have a natural reluctance to programming would have said reluctance amplified.",1422292802

Someone parsing CSV doesn&#x27;t mean they can now write a distributed file system, for instance.<p>The fact of the matter is that we simply do not <i>have</i> the tooling to make programming as easy as 1-2-3. Comparing it to writing isn&#x27;t even adequate. The analogy would only make sense if the average person needed to know dozens of grammars (protocols) to express themselves in language, among other constraints. They don&#x27;t. There&#x27;s a world of difference between practical computing and some sugary ideal of everyone coding like it&#x27;s their second nature.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with people picking up programming if they need it.

I do agree teaching basic skills with tools like spreadsheet programs, etc, are fantastic. But at some point in time, it will become a roadblock to <i>not</i> know how to write a basic script to automate some repetitive/remedial task.<p>That&#x27;s not to say everyone should learn how to write massive enterprise software, or have deep understanding of how a kernel works. Rather, it&#x27;s to say people need to learn how to make the computer work for them in the way that suits them best, not just how some Vendor thinks they should work. Being able to write some quick script simply requires problem solving skills.<p>There is a significant advantage to the journalist who can write their own SQL and query data out of a massive database by themselves without having to depend on someone else. There&#x27;s a massive advantage to the lobbyist who can better understand statistical trends visually because they learned how to represent, consume and model the data with R.<p>There are fields where non-programmers are the only ones who fundamentally understand their domain well enough to write software for it. Take the various sciences. How can a non-chemist accurately write a chemical modelling and simulation software without first having to learn how things work? Not very well... even if they designed the software based on some spec, it&#x27;s unlikely all of the professional chemists domain knowledge from 30+ years of in-field research will accurately translate into a hired-gun&#x27;s handy-work.<p>The main issue I see in practice is people are either afraid to begin, or get some glossy-eyed look when the word &quot;programming&quot; is brought up.

When Alice wants to send $20 to Bob in exchange for a product, Alice first picks a mutually trusted arbitrator, whom we’ll call Martin, and sends the $20 to a multisig between Alice, Martin and Bob. Bob sees that the payment was made, and confirms the order and ships the product. When Alice receives the product, Alice finalizes the transaction by creating a transaction sending the $20 from the multisig to Bob, signing it, and passing it to Bob. Bob then signs the transcation, and publishes it with the required two signatures.</i><p>In this case, Bob is Coinbase and Alice is you.  Alice plus Martin always retain control over the coins, so Bob alone can&#x27;t take them offline.<p><i>The way that a multisignature wallet works is simple. Instead of the Bitcoin address having one private key, it has three. One private key is stored semi-securely, just as in a traditional Bitcoin wallet. The second key the user is instructed to store safely (eg. in a safety deposit box), and the third key is stored on the server.</i><p>Basically, the user would be the one storing it in offline storage, not Coinbase.

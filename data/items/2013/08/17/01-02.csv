6227897,comment,6227517,6227693,1,0,crazygringo,,,"As far as I can tell from reading the readme, it does <i>NOT</i> support throwing exceptions from within callbacks.<p>Because, of course, there&#x27;s no way to technically do that in anything that is JavaScript at its core -- at least as far as I&#x27;m aware of. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong?<p>It says &quot;This includes error handling via callbacks.&quot; -- not error handling via exceptions. Elsewhere it says &quot;Any errors reported by fs.readFile (returned via callback) will be thrown automatically.&quot;, so maybe it converts certain callback error functions to exceptions? But in any case, that&#x27;s not the same as throwing an exception inside of a callback, and having it &quot;bubble up&quot;. Unless I&#x27;m misunderstanding (which would be great!).",1376704591

Then you can use your newly compiled version of kal to recompile itself. This is how I create the npm releases.<p>It&#x27;s not turtles all the way down, though.

6227890,comment,6225951,6227023,10,0,rdtsc,,,"> He said that everyone in Russia just laughed it off, and they knew that nothing would ever happen.<p>That is in large true. There was no constantl stream of news on dangers of evil empires and scare us with total annihilation. At least in the 80s it wasn&#x27;t happening as far as I remember. &quot;American imperialists&quot; was still used in propaganda and news but it wasn&#x27;t serious. Or rather few took propaganda seriously. Heck by 80&#x27;s the hottest thing in Soviet Union were American jeans, music, products, movies. All that was underground, the forbidden fruit if you wish.<p>Now what you should be worried about it that you have been brainwashed. There was no equivalent real life credible threat to the extent it was dramatized and inflated in American propaganda. You should be worried perhaps that in a country with supposedly a free press and open criticism people were mislead in a much large and degree than in a totalitarian communism country. CIA and other intelligence agencies chronically overestimated and inflated figures and threat models in order to get more funding. That should worry you. That is happening today as well when it comes to war on terror.<p>Another point is a joke I like to tell people and (I&#x27;ve mentioned this before, so I apologize to those) -- when the Soviet Union fell we found out &quot;everything they told us about Communism was a lie and everything they told us about the American style Capitalism was true&quot;.

6227869,comment,6226545,6227651,4,0,jholman,,,"You&#x27;re mistaken on both counts, even though your top-level point is essentially correct.<p>On the first count, you&#x27;re mistaken because there&#x27;s no reason to assume that the distribution is symmetric.  This doesn&#x27;t damage your <i>point</i>, but as klodoph says, your actual example numbers are not necessarily representative.  You&#x27;ll note that this minor mistake in your comment has attracted a legion of minor corrections, all of them correct, all of them missing (or at least ignoring) your most-important point.<p>On the second count, that&#x27;s like saying that math is the foundation of computing, and so the two are indistinguishable.  klodolph is correct that the two are different, and it doesn&#x27;t affect your point at all, so you should acknowledge the minor correction and stick to the relevant point.<p>More generally, did you notice that your top-level comment was basically saying &quot;Warren Buffet is wrong about this aspect of investing&quot;?  You could be right, but it&#x27;s not likely.  I believe the reason for this mistake is that you may have have misread this sample of Buffet&#x27;s thinking (and your overall claims as I understand them may actually agree with and Buffet as I understand him).<p>(In my humble understanding) Buffet claims that there may or may not exist investors who have superior (or inferior) skill, but that in MOST cases the results are due to luck, and &quot;skilled&quot; investors are mostly indistinguishable from lucky investors.  Although I have not seen you agree or disagree with this claim, I note that all of your arguments are consistent with this.  Your arguments revolve around being unable to determine which are which, after the fact; so do Buffet&#x27;s!  I further note that it seems ludicrous to claim that there do not exist anti-skilled investors, and thus all other investors will be more skilled than the mean skill level, and that this probably <i>won&#x27;t matter</i>, because luck will drown it all out.<p>My overall points here are:<p><pre><code>    * I agree with your high-level claims (as I understand them) about money-managers\n    * I believe Warren Buffet, in this letter to Katherine Graham, agrees with\n           your high-level claims\n    * nearly every commenter in these threads agrees with your high-level claims\n        * the comment by wheaties is a counter-example\n    * some of the minor details of your points are technically wrong or confusing, \n           in ways that invite nit-picking, but do not impact your actual argument\n\n</code></pre>\nOn the other hand, starting on page 15 (of 19), Buffet suggests (and advocates) an alternative (his #5) that is NOT fully respectful of the efficient market hypothesis.  So your position is not Buffet&#x27;s entire position (though I see from your Equities Myths page that you have noticed this, and you suggest that perhaps Buffet is nothing except lucky).",1376703846
6227868,comment,6225104,6225104,1,0,jzwinck,,,"$30/month is too much for this to get Wal-Mart traction (which is what it needs, because not even the daughters of seniors buy FitBits online).  Seniors often live on what they call &quot;fixed income&quot; which is a euphemism for government aid, pensions (which are diminishing), etc.  A new expense cannot be covered by working harder or smarter.  A $30/month new expense is exactly why lots of seniors do not have smartphones (ironic then that Amulyte folks say they considered making a phone app but not enough of the audience have smartphones, then made a device that costs the same as a smartphone data plan).<p>Consider that the Kindle 3G comes with free cellular service.  The hardware is in the same price ballpark, so why does Kindle let me download entire books for free, but Amulyte charges me $30/month to publish tiny updates that I hope I don&#x27;t need?<p>Also consider the SPOT satellite messenger.  It costs $150 plus $150 per year, which is much cheaper than Amulyte.  The main downside for this application is that it does not work indoors--but the SPOT folks could add GSM capability and then their device seems almost universally better (the one exception being ergonomics for seniors).<p>Finally, ergonomics.  Amulyte can&#x27;t be too large, or it will be a constant dangling reminder of dying.  And it obviously shouldn&#x27;t be black in color--if not because black implies death then because new little black electronic widgets are really confusing and scary to old people.

The only one that had a native date picker component (on my setup) was Chrome. The polyfill version didn&#x27;t seem fully operational (just an overflow list of the same date?).<p>The Chrome native suffers from the same UX snafu that so many Date Pickers do - it&#x27;s fine for relative dates, but terrible for absolute ones. If you want to schedule an event in a week it&#x27;s great. Or of you want to search for flights.<p>However, if you want to enter a Date of Birth, it&#x27;s terrible. You have to scroll through hundreds of months to get to the year you want.<p>So maybe you fall back to typing? In the native picker in Chrome, you can muddle through the day/month piece, but you can&#x27;t type a straight year. e.g. start by typing &quot;19&quot; for &quot;1975&quot; and it&#x27;ll match &quot;1909&quot;. This also makes it impossible to enter a date in the 2000&#x27;s!<p>You do get a &quot;spinner&quot; that might let you set the year, but the buttons are so small I think it defies practical usability.<p>Bah! Interestingly the iOS version does not suffer from this gripe as has a slot-machine three drum date selector. It does default to today, but it&#x27;s pretty easy to move +/-50 years in either direction.<p>Sorry, that was a genuine rant. I know this is not intrinsic to Brick, but for me a universal Date Picker is #1 bugbear that I&#x27;d like it to solve.<p>(* The Chrome one also defaulted to the wrong timezone.

With almost no background checks happening, since the Dutch immigration office can&#x27;t handle the influx.<p>What European countries need to do is consult and take some cues from Israel, since they&#x27;ve been dealing with muslim terrorism for a long while. And every time I visited Israel I felt save. At the same time I don&#x27;t think Israel is a police state.<p>I remember, back when I was young, almost every couple of months, maybe even every month, there was some bomb exploding in Israel, killing people at marketplaces and in buses. Once Israel build the wall and increased border checks, these events happen way less often. The wall did work well to protect the citizens, no matter what some leftist people might want to say. Likewise, I do believe walls will make Europe saver.<p>Of course now Israel deals with stabbers, but I&#x27;m sure they figure out a solution. At the very least, they have armed citizens all over the country, ready to take countermeasures once these things happen. Here in The Netherlands we&#x27;re mostly sitting ducks.",1449398885

Why should programmers be an exception?</i><p>One way of looking at programmers is that they are managers of an extremely cheap, fast, scalable, yet stupid, workforce.  Once that workforce is put into action it can operate indefinitely.  The problem is this workforce is very rigid in what it can do, and it must be told <i>exactly</i> what to do.  It also requires a certain amount of maintenance due to security issues and ecosystem rot, but even so, the fundamental nature of this workforce has completely changed the landscape of the global economy by discovery of a new type of worker neither human nor animal.<p>Looking at it in this light, programmers potentially deserve to be paid on the order of top managers and even entrepreneurs and growth-phase directors.  But not all of them, because being a programmer entails getting lost deep in the weeds of the <i>mechanics</i> of managing this invisible workforce.  So the people who are capable of doing this are not necessarily the type of people who are good at understanding and articulating the business goals.  Furthermore, because of the inscrutability of the work to non-programmers it is very difficult to enforce accountability from the outside, and therefore it is all too easy for programmers to become infatuated with operations that actually yield no value to the greater business.<p>At the end of the day programmers can drive businesses just as management can, but the tools are different.  This is why I believe calling programmers &quot;engineers&quot; is a misnomer—it&#x27;s not because real engineering is harder, but because programming is much more open-ended; a running program is literally logic incarnate.  There is no limit to what can be done with software, but whether that can be harnessed to create a profitable enterprise is another question.",1449398856

I ask the question because I&#x27;ve known <i>many</i> people who object in the <i>strongest</i> terms that <i>everything</i> that OSHA does is unreasonable and an obvious overreach.

All photos from all clouds are in the category of photos, music in music category, etc.\nYou say that this is cloudGOO, but cloudGOO gives only 3  clouds in the free version, and we give 7. cloudGoo allows you to get up to 42 GB, and we allow you to get minimum 100 GB. We allow you to create additional categories, our app is translated into 25 languages, allows you to find and remove any duplicates, we give detail statistics about everything concerning clouds and files in them and provide easy search of all the files in the clouds, auto uploading all types of files and work without an Internet connection. We allow you to manage settings of all  categories, and all the clouds, to decide which category to link with clouds, and much more. \nWe made really easy to use and beautiful app that collects all in one place and gives 100 GB of cloud space for free :).\nThis is mobile solution, so please do not compare us with otixo, which deals only with file transfer, with Jolicloud, which does not collect everything in one place, and you still have to switch  between clouds, as in odrive.\nAlthough, half a year more and our decision will be released on PC and MAC, and believe me, there we will offer features that will surprise everyone :)\nWe do not have a sponsor, and there is no money involved. We all pull ourselves so could yet develop only android solution. You know that there are more than 5,000 kinds of Android devices and we can not physically test our app on all of them, we ask all concerned and curious to take part in beta testing. \nPlease, send your gmail to bcloud@bnesis.com, so that we could send you an invitation next week for beta testing.",1449398430

10684898,comment,10684730,10684730,0,0,CM30,,,"Personally (as someone from Europe), I&#x27;d say the general reasons we don&#x27;t have an equivalent tp Google or Silicon Valley or any of that sort of thing are more that:<p>1. European laws are too restrictive.  It&#x27;s especially notable with stuff like the hilariously stupid online tax laws the area has (having to apply different tax rates based on the location of the user rather than the business makes it hugely more complex than it has to be) or the right to be forgotten, but it just feels we&#x27;re too restrictive here in general.<p>2. Culture.  People in the US seem more ambitious and more willing to risk everyone for the small chance of becoming a millionaire/billionaire at the end of it.  People in European countries on the other hand seem to be encouraged to avoid risk and avoid anything that might lead to less job security in the short term.  Probably because failure in the US is seen as a minor bump in the road, whereas failure in Europe is seen as the worst possible thing imaginable.<p>3. Money.  Not just in the form of venture capital (though that&#x27;s a huge reason), but also because US startups tend to pay their employees more, whereas their European equivalents stick to the average local wages.  Hence the best programmers, designers and other such people usually either find employment in a more stable company (read, one where there&#x27;s a work/life balance) or move to the US to work in Silicon Valley.<p>If we want a &#x27;European Google&#x27; or European startups in general, we need to become less risk averse, more willing to reward the types of people needed to work in those companies and less obsessed about regulations.<p>Oh, and fix the issues certain areas have with internet connection speeds.  The fact that a lot of areas in large cities like London can&#x27;t get fibre internet and the likes is not helping our tech businesses compete with their US counterparts.",1449398375
10684897,comment,10681555,10684567,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Agreed that the presentation does not help but it <i>is</i> an interesting train of thought and by far the most interesting part of this particular thread on HN. Indeed the <i>output</i> has value, the skill by itself is of no value. Just like painting has value and writing have value. There are lots of terrible paintings, terrible programs and terrible books. Those have no value, and then there are some really good paintings, great programs, great books. Those do have value. And the skill that allowed the bad stuff to be created is the same skill that allowed the good stuff to be created. So the skill per-se is not the differentiating factor, the quality of the application of that skill is what allows one to create valuable work and being the intermediary between someones ideas and valuable work is why programmers, writers and painters can make a living.<p>It&#x27;s the whole basis of IP law and all the associated bits-and-pieces that allow all of us to make a living. Intellectual property has a shadow side, but this side is the one that keeps the IT world afloat.<p>The same laws that govern file sharing allow writers, programmers and other people skilled in some art to create enough value that they can make a living, sometimes even a very comfortable one and those writers and programmers that manage to hold on to the fruits of their labor long enough can do very well for themselves indeed.<p>> What would happen if you exercised clarity? Bad things?<p>Unlikely, but not everybody is equally capable of expressing their thoughts clearly.

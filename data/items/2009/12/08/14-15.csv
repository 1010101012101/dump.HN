983738,comment,982803,983393,0,0,tom_b,,,"The missing discussion point for me is more fundamental - how and when should I break with my RDBMS data modeling habits?<p>I can't say for sure, but suspect some of the headlong rush into denormalized NoSQL stores is motivated by the ease of the data model.  I wonder if once you go down that road, if your ""program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of"" what you get in a decent RDBMS. (Forgive my hijacking of Greenspun)<p>That said, I'm usually working in denormalized models anyway (star schemas in data warehouses for handy-dandy slice/dice/drill), so I'm completely open to different ways of approaching data processing and analysis problems.<p>I actually feel more free with SQL than limited though.  What I would really enjoy would be to have the fully expressive power of SQL embedded in a natural feeling way in a higher level language.  I'm interested in Q (of KDB) for this reason, have also been baking my brain in prolog to tear down old data model habits, and hacking some in Ruby and Common Lisp for the same reasons.<p>Of course, I'm probably breaking my career in the process, since I've made a habit of getting paid to work on RDBMS walking the line between hardware/software performance tuning.  But because of that, I'm also glad to see new approaches to RDBMS storage and innovation in the whole DB space.",1260283927

When he says, ""The paintings made between 1430 and 1500 are still unsurpassed"" then my impression is that he's just stating his opinion.  But because he doesn't bother to preface it with, ""Well this is just my opinion, but..."" then it sounds like everything that he says is, as you say, ""generalizations based on [his] own tastes, but presented as deep insights about the world"".<p>So because all of his statements aren't prefaced with ""sometimes it seems to me"" or ""I wonder if"" or ""Maybe it's the case that"", then it comes across like he's speaking as if everything he says is absolute truth, whereas a lot of it is simply his musings about the world.<p>I totally understand why this rubs a lot of people the wrong way.

983700,comment,983594,983594,0,0,grellas,,,"The horror stories are real but the environment has changed to the relative advantage of founders/entrepreneurs.<p>In the 1980s, founders who approached VCs were more like supplicants who had comparatively little knowledge or sophistication about how to deal with an elite group on whom they utterly depended and whose power in relation to theirs was lopsidedly overwhelming. Due-diligence cycles, for example, could easily extend a year or more as the founders hoped for the best that their much-needed capital would come to them one way or the other.<p>Today, founders have far more knowledge and sophistication in dealing with VCs and, even more important, a typically broader range of choices. It is much easier today to come up with winning business models that either bypass or defer VC funding in ways that give founders potentially more leverage than they once had. When dealing with VCs today, founders also have a much greater understanding of potential pitfalls and abuses (such as those highlighted in this piece).<p>It is the same dance as 25 years ago but the average founder no longer is led (more or less) blindly as before. The dynamic has tipped more in the founders' direction, and this change is here to stay. Think of it as a <i>relative</i> empowerment of founders in relation to those of the past.",1260282108

It's not as if Google gives everything of theirs away, but it's usually pretty evident where they're coming from and their decisions generally make sense to outsiders.  Nokia just seems a bit ambivalent about the whole thing, and while they're definitely involved with open source, I don't get as much of a sense of them 'getting it'.<p>Also, 'getting it' doesn't just mean releasing a bunch of code under a nice license, it means having a sensible strategy that advances the goals of the company.

There's more room on there than those pay sites.  It's nicely integrated with ubuntu services (like ppa compile farm etc).  Also I can make bazaar projects of my other projects on google code, github, etc.<p>Plus the launchpad source code has been released.  I feel safer not relying on a closed source tool if I don't have to.  Also, there is a better chance I can make modifications to it if I want.<p>I'm only one week into my latest love affair with bzr/launchpad... and so far so good.  I hope it doesn't break my heart again.<p>Google code has svn or hg support, but limits you to a small amount of projects.

12371,comment,12335,12335,0,0,ramen,,,"I often find myself defending PHP. It seems to be very unpopular lately, at least by some very vocal individuals on the web. I like PHP, and here's why:<p>It runs everywhere, has lots of libraries, and most of my friends know it.<p>That, for me, is huge. It's enough for me to forgive, tolerate, and even enjoy programming in the language.<p>Anyway, here's what I don't like:<p>The lack of a decent module system.<p>The lack of closures.<p>The weird reference semantics of objects in PHP4. PHP5 is way better in this regard, but now I have to worry about whether my code will still run on PHP4, and whether or not I will need it to.<p>The clumsy templating syntax. Short tags help, but I'm supposed to feel guilty if I use them.<p>The need to use unreliable third-party software to get bytecode precompilation, causing me to worry about the performance costs of modularity. (!)<p>Magic quotes. And the fact that I may need to undo them depending on the whims of system administrators.<p>Arrays. I wish dictionaries and lists were separate concepts like they are in Python and many other languages I want to interoperate with.<p>The name. I hate when I have to explain what PHP stands for. I feel like enough of a geek as it is.",1176417220
12370,comment,12348,12348,0,0,mattdorey,,,"I saved up and bought a CD burner ($800) when they first came out(grade 7) and started making mix CDs. At the time it was an untapped market because people only had mixed tapes, not CDs!! I had prepackaged Hip Hop, Rock, Alternative, etc. CDs and believe it or not, I charged $20 per CD. It turned into a pretty successful business just at school but then about 1-2 years later when prices came down on burners, the market became comodotized and I had to get out! <p>I'm now 21 and run a successful web-based start up based in Calgary.

12366,comment,12335,12335,0,0,jaggederest,,,"Well, mostly just that PHP has been extended far beyond the simple templating language it was designed as.<p>My language of choice (ruby or haskell, take your pick) was designed for more general tasks, and so is simpler to write the more general web apps people are building now. I would still like to use PHP as my template language, though.<p>PHP is still very fast when it comes to templating, but it's not very fast at all when doing any sort of number crunching. Ruby suffers here, too, which is why I'm trying to use haskell for my current project.",1176416094
12365,comment,12335,12335,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"PHP is pragmatic and pretty fast, but everything, everything, everything, beyond the ""HTML template language"" bits, are bolted on with whatever tools were handy at the moment.  I'd be stunned if more than a couple hours of design work went into the object system, the type system (where == and === are used for evil rather than good), or even the standard library function names.<p>It has some strengths: Big library (not as big or as high quality as CPAN, so if library support is what you need, go for Perl), a lot of example code (but it's mostly horrible quality...even good examples are pretty bad in spots), and really easy deployment.  So, if you're building an Open Source project that you want a lot of people to use, it's a great choice--PHP is available on every hosting server on the planet.  Or, if you need a ""blank-plus-this-widget"" you can probably find the ""blank"" already written in PHP and then build your ""widget"" on top.<p>But, if you're starting from scratch, why commit yourself to working with a shoddy language for the months or years it'll take to finish?  There are good imperative languages out there for web app development: Ruby and Python, in particular.  Though the frameworks craze for these languages are partly to bridge the gap that they have with PHP (they're all missing a ""view"" layer for the web, because PHP is a reasonably powerful, if ugly, template system), and a lot of the other crap just makes things ugly...they get built for one particular application and then stretched for general-purpose use, and in the stretching they get a bit misshapen and hard to fit into any specific task.<p>Anyway, Ruby and Python are pretty and reasonably consistent languages that are nice to work with.  PHP is neither.  Perl...well, it ain't necessarily pretty, but CPAN is hard to beat when you just want to get the job done...and you can treat it as a functional language pretty effectively, which is all the rage around these parts (and you'll probably want to after you see the bolted on object system).",1176416024

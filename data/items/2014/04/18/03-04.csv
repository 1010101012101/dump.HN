The only difference genetic engineering brings is how quickly it can be done.<p>Selective sexual reproduction and genetic engineering are actually markedly different. Genetic engineering involves precise splicing, insertion, or rearrangement of an organism&#x27;s genome (or subset of genes). Selective sexual reproduction is a directed random rearrangement of genetic material over successive generations based (on often poorly understood) &quot;meta-characteristics&quot; or traits.<p>The critical distinction is that genetic engineering is the deliberate editing of exact genetic information, whereas selective sexual reproduction is a gradual, iterated, locally-random mixing of genetic information with imprecise results.<p>Furthermore, genetic engineering enables genetic mixing that aren&#x27;t possible with selective sexual reproduction. For example, the insertion of genetic information into E.coli in order to produce human insulin for diabetics. Or, the modification of a particular cyanobacteria to secrete petroleum after photosynthesis.<p><a href=""http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2014/gc/c3gc42591f#!divAbstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2014/gc/c3gc42...</a><p>>> ...eliminating allergies, Alzheimer&#x27;s, and cancer...<p>> That&#x27;s all been doable for a long time, using controlled breeding...<p>This is incorrect.

Every single individual memory access has to be bounds checked or pushed through some other indirection inside the runtime. Google demonstrated similar ideas with NaCl, which achieved safety with a similarly restricted <i>native code</i> and a just-in-time verification step. Even if these memory accesses could be made as efficient as those performed by the CPUs access protection, you&#x27;re still not <i>gaining</i> anything you don&#x27;t already have.<p>Regarding context switches: A full CPU context switch on x86 (not to ring1 but between two arbitrary points within a single userland address space) takes a few dozen instructions and about 40-80 cycles. A single cache-line miss resulting in a load from main memory on the other hand takes at least twice that (~200 cycles).

7607788,comment,7604787,7605372,1,0,lobster_johnson,,,"I am trying to figure out how Consul meshes with a configuration management system such as Puppet. There is a lot of overlap.<p>From what I can tell, Consul supports two registration mechanisms: Static defined services in /etc/consul.d, and dynamically defined services through the HTTP API.<p>For the statically-defined case, for any given node, you have to create Puppet (or Chef, or whatever) definitions that populate /etc/consul.d with the stuff that&#x27;s going to run on that node. For the actual configuration itself, you still want Puppet to be the one to populate it. The question then is what you gain by doing this; if that configuration goes into Puppet, then Puppet is still the main truth where you want to centralize things, so then you have this flow of data:<p><pre><code>    client <- DNS <- Consul <- /etc/consul.d <- Puppet\n</code></pre>\n...compared to the &quot;old&quot; way:<p><pre><code>    client <- /srv/myapp/myapp.conf-or-whatever <- Puppet\n</code></pre>\nIn this case, Consul&#x27;s benefit comes from the fact that it can know which services are alive and not, so that when myapp needs otherapp, it doesn&#x27;t need a load-balancer to figure that out.<p>The documentation makes a point about Puppet updates being slow and unsynchronized, and it&#x27;s true that you get into situations where, for example, service A is configured with hosts that aren&#x27;t up yet, for example. With Consul you can update the config &quot;live&quot;; surely you want to centralize config in Puppet and populate Consul&#x27;s K/V from Puppet, and then you get the single-point-of-update synchronization missing from Puppet, but you still need to store the truth in Puppet.<p>So I&#x27;m counting two good, but not altogether mind-blowing benefits from using Consul with Puppet, over not using Consul at all. The overlap is looking a lot like two systems vaguely competing for dominance.<p>I suspect the better use of Consul is in conjunction with something like Docker, where you ditch Puppet altogether (except as a way to update the host OS), and instead build images of apps and services that don&#x27;t contain any configuration at all, but simply point themselves at Consul. That means that when you bring up a new Docker container, it can start its Consul agent, register its services, and suddenly its contained services are dynamically available to the whole cluster.<p>The container itself contains no config, no context, just general-purpose application/service code; and Consul doesn&#x27;t need to be populated through Puppet because in that way, Consul is (in conjunction with some container provisioning system) the application world&#x27;s Puppet.<p>That, to me, sounds pretty nice.",1397790839

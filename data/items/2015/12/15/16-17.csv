10738843,comment,10732523,10732523,0,0,awl130,,,"before we shed a tear for these erstwhile celebrities let&#x27;s indeed take a look at the economics. in statistical terms their curse (and I will argue, their blessing) is kurtosis. earnings by entertainers (such as in pro sport, film, TV, music) are not normally distributed but heavily skewed towards the left. the few at the top vastly overperform the rest.  thus you have pewdiepie earning millions and the vast majority losing money.  the same happens in film, for example: the lucky few thousand A-listers earn millions while the millions of other actors bus tables.<p>there are several reasons for this kurtosis: mostly having to do with vertical differentiation---the characteristic in which one product is clearly preferred over another. at the cinema, for example, each movie is priced identically and yet one is clearly preferred than the other.  this leads to a few films becoming runaway successes and the rest barely breaking even.  there is a positive feedback loop that magnifies the effect over time.  you see this quite clearly in the youtube ecosystem as well.  youtube videos are &quot;priced&quot; identically; and so obviously there is a clear preference for one over the other, as there is a clear preference of a performer over another.<p>risky careers are sexy.  these performers may bemoan their situation but in fact it is precisely this kurtosis that gives them their fame. after all the opposite of a kurtocracy is a mediocracy[1], in which rather than the extraordinary dominating, the ordinary dominates.  another fantastic label for such industries is &quot;humdrum&quot; industries[2]. nursing, teaching, bookkeeping, dentistry, engineering, accounting, retail are all mediocracies in which employees do not face extremes of success and failure.  some of these fields are clearly available to youtubers should they find their current path untenable.<p>[1]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_De_Vany"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_De_Vany</a>\n[2]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Caves"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Caves</a>",1450198776

You can use tar, or a windows command line variant of 7z or tar, or a gui.<p>> With out-of-the-box Windows machine, you cannot ssh, you cannot untar, etc.<p>On an out-of-the-box Linux machine, you generally can&#x27;t do a lot of things either. It seems particularly ironic that in a discussion about how we shouldn&#x27;t be using old UNIX tools just because they&#x27;re entrenched, you then call for compatibility.<p>>  Windows-way of doing things is totally different than *nix culture (OS X, Linux, etc).<p>Stupid legacy path limits not included, Powershell is in my experience just a superior way to do things. I should maybe restart my blog to talk about that.<p>But even if we ignore Powershell and windows, your statement is divisive within the Linux community. MANY people prefer shells on Linux that don&#x27;t adhere to the bash legacy. TCSH and CSH are very popular, to this day. Are they &#x27;not interoperable&#x27;?<p>Everyone&#x27;s got a big chip on their shoulder about how development tooling &quot;should be.&quot; One of the things I&#x27;ve come to realize is how arbitrary, unnecessary, and useless these mores are.

Here, design & NRE costs predominate, leading to (very) different constraints on design decisions. In this situation, for example, it might make sense to buy a more expensive materials to make the system easier and faster to design.<p>Software itself isn&#x27;t homogeneous. Different software products may scale in different ways. Embedded Software is different from Enterprise Software which is different from Application Software ... and so on.<p>Some commonality can be seen however. For example, product line engineering can be used to find commonalities and amortize design costs over a set of similar-but-distinct products ... although this is easier to achieve when you are doing bespoke work for clients than when you are producing shrink-wrap applications.<p>Here, you are scaling up over multiple different customisations of a design, (or multiple different members of a design family) rather than individual product elements -- but it is still an economy of scale none the less, and it is still software.",1450198678

10738778,comment,10732861,10738268,0,0,mtviewdave,,,"Recently I was in a car with a friend in Southern California. We were stopped at a red light, needing to make a right turn. On our right were two people standing on the corner. They had activated the crosswalk but were not crossing, instead were focused on their (animated) conversation. Cars were coming from the left. The driver alternated between looking at the pedestrians and looking at the other cars, waiting for the other cars to pass while she also tried to figure out if the pedestrians were going to cross or not.<p>After about 10-12 seconds, the other cars had cleared, and the crosswalk light had switched from the green hand to the red countdown. She started to make the turn, at which point the two pedestrians literally ran into the crosswalk, and in front of her car, with no warning. Apparently they had just noticed the countdown timer and wanted to make it across the intersection without waiting for another cycle.<p>Fortunately she noticed the pedestrians and stopped. The pedestrians continued their run across the intersection, apparently oblivious to the fact that they&#x27;d almost been struck<p>Keeping in mind the following:<p>1. Right turns on red are legal and expected.<p>2. It is illegal for a pedestrian to enter a crosswalk once the countdown timer starts.<p>3. Full evaluation of this intersection required visually evaluating an area of 180-200 degrees, but human beings don&#x27;t have vision that wide, and so it was impossible for the driver to continuously evaluate both the oncoming cars on the left and the pedestrians on the right.<p>4. Drivers in California are trained to look left while making a right turn.<p>What was the driver supposed to do in this scenario? Should the driver have been at fault if she had struck the pedestrians, and if so, why?<p>I was sitting in the passenger seat, so I could evaluate the intersection and see how my friend was evaluating it as well. As far as I could see, she did nothing to violate either California law or driving custom. On the other hand the pedestrians both entered a crosswalk illegally, and also violated section 21950(b) of the California Vehicle Code (which requires pedestrians to exercise due care for their own safety when entering a roadway). So I don&#x27;t think that if she had struck them, she would have been at fault.  But am I wrong? If so, why?",1450198103

The planners in the late 50&#x27;s to mid 60&#x27;s, budgeting out 2*X (where X is likely a largish two digit number) of miles of tunnel boring, likely thought they were making a great money saving decision by not boring a third or fourth tunnel.<p>And since typical human nature is to not think of the &quot;what can go wrong&quot; scenarios before they actually go wrong, those same planners likely never considered the &quot;how do we fix track in tunnel 2 without having to half shut the system down to do so?&quot; aspects of their decisions at the time.",1450197985

This is a great excuse. Make it better, not just ES6ify.<p>Finally, improve your regex by updating certain elements of your code. A good example is moving all var statements to let across whole codebase, and then finding cases where you can 100% use const, and replacing all of those.<p>I&#x27;ve done this update recently (as have a lot of people) and it was great.

There&#x27;s this weird cognitive dissonance going on there because these companies supported so many families for so long. There&#x27;s a sort of one-way loyalty going on. I knew so many friends and family that worked in the auto industry for years, and were all laid off when it went downhill years back.

It was completely hijacked by a union who turned themselves into a &quot;good old boys club&quot; for people from the poor neighborhoods who were born and raised in DC and educated in it&#x27;s horrifically bad public school system.<p>The union once treated the management as the enemy, but once there was no more money left to squeeze from the system itself, they began treating the riders as the enemy.  Fares were raised every 6 months by the time I left, and the system continued to degrade.<p>The racial statistics of the system are clearly indicative of a racial bias in hiring which is a direct result of the good old boy hiring system.<p>New mechanics are iced out in the same way the new managers were by the salary doubling overtime culture the employees practice.  Because to them, a single mechanic working 12 hour shifts is better than two mechanics working 8 hour shifts, despite the former costing the same and doing far, far less than the latter to keep the system operational.<p>I support unions in the private sector.  But my experience dealing with the DC Metro has made me loathe them in any public monopoly where consumers have no way to choose a competitor when the union gets out of hand and starts siphoning money from them.<p>My favorite, glaring example which is a tiny sliver of what occurs courtesy of the union:<p>A bus driver, several years ago, randomly pulled his bus over when he saw a person in a &quot;McGruff the crime dog&quot; costume talking to children about drugs.  He assaulted McGruff, and then got back on his bus and continued operations.<p>The union forced the WMATA to rehire him, WITH BACKPAY.  He still works there, serving the public.

Traffic on I-66/495/395 is so ungodly bad that even when Metro is single-track for repairs it&#x27;s still on par or even slightly faster than traffic. And that&#x27;s on a <i>good</i> traffic day; it&#x27;s worse when it&#x27;s raining. Not to mention the standard issue with finding and paying out the nose for parking once you&#x27;ve driven into DC. Metro doesn&#x27;t have a huge incentive to provide better service because even with ridership being down 5% it&#x27;s probably not going to dip much further since Metro riders have no alternative.<p>I think DC is also semi-unique in the makeup of its commuters since inside the beltway is such a hub for employers and a large number of employees are happy to have an hour+ commute each way. The cost of real estate is so ridiculously high around here that you don&#x27;t start seeing 3+ BR townhomes becoming accessible on anything other than a VP+ salary until about 15 miles out from downtown DC. If you want a freestanding home over 1000sft the affordability distance becomes 20+ miles.<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen a vast majority of people will do whatever contortions they need to in their personal lives to get and keep a government/ government contractor job because those jobs have incredible stability (contractor not as much as working directly for the government, however that depends on what contractor you work for). Once you&#x27;ve got the coveted federal job you&#x27;re happy to live in a basement 20 miles from the city on your entry-level pay tier because if you can just grin and bear it long enough you&#x27;ll be almost guaranteed employment for life. Those employees can, do, and will continue to use Metro despite every problem it has because sitting in their car on I66 for an hour is not a viable alternative.",1450195759

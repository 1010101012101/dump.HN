They're donated to parties or individuals to use as they see fit, allowing year-on-year cumulative effects.<p>In that case it seems even <i>less</i> likely that this proposal will work.  The major political parties will receive such a large proportion of the funds that they need only spend a fraction of those funds to get elected, and can accumulate much of those funds for future elections.  Meanwhile, the third parties need all the money they can get just to get anyone to remember their name.<p>> When something big about a system changes, there is some burden of proof on those claiming it will have no effect (there is also a burden of proof on those claiming it will have a particular effect, but we've not really gotten there yet).<p>I'd argue that as in any other instance of a proposed solution to a problem, the default assumption remains ""this will have no effect"", and it falls to the proposers of the solution to argue convincingly why it will work.",1324061999

3361790,comment,3361181,3361346,1,0,mikegreenberg,,,"There are a few people who have already commented about what is happening in South Florida. (And there is a lot of activity...) Here is a good thread to follow as it stood earlier this year: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2545955"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2545955</a><p>Separately, Brian Breslin (who's been involved here for quite a few years now) has recently written a blog post about it that is another perspective on it: <a href=""http://brianbreslin.com/on-building-a-community/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brianbreslin.com/on-building-a-community/</a><p>I've also been talking about writing this post for some time now and have never found the time to dig in and do it, but I'll mention some of the highlights that I'd discuss:<p>- There is an overwhelming interest from many different parts of the community (even those outside of tech) to grow the entrepreneurial and technical skill here in South Florida. City development, local business, chamber of commerce, non-profits, universities, and individual leaders are all quite active in putting on events and getting really great people involved here. (Case-in-point: Rasmus Lerdorf just gave two talks about PHP this week. Zed Shaw was in town back in March for Miami Tech Week. Dave McClure was here some weeks ago at a Biz Dev/VC conference.)<p>- There are people looking for talent and qualified talent is still difficult to find. I'm personally looking for CTO/entrepreneurs for the two groups I'm advising. Both have some capital and have a strong likelihood of success, IMHO. Companies are hiring here as well! Well established companies doing interesting work! (Senzari, for example, is based in Miami.) It wouldn't be hard to find work, if you aren't picky. And if you have time, you can find a really interesting job within months.<p>- The community wants to be stronger; to be on par with the likes of NY, Boston, Seattle, SV; but they don't always get involved. Turn-out at events is really hit and miss depending on location, timing and topic matter. I attribute this to a few things: poor city layout making it difficult to get people outside of a 10-15 mile radius to your event, good intentions and no follow-up...<p>- The tech leadership doesn't support each other as much as I think they should. If you're well-connected and know the right people, there's sure to be resources shared; but otherwise, there's a lot of work that community organizers needs to make to coordinate events and pool efforts across the community.<p>- Despite these things, the leadership here puts together really great events on a consistent basis: TEDxMIA (<a href=""http://tedxmia.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tedxmia.com</a>) , SuperConf (<a href=""http://superconf.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://superconf.net</a>), Refresh Miami (<a href=""http://refreshsofla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://refreshsofla.org</a>), South Florida Hack and Tell (my own meetup) (<a href=""http://hackandtell.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackandtell.org</a>), a whole slew of events on <a href=""http://miamitechevents.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://miamitechevents.com/</a> and they keep coming!<p>Overall, I think South Florida could be a really successful area to live in professionally. The momentum as been positive and people definitely care. If I had an extra 5-10 hours a week, I would dedicate that to helping the community become more cohesive and better connected. There's no reason why events couldn't be cross-promoted and sponsorship within the community be more prevalent than it is today.",1324061899

3361780,comment,3359498,3361098,10,0,grandalf,,,"What choice did Marx have but to advocate the use of <i>force</i> to prevent capitalists from gaining power and taking control?<p>Marx acknowledged that Capitalism works extremely well for wealth creation, and it was the consequences of this that he tried to address. If you view the inevitable phenomenon as a really bad thing for society, then of course force seems reasonable.<p>I think it's fair to argue that the crushing weight of the social hierarchy often feels extremely violent to those at the bottom.<p>In order to ignore this, we Capitalists must either convince ourselves that each is harmoniously filling his role, or that each generation (at the bottom) is better off, or that life isn't fair, etc.  By being unwilling to ignore this or adopt one of the easy explanations, Marx doesn't introduce force/violence into the political process, he just stops pretending it's not there.<p>So generally the Marxist view in the modern world (where social upheaval is quite unlikely) means that we are willing to consider toppling established institutions. It is for this reason that I credit the tea party (in its opposition to the Fed, etc.) as a Marxist group.  Would shutting down the Fed be an act of violence (even if enacted by congress)? Arguably yes, since it would harshly and abruptly change the distribution of wealth.  Abstractly changing the distribution of wealth via policy is in a sense identical to sending an armed thug to everyone's door who either demands money or offers money.  You see where this is going, but my point is that I think it's possible (and advisable) to focus most of our attention on soft violence, not stuff like Lenin did, since that is the prevailing legacy of Marx in modern life, unfettered by the complications of past wars, dictators, etc.",1324061792

If I say ""even if you open four envelopes first and find them empty"" (I still guarantee you will be surprised on the fifth) I'm in a way implying that that has a non-zero probability.<p>The way to formalize this is to say so.  ""This is a stochastic process, there is a non-zero chance that you will go through four days without a test (have it on the fifth day"".<p>Obviously, you cannot make this guarantee, while guaranteeing surprise in 100% of cases.<p>So basically, the only intuitive problem this puzzle poses is that it sounds like the teacher is giving you some kind of guarantee that there is a case where you open four empty envelopes before opening the fifth with the heart in it.<p>In fact there is no such guarantee.<p>So, really, my cases A and B can be summarized as follows.<p>A) In case the teacher makes any guarantee that there is a non-zero chance of a test on Friday and that this chance is assured by a stochastic process, he CANNOT 100% guarantee surprise.<p>This was my original, knee-jerk interpretation.  Of course, the teacher does not ACTUALLY make any such guarantee!!!  By saying ""test-day = Monday"" he has gone back on his word that there is a non-zero chance the test is on Friday: in fact there is a zero chance of that.<p>Version B, in which he does not guaranteee a non-zero chance on any day of the week, leaves the teacher able to fulfill both his obligations (surprise and test on a weekday) without a paradox.<p>Really, this is INSANELY clear and simple when you view it clearly.

3361747,comment,3361158,3361668,7,0,angersock,,,"I'd suggest something like the following:<p>Treat this like a software development project, except we're coming up with a government instead of a program.<p>1. Setup a public bugtracker, where people can submit examples of federal government acting incorrectly (attached to bugs, have relevant news articles, studies, and impacts for why it is important).<p>2. Setup a repo with a ""blessed"" version of the founding documents of the government. Anyone can read the docs, and suggest changes. Any changes to the laws would have an easy-to-follow path in the changelog, and linked tickets from the bug tracker demonstrating that they were necessary. These docs can be forked, but the blessed branch gets the ""official"" reference implementation.<p>We've had the tools to ""fix"" government for years now--we should start using them.<p><i>Things I'd personally like to see:</i><p>1. Who controls the ""blessed"" version? This is a hilariously interesting problem, and likely would end up with some kind of set of ""core"" developers. That said, we have the tech to make relatively authenticated, secure votes (PGP or somesuch). I'd suggest using that to accept changes to mainline, and if it becomes obvious the core devs aren't paying attention we fork. This might be really slow to get things accomplished (past the initial bootstrap), but that's okay in government--the more conservative your creation of policies, the better.<p>2. A creation of a structured query language for determining if an action obeys a law. This would be really tricky, but if the core docs can unambiguously be parsed and tested against so many problems in government simply go away. I don't really expect this to get done, but it's an intriguing idea, no?<p>3. My personal belief is that a good government is like a good operating system: it provides basic infrastructure when you need it, is invisible when you aren't looking for it, and protects you from other things in the environment (and them from you!). So, a lean, simple, easily-verifiable government that protects basic rights and provides basic needs and which only intervenes when processes (groups) come into direct conflict seems like the correct goal--not this bloated ill-defined overreaching contraption we have today.",1324061456

Despite this, I have no particular bias for RIM that I'm aware of, and couldn't see myself owning any of the products they currently produce. I've also never worked for RIM, but I have a number of close friends who have for co-op work terms.<p>There are a lot of things wrong with RIM, but I think the author of this article missed most of them, focusing largely on a bunch of points that were either irrelevant or incorrect.<p>First of all, as many have mentioned, Waterloo is not located in the rural heart of Canada, nor is there a particularly huge problem finding talent in the area. Like many universities we have a co-op work program during which students find employment at a variety of companies including Microsoft, Apple and Google. Bill Gates has stated that ""Most years, we hire more students out of Waterloo than any university in the world, typically 50 or even more""[1]. This leads me to believe that it's not a lack of available talent that has plagued RIM, but the ability to attract and retain it.<p>Each term, RIM hires hundreds of students for co-op work terms. From a student's perspective, it doesn't feel particularly challenging to get a job there the same way it would for Google or Facebook. For this reason, I suspect the best and brightest of our classes likely end up working in the States, rather than sticking around here.<p>There are certainly some cultural issues at play here. Many of the people I knew who worked at RIM were never challenged by their work or held accountable for it and this lead to an incredibly low productivity. I've known people that show up to work there drunk occasionally and high consistently. That same individual went to work at a smaller mobile company his following term and was working unpaid overtime on weekends simply because he enjoyed the work. Of course, this is all anecdotal, but it paints a picture for me about what working for the company must be like.<p>In my opinion, RIM needs to hire fewer students, and pay them more competitively. They need to hold their employees accountable for productivity and team leaders and managers accountable for the people they oversee.<p>All this being said, I sometimes can't help but wonder if RIM's problems are over-exaggerated. True, they're losing market share, but they're still profitable on the order of billions aren't they?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20051013/billgates_waterloo_20051013/#ixzz1gitjhEDV"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20051013/billgates_waterloo...</a>",1324060812

I felt like an idiot for buying something that was a POS on the promise that eventually it would be fixed and would be great.<p>Over the years, I've amassed piles of kit that at the time I bought them weren't very good, but would be made ""better"" over time (drawer full of Maemo tablets; I'm looking squarely at you).<p>I've had to become more cut-throat now. I don't buy something unless it actually works and does what I want it to at the time I buy it.<p>If the thought of your Android phone (or any device) never being updated (or not being updated quickly) makes you not want to buy it, then don't buy it. I know it's made difficult by the fact that presently there's an arms race in mobile phones, and things are still getting better frequently; but I really think you'll be avoiding frustration if you just base your decisions around what the device does here and now.<p>Odds are; they aren't going to stop drinking, or get in shape, or resolve their childhood issues, or become a dog person.

Those DOM APIs would once again be written in an event-based way.<p>The ""big existing libraries of blocking code"" would be inconsequential since they would for the most part have nothing to do with the kinds of things you are doing on the web.

This lead to easy explanation of the paradox. The teacher might as well hand out an exam on a red piece or paper and claim that <i>that</i> is a surprise.<p>The second is that the teacher invalidly presumes to be able to predict the mental state of his students. This can be stated simply: over the weekend, all his students die unexpectedly. The following week, none of his student are surprised since the set of surprised students is empty.<p>We can work around those two flaw by ignoring the no-student case and assuming that ""surprised"" is replaced by a more exact formulation: ""on the day the exam occurs, nobody would be able to say ``I knew the exam was today''"".<p>In this formulation, I contend that nothing can be concluded.<p>The reason for this is that induction can only be applied on facts. The future is not a fact, so to apply induction on a sequence of future events is an error. The only conclusion that one can reach is the contrafactual: if we were Friday then the exam cannot occur on Friday. This is because the reasoning does not rely on any inductive argument but rely only on things that would be facts inside the contrafactual: if we were on Friday now, it would be false that the exam cannot be held on that day and that nobody could say that the exam is to be held that day.<p>A contrafactual of this nature cannot be built for Thursday, since in <i>that</i> contrafactual (""if we were Thursday..."") one would have to reason by induction about teh future. Of course, in the Thursday-contrafactual, one could state the Friday-contrafactual, but you can't build inudction on contrafactual (i.e. non-fact).",1324059200

    print ""It's "", today, "" today.""

Now you run this program 1,000,000 times.  If instead of DayOfTest = Monday we made it random monday through friday, then on the Fridays, the student would know it's that day, and we would trip the PARADOX!!! error message.  In other words, we would only have an 80% guarantee.  In 20% of cases we would trip a paradox. (since STUDENT ERROR!! is never tripped, it's a true paradox and not a mistaken student algorithm.).<p>But if you run the pseudocode as-is above a million times, the student would NEVER get to say, on a Friday, that they are sure it's that day.  You would not print a single PARADOX!!!! error message.  Because you don't print a single paradox, we don't have to remove that day (reducing the possible spaces from five to four) to avoid it.<p>Do you see?  If the pseudocode has the teacher giving the day as random monday through friday, then he can only give an 80% guarantee of not tripping a paradox.<p>but if the teacher can have a secret algorithm (giving the test on Monday) then the student's very first line of reasoning fails: they do not get to trip any paradox error messages or, in order to remove these error messages, remove any possible days from the space.",1324058956

BrowserLab/BrowserShots is not enough because they just offer screenshots, and don't tell me if an interaction is broken (i.e. a certain plugin doesn't fire, clicking a link doesn't behave as intended, etc.). Parallels/Fusion, among other things, doesn't help me account for different screen sizes. And Selenium-based solutions are more complicated than they should be.<p>So I'll get 10 people to review one main page on your site (e.g. a landing page; a new feature you're pushing, etc.) and either tell you everything is fine or point out errors along with a screenshot. This is for free and for the first 20 HN'ers to either email or comment below asking for this.

Similarly the droid will have exactly the same signal from satellite, only delayed.<p>When commercial GPS-devices begin to locate themselves, they need four satellites for the process: Three for the coordinates and one for time. I believe, that military system works the same way.

So it does not cover the general idea of a mousetrap but of the specific method of catching mice with a spring loaded trap.<p>(the method I described above works, very well, assuming the sides are slippery/smooth enough for the mouse to be unable to climb them) - my dad tried catching a mouse alive when I was a kid to show me; he tried 4-5 times, and it caught a mouse each time, but all of them were dead when we found them - we never figured out if it was from the very limited fall or from the shock or what it was).",1321613875

About 90 attendants, 45-50 pitches. Some were good, some were bad, some were clones (groupon anyone?). I joined a great team led by the (then) Brussels director of Founder Institute and had an amazing time. We ended up second (should have been first, but I won't go into details) and that was that. He made a company out of it and recently raised $2m, moving all operations to Sillicon Valley (he is from SV originally, but lived in Brussels for a couple years). You might've read about it on TC. Company is Scanadu, @scanadude on Twitter.<p>Startup Weekend Brussels #2: october 2011
Fully booked, I'd say about 90 still showed up. If I have to guess, only 25-30 pitches, most were terrible. Ideas chosen were quite bad, a couple opportunistic people won the pitches which is okay I suppose. The one idea which I liked (I kid you not: one) was one I had actually worked on before, before the ""founder"" disappeared and we just faded. Pretty good project, but from the pitch I could tell the focus was wrong. They also had too much interest (well over 10% of all votes!!) and a team that was too big, so I went home and didn't come back.<p>All in all, worth trying. Go see what's going on, it could be a lifechanging experience.

Unfortunately, this is not what we are dealing with.<p>Let's, for example, assume you generously donate a given sum every month, to Greenpeace. According to you logic, nobody can say you support them.<p>Microsoft pays the fees required by their BSA membership and allow the entity to brag abput their membership. The entity's charter is to defend the interests of their members and one of the ways to do it is supporting SOPA. How can anyone say, considering Microsoft's previous support to PIPA and their support to BSA, that they don't support SOPA?<p>How likely is that Microsoft would chose not to comment and, at the same time, be against SOPA? The odds of that are vanishingly small.<p>About the first part of your last message, you never kept it  really secret ;-)",1321611830

The bottom line is, the UI is barely serviceable, there are performance, stability, and battery life issues <i>galore</i> - serious, deal-breaking ones.<p>This goes beyond what the device is and isn't ""meant to be"". This goes right to whether or not it is a competent personal electronic device. My answer leans towards ""no"".<p>I had the Kindle Fire drain 50% of my battery idling over night. The culprit? I dared set up email on the device - yes, one of those big advertised features right there on the Fire's home page.<p>The UI is unresponsive. Not only is it jerky and laggy, but buttons routinely stop responding altogether. Using the device is a chore, since you're never sure if you hit a button it'll actually <i>do</i> something, or if you'll have to jab the screen again and see what happens.<p>We'll ignore <i>all</i> the myriad UI design problems with the device and excuse it, since it's $200 and apparently that means it's supposed to be able to get away with atrocious UI.<p>The music player is terrible. When reading books or otherwise moving about the device the music will cut out and randomly fast forward. That's disregarding the myriad of UI problems (including sorting ""The Beatles"" under ""T"").<p>The reader app, and the video app, are the <i>only</i> two things in the entire device that I'd consider a win.

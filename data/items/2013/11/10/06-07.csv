6705592,comment,6704377,6704677,3,0,smsm42,,,"I&#x27;ve read your first link and I can&#x27;t make much sense for it. They state Latino students are falling behind and they are out to help them - which is a noble goal and would benefit everybody, as basic education is associated with improving virtually every aspect of life of oneself and surroundings. However I can not see how this could be improving by teaching students something like &quot;ethnic studies&quot;, whatever this is. Maybe in Arizona they have some different ones, but so far all examples of ethnic studies I&#x27;ve seen could help people be a professor of ethnic studies and not much more, and demand for those is not high enough to support teaching this in schools. I highly doubt teaching something like &quot;Pedagogy of the Oppressed&quot;, which is written by a Marxist and starts with the presumption the audience is &quot;oppressed&quot;, is going to contribute much to the success of the students in American society. This btw has nothing to do with author being white or not white (I have no idea if he is) or &quot;white&quot; people being offended (most of any people never heard about this book anyway).<p>I&#x27;m not a big fan of the government prescribing what to teach to the children, but if you have government-run schools, that&#x27;s what you get. As government intervention goes, I don&#x27;t think something like: &quot;The legislature finds and declares that public school pupils should be taught to treat and value each other as individuals and not be taught to resent or hate other races or classes of people.&quot; (this is mentioned as one of the laws that for some reason prevents &quot;ethnic studies&quot; from being taught) is the worst example of it. I have hard time figuring out why one would object to such premise and insist that pupils in government schools should be taught racial hate or resentment.",1384066396

This mechanism might help explain why sodium hasn&#x27;t <i>consistently</i> been shown to have an adverse effect in humans while at the same time still being strongly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

6705573,comment,6705517,6705517,12,0,laughfactory,,,"Your conclusion is probably true. Though I didn&#x27;t go to a &quot;top public school,&quot; I followed a similar path and had a similar concern at about the same point in my path through college. I should&#x27;ve chosen otherwise, but instead I chose to finish my economics degree and find a job working for a bank. I can assure you that there are plenty of good jobs working for banks all across the country. Sure, they may not be the elite positions in investment banking on Wall Street, but lets be honest, most people who work in banking and finance don&#x27;t work on Wall Street. So if you continue to pursue you existing path, you&#x27;ll find there is plenty of opportunity in banking. Depending on the role and the area, entry-level pay runs between $40-$50k. After a couple years experience you can generally get $60k. It&#x27;s not the mountains of riches you dream of while in college, but it&#x27;s a good living.<p>That said, I&#x27;ve discovered on &quot;the outside&quot; (of college) that I don&#x27;t really like being the analytics guy, the banker. I&#x27;d much rather build products, make things, have skills which enable me to <i>do</i>. Often, work in banking (be it sales or analytics or underwriting or finance or whatever) can feel pretty disconnected from the real world. For instance, I&#x27;ve worked in risk management, and now in credit administration, and while I&#x27;m very good at what I do, it doesn&#x27;t excite me the way building products for the web does.<p>The key, in your position, is to determine what drives you. Do you like being the analytics/numbers/finance guy who is a whiz with spreadsheets, analytics, finance/accounting, etc? Or deep down do you harbor the desire to make things: software, web apps, mobile apps, etc.<p>At this point, put aside concerns about making tons of money or being &quot;successful&quot; after graduation. Thinking about those things will just muddy your thinking. And the truth is that there&#x27;s good money to be made in either arena.<p>Think about whether you want to analyze or build and I think you&#x27;ll have the answer to your question.<p>In my case, I&#x27;ve often wished I would&#x27;ve made the transition no matter the cost, so that I could be working in software development now. Since I didn&#x27;t I now have to pursue a long-game of developing the skill-set on my own and eventually slowly working my way into the field.<p>It sounds like you expect all banking positions to pay a ton, be on Wall Street, require 100+ hours a week (and 3 emails/cold-calls a day), etc. This is certainly not the case in any of the non-Wall Street positions I&#x27;ve worked. I&#x27;ve always worked no more than 40 hours a week, received decent benefits, good salary, paid bank holidays, competent co-workers, etc.<p>I&#x27;m sure positions like you describe exist, I just don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re indicative of the vast majority of the banking and finance industry. Broaden your perspective and you might like what you find.<p>If not then yes, commit to change gears. Particularly if you really enjoy the software development stuff (like I always have). Don&#x27;t focus on whether you do well at it, but instead on whether it is rewarding to you. If it&#x27;s not rewarding to you (software development related classes) then you&#x27;ll hate working as a software developer. However, if you find the programming you do in those classes rewarding then definitely make the switch, because the banking/finance world can be a very frustrating place for someone who&#x27;d rather be making things with code. You have some semi-technical skill-sets which may or may not get any respect, there can be a lot of egos run rampant, and banks are notoriously slow to adapt and innovate.<p>That said, if you can find meaning in the banking line of work, it&#x27;s not a &quot;bad&quot; gig per se, it&#x27;s just not quite as satisfying personally as programming is.",1384065744

Mark is not really a PR guy and you can tell - a lot of what he has done has just kind of fanned the flames. I don&#x27;t think I need to remind you, but even in a sarcastic tone, &quot;open source tea party&quot; and &quot;we have root&quot; are inflammatory things to say. I think he addresses some of these problems pretty well in this post, and I think he deserves the benefit of the doubt here. Think about all that he has accomplished and the amount that Ubuntu has helped the Linux community grow.<p>So kudos to him for having the balls to apologize. I accept that apology, and I think that a lot of people (including myself) have had some venomous things to say about him as well as Canonical which probably weren&#x27;t fair. So we could probably all back off here and focus on the real issues.<p>...but...<p>He&#x27;s still not talking about the two elephants in the room.<p>The Unity lens is fundamentally fucked up. It should be opt-in. Period. It&#x27;s clearly an infringement on users&#x27; privacy and totally not in the spirit of libre software or Linux. I can&#x27;t really trust Canonical - even though they&#x27;ve given us all so much - because of this issue. So long as they don&#x27;t back down from this I&#x27;m going to look at everything they do with a critical and possibly cynical eye... it just <i>clearly</i> looks like they&#x27;re selling out their users. It is really just sad to see them selling out to Amazon like this, and I wish it didn&#x27;t have to be this way. I can&#x27;t really fathom the amount of money Mark has spent on Ubuntu. I don&#x27;t really know how he can make it work as a business. But the Amazon search in the lens just seems like a morally wrong and short-sighted way to go.<p>The second issue which we all need to address is Mir. The technical arguments are <i>completely over my head</i>, but I feel like Canonical hasn&#x27;t fully made the case for why they&#x27;ve decided to fragment the community and do their own thing. This could just be me not understanding what&#x27;s going on, but pretty much everyone who&#x27;s developing this stuff seems to be on Wayland&#x27;s side... why is that (and is that)? It&#x27;s worth considering, but I feel like Canonical should be engaging the community, although with all the flaming that goes on I can see why they don&#x27;t. We all want the best free software we can get, but some serious thought needs to be devoted to the ramifications and rationale for having two display servers.<p>So that&#x27;s the end of this long rant - let me know what you think.",1384064977

There may be a recurring cast of similar bovine, but they aren&#x27;t characters in the same way Calvin and Hobbes are. Is C&H more worthy of copyright protection? Copying any one comic would be violation of copyright, but if I make another comic with talking cows, no one will say that I sole from the Far Side... well they may say it, but it would be hard to prove.<p>Once published, these original works become part of our culture. If someone draws a young boy with a stuffed tiger and makes no claim that the characters are to depict Calvin and Hobbes, how can someone claim that they are protected from copyright anymore so than taking cows?<p>If I have the choice of buying a t-shirt that Bill Watterson illustrated, or some knock-off imitation that claims to be illustrated by Bill Watterson, Bill should be able to sue to protect his name. But if the illustration makes no claim to have been authored by Bill Watterson, why shouldn&#x27;t this be allowed? Side by side on a clothing rack, I&#x27;d buy the official C&H design over an imitation, provided that the official design was the funnier shirt. If the &quot;imitation&quot; design is funnier, then do we as a culture not benefit from what would today be categorized as copyright infringement?<p>With Full Screen Mario, no claim is made that this is created by Nintendo. If you recolored the art, so that Mario had purple overalls and a yellow shirt, is that sufficiently different? At what point has something been altered enough so that the derivative work isn&#x27;t a &quot;copy?&quot; Can Nintendo lay claim to the color palette chosen?<p>The reality is that the line drawn between what is the original and what is copyright infringement is indefinable. More to the point, it is a legal question answered by a court, and therefore an objective decision. Characters are just as much a part of the culture as are the style and format. It just so happens that our current laws favor the protection of characters. If your character is  overwhelmingly recognizable in &quot;derivative&quot; works, copyright holders can claim infringement, even when copying wasn&#x27;t a part of the creative process. Even if the &quot;derivative&quot; work is substantially different in terms of how the asset is used.<p>As a culture, we really need to reflect upon why we have copyright protection in the first place. I&#x27;m convinced that it is causing more harm than good. Copyright is meant to expire so that the culture can build upon concepts and ideas that are still relatable to the culture in which the original was established. 25 years is more than ample time for the original copyright owner to have benefited from an idea. There is no harm to our culture if those ideas are allowed to flourish under the stewardship of others. With the accelerated pace or society evolves today, 25 years is downright ancient.<p>Full Screen Mario is obviously intended to look and feel like the original game Nintendo published 30 years ago, but so much has changed since then. If Nintendo created Super Mario Brothers today, and they were just getting into the gaming industry, I don&#x27;t think they would have even built the game using web technologies... they probably would have created a game that runs on cellphones and tablets and they would have called the game Angry Birds.<p>Rovio understands current copyright law as much as anyone, which is why their games have recognizable characters. Sling shots can be replaced with catapults and birds could be replaced with squirrels, and no one would mistake that game for Angry Birds, even with similar game play mechanics. If you were to put a red bird with a yellow beak in a racing game, I would be terribly surprised if the creators of the driving game weren&#x27;t sued. Has our culture been harmed in either instance? Has Rovio been damaged in one instance more than the other? Does our culture benefit from any of this copyright debate?",1384064928

By threatening the livelihood of any person who says something that offends a progressive who thinks the statement might offend someone of a protected class, PC has a chilling effect on the college classroom. See &quot;The Hidden Impact of Political Correctness&quot;[1]<p>&quot;What can be done? One option to embrace the PC party line at every opportunity since those who object (i.e., conservatives, Christian fundamentalists) stoically forbear this nonsense and lack the supporting indignation infrastructure. But, for those disinclined to fake it, the only viable option is to avoid anything that might be mangled into offensiveness. Purging the course is hardly fool-proof, but it is relatively undemanding, almost morally painless and students rarely notice the difference.<p>Let me offer a first-hand example. I once taught the basic American government lecture course and Constitution lecture covered the three-fifths compromise - the Article I, Section 2 provision that counted &quot;other persons&quot; (i.e., slaves and untaxed Indians - blacks are never mentioned by name ) as three-fifths of a person for purposes of House representation. I explained that Southerners wanted to treat slaves as a whole person since this would sharply boost their representation while abolitionist New Englanders proposed counting slaves as zero. Unfortunately, this three-fifths provision has now been interpreted by some black activists (including an African American colleague who stated her misinformed opinion in a public law school lecture) as &quot;proof&quot; of America&#x27;s racist origins. Black students have probably encountered this historical mistruth elsewhere (Jesse Jackson once endorsed it) and it does appear superficially plausible.<p>Rather than risk being accused of covering up racism or telling lies, I dropped the topic altogether. I similarly removed all discussion of slavery so students thus never learned that the while the Constitution did not outlaw slavery, it did permit a ban on importing slaves after 1808 and this was, indeed, done - which, in turn, made those slaves already in America exceedingly costly and thus at times too valuable to risk at dangerous labor (I further skipped how the ever-plentiful Irish were instead hired for life-threatening jobs).&quot;<p>Meanwhile, left-wing students steeped in Political Correctness regularly attempt to shut down and silence speakers that offend them. Recently students at Brown University shouted down a former NYC police commissioner[2] that came to speak at the campus, calling him a &quot;racist&quot; in response to NYC&#x27;s very successful stop-and-frisk policy designed to get illegal guns off the street. It used to be said that the antidote to bad speech was more speech. Now, the PC lynch mob is feeling its power, since its members know that university administrators will not discipline progressives.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mindingthecampus.com/originals/2007/09/the_hidden_impact_of_political.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mindingthecampus.com/originals/2007/09/the_hidden...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/362874/how-now-brown-kow-tow-jack-fowler"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/362874/how-now-brown-ko...</a>",1384063708

For the longest time, I&#x27;ve held this idea that because all of the bigwigs got their MBAs, and they got them from top schools, that that was what I needed to do. In other words, to become the person I wanted to be, I had to go get an MBA.<p>My thoughts have tempered as I moved progressively towards more technical roles: Business Intelligence, Ops Research, Systems Architecture, etc. In fact, I&#x27;ve started to grow a disdain for the average MBA, not unlike the disdain you hear from a lot of people with backgrounds in CS. The thing is, I&#x27;ve never been anything but a business-end guy...I shouldn&#x27;t feel that way about business-guys.<p>My own observation on the cause has to do with the toolsets that are given to your typical MBA. Their Root Cause Analysis tools assume that everything has a singular root cause, but those analyses fail when the problem is of combinatorial complexity, where you often have multiple root causes for a problem. Business optimization tends to fall solely on LP models, which again, fail under combinatorial complexity scenarios. Pareto analysis is fine until you have pareto&#x27;d your entire business and all that you have left are a bunch of bugs and quality flaws that only affect a tiny minority of orders by themselves, but 100% of orders in aggregate. The entire MBA toolset itself seems to be a result of pareto optimization (a set of tools to use for 80% of the scenarios you will come across as a business leader).<p>Furthermore, I now feel as though the wisdom of any singular person can very easily become overrated, and in the case of top level execs, is almost invariably overrated. As I became involved with Business Intelligence at my last job, I kept running into execs who always had the same mindset: just give me the data, and I will make the decision that will save the day. The problem is, the skillset to extract, transform, prettify, and graph out data is very often the same skillset that can make provably optimal decisions, or at least better-than-human decisions. Why should they spend so much of their time satisfying executive egos by giving them a precious jewel of data that they will just blow with a swagged decision, when they could be applying Machine Learning or Mathematical Optimization instead?<p>Your average smart guy with an MBA will continue to provide value in specific scenarios. The Technology industry (as long as &quot;Technology&quot; implies working with intractably difficult problems) will rarely be one of them. And just for good measure, I&#x27;ll caveat that one more time, especially since my current employer has a ton of exceptions: not all MBAs ...",1384063586

In those cases the cyclist is also blatantly disregarding others and their own safety, which is why every single one of those accidents the cyclist was getting a ticket because it was also illegal to cycle on the roads (they had a speed limit >35mph).<p>Things are definitely far more difficult to balance, simply because there are also many places where the road conditions don&#x27;t allow a cyclist to exist safely (no shoulder, high speed limit, and less than 300ft visibility).",1384063249

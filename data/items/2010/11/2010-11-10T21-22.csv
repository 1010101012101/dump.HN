This would be unfortunate<p>* Google could provide google UIDs instead of emails when downloading contacts. This is theoretically and practically enough to reconstruct the social graph as well. Every company could use their own UID for downloads instead of emails. I do not think it would be practical to reconstruct a social graph across companies however.

For instance, if the prisoners decided that everyone would just open boxes 1-50, then they would have zero chance of finding all 100 names (since 50 of the boxes would never even be opened).  It seems like the best they can do to maximize their chances is to make sure that each box is tried exactly 50 times.  One way to do that is to divide the prisoners into two groups of 50, then assign the first group to boxes 1-50 and the second group to boxes 51-100.  Then the chances that the first group all find their names is 1/2^50 (not 100% sure about this number, but it seems reasonable) - and if the first group all find their names, then the second group will too (since if all 50 in the first group were found in boxes 1-50, then all 50 in the second group must be in boxes 51-100).

1891809,comment,1889773,1890031,0,0,anatoly,,,"I strongly advise against trying to learn physics from this book. Trust me, while the idea looks magnificent in theory, it's a horrible book to try and learn from for someone who doesn't have the mathematical and physical background. It just isn't possible, and yes, even if you're very, very smart and talented. Despite the fact that theoretically it's self-contained, you really need an equivalent of a PhD in math or mathematical physics to approach this book; but if you do have that background, there are better specialized textbooks.<p>The whole thing is basically a massive exercise in vanity. I wouldn't be surprised if it actually were the most unread book published recently, in relative terms (that is, the most percent of people who bought it didn't end up reading any substantial part of it).",1289423721

Or on my ""future"" activity.  Or the date range of my ""present"" activity.  So I created the site!<p>There's a lot more features I can add too (mobile, better UIX, edit log, follow user, better feedback threads, better tagging, alerts and notifications).<p>I also added auto categorization of the posts, which doesn't always work, but is fun :)<p>The site influences are twitter.com, facebook.com, foodspotting.com, dailybooth.com and hotpotato.com.<p>I guess I'm the kind of person that likes to document everything!<p>I also like to read what other people are doing in their life, so I can learn from them.<p>If you have time, please logon, give it a try, and let me know what you think.<p>I appreciate it!<p>Best Always,

If your device has existing drivers that will run on an OS in a VM, you can use USB passthrough (most virtualisers including VirtualBox) to run it on top of Linux, which comes with a USB logging module called ""usbmon"" (<a href=""http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/usb/usbmon.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/usb/usbmon.txt</a>).<p>There are also software loggers for Windows such as ""Snoopy Pro"" but last time I tried that it dropped certain types of packets.

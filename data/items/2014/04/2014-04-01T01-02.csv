7505686,comment,7504296,7504902,1,0,Zancarius,,,"> FYI: This is how you can have an eminently nice person with nothing but respect for the intrinsic human rights and dignity of homosexuals, but who still votes for Prop 8 or Amendment 1 or a similar measure.<p>I think this is where the problem crops up. Many of the people commenting here see things as strictly black-and-white. Opposition to gay marriage is bigotry, support for gay marriage is sunshine and roses.<p>The problem is that it&#x27;s impossible to reason with anyone who takes such a stance, because many of the arguments raised here are suggestive that <i>any form of opposition to gay marriage</i> is illustrative of hatred and bigotry against gays. There is absolutely no middle ground. Which is rather ironic, because the <i>other</i> arguments raised accuse the opponents of gay marriage of doing precisely the same thing and accepting no middle ground!<p>In another thread last week, I recall a particular discussion that implicitly suggested that those who believe the state shouldn&#x27;t recognize <i>any</i> form of marriage are closet bigots, so I&#x27;m not entirely sure what to take away from this. It seems to me that there&#x27;s far too much emotional investment to enjoy rational discourse. I can certainly understand <i>why</i> such emotions are raging uncontrollably, but as someone who is neither married nor really believes the state should have involvement in marriage (or at least, it should strictly be up to the state to be aware of certain long term relationships under contract law--not what those relationships are), it&#x27;s a bit beyond me as to why there&#x27;s so much disgust. I don&#x27;t feel so compelled to hate someone based on their beliefs, much less stop using a specific browser for reasons other than technical merits.<p>Side note: I admit that I had to do some digging around to figure out why OkCupid was urging users to stay away from Firefox since I visited the site with Chromium. I had completely forgotten about the tempest in a teapot that occurred when Eich was appointed to CEO. I can&#x27;t help but think this is something that&#x27;s intensely fascinating and of interest to a relatively small but vocal minority of people, although going by my small sample size of one is probably disingenuous. Still, there are more important issues IMO, and using/supporting an open and standards compliant browser (and open source) is of far greater importance to me than someone&#x27;s political stance who now happens to be CEO.<p>It&#x27;d be humorous to suggest a conspiracy at work here: Information about Eich&#x27;s donation was dug up and clandestinely released by someone paid for by Microsoft in effort to undermine Mozilla should he ever be appointed CEO!",1396317447
7505684,comment,7503881,7503881,1,0,peter_mcrae,,,"Awesome work! Will look at replacing some hand rolled stuff internally. One gap I see with a lot of A/B testing analysis is that it only solves for conversion. While conversion is a great metric for many tests, in my experience, revenue is often the metric that matters most. Whether it&#x27;s traditional eCommerce or selling tiered subscriptions, a lot of testing is geared towards 1) getting the customer to buy and 2) getting them into a more expensive product or plan. In the subscription scenario, some sort of customer life time value model is even better. I don&#x27;t pretend to know all the math, but the calcs I&#x27;ve seen focused on revenue (AOV * conversion) need order level data (as opposed to aggregate) so it&#x27;s not as easy to solve generically.",1396317441

7505672,comment,7503829,7504218,2,0,tim333,,,"Tax is a bit of a funny business and the laws vary from country to country and the enforcement of the law varies in random ways. For example if as a brit you buy some euros to spent on holiday and then the euro appreciates before you buy your tequila you&#x27;ve made a taxable gain. In practice no one declares that stuff and the revenue never investigates that stuff. At some point they start worrying - I&#x27;m not sure where. It depends on the mood. I recently had to account for the sale of a holiday home in euros and then converted into sterling and didn&#x27;t bother with the change in pound euro rate as it didn&#x27;t make much difference. Maybe £500 one way or the other. The UK revenue in practice don&#x27;t really make a fuss unless you are off by serval thousand although they don&#x27;t publish a fixed figure or else everyone would game their taxes to be off by just under that amount. So in practice with bitcoin if the gains are a few pounds people won&#x27;t bother. If they are say £30k you should probably declare it or risk pissing off the tax authorities. In the US I don&#x27;t know - they seem a bit more up tight about enforcing the letter of the law over petty amounts but you can only really tell by looking at what they do because if they published people would game the system.",1396317172

Given modern human rights, there&#x27;s no way to arrive at a no homo-marriage stance.<p>Your example statement isn&#x27;t useful either, as plenty of same-sex couples are unable to create children. By the same logic, infertile people should also be excluded. If that was the point (marriage only for people seeking to reproduce), at least it&#x27;d be consistent.<p>Excluding poly-amorous people from marriage is a mean, anti-human thing, too.<p>>So are you saying if a CEO of a company believed euthanasia to be wrong you&#x27;d stop using that companies products?<p>It&#x27;s more than just believing, it&#x27;d have to be that the CEO had performed actions to directly oppose euthanasia. And I generally don&#x27;t boycott something unless I think using the product will directly contribute to hurting something and there&#x27;s a reasonable alternative. For instance, buying a music CD directly gives money to a company that will lobby for DRM, against privacy, and for longer copyright. Whereas using FireFox is unlikely to directly help anti-gay campaigners.

I spent several months at UCLA&#x27;s Pediatric Intensive Outpatient Program with him and have seen it work on about a dozen children.  The same treatment can also be used on adults.<p>ERP stands for Exposure and Response Prevention.  The idea is that you progressively expose the person with OCD to their fear(s), during which, they cannot perform any compulsions.  Eventually the brain is retrained and the OCD falls away.  For example, someone with a fear of germs would be asked to touch a door handle and then not wash their hands for as long as possible.  This is extremely hard for them.  However, this simple technique, applied over weeks or months in conjunction with therapy and meds, can reduce a person&#x27;s OCD to almost nothing.<p>Another point is that the kids respond to the group setting.  They form bonds and support each other during the process.<p>The UCLA team is absolutely amazing at this: <a href=""http://www.semel.ucla.edu/adc/ocd_treatment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.semel.ucla.edu/adc/ocd_treatment</a><p>If you have or know a child suffering with the disorder, please look into this program or one like it!<p>If you have any questions for a parent that has been through this with a child, contact me at capitalism99@gmail.com",1396315338

As long as the people consent, why does the state need to approve?<p>Considering marriage is a non-binding contract (no fault divorce), the contract isn&#x27;t worth the paper it&#x27;s printed on (even prenups are overruled with alarming frequency).<p>From the state&#x27;s perspective, what does approving marriage offer? It offers monitoring and control (and a religious position), but almost nothing else. Child guardianship is already a non-marital issue. Last will and testaments along with living wills (if enforced properly) deal with most legal issues pertaining to marriage. Minor modifications to tax law deals with the rest.<p>If someone wants to be married, they should go to their local church, mosque, synagogue, or whatever. If they want legal protection, have a will and they should sign the proper docs (even married persons should do this). If they want a binding contract, they should contact a lawyer and get one (just as they would with a prenup if they want something semi-binding).",1396314374

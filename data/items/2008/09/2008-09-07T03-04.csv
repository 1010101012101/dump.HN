I never invested the effort to automate my backups even though I am well aware of cron.<p>Part of the problem is that the manual part of connecting the backup hard drive remains. I don't like online backups since I don't have sufficient bandwidth. So what I was really looking for was a nicely scripted backup solution that integrates with udev, so that I really only have to plug in my hard drive. And figuring out udev -- which tends to change from version to version -- is something that I thought I'd do ""later.""",1220759907

Just being able to know whether your cardio is improving linearly or logarithmically is huge, along with various muscle groups. It's very hard to identify your sticking points without being able to turn the data into graphs.",1220759415

This was <i>new</i> to them.<p>I'll put it more plainly--if you don't know if your market has money, and a real problem, there's a good chance you're wasting your time. They liked our service--just not not enough to justify the expenditure of money they didn't have.<p>Best of luck, and I hope it all works out.",1220758700

You run it by prepending ""valgrind"" to the command.  Then you read the output.  Valgrind is one of the most dummy-proof development tools I'm aware of.  For someone to claim that they don't have the patience to ""learn"" it is just beyond me.",1220758659

And, call me biased, but I think that that's always the reaction you get with truly top-notch products. It happens in all fields. It's the reaction you get with Samuel Beckett, or The Big Lebowski, or Portal. It's never ""awful versus wonderful,"" it's ""wonderful versus overrated.""",1220758413

297218,comment,297181,297205,0,0,ericb,,,"I made a website for real estate brokers to manage their apartment listings.  One of my partners was a sales guy.  We made very little sales headway as the problem wasn't pressing enough to brokers--getting available apartments by fax and keeping them in 3-ring binders was a ""good enough"" solution for them, and in terms of paying a monthly fee, they just didn't have the money to spend on something they saw as a luxury.  Services can be great businesses, but creating them for their own sake is a recipe for failure.  My real estate agent co-founder was <i>sure</i> this service should exist. He was just wrong about the extent of brokers' willingness to pay for a better mousetrap.",1220757894

I think he's right-- most startups (most companies, really) are woefully bad at communicating in a way that their customers understand.

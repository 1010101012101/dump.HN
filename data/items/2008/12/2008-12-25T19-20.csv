409725,comment,409567,409644,0,0,gjm11,,,"Yup, they're all numerical algorithms (er, at least almost all; I haven't checked anything like every single one). They started out in the ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software. The amount of information you get along with the code is variable, but often small. The code is all too frequently in FORTRAN, too, especially (of course) in the older algorithms. But there's some very good stuff in there.",1230234483
409724,comment,408786,409124,0,0,trevelyan,,,"It is a fair comparison tptacek. For years the canonical sentiment about Hong Kong in Britain (where it is relatively easy to get permission to work on the island) has been that it is an economic backwater suitable only for those who cannot make it back home. There was even a derogatory acronym in common parlance to describe the people who went to work there: F.I.L.T.H. (Failed in London, Tried Hong Kong).<p>Asserting that Hong Kong is a city on par with New York or London is going against years of perception to the opposite, mostly driven by the higher wages for the financial class in Western financial centers. That said, unless someone speaks mandarin these days, they are not likely to find the sorts of opportunities that previously existed in Hong Kong. One of the great things about the island is that it's always been a working city, and it is reorienting to mainland markets quickly.",1230234303

If not, please explain.",1230234301
409722,comment,408858,409099,0,0,wmf,,,"This is not some small licensing detail; it's their entire revenue stream. Cilk++ is basically a compiler. Normally the compiler license doesn't affect your software that is compiled with the compiler, but if Cilk Arts allowed people to compile proprietary code with the free version of their compiler, there'd be no reason to pay them at all.<p>BTW, I think ICC has a similar provision.",1230234259

409714,comment,408786,409575,0,0,Tichy,,,"I think allocating money properly would be creating value. Deciding were to invest could be one of the most important decisions possible. That many finance types might have been involved in something else is another matter.<p>Even if you want to manufacture stuff, you have to somehow organize the manufacturing. To say only manufacturing is worthwhile seems a bit shortsighted. Suppose all the finance guys would go to GM and work in their factories assembling cars, would it help much?",1230233572
409713,comment,408767,408772,0,0,Tangurena,,,"Well, MCP just means you've passed one or more certification exams. My current employer is a gold partner with MS, and as a result, we need to have 2+ people with ""higher"" certifications, such as MCSD, MCAD or MCPD. It saves our company about $50k/year in software licensing. And even though our company hands out a $500 bonus per test passed (plus reimbursement of test and prep materials, and another $1k-1500 for each certification level achieved), only 2 of us at the office are ""bothering"" to keep updating our certifications/credentials. The other guys say they're ""interested"" but I think they're holding out for more money.",1230233554

409708,comment,409537,409537,0,0,pg,,,"I'd bet not, actually.  The lost decade in Japan was due to unique structural problems in the Japanese economy.  The current recession is just a classic speculative bubble.  A bad one, certainly, but not qualitatively different from the speculative bubbles the west has been bouncing back from since the 17th century.",1230233014

Put the data out there, where independent and competitive interests can mine it.  I'm not informed enough (nor, perhaps, wise enough) to propose the details of such an approach, but it seems to me a good area for increased competition.  This would include lowering/removing the barriers to general, public participation.  There will be fruitcakes, but also, I suspect, significant cooperative efforts.<p>To over-simplify into a slogan:  If Visa can analyse my every purchase, I don't see why I shouldn't be able and enabled to do the same of them.",1230232740

409701,comment,409584,409584,0,0,villageidiot,,,"How do you know if your conditon is rare enough to be included without going to the site and checking their index of communities?<p>When the site first opened I requested them to include a separate community for RSI/carpal tunnel syndrome although it is not exactly rare since it affects about 10% of the US population. Although I never received a response I now see a general ""Nerve Entrapment"" community which includes other disorders similar to RSI. That community has a single member. Instead, had they allowed this, I might have pointed people there from other RSI forums on the web.<p>I thought the idea behind rareshare had the potential for much greater growth than they have seen - with only 2000 monthly uniques currently. And I think making editorial decisions about which groups should exist and which ones should not indicates that the spirit in which the site was created is more of a throwback to old media rather than enacting the web 2.0 idea about the individual taking control of the medium.",1230232261

This tilts your pelvis a tiny bit that adds up over time, and can lead to lower back pain.<p>Another thing that is helping is that our employer signed us all up for virgin health miles.

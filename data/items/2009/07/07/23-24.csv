Once the software is ""released,"" the maintenance team steps in and the R&D team moves on. Google doesn't do this, so there's no meaning to a Google product being ""in beta"" or ""out of beta.""",1247011022

692888,comment,691569,691569,0,0,10ren,,,"I don't see this as a criticism of the HN comments at all, but as just an excuse to restate that a business (or even just a product) is much more than code.<p>That said, there can be some competitive advantage due to code, and businesses and products vary in how important the code is. eg Google's pagerank was important (perhaps all important algorithms are only valuable if they are patented... because otherwise they just aren't that hard to copy). For a web2.0 site like SO, I think the code itself is fairly minor, and even the user experience (UI layout, interactions and features), though much more work, is also not that hard to copy. But to copy the business is hard.<p>The most important competitive advantages for SO are network effects (and potential for further growth); and that people are continuously working on it to improve it.<p><i>EDIT</i> this makes me realize why an academic at uni doubted how much of google's success was due to the algorithm - I now think he was reacting to people in that environment who tend to give too much emphasis to code and to algorithms. In my view, it's clear that a better way of doing things (such as a new algorithm) can be the basis of a product or business. Of course it can. But it's not enough on its own.",1247010393

Forming a fund is prohibitively expensive (legal fees), never mind actually convincing someone to give you their money.  There's some protections that are afforded by that supply imbalance.

Small companies such as Heatlh Data Insights have been started here and grew exceedingly quickly.  Moreover even its nature as a resort town is helpful to certain types of startups since numerous conventions are held here and thus facilitate networking with people in various fields with minimal travel.<p>It currently has both a major university (UNLV) and a smaller community college (CSN).  While neither are exceptionally highly ranked that is largely because they are young as institutions and UNLV was improving with impressive speed prior to the economic downturn.  Boyd School of Law within UNLV continues to climb the charts in spite of the downturn.  So there is a strong and growing academic base here.<p>While the cost of living here is unfortunately high, it is less so than Silicon Valley so that is clearly no major barrier.<p>In all, I think Las Vegas would be a rich vein for startups in the future.",1247010326

We haven't agreed on what we mean by ""intervention"".<p>When I say that the U.S. should stop intervening in other people's business, I mean that the U.S. should stop planting brutal dictatorships around the world. These may satisfy Washington's interests in the short term, but they're a disaster in the long term. In the 1950s a left-wing government was elected in Iran, and the CIA and the MI6 orchestrated a coupe to depose the democratically elected government and plant a dictatorship. Same happened in Chile in the 1970s. Sure, back then there was a threat of the having the Cold War turning very, very hot indeed, and sometimes pawns have to be sacrificed. But people don't easily forget. This sort of Uncle Sam's ""baby-sitting"" prevents the people from doing mistakes on their own, and gives them a common enemy, the U.S.. Let them fail on their own. Especially so if their government was democratically elected.<p>There are smarter ways of fighting for resources. I think the 1991 Gulf War was a prime example.

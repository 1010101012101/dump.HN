2436094,comment,2435129,2435826,7,0,rdtsc,,,"It is kind of interesting that unlike many of the ""exotic"" languages in the list Erlang has arrived where it is from another direction -- from practical necessities of telecom platforms. But interestingly it has arrived at similar results as many academic functional languages. So for example, all base data structures are immutable and variables are single assignment only. Now someone coming from C(++) or Java will hate that, but that is needed in order to provide stability and a consistent view into the data structures in a concurrent environment. So ""fixing"" it and making data structures mutable would break that.<p>Then I like how you said 'statephobia'. In case of Erlang they saw the practical difficulty with having one single mutable state across a large distributed system so applied the 'actor-based concurrency model'. Perhaps other, more academic languages, decided to cure their statephobia because of some aesthetic desire, maybe they wanted the functions to look more like math functions, but they both declared war on spreading mutable state, even though they started from different ends of the spectrum.",1302587958

Identifying or presenting as a nerd communicates that the signaler considers themself a part of that culture or community.<p>Finding communities amongst each domain can be difficult.

Many people argue that the future of programming will involve dumbing things down as more and more people become programmers, and one way of dumbing things down is to use natural language.  (I shudder at involuntary thoughts of COBOL.)  Instead of dumbing languages down, I think it would be much more beneficial to raise the intelligence of the programmers.  I hope that the future of programming languages tends toward mathematics, not human language.<p>Currently, I am often very happy with Haskell syntax for solving problems, when it is possible to define an implementation that is precise, concise, and easy to understand.  For solving problems that do not easily map to Haskell syntax, using DSLs (Domain Specific Languages) to map from a representation designed for the problem in question to a Haskell representation still allows Haskell to be a good choice of language.",1302587436

Now, it seems to me that the estimate has to be a good-faith estimate in order for the negotiation to be valid.</i><p>That's where you have gone wrong. No private company (unless they are insane) will ever state a future value for a stock package - they will merely offer units of stock (and maybe state it in terms of a percentage of the company). The employee might try and calculate that value, and the company might state things like ""based on our last funding valuation these shares are valued at $X"", but that is very different to claiming they will be worth anything at any date in the future.<p>In startup companies, share options are usually granted using a vesting arrangement, which assigns a low value to the share options but doesn't allow \nthe employee to buy them until some point in the future (where presumably the share will be worth more than the option). If that point arrives, and the shares are worth less than the options then bad luck! (This situation isn't uncommon, and is known as ""being underwater"". It occurs in public companies, too. For example, Google revalued the options of its employees in 2008 after the Google share price fell substantially and a majority of its employees were underwater)<p>The situation is different for publicly listed companies of course, because there the stock actually <i>is</i> worth something. In that case the company really can give a value to the shares at that point in time.",1302585516

The initial byte at location X will eventually be ""recycled"" and initialized.<p>Since Flash does append only writing under the hood anyways, it is a better idea to do append only explicitly so that you get the advantages of append only (e.g., the ability to revert to older versions).",1302585367

2500718,comment,2500082,2500232,3,0,glenra,,,"> <i>What does it cost to let everyone ride the same bus and have them eat in the same place?</i><p>It's not clear <i>why</i> this contract agency runs on a different schedule than the rest of the company - 4am to 2:30 or whatever - maybe it's just traffic flow, or maybe they work a lot with a group in a different timezone. But  the fact that they <i>do</i> run on a different schedule implies it could cost quite a lot to ""let everyone ride the same bus and have them eat in the same place"". People arriving at work at 4am would need to arrive on <i>different buses</i> than those arriving at 8 - you'd have to hire extra buses just for them, find drivers willing to <i>start</i> driving well before 3am, and hope there's enough concentration that this one building of people rates its own bus stop locations - if they're spread out all over they'd be better served by carpooling. (Not to mention that the reason for Google buses is so employees can get work done during what might otherwise be a long, aggravating rush-hour commute, whereas the commute at 3am/2:15pm is easy and fast)<p>Similarly, people who arrive at 4am are on a different lunch schedule than the rest of the company so you'd have to operate the cafeteria longer, pay overtime, hire more workers, etc.<p>That's a lot to do for people who don't even work for Google directly.<p>UPDATE: Another poster wrote that this group is working in multiple shifts, presumably to get through more books faster with the available facilities. That makes perfect sense - this is the morning shift, then the evening shift arrives, maybe a swing shift after that. Which would make running the kitchens and the buses long enough for everybody <i>really</i> expensive.",1304174898

You were hired by Transvideo Studios who filled a contractor slot on their video production contract with Google.<p><i>""I had access to a personally unprecedented amount of privileges, but was not entitled to the ski trips, DisneyLand adventures, stock options, and holiday cash bonuses""</i><p>That's because you weren't a Google employee. You were a Transvideo Studios employee. Do you expect to receive benefits from another company just because you happen to be walking around on their campus?<p><i>""The workers wearing yellow badges are not allowed any of the privileges that I was allowed  ride the Google bikes, take the Google luxury limo shuttles home, eat free gourmet Google meals, attend Authors@Google talks and receive free, signed copies of the authors books, or set foot anywhere else on campus except for the building they work in.""</i><p>So hourly employees aren't entitled to the benefits package of salaried exempt employees? And the way Google is setup is to pool employee benefits in and around their building, ergo the only way for hourly employees to not receive the benefits package is to work in a different facility?! Stop the presses! It's a conspiracy!<p>I almost stopped reading there, hand stuck to my forehead, but then I saw this as I was closing the page and was hooked to the rest of this like watching a train wreck happen.<p><i>""To Whom It May Concern,<p>Yesterday I was outside the Google Book Search building, which is adjacent to the building I work in, and had the chance to talk to a few employees while they were leaving work. Most of them are people of color and are supposedly involved in the labor of digitizing information. Im interested in issues of class, race, and labor, and so out of general curiosity I wanted to ask these workers about their jobs. I am aware of internal mechanisms for discussing labor issues with Google, and had no intention of defaming the company. I was not aware of how secretive the Book Search project is, but now understand how seriously my curiosity could jeopardize not only my own job and Transvideos relationship with Google, but also my legal situation because of the non-disclosure agreement I signed.<p>I apologize for bothering you with this innocent mistake and can assure you that in the future I will be more cautious about respecting confidentiality at Google.<p>Sincerely,<p>Andrew Wilson""</i><p>You're also a liar. Your intention was not to explore your passing interest in labor, class or race, but to feed your own self-importance by uncovering a made-up conspiracy of class warfare at Google, where the man is oppressing a silent minority of underclass poor people from enjoying the rights and privileges of the ruling overclasses. Did you mention that you were secretly video taping this?<p>You wanted to document this in as dishonest a way as possible, ""exposing"" this ""dark secret"" to the world the way PETA exposes animal cruelty in meat processing plants, with hidden cameras, a blog post loaded with terms-and-phrases-of-controversy.<p><i>""But Marco called back in a frenzy, saying that Google security had proof of me outside, filming yellow-badged workers leaving the 3.1459~ building on two separate occasions. I told him this was true and he said that Google legal was now involved, and they needed the video tapes immediately.""</i><p>So of course your immediate innocent reaction, which you didn't think was important to share with anybody, was to secretly videotape people coming and going from their place of work without their permission.<p><i>""Burt then presented me with a document that would terminate my employment on the basis of me using __Googles video equipment__ during working hours __(although it was during my lunchbreak)__""</i><p>It's still Google's equipment you nitwit.<p><i>""I told him I could take the shuttle home, as Ive gotten on without my badge numerous times, but he insisted on driving me to the CalTrain station.""</i><p>Really? You don't understand why they wanted to escort you personally off campus? After you were abusing company equipment, violating security, secretly filming your coworkers and pretending not to find the film, then documenting your lie by putting the video you couldn't find up on your site, then lying to your managers about the entire thing? What are you 8? It boggles the mind.<p>I wonder how many of the yellow badges got fired as a result of this asshole?<p>Wake me when this guy grows up and starts seeing a psychiatrist.

Thanks for reminding me of it.<p>Reading this reminded me of something that I've thought of a number of times but don't have fully worked out. (I.e., bear with me for a minute if I ramble.) We need a better way to describe the parts of (many) skills that lie between 'thought' and 'muscle memory'. (Maybe some researchers already have better ways?) The only sport that I was ever expert at was pool. For many years in my 20s, I played at least twice a day for anywhere from 1 hour to 3 hours each time. (I was in grad school. First stretch was post lunch, usually shorter. Second stretch was out at bars post evening work. How long depended on how many people I beat.) Eventually I reached the point where I would shoot, pick up the chalk, rechalk the cue slightly and <i>already</i> be walking to my next shot. I didn't really think about all this and it wasn't exactly muscle memory (as the grip, stance or swing is muscle memory). But I knew where the cue ball would end up, and I knew what my next shot (and ideally, two, three or more forward) needed to be and I would move towards that spot intuitively.<p>Wayne Gretzky has the famous quotation: ""A good hockey player plays where the puck is. A great hockey player plays where the puck is going to be."" That's the thing I wish I could describe better. It's <i>not</i> pure thought (it's barely conscious thought at all, usually), but it's also not physical training only. It's both - combined with a very clear mental picture of the domain you're dealing with. (Cf. what people always say about Larry Bird ""seeing the whole court"" at all times.)",1304172125

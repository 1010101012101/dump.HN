It always surprises me when someone insists that technology start ups can only exist in a small part of California or Massachusetts where they're competing directly for every kind of resource (people, space, etc.) with the richest companies in the world.  There are huge universities all over the midwest that produce tens of thousands of engineering and computer science grads every year.  In my opinion, any one of the Big Ten college towns would be a great place to build a company to last.  Plenty of grads would stay close to family in the midwest if they could and it's easy to find cheap space to work.  You'd miss certain parts of the startup infrastructure like specialized lawyers and ridiculous numbers of venture capitalists, but you'd also cut down on distractions from the hype machine.",1353524250

4815699,comment,4814249,4815261,8,0,danso,,,"I think we're not going to agree on what constitutes a change in principles by the time this thread leaves the homepage, so I've tried to narrow the scenario, which I guess leaves it open to being seen as a strawman.<p>But consider the gist of MLK's situation:<p>1) His primary goal was to create equality among whites and minorities. I'll agree that he never wavered from that. In the same way, every major figure on either side of the abortion debate, at every point in the continuum, will argue that they've never wavered for their respect for human life. The problem is getting to that big goal, and that path almost always requires wavering.<p>2) In support of my point, the idea of desegregation was so big that organizing a campaign against it devolved into a messy unorganized effort (current-day example: Occupy Wall street). When he tried to campaign against ending desegregation in Albany, he had very little success. He underestimated the widespread opposition to such a sea change.<p>3) In Birmingham, he changed his strategy to attack obvious injustices that moderately conservative whites could back. Yes, changing the bus-seating policy is a form of desegregation, but it was possible to change that policy and still have Jim Crow laws still be the law of the land.<p>So if you were an observer of the civil rights movement at that time, yet outside of King's inner circle, what could you possibly conclude except that from Albany to Birmingham, MLK has moderated his stance against desegregation? Certainly, as the audience that MLK wanted to reach -- the white status quo -- you could get on board with treating blacks more decently, as long as they didn't go to the same schools your kids do.<p>It's only after the successes of these limited campaigns that King himself could be seen as a successful leader of the movement. His strategy to fight small battles as to be more palatable to segregation-supporting whites was critical...and it was <i>politics</i>. Politics is about compromise and choosing battles wisely. The problem with your argument is that you don't see that one man's ""choosing battles and running away to fight another day"" is another man's ""spineless flip-flopping appeasement"", which MLK certainly was accused of being. It's only through the passage of time, when all those events are compressed into a convenient explanatory narrative, that you can think of it as MLK Jr. being a constant, unwavering political force.",1353524109

4815690,comment,4815212,4815369,7,0,BobbyH,,,"I also grew up in Northern Virginia. I now live in NYC.<p>I hadn't considered the broader effects of this sort of migration, until I recently read ""The Big Sort"", a brilliant book written in 2009 that describes how like-minded people are ""sorting"" themselves through migration. One way to quantify this effect is to look at the number of ""landslide counties"", i.e. the number of counties in the US that preferred a presidential candidate by more than 20%.<p>You can see a map showing how these landslide counties have sharply increased here (the top map is from 1976, and the bottom map is from 2004): <a href=""http://www.thebigsort.com/maps.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thebigsort.com/maps.php</a><p>What's happening is that voters are moving with their feet to be with more like-minded people. This skews many counties towards a particular direction (either Republican or Democrat). Further, as counties tip one way, the minority viewpoint gets suppressed in just the way you described (e.g. if you're a Democrat, why bother voting for Governor in Texas).<p>One thing that surprised me in the book is that not every state is homogenous. The author lives in Austin, so he spends a lot of time talking about how all the liberals move to Austin (and conservatives move out). So even in the bastion of Republican Texas, there is a liberal enclave.<p>Looking at Des Moines, it seems that Des Moines is a similar liberal enclave. For instance, in 2008, Des Moines, Iowa voted for Obama over McCain with a 23% margin: <a href=""http://www.city-data.com/elec08/DES-MOINES-IOWA.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.city-data.com/elec08/DES-MOINES-IOWA.html</a><p>So it seems like there are a fair number of liberal enclaves in conservative states. To give another example,""The urban core of Kansas City consistently votes Democratic in Presidential elections"": <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri#National_political_conventions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri#National_...</a><p>So even if it's true that ""Silicon X'es can only happen in liberal pro-intellectual areas"", there seem to be enough liberal enclaves in conservative states that Silicon X'es could possibly arise.",1353524018

4815667,comment,4814249,4814899,2,0,spodek,,,"Not necessarily.<p>Patents and patent trolls affect different-sized companies differently and can be competitive advantages for large and incumbent companies as barriers to entry for new companies. Bill Gates knew his competition would come from two guys in a garage (or graduate school) more than another big company, so his company would be enthusiastic about such barriers.<p><i>Here's how the barrier works against potential new entrants.</i><p>Large companies with large patent portfolios mutually license portfolios in exchange for not suing each other, giving them competitive advantages over small and new companies. A new company with one legally defensible patent can't use it to compete with Microsoft, who will claim the new company is infringing on several of Microsoft's thousands, or the mutually licensed ones with other companies. Any non-trivial code can reasonably be claimed to infringe on some patents. Even if it isn't, no small or new company will beat Microsoft.<p><i>What about trolls who don't intend to bring a product to market and just want money?</i><p>Large companies with large legal departments can defeat most patent trolls with experience and having large budgets. Paying all the lawyers may cost them money and they'll lose some, but money and experience will win most of the time. The point is it creates another barrier to entry to small companies with fewer resources to fight back. They either have to give up or pay the troll, losing profitability and ability to compete.<p>So patent trolls still create a competitive advantage for Microsoft. Microsoft's legal costs may decrease its margins, but they remain better entrenched, improving stability and profitability overall.<p><i>Why wouldn't Google like patent trolls?</i><p>Google's profitability doesn't depend on selling software nearly as much as Microsoft. It profits from advertising. Software patents give them advantages over small and new companies, but not as much as for Microsoft. Take away software patents (how else to get rid of trolls?) and Microsoft will be reverse engineered away. Google will continue.",1353523859

A contract is very similar to a piece of code. The main difference is that it is to be executed by humans instead of machines and enforced by a legal system instead of a machine's design.<p>Contracts have been deemed non patentable and a high bar has been set for copyrightability compared to other text because of the requirement that contract language be well defined with particular sentences having an agreed upon interpretation based on court precedents.<p>This means lawyers writing contracts don't have to worry, for each sentence that they write, that it may be infringing on someone else having written a similar one. They also don't have to worry that a combination of clauses have been patented and they can't use it in their contract.<p>Programmers on the other hand worry about it for every new piece of code they write. The bar is so low for patentability and copyrightability that we pretty much know someone somewhere has patented a large part of the code we write. We just hope nobody with the patent is interested in going after us because we aren't worth the trouble. But there is always that feeling that if ever we become commercially successful, the trolls and wolves will be waiting to try to get a slice of our profits.

A few days ago, I found myself explaining to someone why custom hardware and GPUs could so easily outperform processors, and I realized that most programmers have no concept of how much overhead the general nature of a processor entails. (Although, I don't think most programmers really <i>need</i> to know this.)<p>For instance, let's take the problem of multiplying ten numbers. In a normal processor, you have a loop of instructions, each instruction has to go through a ""fetch"" state (to load it from memory), a ""decode"" stage, to figure out what the instruction is, an ""issue"" stage, to figure out which processor pipeline can best execute this instruction, an ""execute"" stage, to finally execute the instruction, and maybe a ""commit"" stage to write the outputs back to memory. (The exact number of stages and amount of parallelism depends on the microarchitecture and pipeline depth, of course). What if we wanted to just build a chip that did this? We could put ten multipliers on the chip, and then do the exact same operations in just a few clock cycles, since we would have no instruction fetch or decode, no commit, no loops, and so on. This is a contrived example, but my point is that general-purpose processors are incredibly slow compared to dedicated hardware, precisely because the extra transistors necessary to make processors general purpose also take a large portion of the computing time.<p>I find the idea of FPGAs reconfigured per-application to be really interesting.

Instead, he should realize that his goal is pretty much impossible to accomplish in the current political climate. Because it is impossible, he should seek to achieve the smaller goal of successfully reforming patent law, because a small win is better than a big loss. It doesn't mean that you have given up, it just means that you realize that you aren't going to win the war in a single day.<p>I think the point that they were trying to make was that accepting reality and compromising ones beliefs are two different things.

Anyone interested contact me off-list for far more details and an unfinished paper with some of my research.<p>A couple of years ago my son and I were watching a documentary on the subject of concrete.  It was very interesting.  They covered a wide range of topics but one of them really started to trigger my curiosity: The Panama Canal.<p>I don't know why, but I became very interested in the financial metrics surrounding the canal.  How much does it cost to cross it?  How long does it take?  How many ships cross it per year?  Where do they come from?  Where do they go?<p>The more I learned the more the reality of the Canal horrified me.  Why?<p>The bulk of the commercial traffic through the Canal are container ships.  And these ships burn something very nasty: Bunker Fuel.  This is, by almost any measure, the dirtiest fuel you could burn.  it's horrible stuff.<p>When I started to do the math I started to realize the magnitude of the problem.  These ships move at about 20 miles per hour.  They could go faster but there's a balance between the high cost of hydrodynamic drag and fuel costs.  A trip from Shanghai to Long Beach takes about 18 days and will burn somewhere in the range of 3,600 to 7,200 metric tons of fuel.  For those not comfortable visualizing units in the metric system, that's from 7,936,560 to 15,873,120 pounds. Yes, fifteen million pounds of the nastiest crap you could burn is used to bring your iPhones (conjecture) and other stuff from Shanghai to Long Beach.<p>If my research is correct, the fleet of about 100,000 cargo ships (Yes, 100,000!!!) burns over a million metric tons of bunker fuel PER DAY.<p>400 million metric tons of bunker fuel per year, which is equivalent to 120 billion gallons.<p>Can't relate to that number?<p>Here's an interesting comparison:<p>To get a better sense of how large this number is we can try to relate it to how many cars one could fill-up with fuel and for how long. 120 billion gallons would provide enough fuel to supply 100,000 cars (assuming a 20 gallon tank) with a full tank of gas every week...for over 1,000 years.<p><pre><code>  100,000 cars.\n  20 gallons per week.\n  For a THOUSAND years.\n</code></pre>\nAnd our fleet of container ships use this in ONE YEAR.<p>The evil, when it comes to pollution and energy dependence, isn't the much-abused light bulb; it's the elephant in the room: Ocean-going cargo ships.<p>While our mass media chooses to focus its attention on an oil spill (because it is sensational and it serves political purposes), what is really killing our planet slowly is the transportation of iPhones, Blackberries, TV's, blenders, washers, cars, widgets and gadgets on inefficient and highly-polluting ocean-going vessels. Even the latest Gulf spill is insignificant in terms of environmental impact when compared to what 100,000 ships are doing to our environment each and every year.<p>It is estimated that the fleet of nearly 100,000 cargo ships in the world produces over 20 million tons of Sulfur Oxides (SOx) per year.  For comparison, the entire fleet of automobiles in the world (about 800 million cars) produces about 80,000 tons of the same contaminant.<p>How about the Canal?<p>A container ship traveling from Los Angeles to NYC through the Canal will burn about 4,500 metric tons of buker-C fuel.  This amount of fuel costs approximately US $1.8 million.  Canal fees would run somewhere around $300K.  The trip from L.A. to NYC through the Canal runs well over two million dollars, without including handling, insurance, crew costs, amortization, maintenance, etc.  That's quite a chunk of change, however, when divided by the thousands of containers a ship can move it becomes a few hundred dollars per container.<p>How many ships go through the Canal per year?<p>Approximately 15,000.<p>I'll leave you to do the math.  I have far more detail in my notes.  What these ships are doing to our environment is simply horrific.  The pollution doesn't stop at the act of burning fuel.<p>Cargo ships are also the source of an unusual form of pollution.  Ships use huge ballast tanks to stabilize themselves.  These ballast tanks are filled and emptied of sea water during loading and unloading operations at port.  It is through this mechanism that cargo ships are responsible for transporting harmful organisms across the world into ecosystems that cannot handle them.  The introduction of non-native species into a new ecosystem can have devastating consequences.<p>And so, from watching a simple documentary I came to the realization that, for some strange reason, we have been ignoring the most significant source of environmental pollution on our planet.  And, beyond that, one of the largest --if not the largest-- consumer of petroleum products.<p>I didn't stop at just identifying the problem.  I also wanted to take a stab at a solution.  I came up with something I called ""The American High Speed Cargo System"" (AHSCS) as a loose proposal.  This would be a cargo-only, electric powered, high speed rail system.  It would connect --at the very least-- both coasts and, ideally, other major US ports.  The idea would be to move cargo over land from port to port at 200 miles per hour.  High speed passenger trains in the US are a waste of money and that's particularly true in California (don't get me started there).  Not so for high-speed cargo.<p>The numbers are there to support it:  A cargo ship spends over two million dollars to get from L.A. to NYC.  Probably closer to three.  Those same containers could be moved far more efficiently over land, at similar or lower costs and pollute far, far less.  You are exchanging aerodynamic drag for hydrodynamic drag.  Huge difference.<p>In terms of energy costs (just the electricity), I came up with numbers in the order of $10K for a trip from L.A. to NYC.  I further estimated that the system would require around 700MW of power, let's call it 1,000MW.  We have 53 nuclear plants that can source 1GW each.  This is a case where nuclear power might be a really good option.<p>However, the scope of the project needs to be realized.  Developing and building such a systems has the potential to generate hundreds of thousands of jobs, if not millions.  It should be revenue neutral if not positive (sorry Panama).  It would allow for the installation of upgraded communications and power backbones that would be synergistic to the process of building the rail system.  It would also allow for the potential to install huge solar and wind-power farms to fully or partially power the system.<p>I have not explored every angle but would like to think that, if my numbers and assumptions are right, this could be the most important project this nation could embark on.  You have to think in terms of a hundred or two-hundred year scale.  These ships are not going to go away unless something very significant changes.  Of course, the same concept ought to be replicated across the planet.  Again, if I am right, we should strive to eliminate most, if not all, container ships traversing our oceans.  We are making an absolute mess out of our planet.<p><a href=""http://news.discovery.com/tech/shipping-network-map.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.discovery.com/tech/shipping-network-map.html</a><p>Like I said, there's more.  If interested email me off list and I can send you a copy of my notes so far.  It'd be interesting to have someone go over my notes and verify my assumptions and calculations.  I tried to raise the issue with politicians but, what can I say, I only have so much time to deal with morons.<p>NOTE:<p>I thank you for your comments.  I have to ask that you do me a favor.  Please refrain from making categorical statements about the relative efficiency of ships vs. a proposed high-speed electric train without having done the math yourself.  Please drop me an email and I'll be more than happy to provide you with a copy of my calcs, an unfinished paper as well as links, PDF's and references.  Then we can talk about the merits of the concept.  I am actually very interested in having the concept, calculations and assumptions criticized.

I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something"" -- Richard Feynman<p>A name serves to remind you what the variable represents, and serves to represent the variable in expressions.<p>Reminding you of what it represents generally works best with long names--with the major exception that names that follow domain conventions are often better than longer names that do not.<p>Representing the variable in expressions, on the other hand, often improves with shorter names because longer names make it harder to see the relationships in the expression.<p>It would be a big improvement, in my opinion, if variable names did not have to be so linear in most languages. I want subscripts and superscripts. That allows effectively longer names without taking up too much extra space and making it harder to see the relationships in an expression.",1353521195

They drive out their smart people, who don't want to hide their intelligence on a daily basis.  They have to leave: every time you hear a nonsensical but popular argument, it hurts not to say something.  You can only do that for so long.  Now some choose to stay, mostly by learning to suppress (or avoid learning/thinking about) intellect in many areas, and then focusing all that in a small area.  That way, they can fit in with everyone else at 90%, and fit in other people's ontologies as |normal +x|.  Of course, that means living a mostly-lobotamized life.<p>My concern with Silicon X-type articles are when they're happening in areas that may be anti-intellectual.

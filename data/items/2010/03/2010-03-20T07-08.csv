Immediate, effective encryption for cloud computing, regardless of the platform?  Sign me up.<p>The article he's basing the work on <i>is</i> rather simple, though I haven't given it a hard deconstruction.  An encryption / decryption algorithm research article that also includes derivation and proofs, in 25 pages?  That's downright <i>easy</i> compared to many I've seen.",1269071635

In 2008 she married and added her husband's last name.<p>Her full legal name (in first-middle-middle-middle-last-last-last-last form) no longer fits into any database known to man, nor even on her driver's license, and is a consistent source of amusement.",1269071457

The balance is tilted against the existence of an activist jury in any but the cases of the wealthy and famous. Those might manage to jolt some life into an otherwise orderly farce. Not that these jolts are positive, just unusually vigorous. Democracy is participation, Orwell might as well have retorted, some get to participate more than others.",1269071318

  16 Now I say unto you, that because all men are not just it is not expedient that ye should have a king or kings to rule over you.

Prior to this, something 30 micrometers was usually considered <i>unbelievably</i> massive to apply quantum principles to.<p>Dare I say I smell quantum-mechanic <i>mechanical</i> experiments soon?  How about gears that rotate and don't?  I also wonder if this could be the basis for a relatively easy way to make a quantum computer.<p>edit: another article [1] and the data's original article [2] (behind a paywall).  By the article's abstract, it sounds like they measure the state of the drum with a quantum bit ""coupled"" to its state.

1206135,comment,1205423,1205888,0,0,verisimilitude,,,"While I can't disagree with your idea of aesthetics, I would argue that Apple's entire product line is not about an aesthetic sense as much as a design imperative.  In promotional interviews for products (iPad, recent iMacs) you'll find Ives repeatedly mentioning how many unnecessary elements he and his team have _removed_ from products.  This seems to be the ideal from which their industrial design team works.  Cf. Steve Jobs quote:<p>“Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think it’s this veneer — that the designers are handed this box and told, ‘Make it look good!’ That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.”<p>That quote was curated by Gruber: <a href=""http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/03/20/design-is-how-it-works"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/03/20/design-is-how-it...</a>",1269069409

1206127,comment,1205423,1205960,0,0,andreyf,,,"<i>Why does the cellphone market need to be so much different?</i><p>Because Microsoft is making money selling software and commoditizing hardware, while Google sees both software <i>and</i> hardware as a compliment to their business (and so, gives software away for free (hardware is commoditized enough)). By comparison, Apple is trying to make profit off markup in precisely those areas: hardware + software.<p>In short, the numbers are very different. While laptops are now split nicely at $1000 (<1000 - mostly PC's, >1000 - mostly Macs), what we're talking about is devices Apple wants to sell for $700 soon costing less than half of that for similar ""Android"" manufacturers. I forget the marketing-speak explaining this, but that gap is a big problem.<p>In summary, Google wants a world where both hardware and software are a commodity. For Apple, this is bad, bad, <i>bad</i>, as that's precisely the market they're trying to make their markup.",1269068597

Macs aren't a majority, but they're up there, and depending on your site's demographic, making sure stuff looks right/works on the Mac can be very important.  I run OS X/Safari, OS X/Firefox, WinXP/IE6, WinXP/IE7, WinXP/Firefox, Vista/IE7, Vista/Firefox, etc... on my Mac very easily.  I can also run my Windows VM at whatever screen size/resolution I want to see how things will look on a 1024/768 display, without hosing my main display/work area.<p>For whatever reason, using Photoshop on a Mac is easier/better looking for me.  I can't back that up, but it's a strong difference for me.<p>Apple displays generally have better color gamut, than the displays from major PC vendors.

For example, Google Reader. In the user agent string, Google Reader (as well as, I believe, Netvibes, Newsgator, and a few others) says ""X subscribers"", and that number is then used by FeedBurner. You can check this out yourself if you have access to web stats on a domain that hosts feeds. Check them out. You get to see the same numbers that FeedBurner puts on their charts.<p>With non-Web / non-centralized readers, it gets trickier, but FeedBurner uses IP addresses combined with user agent strings to get an idea of what's a unique reader requesting multiple times or not.

919394,comment,916848,918438,0,0,lamnk,,,"<i>What do you consider cheap for bandwidth?</i><p>Depend on servers usage. $399 per month for a 100mpbs line is not expensive if you have for example a streaming server. But my sites consum about 1TB a month in total, so why pay for more when my need is only 5Mpbs ? (10Mbps gives you 3TB up and 3TB down if it's full duplex)<p>As technology advances bandwidth price will definitely go down. My point is that as of now bandwidth cost still represents a significant share of a server's total cost. 100Mpbs becomes cheap when you have a bunch of servers, like 15+. That's why low end dedicated servers and VPSs still have a market, hosting companies can buy wholesale bandwidth/hardware for cheap and then resell, though the margin is not that good.",1257260369

919392,comment,919211,919211,0,0,jbellis,,,"My comment from the blog (currently ""awaiting moderation"") --<p>The core misunderstanding here is that Hinted Handoff does NOT mean “ignore W.” If it did, clearly R + W > N would mean nothing; in fact, W would be entirely superfluous. So to the degree that the Dynamo paper suggests otherwise, it should be treated as a “bug” in the paper.<p>So, just to treat your first example, with W=3,R=1 you can’t get inconsistent reads since writes will block if any replica is unavailable.<p>All quorum-based systems that I know of treat R + W like this. For Cassandra, see the code from StorageProxy.insertBlocking, specifically the calls to getNaturalEndpoints, getHintedEndpointMap, and getUnhintedNodes (and QuorumResponseHandler of course). Cassandra is careful to only hint N - W replicas as I’ve been discussing.<p>Everything else you object to basically falls out of this. For example, “there is no way in Dynamo to track how many pending updates have not been reflected globally” — which doesn’t matter, since either you are waiting for R + W > N, in which case you get consistency, or you are not, in which case you can’t complain if you don’t get it. :)",1257260355

919356,comment,919144,919144,0,0,jakarta,,,"The really interesting thing here is that Buffett is set to use Berkshire shares for the acquisition. I can’t remember the last time that he did this, I know he really regretted it with Dexter Shoe Co.:<p>In 1993, Berkshire paid $433 million for the Maine-based company. Rather than use cash, Buffett used Berkshire Class A stock to fund the purchase. That Berkshire stock is worth eight times more now, giving the Omaha, Nebraska-based insurance and investment company a $216 billion market value.<p>Dexter didn’t make it that long. It ended shoe production in the United States and Puerto Rico in 2001, and Berkshire folded what was left into its H.H. Brown Shoe Group unit.<p>“What I had assessed as durable competitive advantage vanished within a few years,” Buffett wrote on Friday. “By using Berkshire stock, I compounded this error hugely. That move made the cost to Berkshire shareholders not $400 million, but rather $3.5 billion. In essence, I gave away 1.6 percent of a wonderful business — one now valued at $220 billion — to buy a worthless business.”<p>“To date, Dexter is the worst deal that I’ve made,” Buffett went on. “But I’ll make more mistakes in the future – you can bet on that.

Interpreting lojban quite specifically is not unambiguous.<p>Given a grammatically correct construction there is a unique parse.  That is what is meant by ""unambiguous"".  There's no problems akin to ""Machines need to wreck a nice beach.""<p>There are manifold ambiguities, however, in the semantics.  When one talks of ""lo sutra tavla"" there is no indication as to the sense in which the speaker is fast.  Perhaps the speaker produces many words per minute, or perhaps the speaker runs past while talking.  These ambiguities can be reduced by using more precise expressions.  Metaphorical use is frowned upon, so what it does not mean is one who persuades in a fraudulent manner.<p>For example, we can say ""lo gerku"" which refers to a dog, or some dogs, but gives no idea of how many.  We could say ""re le ci gerku"", which means ""two of the three dogs.""  More precise.<p>I can say ""mi tavla"", which means ""I speak"" or ""I will speak"" or ""I have spoken"" and even leaves the audience, topic and language unspecified.  I can say ""mi ba tavla"" or ""mi pu tavla"" which are future and past respectively.  I can be even more precise if necessary or desirable.<p>You said in <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=918042"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=918042</a> :<p><pre><code>  ... my understanding based solely on reading ABOUT\n  Lojban, I don't know a single Lojban word... aside\n  from Lojban\n</code></pre>\nI think you have fallen into the trap of not reading enough, and mis-interpreting some of what you have read.<p>I'm not surprised, I think much of the early material written about lojban was written without regard for how it might be mis-interpreted.  Politicians today generally say nothing, because everything they do say runs the risk of being taken other than intended.  The early lojban writers (writing about lojban, not necessarily in lojban) needed ""spin doctors"" to ensure that what they said could not be mis-interpreted.<p>All that aside, lojban is intended to be an <i>expressive</i> language, suitable for communication.  Therefore it will be complex, although the complexities are not necessarily those of natlangs.  I suspect that we are not that far apart.  We agree that:<p>- lojban is complex<p>- lojban is not currently suited for general use<p>- lojban is cool<p>I further believe that:<p>- learning lojban (at least beyond ""mi tavla"") is mind-expanding<p>- learning the structures of lojban teach more than just lojban, they teach about structure, syntax, and monolinguistic assumptions.<p>- it's not for everyone.",1257258831

If it's better but only in limited conditions then can't you buy some and only use them in those limited conditions? Is military procurement really that broken.",1257256803

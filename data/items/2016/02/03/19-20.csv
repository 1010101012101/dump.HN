The frontend started out as PHP, eventually got compiled to C++ via HipHop, replaced HipHop with HHVM, and then added support for Hack.  My understanding is that they&#x27;re gradually adding more React to it as well.  FB also includes a number of specialized services, eg. Chat & Whatsapp are written in Erlang.<p>Google as written by Larry Page was done in Java.  It was rewritten in Python by Scott Hassan before the company was incorporated.  As of 1999, the webserver and crawler were still in Python.  It was almost completely rewritten (multiple times) in C++ shortly thereafter for efficiency.  Most of the Google Apps (GMail, Docs, Plus, etc.) are written in Java.  The webserver for Search shifted over to a combination of Java and two different DSLs in 2010; I worked on the implementation of this.  My comment is lightly paraphrased from a remark Larry Page gave when asked why Google doesn&#x27;t adopt more modern programming frameworks like Rails or Node (it was in 2011, when both of these were still state-of-the-art).",1454529589

The law provides a better paper trail to detect laundering.<p>> A law that makes it easier to indict criminals at the expense of making legitimate acts illegal is fundamentally at odds with the physical underpinnings that give us the &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; doctrine.<p>That&#x27;s circular logic. You claim something is a &quot;legitimate act&quot; but all illegal things were at one time legitimate acts: drinking & driving, guns on aircraft, drug usage, all computing crime, all financial crime, etc.<p>You can use that exact sentence and the logic held within to argue that all new laws of any nature violate &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; because inherently before the law was passed these were &quot;legitimate acts.&quot;",1454529486

They do get bad reputation by people who do heap allocations without thinking about them. \nThey key to good GC performance is about the allocation profile. GO gives you very good control about heap allocation, so it should be possible to arrange the main game loop such that no fresh heap is allocated, which also would mean that the GC does not run. The GO GC runs when, the allocated heap grow to a set multiple (by default 2x) of the heap size after the last GC run.

Wearing all the hats and the only technical hat initially puts you a lot closer to founder status.<p>3. “landing projects” doesn’t sound like a startup, sounds like a consultancy.  Taking reduced market salary here for equity doesn’t seem right, the equity will never likely payoff to justify it.<p>Step 1. Interview at big companies.  Figure out how much you could earn (total comp: salary, bonus, and guaranteed equity).  Also to get a BATNA.<p>Step 2. Value the startup.  Account for professional investors, market size, likelihood of success, etc.  Don&#x27;t just go off what the founders tell you.  Look at comparable startups and their exits.<p>Step 3. Figure out how much the money you gave up is worth.  Multiply it by 4 (last year plus the next 3) then figure out the percent of the company.  Would also probably double it for the risk you are taking.  (Note: You should immediately vest the prior year and have no cliff for the three remaining).<p>Step 4. Negotiate from a higher starting point (I’m a sucker for putting out what I think is fair and having it cut).  Be ready to walk with your BATNA. 5-10 percent might not be unreasonable with what you are bringing to the table, especially if this is more of a lifestyle business than a professionally backed startup.<p>Good luck and don&#x27;t be afraid to move.",1454529391

Racism is pretty clearly defined in terms of treating racial minorities as subhuman both in legal and social terms. The same follows for sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. The individual incident in question can be assessed pretty clearly by this standard. For example, if you insist on calling a POC &quot;boy&quot; when they&#x27;re 20 years your senior then you&#x27;re probably being a racist. Also, if you insist on calling Caitlyn Jenner by her old first name. Then you&#x27;re probably a transphobe. And so forth. This isn&#x27;t rocket science. If you can&#x27;t determine what&#x27;s bigotry either you&#x27;re not observant or you&#x27;re being dishonest. Either way, it&#x27;s not the job of the marginalized to coddle you.<p>2. Having your event canceled isn&#x27;t equivalent to censorship. No one has put a gag order on Smurthwaite to not perform. You&#x27;re not guaranteed a platform to speak either beyond the voting booth or to petition. It&#x27;s not the onus of individual organizations or individuals themselves to listen or debate you. The freedom of speech also implies the freedom to not listen to your speech. Or to not associate one&#x27;s organization or self in regards to that speech. If you don&#x27;t like this either, then IMO you&#x27;re demanding to be coddled.<p>So, all these false claims of PC being out of control smacks of social conservatives demanding to be taken seriously by their opposition. Guess what? They don&#x27;t talk their opposition seriously either. DEAL WITH IT is my motto. If you can&#x27;t then you&#x27;re a brat.",1454528371

Sure, YC throws out a fairly generous standard valuation, but they are choosing top notch startups and trying to cultivate an entrepreneur first mindset.<p>To roll into any random startup and say, “I guess 1 percent seems fair” is silly.  1-3 percent is fairly standard for the first employee of a well-backed (YC / VC / Quality Angel) startup, where professionals are taking a calculated risk because the payout could be huge.  They are really overvaluing every startup, but know that 1 out of 10 will pay off enough to make it up.<p>One percent probably isn’t fair for someone taking a reduced salary at a “startup” financed by someone’s uncle targeting a niche market.  The limited upside will never pay enough to justify the money lost.  If the startup isn’t financed by professionals, I don’t see 1-3 percent and reduced market as reasonable.  Even then, I think it’s questionable and really depends on the product, market, founders, how far along things are, and what you bring to the table.<p>Certainly the value you provide and what you can negotiate are the critical parts, but I feel that a lot of startup pay is exploitative, taking advantage of younger workers who don’t understand what is going on, that the real payday in a startup is the equity and they probably aren’t getting a large enough percent to justify the risk.

11028948,comment,11025618,11026100,0,0,mike_hearn,,,"You have to be very careful about these sorts of GC statistics. Things are often not quite what they seem and they depend a lot on the type of app you run.<p>The first thing to be aware of is that with modern collectors (I have no idea how modern Go&#x27;s new collector is though), GC pause time depends on how much live data there is in the young generation. So you can easily have enormous heaps with very low pause times if all your objects die young and hardly ever make it into the old generations, because then you never really need to collect the rest of the heap at all.<p>Of course, outside of synthetic benchmarks, many apps don&#x27;t show such pleasant behaviour, and often GC algorithms face difficult tradeoffs that are only really knowable by the developers. For instance, do you want low pause times, or less CPU used by the collector (higher throughput)? It turns out that&#x27;s a fundamental tradeoff and the right answer usually depends whether your app is a user facing server (needs low pause times) or a batch job (better to pause for long periods but complete faster). No runtime can know that, which is why the JVM has tons of tuning knobs. Left to its own devices you can theoretically get away with only tweaking a single knob which is target pause time (in G1). Set it lower and CPU usage of the collector goes up but it&#x27;ll try and pause for less time. Set it higher and the collector gets more efficient.<p>Or you can just buy Zing and get rid of GC pauses entirely.<p>So a stat by itself like &quot;20ms GC pauses on 200GB heaps&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean much by itself. You can get very low pause times with huge heaps out of the JVM as well:<p><pre><code>  http://www.slideshare.net/HBaseCon/dev-session-7-49202969\n</code></pre>\nbut of course, you have to pay the piper somehow ... assuming non-weird heap usage the program will run slower overall.",1454527494

There is no unsafe in the layout algorithms, just in the work-stealing deque and the logic to share DOM nodes over to the layout thread. You can think of both as low-level generic memory management primitives, essentially as a GC. We do <i>not</i> allow the layout logic to be unsafe.<p>As for string lists and such, those are core collections. Again, those are low-level primitives and relatively easy to prove safe. We should be migrating more of that code to the safe language, but it never causes problems in practice. That&#x27;s because the &quot;build simple abstractions out of unsafe primitives and keep the complicated code safe&quot; approach <i>works</i>. (We have empirical evidence that it works, you know. There are incredibly few segfaults in Servo relative to any other browser engine we&#x27;ve worked on.)<p>I am convinced that writing in Java would not make the browser any safer.

Google, Facebook, EBay) that had hit it big.<p>I started my career with the belief that your company has <i>one</i> tech stack, the chief architect chooses it when the company is founded, and that you never ever rewrite it because you&#x27;re in for a world of pain if you do.<p>I learned that basically no company that experiences hyper-growth ever does this.  Instead, the founder chooses a tech stack based on whatever he knows best and will let him write a v1 quickest - whether it be Java (Google), Perl (EBay), PHP (Facebook), or Common Lisp (Reddit).  The first few employees collectively say that the founder is an idiot, choose a different tech stack (usually whatever&#x27;s hot right now - probably Go or Node.js at this time, Python or Rails in 2005), and rewrite the whole product.  They hire an experienced VP who says that the first few employees are idiots, chooses a different tech stack (often the tried and true enterprise favorites of C++ or Java), and dictates that everyone rewrite the product.  Eventually, managers with more recent experience in that language get hired, who collectively say that that VP was an idiot, and the <i>real</i> way to do C++/Java is with Guice, Boost, C++11, etc, and rewrite the product that way.  Development grinds to a halt, and the company buys a bunch of hot startups who wrote in whatever language they were familiar with, who are technical idiots but managed to build a product that everyone likes.<p>In this context, Parse and other BaaS providers makes a lot of sense.  You can get your v1 product out there really quick, get customer feedback, improve it, take VC, and hire lots of programmers to call you an idiot and rewrite your product into something saner.  Then you get bought, everybody at the new company thinks you&#x27;re an idiot, but you have at least cashed out.  Or you don&#x27;t get bought and hire a VP who&#x27;ll force you to rewrite your product, but at this stage you have so much of a market lead that it doesn&#x27;t matter, and the BaaS got you to the point where you have the resources to free yourself of it.<p>(I wonder if I&#x27;ll end up tripping some HN flamewar auto-detector with the number of times I&#x27;ve said &quot;idiot&quot; in this post...)",1454527078

Then you build a proper searchable catalog for the products. Include lots of search criteria, sorting criteria, side-by-side comparison, recommended accessories, anything that would be useful for people looking to buy them.<p>Once my catalog contained over 1,000 models I started replying to posts on forums with a link to my site that provided what they were looking for. People loved the site and it wasn&#x27;t long before they were posting links to it to answer each others questions. That&#x27;s all it took to start ranking on Google which is now responsible for 3/4 of my traffic.<p>Initially this is not passive income.

Every semester when disbursement time came around, the university financial office would send me an email informing me of all the money that was coming in from scholarships and loans, how much of it would be applied to tuition, and the amount of the rest that would be deposited into my account. If I recall correctly, I think they even made me see the balance before the money would be disbursed.

It&#x27;s just terrible.<p>Interestingly, sets from about the 80&#x27;s onward can display 80 column text nicely, given a good DAC driven signal.  The signals from back then were square, or coarse, if not square.  This makes NTSC light right up.  I&#x27;ve been toying with a micro and a DAC and a full interlace, color phase shifting NTSC signal performs well on older analog sets.  If the timing is right for the digital ones, they do well too, but it&#x27;s all about hitting that 13.5Mhz sample window common to most digital sets today.<p>Back then, just having a full interlaced signal would have helped considerably with text, though at the expense of tearing.  Low ambient light and moderate contrast on the display would have largely mitigated this.<p>As we got Y-C capable displays, one could just use a resistor and send the composite signal into both inputs.

Truffle sits on top and uses aggressive partial evaluation to convert AST interpreters for dynamic scripting languages into JIT compilers automatically. They have a Javascript implementation that&#x27;s comparable to V8 in speed, and you can interop with it through safe APIs.

Here is a country which has all of the fundamental things it needs to be a vibrant, robust, and generally great country and yet it isn&#x27;t one.<p>It has natural resources which are in demand, and for which the tools and techniques to convert them into exchangable goods is well understood. It has few serious military threats from its neighbors and so militarily its primarily responsible for civil and criminal activities, and it has nominally &quot;easy&quot; access to nearby markets for trade goods (importing things it doesn&#x27;t have domestically).<p>But it also has people in &quot;charge&quot; to have no idea how running a country even works much less the forces that act on it. And as many anti-libertarians will point out, the lack of a competent government does not result in a paradise emerging from the work of motivated individual actors within.<p>And understanding that, go back to the founding of the US and its fits and starts trying to go from being a colony to being a country, and most importantly the constraints on their own actions that everyone had to agree to in order to get the Constitution done. Try to understand why that worked is an interesting (and perhaps vital) exercise. Was it the people? Their values? Their education? Their understanding? Was it coincidence or luck?<p>I find myself desperate to know why one institution works and another fails. Both large like nation-states, and small like companies. How is it &quot;no big deal&quot; for some companies to get a new CEO and catastrophic for others?",1454526141

They bribe some factory supervisor in Taiwan for the designs to a product. They cant understand anything about it but they decide to tweak it to make it cheaper. Their greatly underpaid sole engineer discovers his girlfriend is cheating with the main entrepreneur guy. This is pretty disgusting because engineer man is a good guy and main guy has an underage girlfriend living in a plywood loft built inside a storage unit. One day engineer man says &quot;fuck this I&#x27;m going to be a fucking farmer now&quot;. He modifies the designs to suck before grabbing a check from the middle of the stack in the printer and heads out the door. Six months later the factory in Taiwan wants the designs for the new product. Main guy digs around on the file system and finds the modified stuff. His new engineer just started and isnt really an engineer but rather an engineering student- he says he will &quot;do the needful&quot;. Instead of looking over the designs new engineer plays rocket league and smokes weed. Another six months later engineer guy is growing organic carrots and heritage lambs with his new gf who has kind of fucked up feet and not great teeth but she&#x27;s nice to him and is good at farm chores. At night he goes to read /r/girlsgoodatfarmchores and at some point sees a link to a video of a cable frying the shit out of the thing its plugged into. &quot;Huh, I really ought to clean this shit out from under my fingernails&quot; he thinks.",1454526122

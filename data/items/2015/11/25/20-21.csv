10629622,comment,10627787,10627787,0,0,msie,,,"I liked the following comment.\nThe speaker himself is probably biased as to what happened to him:<p><i>As a student of ‘centerville high school’ as well, I can assure you this comment is completely true. While multiple questions were phrased as attacks towards Haidt personally, many of them were completely rational. In response to one question (about his annoyance towards people who are pushing women to be in more stem positions) he stated a very vague position on how women, no matter their environmental conditions in childhood, are still predisposed to not be in stem positions (genetically).\nThis was not the only ‘sketchy’ point he made. The question about his condoning of rape, while completely unnecessary, was founded on his insensitivity towards the subject (which continued into many subjects, including race and gender).\nHis careful picking of data allowed his points to made clearly and succinctly in his mind. Questions that were too long or that had follow ups were completely ignored. In response to one of the first (albeit angry and unnecessary) questions, Haidt’s response was to tell the audience that in order to fully look at an argument, one had to look at both sides, something I (as someone who did believe in a large amount of what Haidt was saying) had to scoff at. His entire argument was founded on the idea that everyone being free to say whatever they want is the best thing possible for American schools, while being politically correct in all scenarios is the worst thing possible for American schools. Obviously there are positive and negative aspects to both. This completely contradicts his belief to look at both sides of an argument dispassionately, not to mention being hard, as students who do care about their education, to listen to.\nHaidt’s talk was difficult to listen to. Even though I believe in almost all of his points (despite being part of many, although not all, of the minority groups mentioned) his inability to speak to us effectively (in a way that didn’t seem like he condoned rape) made it so that his argument was not relayed to us clearly. His blatant misunderstanding of his audience put him in the position to be attacked.\nOne can say that he did that on purpose, to prove his point about shaking those who do walk on eggshells. But that doesn’t work. Telling defensive people their wrong doesn’t work. Sorry.</i>",1448484885

10629618,comment,10627787,10629496,0,0,marknutter,,,"> Discussing nursing isn&#x27;t relevant, and even if it is two wrongs don&#x27;t make a right, which is the logical fallacy you keep making here. But if you want to hear me say it: there&#x27;s a shortage of nurses and the fact that men aren&#x27;t going into it due to social pressures is an issue.<p>As long as we&#x27;re pointing out fallacies, you&#x27;re attacking a straw man here. I&#x27;m not saying two wrongs make a right; I&#x27;m saying neither wrong is actually a wrong. They are simply outcomes, neither negative nor positive. The overarching point I&#x27;m trying to make is that if we both agree we need more nurses, and we both agree we need more techies, and we both agree that men tend toward tech and women tend toward nursing, and operating under the assumption that it&#x27;s a zero sum game (hint: it&#x27;s not), then there&#x27;s nothing wrong with women staying in nursing to keep the overall number of nurses high and men staying in tech to keep the overall number of techies high.<p>I simply do not see the need for the fields of nursing and tech to swap genders until they both hit some gender equilibrium. The goal should be to increase the overall volume of both nurses and techies (and decrease, perhaps, the number of lawyers ;-).<p>And by the way, the other day my 3 year old daughter told me she wants to be a nurse when she grows up. It would feel wrong to discourage her by pushing her toward a career in programming, but maybe that&#x27;s just me.<p>edit: grammar and added the bit about increasing overall volume of nurses and techies",1448484861

10629602,comment,10620410,10628978,0,0,ohyes,,,"> Now say I make $100k a year. I&#x27;d probably be paying $30-45k a year in tax (depending on the country). This is getting to the point where you&#x27;re no longer getting enough value for your $/€.<p>I Disagree.<p>The money you&#x27;re getting paid in is a construct of the government that you&#x27;re paying taxes to. You wouldn&#x27;t even be able to collect $/€ for your goods and services without taxes. So you&#x27;d have to barter and stockpile basic commodities in order to barter for other things that you need. Can you imagine buying an iPhone with corn or oil? Or collecting ad click through revenue in gold? There would size-able inefficiencies just because of the need to hold &#x27;stuff&#x27; rather than an imaginary thing.<p>Furthermore the marginal utility of a government backing the currency that you use is proportional to your income. Someone living in relative poverty probably could provide for their basic needs without currency (think peasants or yeoman farmers scraping out a living, basically self sufficient, or tradesmen exchanging services for necessary goods... vs. a hedge fund manager).<p>I can&#x27;t imagine someone making the equivalent of 1/2 million a year having an easy way of storing and maintaining that value (particularly the excess beyond what they spend) without a currency (or even being able to collect it in the first place). (Remember the markets are settled in currency and all accounting is done based on currency, you can&#x27;t just invest in AAPL with corn).<p>I can&#x27;t imagine a normal person owning an iPhone and buying apps from an app store under the hypothetical situation. It seems to me to have a very high utility to the individual at the top of the income chain. You are completely ignoring many of the benefits of having a functional government and a stable society with many consumers (whose consumption is supported by those tax dollars) who are able to consume because of the constructs put in place by a treasury and a tax structure.<p>I think you&#x27;re underestimating the intangible value returned by governance. It is near non-finite.<p>So assuming governance and currency (we can agree these have utility?), taxes can be looked at as being closer to a hedge against inflation than anything else (that is, they prevent devaluation of the currency). As a thought experiment, imagine if the government weren&#x27;t allowed to collect taxes AT ALL.<p>How would it fund itself?<p>Well it controls the treasury, so it would print money, and it would issue debt (bonds). It already does this, incidentally. Both of these things would devalue the currency. (Printing money means more in circulation (its easier to get... therefore worth less), whereas a bond would promise of a certain amount of money that I plan to print in the future). These can be treated as similar, at very least.<p>So the real (interesting) question about taxes is tax structure. If we assume a flat % tax, it is pretty close to the above devaluation scheme. If we assume a flat $ amount, it very quickly becomes regressive, disproportionately penalizing the poor a large percentage of their money, preventing them from having anything to spend at all. That&#x27;s how you get a revolution.<p>With a progressive tax structure, those who can comfortably pay more, do pay more, those who can&#x27;t don&#x27;t. (All the way down to certain people being taxed negative amounts in certain situations).<p>All that said.<p>Yes, sure, the corporation should move to jurisdictions which are the most friendly to its tax status... it is a fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders, anything else and they are leaving money on the table. At the same time, powerful governments should pressure these corporations into giving them a cut of any business that they do under that government&#x27;s jurisdiction. In fact, they have a responsibility to do this so that the government can continue functioning properly.",1448484663

Did I not sound serious enough? Are you addressing the content within my argument or the tone of my argument?<p>I&#x27;m not being fatalistic, I&#x27;m genuinely asking those questions. I have a lot of male friends who didn&#x27;t go into tech <i>or</i> nursing who are really struggling. One might go as far as to say they were &quot;actively discouraged from nursing early on&quot; while my female acquaintances happily slid into comfy and lucrative nursing positions. Yet, not once have I heard of or seen advertisements for Men in Nursing conferences or groups. I&#x27;m not making this &quot;us&quot; vs &quot;them&quot; as much as you want to frame my argument that way, and even if I did you&#x27;d have to explain why you think that leads to gendered professions.<p>> You&#x27;re ignoring the social aspect. Women are often discouraged from tech early on, which makes the profession more male-dominated, which makes women feel less comfortable, etc.<p>Again, I could make the same (bad) argument by replacing &quot;women&quot; with &quot;men&quot; and &quot;tech&quot; with &quot;nursing&quot;. Unless you&#x27;re also willing to admit the problem exists there and needs to be dealt with, then I&#x27;m not sure we have much more to discuss.<p>If however, you do think the gender imbalance in the field of nursing is a problem, then I need to be educated as to <i>why</i> it&#x27;s a problem. I&#x27;ve heard arguments about <i>why</i> we need to get more women in tech, but they&#x27;ve never made a whole lot of sense to me.<p>You know what we need more of in tech? People. Period. Far too few people chose CS as their field of study and as such there&#x27;s a huge mismatch between supply and demand. If your mission is to increase the volume of people in tech, regardless of their race, gender, age, or creed, then count me in and how can I help?<p>edit: accidentally a word",1448482632

Microsoft&#x27;s support policies for the OS components has long held that what they will provide (extended) support for is the most recent Service Pack version that has kept up with Windows Updates. For various reasons, companies have tried to take advantage of the fact that IE is an OS component to qualify it for extended support and also taking advantage of the concept that IE updated/versioned at a slightly different pace from Windows Service Packs to assume that they could claim the extended support timeframe for an individual IE release as if it were entire OS versions.<p>The amazing thing is that Microsoft took this long to correct what should have been an obvious mistake: that IE versions apply like other Windows components and they should only need to support the most up to date one for that OS version.<p>The kind thing here is that Microsoft has taken ownership of that mistake, publicly admitted that they made it and that the fix was coming, and given companies more than a year and a half (and advertising to that effect, such as the site linked here) to adjust to the fix.",1448482256

I can agree with the wrong but am less convinced about the common.<p>I never saw a clean definition of p-value or alpha -- probability of Type I error.<p>In my study of statistics, p-value and alpha are essentially the same.  Maybe a difference:  A p-value is what a researcher has in mind before the hypothesis test as a &#x27;cutoff value&#x27;, say, 5%, for alpha while alpha is whatever the statistical hypothesis test says, for the data and the test, is the probability of Type I error, e.g., 3.141592653 or some such random number.  So, since the 3.14 is less than the p-value of 5%, the experimenter rejects the null hypothsis.  MAYBE this is the difference, if any, between p-value and alpha, in which case we&#x27;re talking a triviality.<p>The paper you referenced also starts to get wound up over beta = 1 - alpha as the <i>power</i> of a test.  Okay, but that little equation is the definition of <i>power</i>.  So,if have some data and a p-value or alpha in mind, and have several candidate statistical hypothesis tests, say, some <i>parametric</i> and the others <i>distribution-free</i>, etc., then will want to use the test with the smallest probability of Type II error, that is, the largest beta.  Okay.  Now are done with beta, and no more strain or struggle needed.<p>A biggie point is the real role of the null hypothesis -- it lets us calculate some probabilities that, otherwise, we would not have assumptions enough to do.<p>If there was a fight between Fisher and Neyman-Pearson nearly 100 years ago, then I&#x27;m sorry, but now I have no sympathy for whatever the heck, if anything, they were arguing about then.",1448481982

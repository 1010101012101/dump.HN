1136351,comment,1135538,1135951,0,0,chipsy,,,"Seconded.<p>If you're in gamedev(as I am), you're essentially going into it as your lifestyle. You can make it a reasonably sane, healthy one if you can find a niche and make it as an indie, but good money won't ever be the motivating factor, and working in the studio environment is harsh and essentially requires migrating to find new work every time you're taken off a project. When new segments take off, like casual gaming did a few years ago, or social gaming more recently, you have a better chance of money and stable employment, but it'll fade away when the market saturates.<p>That said, the bar to make it is really high. It's not as impossibly high as making it as a musician, I think, because the variety of situations and skillsets is exponentially larger in the interactive multimedia context - so you always have less competition for your particular skillset - but it's definitely harder than ""business programming"" because you can add as many technical challenges as you want(soft real-time simulations, physics, graphics, audio, world persistence, networking, tools+scaffolding....) and still have only scratched the surface on what the computer is potentially capable of as an entertainment device.<p>If you take pains to avoid technical challenges you can make games more quickly, but you have to take on at least one or two to have a game, and adding more usually helps quality. Plus, the code alone doesn't make a game. The final game is the result of code+assets+design+player feedback - and lots of meticulous details. Game design isn't terribly different from business in that you have to make tons of hard decisions with little information immediately available. And like in business, you can get more info, but you have to work at it.",1266561844

But as I responded to someone below, I actually have a slightly more disciplined approach to my idea making. What you refer to as an idea, is the first of 7 stages an idea goes through with me. I call them sparks, or seeds. Some of these make it through all the stages, ending up as a physical prototype, or even a piece of beta software, some of them get shot down early in the process due to them being crap, or due to the fact that I don't have enough knowledge of the specific field to take it any further without knowing if I'm heading into ""complete bunk"" territory. That's why I have a few ideas which are math based that are stuck in limbo: I am currently trying to research what work had been done on the problems, and then how to teach myself the relevant skills to see if I can move with the ideas themselves.

1136342,comment,1136261,1136261,0,0,kyro,,,"I'd add a few more things. Make sure your shirt and jacket fit. The most common things I see are men with collars too big for them so there's this huge gap between the front of the neck and the knot of the tie. Make sure your shirt fits snug, along with the suit jacket. The suit jacket should follow the contour of your sides, not hang straight down. It should look tailor-made for your body shape, and those with jackets that drop straight down on the sides look as if they purchased a one-size-fits-all suit. Also, ties should reach mid-buckle, and the knot should be appropriate for the occasion. I see lots of guys at weddings who tie their knot using the simplest method and it looks too casual. Look up various tie knots like the half-windsor, etc. And as he said, your pants should reach the floor, but they should also drape nicely around your shoes. I see lots of guys with bulky dress shoes that cause scrunching of the pant leg at the ankle because there's not enough room for the pants to fit over the shoe and drape; so pick slim fitting shoes.<p>I disagree with him on the shinier the shoe the dressier and that they should be made of leather.

It's a blog and it's her personal space, she can use whatever font she wants and it's totally fine. I did of course get so shocked by it i had to inspect elements and thought, ""She's going crazy with her fonts here.""<p>If you aren't a professional, stick to arial and verdana and the web will thank you.",1266559512

Maybe the problem is the hideous crap imposed on paying customers by the gaming company and they should make the customer experience at least as good as the pirate experience.<p>For example, allow the game to work just fine offline and give you an option <i>you can turn off</i> to phone home when you have an internet connection. But if you turn it on, every once in a while you are randomly selected to receive a bonus of some kind in the game.",1266559474

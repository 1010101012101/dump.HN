The iPhone has already taken over some of the central functions of my brain. It has replaced part of my memory, storing phone numbers and addresses that I once would have taxed my brain with. It harbors my desires: I call up a memo with the names of my favorite dishes when I need to order at a local restaurant. I use it to calculate, when I need to figure out bills and tips. It is a tre- mendous resource in an argument, with Google ever present to help settle disputes. I make plans with it, using its calendar to help deter- mine what I can and can’t do in the coming months. I even daydream on the iPhone, idly calling up words and images when my concentra- tion slips.

1473346,story,,,2,4,unknown_user,"Ask HN: Am I spamming my customers?",,"Hi, I'm looking for advice as to whether it's legitimate for me to send a product upgrade email to a group of people who have a license for my product.<p>Here's the story: I'm an independent developer and licenses for one of my products was given away in a promotion run by a third party earlier in the year. A condition of getting the license was that they had to register with the third parties site and then go through a virtual purchase process which cost them nothing. At this point I don't think there was any kind of check if they were willing to receive email.<p>At the end of the promotion the third party supplied me with the email addresses of the people who downloaded the license, about 30,000 of them.<p>The product has changed significantly since then and I 'd like to send these people an email informing them about the changes but I'm concerned at being branded a spammer and the potential backlash against the product.<p>What do you think, can I email these people even though they haven't explicitly signed up for it?<p>My gut feeling is that I shouldn't but I'm wondering if I'm being over cautious here?",1277856100

Those 2 sites cater primarily to vacation/2nd home owners (i.e. renting out an entire house/condo for week). You don't see many ""Rent out my extra bedroom for $60/night"" listings on there. Unless I'm mistaken, that's where AirBnB differentiates itself and, IMO, makes it more risky.",1277856057

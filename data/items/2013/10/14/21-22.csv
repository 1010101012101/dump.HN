One astonishing thing I&#x27;ve learned while becoming more active is what a normal body is really capable of without going into the realm of professional athletes. Running a marathon with a slow pace is really feasible. So is lugging a 15-20kg backpack for 35-40km per day for about a month or rock climbing/bouldering in the lower difficulties. To achieve either of it you wont need a very hard exercise regimen either, rather persistence.<p>Please don&#x27;t take this as personal criticism. I just find it important to point out that there is a huge gap between what people unfamiliar with sport perceive as achievements and what actually are achievements. Just put in 4 hours of running and 4 hours of climbing per week and you will see for yourself.<p>Edit: Or I just failed to see the sarcasm in your post. Entirely possible :)",1381787847

The opportunities for a wider range of connections and possibilities are what breathe life into a city--what has allowed San Francisco to make the transition away from industry as gracefully as it has.\nManhattan is the nucleus of New York. San Francisco is the nucleus of the Bay Area. If you lose that center, you end up with the nonsense sprawl that is LA. No common place for people to meet and come together. No way to rationalize or prioritize transit and other public needs.\nThe solution doesn&#x27;t have to be subsidized housing. Better public transit allows people to reside further away and still have access to the city&#x27;s opportunities, and gives everyone more mobility. But if it is becomes impossible for new people and young people to access the city because of pricing or traffic, how can San Francisco continue to flourish?

6549875,comment,6546768,6549384,5,0,jameshart,,,"The thing is that anywhere in your code where you are doing something which involves hashing data to create a digest for some purpose you are almost certainly attempting to do something a bit <i>clever</i> (I&#x27;m going to map the problem from the domain of entities to a domain of proxies for entities that are smaller and easier to deal with. I&#x27;ll just deal with the special cases...). And if you&#x27;re making a decision to use Murmur2 in that role, you&#x27;re probably trying to be <i>very clever</i>. Whenever a programmer tries to do something clever, in my experience, there is something they haven&#x27;t thought about. Often the something they haven&#x27;t thought about leads to a security vulnerability.<p>The fact is it&#x27;s often difficult to tell the difference between a place where the security properties of the digest algorithm you use are irrelevant, and a place where it might be critical. For example, a zip file uses a CRC32 checksum to validate each file; git uses SHA1 to uniquely identify objects; CouchDB shard mapping uses a strategy based on CRC32... if git had used murmur, would that cause problems for it? Is CouchDB being <i>clever</i> by using a fast hash for sharding at the expense of being secure?<p>Now, quick, make a decision which algorithm to use to generate Etag headers for your web API HTTP response entities: are you going to go with SHA256 or Murmur2? Murmur2 is much faster, and it&#x27;s certainly a <i>clever</i> solution... but are you sure you didn&#x27;t create a security hole?<p>I&#x27;m not saying &quot;nobody ever got fired for choosing SHA256,&quot; but I am kind of saying that you have to be very sure you know the security model you&#x27;re operating in before you build on a hash algorithm that doesn&#x27;t provide strong extension and preimage resistance.",1381787545

Since modern ATMs already have quite sophisticated OTR on the input side -- I&#x27;ve found them very accurate lately at recognizing even sloppy handwriting on checks -- this is quite plausible technologically.

I&#x27;ll use a personal anecdote to explain what I mean, though I acknowledge that not everyone shares my situation.<p>In college, I used Google for 90% of my assigned research papers.

The other 10% of the time, I had professors who required book sources and sometimes ask me to bring the books to class.<p>Retrieving book sources always seemed like a pain in the ass.

All I&#x27;m seeing here is Bill Gates bashing with no actual substance.<p>If Gates didn&#x27;t have the trust fund, and didn&#x27;t invest it into Microsoft, then why are you referring to it as somehow indicting his success?<p>In fact, the IBM exec is not how Microsoft got the contract for DOS. Microsoft was already a very successful software company by the time the deal with IBM was signed, they had millions in profit in 1980 (in 1980 dollars).<p>They already had the equivalent of $60 to $80 million in sales (2013 dollars) in fiscal 1980, with 40 employees. They did the equivalent of $130 million in sales in 1981 (DOS 1.0 was first released in August 1981). If you understand anything about the software market&#x27;s history, you understand how already substantial that was at the time for a stand-alone software business. Fact is, Microsoft was already one of the biggest software companies before they ever signed that deal.<p>IBM was looking to compete with Apple and others in a very important, fast growing market for personal computing. A multi-billion dollar market opportunity at the time (1980 dollars at that).<p>Your claim is that IBM would have just given that opportunity to any &#x27;kids&#x27; with a half-way connection to an IBM exec (that one of the most powerful companies on earth would rest a multi-billion dollar, critical, opportunity with somebody just over one modest connection). It&#x27;s an absurd position to put it nicely.",1381787205

Maybe you want to add additional dimensions to that dot plot. Maybe you want the dots&#x27; size or color to be mapped to different aspects of your data. In a world without ggplot2 (or more generally the grammar of graphics), you&#x27;re pretty much stuck going to a very primitive drawing system in which you&#x27;re specifying the virtual path of a pen, or working with basic geometric figures.<p>The grammar of graphics and ggplot2 occupy a sweet middle ground between being able to simply pick an off-the-shelf visualization, and needing to draw the whole damn works manually. And because the grammar really is consistent, you can also play with different facets of your data and build completely different charts to see which is better at presenting your thesis.<p>In short, ggplot2 rocks, Hadley/Leland rock, and a port of ggplot2 to Python is nothing but good news for the Python community.",1381787037

I&#x27;m not optimistic that that will even help your fellow customers, as I learn more about current genomics research.

That&#x27;s not an incomplete understanding, it&#x27;s wrong.<p>Granted, it&#x27;s wrong <i>because</i> of an incomplete understanding of bitcoin mining, which is that there are two parts to the reward. However, an incorrect conclusion based on incomplete information is still an incorrect conclusion.<p>Your statement, today, is probably correct. The percentage payout per block is probably worth a lot less than the value of the 25 bitcoins currently being rewarded. As others have stated, that&#x27;ll probably change as the reward drops.<p>Besides only including transactions that pay a higher percentage in a block, I imagine that the higher hashrates will allow more transactions to be included in each block, so there are two ways miners can increase their return. Miners aren&#x27;t just competing on speed to get the next block; they also have to get the largest block that includes the most transactions. When a transaction gets included in more than one block, the larger block &#x27;wins&#x27;.<p>I suspect we&#x27;re going to see a parallel to the transition from faster CPUs to multi-core CPUs that occurred when CPUs stopped getting faster. Until this year, we were seeing faster and faster software and hardware used to calculate hashes for bitcoin mining, but ASICs are almost certainly the end of that advancement. So now, I think, we&#x27;re going to see miners expanding their capability horizontally by hashing in parallel... Maybe by splitting twice as many transactions as typically used today into two different blocks and trying to hash both at the same time.",1381786664

My life has been filled with people charging down the wrong path because they have elevated system/process over goals.<p>For example: Agile/Yourdon/waterfall/XP/ISO9001/whatever. Our <i>goal</i> is a working system on time and budget (or whatever your goals are). The strategy is, perhaps, iterative waterfall, or agile, or more likely, some hybid approach (hint: how likely is small scale scrum to work to build a new Boeing, and how likely is the ideal Boeing process likely to create a great social web app). Systems are based on a number of assumptions about your goals; assumptions that may not apply, or that may change over time. If you aren&#x27;t continually testing your chosen strategy (I prefer strategy over system, but I more or less mean the same thing here) against your goals, you are likely to be anywhere from sub-optimal to completely wrong.<p>So I live in a world where everyone is currently chasing Agile, without questioning whether it even fits the problem, or what its weaknesses are (even if it fits, it has weaknesses, and you should be aware of it so you can mitigate them). I live in a world where people grind through business processes, without questioning whether this is taking us where we actually need to go, or whether things have changed and our goals, which inform the system, still apply. To use the example in the article, it makes no sense to search for another job if you are retiring in a year. If the externals change and system does not, you are in trouble.",1381786381
6549787,comment,6543892,6547839,1,0,Jamiecon,,,"I think that the tax break the article is talking about is the fact that in the UK, if your &#x27;main residence&#x27; is elsewhere, you only pay <i>income</i> tax on your UK earnings. That&#x27;s different to the US where (I believe) citizens are expected to pay tax even if they are non-resident. I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s mentioned to be honest as income taxes are not related to just buying a house in the UK - which anyone can do whether they are a citizen, resident, or whatever.<p>Council tax in the UK is payable by the building owner or tenant, and is much lower than, for example, the US property tax. Council tax is supposed to just pay for municipal services. IIRC, they even break it down into bits on your bill &#x27;Police - xx, Fire Brigade - xx&#x27; etc etc<p>I suppose my points were firstly that it is unreasonable to compare UK council tax and US property tax, and secondly that a tax directly related to a home&#x27;s value can impact people disproportionately due to the crazy rise in UK house prices over the last few decades.<p>All that said, the idea of a property tax level resetting when a building is sold is very interesting - I didn&#x27;t realise that was the case in California and it certainly makes sense. However, there is still the issue of our system of government being different - local governments can&#x27;t create new taxes (and it would need to be a local tax since the problem is restricted to one geographic area), and the economics are different - people just aren&#x27;t set up to pay high property taxes. Not insurmountable problems, I accept.<p>And yeah, 99 year leases are weird, but not uncommon. It gets weirder. For example it&#x27;s not that unusual in the UK for properties to be totally surrounded by land owned by others. Also, land ownership in the UK (London especially) often has crazy disputes just due to the age of the records.",1381786372

You can do almost anything you want with this connection, since your paying for the full cost. Run servers, re-sell it to others at markup, host hundreds of websites on it, anything that&#x27;s legal to do in the US, you can do with this connection.<p>However, most people can&#x27;t afford $500/month at their house, and most people would like to have faster download speeds than 20mb. These folks might instead buy a Comcast residential plan that offers 50mb down, 10mb up, for roughly $80 (which is what that plan costs here).<p>$80/month is a lot cheaper than $500/month. The reason it&#x27;s cheaper is because you agree to use it very lightly (no servers, no commercial use, no re-selling, keep total bandwidth use under 250-500GB, ect).<p>What some people try to do, is &#x27;cheat&#x27; that system. They try to buy a &#x27;home&#x27; connection, and run their business-level services on it. ISP&#x27;s crack down on that, because it&#x27;s not fair to the others whose service that person is disrupting.<p>However, some home users have legitimate home uses that <i>appear</i> to be cheats in the system. Running a Minecraft server for your friends is a &#x27;valid&#x27; home use, but it sometimes conflicts with an ISP&#x27;s rule (which might make an assumption that all servers are &#x27;business class only&#x27; uses).<p>- - -<p>Sometimes it gets trickier -- where there&#x27;s competition, anyone can buy high speed internet. (Urbanized Cities are usually ok here, lots of people sell Fiber lines / Metro Ethernet / Microwave / ect).<p>But at your house, there&#x27;s usually zero competition by law. A provider like Comcast might be the only option you have for high speed internet (perhaps they bought exclusive franchise rights to your city, or perhaps your state or local level government has created a law preventing new providers from competing in your area (this isn&#x27;t just theoretical, both of those things commonly happen in the USA)<p>At this point, your usually stuck. The provider was given monopoly status, but isn&#x27;t being controlled by the regulations needed to ensure it doesn&#x27;t abuse it&#x27;s monopoly status. What can you do, besides raise a lot of complaints about that monopoly provider&#x27;s rules.<p>- - -<p>TL/DR : Home users never pay for most of the speeds they get. Therefore, those speeds have to be shared among lots of people. ISP&#x27;s use rules to make sure everyone shares nicely. By default, those rules are overly harsh. Good ISP&#x27;s properly loosen the restrictions to allow obviously-good home uses.",1381785508

Also for them it&#x27;s easy to understand that outcomes are very poor indicator of good behavior. At least in &quot;short term&quot; but in many games the short term is sometimes several months or more.

It certainly does in single-threaded, &quot;one-session&quot;-esque tests, and the margin of its victory makes me think that hardware-accelerated GCM would be hard to beat by anything.<p>On my machine, a single thread/core running nothing but AES-GCM can encrypt/decrypt 8192 byte blocks of data at 1.32 GiB/s (this is using OpenSSL&#x27;s benchmarking feature). Yes, that&#x27;s gigabytes, not gigabits. It&#x27;s literally faster than IO for my SSD. (Salsa20, without a MAC, can do the same at about 0.64 GiB/s.)<p>When I told OpenSSL to use four threads in parallel, it ranked at 5.01 GiB/s, which is absolutely crazy.<p>That said, beyond a general leaning towards AES-GCM (simply because <i>it is so fast</i> with hardware acceleration), I don&#x27;t have any hard data on which would be the victor.

(And I know you&#x27;re saying you know such reasons might exist, but I think it&#x27;s worthwhile to go into them:)<p>One is logistics: a program to reach <i>everybody</i> unlocks some economies of scale. Much of the cost of these programs is just getting supplies and people to all of these remote villages with impassable roads, the occasional corrupt official or militia, etc.[1] Some of that is effectively fixed cost, and doesn&#x27;t vary much whether you have two boxes of deworming pills in the back of your truck or 20. The cost per person is lower if you can amortize those fixed costs across everyone.<p>The other is that sometimes active encouragement is worth it. Even rich countries have policies to try and get folks to vaccinate and for other health goals like getting people off cigarettes or fighting obesity. In poor countries there are two further reasons a push could help: there&#x27;s not enough accurate, trusted medical info (not even high school bio for everyone; that&#x27;s part of how &quot;traditional healers&quot; survive), and the cost of a vaccine feels a lot higher.[2]<p>All that said, I get the frustration that there are so many big problems aid like this _doesn&#x27;t_ directly help with. There&#x27;s partly just a problem of scale--you need a lot more resources (whether investment or aid or what) to deal with the lack of infrastructure, etc. But I do think in the meantime, the science and to some extent plain old arithmetic indicate that basic health programs are still doing a ton of good.<p>[1] Digression, but if you want to read about what it&#x27;s like to take the long way to a remote old tin mining town in the DRC, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/1851689656/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/1851689656/</a> is amazing<p>[2] Same thing was said, perhaps better, by <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Development-Practice/Are-bednets-really-the-best-investment-in-preventing-malaria"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Development-Practice/Are-bednets-really...</a>",1381784963

Here&#x27;s one example:<p><a href=""https://github.com/dominicsayers/isemail"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dominicsayers/isemail</a><p>The regex&#x27;s floating around out there are horrible.<p>Validating email addresses doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that you affect the user&#x27;s experience.  I think of it as an opportunity to avoid losing a potential customer due to a silly mistake.  One such example would be a one page sign-up site where you are trying to collect the email addresses of those interested in your offering.  In this context it is important to try and catch errors.  You have a visitor who wants to keep in touch with you.  He or she mistypes the email address.  If you don&#x27;t detect it you might lose them forever.<p>Granted, all errors are not detectable.  If someone types jeo@example.com vs. joe@example.com there&#x27;s precious little you can do about it in terms of automated detection.<p>You can accept obviously bad email addresses, store them in your database and simply tag them as such.  This is where ML or human intervention might be able to fix the problem or choose to discard it.  Email list pollution can be dealt with in other ways, for example, if you use this list to reach out to prospective customers bad emails will simply bounce.<p>In the end what is important is to avoid losing real potential customers as much as possible.  I think a little software-based verification along with giving the user the opportunity to catch the mistake is enough.

I've heard exchanges like:<p><pre><code>  officer: Don't go anywhere\n  friend: Am I under arrest?\n  officer: No, but don't go anywhere.\n  friend: If I'm not under arrest, then I'm leaving.\n  officer: If you leave, I *will* arrest you with impeding an investigation / obstruction of justice\n</code></pre>\n(That exchange followed from someone not involved in a protest, who was filming police officers trying to contain a protest. They tried to fine her friend $400 for littering (i.e. a candy wrapper that was already on the ground) or something equally ridiculous when you consider the amount of time (and tax-payer money) that they wasted harassing her and her friends.)<p>Also, in a number of jurisdictions, you can be arrested for being 'drunk and disorderly' with only the officer's word that you were actually drunk and/or causing a scene.<p>Keep in mind, that it doesn't matter much whether or not the charges stick. The police have successfully harassed you if you have to spend the night (or weekend) in prison before you are able to get out (and/or get the charges dismissed).<p>{update} Some corrections. Also, the 'investigation' that was being impeded was a $400 fine for littering a candy wrapper (ignoring whether or not the candy wrapper was actually littered).",1280959108

For example, if you have sensitive data in a production environment, maybe you don't want developers to have access to the environment regardless of the size of the organization.

The very graphs you linked to in your original post, the ones that you said were ""flat out"" wrong, themselves showed that poll was faster with smaller numbers of inactive fds on certain benchmarks.<p>And you don't need a benchmark to find it out, either.  Just think about it.  Poll doesn't scale because even when you have a ton of dead connections, you still have to iterate over every single fd that you're tracking when you're notified of an event.  The array that you get back from epoll only contains active fds.  As the active/total ratio goes up, you're eventually going to be doing just as much work as you would be doing with poll (iterating over every single fd), except you're also going to have taken the hit of the work to support epoll itself.<p>In other words, when ATR reaches a certain threshold, setting aside the possibility of a confounding (there you go, I used your word du jour) implementation detail, there's no possible way epoll can be as fast or faster than poll.  It will always be slower.  And if you never realized it, it's simply because you didn't stop and give it 5 seconds of thought, not because you were lured in by the malicious lies of the ignorant epollers.<p>The only interesting thing your original post illustrated vis-a-vis poll vs epoll was what the actual threshold was for your particular machine and benchmark.<p>Superpoll is an interesting idea, but there are serious issues with the approach you described.  By adding the overhead of managing the epoll/poll migrations, you're inherently going to negatively impact the pure performance of both.  I might have read it wrong, but it also sounded like you intended to start connections off in poll and migrate them over to epoll as their activity ratio went down.  But with that approach, if you're getting spiky traffic that hits once and then just waits for the connection to time out, you're getting the absolute worst of poll, and then possibly spending the time to migrate over to epoll where it's just going to wait to die anyways.<p>Anyways, getting a negative response is hardly justification for posting someone's picture and ridiculing his appearance.  It's that kind of behavior that makes people decide you're not worth dealing with regardless of how good your code is or how smart you are.",1280956593

Maybe the difference can be as much as 20-30% with a bad logo, but you wouldn't know by A/B testing two random designs.<p>Regarding the logos' aesthetics, a lot of people want to chime in and they probably have something to their point, however since they are not designers they do not have the experience of knowing what people in general find aesthetically pleasing. Because when you design things for people you learn that you can't find anything that everybody likes, you can only find something that a greater percentage of people will find more beautiful than the next thing. You almost learn that designing based on your own opinion will always yield poor results, so you design based on what you've learned that the biggest percentage of people will like.",1280956004

Meanwhile, said citizen would still be benefiting from the expenditures made by that same government (defense, highways, welfare net, etc.) I didn't even list all the loopholes or flaws with it (for example, no gift tax allows some pretty evil hacks to evade paying taxes as well. Also a citizen could buy goods and services from foreign countries and have them mailed home to him, and pay no tax to Fed govt.) Therefore from my perspective it's a horribly broken proposal as it stands now.<p>Also any tax scheme which allows the rich to not pay any taxes at all, while still requiring working class to do so, cannot be described as a Fair Tax. If anything the name is an Orwellian mindfuck where the substance is the opposite of the surface.<p>What's good about it is the attempt to drastically simplify the tax code and reduce the amount of government spying on private lives. That goal (assuming that was their actual goal) is noble. The means described, however, are not.",1280955740

And from what I've heard, iStockPhoto has a ridiculous process that you have to go through to get approved...I think they are basically so ""full"" of submitters, if you aren't already in the system it's hard to break in. Maybe focus on that? (Not saying offer terrible pictures from just anyone, just saying that maybe their site has gotten almost too big...maybe there is a glut in the market.)<p>Something else you might consider doing is good integration/importing. For example Flickr has a check-box where you can easily ""offer your photo for sale on Getty images""...while you probably can't get Flickr to add a box for your site right away, use their API to allow new users to easily import some or all of their Flickr photos right into your site for sale.<p>Perhaps also consider offering a mix of high-quality free and paid photos. For example (again using the Flickr API since I am familiar with it to some degree) there are a lot of amazing photos on Flickr that are license Creative Commons, meaning they are free for use in non-commercial works. Maybe go through yourself and find a few hundred really high-quality ones and offer those alongside the paid ones on your site, categorized and tagged.<p>There are definitely opportunities to be had, it's just a question of finding them.",1280955669

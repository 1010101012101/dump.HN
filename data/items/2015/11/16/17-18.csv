Of course, now Eiffel has a community/enterprise model. In any event, I do think that they were pricing them out of the market. Defense contractors, seem to like ada more. The feature that I miss from Eiffel is the Expanded (allocated on stack feature). Even haskell has some #untyped to deal with boxing primitives. I thought that Expanded was a stroke of genius: bringing specification to implementation without the middleman(aka heap).",1447696782

This means that clicking on a Day should re-render two Months at most.<p>The same shouldComponentUpdate optimization could be added to both Calendar and Day, but in this case clicking a Day would always require the Calendar to re-render, and running through 365 shouldComponentUpdate functions (returning false from at least 363 of them) without first limiting by Month would not be ideal.<p>If the state is managed with ImmutableJS or a similar library, shouldComponentUpdate would only have to do a single reference equality check.

ReactJS uses DOM tree diffing and merging, but that can also get you into trouble with the GC (this may be a solved issue, don&#x27;t use ReactJS, so my bad if this isn&#x27;t correct...).<p>Our product, Elevate Web Builder, uses an in-memory element representation with a DOM change management architecture that avoids all of these issues.  However, because of this design, you <i>have</i> to use our product and our framework in order to benefit from it, because it sits as a virtual layer on top of the DOM.<p>What the DOM really needs, but probably won&#x27;t get because there could be some serious side-effects from bad coding, is a set of simple reference-counted beginUpdate/endUpdate methods on each DOM element that isolate that portion of the DOM tree from repaints, but not layouts.  That way, dimensional information is always immediately available, but painting is always handled as a single last step.<p>I&#x27;m meandering here, but the point is that improvements in the DOM management layer of the browsers could drastically cut the necessity of frameworks whose primary purpose is to work around deficiencies in the DOM.  Fix the browsers, and you fix the load time.  Cutting out the frameworks just ends up trading different kinds of pain...",1447696222

Sudoku is mechanically solvable, but not all sudoku puzzles <i>feel</i> that way, to me.<p>Uh, I haven&#x27;t actually done sudoku in a long time, so let me talk about kakuro (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakuro"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakuro</a>) instead. I think the feelings I have about them are similar.<p>So yes, I expect it would be fairly easy to write a backtracking kakuro solver. But the way I solve kakuro is very little like naive backtracking. I do things like - this row can only have numbers two to six, and this column can only have numbers five-plus, so this square is either five or six. But the row can only have one of those numbers, which means <i>this</i> square is two to four, and of those, four is the only number that fits in <i>this</i> column.<p>And getting a computer to implement that sort of algorithm would be challenging. (<a href=""http://www.sudokuhints.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sudokuhints.com/</a> seems to do something like it for sudoku, to let it give you a number and tell you how you could have found that number yourself. But trying a fiendish puzzle, it&#x27;s not explaining itself very well.)<p>(Obviously, if you don&#x27;t enjoy sudoku, that&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;m not trying to convince you that you should. It just feels to me like the skills I use for sudoku, aren&#x27;t ones that I could trivially teach to a computer.)",1447695998

You don&#x27;t use &quot;cost-based pricing&quot; in advertising (i.e., you don&#x27;t decide how much to charge to make sure you are covering your costs of acquisition). You decide how much to spend on a given ad channel based on the average revenue you expect to get from a customer. There may be other important metrics like payback period -- or sometimes even less tangible things like the number of customers may be important if scale is an end in itself -- but in any case, rational people in charge of acquisition are making sure they are getting some benefit out of the ads at the optimal price that was set independently. If you start marking your price up beyond what people are willing to pay just because you want to make some ad channel effective, you&#x27;ll see conversion drop and the channel will become _even more inneffective_.<p>I would argue that two companies with identical products -- one who acquires customers organically and one who acquires customers through advertising -- should set the same price.

This is a highly educated, intelligent, smart person.<p>I was scanning &#x27;scopes on periscope.tv on my laptop PC, and I really liked this one guy&#x27;s scope. It took me a long time to figure out what his Periscope handle was (I had to simultaneously open the Periscope app on my phone, search this guy&#x27;s name, and then click on each of the two people with the same name to figure out which one he was).<p>A couple of days ago, needing a laugh, I took the plunge and downloaded Vine on my phone. To start off, I wanted to see the most popular Vines ever (or in the comedy section). I was sure that would make me laugh. There was apparently no way to watch the top Vines ever, or even in any category. This is obviously a popular need, seeing that YouTube is flooded with compilations of popular Vines. (In fact, instead of losing all their traffic to YouTube, they should consider having a feature that seamlessly stitches Vines together to play them continuously without having to scroll anything.)<p>Twitter&#x27;s complexity to new users is well known. I suspect this complexity is spreading like contagion to its other amazing products.<p>What&#x27;s the solution here? Completely replace the product dev. teams with fresh eyes? Bring in end-users to test product? Bring in a Steve Jobs-like &quot;editor&quot; to &quot;simplify, simplify&quot;?<p>They have 2 clients for the same service (twitter). While that is probably a good thing in certain situations... as of now it seems like unnecessary overlap and a waste of resources.<p>As a heavy consumer of Twitter, and someone who is very intrigued by Periscope and Vine, it has me very concerned that even after identifying a key issue (end-user complexity), they seem to be unable to find a quick-fix.",1447694168

Nobody is going to make the labor compromise when the question is  &quot;Do I feed 10 people or 100 people&quot;.<p>>Any money saved here isn&#x27;t going to some CEO, this is the government, it&#x27;s budgeted and if it doesn&#x27;t go to another project here, it goes to some other service for the American people.<p>Um, do you have any idea about federal funds just languishing in bank accounts?

In the brand of Agile/Scrum that those shops create, it is anything but engineer-friendly, and they absolutely still view engineering and software development as cost centers instead of value centers. In fact, in a lot of cases, Agile is used explicitly because it enforces an aggressive deadline culture in which the sacrifice of quality in favor of short release cycles is explicitly codified into the work culture, and reinforced every day in every team interaction. These situations also foster extreme degrees of &quot;surveillance culture&quot; -- basically since the middle management over top of the so-called cost center of engineering can&#x27;t do much, technologically, to mitigate the realities of creating software value, they opt instead for draconian surveillance and progress tracking environments, like stodgy Jira, and they take things like team burndown literally and draw sweeping conclusions from an extremely small set of burndown data. This all typically goes hand-in-hand with open-plan offices too, where everyone can be literally seen during their work and there is an implicit mandate from the company that your status is partially related to how much you &#x27;look the part&#x27; while in the office. Even if you&#x27;re a developer needing quiet time to creatively solve a problem, and you&#x27;re seated smack in the middle of a loud group of sales associates whose job requires them to be on the phone all day, the business doesn&#x27;t care. Your actual productivity as a developer isn&#x27;t as meaningful to them as your ability to look like a good piece of office furniture most of the time by fitting into their surveillance and micromanagement culture. Typically, promotions and advancement are won in the environments not through technical skill or hard work, but through one&#x27;s ability to sublimate your natural desires for reasonable working conditions and &quot;endure it with a smile&quot; better than peers can, a phenomenon which Michael O. Church referred to as &quot;macho subordination.&quot; In my working experience, at least, this has been precisely how Agile/Scrum are used, whether in a start-up, a finance firm, or a long-standing education tech company.",1447693610

What you see here, taking an already accurate model and generating an approximate implementation, is definitely rare but not unexpected. Long-running simulations can have their run-time drastically compressed simply by developing a neural network capable of being parallelized on GPUs, as in this paper. The ANN run time could be further compressed by generating a single-hidden-layer equivalent. Even though they are known to be exponentially larger than multiple hidden layers, the implementation can be valuable in real-time systems where analysis latency is at a premium, e.g. image recognition in machine control systems.",1447693444

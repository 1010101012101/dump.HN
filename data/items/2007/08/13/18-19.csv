This group, better than any other I've found on the internet, surely understands how little the actual idea of facebook is worth.  <p>Why didn't Zuckerberg's friends make the site themselves?  Maybe because it was easier to not make it, and then demand money from him later especially after facebook became really successful.",1187031346

And of that group, 86.6 percent were over 40, evidence that the next big wave of entrepreneurs may be seasoned workers, not college dropouts in Silicon Valley with a breakthrough technology concept.""

42030,comment,41699,41889,0,0,koolmoe,,,"""I prefer clearly separating my work life and my <i>fun</i> life instead of living for my job""<p>That's likely because your job is not fun.  If you were more invested in it (e.g., it fulfilled your dreams), you might feel differently.<p>Thinking that work doesn't have to be fun is what leads most people to dissatisfaction, IMO.  I think the idea that your job should be a vehicle for fulfillment is a very important one.  Time is scarce resource, and it is a shame that many people are willing to trade the bulk of their lives away helping someone else achieve his dreams rather than trying to achieve their own.<p>It occurs to me that the most liberating and frightening aspect of entrepreneurship is its lack of definition compared to traditional employment.  Consider that a traditional employment relationship leaves the average employee little time for introspection, and it's easy to see that he's been trained to dream small and settle for the scraps of time he hasn't traded to his employer for a relatively small amount of money.",1187030959

There are literally tens of thousands of developers on the Android market -- including many long time denizens -- but one (purportedly) quits and it gets spread far and wide: I've now seen this linked on a number of blogs, news sites, and social news lists.<p>Why? I would argue that it speaks to an audience's bias.<p>I think the most interesting thing about this company is that their games are, by most respects, quite successful on the Android market. A $3.00 game selling more than 50,000 copies. Another selling 100,000+. Another selling 100,000+. Perhaps they got all of their sales during a sale, but their base metrics seem quite good.<p>I can't speak to their situation or frustration, but will make a couple of remarks for prospective Android devs-<p>a) Cut out the crap: Don't desperately try to reach 100% of the Android base because that just sets you up for a world of pain, which I suspect is their core issue. Cut out low-end handsets, with the basest filter being Gingerbread+ at this point.<p>b) There are actually only a handful of GPUs in use across all of the different devices (Adreno, PowerVR, Tegra2/3, Mali). Understand the GPUs, not the handsets.<p>c) If you can't handle the work, which apparently this company couldn't, <i>subcontract</i>. They apparently had a successful product but they couldn't tolerate the work involved.

In the end, there's always the manifest file, so you don't appear on the market for devices which you deem are not worth the time to optimize for. Chris Pruett had a nice talk about various ways to go about it in Google I/O last year[1].<p>While fragmentation is to be expected because of the nature of Android, the revenue issue is one that is completely on Google, and by far the bigger issue. Ease of paying, ways of paying, ways of promoting your app (namely gifting), all of these things are just poor on the platform, and that's why the taste is bitter in the end. Fragmentation is something that developers can work around, while people having no way to pay for apps is completely out of developer's hands.<p>(Not to mention the amount of markets where you can only publish free apps.)<p>End of rant.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdvaPyq_eBU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdvaPyq_eBU</a>",1331465720

3690178,comment,3689383,3690062,3,0,_delirium,,,"On the trivia-questions angle, I do think developers who've been working with a particular set of technology for a while tend to highly value deep knowledge of the particulars of that technology, and under-estimate the competence of someone who doesn't come from <i>exactly</i> the same background. It's not so much that they feel the detail is important, but that it becomes a heuristic of, if you don't know X and call yourself a Y-programmer, you must be incompetent or faking. Which is a tough call to make with all these permutations of experience people could have, and excludes anyone whose technology/stack experience is even slightly different.<p>The traditional example is interviews for C coding jobs, where when developers interview, they gravitate towards standards-lawyering type interview questions. That at least has the advantage of being a fairly stable community, though; being a ""C coder"" has a certain set of cultural assumptions, and it might even be true that if you don't know certain trivia questions, it's a reliable litmus test for whether you're ""really"" a C specialist.",1331465455

In those days, gold was money, and India had a lot of gold.)",1331463883

Garbage collection isn't free either.<p>In this case it would have made sense to go with C++ and allocated as much as possible on the stack. It is cheaper memory wise (because you don't have to keep whatever malloc requires around and because they are removed as soon as you are done with it) and it gives better performance too.<p>For what you can't allocate on the stack, you a smart pointer.<p>There are of course pitfalls here -- smart pointers (via reference counting) can be slower than garbage collection and they have trouble dealing with cycles. You may also have to take special care if they are shared across threads.",1331463840

Where did your dollar go?  We spent about 20% of our total man-hours last year dealing with Android in one way or another - porting, platform specific bug fixes, customer service, etc.[...] We spent thousands on various test hardware.  These are the unsung necessities of offering our apps on Android.  Meanwhile, Android sales amounted to around 5% of our revenue for the year, and continues to shrink.  Needless to say, this ratio is unsustainable.""</i><p>This is a major problem (that actually encompasses several problems often mentioned with Android) that countless developers face, and that will not be addressed anytime soon.",1331463638

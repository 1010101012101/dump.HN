Went to their programming boot camp which was two or three weeks of 14-hour days learning their methodology and (sigh) COBOL.  One of the final assignments was to write the code for a particular set of requirements.  Then desk check it (i.e. on paper) until you were certain it was correct.  Then you saved it and submitted the file.  You got one chance, it had to compile cleanly and pass their suite of tests.<p>Most people passed; it was not a ""gotcha"" problem, you just had to be able to read carefully and pay attention to detail.  Andersen hired a lot of liberal arts majors who had done a lot of writing, I was one of only a few in that group who had done a C.S. curriculum.",1307584622

2635682,comment,2634289,2634502,5,0,keeptrying,,,"_Books for dealing with the emotional stress_<p>Also the following books helped me to get my mind straight about all this:<p>1. The Art of Happiness by HH Dalai Lama and Howard C Cutler\n2. The New Earth - Eckhart Tolle<p>You'll realize that comparing your life the outward projection of other peoples lives is pointless and is mostly useless.<p>Also the most important thing that you'll realize is that suffering is in your mind. And is something you can control.<p>_Books on how to care for Alzheimers patients_<p>Some books I HIGHLY recommend to figure out how to care for your parents and for yourself:<p>1. Alzheimers - Early Stages by Daniel Kuhn\n2. The 36 hour day by Rabins et al.<p>3. The Anti-Alzheimers Prescription by Vincent Fortanasce. (This is not really anti anything but goes through modalities that _could_ reduce alzheimers in the future.)<p>To get an idea of what an alzheimers parent is going through you could read: Alzheimers from the inside out by Richard Taylor.<p>_Dangerous Drugs_<p>Also the 2 drugs that might get prescribed and that you would want to watch out for because of abnormally high rates of deaths in the trails are:\n1. Reminyl(Galantamine)\n2. Donepezil 23mg dosage. (The 10mg dosage doesnt seem to have had any side effects for my dad in the last 2 years).<p>_Personal Situation_<p>My dad has Alzheimers too. Right now he seems to be able to live on his own. We handle all his taxes, medicines, doctors visits etc.<p>My dad's case is made worse by him living in a village in rural India. And he vehemently will not leave. Electricity is only present for about 19 hours a day and water only for 4 hours a day. This makes it much more interesting a problem. :) But he is a pretty amazing guy having gone from a village to an engineering degree and high ranking navy officer so he's a got fighting spirit which I think helps him.<p>(Interestingly theres wireless internet here for 24 hours a day!)<p>_Other Thoughts_<p>I absolutely agree with edw519 - you cant expect any help from anyone but you can ask. You'll be surprised by people who will be willing to help. You have to become part of the community you are in. You dont have to even tell them about your parents until you've known them for a while.<p>Also I think in the US there is a lot of support you can get from local organizations. The Alzheimer's Book number 1 recommendation above lists a lot of helpful resources that could be useful even if your parents dont have alzheimers.<p>_Practical Advice_<p>1. Create a strict regimen for your parents. Something they can do on their own. As edw519 says, use attendants, nurses, adult day care etc.<p>2. Make time for yourself. And use this time to start applying for remote jobs or take on simple work from sites like RentACoder etc.<p>_Bottom Line_<p>You arent missing out on ANYTHING. Every friend of yours will have to deal with aging parents at one point or another. Or worse they've already lost theirs. You are able to get some quality time with these people which I think you are lucky to be able to do.<p>I dont know at what stage your parents are but I aired out all my past grievances with my dad and its made our relationship that much more stronger. I admire him a little bit more now.<p>Dads situation has also brought my whole family closer.<p>_My Contact_<p>You can contact me at railsnoob at yahoo dot com if you like for whatever - just to vent (I always feel like venting after a few days iwth dad :) ...  or talk about our experiences or anything.",1307584551

2635659,comment,2634289,2634289,2,0,jrussbowman,,,"I can sympathize to your frustration. I went through a bout of similar frustration albeit for what you may consider a much more positive situation. I finally came up with my idea for a startup around the same time I started a family and the recession hit.<p>After the birth of my 2nd child in 3 years, I was extremely frustrated because I really wanted to work on my project but my family responsibilities didn't give me enough time.<p>What I finally concluded was I didn't want to be frustrated and I had to prioritize. So I prioritized my family, stopped working on a startup and focused on my idea being a project. Since then I've put maybe 2-3 hours a week into my site, unscatter.com. It's coming along extremely slowly, but I've also been able to focus on more fun parts of the development that I wouldn't have prioritized in the past. Along way, I've come to conclusion that I really like programming, something I gave up on as doing professionally years ago when I went the sysadmin route.<p>More importantly, I've had a ton of fun with my family. My 3 year old girl beat me 2 times in a row in Candy Land tonight and now I just finished reading Hop On Pop for probably the hundredth before putting her to bed. Looking back, I've made the right choice. We're still stuck in a townhouse that we're upside down in and is smaller than we'd like. We're still on the east coast when my wife is chomping at the bit to move back the West Coast so she can get our girls more associated with her culture (she's Native American, her tribe is Haida Gwaii which is a Canadian west coast tribe). However, we're  spending the time with our girls and it shows in their behavior and attitude we're doing the right thing. Forget a startup, I'm helping build the foundation for 2 lives and while money would help it's become obvious that my time really is the better investment.<p>So, how does this equate to your situation? Heck you posted this 7 hours ago so I don't even know if you'll ever read this. But here's my impression based on your post above.<p>You moved back with your family to help take care of your parents who are in their 70's. You'd move, but you'd feel guilty. Look, you've already made the same choice I did, you've decided to put your family first. Obviously you love your parents, are you'd already be gone. So, love them. Cherish all the time you can have with them because you will miss them when they're gone. Forget professional momentum, you can get back on that track later. Or, try to see how you can keep that momentum going now. You can do a startup anywhere, just maybe you need to scale it down a notch.<p>I saw below in the comments your a business guy. Awesome, start a business. Do your own coffee shop. Find something that interests you that you can build a business in within that area. If you have the skills, then you'll accomplish it. If you lack the skills but really have the drive, you'll learn the skills and accomplish it. Failures are learning experiences. First you just need to believe in yourself.",1307583379

2635650,comment,2633341,2634068,5,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>His simplified version of history could be way better than what e.g. an 8 year old might otherwise have access to.</i><p>I've had four different eight-year-olds in my household, while living in two different countries, over the years, and any eight-year-old who is literate can find better information about history than what's in the current Khan Academy videos in any country where there is a public lending library. There is the issue, of course, of some students not having access to libraries, but there is also the issue of some students not having access to the Internet. In the best case, Salman Khan will implement his plan of having subject matter experts who have specialized knowledge of various topics (gained, in part, from their years of using libraries assiduously) produce a broader array of Khan Academy videos, and curious eight-year-olds will go beyond both Khan Academy and their school lessons by seeking out other sources of information on a variety of subjects. That's what I encourage my four children to do. Khan Academy is one of a huge variety of sources we use in homeschooling. In my day, as a pupil in a typical public school, I avidly supplemented my school lessons by reading library books. If Khan Academy is part of encouraging more young learners to be more curious and to seek out a greater variety of sources for their learning, more power to it.",1307583150

2635636,comment,2633341,2633993,1,0,blahblahblah,,,"""2 million unique students are viewing our videos every month by choice""<p>Page hits isn't a very good metric if you're trying to get feedback about what viewers actually thought of the videos.  A lot of people have heard of Khan Academy through the news or may land there via a search engine.  How many of them watch the video all the way through?  How many stick around and watch parts II, III, etc.?  I could be totally wrong about this (please correct me if that is the case), but my suspicion is that YouTube's stats probably aren't sufficiently granular to distinguish between a page visit in which the viewer watches the video in its entirety (suggesting that the video was perceived as worthwhile) and a visit in which the viewer watches for a little while and then bails (indicating that it was not perceived as a valuable experience).  User comments are subject to a great deal of self-selection bias.  Viewers who thought the video was the best thing since sliced bread are way more likely to take the time to login (if already registered) or register and login (if not already a registered YouTuber) than those who thought it was a waste of time.<p>There's also a more fundamentally important question to consider:  Did the viewer actually learn the material or were they simply duped into a false belief in their own competency?  HN regularly features posts about interviewing techniques aimed at sorting out real programmers who can write code proficiently from people who simply possess a false belief that they are programmers.  Sound pedagogical methods require some means of verifying that the student has, in fact, built a valid mental model of the subject matter and, of particular importance in the sciences, is capable of applying their knowledge to reason about novel situations.  How do you know that your students actually understand the material?  Do you have any way of distinguishing between students who have had a previous formal learning experience with the subject matter and are simply looking for a refresher course, students who are concurrently receiving other instruction (the teacher is using Khan Academy as a supplement), and students who have had no prior exposure to the material?",1307582662

It may be a habitual choice for them at this point, maybe it doesn't even occur to them anymore to choose anything different, but it's still a choice that they're making and they're responsible for.  And if the consequence of that choice is that you don't get any reward, not even the faintest warm feeling, from helping them, then I think you shouldn't feel bad about leaving.<p>And they have no <i>friends</i>??  This speaks volumes about what kind of people they are.  Once again this is <i>their choice</i> -- you didn't make them that way!<p>How to extract yourself?  Tell them that you're not cut out to be a caretaker, and you need to live in a different place with a different kind of economy.  They won't understand, or even if they do they won't admit it, it sounds like, but never mind that.  It's a good enough reason and they'll have to accept it.<p>It also sounds like you've done a lot of the needed planning already, so your continued personal presence is not necessarily so important.  If you move somewhere where you can find the kind of work you are cut out for, then maybe you can pay for someone to spend a few hours a day with them.",1307582548

But if you look at the article objectively there are a lot of  opportunities it creates for Khan Academy to be even more impactful than what it is today.<p>You are certainly a great teacher, orator and have the understanding of math and finance. However, one person cannot be good at grasping, understanding and teaching ALL subjects. Thats where you have an opportunity to enlist the best the the brightest teachers from US to create videos for you on subjects they are most passionate about. Why not create a video contest to identify in a democratic way who are these top teachers??<p>Also, just to answer your point about a teacher's ability to put 20 video online rather than writing criticism. The thing is that you have already gained a lot of fame and respect for your work and its a very difficult thing to do. Its unreasonable to expect a teacher to gain the same level of viewership now like you have. Thats why I say that take the interest that you have developed around you to uplift other teachers to bring up education as a 'whole'.<p>Otherwise, Kahn Academy will remain a closet work... Just my two cents...<p>Cheers\nRitu",1307582319

For many, the lectures of a teacher are lost time.  Some students (myself included) have struggled to pay attention, struggled to grasp the material, and struggled to relate.  What I wouldn't give for some of the years back that I let lectures pass me by without any understanding whatsoever.  Being able to go home after class and watch (and re-watch) Khan Academy videos has been instrumental in my learning.<p>That isn't to say (and I don't think Sal would say this either) that Khan Academy is the end-all of the new online education.  Far from it.  But it gives students a new opportunity for easy-to-access lectures, and it gives teachers a new paradigm on the ""classroom experience"".  Check out Sal's TED talk for more on that (<a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/salman_khan_let_s_use_video_to_reinvent_education.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/salman_khan_let_s_use_video_to_rein...</a>).<p>As an MBA student, I was a tutor and mentor for local middle-school students, and for some there was the sense that school and education had passed them by.  They either weren't interested in learning, or their teachers had given up on them, or their family life wasn't currently conducive to learning.  Knowing all the details to Conic Sections, understanding discount rates, or the French Revolution isn't what is crucial for them.  Having a learning experience they can control and interact with is what is most important.  Khan's videos are by definition eternally patient, and will even wait for you to look something up in Google or on Wikipedia before continuing.  There is no shame involved here - only learning.  To criticize Sal Khan is a real shame.  For a society of scholars to do it is absolutely wrong in my eyes.  Good for you Sal, and good luck!",1307581216

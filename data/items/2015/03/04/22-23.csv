So if your option price is $1 and the company IPOs and has a price of $12 when you exercise, you owe taxes on $11 per share (this is a gross oversimplification).

It is a way in which they are acting, an unhealthy coping mechanism and pattern of thinking that colors all their thoughts - but it is not something that they <i>can&#x27;t</i> control or observe at all, only something that they don&#x27;t usually control or observe well enough to avoid causing problems.  There is no clear line between their disorder and their voluntary behavior and their personality, it is one unified whole.<p>Do we hate them for that?  What&#x27;s the use?  Who does that help?<p>Before we started medicalizing these things, we relied on public shaming and ostracism to control them until the person&#x27;s behavior got so out of control they became a danger.  While it&#x27;s a cruel way of doing things that we have <i>wholeheartedly</i> rejected, it was surely at least somewhat effective, because of this voluntary component, because telling yourself &quot;Keep it together&quot; is not a 0% effective treatment technique. The country did not suffer from a 26% mental illness rate in times past, and I think it&#x27;s foolish to assume this represents pure underreporting.  Mental illness at least partially conforms to the outlines of the society which defines it - immigrants to the US find themselves substantially healthier than the US on arrival, but develop statistically average rates of US mental illness over time;  Symptoms shift from whatever is recognized in their home country to symptoms more in line with US-recognized disorders.<p>We have decided, rightly or wrongly, that classifying these things according to an insurance-industry handbook, and doling out pills like candy, and pretending these people have no control whatsoever over their disorder in order to relieve them of social responsibility for it, is the correct approach. While the truth is more complex, I tend to find this more humane than some other national attitudes towards the topic, and I have no better approach to offer.<p>Edit: The problem is, when you acknowledge that these things are maladaptive and problematic behaviors that someone presently does not control well, rather than some kind of seizure that completely robs one of consciousness...  you get people popping up who want to go back to the boolean definition again and deny there&#x27;s any problem whatsoever, claim that they&#x27;re doing this for attention and faking it and horrible hoaxers who are sucking the precious fluids from our society... There may be too many douchebags out there for a nuanced view to prevail.  I see this post already has one, <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9147386"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9147386</a> . The problem is the boolean: A 100% controlled premeditated affectation must represent a malicious manipulator, the theory goes, while a 0% controlled mental illness strikes a victim, all victims, like a bus hitting an innocent pedestrian.  But the mind isn&#x27;t so simple, and the onus of personal responsibility is not a cure-all.",1425509282

How is it even possible to do 100mph and why should that speed be allowed? Cars should top off at 75.<p>Why is it even possible? Because a car that can&#x27;t do 100mph is going to have terrible performance 0-75<p>There&#x27;s long stretches of highways in rural areas with speed limits higher than 75<p>>Not to mention, why are cars dumb machines? If someone is going crazy fast in an area where there is no safe way to decelerate, then the car should not allow that speed to be reached.<p>There are sometimes legitimate reasons to be going quickly. I have, at times, needed to have bursts of speed into the 90s to safely get around a drunk driver going 70.<p>You&#x27;re now asking for cars to behave unpredictably based on their determination of the road conditions.<p>And you set the limiter to 75. Now someone is driving 75 in a 25.<p>Most highway deaths are rural[1] and involve a single car - they veer off of narrow lanes into a ditch or trees, or hit a large animal. The difference in reaction time needed to avoid said animals or other obstructions is not that different from 75mph to 90mph - low visibility is the underlying problem there, not speed.<p>The idea that we&#x27;re suddenly safer on roads if we limit speeds is also not necessarily true.<p>In 2013, German autobahns accounted for 31% of the countries traffic, yet only 13% of the deaths. They had a rate of 1.9 deaths per billion kilometers travelled, while urban roads had 4.7, and rural roads 6.6.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s really evidence to support the idea that limiting our cars to lower speeds will be beneficial.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2009/11/29/120716625/the-deadliest-roads-are-rural"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/2009/11/29/120716625/the-deadliest-roads-...</a>",1425508938

Yes, it&#x27;s horrible when a drink driver kills a child, etc, but the risk of that happening per DUI incident is not actually very high.<p>I&#x27;m not from the US, but over here (Finland), drink drivers are generally most dangerous to themselves. Of course there are some innocent people who are killed and injured by drink drivers, and these cases are particular tragedies, but most deaths resulting from drink driving are either people who kill themselves by stupidity, or at least consent to be in a vehicle where the driver is DUI.<p>Another thing I could bring up from analysis of traffic deaths is the large number of suicides we have  -- about 20 % of traffic deaths; this is becoming a burden on truck drivers because they carry a lot of the emotional burden when someone decide to smash their car at high speed to an oncoming truck.<p>And yet another astonishing factor is deaths of &quot;natural causes&quot; (heart attack, stroke etc) while driving. These make up something around 10-15 % of traffic deaths here.",1425508212

Something that is big enough to be well-known, heavily used by a large enough number of users that it brings a lot of stress, but is not big enough (by some definition of &quot;big&quot; and &quot;enough&quot;) to support a team to make it all go smoothly.<p>I&#x27;ve been in that same boat most of my professional career, and in fact I&#x27;m about 16 years into my journey working with the same project (Webmin; which started out with me having a company that used it in products and then ended up with me pivoting and starting a new company based around it); I&#x27;m lucky enough to not be the primary developer, and I&#x27;m lucky enough to have always had just enough money to keep an extra support person on staff and occasionally pay to make some problems go away (translations now and then, accessibility testing, UI and design assets, etc.), but having some huge number of people expecting things to always Just Work, and never have security problems, and never be confusing, and always get better but also never change in any way that might effect the way they use it, is a definite source of stress that I don&#x27;t think people working in large companies will ever experience (though they experience their own sorts of stress and I don&#x27;t think I would trade, even for much better pay).<p>I&#x27;ve had to step back a few times over the years, in more subtle ways than this. And, I&#x27;ve spent time on other projects and other jobs (either to make money or just to have something else to think about and to play with new languages and tools). But, it&#x27;s strange to look back on so many years of doing roughly the same thing.<p>It&#x27;s also odd to think of things that have been so clearly defined by their founder no longer being operated by their founder. This is, I guess, kinda like Rob stepping down from Slashdot a few years back. Turned out not to really effect Slashdot all that much (though I don&#x27;t know how relevant Slashdot remains today, since I so rarely visit); I wonder if Metafilter has the team to keep it spinning...it&#x27;s also a site I haven&#x27;t spent much time at in recent years.",1425508190

You mention that people are &quot;excluded&quot; from rights and privileges, but the problem with the globalist view you espouse is that by lumping in a nation and it&#x27;s people with the world you remove the political lines in a meaningful form.<p>National Sovereignty is the real issue at hand here, but it&#x27;s a sensitive subject that not very many people like to touch. I&#x27;ve heard some fairly powerful beltway people reference it as dead, but if that&#x27;s true our entire government is operating under a fallacy, there are some big implications here and I would love to see more academic research (as in, if anyone has any links I would appreciate them) on the subject.<p>I do think the lessons of the internet are important here though, namely that if you try to claim no nationality, peoples nationality becomes Earth, and a global government along with it. I want to go the opposite direction, less federal power, more state power, more local power (constitutionally restricted of course).<p>The only oath I ever swore was to protect and defend the Constitution, and I&#x27;ll be damned if I&#x27;m going to sit back and watch America be Europeanized without an intellectual fight, because my forefathers fought hard to establish the freedoms I have here that still don&#x27;t exist anywhere else in the world.<p>Yes I&#x27;m aware of the other countries higher levels of &quot;actual&quot; freedom, particularly the nordic ones, but I think our idealistic vision is still a superior one. For example, Vincent Reynouard of France was recently sentenced to two years in jail for his non-violent historical opinions regarding the Holocaust. I tend to side with Voltaire on free speech, apparently the French don&#x27;t.<p>These same issues are also readily apparent in the TPP. I think it is a good microcosm of the kind of affect on nations you will get with a reduction of nationalism, eg, equally exploited populace by a supranational oligarchy.",1425508173

BUT China&#x27;s export sector has always been more dependent on foreign investment, foreign management and external inputs. Even the height of it&#x27;s manufacturing boom, China could run a trade deficit because its export sector was so oriented to labor-intensive final assembly activity. 
The real estate sector is well know for its ungoldly distortedness, it&#x27;s science establishment is riddled with fraud, it&#x27;s economic statistics are generally falsified. The pollution produced by it&#x27;s industry (and corrupt state) is now making a true deadly impact on its society but the pollution is also a product of its energy sector&#x27;s costs being falsified and so-forth.",1440475183

10114520,comment,10114158,10114158,0,0,adventured,,,"The Chinese economy isn&#x27;t doing ok.<p>- Imports and exports have been crashing lower. [1]<p>- They&#x27;ve spent decades lying about their unemployment rate, leaving it mostly unchanged around 4.x% perpetually. [2] It&#x27;s likely far higher, some good estimates peg it around 2 to 2.5 times higher.<p>- They&#x27;ve rapidly become one of the most indebted nations. Most of that occurred in just seven or eight years, taking on debt of epic proportions in record time. They took their total debt to GDP ratio from around 158% in 2007 to over 300% today. [3] [4] [5]<p>- They have perhaps 500 million people living on ~$3 per day. Most of those people are poor farmers, not allowed to own the farm land they work on. In any mid-tier or above economy, about 400+ million of those people would be unemployed, because farming productivity would be vastly higher. Instead, in China farming productivity is held artificially low, because those people would have nothing to do otherwise. South Korean farmers are upwards of 40 times more productive than Chinese farmers. [6]<p>- Since the great recession when China&#x27;s boom ended, they&#x27;ve turned to stimulus programs and debt to fake growth, and have inflated at least two major asset bubbles, in real estate and equities. Both of which are now falling. The article notes that if you had bought stocks a year ago, you&#x27;d still be up nicely - I&#x27;ve noticed articles keep saying that as the market keeps falling, pretty soon it&#x27;ll no longer be true. Then what?<p>- They had to aggressively devalue their currency, as a next to last ditch effort to shore up falling exports, and tumbling competitiveness.<p>- Return on invested capital domestically has been falling for years. As has the return on debt.<p>- Capital is rapidly fleeing China, to the tune of roughly 3/4 of a trillion dollars in the prior year. [7]<p>- China has begun eating their foreign reserves, consuming upwards of $300 billion over the last 12 to 14 months. [8] They have significant reserves of course, however only half of those are accessible without causing serious consequences for the global economy and their biggest customers.<p>- China may have vaporized $6.8 trillion on worthless investments. [9] The estimates could be off by a lot and it would still be a massive sum.<p>- China has spent hundreds of billions of dollars trying to prop up their stock market bubble. The fall of that bubble, and the fall of their real estate bubble, will wipe out perhaps $10 plus trillion of assets. That removes a lot of assets that are needed to help offset their huge debt burden.<p>- China no longer has a significant advantage in manufacturing costs. Countries such as the US, Mexico and Vietnam are increasingly competitive versus China in manufacturing.<p>- Container rates for Asia and China are crashing, indicating deep economic problems. [10]<p>- Core industries like steel are falling hard. [11] [12]<p>This list just keeps going.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/chinas-imports-hitting-record-lows-2015-8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/chinas-imports-hitting-record...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2015/08/unemployment-china"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2015/08/unemploy...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-15/china-s-debt-to-gdp-ratio-just-climbed-to-a-new-record-high"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-15/china-s-de...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-debt-bombs-1435512036"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-debt-bombs-1435512036</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/business-26225205"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.com/news/business-26225205</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-farmer-productivity-2012-8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-farmer-productivity-2...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials/072715-763627-china-economy-will-not-return-to-10-percent-plus-growth.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials/072715-763627-china...</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-18/china-reserves-seen-dropping-40-billion-a-month-on-yuan-support"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-18/china-rese...</a><p>[9] <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2014/11/27/china-has-wasted-68-trillion-in-investment-warn-beijing-researchers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnbc.com/2014/11/27/china-has-wasted-68-trillion-...</a><p>[10] <a href=""http://gcaptain.com/asia-europe-container-freight-rates-have-fallen-off-a-cliff/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gcaptain.com/asia-europe-container-freight-rates-have...</a><p>[11] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-11/china-steel-output-falls-as-low-prices-weigh-on-mill-profits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-11/china-stee...</a><p>[12] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-09/china-steel-flood-deepens-cutting-earnings-fanning-trade-rows"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-09/china-stee...</a>",1440474918

Lessons I&#x27;ve learned are:<p>1. Design with your factory. Finding a good supplier is important but the real work starts once you&#x27;ve shaken hands. Your factory is your greatest resource as a presumably inexperienced hardware designer. It&#x27;s like having an expert-level consultant work on your project for free, so take advantage of it.<p>2. Keep it extremely simple. MVP applies here. Your project will probably fail if it does not have the absolute minimum viable number of hardware features. The majority of your effort should be spent thinking about how to simplify your designs. Avoid moving parts if possible, and design parts that can be produced with simple tooling.<p>3. Your margins should be higher than you think. Think long and hard about your pricing before you launch your Kickstarter. Chances are, your MSRP is optimistically low. Bringing a hardware product to market involves lots of expensive rabbit holes. High margins will save you from death.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rideye/rideye-the-black-box-camera-for-your-bike"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rideye/rideye-the-black...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/voltus/voltus-mobile-power-expansion-for-your-macbook"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/voltus/voltus-mobile-po...</a>",1440474839

If someone in power has a conflict of interest, then the law should be rewritten to resolve it. Typically, the US seems to do it by introducing an adversary of some kind. (ie: The NYPD are considered &#x27;corrupt&#x27; behind the &#x27;Blue Wall of Silence&#x27;. So an adversary has been introduced: the Civilian Complaint Review Board. The Civilian Complaint Review Board not only reviews complaints, but has been granted judicial power to subpoena individual officers and force them to testify before court)<p>In fact, our very constitution was designed around this principle.<p>* The President enforces laws, but is not allowed to write the laws.<p>* The Congress writes the laws, but cannot enforce the law. Congress is further divided into two different houses (Senate and House) with differing responsibilities, as writing the law is considered the most powerful position of this country. Only when both chambers agree do laws move forward.<p>* When questions of enforcement come into play, the Judicial branch resolves it by interpreting the laws.<p>-------<p>Unfortunately, large swaths of red tape and political theory dance is expensive. So even the Federal Government cuts corners sometimes... but even more so with local governments.<p>When some country town can only afford one Sheriff for their entire police department (which is a <i>huge</i> chunk of the country btw), I&#x27;m gonna bet you that the town won&#x27;t be able to afford a &quot;Civilian Complaint Review Board&quot; like New York City can.<p>A good example is St. Louis County / Ferguson right now. Their Police Department has been shown to be incompetent at best. But they can&#x27;t even afford Police Cameras! They tried to buy cameras this past year, and the only way they were able to afford cameras was through funds seized from the populace (either traffic fines or other sources...). Such a source of money isn&#x27;t enough to handle the ongoing storage costs of police cameras. (To say nothing about the conflicts of interest involved in a Police Force with guns who rely on parking tickets, fines, and court fees to fund key parts of their department...)<p>So Ferguson / St. Louis County will remain in the dark, without police cameras... at least until that city / county can afford them.<p>Still... Ferguson and St. Louis County are learning. They are probably going to implement civilian review boards soon. <a href=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/ferguson-st-louis-contemplate-police-review-boards/article_120d0eb4-ba38-5d9a-b05f-56e483566e76.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/ferguso...</a><p>But for a county that can&#x27;t even afford police cameras properly, I bet you that the rollout of this new agency will be slow at best.",1440474581

There are lots of things to know about, and many people simply won&#x27;t ever know about them by pure chance. I believe the law should actually be maximally protective of individuals up to the point it starts severely compromising the flexibility of businesses or individuals. Doing any less is masochism in my opinion.<p>For example, roads have guard rails in high traffic areas that mostly protect people from their stupidity -- you shouldn&#x27;t speed near ledges otherwise; doing so would be stupid, and from then you could be small distraction away from death. It frees mental bandwidth and cuts transit times of travelers with little added cost. Nobody should have to suffer needlessly for poor decisions (not even taking into account most times it&#x27;s just bad luck -- let&#x27;s assume worst case it&#x27;s just stupidity) if we can prevent it, and sometimes education won&#x27;t work (not as fast as it should).<p>I&#x27;ve been stupid quite a few times with regards to physical/career risks myself and have a few otherwise very bright friends make stupid decisions. If those were preventable they should be prevented.

They are taking advantage of flawed student aid policy by using the students to take money from the government.<p>None of these things have happened in any other wealthy country, even though those countries have also seen the same shift in the job market that the United States has.

Also, many segments of society often express pride in the breadth and depth of U.S. legal protections for free expression, and argue that it&#x27;s something that makes the U.S. or the U.S. legal system great.<p>Foreign law students sometimes find it hard to believe that some of the rules are so protective of speech (source: three different U.S. law professors have told me this).<p>A few examples:<p>* All fictional depictions of violence are protected.<p>* There are no restrictions on blasphemy or insults to religious doctrines, religious beliefs, religious believers or communities, or religious believers&#x27; feelings.<p>* Advocacy and glorification of any kind of illegal action (including war crimes and genocide) are fully protected if they aren&#x27;t reasonably likely to lead to a specific imminent lawless action.<p>* Advocacy against the state or its powers is mostly completely protected for citizens, as is teaching that the prevailing political or economic system is inherently wrong. Urging resistance to or evasion of military conscription is mostly understood as protected now (unlike during World War I). Same thing with taxation, if you&#x27;re not teaching people how to do it with the intention that they act on your advice.<p>* Detailed information about how to commit crimes is usually protected if the person publishing it didn&#x27;t have a sufficiently specific intention to help people actually commit them in practice and didn&#x27;t have some other responsibility to keep the published information secret.<p>* Insulting present or past state leaders or the virtue or legitimacy of the state or any political party is fully protected.<p>* It&#x27;s protected to advocate regional or ethnic secession or territorial separatism (though not to conspire to effectuate it by force). It&#x27;s protected to display flags or emblems of militant groups, even those that the U.S. is trying to oppose or suppress or is engaged in armed conflict with. It&#x27;s protected to show disrespect to national symbols or emblems of the United States.<p>* Contrary to increasingly common popular belief, there are no restrictions on &quot;hate speech&quot; or group libel (for example saying that a particular group in society is bad, using slurs against a group, saying that some negative stereotype is true or that members of some group commonly or always have a negative characteristic, or wishing for or justifying ill treatment of a group).<p>* Most sexualized depictions of adults (and most sexualized depictions of fictional children) are now legally protected in practice, although there can theoretically be restrictions in various circumstances that seem to be becoming increasingly rare and exceptional.<p>* It&#x27;s hard to punish people for downstream republication of leaked or misappropriated information.<p>* It&#x27;s hard to punish people for repeating truthful negative information about other people, especially if they weren&#x27;t originally involved in obtaining that information.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are other examples!",1440474346

I don&#x27;t do oly lifts, but on occasion do power cleans to get into position to do overhead presses without a rack. That tends to terrify people around me too<p>Power clean is similar to the first part of the clean and jerk (where he pulls the bar explosively upwards and catches it), but in power clean you drive the bar further up into a near jump, and catch the bar much higher up (in a clean you drop down pretty much in squat position when catching).<p>In clean type movements you can generally fail by pushing yourself and the bar apart so the bar crashes to the floor. Similarly when putting a bar overhead - your main priority is to ensure the bar clears your head, and frankly that&#x27;s not all that hard as no matter what grip you use, making the bar clear your hands is likely to get it mostly clear of your head.<p>My scariest experience - once in 10 years of doing power cleans into press position to do my overhead presses - was on a 1RM attempt where I started feeling dizzy halfway into my press, and felt I had to ditch the bar. Even then, worrying I&#x27;d faint, it took just a little nudge to get the bar far enough out from me to crash to the ground without touching me. Only caveat was that my fingers didn&#x27;t clear totally, so I was pulled down after it and ended up dazed and confused on floor, hands still on the bar, but unhurt other than some slight bruises.<p>I&#x27;ve failed to complete part of the movement (usually the press at the end - you can usually power clean much more than you&#x27;ll be able to overhead press) many times, but usually you&#x27;ll know when it&#x27;s not going to work and can maintain enough rigidity to put the bar down in a controlled way.",1440474097

Yes, one of the most important things is to find THE right partner in China, as that can easily make or break your product.<p>However, if you&#x27;re afraid to build your own hardware (or at least drastically modify something pre-existent), you&#x27;re severely limiting your flexibility and the areas where you can innovate. Maybe it worked well for Koalasafe, which sounds like could have very well be built as just a modified version of OpenWRT with a simple installer. But it certainly wouldn&#x27;t work for more than half of the other hardware projects out there.
Look at the most succesful projects - Pebble, Coolest Cooler, The Micro, Dash - none of these could have gotten where they are without custom firmware.<p>Going back to KoalaSafe - the $100k they raised may sound like a lot of money, but it&#x27;s certainly not enough to develop the kind of hardware they are using. It&#x27;s enough maybe for the software part and some prototypes. You have to set your expectations straight too, and I do believe they did the best anyone could do with that money.

- a 0.99 cents novelty app
- 1 month dev time
- 3 months wait for approval
- sold about 1500 copies to date
- received about $300 from Apple (more on the way)
- sales are down to about 10 copies / day<p>Second App
- simple, innovative 0.99 cents game that wasn't polished
- 1.5 months dev time
- 2 days wait for approval
- sold about 150 copies in the first few days
- received small amount of money from Apple
- sales immediately dropped to < 1 copy / day after the first week
- app removed from store 3 weeks after release<p>Third app
- super-simple free noise making app a la sound grenade, ifart etc
- 5 hours dev time
- 1 week wait for approval
- 250 downloads the first day (today is the second day)
- no money yet... an ad-supported version is awaiting approval into app store",1235365078

491273,comment,490712,490712,0,0,vaksel,,,"I think additional part of the problem is that men are starting to realize that they really don't have anything to gain by being married. And they are so afraid of having to go through a divorce that can wipe them out, that they don't feel like trying. I mean a 50% divorce rate in this country, is pretty much a coin toss on whether or not you lose everything.<p>Seriously the only thing to gain by being married is saving a few bucks on taxes.<p>And you lose pretty much everything else. Every single married guy I know is MISERABLE. The sex pretty much stops within the first couple of years. And the woman gains mega weight, because now that they ""got"" you, they don't need to keep in shape. And then the whole bitchy wife comes out treating the guy as a second class citizen.<p>Marrying an American woman is pretty much the worst decision you can make. If you really want to get married, go find a nice European girl to marry, unlike American women, at least they know that marriage is not a one way street.",1235364345

advice for starting a startup down to around 10 
sentences, what are they?  It's the nature of compression that everything in the compressed version is in the original.<p>Even so there were several things that seemed new to me.  Let me check.<p>I never quite realized till now that a version 1.0 was (or could be) nothing more than a pretext.<p>The rectangle metaphor and the point about one side being easier to change is new; I only thought of that a couple weeks ago.<p>The greater difficulty of lying to yourself when expanding userwise is something I don't think I've written about.<p>I don't think I've mentioned that founders' own standards for customer service are artificially low, or that customer service is mostly a way of studying users.<p>I don't think I realized before that being cheap was interchangeable with iterating, or mentioned that a culture of cheapness keeps companies young.<p>I don't think I've written about how paying distractions are so much worse than other kinds, or that it's specifically because they work like interrupts.<p>I didn't realize till recently that the right metaphor for a deal was a background process.<p>And I definitely didn't realize till I'd actually written out the list which would be the most important one, or that it was involved in half the others.<p>Not <i>that</i> bad for an essay only 2.5 pages long.",1235364153

The thing to keep in mind is that this works against men as well as women, it just hits them at different points in their lives.<p>If women between the ages of 21 and 25 are interested in (and pursued by) men between the ages of 21 and 35+, while men between 21 and 25 are limited to women who are roughly the same age, then men will face a very difficult dating ""market"" in their early 20s, and women will experience a favorable one.  As men and women age, the inevitable symmetry switches the situation - women between 35 and 40 are now competing for men who are pursuing women between the ages of, say, 25 and 40.<p>This is something to keep in mind when you hear that the dating world is unfair to women over 35.  It's ""unfair"" to men too, just earlier in life.",1235363756

491265,comment,491196,491196,0,0,cperciva,,,"I have check marks next to 8 of these, and I'm working on a 9th (ironically, #9 -- ""Get ramen profitable""); but I've broken 4 of these rules, and I don't regret it in the slightest.<p>Rule #1 -- Pick good cofounders.  I picked no cofounders, based largely on the fact that that I couldn't think of anyone who would be interested in joining me who wouldn't dramatically lower the average founder quality.  (Ok, that's being a bit facetious -- but I'm working in an area where domain knowledge is extremely important, so there are lots of wonderfully talented people who would be utterly useless to me as cofounders.)<p>Rule #2 -- Launch fast; and Rule #3 -- Let your idea evolve.  I started working on tarsnap in September 2006, and I didn't open tarsnap to the public until November 2008.  Over that time I ironed out some technical details behind the scenes, but the largest change in my idea was going from planning to charge $0.25/GB to actually charging $0.30/GB.  Since then, I've listened to my users and occasionally added an unplanned-for feature because of a request (or more often, several requests for the same thing from different people); but most of the ways that tarsnap has deviated from my original plan have simply been in the ordering of when I implemented which features.  The vision behind tarsnap, from 2.5 years ago -- an online snapshotted backup service with a tar front-end, a heavy emphasis on security, and a linear pricing model -- hasn't changed at all.<p>Rule #10 -- Avoid distractions.  I've remained as FreeBSD Security Officer while working on tarsnap, and I don't regret it in the slightest.  Yes, it has taken time away from tarsnap on occasion; however, it has also allowed me to further enhance my domain knowledge, and has brought many people to tarsnap (one person recently described tarsnap as being a backup system with ""a good pedigree"", which I'm presuming refers to my open source security background).<p>Now, for all that I've broken these rules without regrets, I still think that they're good rules -- in most cases.  But I think there should be a Rule #0: Realize that there are always exceptions, and understand why these rules are usually correct instead of applying them blindly.",1235363567
491264,story,,,13,13,SingAlong,"Ask HN: When to approach the press for coverage?",,"Ask HN: When to approach the press for coverage?<p>We run an local SMS service and have just around 100 users. It's been just a week since the launch.<p>Last week during the Yahoo Hackday I met a press reporter for a local newspaper when she was passing by the Hackday hall and I explained to her about the service (then it was barely new  just 2 days after launch). She listened to me for about 15 minutes. She then gave me her card and asked me to contact her when I needed help with the media.<p>Couple other well known SMS services have shut-down in the previous 3-4 months (one shutdown and the other has been blocked by two major cellphone operators). There are now only 2 that exist currently in my geopraphical area, of which we are one and the usage cost of the other competitor is more.<p>Now my first thought is to approach for media coverage only after a while (with maybe atleast 1000 regular users). But I think word-of-mouth isn't just enough for this to pull off successfully.<p>Should I approach the local media now or later? If yes, how? What data should I provide them with? (I mean, should I be open about the number of users I have and sms traffic etc)<p>We have an online webpage incase you want to know about the service. The service is available for the state of Karnataka (includes Bangalore) in India. http://www.shoutjamit.com<p>Thanks to swombat, spydez and wheels (HN) for helping with refining the idea.<p>P.S: The reporter whom I spoke to, works for a newspaper who's audience is mostly teens and college goers (my target audience)",1235363462

What are the possible reasons for why you would have multiple providers as opposed to just pumping everything through one?<p>Is it:<p>1) A provider might not have enough bandwidth available for your needs, so you need to diversify?<p>2) You would get multiple providers so that you try to reach as many destinations as possible directly? IOW, if I only have ATT, then in order to get to destination X that's on Level3 there's an extra hop wherever the hell ATT connects to Level3, and you also have Level3 yourself then the fastest route to that is through the Level3 network?<p>3) All/None of the above/something else?",1235362975

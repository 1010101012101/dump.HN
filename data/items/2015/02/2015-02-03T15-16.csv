8991018,comment,8985496,8988361,0,0,kllrnohj,,,"> In general I find a good way to approximate a top-of the line NVIDIA GPU is to think of it as an ~8 core with a vector length of 192 for single precision and 96 (half of full length) for double precision.<p>But that&#x27;s not entirely correct either. Yes you <i>can</i> use it like that, but you can also use it as a single core with a vector length of 1536.<p>In the context of over-simplification these are better thought of as single-core processors. The reason being if you have method foo() that you need to run 10,0000 times, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you use 1 thread, 2 threads, or 8 threads - the total time it will take to complete the work will be identical. This is very different from an 8-core CPU where using 8 threads will be 8x faster than using 1 thread (blah blah won&#x27;t be perfectly linear etc, etc).",1422978860

Civic-minded hackers, non-profits, and startups went from being outsiders to permeating agencies. Much was organic, and some was top-down mandated. Obama saw what happened in 2 elections and these new agencies are peppered with the people that used agile tech to great advantage on the campaign. Agencies like HHS and FCC were pioneers in open data -- not just for government, but for anyone. Look at cfpb.gov - an example of what an agency can look like when it starts from scratch. 18F and USDS are now tasked with bringing that innovation to the rest of government.

Apple is hugely successful, no question, with their success riding largely on four factors: 1) industrial design, 2) idiot-proof OS, 3) zero hardware diversity, 4) 3rd party developer support.  Google is hugely successful, too, but they have no mission statement that says they are intending to squeeze every last penny from the mobile market.  I mean seriously, the last number I heard was that there were close to 1500 people working on Chrome-related stuff.  The fact is that Google makes &quot;small&quot; (hundreds of millions to a few billion) amounts on a broad variety of things, and underwrites the spectrum of R&D/engineering via their advertising juggernaut.

My main concern about Mongo is actually one that is addressed by this release so I&#x27;m quite excited to try it out - data compression. Mongo is generally quite irresponsible about disk space usage.

Stroke claimed 128,932 US lives. Diabetes took 73,831 american lives. Suicide robbed 39,518 people their life last year -- in excess of 7,000 more than died by automobile related accidents.<p>In 2009, approximately a grand total of 2,436,652 died in the US of all causes (including natural causes). Of that number, automobile related deaths only accounts for 1%. Of the entire US population, we&#x27;re talking about 0.0096%...<p>According to the CDC, in 2012, 10,322 people (or 31%) of all automobile related deaths were alcohol-related deaths. Another 18% of automobile related deaths are attributed to drugs other than alcohol in the same year. That accounts for just about 50% of all vehicle related deaths, leaving the true automobile related deaths due to accident at a shockingly low number (relatively) of about 15,000 people per year.<p>All of this is to say, relatively speaking, automobile related deaths are not a significant concern anymore. It does not make logical nor financial sense to do anything significant in this sector while ignoring or not increasing efforts in these other much more significant areas.<p>So, to counter your original assertion -- no, it&#x27;s not &quot;completely fucking insane&quot;... the amount of people dying from the common Flu is.<p>Sources:<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/01/09/guns-traffic-deaths-rates/1784595/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/01/09/guns-tr...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/top-causes-of-death-united-states-2011-11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/top-causes-of-death-united-st...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/t/general-statistics/fatalityfacts/state-by-state-overview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/t/general-statistics/fatalit...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/Motorvehiclesafety/impaired_driving/impaired-drv_factsheet.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/Motorvehiclesafety/impaired_driving/impai...</a>",1422978522

Notably, this applies to <i>all</i> patent suits, whether or not you&#x27;re right, even if you&#x27;re the person being sued, rather than you vice versa.<p>In effect, Facebook can revoke the patent grant at will just by bringing an onerous patent lawsuit - you can either agree to their arbitrary terms (e.g. never to use React again and pay X billion), or you can argue their patent rights are invalid or unenforcable and lose the patent grant.  That onerous suit might be over the very patents this grant licenses; it really doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>At best, this is a promise not to consider past patent infringement, since you&#x27;ll receive warning that your license to React patents revoked.<p>The fact that suing over usage of OSS would damage their reputation is irrelevant: even without a patent grant it would be perceived as extremely untrustworthy to sue over submarine patents.  The patent grant doesn&#x27;t really change that (it might make the commentary even more snarky should such an event occur, but that&#x27;s about all).  Also, realize that if this ever does occur, it&#x27;s unlikely to be in a world that looks at Facebook like it does today.  This is typically something you&#x27;d expect of a company in decline: they&#x27;re not after good PR at that point, but after extracting maximal rents from others.  And of course it wouldn&#x27;t need to be Facebook itself that filed the lawsuits; they might sell off that intellectual property to some patent troll and claim (somewhat reasonably, I might add) that it&#x27;s not really their responsibility what happens later on.  Actual events have repeatedly shown that large firms have no qualms in making somewhat shady IP deals if that can give them a competitive advantage (e.g. the lawsuits surrounding android). In short: I don&#x27;t think bad PR is a very effective disincentive for a patent lawsuit.",1422976602

- Bedouin/Saharan peoples are probably a good reference. They had/have cisterns throughout the desert to preserve water between rainfalls. I think they were largely nomadic but I don&#x27;t know the motivation for that (trade vs food supply vs ?)

8990692,comment,8986920,8986920,0,0,moron4hire,,,"I first learned about this issue while working on Primrose.<p>Things get really hairy in the browser when you start talking about JavaScript, the keyboard, and international support.<p>For example, there is no way to know what keyboard layout a user is using. With Primrose, I guess based on the user&#x27;s default language, but even that isn&#x27;t perfect as a lot of not-US English speakers just show up as &quot;en&quot;, with no further locale description, so I also provide a select list with all of the available choices.<p>It&#x27;s very difficult to know with certainty what <i>character</i> a user is intending to type. KeyCode 51 with no modifier keys is &quot;3&quot; on most keyboards, except French, where it is &quot;#&quot; (they essentially swap the casing of the number row).<p>The number pad numbers send different keycodes than the number row numbers, but the number pad arrows (if you turn off the numlock) send the same keycodes as the arrow keys.<p>In languages with deadkey support for diacritics (such as French and German), the deadkey keyCode isn&#x27;t sent until the second key is typed. Then, they are sent in rapid succession.<p>There is absolutely no way to know what is going on with IMEs.<p>And there is no reliable way to interact with the soft keyboard on mobile devices. Some versions of soft keyboards don&#x27;t send the arrow key keyCodes. There is no standardization of what keys should be available, so you can&#x27;t guarantee that your user will easily be able to type your shortcuts (I know of only one keyboard on Android that even has CTRL or ALT). And it&#x27;s nearly impossible to know how much space the soft keyboard is going to take up on the screen (you can figure it out on Android, eventually. It&#x27;s impossible on iOS.).<p>So, you have one of two choices, if you&#x27;re trying to implement any sort of browser-based application that involves heavy use of the keyboard.<p>Option 1: You can either create a hidden, surrogate text area in which the user actually types, unbeknownst to them, and run a sync process between the content they type and the content you display. This has several problems: you have to wait for keyUp to activate shortcut commands. The sync process can be costly (especially in the context for which Primrose exists: WebVR) and it is difficult to keep the cursor view in sync when dealing with mouse/touch interactions. Oh, speaking of pointer actions, you have to make sure your surrogate text area is positioned exactly under the displayed text field, with the text appearing the same apparent size as the displayed text, because when it gains focus the browser will scroll the view to it.<p>But it will work, except for certain use cases. It won&#x27;t work well on mobile, and it won&#x27;t play nicely with WebVR (which is the entire point of Primrose, anyway), especially for Asian users using an IME.<p>So Option 1 isn&#x27;t a good option.<p>Option 2: completely reimplement the key input stack, i.e. create all the keyboards and soft keyboards and IMEs your users will ever need. Completely ignore what the OS and the browser tell you, take only the raw keyCodes, and reconstruct what is happening. It&#x27;s a lot of work, a lot to debug, but at least there is a path to actually solve every problem.",1422976056

Many comp sci students are brainwashed to think that if a salary isn&#x27;t at least 100k then it&#x27;s not worth their time.<p>The fact is that it depends on location and cost of living.<p>For example - if you get hired to work for Google in their HQ in CA then you are guaranteed to get at least 100k salary. However, 90% of that will go towards food/rent (you will most likely rent as houses cost up in the millions...) - which making $60k in a smaller suburb area (where housing is in the affordable $50-$200k range) would arguably be the same net income as if you were working at Google.<p>I will say that you will earn more in the private sector - but I wouldn&#x27;t use miserable to describe government salaries (more like underpaid).

ARPANET was a (D)ARPA project that to my knowledge was started to have computers start interoperating with each other so researchers at universities could easily and generally transfer data and information with each other, e.g. research papers.<p>You may have noticed the &#x27;start&#x27; bit. The reason it was &#x27;starting&#x27; is because prior to that, corporations did NOT want you to have computers that could talk to each other. That would weaken their grip on the market and ability to lock you in; when no computers can talk to each other, and your business depends on computers from Corp X, this is good for them: you can&#x27;t go to anyone else. Printers, sockets, none of these are interoperable - you rely on them for everything.<p>As far as I understand, this is exactly what companies like GE did in those days. ARPANET was completely against everything they wanted, because it meant consumers were freed from their lock in. You could mix and match computers (perhaps cheaper, not-GE ones) with your GE machines, and you weren&#x27;t beholden to their whims (oh, you need a better mainframe? Gotta upgrade all your machines so they can talk to each other!) And it&#x27;s unlikely the &#x27;free market&#x27; would have ever bore out the same result, and if it did, it probably would have only happened decades later.<p>Of course, good luck explaining this shit to a libertarian-infested hellhole like HN: they all believe they&#x27;re on the cusp of Gettin&#x27; Big Bucks, so they don&#x27;t want a market that allows competition, or a government that regulates anything they do. They want one that allows them to strangle competition with no repercussions or limits - they&#x27;re just about to make it big after all as Uber Millionaires, and why do you want to steal their money!???!!<p>Like said elsewhere, Americans believe themselves to be impovershed millionaires, so they don&#x27;t want to limit their future greatness.

It sounds like the players can only choose from a number of options, but you have to physically go places to make those choices.<p>The worst part of the idea, in my opinion, is required visits to specific locations, in my opinion. If they were something like &quot;your office&quot; or &quot;any coffee shop&quot;, it would be easier to manage and destinations that more players would visit. By specifying that the game is localized around landmarks, you create so many problems. Now you have to define what the landmarks are yourself and manually place them. You have to do that for lots of cities if you want to facilitate a large userbase. You have to define choices and actions that make sense there. You have to test those locations and test that the actions there are possible. Then players need to go out of their way to visit those locations or remember to use your app while there. What about cities without specified locations? Can I play your game in Podunk, Idaho? That&#x27;s more work for minimal, if any, gain.<p>I think you don&#x27;t actually have an idea here. You need to think about this further. Would you really want to have to visit each of these places if you were a player? Would it be possible for you to become invested in someone else&#x27;s story if it requires you go out of your way to participate? Can you explain the game to someone in less than 10 words?

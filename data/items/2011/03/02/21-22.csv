2281540,comment,2273991,2275089,0,0,Groxx,,,"That's one of my main problems with cell phones in general.  We're still (behaviorally) used to in-home phones, where people call less frequently and more importantly, so interrupting your current task to answer it made sense.  Now, social calls are frequent, and people <i>still</i> interrupt whatever they're doing to answer the phone.  They're artificially high priority.<p>I let everyone know that phones, with me, are low priority - I have an answering machine.  Call logs.  I can see who you are and when you called whenever I have time - call me twice if it's <i>actually</i> important.<p>But I'll still check my phone to see who's calling me when it rings, because doing so is such a minor interruption and <i>might</i> be important and not everyone will try again - I'll probably pick up if a hospital or police department calls me.  It's not saying ""I have more important people to talk to than you"", it's saying ""Talking with you is not the most important thing that can possibly exist at this time"", which is true and expectable - wouldn't you like to know ASAP if your family is in the hospital?",1299103128

2281521,comment,2280470,2281430,0,0,cletus,,,"While I don't necessarily agree that Twitter is marketing fluff, as you seem to suggest (although I would say it's somewhat overhyped but not as much as, say, Quora), I will add this:<p>At any particular time there is a Zeitgeist in Silicon Valley. Currently that Zeitgeist is ""social"". Anything remotely ""social"" gets hyped into orbit. What's more, you see companies playing into that. VCs/angels are interested in social... entrepreneurs will start ""social"" companies.<p>A lot of these ""Zeitgeist echoes"" seem (at least to me) like they're built to get funding and built to flip. As such, the product is, at best, secondary. Instead you see the focus on getting publicity, getting stories written in TechCrunch, having the New York Times write about you, getting known for being hot amongst Valley insiders and so on.<p>Thing is, almost none of this translates to the mass market. Twitter at least has some mass market appeal but (at least it seems to me) its use case is narrower than envisioned, largely limited in being a communication vehicle for celebrities to send short messages to a large number of people (rather than being a tool for mass status update distribution, which is more Facebook's sphere of influence).<p>So I guess int hat respect it is like the movie analogy. Movies are clearly seen as products, almost a factory line in which you can put ingredients such as big-name stars, directors and writers and $100+ million and out comes a blockbuster.<p>You also see this in hardware it occurs to me. Like all the Android tablets. Motorola etc seem to have no idea of what they're marketing or who they're marketing too. They're simply trying ""shotgun marketing"" and hoping something sticks. It seems like only Apple and a handful of others really have a coherent vision and strategy (agree with it or not).",1299102891

2281519,comment,2280657,2281274,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I agree that they probably aren't doing complex user-identification...probably no cookies or JavaScript or anything like that happening on their CDN.<p>But, IP alone would be enough to follow the trail of most people (I know all the caveats about IP!=individual, but that data is still far from worthless), and collecting IP trails would be absolutely trivial and practically free from a performance perspective. The difference in a high performance webserver environment with logging vs. without logging is less than one percent...probably much less.<p>With a bit of clever data juggling, and logging of user agents and other information about the client, compare that to past visits from the same IP on properties where facebook has more data (from cookies and logged in activity), and identify users by name with pretty good accuracy.<p>In short: Performance is not a factor for logging, and facebook wouldn't need a large amount of additional cooperation from the client, like cookies or JavaScript bugs, to track users who aren't logged in. They just need to combine the already available log data in useful ways. A big part of the reason all these fancy distributed key/value stores and BigTable imitators exist (and why facebook has developed their own in-house) is for processing exactly this kind of data.<p>I'm extremely confident that facebook logs everything, though I have no idea what sorts of things they do with the resulting data.",1299102877

2281505,comment,2280051,2280846,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This is the core difference between information manufacture and real good manufacturing.<p>Real goods, such as the Chevy Malibu, have a pyramid of raw materials starting with ore mining, through smelting, through plastics creation, through tooling, to piecework to sub-assemblies, to assemblies to product.<p>Information goods on the other hand start with generally lower value information which gets collected and distributed and refined into higher value information. An inverted pyramid if you will.<p>And unlike ore, which once its in a Chevy Malibu is locked up 'forever', the information that is created can be re-used in an infinte number of additional products.<p>Consider a contructed example of company A which makes their money selling the current stock ticker from the NYSE, to company B, which takes that data and does analysis on it to create trading strategies for resale, which are purchased by company C which uses the trading strategies combined with capital acquisition from clients to make their money.<p>A completely different company, Q, might take the same stock ticker information from company A and make a large LED sign which can display it and sell those.<p>So the same 'information ore' is used in two separate product streams. There can be dozens of such streams. So evaluating the value of Facebook's information by the number of people Facebook employs really misstates the economic impact of a company like Facebook.<p>""The argument that the information world is the first to stack industries on other industries is fallacious, and misses the point entirely: Information doesn't take labor for every instance of product.""<p>I don't believe I made either of these claims.<p>To be clear, the claims I make are;\n1) Evaluating the information economy using the 'rules' of the real goods economy fails. \n2) The information that Facebook and Google create is more analagous to the ore someone might mine out of a mountain than the end product of vehicle brakes. (the real goods example used in the article).<p>I will grant you an example of someone making money off creating after market products for the Chevy Malibu as a valid post production economic activity, I know of no examples where people have collected Chevy Malibus and then turned them into a product that itself had mass market appeal.<p>It is the distinctive characteristic that information can be combined into new information which has its own intrinsic value, without losing or consuming the source information (ie removing its ability to take part in additional economic activity) that, for me, differentiates the two economic models.",1299102733

Doesn't every user have a potentially self-contradictory and possibly insane 'specification' for 'web browser' in their head, and don't they think it's a bug when that 'specification' is not adhered to?<p>Maybe I should have just said there are two kinds of software: Software that is an implementation of a mostly-stable specification, like a POSIX-compliant OS or the aforementioned avionics software, and software for which no specification, or at least no stable specification, exists, such as web browsers and text editors.",1299102272

The rumor mill says that in recent years we can expect a 0-5% raise in salary depending on job performance and how well the company did that year. Does being a new graduate with less than a year of experience change anything? I haven't been working here for very long (~10 months) but become significantly more productive each week. For tasks which do not require intimate knowledge of the legacy codebase I feel I am at least as productive as most of the more senior developers on the team but my salary is below the industry average.<p>According to the 2009 Alberta Wage and Salary Survey, (best resource I've found but still fairly vague) Albertans in the Computer Programmers and Interactive Media Developers occupational group earned from $16.83 to $113.22 an hour. The average wage was $38.17 an hour. Say I start at ~$25/hour. How much experience will I need before I can  start to expect making the 'average salary'?<p>Another question: Word on the web is that companies like Google and Apple don't compensate well, but all evidence I've seen points otherwise. How to explain this discrepancy? It was only last week that a very large number of people on Reddit and HN were discussing how challenging it is to break 6 figures as a developer. Based on what I've seen the tech giants (Google, Microsoft, Apple et al) actually seem to offer the highest compensation in the industry. A handful of companies like Netflix do pay better, but they're not based in Canada and the work environment seems to be much less relaxed.<p>I have no plans to leave but more information is better than less.",1299100288

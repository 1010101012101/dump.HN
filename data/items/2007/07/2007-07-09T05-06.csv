Funny how you didn't actually address any of the comments in the post itself.  I guess you consider it ""mission accomplished"" that people are hating on you because it implies you've been successful and you have.  Seriously Paul, hats off to you.  You've done a great job promoting what you think entrepreneurship is.  I just happen to think you're misleading people and where better to bring up that discussion than on YC News where you and your little converts spend that 25% of your time that is dedicated to talking about entrepreneurship rather than doing it :)",1183960239

While the hardware may not be as sexy as the iPhone, I hope it still gains market share among hackers.<p>The GTA01 is the device on sale now, but the GTA02 is the version you want (WiFi, 3D graphics, etc) and it comes out in October.",1183957607

If patents are secured, they can effectively be released into public domain, at least as far as I understand. Take a look at Xiph and Ogg; my understanding is that they publicly relinquished any rights to pursue infringement claims on their Vorbis-related (?) patents. IANAL.<p>Someone may also take a more creative route and attempt to make the point that software patents are terrible and evil by doing something absurd and high-profile by wielding them. For instance, if people can't get an iPhone anymore because of an injunction related to a patent suit, people will get mad and someone will probably at least try to fix the law, but probably end up making it worse. Generally, it seems people don't care about principle as much as they care about having their fleeting wants fulfilled.

Trying to do data parallelism in C is about the most brain-damaged idea ever. I don't know if anyone is working or interested in that, though.<p>You may well be right, but I challenge you to prove it. I myself am very interested in whether this would work. I have spent many sleepless nights programming GPU algorithms, and wondered if ideas from other programming languages and paradigms (especially functional programming) could be applied to make it easier and more elegant.<p>The nested data-parallelism approach does look promising on paper, and many people are well aware of the theoretical possibility of this working on GPUs (including people at Nvidia itself), but so far nobody succeeded to make it practical.<p>So, doing data parallelism in CUDA may be brain-damaged, but the flexibility and performance it delivers is mind-blowing. If you can achieve something comparable using a higher-level functional approach, I will be among your first users, and I'll tell everyone I know.<p>MultiLisp (AFAIK) is traditional task-parallelism rather than data-parallelism, and would not work well on a GPU.",1294476371

2082667,comment,2079166,2079166,0,0,rsepassi,,,"Have you considered giving a bit more structure to the ""Idea"" submission?  Maybe just split out basic questions like ""What problem is this solving?"", ""Who is this for?"", etc. into separate fields.  Might give it a bit more organization and would potentially allow users to categorize/search based on certain criteria.<p>One assumption that would need to be tested is whether people will take the time to review ideas.  And the other is whether people would be willing to disclose their ideas so publicly.  I think you can find better quotes/articles to help convince people to disclose their ideas.  Here's an excerpt from Paul Graham's How to Start a Startup essay you may want to use (PG has some more good quotes on the same topic in some other essays):<p>""An idea for a startup, however, is only a beginning. A lot of would-be startup founders think the key to the whole process is the initial idea, and from that point all you have to do is execute. Venture capitalists know better. If you go to VC firms with a brilliant idea that you'll tell them about if they sign a nondisclosure agreement, most will tell you to get lost. That shows how much a mere idea is worth. The market price is less than the inconvenience of signing an NDA.<p>Another sign of how little the initial idea is worth is the number of startups that change their plan en route. Microsoft's original plan was to make money selling programming languages, of all things. Their current business model didn't occur to them until IBM dropped it in their lap five years later.<p>Ideas for startups are worth something, certainly, but the trouble is, they're not transferrable. They're not something you could hand to someone else to execute. Their value is mainly as starting points: as questions for the people who had them to continue thinking about.""",1294475698

For the ones you identify as still too advanced, specifically identify the pieces you still need.  Judge whether or not you (or a team you know/could put together) could develop any or all of those pieces.  If so, do it.  If not, wait.  In the meantime, constantly ask ""What's the best way to solve this problem given what I can do today?"" and do whatever the answer is.",1294473666
2082611,comment,2081436,2081436,0,0,solost,,,"My recommendation to you is to decide what type of consultancy you want.  One where you are in charge but hire a project manager to do all of the day to day management or one where you are in charge and also responsible for the day to day management.<p>I run my own firm and I love what I do, however I only do actual client work 20% of the time, the rest of the time I am HR, Accounting, and Business Development.  My business is nearly 100% referral yet business development still takes up nearly 50% of my time due to the fact that I feel I need to own and manage the client relationships.  However I have an amazing project manager to keep all of the projects on track.<p>I would encourage anyone who wants to operate their own business to do so, just remember it is incredibly important to learn what it takes to set up and operate a business properly before making the commitment.  Even if you think you know what you are doing, nothing can beat having a knowledgeable and trustworthy accountant and lawyer to aid you on your way.<p>The second thing you have to strongly consider is can you recruit the talent necessary to support the business?  One of the reasons I was able to start my own firm is I spent a decade building a dependable network of service providers that I can rely for everything I need. I have used these people for a long time and between them and the people they can recommend, I am never left in desperate need of skills or man power to get the work done.<p>Finally consider the type of lifestyle you want to have?  Operating a consulting firm in its formative years can really erode your work life balance.  Many people love the idea of operating their own business but are completely unprepared when they discover just how different it is from being a freelancer.",1294473631

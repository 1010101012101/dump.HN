Unless you want something that is going to be absolutely no bother, and that doesn&#x27;t need anything at all done to it, then you can spend a few thousand pounds at most and still get something in reasonable nick. For instance, my current car came with around 17,000 miles on the clock and cost £1,300.<p>A Prius would cost me £21,995 - around 16 times as much. Though there are far more expensive cars out there, that they can&#x27;t even get basic security right is fairly disgraceful....",1429117174

That&#x27;s not an intrinsic limitation of people, it&#x27;s just that people tend to focus on different things. To bring someone else&#x27;s perspective into their view is difficult and takes time, especially if there is no easy way to share one&#x27;s perspective (different languages, different cultures, different life experiences).<p>I think that if we can find ways to express (sound) ideas to people in ways that they can understand, we will find that most people will agree and want to build that better future. Actually building that future requires solving technical problems, but also requires political solutions to resolve the inevitable clashes of perspective (and flat-out wrongness) that will occur.",1429117147

9382258,comment,9380635,9381802,0,0,mmanulis,,,"I&#x27;m not convinced that leading is the job of a manager, at least not all managers.  As an example, a line manager, someone who manages the work of several developers, is more of a Project Manager / People Manager and less a leader.<p>Maybe this is getting too much into semantics. A leader, as I tend to think of that position, is about setting direction, guiding the vision, dealing with the culture, more strategic in whatever they are leading.  This could be a company or a project or a product, doesn&#x27;t have to be high-falutin, can be as simple as leading a project to completion.  The focus, however, is really about the strategic view of whatever it is that&#x27;s being led.<p>A manager is the tactical view. Making sure people have enough work and that work fits the project. Making sure that the people doing the work are the right ones to do that work (some crossover into leadership here, can&#x27;t help that).  A manager is really part communication traffic cop (in a positive sense, not &quot;give you a ticket&quot; sense), part nanny (reward & punish behavior), part mentor and part canary for the upper management of things going wrong.<p>As a side note, this is why I found 1-1s valuable at all levels of managing.  When I was running several teams, making sure my leads were having 1-1s with their people and talking about how their teams are doing gave me a view I would not have had otherwise.  I&#x27;m still learning about this though.<p>Part of my thinking about the original comment was about the role of management in an ideal scenario.  If you remove the &quot;human machine&quot; from the conversation and look at what most of the time managers at all levels are doing, it&#x27;s communication management.  Yes, this is an overgeneralization to a great degree, but it helps me to think about management in that way.<p>If your manager built his/her interactions with you around things you need to know (communicating vision, direction, business needs, etc.) from above and took your feedback and communicated it up, then you get lots of conversations and feedback loops.  This requires the upper management to listen to what the people on the ground are saying, which is rare in my limited experience.<p>Incidentally, what you get is managing the what and not the how, letting individual contributors deal with the how.  Which opens up a whole can of worms for corporations and, sometimes, from a legal perspective too - think SOX & HIPAA as examples.<p>Bottom line, I believe management is to leadership as tactical view is to strategic view.  Genuine communication is what management is all about, makes our work interactions human and makes it easier to give and receive feedback across the entire org.<p>Of course I just described a utopia, but it&#x27;s nice to work towards that, even if it&#x27;s just a person approach.",1429116441

It&#x27;s like saying that because you can earn a paycheck above poverty level, you can be richer than Bill Gates, Carlos Slim and King Midas put together. In theory yes, but this reasoning fails to address important practical concerns.<p>Regarding immortality, you have to remember that every time a major death cause has been neutralized, the probability distribution reorganizes itself and other death causes raise to pick up the slack, even causes which used to be unknown/negligible a few decades ago. That&#x27;s to say, every life that has been &quot;saved&quot; from smallpox, polio or whatever was not really saved - strictly speaking those people still died (or will eventually die) anyways of a different cause.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that life expectancy cannot be extended, or that that is not a worthy goal in itself. But there is still the practical issue that the clock is ticking for every one of us. According to current data, I am expected to live another 40 years or so. During that time, the line can maybe pushed another 10 years, and combined with positive lifestyle changes, having won the genetic lottery in the form of my family having a track record of many long lived members, and a bit of luck too, I don&#x27;t think it is unreasonable to think that I personally might make it to 100 years in a relatively dignified state. However, that&#x27;s it, I will already be old and wasted by then, and the only hope I can think on how to extend that even further would be Deux ex Machina.<p>Now consider the scenario for a baby born today. Maybe those 100 years will give him plenty of time for science to progress and fix a lot of things during his own time... assuming no major threats raise caused by our increasingly industrialized lifestyles, which is doubtful. Maybe all the things considered he will live to see a time when 150 is the average, and he may be able to push it to 170 by being smart and having a lifestyle healthier than average... but that&#x27;s it.<p>If I were extremely optimistic, which I find hard to be these days, I would say this trend will stagnate around the 300&#x27;s due to the law of diminishing returns. So, our descendants might see a time when dying at mere 100 years old is a tragedy, but there is a world of difference from that and actual elf-style immortality (never age or die but by an act of violence that destroys your physical anchoring to this world).",1429116120

Note protecting <i>competitors</i> from rivals is not the same as protecting <i>competition</i>; in fact, having bureaucrats cripple some firms and favor others can reduce competition and injects politics and lobbying and who-golfs-with-the-commissioner into the process. It also can lead to bizarre results like the lack of a reasonably viable way to &quot;fix&quot; things.<p>The U.S. approach toward dominant firm behavior (well, since the 1970s) has been different. It focuses on intervening when there&#x27;s <i>consumer harm</i>, or at least tries to. If consumers are not harmed, the logic goes, there is likely no reason for the Feds to intervene.

For most college-level demos, a mostly-static demo with just enough javascript to pull data to make it feel fresh is a &quot;hack&quot; that will get you further than your peers. Depending on your level of ethics, some companies will actually do demos that are this level of wire-and-duct-tape to sell the product, and then build it afterwards. The one big catch with this approach is that you can&#x27;t pitch something that&#x27;s non-trivial technically -- if you do, and can&#x27;t demonstrate you figured out the secret sauce, then your pitch becomes worthless.<p>Many first-timers will walk into a hackathon with just their laptop, and get stuck in the trap of setting up their environment over the whole weekend. They&#x27;ll spend hours trying to download an IDE and interpreter/compiler and libraries over a poor or nonexistent internet connection. For these people, &quot;build some static web pages&quot; is one of the easiest ways to get them to the point where they have something they can comfortably demo in front of their peers -- and so what if it doesn&#x27;t really work; they had fun and can come back next time.<p>If you build a thing that really works, fine. But a lot of people also walk into hackathons with pre-formed teams and 80% completed projects (idea, mocks and artwork already done; IDEs already set up; maybe even hardware already wired up) and having an emphasis on &quot;real working code&quot; for a time-constrained event only encourages this sort of &quot;cheating&quot;.",1429115195

The presumption of a lot of anti-trust law is that protecting competition is in the long term public interest that outweigh short term impact on consumers. Some anti-trust actions are motivated by direct consumer interest, but most is motivated by preventing anti-competitive practices by a monopolist from harming competitors.<p>If competitors of Google Shopping are treated fairly in terms of search results, and can buy the same kind of position that Google Shopping can (I don&#x27;t think they can), then there would be no issue.<p>My point in terms of Amazon is not that Amazon search isn&#x27;t different to Google - clearly they are, though they too have paid third party results on their pages.<p>My point is that <i>to Google</i> it&#x27;s their search dominance they need to downplay, not the relatively market position of Google Shopping.

9381987,comment,9381437,9381637,0,0,rogerbinns,,,"The US tax code is stupidly complex.  There are over 500 changes a year made.  That is just federal taxes.  You are also affected by state, county and city laws.  For all practical purposes, it is impossible to do the returns 100% correctly.  Legislators use the tax code extensively to achieve things, from social good through corporate welfare and what most would consider outright corruption.  Voters in areas may also add to laws with various funding initiatives (eg extra taxes to cover funding for school construction).<p>Look at sales tax just for California - <a href=""http://www.boe.ca.gov/sutax/pam71.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boe.ca.gov/sutax/pam71.htm</a> - and that table of quicklinks should frighten you.  That is just scratching the surface.  For example sales tax for in person transactions is charged based on the address of the store.  Unless you buy a car, in which case it is your home address.<p>Two other factors apply.  One is an American mentality that doing minor things against the law isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> wrong, and being caught is where it becomes real.  An example is speeding - it almost seems a contest of wits to not get caught, rather than fixing the limits or realising why they exist.  Is it wrong to lie on your tax return about something, where the odds of getting caught are very low, and everyone else is doing it anyway?  An example of that is how people call Amazon sales tax free because they are out of state.  The supreme court says yes they are sales tax free (to not hinder interstate commerce), but then states charge a &quot;use tax&quot; which happens to be exactly the same as the sales tax.  Very few people admitted to their out of state purchases since they were so unlikely to get caught.<p>The final factor is a distrust of government.  They are seen as plodding, corrupt, useless, expensive, political, uncaring and largely pointless.  They are very rarely seen as an instrument of voter will.  This is what provides the perennial source of jokes - the DMV (department of motor vehicles), the IRS, city hall and all that.  Who would trust government to get things right?<p>So tax returns turn into a contest.  What do people think they get away with?  Which of the many rules will they obey to the letter?  What are their neighbours and others getting away with?  Was that really a business lunch? How am I paying more tax than I need to?<p>Despite their values, neither of the main two political parties do anything to fix this.  They are however happy to keep adding to the piles of laws, which makes it more expensive to comply, and increasingly unfair.<p>I often end up paying fines on my returns.  This is not because I am a bad person, and I actually try very hard to get it all correct.  It is just cheaper than doing some things the right way, and fairly normal!  Some of those fines are also because I don&#x27;t have a time machine, and I couldn&#x27;t actually do things correctly without one.<p>(Note that factors above are generalisations, and don&#x27;t apply to every last person.)",1429114582

Is this some kind of legally regulated category that says you a) must only return Web results and b) in the form of 10 blue links?<p>Should a search which a search engine knows the direct answer to (word definitions, the current weather or time, etc) send you to another site for the answer. Why are &quot;search engines&quot; prohibited from direct answers, but voice agents like Siri allowed? Is there something fundamentally different between a text box and a voice input?<p>Likewise, if a search engine has indexed data and can return deep links to other sites formatted differently, why is that different? For example, if you search for &quot;Playstation 4&quot; and Google simply returned the first 10 hits (Amazon.com, eBay, Walmart, etc) as a page of 10 blue links like it did in 2006, instead of formatting them in a nice box at the top of the screen with summary price extracted, would this still be illegal? Why is it legal to display organic search results as blue links, but if you display them in a box and call it &quot;Product Search&quot;, it&#x27;s suddenly illegal? This makes no sense to me. The only difference between the Google Product Search box at the top, and displaying the links is simply better visual presentation.<p>The world has moved on from ten blue links. Mobile devices have even more constrained real estate and network latency pushing the need for summarization and smart presentation even further.

If you have a good product comparison engine these days, you&#x27;re probably going to end up as a native app anyway.<p>By the time this EU case winds down (Microsoft&#x27;s took a decade), the traditional web search engine might not even exist anymore.",1429114425

It&#x27;s unfortunately hard to not sound like a crackpot on this sort of issue, because there are a lot of relativity-is-wrong crackpots.<p>As far as special relativity goes, the aether ends up being equivalent to a having preferred rest frame. It&#x27;s not wrong, but it&#x27;s unnecessary. You still have the light speed limit and length contraction and time dilation and all the same math (which is an unfortunately post-hoc insight), they just take on a different philosophical character. PhysicsForums has a good summary [1]:<p>> <i>Both BU and LET use the Lorentz transform, etc., to make all of their experimental predictions, and therefore they are scientifically indistinguishable, making the same experimental predictions in all cases. Because of this experimental equivalence, there is little if any serious ongoing debate between the two in professional physics circles (although the philosophy literature does have ongoing debate).</i><p>For me the intuition pump for BU=LET was reading The Strange World of Classical Physics [2].

The vertical integration model, used quite successfully by both Google and Apple, is specifically designed to make it unfavorable or impossible to use competitors.<p>At least under the US definition, the practice of &quot;tying&quot; is illegal when you use your monopoly position in one market to try to monopolize another market. By using Search to prioritize promoting their other services, they are trying to capture other markets through their dominance in Search. This is what the law was written to prevent. Most of my issues stem with how they do this in Android though, which is a separate investigation the EU is conducting.<p>Google&#x27;s Search behavior hurts consumers in a lot of ways. Since Google is the front door to the Internet, effectively, particularly in Europe where their market share is nearly uncontested, being an unfavorable result in Google prevents you from adequately competing. Being &quot;penalized&quot; by Google Search for any reason can put you out of business.<p>And Google is now trying to exact their will on the entire Internet through penalizing sites in Search as a means of activism.

There are very bright people working in both communities and there is a lot of passion for the languages.  Unlike something like Java or Php, if you are working in one of those languages it is largely because you <i>want</i> to be.  That said, I&#x27;d say both communities suffer from an abundance of arrogance that is above normal for other languages.<p>Item 2:
You can learn go in a couple of hours.  Its warts are obvious on casual inspection and typically if you aren&#x27;t doing something the &quot;go way&quot; you will pay for it.  This usually isn&#x27;t a practical problem but occasionally the &quot;go way&quot; leaves you stuck.<p>It took me a solid year to learn Scala to the point I would call myself competent.  I still have zero degree of confidence in dropping into an existing Scala project for the first time.  Part of that is a design decision as there is &quot;no&quot; Scala way.  Part of that is the community itself has a large contingent of language tinkerers who will try out experimental features.  But I&#x27;ve never seen a problem that couldn&#x27;t be solved in a Scala code base in an &quot;elegant&quot; way.  Incomprehensible is also easier in Scala.<p>Item 3:
I doubt there is any way to predict this and it is largely not the way I would choose a language.<p>Personally, golang the language irritates me like crazy.  I do like the simplicity for small web services or cli tools though.  If something starts approaching the &quot;bash is too much&quot; here, I happily do a quick golang program.  This is more a function of the go tool chain than anything else, but if golang has proven anything, its that the tool chain matters.<p>Conversely, I doubt I will ever write a system again in Scala.  I&#x27;m glad I did, and learning Scala made me hone some development chops I wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise, but it isn&#x27;t something I love programming in (even though it doesn&#x27;t irritate me like golang does).<p>My advice would be to learn Scala, but that is largely because I think paradigm shifts are more long term rewarding than language/framework shifts.  Golang hasn&#x27;t taught me anything I didn&#x27;t already know and if you <i>do</i> need to learn it for a job or something it isn&#x27;t hard to do.",1429114173

Or maybe I&#x27;m a little brain damaged after my copy of Sedgewick dropped of the bookshelf and onto my head. Maybe those early, informative years spent cutting my teeth on assembly have done some irreparable damaged to my psyche. Stop pandering, lend a hand, lend encouragement to the folks who need it. Everyone had helped along but way, and I spend way too much time tutoring folks, but stop pushing folks into the industry who are chasing the almighty dollar or just aren&#x27;t interested. Help them get their feet wet, but if they don&#x27;t like it, don&#x27;t force them off the diving board. I&#x27;m gonna be maintaining their cruft long after they&#x27;re gone.",1429113871

The IRS single handily keeps the Post Office in business, not to mention the cost and time/labor expense of the tax payers. (at least we get to deduct tax prep cost...if you can actually itemize..)<p>Let&#x27;s get the basic forms first. The IRS should have an easier method of somebody getting the information about them that was sent in from entities electronically. Set up an API, I&#x27;m sure the NSA will let them use their server farms... This alone would probably eliminate the need for 80% of the population to ever have to file.

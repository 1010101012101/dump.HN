It's just that your ideas are consistently inane and not worth talking about. ...""</i><p>I don't think Amichail is inane. Inane is defined as <i>""empty""</i>, <i>""vain""</i> or <i>""lacking of meaning""</i>. I recognise the behaviour Amichail is displaying, <i>""continuously asking lots of questions""</i>. As a kid I did this. I asked so many questions I distinctly remember my old man telling me to shut-up. So I did. Then had the problem of teachers asking me why I never bothered asking for help. In the real world continuously asking questions and being curious seems stupid, pointless and suppressed.<p>HN isn't a slice of the regular world. Tolerance of eccentric and unusual behaviour strengthens HN not weakens it. So let Amichail ask as many questions as possible, don't suppress the questioning, it's a sign of youthful curiosity.<p>Harnessing Amichail as a sounding board for ideas and pointing out any weakness in ideas seems more reasonable than scolding.",1257494029

925649,comment,925539,925539,0,0,carpdiem,,,"I think this post title is misleading.<p>Roger Penrose is not merely saying that quantum mechanics is wrong.  Instead it would be more fair to say that he views quantum mechanics as an incomplete theory, and one that should be continually challenged.<p>It's like Newtonian mechanics.  Newtonian mechanics is correct, within its domain (for velocities much less than the speed of light).  No one argues with the predictions of Newtonian mechanics within their domain.  Einstein's achievement with special relativity, then, wasn't showing that Newtonian mechanics was wrong; instead, he just showed the world the true extent of its domain, and developed a theory (special relativity) that generalized Newtonian mechanics to a larger domain (velocities less than the speed of light).  It's terribly unfair to Newtonian mechanics to call it 'wrong' in the same way that the statement 2+2=5 is 'wrong'.<p>Similarly, the fantastic experimental success of quantum mechanics ensures that it would be unfair to call quantum mechanics 'wrong'.  Incomplete?  Certainly.  Worthy of being challenged?  Absolutely.  Is it taken as gospel by too many physicists?  Probably.  But is quantum mechanics <i>wrong</i>?  No, decades of successful experiments, and practically the entire modern electronics industry, would disagree with that sentiment.  The problem is that we just don't know where the domain of quantum mechanics ends, nor the more general theory that will take its place.",1257493493

It doesn't try to be a general-purpose programming language, it is honed over years to do exactly what control engineers want to do day-to-day.<p>It's like Python is a better programming environment than Excel too, but spreadsheets aren't going away anytime soon (it remains to be seen whether Python + OOo wins over the long term)<p>Mathworks could do a lot worse than bolt on an optional Python front-end.

925635,comment,925236,925236,0,0,kingsley_20,,,"What follows are the musings of an ex-lingerie designer.<p>Side note: Humans, btw, are the only animals that sport full breasts all through their youth. Most mammals, including all simians and apes, only sport enlarged breasts when feeding their young.<p>Simplistically, cup-size is the chest-to-breast ratio, designed to compensate for the fact that radius of the cup is almost, but not entirely, independent of the chest circumference. It does not have a strong correlation to volume of the cup or to mass, although acute cup-sizes are more common at larger chest sizes.<p>Human bodies grow very disproportionately at either extreme of size. For example, height is a very poor indicator of girth, although it bears a small correlation, and vice versa. Similarly, larger women have a higher incidence of acute cup-sizes, but the shape, consistency and mass of the breasts are very different from what you'd expect through linear scaling.<p>Ultimately, larger women are a different market. It's common for a larger woman to have large breasts that have a small footprint on her torso. Most lingerie does not account for this. Most lingerie is also not built to bear the weight/consistency of larger breasts. You need to use load-distributing design, as well as resilient/soft materials to ease the stress on the back. And then, you have to put the whole thing together into a sexy package. It almost make it more fun to write code :)",1257492196

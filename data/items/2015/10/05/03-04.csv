The thing that interested me the most was the discussion of the scold, a figure that makes a lot of appearances in art from the time. The scold, the over-domineering woman who beat/verbally humiliated her husband, was a character that seemed to provoke a fair amount of anxiety in people during this time. An unruly woman like a scold was thought to represent a house in disorder, and was seen as the result of a husband&#x27;s failure to adequately assert his masculine authority. To counter the behavior of the scold, a husband could employ a number of strategies, including the scold&#x27;s bridle, which you can see here: <a href=""http://bit.ly/1QTuxrU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/1QTuxrU</a> and here: <a href=""http://bit.ly/1PedRgu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/1PedRgu</a> It&#x27;s an amazing historical artifact of a time when female speech was particularly feared.

It&#x27;s a series of small decisions that add up to a huge sacrifice. It&#x27;s like boiling a frog. Nobody ever says when you sign up, oh, you&#x27;ll have to skip Easter Dinner because you can&#x27;t afford two hours off that week.<p>The trick is to create a culture where it is not only normal, but taken for granted, that you work all the time. They work with a bunch of other smart, capable people. They can&#x27;t all be wrong can they? (yes, but it&#x27;s easy to see why they can&#x27;t see it).<p>So the mechanism of the slave driving isn&#x27;t just someone sitting there telling you--work 100 hours a week or you are fired. It&#x27;s by assigning you almost unlimited work and having a competitive environment where you look bad if you can&#x27;t complete it.<p>So these people become their own slave drivers. They stay at work late without having to be asked. They make the choice themselves. It&#x27;s a sick culture, but it makes their stockholders money. You actually feel bad when taking time off because you feel like you are falling behind.<p>Part of it is definitely the striver culture that elite education often encourages. You are supported to give full intensity and take any abuse to succeed.<p>However, I wouldn&#x27;t write off all people like this off as sheep. I bet you&#x27;d be very surprised how you react under similar pressures. And certainly some tech companies employ similar tactics and have similar cultures of encouraging people to give 100% effort.<p>Another big factor in these sorts of jobs is that it&#x27;s view as a temporary hardship. You do a stint and exit into the &quot;good jobs&quot; that aren&#x27;t this insane. That causes people to try to tough it out. And they end up breaking before they bend.",1444016273

This is a common idea in most programming languages and some Functional languages, such as Haskell, tend to take it to an extreme. And yet, it is not as common as it should be in Clojure.<p>One of his rules is &quot;If your function starts with a conditional, get rid of the conditional and look for that pattern in your function arguments.&quot; That is, move the conditional into the different versions of your function.<p>Also, his &quot;Recursive Function Pattern Matching Pattern&quot; makes recursion much easier to read.

This isn&#x27;t the first place that Rust makes this tradeoff: immutability itself is entirely useless in Rust except as a means to to aid programmer correctness (to wit: as a result of tracking ownership, Rust could trivially infer immutability based on usage patterns, but when the devs hinted at the idea of removing immutability the community rallied in opposition (the legendary &quot;mutpocalypse&quot;)).<p>Furthermore, the forthcoming work on incremental recompilation intends to leverage the fact that function signatures are infallible in order to enable drastically improved incrementalism (no need to even consider recompiling code that calls a function if only the body of the called function changes), and the same fact will be leveraged to enable huge parallelism in incrementally compiled units.<p>Furtherfurthermore, Rust deliberately doesn&#x27;t employ Hindley-Milner and so I&#x27;m not even 100% certain that whole-program type inference is feasible.",1444014450

Or that making them more complicated is desirable in itself. Just that there are better ways of inferring structure from data.<p>Just correlating two variables will often be misleading. E.g. the coffee drinkers that live longer. But if you collect a ton of other information, you will find many other relevant variables. And once you build a model from all that information, you find that coffee no longer predicts mortality.<p>Of course there is a limit to the amount of causal structure you can infer from data. But that limit is well above what we are currently doing. And the more relevant data you collect, the higher that limit is.<p>This is basically what the field of machine learning is. Where we want computers to automatically model our data and make the most accurate predictions for us. Tons of methods  are invented and tested against each other on different datasets. There are websites like kaggle where users compete to find the best model for a dataset. But somehow none of this innovation goes back to mainstream statistics or used in scientific studies to get better models.<p>And machine learning sucks too. A lot of methods use maximum likelihood with some tricks to keep it from overfitting. Rather than ideal bayesian methods. And the models are kind of simple. Like simple decision trees or linear models.<p>I think in the future we will use something like bayesian neural networks. Which can model very complicated structures with little data. And we won&#x27;t arbitrarily select some of the variables to be inputs and some to be outputs. All of the observed variables are outputs of some unobserved function with unobserved inputs. We need to model that.<p>Then you have a fully general statistics algorithm that you can plug any dataset into. You can then ask it questions like &quot;if I observed that this person drank coffee, but everything else I know about them is the same, what is their mortality?&quot; And then it will give you the most accurate possible answer.<p>Is that proof of causation? No. But it&#x27;s far more likely that coffee causes cancer if it can accurately predict it, even when you control for all other variables. Than if you just see that it happens to correlate with cancer.",1444014430

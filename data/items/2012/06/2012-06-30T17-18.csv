On my view, it's uncivilized to treat barbaric ideas and behavior as if they are civilized, because that only fosters barbarity.<p>Many people are confused on this point. They think that you should be polite as an absolute (even while they claim that ""there are no absolutes""), but usually they are hypocrites about it, because they become quite rude if you disagree with them about their ""be polite all the time"" zealotry, which reveals what is <i>really</i> behind their pretense at being polite.",1341079142

4182313,comment,4181396,4181396,4,0,tzs,,,"DO NOT USE FOR ANYTHING IMPORTANT!!!!! CRYPTOBYTE IS NOT SECURE AT THIS TIME!!!!!<p>The developer says:<p><pre><code>   CryptAByte uses public-key encryption just
   like HTTPS/SSL and OpenPGP/PGP. The algorithms
   used are RSA for key pairs, AES 256 to encrypt
   messages and files, and SHA 256 for hashing. The
   servers hosting this application support can encrypt
   2.1 GB of data per second using the latest Intel CPUs
   with AES support built into the chipset.
</code></pre>
Server-side encryption means that the people running the server have access to the plaintext. The web interface simply does a PUT request that sends the plaintext to the server.<p>Another problem is that they are storing your private RSA key on their server. When you ask to retrieve your messages, you do an AJAX POST request, giving a token to identify they key, and your password. Presumably, the key is encrypted using the password.<p>If their servers are compromised, whether by hackers or by search warrant, the security of your private key depends on how good your password is. They are pitching this as bringing good security to the masses. THE MASSES SUCK AT CHOOSING GOOD PASSWORDS. If you want to bring good security to the masses, it is ludicrous to make the security of the system rest on the ability of the masses to pick a high entropy password.<p>In defense of the developer, it is quite possible he knows all this. In the interview the article mentions (<a href=""http://libertarianstandard.com/2012/06/07/exclusive-interview-with-cryptabytes-creator-david-veksler/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://libertarianstandard.com/2012/06/07/exclusive-intervie...</a>), it is clear that this is an experiment at this stage, and it is quite possible that the developer has simply not gotten around to addressing those issues yet. The author of the article clearly has no technical knowledge of cryptography whatsoever, and so may have not understood that CryptAByte is an early stage exploration of concepts at this point.<p>I've got some experience designing a similar product, and I'm pretty sure that when he does get around to dealing with those issues he's going to find that it cannot be done without abandoning the idea of doing at all on the web. As far as I can see, to be secure even with users who do not pick strong passwords, you need access to the local filesystem and to a local source of cryptographically secure random numbers.<p>From the article (so blame the article author, not the developer):<p><pre><code>   But it gets more brilliant. How can you know that you can
   really trust the service, or that Veksler himself works for
   the FBI or the like? Well, you dont have to trust him. Veksler
   is making the entire apparatus completely open source so that
   anyone can inspect the code. He does nothing on the site that is
   not wholly open to the world, so that way anyone can know everything
   that is going on in the engine room but no one, not even the service
   owner, can know what is being communicated.

Pure bullshit. The user has no way of knowing that the code ACTUALLY RUNNING on the site is the same as the code that is released as open source.",1341079076

An indirect function call on some architecture, for example, could require that when one makes an indirect call one sets up several registers in addition to jumping to a particular location in memory, and none of the registers that need to be set up can be derived from the jump target.  So in practice your function pointers would need to actually be structures containing those register values and the jump target.  Or you might need to pass around a tuple of target and calling convention, although the C standard limits the ways you could implement that (namely by requiring that function pointers cast to and from other function pointer types will compare as equal, and will still work when they are cast to the correct type.)",1341078757

That said, if you <i>have</i> 5 dedicated servers, why even bother with EC2? It's more expensive in every way. ""Pay more as you grow"" is actually extremely expensive for what you actually get. Infinite scalability? Please. When people think about scalability, they think about adding a few gigs of ram to their VM with a little more I/O throughput (e.g. migrating from VM1 to VM2) for <i>hundreds</i> of dollars, and it's <i>still</i> shitty VM performance compared to raw metal. Instead, why not spend that money on a few good dedicated boxes with 96-128gb+ ram and a bunch of true (not virtual) CPU cores, then you're done for a while, and for the same price.

Yes! It's a horrible mess.  Politicians --all sides and ideology-- are solely engaged in pandering to those who will vote for them.  Reason be damned.  They want to keep their jobs and continue to enjoy the ride.  Almost nothing else matters to these people.<p>Sometimes I feel that it would be very wise to modify the system such that politics truly becomes serving the country rather than a life-long career.  A senator would have to go back to work in the real world every so many years if he/she wants to have the right to come back to government.  Equal time.  Serve six years and then do six years in private life, or some variant thereof.<p>At some level these people (again, any side) are so polarized that even basic arithmetic escapes them.  And, in the end, we are the ones that have to pay for their moronic decisions.  From unnecessary wars and bases all over the world to down-right criminal pension systems and benefits for government workers.  Examples abound with the current extremes being physically located at places like Iraq + Afganistan and Stockton and (soon to come to a boil) California.<p>> I for one, haven't heard anything about the health care ruling opening the door to tax people for not buying government approved healthy foods, not using mass transportation, etc. But, I imagine we get our media from different sources.<p>No, that part was my extrapolation of the Supreme Court ruling on the matter.<p>As for where I got the news, well, I took the time to read the Supreme Court decision here:<p><a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/98542275/Scotus-opinion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/98542275/Scotus-opinion</a><p>It's an interesting read.  I've never done this before.  The first page gets down to the meat and potatoes of the matter:<p><quote>
One key provision isthe individual mandate, which requires most Americans to maintain ""minimum essential"" health insurance coverage. 26 U. S. C. 5000A.For individuals who are not exempt, and who do not receive health insurance through an employer or government program, the means of satisfying the requirement is to purchase insurance from a private company. Beginning in 2014, those who do not comply with themandate must make a ""[s]hared responsibility payment"" to the Federal Government. 5000A(b)(1). The Act provides that this ""penalty"" will be paid to the Internal Revenue Service with an individual's taxes, and ""shall be assessed and collected in the same manner"" as tax penalties.
</quote><p>The simplification of this idea is what I was after:  Buy this (or do this) or we will impose a tax penalty for failing to comply.<p>The Supreme Court just told all of us that this is perfectly legal and legitimate.  And that might very well be absolutely true.  Now, I am not a student of these things at all, but I am having trouble finding another example of the government penalizing citizens for not buying something through taxation.  I can't point to one thing in my household that would result in a penalty tax if I did not fall-in and get it.<p>I argue --as an non-lawyer-- that this precedent opens the doors for a slippery slope where government can force you to do things through tax penalties as devised in the healthcare law.  This is the part that I am concerned about.<p>And no, I am not right-wing or left.  I am and independent thinker with a strong preference for non-creative arithmetic, individual freedom, free markets, low taxation, and the government staying the hell away from my life as much as possible.",1341076807

The only time shareholders will see the corporation's income is if such income is distributed to them.  Generally, this happens via: (1) a distribution of the corporation's assets, (2) a dividend, i.e., a distribution of the corporation's earnings and profits but not its assets, (3) a redemption which decreases the shareholder's ownerhsip, or (4) a liquidation which eliminates all shareholder's ownerships.<p>Capital gains reflects the increase in the market value of the corporation.  It is entirely possible, and usually is the case, that the market value of corporate stock is based on the ""goodwill"" value of the corporation (i.e., brand strength) rather than the corporation's cash earnings.

I see it both in your choice of and approach to research (interviews, case studies, etc. as opposed to purely technical), and in the way you recognized and clarified the socio-political barriers to graduating (the subtleties in finding the right project and people).<p>A couple of childhood friends just finished their third year of their PhD programs, one in molecular biology and the other in physical chemistry, and are very much in that all-too-common third/fourth year rut.

You can see wealthin buildings and streets, in the clothes and the health of the people.</i><p>And you can see in the US that increases in wealth disparity have had a negative effect on some of these measures. Healthcare outcomes and the state of road repair are two headline examples of what suffers when the wealthy become so wealthy as to resemble an aristocracy rather than a bourgeoisie. It's often pointed out on HN that there is a seperate legal system for those with money. Likewise, the wealthy have outsized control of the legislative process and the levers of government in general, and they have used this power to enrich themselves at the expense of the lower tiers of society.<p>No, wealth is not a zero sum game, but when the wealthy use their power to make sure they don't have to contribute to the government purse and keep a greater share of corporate wealth for the very top of the hierarchy, they impoverish the rest of society by destroying the foundation that allows people with fewer advantages to turn their labor into wealth.<p><i>A 747 pilot doesn't make 40 times as much as a checkout clerk because he is a warlord who somehow holds her in thrall. His skills are simply much more valuable.</i><p>Pilots are also supported by a union that undoubtedly increases their pay. There are many more pilots than there are jobs for pilots, which suggests that they are not paid market rates.<p><i>I cannot but feel pulled in the opposite direction by some kind of populist/socialist desire to chip in more and make society a better place.</i><p>You can believe that wealth disparity is bad for the country without being some sort of squishy idealist. Most wealthy people are not like Paul Graham. They are largely in corporate management and finance. It can be argued whether CEOs are worth what companies pay for them, but it does appear that most people who truly have a lot of money are rent seekers, not innovators. And they have actively attempted to make it harder for people who are not already wealthy to become like them.",1341075790

Could be that I am on MBPwRD, but I really doubt that. Gonna get a thunderbolt display and see.<p>Also there are many glitches with exporting that have not been yet fixed and I have even got an email from the Sketch developers saying that they did not notice the bugs I reported repetitively.<p>That said, I kind of regret getting rid of Photoshop and working in Sketch and Pixelmator full-time. I may be putting Photoshop back on as it so far renders everything as it is - that means perfectly and can export it that way as well; but I am going to put PS back on only when the CC version gets &quot;a better trial&quot; - I am not willing to pay around 70 bucks a month and not fully own the app for as long as I want. That&#x27;s way too much for a subscription like that. Also my be cause I hate subscription system, don&#x27;t believe cloud and I want to own the product. Not having problem like this with Sketch - I even purchased a copy for my fiancée - 50 bucks is a steal, I would not hesitate to drop 300 bucks, if they would fix bugs, performance issues and added all the features I need.<p>Can&#x27;t wait what bjango is going to come up with, Marc is an awesome designer, the Skala is gonna be a blast.",1371935482

We were out rafting, and I had swayed away from the raft swimming in light rapids (the instructor said its very safe - which it wasn&#x27;t). When I realized that the rapids were overwhelming me, I tried to stay afloat (a flotation device and know-how of floating works - but I guess I was panicked!), but did not help too much. It took me sometime to realize I was drowning, and in the meantime I had told another raft that had approached to help - that I was fine (overconfidence?). When the reality hit, it was bad, and I could not even scream. I did wave my hands, on to which my friends on the raft threw a rope, and I survived.<p>Even swimmers (I consider myself below average) can drown. &quot;Panic&quot; is to blame here.

We have html markup for content, CSS for design, and JavaScript for interactivity. Problem solved. Now within front end development there are a number of other problems that need to be solved and that&#x27;s why we have these different front end resources. So we can use the tools that solved the problem of getting content on the screen to achieve certain more specific goals. Some of these resources solve the same problem in different ways and some are for niche problems. Either way the fact that these exist shows that front end technologies have done their job well. They&#x27;re versatile enough to handle a wide range of uses.<p>Front end tools aren&#x27;t perfect but that&#x27;s why they&#x27;ve been iterated upon. And what language doesn&#x27;t have shortcomings?

Where&#x27;s the mess you&#x27;re talking about? This is a common thing to say among non web devs but I never can get any specifics.

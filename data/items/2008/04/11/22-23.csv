I'm looking for a hacker and also a (perhaps separate) gregarious, people-friendly marketing/usability person. Please watch the screencast on the main page if you want some introductory info, and please keep in mind that the current site is a rough draft. I started coding Lonely Learner in my spare time a few months ago and I'm now going to start adding new features and increasing usability very fast. I have a list of (IMO, innovative) features that I plan on adding by the end of June, and I also plan on having a German version running by the end of July. At that point I plan on pitching the site to foreign language departments in high schools, colleges and universities. Ultimately, I want to make it plain to anyone learning a foreign language that they would be foolish to not use my site.<p>I am pretty smart and am one class shy of a degree in Economics with minors in CS and Math from the University of Chicago. I am a versatile maniac when it comes to coding and fiercely dedicated to making a successful start-up. I am working hard to overcome myself and carve out space for my imagination, to study my thoughts and reactions, and to solemnly search for the right combination of factors that will make my site successful.<p>Want to join me? Please contact me off-list.<p>Adam (bezeichnung)",1207953715

161441,comment,161194,161418,0,0,davidw,,,"Perhaps something like the Affero GPL would have been more appropriate in that case?  Maybe you have access to better legal advice than I do, but my reading of the GPL is that if you're not redistributing it, you're not required to give back your modifications, and I'm not sure that running mod_rails on your own servers counts as redistribution.  Perhaps you're simply aiming to stop people from selling binary-only versions, but that doesn't seem like nearly as likely a scenario as some hosting provider boasting of a mod_rails with extra secret sauce that they're not sharing.<p>I'm not a license zealot, and think they all have their places, but I should also say a word or two in favor of the BSD/Apache style licenses: in the Apache Software Foundation, we don't rely on licenses to ""keep people in line"" (in terms of proprietary forks), but a strong, diverse community that has the potential to outdevelop anyone who tries to make a proprietary fork.  They realize that if they fork, they're going to fall behind the community driven version, which is moving faster.  Of course, that's not possible in all cases, but I think that a potentially important project like mod_rails certainly has a good shot at attracting that kind of community.  You guys probably know more about the people in the rails hosting market than I do though, so maybe your fears are based on a concrete threat.",1207953169

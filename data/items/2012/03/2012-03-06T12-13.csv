3670771,comment,3669568,3670014,10,0,larsberg,,,"> deciding whether someone will fit in the Google clique<p>That can be shockingly important. You can be a great developer, but still not a good fit for a company. As an example, I saw several employees top-out at relatively low points at MSFT but then go to Google and have heard back that they have done shockingly well. I would bet that the reverse is also true.<p>Some of the best interviewers I've had on my loops were people who had a great grasp of whether a person was not only smart, but whether they would be successful long-term (e.g. if this entire division got killed, would they still do great work elsewhere in the company?).<p>While I can't characterize hire/no-hire decisions for old legal reasons, I can certainly say that many of the people who struggled at MSFT but excelled at Google favored closed-door remote-work style hacking over personal interaction code-design. One style is not necessarily better than the other, but for people who can only work in one mode or the other, they will find themselves career-limited in the long term if they go someplace that does not fit with their work style.",1331038542

Then to upgrade, if everything breaks, you can just delete your RVM directory and start from scratch again.<p>Of course, this brings with it a whole other can of worms, because then it's your responsibility for upgrading your libraries with the latest security-related fixes (which otherwise would have been updated with a simple ""aptitude safe-upgrade"", which can be a cronjob or something).

I've seen it and felt some of the dismal consequences. As a matter of fact, I still have to work with lots of those people that should have been filtered out in step 1. So yeah, I agree with the idea.<p>Having said that, his process, taken together, is ridiculously one-sided. The message it sends comes across as ""Of course you want to work for us, regardless of all the hassle we're putting you through, who wouldn't? Only someone out of their mind, that's who! And we don't want people like that here.""<p>Think about it, Jeff. You are asking for someone who:<p>1) is highly skilled<p>2) has an attractive portfolio<p>3) is mature enough to communicate well<p>A lot of people like that already have jobs. If you want them to do #5 -- which might be something they're forbidden by their current employment contract, by the way -- and you also want them to prepare a presentation for #6, you must be the sexiest employer on the Earth.<p>In short, what do you propose to balance things out?",1331035474

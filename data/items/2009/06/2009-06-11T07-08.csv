It seems like more of an anti-spam/swearing tool than anything likely to elevate the quality of discourse; that's useful enough in and of itself for quite a few sites though.<p>I do think it's fairly pricey. 15k messages/mo ain't much on a busy site. Some political blogs rack that up in a couple of days, but I don't see them putting down several thousand a month for crowd moderation.",1244706964

They share the same mouse and keyboard, so I can type or copy and paste between them. I'll typically do Web stuff on the Mac and e-mail and chat stuff on the PC.</i><p>What does this actually mean? A Mac with a virtualized Windows instance on one of the monitors?<p><i>I do my best stuff midmorning and superlate at night, from 1 to 5 in the morning. Some people don't need sleep. I actually do need sleep. I just sleep all the time. I'll catch naps in the afternoon, or I'll take a 20-minute snooze in the office -- just all the time. Our business is 24 hours.

I'm not a regular visitor, but at least 4chan doesn't pretend to be anything other than the filthy underbelly of the net, and the community there has both a sense of humor about itself and genuinely likes kittehs...plus it has the merit of being funny if you're willing to accept the possibility of being offended.<p>What's really depressing to me is going to visit the San Francisco Chronicle website, CNN or wherever, and seeing the comment space overrun by arrogant idiots who <i>think</i> they're superior to 4chan, or would if they knew about it.

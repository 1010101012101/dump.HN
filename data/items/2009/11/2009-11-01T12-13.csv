They are likely to screw it up, but at least they get the feedback of a bounced email.  There is a recovery mode, and it's their problem.<p>With an incorrectly spelled return address on a form there is no recovery mode at all, and they get no feedback that it hasn't worked.",1257077167

If you find yourself without ""traditional"" employment, I'd suggest busying yourself creating lasting value for yourself rather than just doing passive search for a job.<p>The typical send-letters-and-wait-by-the-phone game is for suckers.  For one, it doesn't really let you differentiate from the other 20% of your age group who don't have jobs.  (Your resume theoretically lets you, but no one really cares what is written on it.)  For another, everything that doesn't result in at least an interview is just wasted time.  If you spend 6 months writing and then get a job interview, you've now got an interview and <i>six months you will never get back</i> which did not add to your personal capital at all.<p>Instead, built something you can keep.  If you're a techy, write software.  (Heck, build an entire business.  You've got more than enough time.)  If you're not a techy, you have my sympathies, but at least get yourself a blog going and start writing like it is going out of style.  Set yourself up as the expert on your little patch of whatever and own the daylights out of it.  Then, use it to network.  Even if you can't get a job directly related to your niche, you can use the blog as an example of writing skill, communication skill, ability to carry tasks to completion, etc etc.<p>[Edited to add: It kills me that a sizable fraction of the best writing I've done in my life was a) on subjects I didn't really care about and b) will never be seen by anyone again, because I graduated from college many years before I heard of Dropbox.  Most intellectually engaged students produce vast, vast quantities of great writing on subjects of perhaps less-than-great importance because they're told to... and then stop writing after college.  Don't be most people -- most people's competitive situation sucks, because they have to compete with most people.]",1257077002

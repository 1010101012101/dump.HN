8889396,comment,8889151,8889151,0,0,Someone1234,,,"That is more badly done than it could have been.<p>However the articles primary complaints (that the pin is retrievable, and that the password database is recoverable) is always true no matter how well implemented it was. The entire concept of the application depends on Android&#x27;s file permissions to stop other apps looking at the database. Once apps bypass that security, recovering the passwords is an eventual inevitability.<p>The pin is likely just there to stop friends & family from accessing it. The same way Android&#x27;s pins and patterns aren&#x27;t really &quot;security features&quot; as much as to stop friends and family (and casual thieves).<p>So overall the article isn&#x27;t wrong, but even if the author fixes all of their complaints (and replaces DES with something actually secure), the app wouldn&#x27;t actually be much better because the same concepts are the backbone of the security.<p>This all boils down to the author&#x27;s decision to use a pin. If a four digit pin is the entire basis for security then it can never be made secure, even if it is hashed, even if it is encrypted, and so on. There&#x27;s no number of BCrypt factors you can set to make a four digit combination secure.<p>So for the author to make the app more secure they would have to require the user enters a long password, but I get the sense that isn&#x27;t their USP looking at their app page. Their USP is the fact it only requires a four digit pin, so therefore that is that.<p>The author could store the pin in a decent hash, and then encrypt the password database using e.g. AES256 but ultimately a four digit pin is a four digit pin. You cannot really fix that unless there is an actual hardware interlock (e.g. chip that checks the number and burns out after too many bad tries).",1421272429

8889392,comment,8886899,8888555,0,0,aetherson,,,"Well...  sort of.  But it&#x27;s probably more aptly a bicycle versus car analogy.<p>Like, suppose that originally there were 1,000,000 people who all owned PCs.  There are a few ways that could change:<p>a.  All of those people, or 950,000 of them or some other gigantic number of them, could give up their PCs and start to use a phone and/or tablet instead.  This is what you might call the naive death-of-the-PC scenario, in which the PC either disappears or becomes an unusual tool for specialists.<p>b.  500,000 of those people or somewhere in that vicinity give up their PCs and start to use a phone and/or tablet instead.  This is what you might call the realistic death-of-the-PC scenario -- the PC doesn&#x27;t disappear in any way disappear, but demand for it is permanently massively lower.<p>c.  Few people give up their PCs at all.  Instead, large numbers of them get phones/tablets in ADDITION to their PCs, and move some of the work they used to do on their PCs to their phones/tablets, but everyone or a large majority of everyone keeps their PCs and still do some work on them.  This is the rise of the smartphone without a corresponding fall of a PC.<p>I think that scenario C has turned out to be the reality.  Smartphones and tablets have replaced the PC heavily for some use cases, but have not replaced the actual device very commonly at all.  It&#x27;s somewhat unlike a car/truck tradeoff -- while some people need trucks, most people don&#x27;t, and have cars instead.  It&#x27;s more like a car/bicycle tradeoff -- most people who have bicycles, even ones who use their bicycles regularly, also have cars.",1421272399

One big result of giving college educations to a bunch of people that didn&#x27;t need them is the credentialism race.  Why does an office manager need a college degree when it didn&#x27;t 40 years ago?

8889383,comment,8884838,8885335,0,0,trevelyan,,,"Look, it&#x27;s sexy to complain about energy costs, but you are really underestimating the massive inefficiencies involved in the legacy payment system. Because even if bitcoin is less energy efficient in some technical sense, there are enormous efficiency gains it provides by inverting the structure of risk in the payments industry.<p>One of the first things you realize when you try to setup payment processing is that middlemen would not actually exist in the payment processing industry if it was an efficient market. But these companies do exist because the entire industry structure has developed to pass risk from credit card companies to intermediary businesses whose sole function is basically to manage risk and enforce policy compliance. It is a bit like if Google didn&#x27;t give email addresses to individuals because it couldn&#x27;t be bothered policing spam, so you got your email through a third party.<p>Anyway, even if we ignore the deadweight losses imposed on the economic system by all of the businesses which cannot get credit accounts (merchant accounts), the costs of supporting this credit-centric system are enormous. PCI compliance costs alone are staggering, and serve no purpose except to lower the risk held by credit card companies. And even with this, the inefficiency of central risk management is so great that VISA doesn&#x27;t even bother to investigate fraudulent purchases of less than 500 USD. And why should they when costs can simply be pushed back to merchants and turned into a profit center by issuing chargebacks.<p>And this is where bitcoin gets interesting -- by inverting the risk structure and letting anyone accept payments without the need for a payment processor to issue credit, Bitcoin eliminates entire horizontal swathes of the payments industry, while placing competitive pressure on legacy payment providers. If the technology scales to the point you are concerned about, it will decimate the number of people required to be employed managing risk in everyday transactions.<p>Put more succinctly, you need to shift from thinking about the energy costs of bitcoin as a wasted ongoing expense and start considering them the price of eliminating an otherwise intractable trust problem in finance. It is like paying for a standing firefighting force. Expensive in one way, but a lot cheaper than the alternative.",1421272329

That is a radical difference from previous evolutionary-biology which was a missconception about the evolution process in itself, the new neo-evolutionary theory is closer to reality.<p>The old evolution-theory is spread more than other scientific theories primarily because it has inferences onto politics, society and religion. It acts as a scientific narrative of life, most often the information spread is inaccurate according to the theory itself, but it&#x27;s primarily used to justify politics.<p>While the old evolution theory had inferences in beginning of 1900 of anti-race, anti-weakness and anti-homosexuality (nazi, racial-biology) after 1970 the inferences instead change to be pro-race, pro-homosexuality (homosexuality is created by evolution for a purpose instead of a error now). The interesting thing is that while the inferences from evolution theory changed, the theory itself was the same, it&#x27;s just the politics around it that change. Evolution theory is used to support politics as a contemporary narrative. You can pretty much justify anything by creating a purpose of why evolution wanted something to occur, like &quot;The evolution wants us to create babies and progress technology.&quot;, &quot;The evolution theory wants women to be better at hearing baby screams.&quot;<p>The new neo-evolution theory instead brings a whole range of new inferences. If the environment can change mutations and progress itself then environment becomes important. Inferences from the old theory was that people were predefined from birth by their biology and this became the basis for many sciences today like psychiatry. When the premises of other sciences become questioned, the sciences need to updated.<p>Without having a discussion about epistemology I think it&#x27;s impossible to understand the difference from fact, theory, hypothesis and truth. Just because predictions from a theory is true it doesn&#x27;t mean that the theory is the truth, it just means that it does accurate predictions. Most of scientific theories have been revised and it would be naive to think that neo-evolution theory is the definitive end definition about evolution.<p>If evolution-theory would be distributed without inferences on politics I don&#x27;t think it would be a hot topic at all",1421271578

If gigabit costs 10% more per mile than 100Mbit, is it worth it? Their burdens per person will be higher, in areas where the wage is typically lower. Perhaps 10Mbit wireless would be much cheaper per customer; maybe much more affordable for local residents (who have to pay through fees or taxes, one way or another).<p>Similar thing with septic versus sewer[0].

The owner had found old explosives on the surface, toxic materials inside. Everything other than the control room had asbestos. The elevator was broken, so he had put some lights down the stairwell with extension cords... but once at the bottom, you needed flashlights to get around. You ended up dressing up in hazmat suits just to look at the place. The ladders to get to the various levels in the power dome were steep, and navigating that part of the site in the dark, while it was full of old scrap metal and debris... definitely not safe. The control and power domes were dry, but the silos were partially flooded. That was 15 years ago, so I have no idea what has become of the place since that time.<p>I will say that looking at images and diagrams of these old sites does not really give you a perspective of their scope. The power dome was probably the largest single room I have ever been inside... and it was underground. The control dome had gaps on the edge, so you could look underneath and see these huge springs that held everything up, designed to stabilize it in case of an attack. It may have been a dangerous place, but still really cool to explore. I wouldn&#x27;t go in without the owners, though - even though most of these can be broken into, if you got hurt down there, that would be serious trouble.<p>Even if you can purchase these properties cheaply, there is still a lot of work to do, and it is more than most people can really handle.

There is a lot bigger investment required in terms of dedication, focus and effort, but I don&#x27;t think the constraint is monetary.<p>If the government picks up what little monetary cost isn&#x27;t already picked up by the state or other groups, this will certainly attract some students to attend but I imagine those marginal students would be a lot less serious and would not benefit from the program. To paraphrase Nassim Taleb, it&#x27;s always helpful to have some skin in the game.<p>An interesting statistic to look at is college completion rates [0][1] which haven&#x27;t improved too much over the last few decades (although certainly on the way up for women).

In the era of the $10 cell phone camera module, there&#x27;s no reason to have one without a vision system. You design some fiducial marks on the board, and the vision system goes looking for them to get precision alignment. This makes up for small errors in the board position.  When putting down a part, the vision system matches up the expected pattern of pads with what it sees and fine-tunes the position. This is easier than trying to hold everything so rigid that blind placement works.  A vision system also lets you check that you picked up a part properly from the feeder, and that it&#x27;s in place properly after placement.<p>Your little assembly line is then a pick and place machine, a solder-paste dispensing machine, and a reflow oven, which can be a toaster oven with precision temperature controls.

A town near me, Olds, just rolled out gigabit fiber to the curb for $57/mo.<p>I do wonder if Olds is just covering their costs (likely) or are turning a profit (unlikely) (most municipal initiatives I&#x27;ve seen aimed to provide bandwidth at cost)?<p>The infrastructure is new and shiny now, and works well, but in 15 years what will it look like? Most state highways systems are in atrocious condition, let alone federal interstates. If the municipal is not turning a profit (even a slight one), there might not be incentive/budget to continuously upgrade the infrastructure as new technology becomes available.<p>I think I would prefer a system in-which municipals lay and operate fiber throughout the city, but don&#x27;t connect to the end users -- instead leaving that up to small ISP&#x27;s to make the final termination and provide bandwidth (pay for the upstream, etc). This way the fiber can be available to a greater many small ISP&#x27;s and give them a good footing to compete with the BIG5 and more, while simultaneously providing an incentive to keep the infrastructure current (better than the small ISP&#x27;s could lay themselves and upgrades paid for by leasing fees from downstream).<p>Something along those lines would spur small business (small ISP) growth while forcing the BIG5 to play more fair since consumers would have a significantly larger selection of ISP&#x27;s in a relatively short time.",1421269918

Sure, we can change the law, but we would have regulations in place that could interfere with the government entering the market, we might have gotten the big providers to agree to stricter rules if we promised never to try municipal broadband.  This could be a perfect storm for conservatives, because they can wave their arms about how &quot;liberals&quot; are always asking for regulation and now that a &quot;liberal industry&quot; is regulated we don&#x27;t like it and blah blah.<p>I far prefer to just obsolete the big providers and to implement internet as a real public utility.  Even if private companies end up contracted to provide it in some cases, those would be regulated monopolies, not regulated free market businesses.<p>I <i>far</i> prefer that we build the case that even a city&#x27;s own infrastructure would unlikely work without the internet, and that they should have at least some infrastructure that does not rely on commercial providers.<p>San Francisco&#x27;s water power plant on the Russian River is a great example of this, it provides power for muni trains and electrified buses, maybe _some_ streetlights and a few other public things.

The WHO and FAO meta studies have shown directly contrasting impacts of sugar in refined and unrefined forms[66] and since most studies do not use a population that do not consume any &quot;free sugars&quot; at all, the baseline is effectively flawed. Hence, there are articles such as Consumer Reports on Health that stated in 2008, &quot;Some of the supposed dietary dangers of sugar have been overblown. Many studies have debunked the idea that it causes hyperactivity, for example.<p>> Studies on the link between sugars and diabetes are inconclusive, with some suggesting that eating excessive amounts of sugar does not increase the risk of diabetes, although the extra calories from consuming large amounts of sugar can lead to obesity, which may itself increase the risk of developing this metabolic disease.<p>So there is definitely controversy, and to call me jaw droppingly ignorant is pretty offensive.<p>The fact that you think I&#x27;m arguing green veggies and sugar are equally bad for people means you fundamentally did not understand what I was saying.

I had a lot of experience before and during college, and then just happened to fall into a remote job with a company that is completely remote when I graduated this past spring. I was intrigued by the idea of having no commute and working from home/wherever, but I&#x27;m finding that I don&#x27;t absorb as much information being remote as I have in my previous jobs. Work-related communication is great because my company works hard at that, but it&#x27;s all the other stuff that I don&#x27;t get when I&#x27;m not sitting near other developers - stuff like best practices, new technologies worth trying, active brainstorming, and development tools. Earlier this week my coworker mentioned a browser add-on he&#x27;d been using for 6 months that is incredibly useful to our job and I had never heard of it; I think if we were working in the same location then that tool would have been mentioned a lot sooner and everyone on the team would have been using it 6 months ago.<p>The ultimate goal as a fresh grad is to learn and absorb as much information as possible, as quickly as possible, and I think that working remotely hinders that.<p>Also as others have suggested, it&#x27;s important to find a mentor(s) when you&#x27;re a new grad, and that&#x27;s harder to do as a remote worker.",1421269415

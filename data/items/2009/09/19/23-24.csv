832480,comment,832363,832363,0,0,sachinag,,,"There are a bunch of issues with the proposal, but hey:<p>#Let's say someone comes over, starts a company with $500K and it fails.  Then what?  Legally, they would have to leave at that point, right?  If not, why not?  Brad says no, they just have to found another company.  That makes me squeamish; while they may be working for themselves, it's not that different than bonding to a trade.<p>#How many founders can you bring over for one company?  What's going to stop them from setting up a consulting shop instead of a product company?  We've seen that consulting jobs are very clearly 1-to-1 displacement of American citizens.<p>#There are a lot of issues with the verification of ""bona fide founder"" status.  I get that VCs are OK with being gatekeepers (yeah, I plead guilty for my one year on the dark side), but it's really distasteful to hand over any part of immigration to non-government officials.  More here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=556908"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=556908</a><p>#The pro arguments now are based on anecdotes, not data.  There is no data on how many jobs we're ""losing out on"" by not having a more founder-friendly immigration system.<p>#Lastly, there's a solution that works right now: find an American co-founder.  It's not pretty, as you have a distributed company in the early days, but it works.<p>I acknowledge the intelligence of the tactical decision to give up on H1-Bs and go after changes to the EB-5, but America would <i>be a better place</i> if we actually reformed the H1-B process.  I do wish Brad, Eric, Dave, etc. would tackle the H1-B elephant in the room publicly.  We shouldn't be trying to steal startups from other countries; we should be trying to cultivate an environment where everyone here legally - citizens and immigrants on their path to citizenship - can start one and have it thrive.<p>Also, and everyone's heard me on this before - this group would do a lot more for startups if they channeled this energy into healthcare reform.  Job lock-in is real and affects many, many more potential startup founders than immigration policy.  VCs/investors from outside SF/NY (<i>cough</i> Brad Feld <i>cough</i> Josh Kopelman <i>cough</i>) would especially be credible, useful voices on a matter that's actually front and center right now.",1253404470

832477,comment,832363,832433,0,0,joe_the_user,,,"It saddens me to see so much effort put into this kind of proposal. I favor loosened immigration conditions but this is a poorly thought-out scheme that seeks to create private initiative via government intervention.<p>It doesn't just threaten to pollute the 'immigration space' with folks trying to seem like 'founders', it also pollutes the start-up space with these folks. If someone is 'creating jobs' with the goal of securing a VISA, they could put out ads (which real job seekers will try to answer), then hire only their friends, get the wages paid kicked mostly back to them and have a VISA pretty cheaply since they would get back a good proportion of their money.<p>Sure, you could have regulators looking for people who did stuff like this but it would get clunky and I'm sure folks could think of umpteen other schemes to get around this. I'm not a Austrian or free-market nut but I think the Austrian arguments are <i>most</i> plausible when governments try to micro-manage enterprises.<p>It would simpler to elimenate h1b's, skip the 'founders' and give N VISAs to individuals with documented skills and M to individuals who just pay a million dollars directly. That would bring skilled workers and investors here without a lot of falderal. If you wanted to make sure they were never unemployed, make them put up a bond.<p>And Taxi drivers can make up to $100K/year if they are committed (a lot of them work literally 24 hours/day). A beach-head in the States is worth a lot in many parts of the world since once you arrive you can bring your entire family. $100K for ten people to immigrate here is a good deal. It's not something I'm even opposed to <i>as such</i> - my father and ex-wife were both immigrants. In fact, the main thing I oppose is the way present system creates distortions which helps neither the economy nor the immigrants.",1253404390

832470,comment,832383,832435,0,0,daeken,,,"On the contrary.  Compilers written in a high-level language are at a distinct advantage: they're easier to optimize (significantly so), easier to debug, and support forms that are difficult to deal with in a low(er)-level language like C or C++.<p>I do compiler development every day, and I no longer touch low-level compilers.  Everything I write is Boo (for my OS), Ruby (for my startup -- by far my favorite language for compiler dev, despite not liking it in general), or Python.  As a result, I have far more maintainable code than the majority, and the code I output is incredibly well optimized.<p>Edit:  To clarify, by 'support forms that are difficult to deal with ...' I mean things like using a pure S-exp structure.  Rather than a traditional intermediary form, you can represent your compiler state as an S-exp and iteratively optimize and compile it.  Standardizing around a form like that, when it's easy to deal with, greatly simplifies code.  (This is actually the reason Ruby is my compiler language of choice these days.)",1253404157

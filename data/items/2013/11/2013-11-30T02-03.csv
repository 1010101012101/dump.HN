6822044,comment,6821999,6821999,25,0,5vforest,,,"Here&#x27;s a quick summary:<p>There&#x27;s a Rails design pattern where you send an AJAX request to your controller, and it returns a bunch of Javascript that gets eval&#x27;d by the page you&#x27;re on. This is used for say, infinite scroll. You&#x27;ll click the &#x27;load more&#x27; button, the server will render a partial containing your new records, and return something like:<p><pre><code>    $(&#x27;#itemsList&#x27;).append(&#x27;<li>My new item</li><li>another new item</li>&#x27;)\n</code></pre>\nSo guess what? This is susceptible to XSS-ish attacks.<p>Let&#x27;s imagine that instead of a simple list item, this request was returning some sensitive information or a CSRF token. (Egor points to various examples of this.) Normally, executing a GET request from an unauthorized domain will not be allowed because of CORS. This is what prevents me from instructing the users of my website to make an AJAX request to gmail.com, allowing me to see all of their emails.<p>But &quot;wait&quot;, you say, &quot;the content type of this request is application/javascript.&quot;<p>So open developer tools and type this: (using jQuery for conciseness)<p><pre><code>    $.ajax({\n      url: &#x27;https://basecamp.com/[BASECAMP_PROJECT_ID]/progress.js&#x27;, \n      dataType: &#x27;jsonp&#x27;\n    })\n</code></pre>\nAnd boom, you have a bunch of sensitive information about your Basecamp project, accessible via JSONP request from any domain.",1385779333

6822040,comment,6821792,6822017,4,0,yeukhon,,,"You don&#x27;t get it. For any casual browsing a graph means nothing. But for people putting a powerpoint together or doing hw or doing research this graph is useful. Imagine you get a comparison chart from your query (Google already does this for very very very limited comparison queries). If you get the raw data out of Wolframalpha that&#x27;s even better. Instead of having a data scientist to write code to get the graph or imputing this into excel or words to get a graph, let WA do it for you. Hey here is another idea for innovators: instead of screenshot a graph but don&#x27;t we have a graph importer in powerpoint?<p>We are just looking at 2D plot, there is nothing fancy about this graph but there are more fancy stuff you can build. A graph is a generic term in mathematics and I hope you know that. Why do we go through social graph and knowledge graph? Why not keep them behind a firewall? Why bother building a JS interpreter in Go? If you can build a machine that can compute anything (universal turning machine, well, I know there are NP problems but we can do our best to compute a subset of the computable - approximation), you can do a lot of crazy things. I think WA is nailing down how the future of computing in relation to life is going to be. Ask a question and gives you back the data to you in both representational and raw form.<p>Here are examples:<p><a href=\"http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Who+is+Mozilla%3F\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Who+is+Mozilla%3F</a><p><a href=\"http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Who+is+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%3F\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Who+is+https%3A%2F%2Fne...</a><p>If somehow we can contribute to WA&#x27;s modules (we write our custom programs and WA can adopt them by means of marketplace - select to use this module, for example), then we can utilize WA powerful machinery to do our query and benefit the mass. This is where Open Source can make a big difference! Sure APIs are nice but you know, not everyone has time to manage another new website. If we can get paid to write modules and get commission share based on the number of users ... So on top of API, direct module marketplace IMHO is the game changing. This is why I like Google App Script and App Engine.<p><a href=\"http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Who+is+Facebook%3F\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Who+is+Facebook%3F</a>",1385779215

It seems more to explain why Go doesn&#x27;t have C++-style classes.<p>In fact, this quote is almost like hearing the concept of metaprogramming being dismissed because C macros are a disaster.<p>> To be fair he was probably saying in his own way that he really liked what the STL does for him in C++<p>The C++ STL is hardly the ambassador of type theoretic solutions to problems of software complexity and safety.<p>> What it says is that he finds writing containers like lists of ints and maps of strings an unbearable burden.<p>Writing things <i>once</i> is not the problem. If you want to write a red-black tree of inegers, you don&#x27;t want to write the whole thing again for some other totally ordered type. So you&#x27;re left with casting your way out of the problem on top of a boxed implementation. Great, you&#x27;ve sacrificed DRY for safety and readability because a rich type system was too hard [1]. Note: almost wrote &quot;proper type system&quot;.<p>> Perhaps I&#x27;m a philistine about types but I&#x27;ve never found that model particularly expressive.<p>Or perhaps Rob Pike just hasn&#x27;t explored the relevant literature in enough depth. At one point he admitted that he didn&#x27;t know that structural typing had already been invented previously! This isn&#x27;t to criticize Rob, I find his talks fascinating, I think he&#x27;s awesome, he&#x27;s a friend of my boss, etc. But he&#x27;s hardly the first hard-core hacker to be ignorant of the degree to which type theory has seen dramatic advances since the 1980s.<p>Just think of John Carmack, who after a very long and successful career using C and C++ is <i>only now</i> beginning to espouse the benefits of rich type systems and static analysis, going as far as to rewrite Wolfenstein 3D in Haskell.<p>> Type hierarchies are just taxonomy.<p>Here is the crux of the problem. Rob has silently switched from the ideal of &quot;generic types&quot; -- which 20 years of programming language research has taught us requires engaging with ideas like type classes, higher-kinded types, type covariance, and algebraic data types -- to the straw-man of &quot;type hierarchies&quot;. Of <i>course</i> type hierarchies are crap. But that doesn&#x27;t mean you have to return to the stone age.<p>Okay, well, structural typing isn&#x27;t the stone age, but it&#x27;s the beginning of the journey, not the end.<p>[1] to be fair, it <i>is</i> hard, Rust is still struggling to make the right balances, as Niko Matsakis&#x27;s blog posts so entertainingly demonstrate.",1385778595

This has enabled the construction of a library with operators similar to Go&#x27;s Communicating Sequential Processes [Hoare 1978].<p>What is different about Clojure&#x27;s implementation is that no changes to the compiler were required - &#x27;deep walking macros&#x27; (<a href=\"http://blog.fogus.me/2013/07/17/an-introduction-to-deep-code-walking-macros-with-clojure/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.fogus.me/2013/07/17/an-introduction-to-deep-code...</a>) were used - that actually restructure the code.<p>The benefit of this in the library is that when a process is blocked, the wait is converted to data and the thread is freed up and returned to the pool. You can have multiple processes talking to each other with a thread-pool size of one. (And still reason about the code in a neat way).<p>The benefit of this comes in the JavaScript environment, (via ClojureScript) where you can compile code that you would ordinarily coordinate with threads using CSP.

We probably should learn from Russia/India/Korea/China, where it&#x27;s almost impossible for students to pass STEM exams with mere memorization. Not that their exams are hard. It&#x27;s just that their educators take effort to make sure the problems in their exams encourage intuitive understanding, original thinking, and creative problem solving.

It&#x27;s great if you need the real-time steaming or a very performant web app but otherwise the lack of scaffolding and other features will really slow you down.

For instance, you need to write your own authentication layer, Play doesn&#x27;t provide one.<p>OTOH, I was able to write a real-time cluster monitor in Play for our Akka-based backend and the streaming component took less time to write than the setting up the app—it&#x27;s that straightforward.<p>IMO, if you need them, Play&#x27;s other features more than make up for its less polished aspects and I fully expect those to get fixed in time, especially now that Typesafe has brought Play under its wing.",1385777845

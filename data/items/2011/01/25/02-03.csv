You can't just stare at their brain and hope to find a six-pack in all those folds. It's easy to tell how physically fit someone is. You can make people run laps, lift things, take their physical measurements, etc.<p>But for determining someone's mental fitness, you pretty much have to interview them. It it's hard to do a good job of it, since it's like running backwards in front of the person, egging them to go faster. You have to be in pretty good shape yourself to be a good interviewer.""",1295924366

In some companies there's only one person who fills both roles but they are two distinct roles and I think this article refers to the actual System Administration role rather than the management role that selects software and vendors.<p>2.  While I don't think the System Administrator role will disappear completely I do think the focus will switch from one that is more hardware driven to one that's more software/programming driven.  I think businesses will expect System Administrators to handle integrating their cloud based services into a comprehensive whole in the future rather than just making sure there's a network to carry data.  That's important because it will mean a dramatic shift in the required skill set.",1295924347

2137779,comment,2137494,2137494,0,0,rnemo,,,"Anecdote from a SysAdmin: I remember during the early 2000s there was a trend for a little while to scale down the IT department, and rely on corporate support, or use outside consulting firms, or other methods that involved keeping the payroll mostly free of such ""backroom"" types. I've heard a lot of horror stories from people who would go into a company to fix a small problem or perform an upgrade, and would find virus ridden computers barely running, people doing ridiculous things like burning cds to move a couple of files (remember, early 2000s here), people losing their product license or support information, or other terrible things, simply because there was no on-site sysadmin to keep all of their computers in good functional order.<p>This article presents much the same scenario, but updated for 2011. And make no mistake, it will probably work for small, well managed, web-based companies, full of people that already know plenty about computers and technology. For pretty much every other type of major company though, there needs to be at least one person who's responsibility is making sure that the technology in the workplace can be worked with and not just worked around, and who can be responsible for dealing with the new technologies that come around, and until the cloud can provide such a service, the sysadmin will be alive and well.",1295924182

2137776,comment,2137025,2137025,0,0,jtbigwoo,,,"There are tons of bad managers, but there are also a few excellent managers.  I think it mostly depends on their focus.<p>Most middle managers (and most people in general) are focused on what they need to get done--the reports that need to be filed or the next status meeting to be scheduled.  What good managers realize is that their work contributes absolutely nothing to the company (directly.)  They are overhead in the purest sense of the word.  All those i's to dot and t's to cross don't add a single cent to revenue.  The only way they can make any contribution to the company is by making their people more effective.  A great manager should be a hacker focused on her people's time rather than on code.  She should be anticipating problems and annoyances and dealing with them before they blow up.  If there's a fire hose of distractions, she should be the valve that slows the flow down to a trickle and routes the real issues to the appropriate people.  Her goal should always be, ""How can I make my people 1% more efficient?""<p>Too bad that most managers appear to be little more than a secretary with a checklist.

You only care that it's not the license you prefer.<p>""The more likely scenario is that you start an open source project. Put it under the BSD. Great. Two years later someone comes and says, remember dev X, Y, and Z. They were using some GPL code in your project. We've found at least 50 instances of it.""<p>I've been an Open Source developer for more than a dozen years, on projects in use by millions of people, and under more than a dozen different licenses including BSD and GPL. Some of those projects span hundreds of thousands of lines of code and hundreds of contributors, in both purely commercial and purely non-profit organizations and everything in between. I've never once seen an incident of GPL code being accidentally used in a situation where it caused a license problem. I <i>have</i> seen people try to get away with not following the license, but that's not the same thing, and it was not a misunderstanding or inadvertent.<p>In short: He (or she) who writes the code, determines the license. Deal with it. If you're using the code it's <i>your</i> responsibility to understand the terms under which it is made available to you.

Just like the lower rungs of the value chain are getting eaten up in programming, the lower runs of the value chain in sysadminning are also getting eaten away.  Back when I was in middle school I was, I kid you not, routinely told that the comparables to my labor at HTML editing all charged $100+ an hour for making websites in Notepad.  (Complete with under construction signs.)<p>Thankfully, the state of the art has improved such that there are a variety of options for e.g. a church school to have a web page listing upcoming Christmas pageants without having to pay $10k a month on an ongoing basis for maintenance.<p>You know the old saw about competent sysadmen trying to write themselves out of jobs?  Well, don't look now, but in a lot of areas <i>they are winning</i>.  My old day job called me a Systems Engineer, which includes basic sysadminning, and over my very short career standard deployment practices for e.g. Rails apps have improved radically in a direction which requires me to spend far, far less work at this aspect of m job.  There are ""real companies"" on similar stacks who have server-to-admin ratios which just 10 years would have been unthinkable.  (100 to 1?  No problem.  It's really just 3-to-1 with heavy automation in play, anyhow.)<p>Sysadmen in the audience worried about their career prospects should probably try pushing themselves up the value chain.  There was once lots of value in babysitting cranky programs which blew up frequently in unpredictable ways.  That looks like it is changing.  Look at Exchange versus I-can't-believe-its-not-Gmail from the perspective of a firm with less than a thousand employees: heads you have someone whose full time job is to fight outages, tails you do not.

What was striking to me was how quickly the brain adapts to distortion in our visual field.<p>The prof would make students catch a ball with prisms before their eyes which shifted the image laterally. They would initially miss. But soon the students would adapt, and find nothing wrong with what they saw. These chages persisted. So when the prisms were removed, real world seemed shifted for a few minutes and they had difficulty navigating. Same with inverting lenses.<p>But what struck me most was that near the beginning of the course he demonstrated a curious case of visual adaptation and never mentioned it again till the end of the semester. At the end of the semester he showed the class that the student's brain had still not unlearned the distortion. Something related to  seeing colors. I do not remember clearly.<p>It will be great if some one can fills in the details. Particularly about the semester long, persistent adaptation.",1295923748

It would be interesting to know if David feels there exists an upper limit on the number of employees in order for a flat structure to work, and if so, what that number might be. Since large organizations, if they are designed well, are just a latticework of small organizations maybe it's possible there is no upper limit.<p>Regarding David's larger point I would add that having a boss tends to make people feel slavish and subservient to a certain extent. This creates an unhealthy work environment compared to the ideal in which all employees are truly on equal footing as regards power.

Second, co-ops constitute a very large percentage of the purchasable housing in Manhattan (and in some of the outer boroughs as well). Nearly all co-ops subject you to a very invasive board approval process where you need to reveal everything there is to know about your income and assets. They want to know that you're making more than enough money to meet your expenses and that you have sufficient reserves to cover yourself through any period of hardship. Co-ops also usually require a sizable down payment (almost always at least 20%, sometimes even 100%). If you seem risky, you don't get in.

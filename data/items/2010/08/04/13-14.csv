For example, on the read side you can ignore read events when you are not interested in reading. When you switch back to read interest, you can read the socket to see if data arrived while you ignored events.  A similar strategy can be used on the write side.",1280930398

Don't fall into the trap of going into college thinking you are going to double major in X, Y and get a minor in Z. It isn't high school anymore, so take classes you are interested in or you think will add some value to your life and adapt to the structure of a degree program over time.

Therefore, it is beneficial to count the grains of sand on a beach.<p>Point: not all activities that develop grit are beneficial. The implication of the grit argument is that <i>any</i> tedious activity has some benefit - if not for anything else, then at least for the development of 'grit' itself.

For a start the widespread availability of high quality digital cameras has eliminated a lot of barriers to entry for hobbyists who want to go pro.  (Many pros compensate with a lot of snobbery for the upstarts - which may be part of his story.)  A second problem is that it is now easy for anyone who gets a digital version of an image to print acceptably good photographic products from it fairly cheaply.  Which changes customer expectations about how much you can charge for those products.  This has resulted in a lot of challenges to traditional ways of doing photography, and traditional business models.<p>Because of this I wouldn't worry too much about his hobbyist versus pro issue, it is less important in the bigger scheme of things.  Figure out how you hope to survive and thrive given the bigger picture of what is happening to everyone in that industry.<p>Besides from your point of view hobbyists are great initial beta testers.  They are more likely to be forgiving of issues, and are more likely to have spare time to spend on figuring out your offering and giving you feedback on it.  Eventually you need to get into the pro market.

These tags <i>should not be treated as characters</i> as the mirror character described in the article obviously is. And finally, display routines would easily be able to indicate what's what; any sections of the string with tags indicating an alternate encoding could be displayed with bold, highlight, or in a different color. (ie. As in ""ti<cryllic>a</cryllic>n<cryllic>a</cryllic>nmen square"", except the tags would simply be unused bit-patterns.)<p>To accomplish the same thing with a Unicode string, one would have to store a list of ranges of code-points which correspond to the string's locale. Then, anything which isn't in one of those ranges could be displayed in the alternate color. (ie. A character outside of the range 32-126 would be considered ""not EN-US"". For other languages, the code-point ranges might be more complex.)<p>The scheme I suggested isn't great, but it would avoids having to compare each character to see if it falls somewhere in a list of ranges for the current locale.",1280927755

Maybe the authors just assume everyone can infer that every decision has tradeoffs and there's no need to discuss them in depth for this particular case, or maybe—and the nature of the blogosphere leaves me inclined to think that this is the case—most of those authors never consciously thought about those tradeoffs because epoll happens to be a good fit for their particular problem.

But this is just a wide generalization, made by folks trying to find patterns. Startups happen in Silicon Valley, by teams of young 20-somethings with more dreams than brains. Most fail, and some change the world.<p>But there are a lot of guys making money trading collectible buttons on E-bay or some such.

You know the ropes (hopefully), you're more likely to be playing a safer game, you're going to leverage. Also, oddly enough, under 17 or so is probably single-cofounder territory also.<p>I can't get past the enormous opportunities colleges offer to get to know closely a group of people over several years. These relationships can be invaluable with startups.<p>But I think that the conventional wisdom that startups have some certain shape or fit comes a lot more from the social nature of the startup community. VCs and the other hangers-on are always trying to make generalizations, always looking for boxes to put people in. How many single-founder startups are out there, bootstrapping, running under the radar, doing very well? Probably ten for every hotshot team that gets funded.<p>That's just a guess, and my opinion, and my opinion doesn't matter. If the sole-founder movement is true, it'll happen with or without us encouraging or acknowledging it. And if it's not true, no amount of pontificating and blustering will make it so.<p>But I'd bet on it.",1280926937

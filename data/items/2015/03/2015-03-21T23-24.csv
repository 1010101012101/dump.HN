Meditation is just training to do that regardless of circumstances.<p>edit: Also, this part is really just personal opinion: I think the other part of it is you begin to see that it&#x27;s possible to be content with less than you previously believed was required (because you enter a state of contentment just by sitting each morning, even if, e.g., you don&#x27;t have as much money as you&#x27;d like, or you&#x27;re having relationship trouble, or you don&#x27;t like your self-image—whatever.), and this starts impacting your outlook on life: you start valuing experience more and evaluations of aspects of your condition less.",1426982302

One is certainly pride (even if they wanted to, Intel can&#x27;t simply back down after promoting that stuff for 15 years without losing face). It also doesn&#x27;t help that the only realistic existing alternative for an OS-facing API remains BIOS (because OpenFirmware never really existed on x86 outside laptop.org), which has its own set of issues (even if they are all patchable with enough effort).",1426982270

9244807,comment,9244736,9244736,0,0,gvilarino,,,"I want to stress the point that there&#x27;s no tool that suits every problem; there are just different tools for different problems. If you only know how to use a hammer, then everything will look like a nail.<p>That been said:<p>I&#x27;ve developed in .net for a long time and, even if I totally respect what they&#x27;ve been doing lately with open-sourcing the framework and more recently msbuild, I honestly think their approach isn&#x27;t up to date for most scenarios you&#x27;d want to address nowadays.<p>If I&#x27;d have to choose specific languages for specific scenarios, I&#x27;d say that today, IMHO, a reasonable approach would be:<p>Web/desktop consumer-facing apps: MEAN stack is probably the smartest choice because it favors development speed and UX iteration. I can&#x27;t stress how beneficial is for teams to be able to write any part of the app using the same language. Especially for startups where teams are usually small: having everyone being able to develop any aspect of the application (frontend, backend, DB acces, etc.) is a pro I&#x27;d favor above many others. On top of that, the community is thriving and most stuff you&#x27;d need has probably already been developed or there&#x27;s a framework for that.<p>Backend-only/APIs/devops: Go seems to be picking up quite the hype in this space. Even if I haven&#x27;t tried it a lot myself, the fact that something as powerful and solid as Docker relies entirely on Go can say a lot about its benefits. Other possible choices would definetely be among Ruby or Scala+Play. I feel Java and .Net have become a bit cumbersome for this.<p>Micro-controllers/drivers/hardware-specific: so if you&#x27;re doing drone-related software or stuff for IoT or robotics (Arduino, Beacon, Raspberry Pi, etc.) a very valid choice will be plain C. Of course we&#x27;re talking about a universe of problems that come with unmanaged code, but when you go deep down to perfomance needs, it&#x27;s pretty hard to beat well-developed C software. I do know stuff has been made with Javascript and Node on the robotics front, but I don&#x27;t know a lot about it.",1426982236

If you are just getting started, and you want to keep costs low or you don&#x27;t have enough demand to justify buying hardware or building data centers, the cloud is perfect. This is the Uhaul stage, where you only move once every few years, so it makes sense to rent.<p>As you grow you might find that you were starting and stopping servers all the time to match demand or for batch processes, but you keep 100 servers on all the time. Or it could be that you want specific hardware that the cloud providers don&#x27;t have (e.g. a specific CPU or drive). It might make sense to move these to purchased hardware to keep costs low or get the exact hardware you need, but remember that you&#x27;ll have to deal with buying new hardware when it gets old or fails, and buying additional hardware to scale.

About four months ago, I found Ashtanga yoga, and to say that it has changed my life is an understatement. Mentally, I have reawakened. I now think patiently and deliberately with a discipline and focus I&#x27;ve never experienced. A child-like enthusiasm about the world, despite its suffering and strife, relit within me: hope and faith abounds. Occasionally, of course, I still do struggle, but I struggle in peace and with confidence. The physical changes have been equally striking. I&#x27;ve always had poor posture, mild scoliosis, and a hip imbalance. Now, that&#x27;s all gone: my posture is remarkable and effortless, and I carry a sense of self with every step. I also kick way more ass at CrossFit than ever. ;) Unlike most other yoga, Ashtanga intensely focuses on the breath as well, which has increased my aerobic capacity dramatically.<p>I&#x27;m of the opinion that meditation alone lacks the mind-body dynamic of Ashtanga yoga. Ashtanga trains you to stay focused, keep calm, and breathe deeply despite the intense (and sometimes painful) physical practice. The physical aspect is also a beautiful reminder that mental and physical transformation takes patience and time. Struggles with  strength, endurance, and flexibility serve as a tangible marker of one&#x27;s progress and the work that remains. Gauging the progress of one&#x27;s mind is insidiously difficult, particularly because you&#x27;re using the very thing your trying to fix to measure it! Also, if you&#x27;re restless like me, the postures will keep just enough of your mind occupied to allow yourself to explore yoga&#x27;s meditative aspects.<p>Ashtanga is my answer to David Foster Wallace&#x27;s remarkable speech, &quot;This Is Water&quot;.[0] The mind is indeed an &quot;excellent servant&quot;, and I can proudly say that I am its master.<p>Fun fact: When Sri Pattabhi Jois, a great Ashtanga guru, was asked by a student asked him why he would not teach him &quot;meditation&quot;, he is said to have replied: &quot;mad-attention&quot;.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhhC_N6Bm_s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhhC_N6Bm_s</a>, <a href=""http://www.metastatic.org/text/This%20is%20Water.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metastatic.org/text/This%20is%20Water.pdf</a>",1426981417

It has no competition to the west until you reach Houston (and even that is mostly specific to the energy industry).  It faces only mild competition from the Research Triangle region of North Carolina, and beyond that it&#x27;s a technology DMZ all the way to Chicago or the northeast.<p>It&#x27;s home to Georgia Tech, perennially one of the top 5 engineering schools in the nation, and pumps out thousands of new programmers per year in addition to the thousands who migrate here.  It has a highly diverse business base, not tied to any one predominant industry, and its Buckhead and Midtown districts have one of the most thriving startup scenes that you&#x27;ll find outside of SV or NY.<p>Of course, if a Georgia Tech grad is in the uppermost percentiles, then odds are he or she would be enticed by Google, or a west coast startup.  I&#x27;m certainly not saying that Atlanta is in the same league as San Francisco, or even New York (at least not its finance/quant opportunities).  But my earlier point was that these environments are extreme outliers, and virtually no other city is comparable to that either.",1426980752

(It would take a long time to explain. Suffice to say that I am chronically ill, and if I were healthier, I could probably meditate longer without these vague negative consequences.)<p>Usually I set a timer (about which more below) for 2 minutes, then right after that, 2 minutes more.  If I ever &quot;flunk&quot; a meditation session, I take that as a strong sign that my mind is not working as well as it should be, and I try to fix that.  It is also a sign that more meditation is needed on that day.<p>&quot;Flunking&quot; a meditation session means I got distracted and forgot that I was supposed to be meditating.  For example, recently, some of my neighbors were having an animated conversation in the courtyard of my apartment building, and I was feeling lonely, so I went out there to participate. When I returned to my computer (I meditate in front of my computer) there was a some text on my screen put there by my meditation timer (which I wrote, in Emacs Lisp) which is how I became aware that I had flunked a meditation session.<p>More detail: at the scheduled end of a meditation session, an Emacs timer inserts &quot;Timer finished: meditation &quot; into an Emacs buffer visiting a file that serves as a record of my meditation sessions. (Emacs also automatically inserts the time and duration of every session into this file.) Since at the end of a meditation session, I am in the habit of adding the letter &quot;s&quot; (for &quot;success&quot;) to the text, the presence of an instance of &quot;Timer finished: meditation &quot; not followed by &quot;s&quot; was a sure sign that I had flunked the session.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing these short meditation sessions with my &quot;timer&quot; written in Emacs Lisp since Jan 2008. I do not do them regularly -- only when I remember to do so, which (a quick look at my files reveals) was on 7 of the last 30 days.<p>I do not have unequivocal evidence that meditation does me any good.

Look me up on your next trip!<p>Again, I think that the easiest way to think about Judaism is as a mix of nation and religion.  You can&#x27;t have one without the other, although for as long as Jews have been around (including Biblical times), people were pushing the limits on both fronts.<p>There have always been non-Jews living among Jews, who are sorta kinda included in the Jewish people but not completely.   And then you have Jews who don&#x27;t observe the religion, who are only really considered kicked out if they actively practice another religion.  And even then, if they renounce the new religion and return to Judaism, they&#x27;re welcomed back.<p>Why is Judaism based on the mother, rather than the father?  Because 2,000 years ago, that was an easy way to establish whether you belonged.  If the rules were being made today, perhaps DNA testing would be the rule, but we&#x27;re dealing with an ancient culture here that&#x27;s trying to mix old rules with new realities.<p>Would a gay teen from Tel Aviv have anything in common with the haredi (ultra-Orthodox) from Bnai Brak?  They might not agree on the interpretation of what it means to be Jewish, but I think that they would (perhaps reluctantly) see themselves as part of the same family.  Just because your weird uncle is weird doesn&#x27;t mean you disown him or stop talking to him; he&#x27;s still part of your family.<p>Indeed, I stand by my assertion that Jews, wherever they live, feel like a part of a big family.  But part of the family culture involves argument and debate, including over what is legitimately considered Jewish.  Throughout Jewish history, there has been major, multi-lateral push-pull dynamic among different groups, as well as among different rabbis.  And between popular sentiment and what rabbis allowed (or forbade).  People are supposed to listen to rabbis, but they often don&#x27;t.  And of course, it&#x27;s also common to say that you don&#x27;t like a particular rabbi&#x27;s ruling, but you have found a rabbi whose ruling is more to your liking.<p>Which is why you&#x27;re not supposed to go rabbi shopping in Judaism.  Which is why there&#x27;s the famous saying, &quot;If you don&#x27;t ask the rabbi, then the chicken is kosher.&quot;  (Meaning: Don&#x27;t ask a question if you don&#x27;t want to hear the answer.)<p>So Judaism is neither 100% people nor 100% religion.  It&#x27;s a mix of both, and you cannot separate them.<p>What has happened in Israel (where I live) is, I believe, a sad perversion of much of Jewish observance, in that you now have religious law handed political power -- a mix that&#x27;s toxic to both.  I&#x27;m convinced that one major reason why Israelis are so turned off to Judaism is that the people in charge have been so deaf to public interest and demands that people have turned off, or turned elsewhere.  It&#x27;s very sad for me to see so many Jewish Israelis think that Judaism is a primitive and stupid religion, when its very pluralistic nature means that people can and should find their own interpretations.<p>It&#x27;s true that Jews have always been fiercely argumentative and divided, while simultaneously remaining loosely united.  Much of the Jew-vs-Jew hatred that happens in Israel is an outgrowth of each group trying to impose its will, politically and legally, on the other.  Suddenly, whether you drive on the Sabbath is no longer a personal decision, but a national one, which inherently leads to debate.<p>And the imposition of people&#x27;s seating choices on airlines, and such?  I believe that this is a similar outgrowth of political and religious power, which has convinced some that absolute adherence to their legal interpretation takes priority over being a decent person.  Decency is supposed to be the #1 priority to someone who accepts Jewish law, and I see far too many examples of that not happening in Israel, I&#x27;m afraid.",1426979293

This allows you to compose (combine) functions into new, reusable functions. A powerful tool for programmers, and yet unfortunately we give it a name that often reminds us of curry the food and nothing else.<p>Can we stop calling it &quot;currying&quot; then and instead call it something meaningful? How about Argument-Deferred Functional Composition, or my preferred shorthand: argument deferral.<p>Obviously, the name &quot;currying&quot; and &quot;curried function&quot; is widespread, so it would be appropriate to say argument deferral (i.e., currying) or argument-deferred function (i.e., curried function).<p>Am I right to have a pet peeve about this, or should stop programming and go into marketing?",1426978826

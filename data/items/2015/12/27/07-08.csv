How do you reliably detect in dynamic analysis that Word has unpacked an executable if it doesn&#x27;t do anything?<p>Dynamic analysis for malware is a great idea but it can definitely be bypassed, usually very trivially. It comes down to the inherent complexity of the computer. There are a lot of ways to pack executables, and there are a lot of ways to make executables appear to not do anything malicious, so even if you use a full environment for dynamic testing it may not be easy to tell whether or not something bad has happened.<p>On the other hand, what&#x27;s being delivered does matter, and detection might be better if it had a real payload rather than a demonstration. A direct payload or a request for a second-stage binary are all things that dynamic or static antimalware systems can try to pick up.",1451202832

10796782,comment,10794026,10796353,0,0,munificent,,,"Not that I know of. There are a bunch of games that use &quot;arena allocators&quot; or &quot;per-frame allocators&quot;. Often, the game engine creates a bunch of objects during a frame of gameplay that it <i>knows</i> won&#x27;t be needed once that frame is done. There&#x27;s a clever strategy for managing that. When the game starts up, you allocate a big block of memory, the arena, and then set a pointer to the beginning of it.<p>To allocate an object, you just increment the pointer by the size of the object being allocated and return the previous value. In other words, you just hand out some bytes and move the pointer just past them.<p>When the frame is done, to &quot;free&quot; all of those objects... just reset the pointer. Done.<p>But, to your original question, it&#x27;s almost always a bad idea to run your GC every tick or some other high frequency like that. GCs spend a certain amount of time visiting objects that are still in use. Doing that work over and over and over again burns tons of cycles for no point. To get the best overall performance, you want to do as <i>few</i> GCs as possible to minimize that redundant work.<p>The problem then is that when you wait a long time, you end up having to a big, slow GC and long pauses like that are a problem. Incremental and concurrent GCs avoid long pauses and give you smoother results, at the expense of slightly lower overall performance. They get better latency but worse throughput.",1451202798

10796730,comment,10794502,10796206,0,0,mercurial,,,"I&#x27;m doing exactly that at work.<p>When you write React code (whether for a single-page React application or a mostly-legacy application), there is a point where you need to tell React to start rendering a root component inside a given, existing DOM element. Your legacy application should NOT mess with anything under this DOM element, as this will be solely managed by React. However, it is entirely possible to have several of these root components on the same HTML page. It makes it possible to refactor a complex page progressively. You&#x27;re still going to run into issues if you need communication between legacy and Reactified UI elements, though. You will need to setup, eg, listeners manually. In the case where you need to update parts of a form, just tell your React store to write to hidden input fields instead of doing Ajax with the server.",1451200351

10796728,comment,10794447,10796017,0,0,icefox,,,"Wait, why do you think that &quot;The market is big&quot;?  When you did customer validation it failed because the city wasn&#x27;t big enough.  And when you looked at bigger cities you found have better options than this idea.   That sounds like the market is actually not that big.<p>Even the premise seems a bit fuzzy: Can we deliver a pizza in 10-15 min instead of 1-2 hours?  Is the problem that it takes to long to deliver or that the delivery is so varied?  Maybe people cared much more about the time it is delivered than the speed?  If I am told the pizza will be here at 8pm and it arrives at 8:20 I am annoyed, but if I was told it would be here at 8:20 I might be perfectly happy.  The question to determine is are they losing sales because of speed or because of the accuracy of the last time they had a delivery?<p>But above the question based upon your existing research why not open a joint in the bay that sells high quality pizza delivered and $1 pizza if you walk in as that is clearly what the market is validating?",1451200290

10796721,comment,10795192,10796260,0,0,hamburglar,,,"The answers you get to this question are simply going to reflect the experiences and priorities of those who respond.  At various times in my life, I&#x27;d have either told you &quot;forget her; if you&#x27;re passionate about your job that&#x27;s what&#x27;s important&quot; or &quot;quit the job; if she&#x27;s special she&#x27;s worth saving.&quot;  Ignore it all.  You&#x27;re conflicted and the decision is going to be hard.  Girlfriends will often be more demanding of your time than you want them to be, and more critical of time spent on your job than they should be.  Conversely, employers will often push you to the point of neglecting your home life, to the detriment of your personal relationships.  There&#x27;s no one answer that&#x27;s going to tell you what to do in this situation.<p>But I can offer some observations based on your post:  If she&#x27;s pissed that you had to pay taxes due to your down round, that&#x27;s none of her business.  If she&#x27;s pissed that you&#x27;re neglecting your relationship in favor of a questionable business, it is.  If you&#x27;re carrying anxiety home, you better have a significant stake in the company or you&#x27;re jeopardizing your personal life for little gains.  Some might even argue that jeopardizing your personal life for <i>any</i> monetary gains is a dumb idea.  I prefer to stay somewhat agnostic on that one.  If things are so bad that you&#x27;re not having sex (but want to), something should change.<p>If I had to guess just based on what you&#x27;ve written, it sounds like the miserable part of your life is work, and if not for that, the relationship would be fine.  Down round, anxiety going home with you, paying very real taxes on something of not-very-real value?  These are work problems.  If getting your girlfriend back is really a priority and your work situation is as bad as you make it out to be, one very viable answer is to quit your job, then call your girlfriend and say &quot;I figured out that my work situation was the main impediment to having a good relationship with you.  I&#x27;d rather have you than some shitty job, so I&#x27;ve quit.  Please come back.&quot;  If the job really was the problem, this is guaranteed to work.<p>Note, of course, that if the job wasn&#x27;t the only problem, this won&#x27;t work.  But you&#x27;ve rid yourself of a shitty job and can move on.  Personally, I feel like girlfriends are harder to come by than jobs, so take this whole thing with a grain of salt. :)",1451200011

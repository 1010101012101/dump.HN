I'm sending more traffic over to the idot savants at I Can Has Cheezburger? And this isn't the first time, recently I had my entire office on that cursedly cute site. My boss was about to tape a page from another coworker's cat calendar to her office door. I told her about Cheezburger and the other lolcats/lolpets and we got the idea to each adopt a cat (or rabbit or guinea pig) and hang it on our office doors and guess what?\n",1185450998

I know it's possible, but in the machines I've had to do it on, it's definitely non-standard.  In those instances I've felt like I was back in the days of DOS.

1814452,comment,1811820,1812071,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Personally, I think deleting data like this--especially when the storage requirements are so tiny--is unforgivable.<p>I think the problem is that people haven't adjusted to the new ways of keeping data. They assume their free Yahoo account is theirs, the way their closet is theirs. You know, if you leave a box of pictures in your closet, it'll stay in your closet barring a catastrophe.<p>Online services are available to serve a certain set of goals and objectives. If those objectives change, your stuff might get thrown out. It's more like asking a hotel to let you keep a box of stuff behind the desk for a while than it is like your own closet. They might keep it for a really long time, but if the hotel changes management or remodels, your stuff could get tossed. Especially if you're not regularly staying at the hotel.<p>It's not even ""you get what you pay for,"" because paid services shut down too. In this era of cheap storage, there's no excuse to not make multiple backups of key data. Ideally at least one physical copy of important things. Actually print the emails out, put them in a binder, and put it in your closet. Keep one copy at Yahoo, one at another online backup service, one on your PC, and one on an external harddrive. That sounds like a lot, but it's not. Once you get a sensible backup policy and figure out what's important, it doesn't take very long to do backups.<p>It's a sad story you shared, but not unforgivable. Someone's keeping a box of your stuff behind the desk at a hotel. You can't count on that box to stay there. Now, the problem is people haven't realized that yet. But slowly, it'll become widely known and understood culturally. If it's important enough, keep multiple online and offline backups. Don't count on anyone to hold on to your stuff for you, because if management changes or the place gets remodeled, it might not be there any longer.",1287640473

They can fix a bug, but they can only fix it for themselves, not their customers who get Android through retail stores.<p>You may of course say ""Google has no obligation to let people contribute to their distribution"". And you'd be right. But this is like saying ""I am under no obligation to smile and say hello when you enter the elevator"". You'd be right. But people do it anyway because it makes the world a better place.<p>Likewise, Joe is saying it would be <i>nice</i> if Google allowed people to contribute directly to the main distribution of Android. They're under no obligation to do so, but it sure would be cool.<p>I hope this clears things up.<p><i>Full disclosure:</i> I work on Chrome at Google which has some of the features Joe is asking for in Android.

Thanks.<p>One of the things I don't understand is how the ACID properties carry over. InnoDB is fully transactional and ACID-compliant, but how does it manage this without the SQL locking that was slowing it down? Said another way, if the table/row locking overhead from SQL queries was such a problem, why is it in MySQL at all?<p>Also, the problems he identified don't seem like they should be problems. Shouldn't you be able to all but eliminate SQL parse costs with prepared statements? Why are his PK inserts and reads causing table locks (since Google tells me you can turn this off)? This strikes me as weird.",1287638618

I really think these types of tools need to be aligned with the type of team you have and the workflow you plan to use.  There are a dozen tools that will fit the bill on a feature breakdown.  With real-world use, with your team, with your project, with your environment, you'll discover a clear winner.<p>Some notes on products I've used, for reference:<p>FogBugz: A few years ago it was reasonably lightweight and decent.  It's gotten more complicated over the years and I couldn't stand it the last time I checked it out.<p>JIRA: The ""enterprise"" solution.  Infinitely flexible, with all the positive and negative aspects that go along with that.  Best API of all of them, though, IMHO.<p>Pivotal Tracker: I've used Pivotal several times over the years, and to be honest the UI is very cumbersome to use IMHO, and the density of features make it fairly heavyweight to use.<p>AgileZen: My personal all-time favorite for managing development projects. Fits a kanban-inspired mould, which I tend to like quite a bit.  JIRA offers a kanban-board view as well, BTW.<p>If I were you, I'd sign up for free accounts for all of these and use them for a week or so.  It's the best way to find out if you like how the tool operates and if your team will actually use it, which is more important than any specific feature.<p>I'd also take a second look at your requirements.  I wouldn't discount a SaaS tool for no reason. SCM integration (svn, git) can sound nice, but to be honest I've found that it adds too much friction to the commit workflow (to add a story ID or whatever) and is usually of little value).",1287637447

Is it that Apple gets no cut from publisher-sold ads, but Facebook Instant Articles only use Facebook ads?  Do either of these services have some sort of exclusivity clause (ala Youtube, where if you publish one place you have to publish to Youtube too)?<p>EDIT: it looks like Facebook Instant Articles also takes 0% of publisher-served ads [1].  So it looks like this Apple News push is merely an attempt to match Facebook&#x27;s product (and Wired screwed up messaging / accessibility here).<p>I&#x27;m still curious as to if anybody can add commentary / context from an advertising point of view.<p>IMO these events indicate a future where portals serve publisher content in a way that improves user experience (fewer ads, faster page load times) while the publishers catch up (rather than replace) their own native web experience.  Publishers will want to own their distribution if it does them well.  These plays (Apple, Facebook) may be less about poaching display dollars from Google than 1) cutting low-quality advertisers out of the network and 2) increasing hub engagement.  I doubt the hubs monopolize the market but I&#x27;m definitely no expert<p>[1] <a href=""https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/facebook-instantarticles/library/docs/FB_IA_FAQS.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/facebook-instantarti...</a>  LOL the FB site is running on wordpress ...",1442811422

This is basically a little bit disingenuous.<p>Today, most publications will use something like DoubleClick to manage their ads, sell a bunch directly to specific companies, setup bidding on some others via another provider hooked into the same system, and then use Google AdSense for the remnant inventory.<p>From my reading of it, on Apple News, you&#x27;re required to use iAd to manage the inventory.  iAd allows you to do direct sales through it&#x27;s own system.  And then all the rest are remnant and handled through iAd.  Apple locks out all other players from that large part of the ad market, including  Google.

Conversely they may provide a starting point for other researchers to look into something similar with potentially different results.  They may also be useful as part of the basis of meta-studies.<p>So the fact that no supporting evidence of a hypothesis was found certainly shouldn&#x27;t disqualify a paper from publication.<p>I also can&#x27;t see any reason why it&#x27;s relevant that their work primarily involved searching the internet.  They provided logical reasoning that if time travelers exist, it would potentially be possible to discover them through this technique.  Most likely time travelers don&#x27;t exist, and so they don&#x27;t expect to find anything, but that doesn&#x27;t make it worthless to try.

I&#x27;m guessing that they received more funding than the article stated - the regulatory process + setting up all the quality systems required is an easy way to burn cash, even if you are a smart lean savvy startup. Trying to fulfill the 510k submission could easily burn ~1 million even if they were lucky and smart.<p>For another thing, marketing costs in medical devices tend to by high because you need a lot of face time and networking. You often have to work through a lot of little different fiefdoms at every hospital/hospital network you want to sell at. It&#x27;s rare that you have a product whose technical advantages are so overwhelming that it &#x27;just sells itself&#x27;, as the majority of the medical field is in general pretty conservative. Incremental improvements to existing products are in many ways a much easier sell than any attempt to break a mold.<p>Since Shift does not have FDA clearance yet, then they are in fact legally not allowed to market in the US for human use. If that&#x27;s the case, then their marketing costs will naturally be lower.<p>That said, I have no idea how their veterinary sales/marketing work out.",1442808202

Even if you only do two levels, I believe you only cut the time in half, and you lose a lot of opportunity for compression if you do.

If you file a proper DMCA request than the provider must, ASAP, take the content down - regardless of if the content is actually infringing. This is to protect their &quot;safe harbor&quot; status to make sure the government doesn&#x27;t go after godaddy but rather the individual (rightfully so - godaddy doesn&#x27;t and shouldn&#x27;t control or monitor what users upload on their services). An example of it in use at github [1].<p>My sneaking suspicion is they either they didn&#x27;t actually send a DMCA takedown request or they filed it improperly. Or perhaps the owners of the sites sent a counter-notice which puts godaddy in the clear and forces these individuals to sue the site owners (if they wish to have the content removed).<p>> Can a commercial service monitor a given email address and keep track of breaches affecting that address?<p>I think there is a difference between &quot;here is a text box - enter your husband&#x27;s email to check if he is a cheater&quot; and &quot;we will alert you privately if your email is ever leaked&quot;.

I can and will adjust the wording, not only in this presentation, but also in my future descriptions of this model.<p>> &quot;But college also includes religious colleges, culinary college, ...&quot;<p>Good point. I assumed the term &quot;college&quot; was restricted to liberal arts colleges, some of which are religious. I don&#x27;t have any proof of that. In fact, these documents suggest that the Department of Labor defines colleges to include technical schools: <a href=""http://www2.ed.gov/students/prep/college/consumerinfo/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.ed.gov/students/prep/college/consumerinfo/index....</a> <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_definitions_edtrain.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_definitions_edtrain.pdf</a><p>However, this website suggests that the Department of Labor does distinguish between colleges and technical/career education: <a href=""https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ctes/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ctes/</a><p>> &quot;1) &quot;How many of those are going to something other than a &#x27;traditional&#x27; liberal arts college?&quot;<p>I&#x27;m no longer as sure of the answer to that as I was at the beginning of our conversation. I&#x27;m going to have to do further research and probably also ask the Department of Labor for clarification of how to interpret the information they have available.<p>> &quot;why focus on the differences to a liberal arts college, which is the most dissimilar to your proposal, instead of the more similar technical and vocational colleges?&quot;<p>There&#x27;s multiple reasons for this:<p>1.) Because my experience has been that liberal art colleges have far more credibility in the eyes of the general public than tech schools, art institutes, etc.<p>2.) Up until today, I was confident that liberal art colleges had a majority share of the postsecondary education market.<p>3.) My model was specifically created to disrupt liberal arts colleges.<p>> &quot;Why not just call that a &#x27;test&#x27;, and leave &#x27;standardized test&#x27; for its primary association?&quot;<p>Very well. I will adjust my future wording of this as well.<p>> &quot;Unless the external people are free to do whatever they want, they are being held to some standard, yes? Which is why they will get some (standardized) training in how to mentor students, yes?
Why do you think a standardized external adviser is more cost effective at providing the education that the student desires than standardized custom tests developed by the teachers for each course?&quot;<p>Okay, I feel like you just used the term &quot;standard/standardized&quot; with three different meanings.<p>I would like to reiterate that this model is built on the premise that the information that the student needs in order to obtain mastery is likely already available online in a format that the student can easily digest.<p>When I say that advisors &quot;advise&quot;, it&#x27;s not a euphemism for instruction or in-depth mentorship. Students are encouraged to learn all they can on their own, to &quot;bootstrap&quot; their education, if you will. Any instruction by someone connected to my institution is only to provided as a last resort.<p>Are advisors held to a standard? Yes, the standard of student satisfaction. Will that require some management of student expectations? Absolutely.<p>Are advisors provided standardized training? No. Advising best practices can not be expected to be standard across all industries.<p>Even the conceptual mastery interviews will not be standardized. They will most likely be structured, but the questions themselves will be unique to the student&#x27;s project.<p>--- Starbucks is closing.

Here's an idea: Can you use the information which tells you where a user came from to customize the site for him? So say I came from HN, I would probably like to see stuff about technology, startups, ect. with the option of checking out other categories.<p>If the origin in unknown/unclear, then a default page similar to Google News would be nice, in that it shows all the major categories and top 3 from each.<p>Definitely work on cleaning up the interface so it's easily readable/scanable. Most users don't like to and/or don't know how to hunt for information if it's not amazingly simple to find.<p>Good luck!",1222620713

317659,comment,317549,317549,0,0,jmtame,,,"I'm taking a Money, Media, and Power class that looks at the history of the United States since the 80s in great detail.  It considers how America has become extremely capitalistic, which isn't bad as long as open, competitive markets are encouraged.<p>What we've seen happen in history is the massive consolidation of companies.  Look at the media industry, for example.  It is now impossible to create your own TV network, and it will probably soon be impossible to compete freely on the Internet because the same conglomerates that dominate the cable and phone industry are trying to do the same thing with the Internet.  I have two words that can summarize the entire thing: network neutrality.  Complete deregulation is a bad idea; what happens if you take all the rules out of a football game?  Everyone will cheat.<p>How does this relate to the topic?  We don't like people who get their money for two reasons, in my opinion.  We don't like people who are anti-competitive, and who try to dominate markets (such as the Internet, cable, and television industries) and intentionally want to stifle innovation.  That's not contributing to society, and we all know that once a monopoly is established, a company has no incentive to innovate.<p>The other reason I personally dislike people with great wealth is because they're not being fiducially responsible.  If America is going to be more capitalistic, the people with the money should be driving innovation, not stifling it.  They need to act responsibly with their money, and that includes being philanthropic and charitable.  When they just hoard it all and it becomes a competition to see who can hold the biggest pot, I don't think you deserve to have it in the first place (think Elon Musk, and how much money he has invested into SpaceX and Tesla Motors).  What we have now is a massive gap in income disparity, and that's pissing off the lower and middle class.  It's actually driving the middle class out of existence, and I would say at that point the wealth isn't being distributed evenly enough.<p>That's my take on why we dislike wealthy people.  At least some of them.  As the article pointed out, I really do think some self-made rich individuals rightfully deserve it and are acting responsibly.",1222620284

317655,comment,317446,317634,0,0,iamwil,,,"From the link I posted:  \n""Based on our studies, it is clear that to produce the damascene patterns of a museum-quality wootz Damascus blade the smith would have to fulfill at least three requirements.<p>1) the wootz ingot would have to have come from an ore deposit that provided significant levels of certain trace elements, notably, Cr, Mo, Nb, Mn, or V. ...believe the blades with good patterns were only produced from wootz ingots made in southern India, apparently around Hyderabad.<p>2) ...wootz Damascus blades with good patterns are characterized by a high phosphorus level. This means that the ingots of these blades would be severely hot short, which explains why Breant's9 19th century smiths in Paris could not forge wootz ingots.<p>3) a smith who developed a heat-treatment technique that allowed the hot-short ingots to be forged might still not have learned how to produce the surface patterns, because they do not appear until the surface decarb region is ground off the blades; this grinding process is not a simple matter. ""<p>A combination of the right technology along with the right materials set the stage to allow trial and error to make incremental discoveries.<p>Besides, back then, there was a commercial need for swords, so people worked on it day and night for hundreds of years.  You can get pretty good at something when you work on it long enough.  Nowadays, our effort is put into semiconductors, among other things.<p>Maybe one day, when a new technology surpasses semiconductors is being used, and the 'art of semiconductors is lost', people of the future might wonder how we built things that were so damn small and hot with [yet unnamed or not understood physics effect].",1222619962

317650,story,,,2,2,mad44,"Comment on my 10^100 submission: Reddit on cellphones for geotagging interesting news ",,"Community voting (a la reddit) using cellphones to promote (and subsequently view) interesting news/stories within a vicinity<p>The news to be voted on are tied to a specific location and time.  You are allowed to upvote/downvote a news with your cellphone only when you are present in that location. The score of the news degrade with time, so news that have not been upvoted for some time fall below a threshold and disappear. Using your cellphone you can view the news in your vicinity, upvote/downvote/comment on the news, or submit a new piece of news [with picture]. The system uses karma to reduce the spam.<p>This idea allows local community news of interest to be disseminated quickly and efficiently. Students on campus can use this to promote club meetings, events, pickup soccer games. Customers can use this to rate vendors at bazaars, festivals, shopping malls. Tourists/hikers can use this to share hints with fellow tourists/hikers. Community organizers can use this to organize events. Craigslist functionality may also be implemented with this system.<p>A web service needs to be implemented to serve the news to each affixed locality. Cellphones need to implement localization preferably via GPS or based on celltower connectivity. Reddit like karma system and community voting should be implemented by the web service to reduce spamming effectively. To avoid privacy issues initially this system may need to be restricted to exclude residential areas; privacy and misuse issues need to be considered carefully.<p>Please evaluate. Also comment on other possible applications for this system.",1222619608

Why do you say it's not supported?<p>(Btw, it really sucks to go back and use languages that don't have hot code swapping.

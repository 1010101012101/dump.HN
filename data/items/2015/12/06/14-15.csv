10685377,comment,10684054,10684054,0,0,dmatthewson,,,"From the article, the CDC finds reduced landline use correlated with smoking and drinking, and thus poor health outcomes. There&#x27;s a sort of inference that one has to do with the other.<p>Many pay as you go cell plans can cost less than land plans, especially with all the taxes and fees. It&#x27;s a luxury to own both. Therefore poor people, who are more likely to smoke, are thus more likely to both smoke and have only a cell phone.<p>Regarding drinking the correlation is that people who only have a landline binge drink less. This is clearly because the tiny 8% that have land line only are mostly much older retired and rural people who just are not part of the cell phone generations. Binge drinking is correlated with youth and so this metric follows from age and not phone use.<p>Not having a land line does not cause people to smoke or drink, nor is not having a landline a dangerous daredevil maneuver. It&#x27;s an economic one. And having only a landline is a factor of age demographics.<p>In my own case I can certainly afford both but I only have a cell because the land line has constant heavy static making it useless for understanding speech, and since phone lines are now shared responsibility of many companies, none take responsibility for fixing them. Equipment falls apart and falls into disrepair. Service calls take weeks of calls to get done and the service personnel have to come in from out of state and are incompetent and incapable of fixing problems. As a result, no one in my entire area maintains their land line any more since none of our phone lines work.<p>It&#x27;s an infrastructure issue just like decaying and falling apart bridges. Cell reception just works and is cheaper. However my case and that of my neighbors, that of decaying infrastructure is possibly atypical or a minority reason for cell phone only use compared to the income and age reasons of others.",1449413811

Milwaukee used to be the only manufacturer, now everybody makes one, and in cordless versions too. It would be an interesting language study to analyze the construction and demolition domains to find out at what rate do people stop calling them Sawzalls, and how is this age or experience dependent?<p>And no, Googler, they&#x27;re rarely used for cutting regular logs. Green wood is likely to pinch the blade and cutting will be slow. That&#x27;s what chainsaws are for. Sawzalls are useful for two reasons: The blades are cheap, thin, flexible, and replaceable, so they&#x27;re ideal for demolition. Need to remove a sill plate that&#x27;s been nailed to the concrete? Push the sawzall blade under it and  cut the nails flush. Need to remove a header to resize a window or door? Just cut it with the sawzall. Also, the blade is short, so you can cut curves in thin material.  Need to cut a profile out of that installed gypsum board (language migration - was &quot;Drywall®&quot;) or cement board? Skip the hand saw and use the Reciprocating Saw/Sawzall.<p>What would be further interesting is at what rate do these trends appear and disappear in other, faster-moving domains - for example, Skype still has an advantage because some people use it as a generic word for video chat. How does this affect Apple, Google, Snapchat, WhatsApp, and other providers? How long does this last?

Also, nearly all electronic options exchanges have a &quot;mass quote&quot; feature that allows changes in prices over a large number instruments at the same time.  I would expect that this feature is available on every US exchange and only a few overseas exchanges lack it, and managing the generation of mass quotes vs exchange message rate limits is one of the more complicated parts of designing option quoting systems.  Finally, there is also a &quot;cancel by underlying&quot; feature that cancels all options on a specific underlying; if it is the case that the mass quote doesn&#x27;t allow quotes to be cancelled (i.e. modified to 0 size), then the usual approach is to cancel by underlying and then immediately requote at the new price level.",1449412854

Although I think the reason I&#x27;m getting downvoted isn&#x27;t for being unclear, but rather for shitting on people&#x27;s self-identities.<p>As for being ahead of my time, if you look at the job market today it&#x27;s true that you do have a lot of people paid purely for their ability to code. These are mostly W2 employees, who work at the kind of places where you start out as a junior developer making 60 - 80k, and then make double that after 8-10 years. And given the current state of society, this is actually a pretty good career path.<p>However, we also have consultants who bill on a project basis based on value rather than skill, who might easily make 400k a year even as junior developers. (E.g. c.f. patio11&#x27;s essays.) And we have entrepreneurs and founding team members who get paid largely in stock, the worth of which is largely determined by how much the market values the product.<p>It&#x27;s kind of weird because as an industry we definitely need people who have ridiculously good technical skills, to the exclusion of all else. But for the most part programming is a pink-collar job that just happens to be done mostly by men. (In that it requires education, but there is a lot of downward pressure on salaries because the people involved are perceived as being largely interchangeable.) This is why I&#x27;ll sometimes describe myself as a software developer, but never as a programmer or a software engineer.

But it largely happens inside the parties, rather than on the floor.<p>The wikipedia article on party discipline points out that in Westminster systems, the Executive branch is formed out of the Legislative branch. Consequently, inability to control votes in Parliament literally means you are no longer in government. Most MPs greatly prefer being in government than being in opposition, so there&#x27;s another inbuilt incentive to vote the party line.<p>In Australia&#x27;s Parliament each chamber is elected on a different system. The House of Representatives is single-member electorates. This means that one of the major parties typically forms a majority that can in turn form an executive government able to pass motions of confidence and supply. In short, to govern. Only twice has this failed to occur, leaving the governing party to rely on independents to form their majority.<p>The Senate, by contrast, is formed from a multi-member scheme with an electorate per state. There are 12 senators per state, half going to the polls at election time. In practice this means the majors capture the 2 of the top 4 spots each, one of the majors captures the 5th spot, but frequently a minor party wins the 6th spot.<p>This means there&#x27;s a mix of voices in the Senate. While a lot of legislation gets passed with the agreement of the majors, for anything contentious, the government will need to negotiate with the cross-benches.

Your perspective is more about &quot;don&#x27;t sell yourself short&quot; or &quot;don&#x27;t devalue your skills&quot;.<p>The gp&#x27;s perspective is more about the &quot;mystery of the universe&quot; as to why an enjoyable job could pay more than a boring one.  It&#x27;s a similar sentiment to the successful novelists, comedians, musicians saying, <i>&quot;I feel lucky that people pay me lots of money for doing what I love to do.&quot;</i>  (Yes, there are tons of programmers who suffer through boring CRUD coding and treat it as &quot;just a job&quot; but there are also many programmers who truly enjoy the activity.)<p>I experienced the gp&#x27;s perspective in my first job out of highschool.  I happened to be a decent typist so I got a job to transcribe audio to word processing documents.  One day, the business owner was looking at his screen in frustration trying to make something work.  I looked over his shoulder and saw things like &quot;DO WHILE&quot; and &quot;DEFINE PROCEDURE&quot; on the screen.  I just looked at it and then had one of those Jurassic Park moments[1].  I said, &quot;you need to set a variable here, and move that line there, etc etc.&quot;   He was totally surprised and said he&#x27;d pay me double the hourly rate if I could fix the computer program.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I had programmed computers during middle school (age 11 to 13) and treated the whole coding activity as &quot;playing with a toy&quot;.  I stopped programming during high school and worked at a fast food joint for minimum wage.  I had no idea that <i>people paid money</i> for programming.  People will pay me more for typing &quot;DO WHILE&quot; than mopping floors and hauling out grease buckets?!?  That&#x27;s absurd!<p>Yes, on one level, one can do all sorts of economic analysis (supply-vs-demand, marginal utility, productivity multiplier of software) and conclude that it makes perfect sense that programmers are paid $X more than brick layers.  However, even with that logical rationalization, there can still be this &quot;mystery&quot; of why a person typing on a keyboard in a pleasant air conditioned office makes more than a brick layer sweating in 100 degree heat.  It seems unfair that a &quot;game&quot; from my childhood earns more than back-breaking labor.<p>[1]<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFUlAQZB9Ng"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFUlAQZB9Ng</a>",1449412145

I had thought the greater freedom of Congressmen in the US to vote as they wished, even if it was against party lines, was strictly more democratic and therefore better, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s necessarily the case.<p>For a given issue raised, there are generally several distinct solutions proposed. These proposals have advantages and disadvantages, individually each is probably aligned with the ideology of one of the major parties, but let&#x27;s say it is not necessarily obvious that one proposal is strictly better than the other. There should be discussion and deliberation, but in the end a well-functioning government should pick one of these proposals and stick with it.<p>Without strict party discipline a party will have to lobby it&#x27;s own members and, since it&#x27;s generally trying to push through multiple proposals at once, choose its battles and compromise. As a consequence, rather than one of the well-thought out original proposals, a compromise combining elements from several is what will eventually be passed. While either proposal individually would work well, such a mixture can easily become an incoherent mess, and strictly worse than either individual original proposal.<p>With strict party discipline, the party decides in the party room what proposal to advocate, and then it expects party unity in pushing it through parliament.<p>It&#x27;s somewhat counter-intuitive, but I think that in many situations it&#x27;s more important that a coherent and well-considered decision is made than it is that all viewpoints and positions are accomodated.",1449411465

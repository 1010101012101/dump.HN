But I find it very hard to believe that FP is so much better than IP that it warrants talking down to the people using it.<p>> As I continue to learn more about them, so I continue to become a better programmer even in languages that don't exactly match the paradigms.<p>Agreed, and even while I definitely have not 'grokked' functional programming yet to the point where it would make sense for me to write some small utility in an FP language I can see how just learning about FP has influenced my coding style in other languages.<p>> Who knows what remains to be discovered or invented that will expand our thinking further.<p>Working on that :)<p>It's mostly a matter of constraints on this end, I probably took on more than I can handle in terms of work that simply needs doing and I hoped that through FP I would find some shortcut allowing me to become more productive. It has worked in a sense, some of the code I wrote for other projects has become more clean because of reading about and playing with FP, but in a concrete sense where I can substitute a functional language for an imperative one and get more mileage out of my days it hasn't (yet).<p>But I'm optimistic that one day it will, and as long as I can see it influence my thinking in a positive way I'll continue to study it.<p>One of the biggest eye openers so far was 'memoization', I'm not even sure that I understand it well enough to paraphrase it, but when looking at the source of hashlife it suddenly clicked: When you work in a functional way and you are guaranteed that there are no side effects stemming from lower layers you can <i>replace</i> the call to a function with a bunch of arguments, no matter how complex with its result. That literally blew my mind, even though in hindsight it is a blindingly obvious thing.<p>That such a 'small' thing as side effects could have such polluting effects on higher level code that a thing like memoization is impossible gave me a lot of energy to continue my 'quest' :)",1268603275

Just imagine how many folks interested in STEM want to take all those School of Education classes to get their teaching certificate.""</i><p>This was the best comment in the entire article.<p>When my wife and I were in grad school (math for her, applied math for me) we were both interested in teaching.  But the system put a lot of extra hurdles and disincentives in our way:<p>- Certification required an extra year and a half of lame classes, at great out-of-pocket expense.<p>- Teaching pays significantly less than engineering, and has less room for advancement and intellectual improvement.<p>- Teachers don't get a whole lot of respect from parents, students, or society in general.<p>- I spent some time in a public school classroom as a specialist, and was surprised by the lack of professionalism from teachers and administrators.  I had an administrator warn me that if I didn't hold specific political views, I'd get yelled at.  Sure enough, one teacher angrily demanded to know why I wasn't voting for her favorite candidate (though I'd never said anything to her about it -- that info was spread to her behind my back).  It was made very clear to me that I wasn't <i>personally</i> welcome in that environment.<p>- Teaching (at least in the public schools) is heavily unionized.  Advancement doesn't seem to be directly merit-based.  Seniority, politics, and being in with certain ""cliques"" seem to be important.<p>After grad school, I spent four years teaching STEM concepts for a museum with a large K-12 outreach program.  Based on teacher, parent, and student comments and on performance evaluations, I'm pretty sure I would have been a great classroom teacher.  But it simply wasn't worth the extra time, money, and effort to get a low-paying, low-advancement job in a politically hostile environment.",1268602750

Even now I have to pay a certain amount of attention to maintain my weight.  It just won't go on autopilot.  I'm still smart enough and knowledgeable enough, but it's a small constant drain on my energy to execute.<p>The drain on my energy is much lower now, but I was lucky to be able to devote so much time and energy to get to where I am now.  I was even unemployed for a significant amount of that time, which I could afford thanks to working in a pretty high-paying profession, and which was a big help in being able to focus on changing my lifestyle.

If you're doing your reads from slaved replicas, you've got an ""eventually consistent"" system (""A{possibly, P}""). If you're only doing reads from the master node, you're no longer highly available. If you're ""promoting"" slaves in the case of a master failing, you're _AT_ best back to the case of eventual consistency (if the master comes back and the replication backlog is replayed correctly) or you might not be consistent at all. To echo others, let's call this ""potential consistency"".<p>Eventual consistency isn't something Amazon decided to make up, we've dealt with eventually consistent systems on a daily basis long before (DNS, usenet, some distributed file systems, etc...).<p>BigTable and co. are not ""CP"" and much more true to the ""CA"" definition than say MySQL replication or Postgres + Slony. They use protocols like Paxos with leases (BigTable) and Zab (used by ZooKeeper based systems). These are modified 3PC protocols: unlike 2PC protocols, they still guarantee fault tolerance (""A"") even if the coordinator node fails; unlike pure 3PC protocols they offer certain guarantees of liveliness (e.g., through the use of leases) and even some degree of partition tolerance. Still, Google had to build Spanner on top of BigTable to provide partition tolerance / true multi-datacenter operation.",1268602096

It is important to know that any good implementation of functional data structures will allow you to do this in constant time & speed. (independent of the size of the data structure).<p>Editor combinators : If you arent aware of this & are modifying a data structure with several levels of nesting, imperative assignment will seem much more convenient, ie dont translate foo.bar[8]=3, into something of this pattern barNew = editVector(foo.bar, 8, 3), fooNew=editMap(foo, ""bar"", barNew). It gets worse with more levels. Instead,  use an editor-combinator library which will allow to you specify the path within the data-structure and a new value just as in the imperative case.<p>Things to know which are not strictly FP related, but nevertheless very useful - pattern matching simplifies definitions a lot, typeclasses are usually more convenient than class hierarchies.<p>Someone has already pointed out advice on libraries, (Clojure or any using any popular language in a functional way).<p>The main thing which motivates all of this - composability.

526993,comment,526849,526965,0,0,thwarted,,,"Agreed.  It takes maybe a half hour of experimenting to know enough of the syntax of a language to start being mildly productive, and the rest of the time is spent trying to learn the standard library and language specific idioms -- which can take years.  This is one reason why I've always found the PHP.net website to be useful, despite the fact that PHP has a significant number of serious warts.  Admittedly, it could use a lot of work, the comments are less than spectacular, and some of the things it suggests are downright dangerous, but it's an excellent reference for the list of functions, how to use a function, and often times <i>when</i> to use a function -- unlike many language intro <i>and</i> function reference works.  Let's say I want to do a DNS lookup.  The PHP docs for dns_get_record are overly complete, you're well on your way to starting to use that (the problem with PHP is deciding _which_ of the four or five functions that do the same thing you should use, not a walk in the park either, I know).  At ruby-doc.org, the docs for Resolv::DNS don't appear to include any examples, and the method prototypes listed link to the code for the method. Why would I want to see that?! I'm using a library so I don't need to know how the code works.  I learned perl and a lot of other languages from complete, working programs, not samples a handful of lines long that performed contrived actions just for the sake of having an example.",1237696727
526992,comment,526866,526982,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I don't know, I think there's a valid point here.  A lot of people (usually Android supporters) assume the Cell. Phone market is going to go the way of the PC market in that generic manufacturers are going to take over.  That's what Dell tried to do and their rejection shows, at least for now, that isn't a valid philosophy.<p>Maybe that will change if, in the future, phones become interchangable and providers lose the power they have over the industry.  But for now the PC model doesn't work.",1237696331
526991,comment,526458,526808,0,0,rsheridan6,,,">What is the easiest way to bootstrap technology from scratch? It would probably be a lot easier in temperate climates where food is abundant; in many parts of the world too much effort would have to be spent on just staying alive.<p>If technology ceased to exist today, there would certainly be a massive die-off.  Farmers would not have the ability, and possibly not the motivation to feed all of the newly-useless urban dwellers.  Even if it would be possible for low-tech farming to feed everybody, it would be impossible to retool and retrain millions of people in time to plant this year.  California would get it the worst.  How would they even get across the desert and mountains to places where food is grown without irrigation?",1237696293

It is and always will be better to work with people you know, or have some connection to. That said, it's quite common for people to need work done and not be able to find an appropriate person to do it through normal networking. The yellow pages will take anyone.

That doesn't mean that reading _why's cartoons is in any way a good way (for me) to learn Ruby, which is a counterexample to your ""probably"".<p>Ruby is hardly difficult.<p>(For the sake of anecdotes: I find Python to be stultifyingly simplistic, with a number of negative features, and generally poor libraries.

But I’ve worked with my fair share of really great artists and the impression I’ve always been given is that great art comes from consistency of vision.  In other words it matters a great deal to them what shade of blue they use or how thick a line is.<p>This isn’t a mindset I, as a programmer, understand.  But I’ve seen great art come of it and the people making that great art have told me it’s important.<p>(I've also seen lousy art generated by committee which just backs up that claim)<p>I think that is the root of this conversation.  What Doug Bowman et. al are saying is there are different ways of doing things and Google doesn’t realize that.  They think everything can be done from an engineering standpoint and that’s a philosophy that kills the drive of most creative people.<p>So when you say ""why not let an algorithm figure it out"" you’re missing the creative person’s point.<p>(You said there ""is TONS of great human-driven design"" inside Google but I don’t know where you get that information from.  That’s not the way I’d always heard it)",1237695933

The point is that I'm pretty certain there are holes that will allow you to look at historic data and make statistically good buys - but you have to look where noone else is looking. Like the correlation of Nokia stock to the Finnish weather. Some of these will be large enough that you can make money, even though you alter the experiment.<p>On an unrelated note - I just read through your blog and found it very insightful :-)",1228784378

Most educated financial professionals don't believe tat you can predict future price movement with any degree of certainty, but there IS a fairly large following up that believes that price behavior is at least price reverting in the short term.<p>I got lucky, I basically flipped a coin and HAPPENED to do it on a day where the SP500 moved a LOT. moving averages do TERRIBLY in environments where the market doesn't trend hugely in one direction.

390629,comment,389977,390562,0,0,Zev,,,"The quote was given in 12/07. Back then, Verizon's network was largely made with BPON nodes (655mbit down, 155mbit up to each node). It really couldn't handle 100mbit at the time.  Since then, the FiOS network's been getting GPON upgrades (2.44gbit down, 1.22gbit up to each node), and is easily capable of handling 100mbit to the home. Times change and some companies really do upgrade equipment instead of overselling lines.<p>Rich and poor has nothing to do with it at all. Population does.  All I'm saying is to get the service to the largest number of people first - which happens to be urban areas. This way, there's more equipment being made and the techs have more practice doing said installations which will speed things up. Which then goes and brings the cost down and makes it cheaper to bring services out to more rural areas.<p>Monticello, MN was sued by TDS Telecom, not Verizon. You can't blame telco x for what telco y does when they're unrelated to each other beyond being telco's.<p>When did I say America was too big to wire up? Don't put words into my mouth. All I'm saying is that it costs more to run fiber one or two miles to a house then it does to run fiber ten or twenty miles. It's not hard to build a network, but it takes time and is expensive.<p>Comcast, Optimum Online, Time Warner, etc. They're cable companies that started in on telco. Verizon's the other way around - a telco that started in on cable. Which happened right around the time they started laying Fiber out for the first time.<p>Yes, we should be outraged at the shit that some of the companies do. But please don't lump every company into your bad egg basket just because a majority of them suck.<p>Now, if you want to be outraged at the fact that because the lines are fiber and not copper, Verizon doesn't have to share them anymore, go for it. If you want to be outraged at what Verizon is doing with Verizon Wireless caps, feel free to be. You'll be correct to be pissed off. But that's got nothing to do with FiOS.",1228781094

Any day trading successes I might manage would be eaten up by transaction costs at my current broker (where trades are $9.95, I think).  I'd probably be a far more active trader at $2.40 (which may not be a good thing, but cutting costs is always good).",1228780832

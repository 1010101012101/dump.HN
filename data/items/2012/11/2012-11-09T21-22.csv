4764902,comment,4764627,4764707,1,0,patrickambron,,,"This is such a good comment, and something I've wondered about too. I think there are three parts of the equation<p>1) StartUp people, especially founders, have a heightened appreciation of Time. Big organizations build in redundancy and shared responsibility. If something doesn't get done, it's not your fault and it's not the end of the world. The business goes on. In a startup, the buck stops with you, and if you don't get it done, it doesn't' happen. Time can not be wasted<p>2) Startup people generally love what they do. They aren't looking for a day off. Contrast that with most people. A day off is welcome.<p>3) The tech industry has an ""us vs the world' mentality that separates it form othe rindustries. Even my friends who wanted to work--because they had deadlines, etc--were left with no recourse. Our industry wants everyone to succeed. It's empathetic. Most people understand the pain and joy of building something, so they do everything they can to help others succeed as well. That doesn't exist (in my experience) in other industries, and it creates a community that other industries don't have. I think that's part of what we saw last week.",1352498236

Obviously some areas are nicer than others, but overall the range was pretty similar. Expect to pay $1000 (if you're really lucky, I saw some single bedrooms around that price in the valley) - $2000/each.

4764876,comment,4763848,4764584,8,0,rst,,,"That's true, but it's something of a self-inflicted wound.<p>The release of git and hg was a direct response to McVoy yanking BitKeeper away (withdrawing the free-beer licensing terms that had previously allowed gratis use for free/open source projects); both were initially announced on the Linux-kernel mailing list as responses to McVoy's move, and each had had only a few weeks' worth of work at that point.<p>Before that, there had been a good deal of grumbling about the ever-shifting terms of the ""don't piss off Larry license"", whose increasingly draconian terms were designed to prevent the development of competitive software.  (The last available version purported to bind all users to a non-compete preventing them from contributing to another SCM; I'm not sure California law would have allowed McVoy to enforce a non-compete on his own employees!)  However, so long as these difficulties remained theoretical, there was not, in fact, much serious work going on to develop such competition.  But when Larry revoked the license, effectively forcing the kernel developers to come up with an alternative damn quick, they did --- and damn quick.<p>So, the clones aren't something that the customers did when they got dissatisfied with BitMover; they're something that happened <i>after</i> BitMover chose, on their own, to end the relationship.  Which makes them, as I said, a self-inflicted wound, that BitMover could have avoided through better customer relations management.",1352497750

Even the Republican base hated him.<p>Right now the GOP leadership is busy flailing around trying to figure out why they didn't win. The ones who have gotten closest to the truth are the ones who have zeroed in on this year's lower-than-normal turnout of traditionally Republican voters (as this article touches upon). However, the underlying reason for that wasn't a failure of software or a lack of last-minute ""get out the vote"" campaigning, it's because people just plain didn't like Romney.<p>Remember the primaries? For months the Republican primaries were a game of ""anybody but Romney"". The primary voters at times even gave consideration to total crackpots like Santorum and Cain. Think about it -- they sent the message that they'd rather have some unelectable whackjob like Rick Santorum than be stuck with Romney. That's how much they didn't like him. But when it was all said and done, the Republicans finally gritted their teeth and accepted Romney as the nominee, despite the fact that they really, <i>really</i> didn't like the idea. Then on election day, many Republicans simply stayed home rather than hold their nose and vote for the guy.<p>Even if this ""Orca"" thing had worked perfectly it's doubtful it would have changed much.

This leads to support of adhoc queries -- ""Show me minutely clicks & revenue from 11am-1pm on Mondays in 2011 except holidays for publishers (A,B) against advertisers (A,B,C)"" As long as you define the grain of your data, adding new attributes for dimensions is very easy and flexible.<p>I guess I'm comparing it against better-suited-for-brute-force approaches where someone is analyzing a log file for really random things that tend to be a one-time thing. ""Show me hits to this particular resource from IP addresses which match this pattern and the user-agent contains Safari and the response time is larger than 300ms and the response size is less than 100ms!"". While you could fit this data easily into a DM, you'd need to plan ahead for that sort of querying. If it's a non-frequent occurrence, it'd make more sense to process it sequentially (even if its across 10,000 machines in a hadoop cluster).<p>When I left the company, our Greenplum cluster (so a bit of both worlds: RDBMS cluster that automatically parallelizes queries across multiple nodes and aggregates the results) was around 500T. This approach was scaled up from a single MySQL instance though, which were seeing around 5 million new rows per day for one particular business channel.<p>I'm not suggesting that ""new school"" approaches do not work nor not necessarily work quickly. What I am suggesting is this: MR is a very naive approach that is only ""fast"" due to executing the problem in parallel across many nodes. If you have datasets which are going to be queried often in similar use cases, one should take the past ~30 years of innovation in RDBMS' instead of masking the difficulties by throwing a lot of CPU (and therefore money) at a problem and solving it in the most inefficient manner possible. It pains me to see people coming up with overly complex ""solutions"" to basic OLAP needs on Hadoop-based or even NoSQL platforms instead of simply using the right tool for the job.<p>That said, the one-off cases where it doesn't make sense to build out a schema, ETL pipeline, and managing a database because it's a very niche or one-time need: That's where the real value of Hadoop/MR comes into play.",1352496110

E.g. you can have terabytes of data but as long as the actively accessed dataset is < ~80GB the system will perform well. Once things get out of RAM, everything will work well if you have an SSD. On a rotational disk, performance will degrade very very quickly. This is a bottleneck on all modern databases, but clustering makes this problem go away because you can effectively increase the amount of RAM at linear cost by just adding more nodes (e.g. two nodes at 100GB of RAM each cost about four times less than one node with 200GB of RAM).<p>2. We do do block-level replication. On each node of the btree we store replication timestamps. When a node asks for new data, we can cull away parts of the tree the node has almost instantly. So replication is very very efficient for most OLTP workloads. We don't have statement-level replication yet, so if you do a range update on a large table, we'll have to replicate data block by block. It'll take a while to add statement-based replication - we'd have to do a pretty significant refactoring to make it happen.<p>3. Either. Replicas are great for failover -- if the master dies, you just failover and a replica picks up where the master left off. If you're ok with out-of-date reads, you can also hit replicas directly (e.g. for reports, etc.) and spread out the read load across the cluster.<p>4. This is a really complex question - we didn't document this because doing it properly would take a lot of time. I'll ask jdoliner to chime in -- he designed the architecture and wrote most of the code, perhaps he can describe it succinctly while we write deeper docs on this :)<p>5. We use protocol buffers between the client drivers and the server. We picked that because there were libraries for the initial three languages we picked (Ruby, JS, Python), they were really easy to use, and very efficient. We could also have a single spec for the client/server API. Internally we use our own serialization scheme which allows us to dump arbitrary C++ objects on the network. It doesn't support other languages (which we didn't need), but is much more versatile for writing complex cross-machine code.",1352495475

Look at Zuckerburg with Facebook. He worked on Facebook-like ideas three times with various groups of uncommitted people until he finally got it right.",1193438993

I do not mean to sound rude, but for a blog with such title, you need to have some personal creds on a more informative ""About Author"" page.<p>So far the issues you've blogged about are not ""real"". Those issues (scaling, refusing an offer from VC and going with an angel instead) are good to have. <p>(1) Scaling IS NOT a problem startups without money face. <p>(2) Saying 'no' to VC funding and picking an angel IS NOT a problem startups without money face. The reason they have no VC money is because they have nobody to say 'no' to yet.<p>It's almost like you're preaching about diet to a person who's starving...<p>Startups without money need money <i>especially</i> if they want to grow. And where to get money - is the question that everybody asks and no blog had ever managed to provide answers for.<p>",1193438860

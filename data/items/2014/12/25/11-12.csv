8796072,comment,8795914,8795914,0,0,001sky,,,"Just general advice:<p>You want the cost to explore and adopt to be low.<p>You want the revenue of a retained customer to be high.<p>Unlimited pricing is a good sales tool when it helps minimize brain damage for your customer. They will over-value it if trying to figure out every possible use is scary, or difficult. In other words, it gives them room to experiment and uncapture hidden value (for them).<p>What you need to keep in mind is whether or not paying for this trial and error usage makes any sense. In other words, are they exploring your service? If so, they are likely finding value that once discovered they will be willing to pay a reasonable rate for. On the other hand, if they are exploiting you, they are just farming out their costs to you and this will never end (it always makes sense).<p>So, try to figure out why they want to stop. If they threaten to stop becuase of the brain-damage/experimentation issue,,,try to find a way to work around that. If they simply feel your service is simply un-economical priced any other way, you may want to expore that more carefully. In this case, you may have a bigger issue on your hands.<p>This gives you some frame work to think about features. Features which are necessary to explore vs features which allow simply &quot;power usage&quot;.  May want to treat those features and those stages of using your product distinct.",1419508608

I consequently do not feel deterred by &quot;leave science for the scientists&quot;.<p>If you dabble in robotics as a hobby then you know that it&#x27;s possible to gain a lot of understanding as a layperson, even in a challenging multi-disciplinary field like robotics is. Certain fields can be accessible, and in my opinion psychology is one of the most accessible. A casual reader may not have a nuanced understanding, or an idea of how to apply the result to other areas, but they will have some understanding, a mental hook for further knowledge.<p>Laypeople can dabble effectively in scientific analysis.

Hell, we&#x27;re on the verge of an effective vaccine for malaria. That alone would be a miracle that saves about a million lives each year.<p>And, I&#x27;d hoped space exploration would have gotten further. We seem to have lost vision on that front.

Maybe better in terms of reducing the harm humans do the earth.<p>Which brings me to the disastrous behavior of humanity toward the environment.

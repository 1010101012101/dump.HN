1688276,comment,1687974,1687974,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"I preferred Nitro over Rails when they both arrived in 2004.  Nitro made it far easier to evolve an application from a single static HTML file to any degree of complexity (plus it was faster,  thread safe, and more modular).  Rails seemed better suited to a very specific genre of application.  Great when you're building that app; less so when you needed to color outside the lines.<p>Ramaze picked up where Nitro left.  All software is opinionated; I prefer the opinions built into Ramaze.   Whatever tool you pick, whatever language you use, make sure the opinions it embodies align with yours, or you'll find yourself frustrated way too often.<p>But I really think the alleged hating on Rails has more to do with how some people perceive its more vocal proponents.  Sadly, it all feels like being back in high school again. It's the ""rock star"" and ""hero"" nonsense that grates.<p>People would do better to scope out the various languages and tools, learn to appreciate the good stuff,  steal the better ideas for their own preferences, and ignore the personalities and drama.<p>Code talks, bullshit walks.",1284411573

I personally love Rails but it is a bit heavy and shouldn't be used for smaller projects. But that's not Rails fault it was more a misunderstanding of Rails' sweet spot. For those smaller projects I now use Sinatra.<p>That said when I first started using Rails, four years ago, it should have come with a warning sticker about deployment issues. A smaller VPS that could handle dozens of PHP apps could be only really handle one maybe two Rails apps. Litespeed, Passenger, JRuby, etc. have made these issues go away, but I can see how it might have left a bad impression of the framework.<p>P.S.

1688253,comment,1687974,1687974,0,0,BrandonM,,,"<rant><p>If I'm a good C programmer, if I grok Lisp, if I'm fluent in Python, if I can accomplish damn near any file munging task from a bash prompt, and if I have an understanding of component-based development, then I should be suitable for the vast majority of programming jobs. Yet something like 90% of job postings require X years of experience in Ruby, PHP, Java, or some Microsoft-specific language. Many of the interesting programming jobs have chosen to select for a language that I could learn in a couple hours, work with in a couple days, and use well in a couple weeks, but because I don't know it <i>right now</i>, I'm not hire-able.<p><i>Background, intelligence, and work ethic be damned, you need Ruby and Rails experience to work here, because after all we have many applicants and someone is bound to fit all our criteria. And while we're on our soapbox, why-oh-why are good programmers so hard to find?</i> Because you're not even trying. You have too much other crap to do, and you're just looking for a quick, safe reason to reject everyone else and have a couple people conveniently left over to choose from. And no, I don't know the ins and outs of b-trees anymore, but give me some time with Google and vim  and I'll have a C solution ready to be tested. You know, the way real work is done.<p>So yeah, I suppose I do find myself bitter that I'm expected to pick up a trendy language and platform (and recall every data structure I learned 4 years ago) to even have a chance on the job market. From the outside it just looks like a giant Ruby/Rails clique (or PHP/Cake, or Java/Spring, or whatever technology your company has happened to fall into). We're all forced to learn something that we don't <i>actually</i> need -- we can already get it done with similar effort in another way -- just for you to consider hiring us. And everyone has a slightly different stack that I have to go teach myself just to avoid looking like an idiot in the application process.<p>And it's not just Rails and the languages I don't know (yet!). Even the Python job postings I find almost without fail require experience with Django or some other framework <i>du jour</i>. I mean geez, how long does it take to learn a freaking framework, especially with a bit of early guidance? Stop selecting for the wrong criteria!<p>I'm not one of the ones typically ""bashing"" Rails, but I understand the frustration of being forced to learn a bunch of crap as part of an elaborate mating game of inefficient, badly-designed hiring practices. Just throw some work my way, give me the email of a knowledgeable employee who can answer occasional questions, start me out at a below-market rate, and evaluate my role and contributions in a month or two when I've had a chance to get acclimated. The filters that employers use are such bullshit, and then to make it worse they slap us in the face by claiming that it's impossible to find good programmers.<p></rant><p>What was the question again?",1284411368

His organization <i>requires</i> all software used to have such a certificate.<p>The truly nefarious aspect of this weird policy (which seems to exist, in lesser forms in other places, based on demands we've had for various specific bits of information on invoices) is that Open Source software is completely out of the running in the organizations that embrace such a policy. In our case, Virtualmin is an umbrella under which a couple dozen Open Source apps run, so I guess having the certificate for Virtualmin satisfies the policy (at least well enough for the IT guy to bluff his way through).<p>This isn't really comparable to political dissent being squashed, of course, but it gave me a pretty chilling view of Microsoft and their anti-piracy practices that I hadn't been aware of, and makes me far more likely to believe that MS would participate in using the thug power of Russian police in order to scare organizations and individuals out of pirating their products.<p>I'll also note that the BSA ""report your neighbor"" whistle-blower policy, which has been in effect for a couple of decades, has always reeked a little of the secret police and surveillance culture found in oppressive regimes.",1284410827

Trying to fix myopia by getting children exposed to more sunlight is a bit of a &quot;let them eat single-source organic asparagus&quot; response: it makes would-be social reformers feel good, but it&#x27;s not a realistic way to reliably give all children the (apparently) minimum three daily hours of 10,000 lux.

In areas with often-overcast conditions and/or short winter[ days](EDIT) it wouldn&#x27;t even be sufficient. Classrooms that admit more natural light would be great, but they&#x27;re not a realistic means of getting to 3h × 10,000 lux across the board, if only because replacing almost the entire stock of primary-school classrooms would be a slow and expensive process. The most obvious solution is to rig up classrooms with multiple SAD lights, light-meter them to ensure that every desk gets at least 10,000 lux when the system is on, then run the system for maybe four hours every classroom day.<p>(Speaking of which, if I was in charge of a minor child I&#x27;d go ahead and stick a SAD lamp in its bedroom and leave it on for most of the day.)",1429594877

Allowing users to downmod each other, as a means of curbing abuse, is an invaluable tool: self-policing of users has obvious merits which should be rightly acknowledged. However, downmodding as a means of pure disagreement should be unconditionally banned on Hacker News. The fact that downmodding is an acceptable means of expressing disagreement is a disservice to public commentary. If a comment is relevant and non-abusive, there is no reason it should ever be downmodded.<p>In other words: If you are downmodding out of disagreement, you should not have downmod privileges. If you don&#x27;t agree with a message, use your words. Don&#x27;t try to prevent others from reading it.<p>Downmodding only serves to promote resentment among users with unique viewpoints. The ability to express relevant but controversial opinions is fatally hindered when those opinions are suppressed due to unpopularity. Downmodding is a form of communal censorship, and it should be treated as such. For a community which bills itself as for hackers, and by hackers, &quot;popular opinion&quot; should be the least of all factors -- it should be scoffed at by any self-respecting hacker.

For example, laws banning minority activites such as homosexual sex or interracial marriage; laws imprisoning Japanese in WWII or banning forms of political speech in many eras; laws banning peaceful protest during political conventions; laws that penalize poor people&#x27;s vices (crack, dope) much more harshly than rich people&#x27;s vices (cocaine, prescription drugs).<p>* Police enforcement is sometimes discriminatory: Much research supports that some minorities are harassed by law enforcement (e.g., &#x27;driving while black&#x27;, or stop-and-frisk in major cities). What might be overlooked from a middle-class white can result in jail time for a poor black.<p>* Prosecutor enforcement is sometimes discriminatory: Research supports that some minorties are charged with harsher crimes than other citizens, for the same behavior. The powerful and connected get a pass.<p>* Judicial enforcement is sometimes discriminatory: Research supports that convictions and sentencing are harsher for minorities. Also consider the long history of blacks facing all-white juries. Also, the poor have much less access to judicial resources, such as a good lawyer.<p>There is a long history of blacks, for example, being defenseless against all-white police forces, governments and judicial systems.

7329977,comment,7329467,7329467,6,0,robomartin,,,"Some of the most significant issues with the iPad have to do with two areas: user management and the Apple &quot;wall&quot;<p>The first cuts across a wide range of applications from consumer to business.  The lack of multiuser capabilities (with permissions and all the things modern multiuser OS&#x27;s can do) seriously limits usability.<p>At home I would like to make a distinction between my usage of an iPad, that of my children and that of guests.  No, i don&#x27;t want to buy a separate device for each use case.  Accounts for children could have limits set to restrict usage to a pre selected set of apps, time limits, app store settings, etc.  Guest accounts would have the ability to setup similar restrictions.  A house guest should not be able to open and browse your email, facebook, paypal or whatever.<p>The same issue applies to business usage.  An iPad is a security nightmare in lots of business scenarios.  Adding a layer of user management would be a huge step towards fixing this problem.  For example, if I use an iPad as a cash register I don&#x27;t want the cash register user to be able to use any other app.  Perhaps i also want them to be able to browse the company website in order to assist customers and that&#x27;s it.<p>The Apple &quot;wall&quot; is how I&#x27;ve been descriibing the Apple&#x27;s control-freak hold on the device and the OS.  This goes from the lack of USB and memory card connectivity to the lack of access to a file system, impossibly cumbersome file sharing between apps, totalitarian control of the one-and-only connector (leading to ridiculous hacks such as using the audio port for data communications, something that dates back to the early &#x27;80&#x27;s!).<p>It&#x27;s intersting to walk into an Apple store and see the iPads they have locked down to a single app that tells you about the device next to it.  Apple themselves understand there are business cases where you need a device that is very tightly controlled, even to the point of limiting it to a single app.  They get it.  They simply have no interest in letting us through the wall.<p>Windows <n> and Surface are not and have never been perfect solutions.  However, they benefit significantly from your ability to do just about anything you want with them, to connect to and talk to almost any external hardware device in the market and to easily design your own for special applications.  You can setup users for your particular needs.  You can even install other OS&#x27;s --replacing Windows-- or simply run them in a virtual machine.<p>I&#x27;ve come to view our iPads more as toys than as universal machines.  They get used for web browsing, playing games and reading eBooks and that&#x27;s just about it.<p>I continue to be stunned by how bad Microsoft marketing is.  Instead of driving home the point that the iPad is a severely restricted and crippled device they actually spent good money making commercials with people dancing around clicking keyboards on and off their devices.  If that&#x27;s what they trully think is the most significant distinguishing value of their devices they are truly clueless.",1393783056

One did once generate so much customer support e-mail and customization requests that I made a commercial version that sold well, but I was never passionate about it so I ended up selling the rights and probably wouldn&#x27;t bother doing that again.<p>* Projects that I know full well will run at a loss, but I build them anyway for various reasons, from &quot;it&#x27;s fun&quot; to &quot;maybe it&#x27;ll be good marketing for the paid stuff&quot;.

Wrote lots of utilities in C and UNIX shell tools (sed, awk, grep and friends) to automate various tasks (for both users and developers), convert data between various formats from one\nplatform to another, etc.<p>Relevant links:<p>My Bitbucket account with my open source projects:<p><a href=""https://bitbucket.org/vasudevram"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/vasudevram</a><p>Biz site: <a href=""http://www.dancingbison.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dancingbison.com</a> (see Home, Products, Services, About pages there)<p><a href=""http://www.binpress.com/profile/vasudev-ram/3425"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.binpress.com/profile/vasudev-ram/3425</a><p>Posts about Python:<p><a href=""http://jugad2.blogspot.com/search/label/python"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jugad2.blogspot.com/search/label/python</a><p>Posts about xtopdf:<p><a href=""http://jugad2.blogspot.com/search/label/xtopdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jugad2.blogspot.com/search/label/xtopdf</a><p>Blog: <a href=""http://jugad2.blogspot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jugad2.blogspot.com</a><p>Article by me about &quot;Developing a Linux command-line utility&quot; (in C) was published on IBM developerWorks and translated by IBM into Chinese and Japanese for those versions of their site.

Theft is a <i>much simpler</i> hypothesis than many that are being proposed, but this doesn&#x27;t really fit the pattern of the previous major thefts by wallets trusted by the community. The main difference is we that we know who these people are. It doesn&#x27;t seem likely they could ever really cash-out without being observed. Even if they don&#x27;t try to do that there are likely to be indictments and prosecutions that they will have to live through.",1393779812

I do believe, that like drug addiction, one can have support and knowledge and experience, but the battle is won or lost in the mind of the actor.<p>The real issue here is my own struggle between the ideals of personal freedom and my heart breaking over the brothers and sisters i lose every day. I reserve the right to check out whenever i want, but it must be on my terms and in my control. I personally believe that being an untreated manic/depressive is tantamount to lack of control. Ditto for young people who are trapped by a fabricated environment. If a cancer victim wants to top, who am i to say no? I realize these are extreme thoughts, and i am sorry if my phrasing is crass.",1393779750

Then JavaScript would not be able to support JSON without an external bignum library, which many/most applications do not actually need, and JSON would be less convenient to use.<p>Or would you prefer they had specifically defined IEEE double precision as the numeric representation?  Then JSON numbers would be useless for qemu&#x27;s offsets and other applications that need numbers not representable as IEEE double precision.<p>Leaving it unspecified means that implementations support what they can.  If you end up needing actual int64s in JavaScript, you can drop in a BigNum library and get them.  It&#x27;s true that not all numbers can be represented by all implementations, but that was true already.",1393779702

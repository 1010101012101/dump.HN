Some use it to kill trolls, others to agree/disagree. I generally agree with you regarding how I downmod.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=147098"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=147098</a>",1213149983
214521,comment,214398,214433,0,0,gojomo,,,"PG once before weighed in with ""it's ok to use the up and down arrows to express agreement"" [1].<p>But, the mixing of the ""quality"" axis with an ""agree/disagree"" axis risks coarsening discussion. A disagree-downvote is mildly censorious: it lowers a comment's placement and docks the commenter's karma. It stings.<p>I don't <i>want</i> to downvote comments simply because I disagree, but if such comments are highly-placed because of some superficial popular appeal, and comments I more agree with are lowly-placed, I want to restore some balance of attention. I then tend to cast a few votes based on agreement/disagreement.<p>One possible answer is an idea I've plugged whenever this issue comes up: start a second orthogonal rating axis that is explicitly for agree/disagree [2][3]. It could be little left/right arrows, at the end of the comment. Then you might 'disvote' a comment you disagree with, but still 'upvote' it because it was well-stated... etc.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=117171"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=117171</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=117196"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=117196</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=126917"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=126917</a>",1213149854

This is especially true for someone who goes through said school and strives to become a prosecutor with political ambitions. For if they attain high level success as a prosecutor and in the political arena yet they cannot understand the fundamental difference between malicious intent and a prank rooted in activism then they are a scary person to be in a position of power. They will be making and implementing policy decisions with arbitrary and personal bias not hard facts.<p>Someone in a position of power is not strong unless they know when to apply the full amount of power entrusted to them and when to practice restraint; when and how to apply less so that the level of punishment is commiserate with the crime being prosecuted. It is bad for our society to give give someone a pass when they over prosecute a crime in both the short term and the long term.",1358103524
5051468,comment,5051250,5051440,5,0,_delirium,,,"I can see that argument, but I guess I just don't think I'd personally make that decision in the case of lengthy imprisonment. It's probably a laudable one, but my interest in not spending decades in a claustrophobic situation without freedom, subject to what seem like fairly frightening possibilities (high prevalence of prison rape, etc.) would likely outweigh my desire to live an inspiring life as a prison activist. I think the fact that you can't change your mind later is what frightens me about it in particular. If, a few years in, it's so horrible that I really would rather be dead, it's too late to do anything about it at that point; once you go in, there really is no escape.<p>In just about any other case I would agree with your assessment of the choice, though.

Using it merely means you share title in your derived work.<p>This (having GPLed code laying around) is a 'found book' scenario. You've got a copy that you didn't violate copyright to make, thus it's legal to use.<p>EULAs are a non-copyright attempt to control this usage. They used to be based on the idea that any and all copying, incidental or otherwise, was prohibited and thus to use software (and copy it into memory) you needed a license. But this has been specifically denied in current US copyright law.<p>Blanket permission is now given for copying where it's an inherent part of using the work. This supports the idea that usage is generally unrestricted (unless you or your agent acquired this specific copy by license). Which makes sense; they'd have called it UsageRight instead of CopyRight if they meant that.<p>Now EULAs are (usually) based on the Uniform Commercial Code but that requires a contract (of sale) which can, of course, only be binding on the original parties and their agents.<p>So again, why would a EULA be enforceable on software a user found?<p>As for forum humor, do you know what I find funny?

It is related to the idea that no one knows what is legal anymore, and in this case too federal prosecutors drove a man (Peter Gleason) to suicide.<p>Very briefly, once you spend four billion[1] to get a drug approved by FDA for purpose A, a doctor can choose to prescribe it for purposes B, C, and D -- and can publish papers on said applications -- but you as the manufacturer are prohibited from discussing these ""off label"" applications with other doctors through your salesforce. Even handing out papers is a gray area. So a pharma rep in an office with a doctor concerned about condition B and a patient who suffers from condition B is prohibited, under this FDA theory, from remarking on the utility of his company's drug for condition B. Since ~40% of prescriptions [2] are for off-label uses of drugs, this is a very big deal.<p>The reason for this ban on ""off-label marketing"" is that the FDA wants you to spend another few billion to take the new application through the entire New Drug Application process; relying on distributed doctors rather than centralized FDA for drug evaluation means FDA loses user fees and review authority. Note that the drug has already been proved <i>safe</i> as dosages in off-label applications are very similar; FDA however does not want doctors to judge on their own whether the drug is  <i>efficiacious</i> (these are terms of art in the drug industry). Since FDA cannot regulate doctors directly due to the AMA's clout, they go after drug companies who are under their purview and block them from mentioning anything other than purpose A.<p>With that background, now to the GSK fine:\n<a href=""http://www.justice.gov/usao/ma/news/2012/July/GSKsettlement.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justice.gov/usao/ma/news/2012/July/GSKsettlement....</a><p><pre><code>  Global health care giant GlaxoSmithKline LLC (GSK) agreed \n  to plead guilty and to pay $3 billion to resolve its \n  criminal and civil liability arising from the companys \n  unlawful promotion of certain prescription drugs\n\n  Under the provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, \n  a company in its application to the FDA must specify each \n  intended use of a drug.

They said, No, this isnt. \n\n  Dr. Gleason, 53, was taken aback because he was arrested, \n  and later charged, for doing something that has become \n  common among doctors: promoting a drug for purposes other \n  than those approved by the federal government.\n</code></pre>\nThat was from 2006.

5051300,comment,5050971,5050971,4,0,fh973,,,"Again somebody seems to misunderstand what OS means. Only because Android OS and Chrome OS are called operating systems does not mean they play in the same category as Windows. Windows is a platform, because it has vendor-provided high-quality drivers for basically any hardware device, wheres Android, Chrome, and OS X are always a customization for a particular device or device series. Drivers and a good driver model for the OS are hard.<p>If there was no Windows (or better anything like the x86-Windows PC platform), there would likely be no hardware platform to run Linux on, and CPUs for OS X would be way less powerful due to lack of the progress of a highly competitive market over two decades.<p>For this reason, the potential demise of Windows is a nightmare that should keep any IT professional awake. But I am optimistic: web apps have yet to prove to be on par with desktop apps, and there seems always to be the next desktop app when you think people are basically only using a web browser. I am confident that in 10 years there still will be Windows PCs or Laptops in private households, together with many other devices.<p>Or am I missing something?",1358100244

It was completely hidden in a cloud of smog. There was some of the worst air quality of the year at that time from all the fireworks plus being the coldest time of year (so everyone is burning coal fires), and a ton of debris in the air from a 44 floor skyscraper that burned to the ground down the street (video: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hSPFL2Zlpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hSPFL2Zlpg</a>)<p>I never really knew what coal burning smelled like before. Even in the city it isn't allowed, but once we left and went to a smaller town outside Beijing that's when I really got it.  It is the heat source for 99% of the population, plus it powers most of the factories. There were days where we were told we shouldn't be outside unless absolutely necessary (which was, since my husband had to commute to his job at Microsoft).  At night if you blew your nose your tissue would be grey.  If you took a shower, the water would run grey from dust wherever your skin had been exposed.  Your clothes would be dusted in a thin layer of gray that never really went away.  We tried to combat this by changing out of our clothes just inside the front door and putting them straight into the wash, but it never really went away.",1358100190
5051298,comment,5050811,5051165,9,0,anonymouz,,,"They do! Or at least they are starting to. At least in physics/math in my experience most people have a personal homepage that they post their papers to, and also upload them on ArXiv. There is some complication with regards to copyright, because to publish in a journal you usually need to assign the exclusive rights to them. Nowadays most journals have realized the need for authors to post their papers on personal homepages and e-print services like the ArXiv, so that this is no big deal in practice.<p>There are still problems:\n1.) Usually old papers are not available via this route. If you email the author and ask nicely he will usually send it to, but at least in pure mathematics one quite common wants to look up really old articles, say from the 1950s, and those are the ones that are terribly hard to come by, because they are often only available behind a paywall like JSTOR.<p>2.) Currently ""prestige"" and peer review is handled through the journal system: Authors send their papers to a journal for publication, other scientists review them (for free), and then the paper gets published (or not). Afterwards publishing houses, who add little value to the process, force libraries to pay horrendous amounts of money to get access to these journals (usually through selling bundles).<p>At the moment there are efforts underway to pleasure publishers into a saner pricing structure, and there are now some open access journals where usually the author pays once (if at all) and then it is free to read for everyone.<p>Many people also consider more radical approaches, for example, making journals simply be ArXiv overlays that point to a set of papers on the ArXiv. I have even heard suggestion of replacing peer review, at least partially, by an open review system like you suggest, and some journals have experimented with it, but it does not seem to have a lot of consensus behind it at the moment. But this is in a way orthogonal to the problem of making research available to as many people as possible.<p>The problem with the very radical change that you suggest, i.e., using blogs instead of research papers, is that peer reviewed papers have proven their worth over a long period of time. It is doubtful whether simple blog posts would guarantee a similar quality over a long period of time. My personal feeling is that there would be a lot of noise and incorrect stuff drowning out the important stuff.<p>With regards to your edit: If you submit a paper that seems to be serious research to a journal, it will be reviewed, and if it holds up, eventually published. If the paper is decent, you'll be able get it published without being associated to an academic institution (at least in mathematics, can't speak for other fields).",1358100189

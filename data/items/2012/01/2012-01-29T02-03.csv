The first is ""Claude Allegre, former director of the Institute for the Study of the Earth, University of Paris"".<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_All%C3%A8gre"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_All%C3%A8gre</a><p>> In 1996, Allgre opposed the removal of carcinogenic asbestos from the Jussieu university campus in Paris, describing it as harmless and dismissing concerns about it as a form of ""psychosis created by leftists"". The campus' asbestos is deemed to have killed 22 people and caused serious health problems in 130 others.<p>I think I'd pass on his endorsement, personally...",1327805994
3524273,comment,3522946,3523329,1,0,bugmenot,,,"What he said. I had a (relatively) similar experience, and if I could go back I'd be: 1. More apt to part ways with founders who couldn't execute on their part of the business, 2. More willing to raise money sooner (it's awfully easy to get focused on maintaining a % of ownership despite how laughably worthless it still is at that point -- we self-funded and that meant we didn't have enough to do what we needed to, but we still spent everything we had), and 3. More willing to adjust the business plan to fit the market, whether that means changing your product, business model, minimum feature set, strategy to appeal to investors, amount of capital needed, ownership terms, etc.<p>I'm still convinced the model was completely sound, but we could have done much better (and by that I mean actually turned a profit) by biting off less on the product, and giving up more to secure funding.<p>That said, it was still worth it every penny. Learned far more practical knowledge than one picks up in any MBA program, and the lessons were internalized in a way, and to a degree, that I (personally) couldn't have gotten any other way. Sure, I wish it would have worked out, but I think it did far more for me than spending those years working in some generic job to pad someone else's bottom line would have.",1327805983

3524264,comment,3524041,3524041,9,0,nhashem,,,"It's pretty hard to start a startup while you have full-time employment you're relatively happy with, both because of physical time constraints and reconciling the risk mentally.<p>In the past I felt exactly like these guys did: apply for incubators, which will provide both validation and financing, which makes a transition a lot less painful.  It's one thing to tell your wife, ""yeah so I quit my $125,000 job to work with Joe on our startup, which is really just a bunch of unreleased code at this point"" as opposed to, ""yeah so I quit my $150,000 to work with Joe on our startup, but we're in YC, which is like Harvard for startups, and we're getting over $150,000 in funding, and like half these companies raise venture capital really quickly after the program.""  Hell, it's a lot easier to <i>tell yourself</i> that.<p>A few months ago I wrote a post about my experience interviewing at YC and getting rejected, and I mentioned how we didn't continue working on our idea, and a lot of people asked me why.  And the most honest answer I could give was, ""I felt it was too big of a risk to take off my golden handcuffs without Paul Graham's approval,"" which sounds kind of absurd but is the most plain explanation I can give.<p>Well it's been over a year since then and I've realized two main problems with that way of thinking.  1) All an incubator can really do is <i>amplify</i> your ability to conceive of ideas and execute well on them.  But if you can do both of those things well anyway, then you'll be successful regardless of acceptance or not.  2) If you refuse to embark on starting a startup without getting accepted into an incubator, then you're limiting yourself to ""incubator-friendly"" ideas, which is generally something that is consumer-facing and disruptive in some theoretically huge market (or eventual market) (e.g. AirBnb, Dropbox) or is a tool/platform that can improve the startup ecosystem of tools and platforms (which it seems like Keen.io is, if I understand their value prop on their home page correctly).<p>So congrats to the Keen.io for getting into TechStars, and I'm sure their product will be great, and they'll go on to be successful without having to sacrifice much more than going out to dinner a little less and downgrading their Netflix subscription.  But it's very possible they were going to be successful anyway.",1327805769

What does the US need SOPA for if every one else implements it?<p>What is pretty sad is that the world community supported the anti US SOPA movement, but no big players in the US want to support all those other countries who supported them. Where are google and wikipedia on the upcoming EU laws, for example? Will they black out European or Canadian users for 24hrs?<p>Well, if each threatened country does not get world community support and implements its version of SOPA, then its was all for nothing.<p>Cant help but think that 2012 will be an Armageddon of sorts after all.

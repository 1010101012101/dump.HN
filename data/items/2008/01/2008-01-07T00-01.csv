Was this correlated with time of day? Or a particular day? More interesting would be something like, on average, how long did it take for users to respond to the survey after it was activated. I venture to guess that this information -- unless most users give detailed comments, as opposed to clicking Yes/No, which most lazy users would do -- is hard to make useful unless you collect further usage details which would put the app into the spyware category.",1199665820
95478,comment,95405,95405,0,0,queensnake,,,"I can only speak to #1, but dang, it's so true. I don't know what the F some companies are doing, requiring C++, Java, JavaScript and 6 other technologies (and mentioning eg ClearCase by name, WTF!). Is it that HR is deluged with irrelevant resumes, and they think that by tightening the requirements they'll get fewer? Or is it that, getting to 'wish into the void', they get a boost in vicarious self-esteem by asking for their idea of 'only the best'? (I think I've seen this once, is why this possibility occurred to me). But yeah, being conscientious I don't submit myself when I see something /required/ that I don't have. Then some recruiter will come along and say ""Well, they're not so serious about that"". I agree that the HR layer doesn't suit IT.<p>One other peeve, companies that talk like they're so special: ""You'll love us, we're not like the rest, everyone sits on big red chairs here!"". I don't know why that bugs me, but I'd say save it for the interview / tour. At least restrain it a bit in the job ad.",1199665386

It doesn't need to be an essay, just, a couple examples.<p>I can only say, at this late stage I wish I'd gone into some physical engineering instead, chemical or electrical, something with hard /science/. I doubt I'll get to make such a transition, or well, would find it hard to finance and might find it not worthwhile at this late stage. I suppose robotics might be an avenue to explore, that'll get big before too long.<p>But back to the topic, I'll take any experience you have on what to expect.",1199664380

In the end, I got fired because the boss wanted to ""change things up"" since he wasn't getting things done as quickly as he wanted (mostly his fault for changing requirements). It took me less than 2 weeks to find a new job. There is no reason that you can't start looking for a new job while still working for your current company.",1360162796

You live every second of your life, how you live it is up to you, and to a smaller (but not always small) extent up to the circumstances around you.  Every decision you make (or don't) pushes you in a direction, sort of a life vector.  You can change the direction and the size of the vector, but it's yours, no matter what, and it's not a waste.  Even if you live your entire life and leave not a ripple behind you, your life still has worth.

Didn't do well enough at the job interview or you're a total bozo and poor at understanding technical concepts/writing code? No problem! They'll appoint you as a project manager and you will get a team of developers to manage. At the same time, the brightest and the best engineers rarely get promoted because they are keeping their heads down and actually getting shit done. And there is little incentive for the company to promote such people because they lose a skilled and productive programmer if they do that (they don't care about anything except for how fast you can crank out code - one of the typical ailments of consulting companies).<p>It's a very sad state of affairs.

If I fork it, I then have to monitor whether the upstream author shows up again and then I have to figure out what to do about his/her changes.<p>If anything GitHub makes it easier for someone to half-ass a project and then abandon it as it is starting to get popular.

I mean, sure, you might want to open with one or two of these questions, just to test someone for bullshit. But if someone's applying to be a data scientist and can't tell you what a 95% CI means, or what Type 1 and Type 2 errors are, or describe the concept of expected value, their resumes probably shouldn't have passed your filter in the first place.<p>Second, I take issue with the ""marketers are mathematical Neanderthals"" line. This is a broad stereotype that does nobody any favors. As much as everyone likes to take swings at MBA types every so often, graduate-level marketers need to be highly proficient in statistics to be competent at their work. Few of them can code, I'm sure, so in as much as that's the case, they're probably not of tremendous value to an early-stage growth team. But a classical marketing training most certainly includes strategy, stats, data analytics, etc. It's not just advertising.<p>Now, if you're talking about ""marketers"" in the sense of Communications majors who've never so much as passed Calc B, I'd see your point.

    only at 10 or 65. We recruited students of the 
    University of Oregon as participants in our experiment. 
    One of us would stand in front of a small group, spin 
    the wheel, and ask them to write down the number on 
    which the wheel stopped, which of course was either 10 
    or 65.

    We then asked them 2 questions:

     1. Is the percentage of African nations among UN members larger or smaller than the number you just wrote?

     2. What is your best guess of the percentage of African nations in the UN?


     The spin of a wheel of fortune  even one that is not 
     rigged  cannot possibly yield useful information about 
     anything, and the participants in our experiment should 
     simply have ignored it. But they did not ignore it. The 
     average estimates of those who saw 10 and 65 were 
     25% and 45%, respectively.

The code would first attempt to just do what it wants, but within a memory transaction. If the memory transaction cannot commit, there is a conflict from another core or thread, then it goes to the regular slow path with the locks. If applied at the right granularity almost all of your atomic operations should succeed with the TSX path and you will rarely invoke the heavier lock based code.<p>There is talk of performance measurement, but no numbers in the article, probably because Haswell isn't released.<p><p> <a href=""http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2012/11/06/exploring-intel-transactional-synchronization-extensions-with-intel-software"" rel=""nofollow"">http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2012/11/06/exploring-i...</a>",1360159510

Also it has the easiest/best implementation of incognito mode.

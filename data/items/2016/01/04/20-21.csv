10838549,comment,10836949,10837318,0,0,exelius,,,"> These regulations should be fairly basic: pass all IPv6 traffic unmodified, pass all IPv4 traffic unmodified except for NAT.<p>Erm, pretty much NOBODY does this - even today. Every packet you send out from your ISP has (and has had for at least 4 years - probably longer) headers, cookies, etc. injected long before it reaches the public Internet. Then along the way more companies inject things into it. Then the load balancers at the other end likely do as well.<p>This is not all for evil purposes, either: lots of DDOS and botnet traffic gets blackholed thanks to these optimizations. Trouble is, the ability / need for legitimate network management requires tools that can also be used for less awesome purposes, and those less awesome purposes are usually how you can justify the money for the tools in the first place.<p>A lot of people on HN seem to have a purist view about how Internet traffic should be handled once it leaves your house. The companies that actually manage said traffic haven&#x27;t shared this view or even operated a network that looks <i>remotely</i> like it for a decade or more. Your data is everywhere; and if it&#x27;s not being sold by your ISP (which it is) it&#x27;s being sold by your bank, by Amazon, by Google -- pretty much anyone you do business with on or off line.",1451941160

When what you do or don&#x27;t do is all up to you, the portion of BS work goes to 0 because you don&#x27;t want to do it so you don&#x27;t. Companies fall on a BS scale that correlates to their size and determines how much BS work you don&#x27;t want to do that you have to do anyway (or rather, you always have a choice, but if you don&#x27;t do it then you&#x27;re fired/the company goes out of business/a customer is pissed off and sues you/etc. which makes it not much of a choice at all).",1451941133

It has a navigation system (a very expensive upgrade forced on me by the dealer as part of their package bundling strategy) that really sucks.<p>I vowed this: I will never buy another car that does not support CarPlay.  If I have to, I&#x27;ll go to older cars and buy used and retrofit a third party carplay system in it-- hell going to CarToys and having them do that would be a lot LOT cheaper than what I paid for the useless navigation system.<p>Car dealers (And everyone else hardware oriented it seems) can&#x27;t make decent software... barely anyone but Apple can.. so why they think they can force proprietary systems on us an d make us think its &quot;choice&quot; is beyond me.<p>Furthermore the only reason CarPlay exists is because Apple is dong the car companies jobs for them (since they suck at software, and Apple does not.)

There&#x27;s a heuristic in programming that if a function is more than a page in length, it&#x27;s probably too complicated.

(Self-)regulations and certifications did not result in privileges, since they were already there. In fact they attached quite a few strings where before there were none.<p>> (...) that they will only admit appropriately qualified individuals into their ranks, and that they will always act honestly (...)<p>Regulations/certifications are here to provide a minimum evidence of competence in a given field. Are they a weak evidence? Absolutely. But it also always beats the alternative, which is &quot;just trust me&quot;. The point is that in advanced societies anything critical, profession or otherwise, cannot be built on trust, it has to be built on some kind of proof and accountability, however imperfect. And the author here is not demanding or proposing different, better proofs to the current system, he is just saying that enforcing such proof via regulation is a privilege built on prestige.<p>> Notice how in this supposed bargain, what we give the professionals is concrete and clearly valuable, while what they give us (...) is vague and very hard for us to check.<p>This is the laziest part of the argument, and to be honest it feels as if it&#x27;s from someone who has never set foot abroad. Of course we can check it. We just have to compare with countries where these regulations (&quot;privileges&quot;) are not enforced. You want to know how it looks like when pilots, architects, or surgeons can practice without a licence (or fake it)? Just go to Congo or Sierra Leone, and observe the number of accidents, failures, or outright fraud. Notice also how all societies, when they modernize, move to the same type of regulations, regardless of their cultural/religious/political specificities.<p>> and yet we have mostly not chosen those substitutes due to our eagerness to affiliate with prestigious professionals<p>And of course there are countries that are (comparatively) considered &quot;low prestige&quot;, like Poland or Thailand, that attract a large number of medical tourists because despite being lower profile the professionals there abide by the same vetting mechanisms, and their doctors are on par with ours... So the &quot;it&#x27;s just prestige&quot; thing doesn&#x27;t hold up.<p>> Cheaper yet outcome-effective substitutes to expensive professionals have long been physically available<p>The point of &quot;exclusive&quot; regulations is not to say that someone un-certified couldn&#x27;t do it, but that someone certified can, and that in critical domains only them should. A surgeon is not certified because they&#x27;re privileged, but because they&#x27;re the closest thing you can get to &quot;guaranteed not to accidentally stab you in the neck while operating&quot;. There is no free ride, where there is a cheaper alternative, there is a cheaper guarantee, and in some domains &quot;cheaper&quot; is not acceptable. The only example given is of nurses Vs physicians, an unconvincing argument since both are a self-regulated profession.<p>(I have to admit the name of their blog cracks me up every time.)",1451940966

In non-functional languages like swift, you can modify state, and closures respond to that.<p>What I think a lot of people fail to understand is that a closure is not a special object, with magical powers, but a direct consequence of lexical scoping: closures just follow the lexical scope rules, even if their lexical scope isn&#x27;t within the current dynamic scope. If a variable within the closure&#x27;s lexical scope changes, the closure won&#x27;t keep the value the same.

Webcomponents.js is small and effective.<p>This leads to a tangential point which I find somewhat interesting to ponder: If the polyfills are good enough... then why does this actually need to be a browser standard?<p>I&#x27;d <i>really</i> like to get to a place where we (collectively) find some sort of minimal API-type &quot;thing&quot; that browsers need to support such that <i>everything</i> else can be polyfilled. I would even go so far as to include things like future ES standards in that, such that you could just &quot;plug in&quot; (in the page, not the browser per se) a shim for ES2015 and it would work near-natively. I know Microsoft Research had at least one project going in this direction -- unfortunately its name escapes me at the moment.<p>> The simple click-and-select-stuff(...) that you are referencing about are probably specific to some bloated Paper elements. That&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m talking about here.<p>FWIW, that may very well be true. AFAIR all my tests were done with the paper elements.<p>I definitely agree that Web Components in <i>some</i> form is the future of application development for the web -- unless we&#x27;re talking stuff that mostly just wants to use the browser as a delivery platform like WebAssembly. Of course that may change if/when WebAssembly can interface well with the GC/DOM/etc. (Well, come to think of it Web Components might also be massively useful for authoring documents sanely using custom components for higher-level semantic elements, but that&#x27;s a digression.)<p>Just FTR as well, I have actually implemented a small application using Polymer just to get a feel for what it&#x27;s like. Overall it was reasonably pleasant as Web development goes, but it&#x27;s <i>really</i> disconcerting that all the state[1] passed down to sub-components gets represented using attributes-but-not-really-because-they&#x27;re-not-primitive-types-any-more.<p>[1] At least, that&#x27;s the idiomatic way, AFAIUI from Polymer documentation.<p>EDIT: I should edit while I can: I semi-believe that Web Components is sort of along the right lines wrt. what needs to be standardized (and perhaps WebAssembly + an interface to the WebComponents API can do the rest?), but frankly I probably don&#x27;t have <i>nearly</i> enough expertise in this field to even have an opinion.

Ne appears in Ti-Ne/Fi-Ne/Ne-Ti/Ne-Fi (what MBTI calls resp. INTP/INFP/ENTP/ENFP). In other words, the xxxP types are going to correlate with being product people. Steve Jobs was practically raw Ne.<p>The stereotyped &quot;Silicon Valley Programmer&quot; that every company wants to hire is introverted intuition primary and extraverted thinking secondary (Ni-Te, what MBTI calls INTJ). This archetype is quick-witted and naturally good at verbal/logic challenges.<p>To really, really, really simplify things, with xxxJ vs xxxP, you essentially have a dichotomy between speed on the one hand and (external) depth on the other. External depth being advantageous because the world itself is external. The current standard for interviews is essentially to judge speed, so of course this has the appropriate consequences. Which, by the nature of the particular elements involved, rapidly runaway.<p>Speed is quite easy to see and understand. Depth on the other hand is harder to pin down. But it is depth, and the vision that often carries it, that can render fine details onto a product. Those details can be so small that most people don&#x27;t see them, so general appreciation of this power is rarer, and by its nature harder to test on top of it requiring a longer time horizon to work in.<p>Many people will think that you can get both qualities in a single person, but it doesn&#x27;t work that way. Evolution would have done that long ago if it was possible. Instead, what we&#x27;re dealing with are fundamentally different brain topologies/strategies, essentially characteristics that species can min-max in individuals because of the survivability allowances afforded by their ancestors having been social.

Veterans set-asides in contracting actually do very little to help a company as there is still much legwork to be done. Even then, you stereotype veterans as &quot;rigid&quot; which is simply not at all true. I see envy in your post, not facts. Companies are NOT AT ALL &quot;paid more&quot; for having veterans on contracts. Labor rates are the same regardless of the status of the employee. You&#x27;re facilitating the spread of rumors, stereotypes and hearsay which is why people think badly of this market. Veterans are given preference for hiring, yes, because they have a skillset that too few private sector employers realize unfortunately. There are studies to prove that point.<p>Secondly, &quot;focusing on execution&quot; and not processes is why so many startups die in a growth stage because it too often means chasing revenue only with few long-term plans. The government is inherently a long-term market. You need to have a long-term view. True, if you&#x27;re developing a dog-walking app or glorified to-do list, yeah, it&#x27;s not a market for you.

Explicitly aiming to become a manager will get a bad reaction from people.<p>That said, managing people and process is a real set of skills at which people can be good or bad. You can practice and improve these skills like any others. There are plenty of people who are managers who are poor at it, but that&#x27;s no different than any other job.

Adding side training will be essential, whether it is individual courses, Udemy and similar coursework, reading, or full degree programs.<p>I think an Master&#x27;s in this &quot;Management and Project Innovation&quot; would be valuable.

That gave me some negotiation power to finally slot into a leadership role. It also rewired my brain and vastly expanded my knowledge of leadership and of understanding business concerns to be effective. It really revolutionized my whole way of thinking about the world and made me a better person in my personal and professional lives.<p>So my take would be: if your passion is in _orchestrating_ projects, do consider that MBA and angling for a Project Manageer role as well. But you should also get a year or several of software development so you learn the realities of people working on software projects. I think practical experience is important to stay grounded when you get with with management theories and practices. Without real-world experience anchoring you, it can turn you into a Pointy-Haired Boss personality.<p>If you already think that is going to be an interest to you, I encourage you to go work 2+ years as a software engineer, then start a Master&#x27;s degree concurrently after you have some experience.<p>Email me if you want to talk in more detail.",1451940227

No antibiotics, antivirals, no heart surgery, warfarin,  etc.  For almost all of human history faith healing was the first line treatment for everything and now people are pissed.<p>People get pissed off driving and don&#x27;t think it is a miracle that we have cars, roads, gas, mechanics,  etc.<p>Anyway you&#x27;ve got to get over this idea that any generation is special;  often it is much more like 10% of the boomers did it,  and 30% of X,  and 50% of Y and 70% of the Millenials do it -- most generational change is a &quot;diffusion of innovation&quot; situation.<p>If you want to understand the post 2000 period you have to understand the 1960s and 1970s and a good book from that era is<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/uncommitted-alienated-youth-American-society/dp/B0006BMZYC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/uncommitted-alienated-youth-American-s...</a><p>and it explains a lot of things like the hippie phenomenon and then the cult boom,  school shooters and why people who don&#x27;t have it bad join ISIS,  all that.  It is also the first academic book to use the word &quot;postmodern&quot;.<p>He says &quot;Our age inspires scant enthusiasm.&quot; and that is it.  People don&#x27;t really believe anything they are told and just go through the motions.  For instance,  look at defined contribution pensions.  There has been Republican FUD against Social Security since it began,  and now we have these private plans which might work if people had money to put in them,  and some of us are fortunate enough to do so,  but a lot of people live paycheck to paycheck -- personally I still think investing in the stock market is the best massy thing to do,  but looking at the chart of the last 20 years I am not going to blame anybody who thinks it is a casino.<p>People are not committed,  they are not engaged,  they don&#x27;t feel like stakeholders,  they don&#x27;t feel that they are valued,  they see organizations such as schools,  colleges,  the military,  corporations as exploitative,  treating people like racehorses,  burning them out,  throwing them away.<p>At my local startup incubator there was this conversation I just couldn&#x27;t take from some guy who had all this bullshit and weird ideas about networking and at some point it&#x27;s like &quot;bud...  if you are talking to a VC they want to hear you are working on product and talking to customers&quot;<p>Yet,  disengaged people see something like &quot;Y Combinator&quot; and they see it like Harvard Business School,  a credential,  social proof because if you are disengaged you aren&#x27;t experiencing the joy of learning,  creating,  etc.",1451939601

That is, a degree translates to N years of experience in the real world. In reality (at least according to my experience), the MBA degree is merely a ticket to an interview. If you got your MBA in Management and Project Innovation, you might have a leg up on non-MBA holders, but you&#x27;ll still wind up with a bit of trial-by-fire, since you don&#x27;t have a lot of real world experience. Plus, grad school can be expensive.<p>Another route would be to go straight into the workforce and do some real-world software engineering. You&#x27;ll find out really fast whether the coding-to-decision ratio is good enough for you, or whether you really want to move up into management. As others will tell you, management is a whole different animal. For most technically minded people like software engineers, they usually only want to make technical decisions. Managers, on the other hand, have to think about a lot more, especially on the business and people side of things.<p>Find a mentor and learn as much as you can. At first, this should merely be a lead engineer. They&#x27;ll have experience making decisions AND the technical chops to back it up. If you reach the position of Lead Engineer and you still want to get into management, find another mentor.

Evan talks a lot about the decisions that went into the language, such as not having type classes or other advanced features. He makes a strong case for Elm not as a language-to-rule-them-all, but as a tool for the average programmer, who is more interested in building things than in learning about theory. The myriad language features in Haskell, OCaml, etc. are wonderful to those who understand them, but have not proven to be particularly effective at attracting those who aren&#x27;t already interested in the languages. In that talk, he really made a strong case as to why Elm is valuable and relevant, even for someone such as myself, a functional programming nerd who loves learning about type theory, abstract algebra, and similar things.<p>Also, I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to say &quot;The amount of people using Elm right now is a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of people using OCaml (and F#, in more recent years).&quot; OCaml has been around for almost 20 years now, and F# for more than 10.

If you’re a tinkerer, you enjoy breaking more than building, or someone who wonders “why” and ends up down the rabbit hole 36 hours later with a disassembled air conditioning unit surrounding them... we’d love to hear from you! Our process welcomes those with years of experience, as well as those with little to no direct experience in what we do.<p>The bottom line: if you love security and research, NCC Group just may be a perfect fit for you.<p>What do we do exactly? Penetration testing, security analysis, and cutting-edge research into current technologies and attacks (breaking things). You spend most of your day thinking about security systems and how they can break. You get to be creative and have a lot of freedom to be clever while learning new technologies at a very fast pace. Engagements are usually 2-4 weeks long and in a year you will be exposed to 15-20 products and technology stacks. Your work will typically initiate person-months of security improvements in products millions of people use. You will have access to senior engineers/architects and your findings/ideas will be heard by senior decision makers. You will have enormous impact in making the software people use safer.

So one might as well say the Stasi wasn&#x27;t centralized because it consisted of innumerable spooks and informants. Think of it as &quot;The Stasi Cloud&quot; or something, if that helps. Nothing is truly centralized, if you split hairs enough.<p>> snitches tend to report &quot;bad&quot; things only, information you volunteer about yourself tends to be &quot;good&quot; things only<p>We&#x27;re not talking about information that is volunteered when openly asked though. And besides, that&#x27;s besides the point. It is still a trampling on basic human rights on pretty much a global scale, by all sorts of nations and private entities.<p>When I cannot communicate with anyone by phone, email, or a social website they can be bothered to use, then I do not have the right to have private friendships much less any means to organize politically to step on any powerful toes. I can&#x27;t be a free human being without other free human beings. So do I have that right, or not?<p>Sure, we got engineered into falling into trap voluntarily.

This can occur within a monolithic bureaucracy, but how much more so in a dog eat dog just doing my job world. And it&#x27;s a very big factor in such things.<p>You don&#x27;t <i>need</i> strict, obvious centralization when you have enough people following along voluntarily, or making up their own little rationalizations why they do any of the 1000 voluntary things that ultimately all serve you more than them. You need enough people, and enough technology to multiply their power, and the rest just needs to be passive and/or divided.<p>You might convince me that there are several smaller and bigger Stasis, some with just a little power, others with more, and that they overlap and differ in various ways. Just like the actual people the actual Stasi consisted of did. But other than that, I disagree on all points.<p>The desire of people to be free from surveillance by practically unaccountable people who pull shit like wars of aggression, abductions, assassinations, can never be &quot;dangerous&quot; enough. Yes, crying wolf is also not productive, but I honestly think we&#x27;re beyond that. There&#x27;s <i>something</i> in the pen, and the only way to see how friendly or dangerous it is, is to call it out. If we&#x27;re too scared to even do that, to enforce human rights no matter who goes there, it just might be a wolf.<p>I mean, how &quot;should&quot; things be addressed?

PureScript takes the approach of providing a full Haskell-like language that is &quot;native&quot; to the JS world. It has the features and type system of Haskell, but atop a cleaned up version of Javascript&#x27;s semantics (e.g. strict evaluation, not lazy, by default). It&#x27;s also well suited for both server and client code, and even has a C++11 backend in the works in addition to the native JS backend.<p>In contrast, Elm is focused on front-end work and is less expressive, but emphasizes simplicity. Elm&#x27;s goal of figuring out how to simplify and distill the Haskell and ML world&#x27;s abstractions is an admirable one, but as an experienced programmer interested in practical work I&#x27;d rather just go with PureScript and just learn the Haskell-like abstractions along the way. It also really helps that the PureScript compiler&#x27;s javascript output is &quot;natural&quot; and easy to understand, without any mysterious transformations involved.<p>Have others looked at PureScript, Elm, Haste, GHCJS, etc and chosen differently?",1451938788

That wouldn&#x27;t work too well, though mostly because &quot;half-failed&quot; is actually nearly already failed.<p>This seems like the kind of thing that could use a &quot;calibration curve&quot;—where you observe how the reported health actually correlates to the remaining MBTF, and then divide future reported-health estimates by that correlation-curve to get their actual health.<p>I&#x27;m guessing the calibration curve will just, itself, end up being a bathtub curve—which means that e.g. a drive with one or two SMART errors would need to be considered &quot;already on its way out.&quot; But sometimes such drives live a long time—as a matter of cost, it&#x27;s probably too expensive to throw out every disk that will <i>probabilistically</i> fail soon. It might be possible, though, to move them to some sort of &quot;non-front-line&quot; service instead, maybe moved to Dynamo-like n=17 highly-redundant storage. (I wonder if AWS actually &quot;recycles&quot; EBS volumes into Dynamo/S3 volumes this way.)<p>---<p>As an aside, I&#x27;ve always wondered why we don&#x27;t use calibration curves more. They&#x27;re great for estimating a lot of things:<p>• Remaining battery life: <i>sort of</i> works this way (in that battery <i>output</i> is fairly constant until the battery &quot;runs out&quot;; 10% remaining = battery at a slightly lower voltage, 0% remaining = battery still plenty charged but no longer charged enough to output the proper voltage for the device.) But could be calibrated way better by actually correlating reported battery life to time, as observed by the device during its service life. This is made harder because we don&#x27;t usually let batteries drain dry, though we <i>do</i> let them get into that precarious 10% &quot;suboptimal voltage&quot; case quite often. A properly-calibrated battery report should discharge linearly and recharge on an S-curve, rather than the other way &#x27;round.<p>• Progress bars. If you&#x27;re an OS manufacturer and you want to distribute an OS update, deploy it to a bunch of test machines and track how long each phase of the update takes, average them a bit pessimistically (maybe take the third-sigma median.) Now you can make a progress bar that <i>appears</i> to fill linearly, and gives a <i>real, calibrated</i> estimate on time-to-completion. The bar can be fronting pretty oblivious software, as long as it&#x27;s split into phases itself: each phase can be kicked off and then the bar can just ease between N% and (N+P)% over the (pessimistically) estimated phase time, quickly cubic-sliding up to (N+P)% if the phase completes early. (I do know one piece of software that actually did things this way: Mac OS, pre-System-7.)",1451938752

Right now, you get discounts for eg the sensors in your volvo that warn about vehicles next to you if you turn your blinkers on.  Autonomous driving will be like that but on steroids.  Insurers will rapidly price in cost falls from autonomous driving.<p>A second huge cost increase to non-autonomous driving will come from juries.  Right now, as a society, we accept car accidents as part of the cost of a modern society because there is no alternative to heavy use of vehicles.  Humans driving cars means you will inevitably have accidents.  Even if you kill someone in an accident, as long as there isn&#x27;t negligence on your part, you generally will have nothing happen to you besides increased insurance costs.  The second there is an alternative to a human driving, I expect civil juries to start returning large awards and laws to change to include jail sentences.

TS is bad because it&#x27;s not an &#x27;official&#x27; standard and it may be an awkward transition for existing JS devs.<p>TS is not required, I have been writing an Angular2 app in strictly ES6 despite the lack of documentation/support.<p>Both: require transpilation; use observables (ie redux vs rxjs); use a HTML-like templating language for data binding; use the virtual DOM to speed up rendering; discourage mutating the DOM directly to encourage rendering on other platforms (ie mobile, isomorphic); require platform-specific shims that don&#x27;t touch the DOM; etc...<p>The underlying technologies of both are more similar than different. React favors a more decentralized architecture. Angular2 favors a more monolithic architecture.<p>/axegrinding",1451938009

External names are part of the API, local names are part of the implementation. It often makes sense to make them the same, but there are case where you want them to be different, and what&#x27;s wrong with that? It&#x27;s ultimately no different from loading a parameter into a local variable of a different name and then operating on that local variable.<p>Then why have it in the first place? That seems like a very odd feature to put front and center into the language (considering a very similar effect can be achieved with a few assignments as the function&#x27;s prelude) and require using when just wanting positional-only parameters, or consistently labelled parameters.",1451937639

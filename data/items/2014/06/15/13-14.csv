7895228,comment,7894816,7895198,2,0,kevingadd,,,"So you go directly from &#x27;doesn&#x27;t warrant a full diagnosis&#x27; to &#x27;doesn&#x27;t exist&#x27;? What exactly are you suggesting here? Are you saying it&#x27;s not a spectrum of symptoms, from mild to severe, and that there is a bucket of people with &#x27;no depression&#x27; and a bucket of people with &#x27;real depression&#x27;? What is your basis for such a statement?<p>Otherwise, you&#x27;re agreeing that there is a spectrum of symptoms, but somehow the symptoms on the milder end of the spectrum &#x27;don&#x27;t actually exist&#x27;?<p>A diagnosis is different from a prescription. Just because you have a diagnosis of depression doesn&#x27;t mean you automatically need to take antidepressants; the diagnosis is used as a tool to understand the general set of symptoms you might experience and what the treatment methods are.<p>Again, depression is not &#x27;abnormal&#x27; emotion or &#x27;abnormal&#x27; feelings. Neither are the effects of bipolar. They are both &#x27;normal&#x27; and entirely natural biological mechanisms, the <i>problem</i> is that those mechanisms are acting to an atypical degree and causing negative side-effects. In many cases the treatment methods are also entirely &#x27;natural&#x27;, not involving any pharmaceuticals.<p>Another way to put this: It is normal for someone to become depressed in response to tough circumstances or disappointment. It&#x27;s normal for someone to get amped up and slightly manic in response to stress or an immediate threat. Those are natural mechanisms.<p>When the depression or stress response lasts for days or weeks, that is where it starts to enter into territory where a physician might diagnose it as clinical depression, or hypomania, or mania. Again, the problem is not <i>the feelings</i>, it&#x27;s the duration and magnitude of the feelings - the feelings and physical effects lasting well after the initial triggers are gone.",1402840420

7895205,comment,7893440,7893896,2,0,nmrm,,,"First -- I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wise or useful to judge Ph.D.&#x27;s by the same standards as industrial developers. Or vice versa. Consider the corresponding criticism of industry: &quot;have you meet some of these jokers in industry? Most of them couldn&#x27;t pass the qualifiers even after like 5 years doing CS full time. WTH?! It&#x27;s almost like like haven&#x27;t learned much new theory or math since graduating from undergrad or something...&quot;)<p>Second -- and this is purely based upon my personal experience (perhaps we have worked with people in radically different departments or research areas) -- what you say is simply not true in most cases.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with a lot of theory people, and did not encounter any really bad programmers.<p>Your specific criticisms:<p>1. version control. Everyone uses it for everything. Even and especially paper writing. If your experience is that theory phds don&#x27;t use version control, then I would say your department is/was abnormal (or else we&#x27;ve observed people in very different parts of theory, I suppose).<p>But also, in many cases, using VCS is more religious than practical. Academic projects are often <10kloc single dev projects. It&#x27;s more of a useful additional backup mechanism than actually necessary.<p>2. Testing. If the paper contains a full spec and correctness proof for the implementation (e.g. inference rules, automata, algorithm in terms of some mathematical object) then the point of the implementation is really just transliteration. The space for potential bugs is still there, but the bugs are very different from typical bugs (which, imho, are most often due to poor/vague or even completely absent specification). You simply need fewer unit tests when you <i>know</i> that precisely the thing you are implementing is correct, and just want to make sure you copied things down correctly.<p>3. The code is often well-written. When it is not, two problems are most common:<p>a. no comments! Okay, but of course there is a 20 page paper explaining the core idea. And also it&#x27;s a protoype.<p>b. Bad structure/poor abstractions. Again, most prototypes don&#x27;t need to be maintainable. If the core idea gets big and important, it probably makes sense to reimplement as part of a new research agenda anyways (e.g. for performance reasons, or because of unforeseen extensions due to scientific advances, etc). Also, in some cases, the correct way to organize a piece of academic software is highly non-obvious. Organizing your code is much easier when it&#x27;s a completely solved technical problem in search for new social applications (yet another web app) than when it&#x27;s a completely new technical idea.",1402839525
7895204,comment,7894825,7894825,14,0,mattdeboard,,,"I was the public affairs chief for Regimental Combat Team 6 (USMC), with a &quot;territory&quot; covering half of Al Anbar Province including Fallujah & Ramadi in 2007. I met scores of journalists and had high level visibility into the Marines&#x27; handling of journalists in Iraq.<p>The first thing I want to say is that Manning is describing the Army&#x27;s approach to journalism coverage. It is quite different from the Marines&#x27; approach, which as far as I could tell (and from my vantage point I was in a good position to have a clear understanding) was extremely open. I do not recall any cases of &quot;blacklisting&quot; or otherwise limiting access of journalists to events, leaders or units in our area of operations (AO). I did hear stories about how the Army was handling it and it was, in typical Army fashion, being handled very poorly. I realize this might sound like glib &quot;Semper Fi&quot; jingoism but you&#x27;ll have to trust me there was a real difference. (BTW the Marine Corps isn&#x27;t guiltless, I&#x27;m sure, but during my time I was pretty proud of our commitment to openness.)<p>Second, about the tally of reporters. In 2010 the coverage had wound almost completely down because frankly the American people had lost interest. Even in 2007 the number of embed requests we received declined when &quot;peace broke out&quot; during the Anbar &quot;awakening&quot;. There&#x27;s no reason to think that the reason the official count of embeds never rose above 12 (if that&#x27;s true) because of official limitations. Instead I think it&#x27;s pretty reasonable to think that is because most embeds would have been quite boring at the time, relatively speaking. It was much easier to sit inside the Green Zone in Baghdad and report from there.<p>I don&#x27;t really have a punchy conclusion to put here. Basically, don&#x27;t believe everything is black or white in this matter. Like everything it was/is a complicated system with a lot of moving parts, and to clump it all into some homogenous bucket is basically give up on actually understanding.",1402839525

Keep in mind, I&#x27;m only critiquing the way the article was written, not oolite.  Oolite is a fun and well designed game.  Also I might commit the same sin as the author, and credit FFE for the introduction of a feature when I should be crediting FE2.  Let&#x27;s run down the list.<p>> If you sit outside a station, you can watch many ships entering and leaving to their destinations, watch as a fugitive decides to attack a vulnerable trader, and is attacked by the system police, or scoops up its ill gotten gains. ... These things will happen regardless as to whether you are there or not. THAT!.. is one of the major points that differentiates between the two games, which makes oOlite a game of its own.<p>This was more or less in the original (Acorn) Elite and was absolutely in Frontier.<p>> oOlite brings new roles and perspectives to fill that seat from the outset, such as transporting clients (should you have a passenger bay fitted) from one system to another, or delivering packages to earn credits<p>Entirely from Frontier.<p>> One example as to the massive improvements within oOlite compared to any other Space Trading Game could be the career of a miner.  ... after purchasing a fuel Scoop, an item intended to scoop fuel gravitational matter from the Suns, but also found to scoop all items with matter, such as CargoPods (ejected from traders you’ve attacked, or that you’ve come across after someone else’s misfortune), also pieces of Asteroids found in Space, broken up with a mining laser<p>&quot;Compared to any other&quot; except for the original Elite, which had all of those.  And Elite 2 and Elite 3.<p>> the forthcoming release of Elite: Dangerous (the official sequel to the Original Elite game By David Braben: see a recent E3 2014 trailer on youtube)<p>Well these extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.  I was pretty sure &quot;Frontier Elite II&quot; was &quot;the official sequel&quot;.  Oh, linked the source is just gameplay footage, no voice-over retconning FE2 out of existence.<p>> Within the vast regions of Space and the thousands of planets, there are many different systems of Government ...<p>Once again, not original and entirely from Elite.<p>The next couple of paragraphs are well written, explaining actual original features or giving credit to Elite when appropriate.  I would have no complaints if the entire article was written in the same style as the sections about missions, expansions, backgrounds, and towing.<p>> Elite gave a new realm of “choices” in a game. Then came oOlite, which took hold of the idea of Elite, transforming it into something huge<p>... But it quickly falls back into a revisionist history.<p>> It is without doubt, the best Space Trading game freely available, and is, in the opinion of the writer, everything that Elite wished to be, and with the advent of OXPs, everything that the new Elite: Dangerous wants to be but can’t.<p>Considering that &quot;Elite: Dangerous&quot; is only half done, a bold claim.<p>Other un-credited things that were in other Elite games first (but were more awkward/lengthy to quote) include the story-driven news feeds, jump tracking, a table of prices, and in-game ads.<p>Basically, if you edited out 20% of the article it could be about FFE.  30% of the article and it could be about the original Elite.

I would argue that the industry is in practice being far too loose with the definition of &quot;significant impact on one&#x27;s lives&quot;.  I think articles like this one blur the line even further by making it sound like everyone who has experienced a few of these symptoms suffers from depression.  People read stuff like this and then start telling themselves &quot;I&#x27;m depressed&quot; and because of this mistaken belief many of them wind up being medicated inappropriately.<p>This epidemic of over-diagnosis has reached such vast proportions that I imagine the majority of people in the tech industry have been prescribed some kind of psychotropic drug to treat some form of mental illness at some point in their life. I wish I could get accurate statistics on this to prove my point.<p>As a side note I do think that caffeine induced psychosis is 100% real (because it&#x27;s a very powerful drug) and the symptoms often mimic that of depression or bi-polar and can even be inclusive of phenomena such as hallucination.  I don&#x27;t have any credentials but my opinion as a layperson is that I think it&#x27;s incredibly irresponsible to write a prescription or to give a diagnosis  for any mental illness to a patient who has not first completely cut caffeine out of their lives.",1402838637

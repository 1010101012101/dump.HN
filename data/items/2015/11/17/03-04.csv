And success, especially in that industry, is far from guaranteed. There are some critical breakthroughs they would need to make just to compete with the likes of Intel on even their low-mid range processors. Most of their designs are propriety which means China&#x27;s computer initiative is going to be starting from scratch. That means they&#x27;re starting at a point which puts them behind everyone else by <i>at least</i> 10-13 years or more. And still, there&#x27;s no guarantee they&#x27;ll ever come close to catching up. It&#x27;s a huge $47B gamble on their part, which is almost certainly why they haven&#x27;t done it sooner. That&#x27;s a lot of money to lose, even for China, if they bust.<p>And I know some of you are thinking, &quot;Well, they&#x27;ll just steal the tech! Espionage baby!&quot; Sorry, but that too, is unlikely. Due to China&#x27;s recent aggressive tech grabs over the last decade or two, companies have &quot;wised up&quot; to IP theft and go to extreme measures to protect their assets. Some of those protections rival or even exceed the U.S governments. China&#x27;s wild west days of stealing everyone else&#x27;s IPs are winding down.",1447732708

Intent is relevant to drafting a response, but not to the public fear. Intent without resources or sophistication is also not meaningful. It is further stated that they are special because they&#x27;re attacks on the social order. Yet this is a truism, because they only have such an effect if people permit themselves to make it so.

If you serve as a panelist and you rank grant proposals highly that ultimately don&#x27;t meet success criteria down the road (spawning high-profile publications, generating citations, coming in under-budget, whatever...) that should reflect badly upon you as a panelist, in a public way. And over time, your &quot;score&quot; as a panelist would modulate the extent to which your rankings are weighted in a panel discussion. Similar to how each major European football league gets a coefficient from UEFA, and based on the coefficients, the number of direct and playoff slots into the Champion&#x27;s League tournament is decided.<p>Imagine if academics who want to serve on a panel must agree to also have such a &#x27;coefficient&#x27; published about them. Now, their ranking is something they must openly bet their reputation upon, and over time those who place correct bets will be given more weight when panels select grants.<p>Obviously this isn&#x27;t perfect. The coefficient scheme could be manipulated in the same way that network connections lead to manipulation of the rankings as it is now. If we don&#x27;t trust the central body measuring and adjusting the coefficients, that would be a problem (cough... FIFA).<p>But still, wouldn&#x27;t some version of this idea -- making academics pay a public reputation price in order to vote for their preferred funding recipients -- be better than letting people rank and vote without reputation effects? In theory, it should also mean that only those with a real stake in the decision will risk the reputation price to vote -- and you could imagine even beginning to open up grant funding decisions to much wider voting bodies. Instead of a small panel, just drop all of the proposals onto a site like arXiv, and allow absolutely anyone at all to vote -- so long as the weight of their vote corresponds to their public score, and that their future score will be affected by the success/failure of whatever they vote for. No more small / closed-off committees, just open speculative voting like a prediction market.",1447730371

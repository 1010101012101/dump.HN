Investors invest, and they want money out of it.  As long as it's  legal, anything goes to get that profit.<p>In a charity the bottom line is providing some much less tangible benefit to someone or something.  The bottom line is a much fuzzier concept.  The benefit is harder to gauge than when you're just looking at a number of currency units.",1230227933

Housing lotteries (the city buys 50% of a house for a few lucky people), bloated salaries for MTA workers, dance police (1), and most programs are extremely inefficient (housing projects in manhattan? why not move them to Jamaica, and save money?).<p>Perhaps NY could spend that extra 15% effectively. But it would probably just be wasted.<p>(1) If patrons dance or sway to music in a bar without a cabaret license, the police will ticket the bar owner.

I met so many people who called themselves ""writers"", but if I asked to read something they'd written, they hadn't produced a single complete work they'd call their best effort.<p>Once you really put it out there, for all to see, you have to let go of your fantasy about how great you are and confront the reality that this really does represent you as a writer.<p>It's so similar with code and programmers.  There are so many people who like talking about what it means to be a programmer, what it means to write code... but you aren't a real programmer until you put something out there, warts and all, and say ""yep, this is my work, for better and for worse.""",1230226749

409650,comment,408786,409306,0,0,Hoff,,,"Correct.<p>If you're looking to assign blame, then do evaluate your own particular motivations.  You have probably already made or you are now about to make a mistake; you've taken your eye off your particular goals of creating value for your customers.<p>Certainly don't repeat (unprofitable) mistakes.  Do learn from your own mistakes, and do particularly learn from the mistakes of others.<p>Competing against an organization that seeks to place blame on others?  Now that's a potential business opportunity.  That individual or that organization is not competing effectively.  They're dissipating their competitive efforts.  They're potentially vulnerable.  Do you have a wedge here?  An opening?  Use it.<p>Do continue to move toward where the target business will be, regardless.  Whatever goal or profit here you might view as your motivation.  Blame doesn't move you toward that goal.",1230226147

I was slim and athletic - used to walk 5 miles a day, do weight-training and cycling, etc.  Then 6 years ago I moved in my chair in the office and had a feeling like an electric current travel up my spine.  It was months before I could turn my head without pain, and  in the following years I've suffered terrible back, pelvis, and hip pains, and it's getting worse.  I cannot really sit upright, and now even have trouble walking.  No doctor can explain how all this began or even if the various problems are connected - and even when they have some 'treatment' the odds are even as to whether it makes matters better or worse.<p>So please, if you value a normal life, take care of yourself and don't sit too long without breaks.  It won't matter how much money you make if you can't enjoy an evening at the cinema or can't go for a walk when on holiday.",1230226041

This impairs my productivity, to say nothing of quality of life.  I try to avoid this by keeping one of those disposable water bottles (I like the Glaceau SmartWater ones best) close at hand.  I'll use the same bottle for weeks or months, just refilling it from the tap.  I try to drink at least three per day.  Eating fruits and vegetables and exercising helps me feel better and stay focused too but I don't do those enough.",1230225810

409642,comment,409562,409562,0,0,newt0311,,,"Wow. An editorial on the NY that makes significant economic sense and goes against the liberal ideology. This is a first.<p>On the op-ed itself. I don't understand why anybody considers  profit evil if said profit is not gotten through fraud or coercion. Exactly what is so evil about making money? Furthermore, all donations to charity are completely voluntary <i>and private</i>. Whether for-profit charities are evil or not is not something to the public at large to decide. We have no business passing judgment on any charity unless we happen to be one of the donors (and even then, clauses from their contracts apply). Lastly: if I was donating to a charity, I would not be concerned by how much they got in profit or how much their chief manager was paid. I would be interested in what I was giving them money for: how effective they were is helping the people they claimed to help.",1230225623

It is not superstition.<p>I don't know where you got the idea that I was recommending a non-physical holding of gold or silver, but it is a good point to address:  all COMEX contracts state that in the event of default (non-delivery) they can just give you USD, which of course is exactly what you don't want.",1230224837

These tools are adoptable by almost anyone and if you use them you shine a giant spotlight into the previously dimly lit area of your system configurations. You get documentation, testability and version control of your infra. It&#x27;s extremely liberating.<p>One of the most valuable things has turned out to be the ability to refactor infra as a project evolves.

8101274,comment,8100692,8101188,1,0,Ashwinning,,,"Well, display hardware isn&#x27;t the problem. 4K, 8K, there&#x27;s no end to it.\nCascaded displays using multiplied layers seem to help achieve benefits like sharpness at super high resolutions & effectively smoother results at low frames per second (staggered) video playback.\nThis helps remove a major obstacle that high-res display technologies will face in the short term, which is processing power.\nPresently, high-end graphics cards can barely crank out 30 FPS at 4K resolutions for games. Also, any compression artifacts etc. in textures are much more pronounced on high-res/big sized displays. While requiring the need to change the workflow (of game development) a little bit, cascaded displays can potentially help render higher resolution, better quality/sharper images at lower frame-rates (i.e. much more cheaply) while still providing that 60fps feel.<p>Personally, if this takes off, I can see it saving the XBox One&#x27;s ass, as a lot of the complaints from gamers have been regarding it&#x27;s inferior capabilities for rendering high-end games (It renders many games at 720p 30 frames/second, while Playstation 4 is able to crank out 1080p for the same titles), and also, play another factor in prolonging the shelf life of the present generation of consoles, by enabling them to deliver much better graphics with the same hardware. Kind of like what Normal Maps (among other things) did for Xbox 360 & PS3, you can see the difference in graphics between a game released in 2005 vs a game released in 2013 on the same hardware. Among a lot of other factors, that was why it took 7 years before we saw the next generation of consoles being released. Comparatively, the Xbox 360 came out within 4 years of the release of the original Xbox.<p>TL;DR - It&#x27;s not about the display hardware itself, it&#x27;s about the ease of rendering graphics to meet the demands of high-end display.",1406624040

Possibly the HN effect?<p>Anyway - that aside this is an absolutely brilliant idea and fixes a real pain point for me. After spending so long on the app that I&#x27;ve started to hate it, doing all the screenshots, videos, etc. is bad enough - but then you have to do the website as well and it just makes you feel like - &quot;urgh, really? CSS mangling time? Blergh.&quot; I would easily pay some of my hard earned indie cash to just have it done for me. Some thoughts:<p>- I&#x27;m going to want to integrate whatever site you create into my own website, so I just want to download whatever you have and throw it into a div container and have it work. Which means there shouldn&#x27;t be any/many dependencies on CSS frameworks / JavaScript etc. It should be clean.<p>- If I&#x27;m going to give you my cash I&#x27;m going to want to be able to choose from a LOT of different themes so that I can differentiate my app from all the others out there. I don&#x27;t mind doing some of the simple customization myself (colours, text, etc.). I&#x27;m not going to want to pay each time if all it comes down to is changing the logo / picture / text when I could easily do that myself.<p>- I don&#x27;t know how you plan to monetize, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay monthly for this. I just don&#x27;t churn out apps fast enough (other people might want to though, of course). But I would be prepared to pay a fair bit each time if it looks good enough.

8101179,comment,8099713,8100968,7,0,Perseids,,,"Re: Length extensions<p>Tldr: The length extension property of the Sha2 family has nothing to do with collisions. If you are afraid of future cryptanlytic breakthroughs regarding the collision resistance of Sha2 use the concatenation of SHA-256 and SHA3-256.<p>You are mightily confused about the connection of length extensions and collisions. (Bear with me, I know you are already familiar with length extensions, but I need to introduce the notation to explain your misunderstanding. Also it is nice to introduce the other readers to the topic.) All actually used cryptographic hash functions are iterative hash functions. That is the message is first padded to a multiple of the block size and then cut into blocks b_1,...,b_n. The core of the hash function is a compression function c (or maybe we should better call it mix-in function if we also have the Sha3 winner Keccak in mind) that takes the internal state i_k and a block b_k+1 and outputs the new internal state i_k+1: i_k+1=c(i_k,b_k+1). The hash function has a pre-defined initial state i_0. At last there is a finalization function f that takes the last internal state i_n (the state after processing the last message block) and outputs the result of the hash function. MD5, SHA1 and the SHA2 family have the problem that the finalization step is just the identity function, i.e. i_n is directly used as output of the hash function. Thus if you take the output you can continue the hash chain directly and calculate the hash of a longer message b_1,...,b_n,b_n+1,...,b_n+m.<p>Normally this is not that interesting (you could have just calculated the hash of the long message directly and avoided problems with padding that I&#x27;m ignoring to keep it simple). But in some situations you might not actually <i>know</i> b_1,...,b_n. For example if you calculate an authentication tag as t=h(k||m) where k is secret key you share with the API and m is the message you want to authenticate. As t is published an attacker an pickup the internal state i_n=t and calculate the authentication tag of an extension: t2=i_n+m=h(k||m||m2) authenticates m||m2. Twitter had this problem with its API: <a href=""http://vnhacker.blogspot.de/2009/09/flickrs-api-signature-forgery.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vnhacker.blogspot.de/2009/09/flickrs-api-signature-fo...</a> . If you want to do authentication tags right, use HMAC: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authenticat...</a><p>Now a collision describes the case where two messages b_1,...,b_n and d_1,...,d_m produce the same hash, i.e. the output of the finalization function is identical. As SHA2 does not have a finalization function and I would not believe that collisions in SHA3 would only be possible in the finalization step (squeezing step in the terminology of the Keccak sponge function) if it is possible at all I&#x27;ll ignore it as a source for collisions for the moment. Thus a collisions means that after processing the k blocks of b_1,...,b_k and the l blocks d_1,...,d_l the internal state is identical. As the hash function is iterative we can continue both block lists with identical blocks e_1,...,e_j and still have the same internal state. As the state is identical it does not matter which finalization function we apply the output is identical and b_1,...,b_k,e_1,...,e_j and d_1,...,d_l,e_1,...,e_j hash to same value. Thus whenever you have one collision in the internal state you can always produce infinitely many colliding messages. This property is independent of the finalization function and blake2, Sha-384, Skein as well as Sha3 allow such attacks (once one collision is found). If anything a fancy finalization function can make things worse by mapping two different internal states to the same output. But because of the problems with the length extension attacks (see twitter) a one-way finalization function is a standard requirement for hash functions nowadays.<p>If you are really concerned about future cryptanalysis of SHA2 you can spread the risk on several hash functions where each has to be broken to break the security of the overall construction. These are called hash combiners. The most simple one is the concatenation of two hashes: Sha256(m)||Sha3-256(m). This one will be collision resistant if either Sha256 or Sha3-256 is collision resistant. There are also combiners for other properties, like pseudo randomness, and also multi-property combiners. See for example <a href=""http://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/2094/1/thesis.lehmann.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/2094/1/thesis.lehmann.pd...</a> .",1406621580

One of use-case for Razor: pop-in a new server into the rack, get provision ESXi with Razor and then provision a number of CentOS and Debian VMs without having to care how different is Kickstart from Preseed. It&#x27;s a great too, but it&#x27;s mostly for private cloud and Teraform is for public cloud and is therefore at a higher level.",1406621227

I suspect that there is a relatively bigger risk of people having that intent in the financial industry than elsewhere, since scamming people without being detected is a lot easier (and probably more tempting) when money itself is the product.",1406620961

8101156,comment,8100521,8100521,2,0,golergka,,,"> Top lists reward apps that get people to download them, regardless of quality or long-term use, so that’s what most developers optimize for.<p>Actually, that&#x27;s where the in-app purchases come in. As every free2play game developer will tell you, the key to good monetization is updating your app and engage the community. Produce new content, throw seasonal promotions and sales, fix bugs, keep the game alive.<p>That&#x27;s exactly because you care about the overall LTV of the user, not the download event — and, as free2play developer, my task is not to lure the user to pay $1 to download it, but to convince the user to pay while he&#x27;s already in it. There are developers that buy installs for $10 a piece from a certain sources, and they make a great profit out of it — just because once the user gets there, he&#x27;ll pay more. Not because anyone will force him to; it&#x27;s impossible to force the user to do anything, we don&#x27;t a gun to his head — but because he wants to.<p>May be the app developers, too, will finally go to the same route?",1406620917

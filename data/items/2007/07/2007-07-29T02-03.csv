Lots of design has to do with beauty, which almost by definition isn't easily quantifiable. <p>Another issue is the complexity of the problem, which might make convergence on even a semi-optimal solution difficult or extremely time consuming to find. Complexity, even of a quantitative problem, makes for difficult objective functions. Different dimensions of optimization require fairly arbitrary weighting.<p>But the future is still exciting. iRobot is working on a new software architecture for robotics, called Aware2. It will allow EA to permute fairly high level pieces of code and behaviors. The system is still under development, but it has great potential. If you're curious, it is in C++ for component speed with boost.Python for glue & configuration. Similar systems can be made for other complex problems, not just robotics.

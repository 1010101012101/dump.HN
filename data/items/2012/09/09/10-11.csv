4495514,comment,4495128,4495128,4,0,digisth,,,"I agree with most of this well-written post. However, I think this deserves consideration: some percentage of those posters are not, will not, and do not want to be developers. They may be the accountant who is the designated ""IT guy"" in the office because he is able to unjam the printer or the office assistant/intern who is being given the ""do this miscellaneous stuff we don't understand"" task and has no idea where to even begin.<p>It may be hard to believe in this day and age, but there are still companies out there that have no idea that they even <i>need</i> real technical help (and might not be able to pay for it if they did.) Some of you who have done freelance custom software development work for small/long-lived businesses trying to come into the modern world may have seen this phenomenon (I've seen it plenty of times when I freelanced regularly.) The examples used in the post may not fit this, but plenty of SO questions I've read could fit this pattern.<p>If we /were/ able to be truly frank about it, we would perhaps  suggest that they talk to their boss about hiring a professional developer (or Sysadmin, in the case of Server Fault) to do the job that they've been unwillingly thrown into. (edit: There's perhaps a great opportunity to connect small businesses with freelance developers/custom dev shops buried in here somewhere.)",1347187905

I don't like the ex CEO of godaddy much, but 'security is for corpses' is definitely something he was right about. When you are born, you are almost dead. There is no reason to be so careful; I mean, don't drunk-drive or inject yourself with random stuff to get a maybe-high, but doing only stuff you like? Whats the harm in that? You're going to die if there is a mistake? No, you'll have a maybe temporary hard time. At least you did what you like. It's incredible what small amount of people actually do this.

I'd love if this integrated with SpringPad (which I prefer over Evernote), either by formatting for their e-mails or preferably through their API. IFTTT does neither.<p>If this allowed anonymous analytics in order to discover and suggest useful rules, either at the personal level or in aggregate over all users, that would be awesome. Likewise if you can publish, clone and fork useful rules then modify them for one's account.  The less a user has to come up with their own rules, the better.<p>And there are things that IFTTT doesn't do for e-mail that this might do.  And there are API's that IFTTT doesn't support (the big one for me is springpad).<p>As for time sensitive, this could potentially learn what you respond to immediately upon viewing, and what you wait on or don't view, (and even analyze that as a function of day, time, sender, etc.)  If it had permissions to analyze e-mail texts and had enough users, it could use machine learning to learn what phrases were likely to prompt immediate action, IE ""By tomorrow morning"" vs. ""By Tuesday morning"" on a Wednesday.<p>As for non Oauth accounts, A browser plugin that stored your credentials locally could still be possible.  I seem to recall reading about somebody working on a clever way to do this involving passing session information using a proxy and encryption or something like that, but my memory isn't great.<p>All in all, I wish them luck.",1347187675

I raise this because when I first started programming, what really hammered the lessons in was actually trying to build a non-trivial application (which in my case was an invoicing app that I hoped a local business would buy).  Books and tutorials are useful to learn how independent simple pieces fit together but the lessons will not sink in until you actually try to use the concepts you learn to solve problems beyond textbook-like exercises.<p>Also, having a specific project in mind while learning will force you to actively think of ways how a certain concept/construct might be useful.

4495492,comment,4494629,4495104,5,0,tluyben2,,,"In my (limited, i'm only around 40 years on this planet) experience it's far from simple for people who don't want to know/learn. But I learned from my 94 year old grandfather who was not intelligent as in IQ but who knew how 'life' works and what is important and what not. People who know 'better' do usually (again, personal experience; it's easy to spot the sour people at a party) not achieve this happiness. It's quite easy for most people who just listen to older people.<p>The people who are truly not happy who I know personally almost all (2 exceptions) have a hangup about money; they want money to buy stuff. What stuff is unclear; once they get stuff (over the years), they usually don't do anything with it. Or if they do it didn't turn out the magic bullet they thought it was, which is of course the reason people don't buy it in the first place. It's like the 4 hour work week book; you can have your dream X TODAY but a lot of people will not do that because when they finally do their dream X it's very disappointing. And you didn't gain much happiness from it in the end.<p>The happiest people I know, who, I would say, scored a 10/10, are people who do not reason about their existence AND do what they like most all the time. My neighbor (who is a small goat herder) is 24/7 happy; I have only one creature who seems to have the same happiness and that's my little dog (<a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6134596/Screenshots/y835c9xw_lg~.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6134596/Screenshots/y835c9xw_lg~.png</a>). I don't think people who meta-live in any way can do a 10/10 or would they want to; I think a part of happiness is misery but I don't know exactly how that works yet. Might be my Calvanistic-ish upbringing though. People (I like to think i'm one of them) who do 9/10 on the scale, in my experience, do what they like and work <i>only</i> as their hobby, never for money(I know at least 2 people who rather live under a bridge than do something which is not their passion, and they both have in the past, but now they are doing well). I have no exceptions in my circles to this. Again; might be who I attract or not.<p>I think if you accept 'how it works' from people who actually are what you want to be (and no, that doesn't mean millionaires in my eyes as that's the biggest let down on earth if it takes you, as it usually does, a lot of time to achieve and it's really not very interesting; it's nice, but not for the reasons you might think and I don't have anything I wouldn't be able to 'do' which contribute to my happiness level).<p>Also, to me, not native EN speaker, enjoyment != happiness. Enjoyment, if you would want it 24/7, is a heroine drip. If you manage to make it so you cannot meta-live then maybe that means happiness as well (I never tried), but if you have 1 moment to contemplate, your happiness is gone.",1347187374

The thing I'd like to happen is for it to be an informed call. The stereotype I keep hitting about UX work is that:<p>* It's expensive<p>* It's more cost-effective to do it late than early<p>* It's just about making things ""pretty"" / ""easy to use""<p>When in reality the opposite is often true. For example doing user interviews and user testing early is stupidly cheap if done right. It stops you wasting money by building the wrong thing.<p><i>Please understand that when you think ""I won't work with him because he doesn't prioritize UX"".</i><p>I do not and would not think that.<p>I do think that people who don't prioritise UX often (not always) don't understand the value that UX work can bring - and think that all UX work done by bringing in high-paid agencies / consultants that do all the work up front.<p>I'd try and educate them with examples of how it can help save them money in the very short term.<p>For example - a few months back I was talking to founder who was planning to spend about 20k to develop an ""MVP"" for this social recommendation site he was planning. We talked through a way he could test his idea with his real users for the cost of negotiating a poster placement at a local gig (free to very low 100s of pounds), thinking up a hash tag (free) and looking at twitter during a certain period of time (free). A five minute conversation saved that guy between 15.5 & 20k that he's going to be able to spend in <i>useful</i> ways to further develop the concept.<p>Another guy I talked to was doing his ""get out the building stuff"" and getting out to talk to users. He was getting great feedback and was planning to build. Five minute chat about interview style and it came up that he was, unintentionally, directing the interviews towards the solution in his problem space. Gave him some tips on non-directive questions and getting users to tell stories. Got a call two weeks later to say thank you and a nice bottle of booze in the post because - when he went out again and talked to users - he discovered some new and <i>interesting</i> differences in what folk were saying that radically changed what he was going to build.<p>(Note to self: find ways to get paid for five minute conversations in coffee shops, although the whisky was nice :-)<p>To pick a personal example we've got an in-house project aimed at the health/weight-loss for folk who ""don't go to the gym"". Coz I'm rubbish at following my own advice (and was in the target group so thought I was  scratching my own itch) I started building our fantastic idea straight away - coz I had a couple of weeks free and, y'know, building shit is fun :-)<p>And yes - once we actually put it in front of users - nobody wanted it. We'd built the wrong thing. A couple of afternoons watching and listening and interviewing folk in that market told us what was wrong with the original idea, and has given us some great ideas for what we should be building instead (basically we were building something for folk with intrinsic motivation, we should have been building something for folk with extrinsic motivation). We wasted 14 days of work because I was too dumb to spend 1 day talking to people first.<p>I want UX skills understood and in the hands of everybody - because in my experience its the most effective way of building successful products cheaply.",1347186822

Clearly the jury did not execute their duties correctly in this case and it's been fascinating and quite surprising how openly and freely they have revealed their own willful ignorance.  But that ignorance is the product of three things: Samsung's failure to educate them, Apple's failure to educate them, and the judge's failure to instruct them well enough.  Samsung and Apple's failure's are clearly not going to be grounds for an appeal (""Your honor, we need an appeal because our lawyers are incompetent!"").  The only thing left is if Samsung could show that that Judge Koh did an unusually bad job in instructing the jury.

Other rules also require to have the window shades up so you can see what is happening overwing when taking off or landing, for example.<p>Having a phone on, or let's say, an iPod, won't disturb at all the electronic systems on board of the airplane. Maybe if you're flying a small airplane you'll have a phone doing weird stuff to your headset as someone said below (my personal experience is that it only happens when the phone starts transmitting with more power after you lose cell coverage). Or perhaps if it's a very old plane. But not a really big deal.<p>But when accidents do happen, you'd better be ready, and one of the reasons the FAA hasn't removed this rule yet, is that it forces most users to actually mind about what's happening (during t/o and landing) instead of being looking at their phones or listening to music. In case of an accident, or if an evacuation takes place, everything would happen in under two minutes and it is usually a good thing to have people see by themselves what's happening and ready to listen for instructions (and not disorientated).<p>Of course your plane won't crash if you're playing Angry Birds during landing. It's just not a good idea to do it.",1347186008

It is entirely possible to choose some subset for which you know how to decide the halting problem, and program within the that subset.<p>No. Think about what you're saying. To be able to choose from among useful, nontrivial programs, those to whom the unsolved Turing halting problem doesn't apply, is to solve the Turing halting problem.<p>> It is a matter of cleverness (rather, successful algorithm design and theorem proving) how large you can make that subset.<p>This is a first-class logical error. Choosing the subset as you suggest, is equivalent to solving the Turing Halting problem, yet the problem is known to be insoluble. Surely you see this.<p>> This subset, this language, will necessarily exclude universal Turing Machines and other forms of interpreters  but I see no particular reason this is a problem for writing power plant control systems.<p>There is no other way to say this -- you are mistaken, in the most basic way. The Turing halting problem is not the common cold, that you can wait out, nor is it a question of language design, that you can finesse. It is fundamental, and the original claim -- approximately ""prove to be failsafe"" -- is not possible for any program more complex than ""Hello World"".<p>If you want a failsafe program to regulate your drilling operation or nuclear power plant, yes, you can have it, but all it can do is print ""Hello World"" over and over again.<p>If instead you want a useful program, one that can actually do useful work, you must accept that the Turing halting problem is (a) unsolved, and (b) insoluble.<p>> It is a matter of cleverness ...<p>It is not a matter of cleverness.

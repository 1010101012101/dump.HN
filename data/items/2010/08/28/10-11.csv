1641587,comment,1639028,1639313,0,0,geden,,,"I'm surprised you don't see the humour in a 'pico dollar'.<p>I thought - this guy has DJB sized balls, I really want to use it. portsnap was great, this will be too.<p>And I don't even have a beard.<p>Colin has a platinum backed BSD pedigree. Tarsnap appears to be aiming at BSD minded users in the first instance ie people who mostly know what they are doing. Colin's grown tarsnap out of what he knows, the BSD aesthetic.  What you know is a really good place to start.<p>But now, to grow tarnap beyond the BSD commandline pico-niche, something I really hope Colin does, because he's earned the success, it could / should adopt a Jungledisk like model. With an OS X desktop client, clearer pricing, and Apple level UX/marketing. And clients for home storage devices like Qnaps etc. And yes he should charge much more for that. Tarsnap does seem bizarrely, wonderfully cheap. And long may it remain that way... on the commandline.",1282993055

I thought exactly the opposite.<p>The problem of Google to me seems to be that they release something they think it's good enough and then just leave it there hoping that time will prove them right. Then one day they wake up and see there has not been any adoption, and kill it.<p>When Google releases something they are hardly all behind it, and seem to forget about it in a week.",1282993038

More importantly you need to understand programmatic problem solution concepts, work-flow and maintainability.<p>Creating GUI's with gui editors is already there for most frameworks, but it does not make programming easier, it merrily reduces UI design effort for very simple applications (and increases hassle for more elaborate widget interactions).<p>As a computer programmer your biggest challenge is to understand the problem and apply your experience about problem solution logic to it via a programming language, than slap a UI on to it.",1282992162

Once I learned some actual physics, I realized none of that discussion made any sense at all.<p>Something isn't intellectual discovery just because information is exchanged and both people feel they are learning stuff. Intellectual discovery makes sense if you are trying to structure the knowledge and are connecting it to knowledge you already have. Without things to connect it to, such as a shared definition of 'theory', you end up running around in circles.<p>It's like being dropped into a maze and not trying to solve it, but just running around in it. It may be fun, and you won't hear me complain, but as soon as someone starts wondering whether they are going too much into the details of solving it (""maybe I'm splitting hairs""), I feel obliged to point out they haven't really started to solve it. They've just been randomly discovering the territory, not noticing whether they returned to the same point several times.<p>I'm not trying to be disparaging; I'm just pointing out that talk of 'splitting hairs' is really premature.",1282991228

More profitable, too.<p>It's in your best interest to promote the 'heroic' model of startups, that don't charge but grow huge and sell -- a hopeful one-time sale model -- rather than incremental sales like I do.<p>If the top of the mountain is earning a lot of money from your business, there are still different ways to reach that peak. Every mountain has multiple faces.<p>Some faces are easy and well-known, like creating a product that creates business value, and then capturing that value by charging. Other faces are considered ""ballsy"" because they are so difficult -- the model of growing big while free, and then the one-time liquidity event.<p>The easy face can still get you to the top, and, bonus - it's easy!",1282990935

1641557,comment,1634471,1634564,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"> Personally, I think we should not personify our computing hardware. It's a tool, not your friend.<p>Humans personify everything they interact with -- including simple hand tools. We like one better than the other; it feels like it has a personality. Of course, we know, intellectually, that it doesn't, but that doesn't matter.<p>We're hardwired for judging and feeling personalities. And faces. That's why car look like they have ""faces"" on the front and why people have historically referred to vehicles like ships, boats, and cars as if they are (at least) simple beasts rather than just things.<p>Computers are by far the most complex tool the typical person uses, and we treat interaction with a computer much like we treat interaction with a person from a psychological perspective. That's why it's so infuriating when a computer fails to respond to input -- it's the same mechanism that gets triggered when you're talking to a person who looks at you but doesn't acknowledge you in any way.<p>Apple isn't trying to make the computer your friend, it's honoring the implicit personification you're doing anyway.",1282990686

1641555,comment,1641217,1641549,0,0,pcowans,,,"I'd agree with this. Pick something you already use and fix or extend it in ways which make a meaningful difference to you, but be aware of and respect the design goals of the original authors.<p>In practical terms, you can just start hacking on the code yourself which will normally be available from a version control system somewhere, but when you've made changes you'll need to submit patches for consideration to the project maintainers at first. If you're unsure what format to use, just email to ask. For projects hosted on github you can just fork the project there which will make it technically easier to get patches back into the main branch. As you build up trust with others involved in the project you'll be able to get commit access to the project repository and make changes yourself.<p>As for IDEs etc, each project will have conventions and project metadata (makefiles, project indices etc.) suitable for a specific setup, so figure this out when you've picked a project and work with what's already in place as much as possible.<p>[edit] One other thing: it will be <i>really</i> hard to get started - getting up to speed with how a new piece of software works is difficult at the best of times and most projects aren't designed to make this easy. Persevere, as once you've got to grips with layout and conventions and got to know the other contributors things will become much easier.",1282990651

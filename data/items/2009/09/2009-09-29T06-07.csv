I really appreciate them.<p>I wanted to do this project from scratch (instead of using WordPress or Drupal), because I felt that down the line, it would be easier to add features which might not align well with an existing CMS type of system. Right now this website is implemented in Django and Python.<p>Another motivation was, it would help me learn some design skills.<p>I agree that while re setting everything to WordPress will give the website a much more professional look, I would still like to do it myself, if only for the learning experience.",1254207563

849948,comment,849409,849409,0,0,natch,,,"Is there a good anti-iPhone rant somewhere that avoids logical fallacies and would help me understand why some people are averse to iPhone development? I don't get it.<p>Central point of control == bad?<p>I don't buy it. JWZ is a central point of control for DNA Lounge, I assume; PG is a close to a central point of control for YC news; Linus is a central point of control for Linux kernel enhancements -- or was, for a while; I haven't been keeping up so if I'm wrong, please understand the general point, which is: we happily accept central control as long as there is good will.<p>DRM == bad?<p>Again, though I agree, Apple's implementation of DRM for Apps has gotten it far closer to right than any other, with family sharing of one purchase on multiple devices, refunds, DRM-free music, free updates, remembering your purchase so you can re-download purchased items for free (remember the phone companies' model, buy a game, run out of memory, delete it, then if you want it later you have to buy it again?). Definitely iPhone is not free, in the freedom sense, and downright scary, in the your-app-can-be-yanked-at-any-time sense, but I believe the same is true on Android; we just haven't seen the test case yet.<p>iPhone is not open == bad<p>OK... but it's a platform. Lots of platforms are open only down to certain layers. Google is a platform. But it only exposes certain parts of itself for developers to use. And we understand that. So why do we not understand it when it comes to a phone? Maybe because it's such a personal device?<p>It doesn't let us do everything == bad<p>I think this comes closest to being an answer. This would be the answer for me. But, neither does any other device. I continue to think that Android developers are naive to assume they are not going to bump up against limits imposed by carriers and by Google. They just don't have the critical mass to have hit all the nooks and crannies yet.<p>Apple is not friendly to open source == bad.<p>Grand Central Dispatch, LLVM, Clang (probably there are more) all would indicate otherwise.<p>So, what am I missing? Not trying to troll here. I'm sure I have exhibited some ignorance in this long post, seriously. Why are (some small number of smart) people pounding their heads against the wall rather than develop for iPhone?",1254206833

Perhaps my example was not a good one. However, three or four additional sets of classes, has increased my own productivity, especially during development. I keep a partial CSS file with 5, 6 generic sets. Most large newspaper sites use this method. It all depends in what one needs to do. In this method the style sheet is 'more abstracted', it does not know about a box.cold. If you skinning a wordpress template, you better off to offer the box.cold in the stylesheet, but then you must provide a second style sheet to offer the box.hot! This method also allows a bit of presentational flexibility for new page designs, without playing with the main CSS files or adding another CSS file. Somewhere, along the line there is a golden line I guess.",1254206137

Its primary point, that ""type"" doesn't mean the same thing in ""statically typed"" and ""dynamically typed"", is well put. The model he presents of static typing taking a proof-based approach to correctness while dynamic typing takes a test-based approach is also interesting.<p>It's quite wrong, though, to say that the modern unit testing school (i.e. xUnit and TDD) is a creature of the dynamically typed world. It is very much a creature of the Java world. It's true that the original xUnit was Smalltalk's, but that was a pale foreshadowing of Junit. And all the examples from Beck's TDD book were in Java. The most zealous unit-testers may be Rubyists, but their numbers are surely dwarfed by the number of people programming in that style in Java and .NET. I did so in C# for years myself.<p>Edit: he also is far too dismissive of the importance of performance.

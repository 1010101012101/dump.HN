4727819,comment,4727548,4727548,1,0,pc86,,,"A few points:<p>You're not charging nearly enough. If you're good enough to build a startup's MVP there's no reason for you to charge less than $80-100/hr. It doesn't matter where you live, either; code written in New York City works the same way as code written in Omaha.<p>I'm going to second the general consensus and say that no, you shouldn't, unless you're getting something else out of it with a potential upside above your current rate. If you're going to risk getting paid nothing more than a fraction of your already low rate, the upside needs to compensate for that.<p>Personally, I don't think you should take equity. Too many startups fail and even for successful startups equity generally means squat unless you're raising a ton and can take some off the table, or you're profitable and can get a disbursement.<p>If I were in your position, I'd agree to the $2k flat rate, capped at <i>n</i> hours (100?). If it goes over, $20/hr thereafter. Ask for a royalty off the top of every subscription/widget/sale, something like the lesser/greater of <i>$x</i> or <i>y%</i> depending on their model. Instead of someone skimming profits that will most likely never materialize, you're a cost of doing business <i>before</i> they become profitable.<p>Asking for equity guarantees you a slice of what will most likely be nothing. Asking for a royalty gets you a small sum with every sale. And you've still got the $2k.",1351781773

4727729,comment,4726876,4726999,10,0,simba-hiiipower,,,"id say the big differentiator here is the software. iOS isnt optimized for keyboard input (and, as far as i know, doesnt support mouse input at all). Windows RT however, being essentially the same as Windows 8 in this regard, is efficiently navigable via keyboard and mouse input alone. so beyond having the physical keyboard there to replace the on-screen one for typing-out long messages, it also serves as an effective navigation tool and with all the traditional Windows shortcuts available. the Surface covers also include dedicated media keys and have function keys assigned to the newly introduced <i>charms</i> as well as full trackpads.<p>an iPad with a physical keyboard tacked-on actually degrades ease of use as the addition changes the form of the device while not providing an alternative means of interacting with it suitable to that form. as a result, beyond the single action of typing, all navigation becomes less efficient as you have to reach-out and touch the screen in a less-natural way than accustomed to. i've found that even the typing experience here doesnt feel that much better as you still get interrupted when having to make what would be otherwise minor adjustments (moving cursor, selecting text, formatting, ...) by having to reach-out to the screen.<p>on a Surface though, the cover provides a complete and efficient alternative means of input. this has less to do with the particular implementation of the cover/kickstand (which is great by the way) but rather, that it runs essentially the same OS as the majority of (non-touch-enabled) desktops and laptops to be sold in the coming years. regardless of particular views on Windows 8 and whether it is less efficient than previous versions, it still is a fully functional traditional OS, and interacting with it as such works very well.<p>using a Surface for a few days now, i really do think the <i>form factor</i> lives-up to the claim of <i>no-compromises</i>. you can navigate entirely via touch or entirely through the traditional mouse/keyboard combo and not even know that the other existed. and (the most likely option) somewhere in-between works exceptionally well. while i traditionally use the cover while in the desktop or typing-out a long message (like now), i find the input method option it affords is also great to have for when i just happen to be sitting at a desk or want to use the device standing-up on my lap. in that sense the particular implementation on the Surfaces cover/kickstand really shine as it makes switching between form factors effortless.",1351780757

His customers likely are all using a different currency locally, and would have to exchange that currency for bitcoins.<p>For example:<p>Let's say a month of service costs 3 bitcoins, and currently a bitcoins cost 8 rupees (24 rupees/month for service). What happens when the price of the bitcoin rises to 20 rupees / bitcoin? Does the price (in bitcoins) drop? What happens if this significant rise only happens in one market, but not another? What if one 50% of his customer-base experience significant exchange increases, but the other 50% doesn't?<p>It's a curious thing, because almost no one is being paid (salary/wages) in bitcoins, so they <i>all</i> need to exchange the local currency to pay for service.<p><pre><code>  > Plus I do not think that Kim will want to\n  > have anything to do with that currency.\n</code></pre>\nI was using the USD as an example.

4727646,comment,4726876,4727131,2,0,gregsq,,,"I agree very much on this. There are some precision tasks that I do, such as audio waveform editing, circuit boards, photoshop image masking and so on that can't be done efficiently without a pointing device, or a surrogate. When using the MBP I use an MX performance mouse with the MBP to get some control over some of these processes. The trackpad, while useful for some tasks, simply isn't accurate enough.<p>I do hear many comments claiming that touchscreens can supersede mice, and even keyboards, but I don't think this is right at all. The form factor of a mouse can be made to very closely align ergonomically with the time proven accuracy of the artisans dexterous hand. Angular displacement at the wrist traverses a relatively larger sweeping arc than with a track pad, effectively increasing resolution at something like the square of the distance. Wacom styluses are also precision devices, and yet I would still suggest that they aren't as conformant with watch maker like skills as the ordinary extended hand.<p>Compared with high resolution devices, big finger tips and small area track pads are clumsy and add difficulty. I wouldn't want to design fine watch mechanisms with either.<p>It's essentially an issue of resolution over area. I can reduce the resolution of a trackpad to attain some accuracy, but in doing so reduce the effective area.<p>In respect of how to have both accuracy and the simplicity of touch, I'm inclined to think that making a gesture and moving the hand backwards through the z plane to regain resolution space would be one approach. We already have protected virtual keyboards. I would be happy with moving into a projected motion detection area to regain accuracy. Until then, I have no option but to use a high resolution location device, like a mouse.",1351779813

It might then offer these people a 20% discount on their next shopping trip at its stores.<p>Cardlytics would insert an advertisement to this effect into these customers online-bank statements, ideally under a relevant transaction such as a payment to a rival retailer.

The sensors would be located in spaces, e.g. a room.  Individuals would carry corresponding bracelet, widget, whatever.  Ideally the sensors should be battery powered so as to minimize the prototype infrastructure e.g. wiring, etc.<p>The goal of prototype is functional demonstration, so an initial plain (and possibly not so pretty) device is OK, but of course would be great if you can also recommend casing solutions.<p>I would appreciate any feedback and leads on resources such as vendors, etc.<p>Thank you, HN!",1351779454

According to the law you can be incarcerated for at least 60 days, just on a complain. In other words you can be arrested just because a women complains, even if no evidence is found, or they don't even have to ask for evidence. The presumption of guilt prevails. You are presumed to be a offender. This law has been often used for near extortion scenarios. It works like this, since it covers the women of the husbands family. Often younger sister of the husband is arrested or his mother is arrested. He will be called to police station to part away his with his property, and generally the arrests are made on Friday's so that these people can stay in jail over the weekend until a bail application can be filed on Monday.<p>Women are heavily abusing this law for money. Its like marry a guy, slap a 498a case. Get his family members behind bars(Often happens after bribing the policemen). In India its highly devastating to a persons morale, self respect and social status for him to go to jail or see female members of the family go to jail. Then what follows is a black mail and guy is forced to pay up.<p>The law has been abused by the police and some women so much.

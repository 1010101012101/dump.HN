4984404,comment,4981743,4982158,1,0,corporalagumbo,,,"The capitalist system is continually evolving and eliminating inefficiencies which allow people to profit from harming others. The trend has been strongly towards better controls to prevent businesses from externalising costs to the detriment of society, these controls have in turned spurred innovation which has resulted in cleaner, better, more productive technology benefitting everyone. Just like going around beating people up and stealing their wallets is no longer a viable road to financial success, businesses can no longer expect to profit from dumping harmful chemicals into waterways. The range of options for profit are continually being tightened and focussed exclusively in the realm of mutual benefit.<p>We are, hopefully, on the verge of sensible legislation to prevent businesses and individuals externalising the costs of greenhouse gases too, and so spur healthy innovation in that most important area, and in so doing securing the future habitability of the planet - hopefully once we do so your objections to capitalism will begin to fade.",1356836324

4984341,comment,4982850,4983219,3,0,corporalagumbo,,,"I think he's right to question the viability of the brand. Facebook has accumulated a pretty incredible amount of unflattering connotations over time, and is now probably one of the least cool tech companies around, at least in the eyes of normal people. Personally I find it telling that the people I respect the most are those that publicly post on Facebook the least (naturally I use it post publicly never :) )<p>The danger here is that once a company gets uncool, they often get desperate to try and prove that they're cool again. For an example of how well that tends to work out, see Microsoft's increasingly-shrill efforts to prove that they're still hip. The problem as far as I see it stems from the fact that the best companies project an image of selflessness - they're not actually trying to make money, they're just people who have a really, really amazing product, that they love so much, and are so happy introducing to the world. Once a company gets uncool and desperate, and starts casting around trying to reinvent themselves, they are basically openly admitting that their only purpose is to make money and their only desire is to beat their competition. This is Microsoft's position right now, and it's not tenable in the long-term in my opinion. People just don't like desperation and the dishonest posturing it breeds. Facebook could walk right into that same trap (not helped by the fact that Mark Zuckerberg is so uncool.)",1356834997

Enjoy sitting on your own while everyone else has fun - enjoy never getting invited to the river again - enjoy sitting at home playing videogames as the braver boys wander off with into the grass with all the cute girls.<p>Teenage impulsivity and risk-tasking are reproductively optimal strategies (the actual rates of death and disability from these activities are usually low anyway) even if you like to look down your nose at them. And people who engage in those activities often end up doing just fine in later life, as well-adjusted, popular, confident adults, with a history of sexual success.<p>Maybe they're not optimal strategies for being a high-performing time-efficient adult, but so what?

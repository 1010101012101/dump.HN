Why should it be a problem for software? We have technologies for making software citable with a DOI, so we could aim for the same network-of-references approach to discoverability that has worked reasonably well for journal articles.<p>As for impact metrics, they have done more harm than good for papers, so I don&#x27;t see why should run to make the same mistake for software. Moreover, we could do much better. Given that we are slowly moving towards provenance tracking and workflow management for replicability, we could use that same provenance information for measuring software use in a way that is verifiable and hard to game. I have outlined such an approach in a recent paper (<a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.5773.3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.5773.3</a>, see the Conclusions), which should be combined with transitive credit (<a href=""http://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/jors.be/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/jor...</a>).

It was an intentionally extreme example to highlight the concept of proportionality.<p>And seriously, you chide me for playing funny buggers with numbers, then characterise a list of 11 things as &#x27;many, many&#x27;? Not to mention that you&#x27;re implying that the rest of the items are frequently encountered - how many people <i>actually</i> run into no-fly list problems, or have been corralled into a free speech zone?<p>Finally, I couldn&#x27;t give a fuck about the Americanness of the victims. I&#x27;m not American myself. I think it&#x27;s a stain on the general American character that so often in discussion about human rights, that whether or not a victim is a US citizen is a salient issue. Why is it less of a moral crime for an unaccountable court to decide to kill a foreigner they don&#x27;t like? Why is it less of a crime for a tourist to be put on a no-fly list or have their speech curtailed?<p>You completely misread me if you think I&#x27;m of the opinion that the US doesn&#x27;t have problems. It has serious problems, and a double-helping of them. It also has a lot of awesome aspects. Authoritarianism is on the rise, but the US as it currently stands is not a police state. There is so much hyperbole in US political discourse; everything is polarised and taken to extremes. Someone is a democrat|republican? Now we know everything there is to know about that individual, and they clearly support everything that one party (of only two) does!<p>The comment I&#x27;m arguing against is a typical sky-is-falling polarised position, and doesn&#x27;t have the shades of gray that the real world does. In police states, people have their movement limited, are afraid to speak out against the government (hardly the case in the US) for fear of prison or similar, and are even afraid of talking to their neighbours due to widespread citizen informant networks. The US is a long way from that - but again, you don&#x27;t have to be a police state in order to have problems.",1445420494

10424362,comment,10420241,10422991,0,0,klibertp,,,"> It really does hurt some excellent languages (e.g. OCaml) that they look so alien to mainstream, working programmers.<p>How will you explain a relative success of F#, then?<p>In my opinion &quot;looking alien&quot; is not important at all. To the mainstream real qualities are much less important than marketing; that&#x27;s true in many areas and mainstream programming is not an exception. Given enough marketing, you can turn &quot;alien syntax&quot; into a perceived advantage relatively easily.<p>> To mention OCaml again, I find it ridiculously hard to read because there are tiny, similar-looking characters that are significant all over the place.<p>Have you seen J? I&#x27;ll just paste a bit of code in it:<p><pre><code>   join =: 1 : 0\n    ((([:{.[:>{.),:[:([:<(>&quot;0))&quot;1[:{:[:1 2 0&|:[:>([:,u&quot;0)#]) (pr y))\n   )\n</code></pre>\nIs it readable? I&#x27;m told that yes, it is. There are people who can read this mess just fine, no problems at all.<p>Readability is an artifact of familiarity and, in some cases, tooling. You can get used to reading (and writing) even the most &quot;unreadable&quot; of syntaxes. Ask a PERL programmer if she finds her language readable. Will she say &quot;no&quot;?<p>My point is: until readability is formally defined and we&#x27;re able to measure it objectively it&#x27;s utterly useless to talk about it.<p>> But it is Haskell&#x27;s problem if it can&#x27;t overcome the catch-22 that people don&#x27;t use a language if other people don&#x27;t use it.<p>Yes, but this problem <i>cannot</i> be solved with technical qualities alone. Was it possible we wouldn&#x27;t use C, Java or JavaScript at all.<p>It&#x27;s marketing and &quot;killer use-cases&quot; that matter. You want to use the same language your OS is written in, for example. Was Windows written in OCaml you&#x27;d use OCaml to write Windows programs. If there&#x27;s a program you really like, which is scriptable in Lua, you will use Lua.",1445418617

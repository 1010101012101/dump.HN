208275,comment,207948,207948,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"I have lived this lifestyle, it is ok, with some caveats.<p>If you do extended travel, learn how to be outgoing. My first long trip was to Japan. Being shy and quiet made the first 3 months a nightmare. Luckily, at the time I was young and still reasonably good looking so women would ask me out. But it would have been more fun and easier if I hadn't had such social anxiety. I did some extreme personality modification afterwards and when I went other places I had a much better time.<p>It is very important to nail #1, figure out a career that you love, or at least LIKE. It isn't as though you come back, return to work, and your work anxiety is alleviated by your fond travel memories. In fact, your travel experience makes it much worse because you are just thinking ""fuck I could be on the beach in Thailand right now instead of rebooting these servers at 4 in the morning.""<p>Safety net is sort of important. You don't want to return and then be stuck taking the first job that comes along. Note that safety net doesn't necessarily mean having a bunch of cash. It could mean having a friend or family with an extra room where you can stay in the area where you want to work. In my case it sucked, because most of my friends were bums like me who live in studio apartments, and most of my family lives in the extreme middle of nowhere. Trying to find a job in Palo Alto while you are in the Yukon is not easy or fun.<p>Also, figure out what you really want. Travel is easy. You just need money for a plane ticket. You can go almost anytime. I didn't realize until after I traveled that what I really wanted was financial and career independence. I probably missed out on 5 prime career building years by bumming around doing the travel/slacker thing. Now I have to compete with Google Ycombinator braniacs. Back in the day, I only would have had to be as smart as the guys who made BlueMountain.com or geocities...",1212522950

208216,comment,207948,207948,0,0,notdarkyet,,,"Well, being 22 I must say that a few of these I had realized a long time ago.  The theme of this post seems to be that living somewhat of a nomadic lifestyle and traveling is what we should all be doing.  Similar to how drug users and people who don't have 100% faith in what they are doing attempt to bring people in with them, this author is trying to convince us all to be free wielding travelers in a time when we have no commitments.  Sort of a validation by mass usage.  Not all of us have an extra $1000 lying around to just leave everything on a whim (and some simply do not want to).  While I would like to travel someday, it is simply not in the cards now.<p>One most important things that I have taken notice to in the past few years or so is that your life path is exactly what you want to make it.  Early on in the school systems we are led to believe that your life will go as follows: School => Find High Salary Job => Retirement => Death. They train you to become reliant on the system and think that your goal should be to exit schooling with a high paying salary and if you don't you are screwed.  You will be miserable and lonely forever.  They never suggest once that you can stray off that path and most never question it.<p>Another realization that I have come across lately is that it is easy to become caught up in idealism.  It's nice to dream up what you see for your future and forget where you are now.  Steve Jobs spoke in his 05 Stanford commencement speech of connecting the dot's in hindsight and not realizing the impact that some previous events had at the time.  The important thing to realize is not that we should look back in hindsight and connect the dots rather, focus on the creation of the dots themselves.  You are in control and your future is not some mystical set-in-stone experience that you will have a great epiphany over sometime in the future while reflecting.  So rather than hope that everything will work itself out, find out what you want and be the one to create the dots, not connect them. I could go on more but it's time I go create  my reality rather than ramble about potentials.",1212520117

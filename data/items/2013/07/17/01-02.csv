Now, I talk to them once every couple of months (and we might hang out a few times a year).<p>Is this normal? My friends and I don&#x27;t have much in common anymore. While I&#x27;m not depressed, I miss having meaningful conversations with people.<p>How do adults deal with this? Apart from a significant other, do people usually have a few close friends that they can talk to about important things? I&#x27;m otherwise in a decent place mentally, but everyday interactions tend to be shallow and it gets lonely. Thanks for any perspective or advice.",1374026382

It&#x27;s mixing and routing capabilities are fairly easy to use in simple cases, but it&#x27;s more difficult to create complex setups than in Logic.<p>Where Ableton really excels (other than for live performance) is in productivity of compositing and production when working entirely within the application.

6055742,comment,6054935,6055686,3,0,rayiner,,,"&quot;Unfair competition&quot; is a blanket term for various civil torts: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfair_competition#Commercial_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfair_competition#Commercial_l...</a>. It include things like spreading false information about a product or price fixing. I think copying technology could be fit into tort framework instead of a property framework as with patents. Instead of filing a suit saying: &quot;I own this patent and he infringed,&quot; you&#x27;d have to file a suit along the lines of &quot;he gained an unfair advantage by copying technology I spent a lot of time and money developing.&quot;<p>One of the nice things about torts is that they are very flexible. Common law judges have a lot of flexibility to look at actual controversies and tweek the rules to get the &quot;right&quot; results. Judges don&#x27;t have any of this flexibility under the existing patent regime. The Patent Act says that basically anything is patentable, so judges have to follow the intent of Congress. Some important backstops against patentability, e.g. the exclusion of algorithms and laws of nature, are judicially-created, and moving patent law to a tort framework would give courts more leeway to create these sorts of exceptions in response to practical concerns.",1374026127

The whole operation took less than two minutes, then the two trespassers fled the way they came, leaving no trace that they had ever been there.<p>It did not take long for the official to determine that the two men were, in fact, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operatives conducting what is known in the U.S. intelligence community as either a &quot;black bag job&quot; or a &quot;surreptitious entry&quot; operation.&quot;<p>I wonder how sophisticated that operation was (and how sophisticated today&#x27;s equivalent is).<p>Would _you_ know if someone had loaded some new software onto your laptop? How would you protect against that? I wonder if running Tripwire on my OS X and Linux laptops as well as on servers might be smart?

And I get 1 full day of sick leave per month that gets accrued too. It&#x27;s fairly gravy.<p>I make iOS apps, and contribute to fairly large state-wide systems.

One of those mechanisms is the almost unlimited power of common law courts to compel people to furnish information, through subpoenas and warrants. And that power is especially strong when the information is about <i>someone else</i>. So for example, while a court cannot force you to testify against yourself (5th amendment), they can force you to testify against someone else. They can force you to furnish information or copies of documents relevant to an investigation or ongoing litigation. Indeed, in a civil litigation, often one of the lawyers will be able to issue subpoenas forcing parties to turn over documents in the name of the court. In the Anglo-American system, there is really no &quot;right of privacy&quot; as against the right of a court to gather all the evidence necessary in a civil or criminal litigation.<p>So corporations <i>do</i> have 4th amendment rights. The NSA doesn&#x27;t come to their offices and take the information. But that doesn&#x27;t protect them against court orders to furnish information about other people.",1374024082

6055617,comment,6054268,6054268,25,0,NamTaf,,,"Speaking from a non-IT standpoint (mech engineer, rail industry), BigCo offers a number of cool benefits that I&#x27;d not get working for SmallCo (that may or may not hold analogous to the IT sector in some cases):<p>- Economies of scale #1: when you&#x27;re purchasing 10,000 instances of something, people listen and new techniques of doing things become available.<p>- Economies of scale #2: Design changes when milking an extra $100 out of the design or manufacturing process means saving $1m at 10,000 instances. You get exposure to new design/manufacturing techniques as a result.<p>- Project diversity: I could find 20 projects in this office of 150 engineers, all significantly different. They range across design, asset management, PM work, maintenance/reliability, acquisition, etc. Each applies to a number of different targets - fixed plant, mobile assets, facilities, etc. If I grow bored of something I can reasonably rotate to something new and different within 6 months. More long-term, there&#x27;s opportunities in multiple countries if I so wish to pursue them.<p>- Institutional knowledge: I can walk in to our drawing room and still find drawings dated from 1870. Some of the greybeards here seem almost as old, and come with a huge amount of knowledge (both specific and simply general &#x27;tricks of the trade&#x27;) that isn&#x27;t recorded anywhere.<p>There&#x27;s also downsides:<p>- Work sometimes feels like it&#x27;s a game of thrones. The fiefdoms can grow tiring.<p>- Stuff happens slowly. BigCos carry inertia that can be cumbersome. Counterpoint: inertia can produce some amazing results if you get everyone paddling in the same direction<p>- Career advancement usually requires jumping ship to different companies. Said greybeards are in it for the long haul and unless a new position opens up, you&#x27;re generally stuck below the glass ceiling.",1374023154

Even if that can be formally excluded (which is unlikely), the next most likely reason (alluded to in the article) is that dementia is one aspect of ageing, and that if people are healthier for longer then the effects of ageing are less pronounced in the younger elderly.  Thus it would have no impact on the eventual likelihood of dementia for an individual, just that it might occur later than it otherwise would.",1374023011

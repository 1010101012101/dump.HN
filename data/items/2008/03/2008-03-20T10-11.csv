Pretty cool idea, filling up empty seats on charter planes by advertising them over the internet (if I remember correctly). That way you never have an empty jet flying back to its home base.<p>Of course, what everybody wants to know is if they work for Virgin Charter, will they get free rides from Virgin Galactic?",1206010756

141563,comment,141516,141516,0,0,getp,,,"I agree very much on the filtering aspect of the stream. For instance, I have a problem with my RSS feeds: there's just too many of them and it takes a long time to check them all. Of course, you could go all Zenhabits here, but in the end, people are lazy. If you can somehow rank/filter the incoming info, you're on to something. Unfortunately, that's also the hard part, because just filtering by keywords (like feedrinser) is a quite crude solution, and you could easily miss out on interesting stuff.",1206010208

So with that Caveat:<p>I think this team has like so many before them got the idea that solving Brook's accidental complexity in selected domains leads towards solving the problem of essential complexity.<p>Anyone who did not live through the era of ""fourth level languages"" will not have been inoculated against this error. It seems to me that you can always simplify the programming task in specific domains (often with a DSL) but I have yet to have even got a hint of a solution to the problems of applying such approaches to a wider business process.",1206009144

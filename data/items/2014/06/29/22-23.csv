Systems continued to be optimized best for workloads that looked like scientific computing in Fortran from the 80&#x27;s or desktop applications written in C++ from the 90&#x27;s. Hardware architectures to support video games and media, on the other hand, seem to have taken huge strides over the same timeframe. Now, it seems like they are behind in terms of supporting distributed systems on multi-core machines. The kind of contortions required to detect and avoid problems like False Sharing indicate that today&#x27;s hardware could be a good ways suboptimal for building these systems.",1404082782

Letting staff do their own thing maybe just a symptom of starting out as a few people and not having migrated into the processes of a bigger company yet.<p>If the majority of employees are developers, their set-up is extremely personal and no doubt having them customise to their liking aids productivity.

This is not a point in their favor.<p>Perhaps not, but it&#x27;s glorious compared to, say, .xcodeproj.<p>Combined with .props files (same format as .csproj), managing .vcxproj s (also the same format as .csproj), to manage a build matrix of ~5 platforms x ~7 build configurations x ~20 projects via a few hundred .props files hasn&#x27;t been that bad.<p>> XML is an extremely verbose syntax to have to deal with.<p>Easy to parse, though, if you want to automate keeping it in sync with other formats.<p>>  As long as you stay in VS you won&#x27;t really notice. As soon as you leave though its no longer comfortable.<p>The longer I use them the more often I drop down to simply firing up a text editor to edit my .props files.  Configuring through the IDE is a great way to add a whole bunch of state which you may or may not have meant to set, and can get quite unwieldy... whereas I can see everything at a glance that a single .props file configures by simply opening it up.<p>At this point I have our .vcxproj file lists almost entirely decoupled from the .props build settings.  Fewer merges, and each .props file is quite easy to digest at a glance.",1404082561

But it&#x27;s hackish (relies on some pretty complex macros) and requires you to adapt certain conventions. Still, it&#x27;s doable and a whole lot safer than managing your memory directly in terms of leaks and re-use after free. The cost to me really is that macro magic, that should not be required but it&#x27;s the only thing I could think of to make this work.

7962795,comment,7961948,7962650,5,0,DenisM,,,"1. c# is a great language - LINQ and type inference make it as succint as python (or even more when I use extensions methods and generics!), static type system gives a lot of safety eliminating huge classes of bugs, decent performance compared to other succint languages like Python or ruby. Really hits the spot for me, and I would hate to go to a dynamically typed language now.<p>2. VS is a great IDE if you give it enough RAM.<p>3. LINQ2SQL makes for quite pleasurable, succint and type-safe database manipulation. Bulk updates suck though, but that&#x27;s an ORM for you. SQL is also a good database, and when time is right I can make use of remote database mirroring, instantly boosting my fault-tolerance. I could use Postgres as well, but SQL tips the scales with LINQ2SQL.<p>4. Reasonably popular, compared to web dev in other succint statically typed languages say, Haskell. So I can find answers on stack overflow.<p>5. Nuget. Sometimes I need a commercial package, and I can often times just get it from Nuget, play with it, and then punch in serial number after paying to remove watermarks etc. It&#x27;s nice to have those packages for when I need them, to be able to buy my way out of problems.<p>6. Backward compatibility. I heard that ruby was breaking it more than once and python did it once. .NET seems to be less prone to this.<p>And I really see no downsides to it. Windows is only 20% more expensive on AWS, and hosting is literally the last on my list of expenses. Performance is good enough for me - given my business model I will be able to afford a small data center before my single Windows server gets too small for my workload.

The key here, and what you so defensively fail to realize, is that it&#x27;s completely possible to figure out what&#x27;s a technically decent <i>game</i> independent of one&#x27;s own tastes and the majority of commercial RPG Maker releases--Aveyond very, very much included--are <i>bad</i>.<p>Seriously, go play the field. I have, because I&#x27;m making a JRPG, and I find the field lame as hell. Bad UX (how many menus must you click through to do anything? WHY?), mediocre assets (<i>lots</i> of art is expensive, but <i>good</i> art is manageable), and gameplay that is hindered by--wait for it--<i>being in RPG Maker</i>. RPG Maker in all its incarnations has limited ways to interact with the core mechanics. You can&#x27;t rip out the worst parts of it. You can&#x27;t <i>fix</i> it (and this is why the good ones, like To the Moon and Always Sometimes Monsters, treat it as a walk-around visual novel instead of an RPG engine). The ability to avoid these limitations is why EasyRPG may have a chance, but I tend to think the overwhelming sameyness of titles using a limited engine will keep them at very-niche status.<p>And female game developers are honestly not that rare anymore if you pay attention to the indie scene.

Almost anything that can crash a process on a server -- either literally at OS level or figuratively by requiring something to reset itself before it can continue to do its job -- is probably a DoS attack waiting to happen. That might or might not be as dangerous as something like a remote root vulnerability, but I would argue that it is a serious security issue just the same.<p>(I&#x27;m sure it also goes without saying that having code that can crash with a the equivalent of a null pointer dereference is still highly undesirable in a public-facing web server, even if it doesn&#x27;t actually risk things like data leakage/loss.)",1404081617

For example, there have been a few discussions in various forums and blogs recently about how much of Real World Haskell no longer even compiles on the latest GHC and current versions of libraries. RWH is a book that rapidly became the go-to text for new Haskell developers only a few years ago, so we&#x27;re not talking about either bleeding edge functionality or a length of time where software written back then has probably been retired here.<p>So stability is perhaps an area where Go does have an advantage over the likes of Rust and Haskell today. Rust is still evolving as a new language inevitably will; it has not yet reached the level of stability needed for long-term production use by the general programming community. Haskell is also still evolving, but for a different reason: it is valued as much for being a test bed of bleeding edge programming language design as it is for being a practical programming language.",1404081215

7962714,comment,7962345,7962345,1,0,vorg,,,"I&#x27;ve recently tryed out Go for its Unicode integration. What I liked at first sight...<p>* the indexing makes a map[something]boolean act like a set. Sets and maps are so similar it always felt wrong for them to be two separate constructs.<p>* making exported functions/vars/etc begin with a capital letter. When naming important stuff, it&#x27;s a relief not worrying about naming conflicts with keywords. When naming locals, just use <i>i,j,p,q,p2</i> anyway.<p>* using <i>defer</i> and <i>recover</i> instead of <i>catch</i> and <i>finally</i>. The <i>catch</i> clause is really two functionalities rolled into one and using <i>defer</i> and <i>recover</i> decomplects them.<p>Other languages should copy those.<p>What I&#x27;m concerned about...<p>* printf and regex notation are used so much they&#x27;re really part of the language, but have an entirely separate syntax embedded within strings which must be learnt. But unlike the rest of Go&#x27;s syntax, they&#x27;re unintuitive, especially regexes for Unicode. Unicode is meant to be one of Go&#x27;s strengths. I understand quick parsing is one of Go&#x27;s primary reason&#x27;s for existing, but the regex and printf notations could have been cleaner. When you think about it, why are the arithmetic and bitwise operators generally part of a language&#x27;s primary syntax, but string matching and formatting delegated to sub-languages?<p>* statements, like if/else and ++/--, don&#x27;t return values in Go which is hard to get used to. I understand making statements generally be shorter so the code looks good after running through gofmt could have motivated this.<p>Overall, I think Go&#x27;s a systems language intended for quick parsing and eliminating C++&#x27;s complexity, and the author&#x27;s comparing it to languages with far higher level constructs. The correct solution is for people to implement languages like Haskell and Clojure in Go, making them execute as fast as possible.",1404080526

happen at some future time, there is strong historical  precedent  for presuming  that the present Gregorian calendar will still be in effect by the year 2000.  Since we also hope that VMS will still be around by then, we have chosen to adhere to these precedents.""<p>The writer proved remarkably prescient but,alas, Digital Equipment Corporation was not there to greet the new millennium.",1225283316
347364,comment,347019,347298,0,0,visitor4rmindia,,,"Good example. I don't dispute the fact that the command line makes it easier to do some tasks. I've had cygwin installed for a while now and I use the command line a lot but its power on native linux may be much more.<p>As you said though, it doesn't really answer my question. I'd genuinely like to know what is poor at API level.<p>For example, I could easily write a small utility that would display all the fonts on the CD. It would take an hour or so but the API's should let me do that (disclaimer: haven't tried it).",1225283312
347363,comment,347137,347137,0,0,trapper,,,"I respectfully disagree. For what it's worth:<p>The entire yahoo should focus on building a better advertising system than google. I believe they have the tools to do it. Google pushes ads to you by crawling your site and determining what ads should be displayed. What I want, and I believe others would too, is a method of pulling ads to your site completely programmatically. To do this, we would need to be able to classify links, and this is where the power of tagging comes in. My four steps:<p>1. Programmatic ""pull"" advertising retrieval with complete control.
2. Dynamic ads for single-page applications.
3. Integrate delicious into yahoo itself (e.g. have ""tag this"" buttons for each search result, and show tag clouds/related tags in search). Make these tags easily obtainable in real time for any website that wants it, which would be required for the ""pull"" model to work.
4. Integrate flickr into yahoo for the same reasons.<p>Advertisers will switch, because even as lower rates are on yahoo currently, you will have greater contextual ads and greater results with site visitors. You know your site better than google!<p>Advertisers want to be working on a mixed model. Google provides a push advertising model. Yahoo could provide a mixed model, providing push + pull at the sites discretion. I believe if they do this they could take back the lead. And, they have a unique advantage at the moment: delicious and flickr.",1225282645

I'll give you some keywords for the past ten or so: squid, webmin, texas, joe cooper (and the obvious ""swelljoe"").<p>Good luck.  (And, if you <i>do</i> happen to figure out where my parents are or their names, no need to post that data.  I'll trust that your google fu is above and beyond the merely mortal.  I will also be deeply impressed, because I couldn't find the barest of clues in the couple of minutes I searched...I really wondered, ""Is it that easy to track down someones family?"")<p>Edit: So some folks have decided to take me up on the challenge, which is fine with me.  But I will make a humble request that you not actually call or email any of my friends, family, or acquaintances.  If you think you've got a lead, just let me know via email and I'll tell you if it would result in an answer or another solid lead.  (So far, no one actually has figured out any friends or acquaintances to call, and no one has gone beyond a virtual search, as far as I know.  I'm just thinking proactively.  The Internet does strange things sometimes.)",1225281987

(nor were they suicidal. Koresh, when he heard the ATF was asking about him in town, called up the local ATF office and asked to set up a meeting so he could answer any questions they had.  Yet, the media reports that he was ""hiding out"" necessitating the ""raid"" on the ""compound"".)  I picked waco as an example because it is long enough ago that maybe it can be considered objectively.<p>The day of the incident is when spin is the most effective. Getting out the ""official story"", even if it turns out to be absurd or outright false in retrospect, is paramount.  It doesn't matter when the truth comes out-- most people will never hear it, and many who do won't believe it because the person spreading it, no matter how much evidence they have, is going against the ""official story"" and therefore is a ""conspiracy theorist"" and thus has no credibility.<p>This is how the public is manipulated into believing disprovable things.",1311396279

So it isn't really as you represent.<p>The iOS device connector has a USB client port.  This requires the other side of the connector to be a USB host.  Thus to make this cable ,they have to put in a little micro controller that has a USB host port (which many of them don't since micro controllers are more likely found in devices than in hosts, hosts are usually PCs and laptops, etc.)<p>And then that host micro controller talks to a RS-232 serial chip (or has a serial port integrated to it).<p>Its possible that to save money that micro controller is slow enough that talking to USB at 12mbit/s takes up most of its time since this is likely done in software, and it can only flip the bits for the RS-232 at 57k.

This is especially true because student evaluations have been shown in a number of cases to be very highly correlated with the student's expected grade.<p>However, I still agree with Panos' diagnosis that his student evaluations went down in response to detecting cheating.  He presumably has data from hundreds of students over years of classes.  The primary difference between this year and past years was almost certainly his detection of cheaters.  While removing cheaters from the evaluation pool may mitigate the problem a little, I find it pretty plausible that evaluations went down because of some cheating-detection related phenomenon, like the more adversarial atmosphere, his own feelings about the cheaters, or students feeling attacked or accused.",1311395275

2796158,comment,2795696,2795696,4,0,tlrobinson,,,"I think by coming up with ""cheating-proof"" assignments you'd be ignoring the real issue, which is that students think it's ok to cheat. Lacking some global solution, I think it's possible to deal with cheaters without ""poisoning"" the classroom. Here's my suggestion, based only on my experience in college and common sense:<p>The key thing is not to make such a big deal about about cheating publicly. No public witchhunts, no Turnitin submissions, etc.<p>Include your plagiarism/citation policy clearly on your course syllabus, and briefly go over it on the first day of class, but that's it. Don't have students submit through Turnitin directly, but use Turnitin yourself discretely.<p>Depending on the severity of the infraction, the first one would result in a stern warning in private, or no credit on the assignment. Subsequent infractions warrant more severe punishment.<p>If you let them off ""easy"" in their eyes (but not too easy) you're the good guy, but they'll still know you're serious about it.<p>On the other hand, if you announce you're using Turnitin, or otherwise publicly dwell on cheating, then students will feel antagonized and band together against you. If you don't give them a reason to discuss it with each other they won't. As you mentioned before, the social pressure among peers to not cheat is strong.<p>But by ignoring the cheaters you're doing both them and their non-cheating peers, and the university as a whole, a disservice.<p>Kids straight out of high school might not even know what they're doing wrong, and if no one ever tells them they'll grow up to be cheaters in life too.<p>Of course it's also unfair to the non-cheaters who work harder and receive the same grades, and ultimately the same degree.<p>On a larger scale, if a university tolerates widespread cheating the quality of their graduates will decline, which obviously isn't good for anyone.<p>[This is a repost of my comment on the blog]",1311395208

As different as a minicomputer is from a desktop. I think before long we'll see Apple launch yet another new category.<p>Even if we forget the special talents of Steve Jobs, most companies go downhill without their founder/s. Probably HP most famously. It's partly that others lack the unique clout of founder, as kenjackson says. In addition, founders tend to be insightful, energetic and bold (else they couldn't have succeeded as founders). Employees generally don't have that crazy extreme fire, or they'd be founders themselves.<p>But Jobs is unique beyond that, because it's rare for even founders to create more than one dominating industry. Jobs has done it with the Apple IIe, iPod, iPhone and iPad. It's that he can see what's important; and can make it happen.<p>I think his design talent/taste is in addition to this, and while yet another unique talent in its own right (and related), is not quite as important.",1311394153

On one hand, I agree that most reactions have generally been shallow and poorly thought out.  On the other hand, I think that what made Panos' original post so compelling was his comprehensive listing of the many disincentives to fighting cheating at the university, including the impact on his salary.<p>Overall, the result of Panos clicking more or less a single check box (and, admittedly, doing a few Excel tricks) to detect cheating was: (1) 45 hours of students crying in his office, (2) his class took on a powerful negative atmosphere, (3) his best students were turned away during office hours, (4) his student evaluations went down, (5) he arguably made less money than he would have otherwise, (6) he was called a racist in at least one public forum, (7) the reputation of his university and/or program was damaged, and (8) he was sent a cease-and-desist letter.<p>Ultimately, this is a huge set of disincentives.  It is not surprising that most would simply choose the more appealing alternative of just deciding that a professor cannot be responsible for making students want to learn.<p>What is most discouraging about the salary information is not the money itself, but the implication that even Panos' department was not willing to give him support when he tried to fix the problem in his own classroom.

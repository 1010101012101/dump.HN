This account is a non-interest bearing card account. When you deposit funds, we place those funds in other accounts. The other accounts are determined by what products we have available from our partner banks, and your historic usage patterns.<p>For example, if you start spending less, we'll move more of your money into an interest bearing account so that you can benefit from your financial restraint.<p>As you spend money, we (in real time) move funds to the card account from your other accounts to cover the cost of anything you buy using the card.<p>As our portfolio of financial products grow, we'll continually rebalance your money across these products to maximize your return.<p>This system automates what most people try to achieve, but banks make difficult to do: namely, earn as much interest on money you have and pay as little interest on money you borrow.<p>We do this because it is the right thing to do for our customers & quite easy for a computer to manage. Other banks don't do this because they earn significant revenue when people make mistakes in managing their money. We have none of those punitive fees, so our interests are aligned with our users.<p>(PS: I'm in London right now. What's up with English Bacon??)",1320782071

This is what killed us with 4.0.

We have a reliable release schedule that we expect to hit every 6 weeks.  Obviously, we do our best to have as many new features as are ready be part of each release, but we don't leave people wondering when it will finally happen because we keep to the schedule and release the features that <i>are</i> ready.<p>Some of the biggest parts of this release were actually groundwork improvements to make the add-ons ecosphere more comfortable in the context of rapid release.",1320782036

3212478,comment,3211224,3212359,4,0,kaib,,,"The answer is somewhat technical so bear with me. tl;dr solid modeling is O(n^3)<p>Computer graphics, which is what most games require, is largely a solved problem. An iPad or a WebGL browser is easily able to run most games from a few years ago without sweating too much. However, to model physical objects you don't just need a graphical representation, you need what's called a solid geometry kernel. What the kernel does is give you the ability to do boolean operations on two solid objects, something Tinkercad does with every editing operation. The problem is that these operations are computationally extremely complex, fundamentally O(n^3).<p>When I say we use a 100 core cluster I specifically mean that many operations <i>use the whole cluster</i>. So if a single operation you make in Tinkercad takes 200ms of cluster wall time you might be using 10s of CPU time. And the code we run on the servers is optimized and vectorized Go/C++ code, easily 10x faster than anything you could do in Javascript. A second consideration is that we use gigabytes of memory to do each operation, which gives us the advantage of much faster running times. So when you compound these, instead of having to wait a second for your operation (depending on where you are located) a Javascript version would take minutes or <i>hours</i> for every operation.<p>The kernel we have is unique, it is written from scratch for Tinkercad. As far as we know there is no equivalent even in the high end professional tools.",1320781985

The pricing plan (<a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/search/boss/#pricing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.yahoo.com/search/boss/#pricing</a>) is based on query type and volume.  Unfortunately there is no self-serve advertising model (meaning if you incorporate Y!/Bing search ads, the service is free).  It's important to note though that this is the Bing search index, not the old Yahoo Search index that is effectively shut down.  The original BOSS product was based on Yahoo! Search.<p>From what I have heard BOSS continues to do very well and is pointed at internally as how to turn an API into a real business and product.<p>One more note, I am now at Factual where we are very happy consumers of the CommonCrawl service.",1320781588

-----------------------<p>I'm curious, what's the cost to VC-backed companies for dealing with a patent suit?  I am assuming that most VC-funded companies in the web industry get hit for $100,000+ by different patent trolls. (Judging by posts on HN)<p>What's the cost of fighting one or two of these patents?  I'm assuming, perhaps naively, that there are a couple of ""key"" patents, if dealt with, would invalidate some of the biggest threats and the cost of fighting such a suite would be several million, say 10 million, which equals a large? Series A round?<p>How much would a VC fund save over it's lifetime of investments if just a few of these patents were to be fought?  Once again, assuming there is a good chance of winning.<p>What if several VC funds got together and pooled it's resources and took on a couple of the bigger patent trolls?  Could you spread the risk and cost enough to make this viable?<p>Are the politics of this so bad that you cannot win even with a bunch of money ( >= $50 million) thrown at this issue?  Can you guys raise enough money from interested investors to form a fund specifically dedicated to fighting these people?<p>This problem is due to lots and lots of money being given to various lobbies and politicians from the side that wants to keep the status quo. Why can't the side that wants change get together, pool their resources and do something about it?<p>I'm just a lowly engineer; I do not have the experience, connections, money nor knowledge to address deep issues, such as this one, in a meaningful way.  I'm developing skills to build the experience, knowledge and connections, but I'm very far from having them.  Yet I'm reading posts, such as this one, from many people, whom I consider authorities and whom I respect a great deal, speaking out against issues such as this one and do not seem to be able to do much about this.  This is unbelievably disheartening.<p>If you have the money, experience, connections and give a damn, do something about this.  It's always a small group of people who give a damn that accomplish anything.  Here's a problem that desperately needs solving and there is a group of individuals, such as yourself, who have the means to get together and kick ass.<p>Why don't you?<p>Only a small group of people who have stood up on their hind legs have been able to change the world.  The masses do not get together all of a sudden.  Every hive has a queen.  Even OcupyWallStreet started with a small group.<p>Grow some balls, do something about this!  Or stop complaining.<p>Every time someone of your stature (you have to be aware of your own impact on the overall startup and tech community) posts such a piece, it puts questions into aspiring entrepreneurs and distracts them from building something to research more about patents or try to patent their own ideas.<p>You'll need help!  We're here to help you.  I will bet that many people will stand behind you on this.  But someone will have to stand first and that person has to have enough __political__ and __financial__ pull to get the job done.  It's not going to be some engineer or entrepreneur who will be eaten alive before they get anywhere.<p>Cause if you're not going to do anything about this, please don't vent this frustration so publicly, it affects too many people.",1320779595

3212275,comment,3211229,3211876,10,0,anigbrowl,,,"I'll address a couple of points you missed (edit: but which you have addressed elsewhere in the thread - just wanted to gather it up in place rather than post 10 times):-<p>a. If putting a GPS tracker on my car* involves venturing onto my driveway during the night, then you're intruding on the <i>curtilage</i> of my dwelling. The fact that the mail carrier or meter reader is allowed to do so does not mean that I grant the police a free invite onto the easily accessible parts of my property. This is the basic issue that the Supreme Court will take up today.<p>* <i>not that I actually have a car - a cunning anti-surveillance measure, if I say so myself</i><p>b. Even if I park my car on the street, shouldn't the police have to deal with economic scarcity like everyone else, and prioritize whether or not I am worthy of investigation? If technology as a matter of convenience is acceptable grounds for carrying out surveillance, why not require all cars to be fitted with GPS trackers that record their position and can be read out wirelessly by any passing cop who thinks he recognizes your car from a recent tip? If we don't want to force people to buy GPS devices, then why not make such GPS data automatically searchable? Google Latitude records all my movements, should the police have access to that without a warrant for reasons of convenience?<p>c. In any of these cases, should we mandate that the information be public? After all, if a crime is sufficiently interesting, the media will sue for access to all evidence or to broadcast the court proceedings on first amendment grounds (spurious ones if you ask me; I've soured on TV trials). Since the evidence will become public anyway, what interest does the individual have in keeping it private once the state has decided to inspect it? No jurisprudence says that you have any property interest in your privacy, and it's not hard to construct an argument for any given search being reasonable. I've seen the presence of raindrops on a moving vehicle at 3am offered and accepted as reasonable grounds for a search (which correct intuition helped to catch a murderer fleeing the scene of a crime, as it turned out).<p>d. If almost any search is reasonable and can become a matter of public record by default, is there not an argument that possession of a GPS device in a car or phone that is deliberately turned off, disabled, or left behind by the user constitutes circumstantial evidence of intent in criminal or even tort cases? As you know, the threshold for establishing intent or knowledge in criminal cases can be quite low if it's not the sole fact in question, and it's lower again in civil litigation. If I can demonstrate a pattern of GPS use on your part that is temporarily interrupted during a period overlapping the commission of a crime that was reasonably accessible from your last recorded location, isn't there a basis for suspecting that you wished to conceal your movements?<p>e. Even if a warrant is required for me to get hold of your phone records or gain access to the contents of your phone, doesn't the fact that I could snoop your phone use over your shoulder whenever you pull it out in public compromise <i>any</i> expectation of privacy that you have when operating your phone in public? In other words, if I approach you while using your phone and suddenly order you to hand it over for inspection on the grounds that I saw something which appeared suspicious to me on the screen, are you entitled to lock your phone by hitting the power button? After all, your phone was open to the world (in plain view), and that's why I noticed something suspicious about it. Your locking of the device would then seem to constitute interference with a lawful search...<p>Sure, I'm playing slippery-slope here, but these are all cognizable arguments and I have heard as much and more from various conservatives and police officers over the years. I'm rather conservative myself where jurisprudence is concerned, but GPS tracking strikes me as an active rather than a passive sort of surveillance, not least because it necessarily involves interference with property or person to plant the tracking device.",1320779587

3212236,comment,3211493,3212019,3,0,kstenerud,,,"Steve's ""vision"" failed him time and time again. He risked his own money and lost it. He risked other peoples' money and lost it. And then eventually he made it work. It doesn't matter that he leveraged other peoples' genius and vision. It doesn't matter that he stole everything. It doesn't matter that he was a little self-delusional or that he was an asshole. Under his direction, his ""vision"" finally materialized, and was wildly successful.<p>Now I wouldn't say that being a narcissistic asshole is a good strategy or something to emulate (after all, nobody's perfect), but pursuing a vision through all manner of trial and tribulation is a worthy goal, and something to emulate.<p>The people who make the biggest impact tend to be those who spend years, even decades in the harsh wildnerness, taking hits and taking falls, but never giving up because they refuse to believe that it can't be done. And then one day they do it, or die trying.<p>These people look at a territory and say ""I'm going to conquer that."" Most people will tell them they're crazy to even try, and that it would already be conquered if it were worthwhile or even possible to do so. ""Just till the land like everyone else does"" they'll say.
And then these would-be conquerors get some other key people to see the vision and the possibility. They all work hard, doing what nobody else is doing, or would even try doing.
They fail campaign after campaign, but keep going, eventually seeing some success. And then one day the visionary stands on the tallest hill, surveying their newly acquired ""unconquerable"" territory, and suddenly they're not crazy, but genius.",1320779140

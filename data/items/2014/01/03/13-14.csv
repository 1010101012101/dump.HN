My company was bought by one of those companies that doesn&#x27;t list pricing up front. There&#x27;s never been a case where a single person could unilaterally decide to purchase their services.<p>What &quot;Call us&quot; means is &quot;Send us an RFP (Request for Proposal) and we&#x27;ll submit a bid&quot;. Why does this work? Shareholder or government policies usually require due diligence in the form of several competing bids. That means the potential customer has an incentive to contact as many providers as they can find and send them an RFP.<p>Ultimately the submitted bid is deliberated on by committee and several presentations might be required before a decision is made. You might think that I&#x27;m talking about massive deals for something like contracts for infrastructure or fighter jets, but no, I&#x27;m talking about simple SaaS.<p>It costs a lot to sell to these companies/organizations. The bids are usually hundreds of pages long, stating everything from features to datacenter security. Companies like Rackspace helpfully provide well written documents for this purpose, but you still have to write a lot on your own. The upshot is that thanks to the sales process the prices are inflated and frankly I see more money change hands over a month than I ever did in a whole year as a startup (a startup that was profitable and growing, no less).",1388757246

7005239,comment,7004864,7005167,4,0,stormbrew,,,"Well, they have a poor understanding[1] of the sequence of events in C++ if they think that the constructor allocates the object there (I won&#x27;t speak too strongly to Java or C#, since I don&#x27;t work in them if I don&#x27;t have to, but I believe that they both work in a very similar way). This would in fact be impossible, since many constructors are usually called for any given object (and all constructors in the object&#x27;s graph are always called, unlike the more traditional OO languages where the upcall is usually explicit). Also because where an object is allocated is a decision of the caller. It can be allocated with new on the heap, on the stack with a simple declaration, or at an arbitrary memory location with placement new.<p>In C++ the heap object initialization goes like this:<p><pre><code>    Obj *obj = new Obj;\n</code></pre>\nThis calls either `Obj::operator new` or the globally scoped `::operator new`, which somehow obtains an area of memory at least sizeof(obj) bytes long and returns it. After that calls to the object&#x27;s constructors are generated and called.<p>`operator new` is an allocator and the constructor initializes the raw bytes returned from it.<p>You can actually do the process explicitly in its entirety like so using placement new, which is a special form that calls the constructors on an arbitrary location:<p><pre><code>    Obj *obj = ::operator new(sizeof(Obj);\n    new(obj) Obj;\n</code></pre>\nYou can&#x27;t call constructors directly (except with a C++0x feature that lets you call them from a same-level constructor) because of the issue of how they&#x27;re ordered based on the object graph. They have a precondition of their parent class having been fully constructed.<p>[1] Note: I don&#x27;t really mean this as a judgement, understanding of C++ internals are pretty poor in a lot of programmers and for pretty good reasons a lot of the time.",1388754831

There is downward pressure to keep the government assessments low due to property taxes. Where I live, for example, the prices are generally off by a good -10% to -20%. Then you have to add interest, closing costs, escrow, and establishment of utilities on top of that.<p>You also have to factor mobility into the equation. If I own property that I&#x27;m using for a special purpose (let&#x27;s use an extreme example of a hazardous chemical disposal company), and I&#x27;m told to relocate for the &quot;market price&quot; of my property, then I&#x27;m stuck paying tons of money and dealing with regulatory hell in whatever I choose as my new jurisdiction to do this. This would quite literally put me out of business due to the insanely high cost of relocating everything.<p>Also, you have the legal roadblocks that often come up (this is the more common reason property can&#x27;t be acquired).

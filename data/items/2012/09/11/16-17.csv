Because you can lose 19 pounds in 3 weeks and then gain it all right back in the same amount of time.<p>You have to make a change that you can live with for the rest of your life, as depressing as that sounds.  But what has been working for me is:<p>1) not eating late night (this is the hardest for me but also the thing that makes the biggest difference)<p>2) eating smaller portions.  once you get into the habit this actually becomes rather easy.  just eat 1/2 or 2/3 of the portion size you'd normally eat.  eating until I was totally stuffed was just a habit I didn't even realize I was doing<p>one easy way to eat a little less is to skip the sides.  like if i'm eating a hamburger - skip the fries.  Or skip the bag of chips to go with the sandwich.<p>3) kinda watch the snacks and desserts.  i don't cut them out but just keep in mind if i ate a bowl of ice cream yesterday, then skip dessert today.<p>Aside from that I pretty much eat exactly what I have always ate. I have lost about 22 pounds.  I'm currently stuck at that weight because I keep cheating on my own system!  But I think it's important not to be too hard on yourself otherwise you tend to just give up.",1347382757

As a counterpoint, I'd like to add that from the point of view of an email sender (our company PostageApp is a transactional email service), individual Postfix (Exim, qmail, Exchange...) setups receiving email for small organizations are one of the largest headaches we face.<p>Large ISPs - Gmail, Hotmail, even Yahoo and AOL to an extent, are predictable. If you play nicely, tick the technical boxes and listen to feedback (SMTP return codes, FBLs, bounces etc) you get great deliverability.  Even mid-size ISPs and larger companies usually have some reasonable visibility - responding to postmaster@, internal blacklist checkers, etc.<p>There are, though, still a nontrivial percentage of organizations and individuals who run their own setups using anything from 1998 'standards' through to modern configurations, combined with other filters like custom SpamAssassin rules, an out-of-date Barracuda appliance, or quirky ASSP installs.  They often exhibit some unpredictable behaviours - sending permanent hard-bounce codes for simple inbox-full errors; marking completely innocuous email as spam; requiring three attempts for every email to block spambots (delaying delivery by hours); publishing broken MX records...<p>Dealing with these can be tricky - even finding the correct admin to contact is often an exercise in futility, all the while, the users are not receiving their critical emails. I guess my message is, when running your own email setup, Caveat Hack0r; if you're not in it for the long-haul, including updates, testing and responding to inquiries, you should really consider going with third-party providers.",1347382693

They claim to create around 512,000 jobs (<a href=""http://www.apple.com/about/job-creation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/about/job-creation/</a>).<p>However many of those jobs are in their retail stores which their business could at least in theory do without.

4506480,comment,4504375,4506054,4,0,Zimahl,,,"I have been developing Java since 1996.  I have a written a lot of Java so I'm probably a pretty strong example of a Java developer.  I'm an above average developer (and that might be generous) but not much of a hacker.<p>So let's get to it.<p>Is Java clean and beautiful?  Sure, it's easy to read and just about anyone who has read any other language can figure out what's going on.<p>Is Java powerful?  You can do just about whatever you want with it.  Early on it was pretty tough to get to the native level but that has become less of an issue over the years.  It still doesn't do graphics all that well so it's never been a great option for game development.<p>Do people love programming it?  Programming is tedious work and good languages help reduce the tedium.  I'm not sure Java reduces the tedium <i>enough</i>, it may even increase it.  But this is what makes it cleaner than other other languages.  Sometimes the tedium that it doesn't reduce is how others can come in and know what I was thinking then I developed it.  However, POJOs with getters and setters are tedium no one explicitly needs.<p>I'm currently working on a new project (in Java) that I found I was building more classes than I felt I needed.  A lot of getters and setters, object managers for each object, DAOs for each object, and each object itself.  All that before anything even makes it into or out of a database.  I thought if it would be easier in any other language and the answer was yes, but only temporarily.  Once this boilerplate stuff is done I would have a very robust application that is easy to refactor if necessary and just about anyone can add to it will little trouble.<p>That said, I've been meaning to try out scala and python.  I tried ruby but found it a little too <i>young</i> (but that was a couple years ago).  I also said I'm not much of a hacker so I tend to spend my free time doing things other than development.  I'll probably get around to learning those languages right after I learn to play the piano and can speak fluent German.",1347382601

Why does the site's owner need to be verified at all?<p>I believe we should have a SSL cert that only enforces the encryption but makes no claims about the server's owner or that any transaction is guaranteed up to a specific dollar amount.<p>I know you can self sign, but when the browser shows the user the site is self signed, they get nervous. Conversely, I could get a minimal identification req SSL cert from Godaddy that doesn't alert the user, but I have to pay at least $15 for that right.<p>My main issue or question is why SSL is paired with COMPANY/PERSON identification? Why do I rely on the CA to verify a company is real? Why aren't there 2 elements. One is encryption, one is identification. Encryption is free to implement with no warnings in the browser. ID can cost money to pay for the verification process.<p>Thoughts?",1347382580

It's not about how many carbs you consume or whether this food item would have a face or not. What's important is that you're consciously thinking about what you're eating.

Is this junk food or is it healthy?""<p>I've found that simply tracking my calories (not with any specific goals in mind) has helped me drop weight like nothing else.

People today are able to run applications written in the 60s mainframes without change in part because the radical changes in underlying hardware have been hidden from them by layers of virtual machines.<p>Of course there are many predecessors.

In fact, one of the main reasons I took my job offer was because during my initial interview the CEO looked at my workout history on the site and said ""Whoa, nothing logged since March? We'll change that"", since starting just under 3 months ago I've done down 25lb in weight and have gained a shit ton of strength. It's freaking awesome. Here are some things I've learned along the way:<p>1. I absolutely hate diets that consist of ""eat this, not that"", diets like this set mental barriers that difference between ""good food"" and ""bad food"" and can have lasting negative effects of ""oh god why would you eat that that's terrible for you"" which, combined with the fact that most do this to carbs makes you feel bad about yourself because you'll spend a lot of time on your cut thinking about the delicious foods you can't have.<p>2. You'll get much better results if you combine diet and exercise, you'll get faster results, and you won't have to be on such a strict diet because the exercise will make up for it.<p>I'm currently combining Leangains with a strength based workout program and have lost around 2-3lb a week consistently for the last 2-3 months, and I feel fucking awesome every day. I get to eat whatever I want as long as it fits in my macros, and my macros have specific guides set up to include being able to go out and get drunk semi-regularly.",1347381756

They aren't even scale ups of the simple IP routers for a basic IT data-closet that manages subnets and whatnot (already much more complex by dealing with vlans and subnets and dmz and vpn issues). At the level of big networking company they are a truly complex beast.<p>Just at the IP level they have to deal with (at the edges and across substantial WANS) BGP - a notoriously ugly and fragile protocol. Internal routing protocols such a OSPF are equally ugly and prone to breakage. Many are the tales of some small company misconfiguring their edge routers slightly (say a 1 char typo) and having the entire internet route through their T1, across their lan, out their backup T1. Other issues are BGP flapping, resulting in scary percentages of lost traffic. This doesn't even cover trickier stuff like routing loops...<p>Other considerations in big routers are things like ASN identifiers and peering points. Considerations like traffic cost, SLAs and QoS all go in to traffic balancing on such routers. MPLS clouds complicate (and oddly enough simplify) these things as well.<p>There are also important issues like Anycast, CDN and NAT that largely rely on router tricks and add to the complication.<p>Finally, on top of all this, is the security concern - you can't just throw a firewall in front of it, as many firewall issues are routing issues, therefore must also be present in the router.<p>All these layers interact and affect each other. Any given machine can only handle so much traffic and so many decisions, so something that is drawn as a single router on a networking chart may actually be several boxes cascaded to handle the complexity.<p>Oh yeah, and switches are getting progressively smarter with other rules and weirdnesses that provide horribly leaky abstractions that shouldn't matter to the upstream router, but turn out to add issues to the configuration and overall complexity on top of it all.",1347380671

The more you relied on carbs as energy before, the longer it will take. The first time I switched to a paleo diet it took about 2 weeks before I felt normal. After that passed energy levels will skyrocket. I no longer rely on coffee and have high energy throughout the day.<p>You need to incorporate more good fats into your diet if you are still feeling low energy this far into it. There are two sources of energy for our body, carbs and fat. The low carb flu happens as your body is adjusting from using carbs as energy to using fat. It's likely you have lost so much weight because you haven't eaten any fat so your body is eating itself (literally).<p>Examples of good fats to eat are: coconut (meat, oil, butter), avocados, olives (oil, whole), and animal fats. You should definitely up your intake of these. That should help with your low energy.<p>Reading about paleo, primal, eating real food, or whatever you want to call it would be helpful. It is definitely a sustainable way to eat. It is essential to eat fat though. Lots of people have done and researched variations of these. Regardless of whether they are ""fads"" it is useful educate yourself a bit before jumping into something.<p>[1] (<a href=""http://www.marksdailyapple.com/low-carb-flu/#axzz26B70TsmP"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marksdailyapple.com/low-carb-flu/#axzz26B70TsmP</a>)",1347380633

My gut take on this is that programmers have the same problem musicians have; although they may be in demand, they overestimate their ability to evaluate potential enterprises. (great players have about as much trouble evaluating whether a band is worth joining as A&R people did picking winners)<p>I started not only with an innovative and fun product idea which is fairly contained technically, but also very significant technical ability of my own (working professionally as everything from an SEO guy back in the day and a UI/UX guy for 10 years), niche expertise/perspective and very hard to get connections, marketing experience, a fairly coherent business strategy with potential customers expressing interest, and although I don't have a ton of funding I have never asked anyone to work for free or ""just equity"" ... ever.<p>And I still can't hire objective C developers. What's wrong with this picture?<p>Did I mention I live in a major US city. And I'm friendly and (usually) easygoing?<p>One conclusion is that I have an unrealistic view of what I'm offering, or that I am terrible at looking for people (probably both true) but another factor may be unexamined assumptions on the part of developers when they evaluate a potential opportunity. Perhaps they already ""know"" what a cofounder looks and talks like, without realizing their preconception exists. Perhaps they have a picture in their head already of what a ""good"" or ""successful"" product will be ... or perhaps they really want to be working on a idea of their own but are having trouble getting started, which creates semi-conscious ambivalence about working on the ideas of others.

It wouldn't interrupt the cool design and would give more information to folks like me who don't just sign up for every service for the hell of it.<p>The lack of information conveys a lack of product, regardless of how true that might be. No screenshots, no information on features, not even a contact or Twitter. I'd really rather get more information before I start getting emails about the service. This is especially true when there are already viable options like PayPal and Stripe, where I can go and find full feature lists.",1347379343

4506168,comment,4502856,4505249,2,0,lutusp,,,"> If you look at the mathematics there is really nothing so weird or magical about quantum mechanics or using it to perform factorization ...<p>Yes, if you examine the mathematics that's true, but if you examine the physics it's not true. The problem doesn't lie with algorithm design, the problem lies with putting them into practice in actual physical computers.<p>> QM in general is really pretty simple and even obvious if you ignore the silly mythology and just follow the math.<p>On the contrary, not at all simple if one must try create an actual physical realization.<p>This is not to suggest that the problems won't be overcome, only that they're more formidable than describing how easy it is in principle.",1347379319

261633,comment,260737,260737,0,0,mroman,,,"I think that part of his point, which he has failed to articulate, is that future programmers need to undergo the inherent rigor of low level programming so as to build the mental muscle - so to speak - needed to solve highly complex  problems.\nI believe a suitable analogy is how Roman legionaries initially trained with lead swords.",1217404130
261632,comment,261394,261528,0,0,mtts,,,"I personally don't see a desktop OS being ""game changing"" at this point anymore. We've pretty much figured out what we're going to be using desktop and laptop computers for by now.<p>But you're right in so far that Microsoft's all-important ""legacy"" stuff is by now so old it can easily be run in virtualization or even in emulation, so they're probably on the right track.",1217403625

261629,comment,261394,261550,0,0,mtts,,,"The jump from OS 9 to OS X did not happen when Apple nearly went under. It happened after sales had picked up again with the release of the iMac and similar hardware. Of course Apple at the time was nowhere near as profitable as it is today, but saying it ""nearly went under"" is an exaggeration. That happened in the years before Jobs returned and in the first two years or so of his return.",1217403375

261624,comment,261618,261618,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"But what did most of those guys actually accomplish?  rtm and Shawn Fanning, we all know...but did Mitnick really do anything interesting other than get caught stealing phone service and equipment and given somewhat unfair treatment by the courts?<p>I got my first modem when I was 12 and grew up around that part of computer culture (and committed more than my share of federal crimes by the time of my 18th birthday), but as an adult I look back on the whole thing as rather embarrassing.  If I'd only had access to real computers, I'm certain I wouldn't have found 2600 and the phreaking and cracking scene so interesting.  And, of course, the really interesting stuff <i>was</i> happening on real computers.",1217402315

It is insufficient to say this, but I think we are approaching this issue with substantially different experience, assumptions, and background knowledge. I don't think I am contributing much to the world by spending a lot of time on a comment in this forum, so I will unfortunately leave it at that right now.

261610,comment,260737,261213,0,0,Maro,,,"The point is, low-level, as the name implies, is at a lower level than high-level. So every once in a while, you'll run into problems at the higher levels, and you have to dig into lower level stuff to solve a problem.<p>So what do you do if you cannot because you have no conception about the lower-levels / overall architecture? I've seen PHP programmers run into bugs and throw up their hands and yell ""It just doesn't work! But the bug cannot be in my code!"". Of course the bug was in their code, they just have no deep understanding of even their own environment.",1217401474

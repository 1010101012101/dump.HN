A patent is a monopoly. A monopoly creates an environment where you can jack up the prices without improving the product you're selling and that's why americans pay much more money for pathetic broadband speeds than majority of other countries, while cable companies are comfortably profitable.

5823046,comment,5820470,5822748,2,0,Jach,,,"> why is garbage collection needed to begin with?<p>Computers don't have infinite memory. If they did, there would be no need for garbage collection. So if your program needs more memory than the system has, you either need to buy more memory, or figure out areas of the existing memory space that can be overwritten, or rewrite your program to use less memory. (Some embedded systems developers never use free() because they know their code is the only running code and know it probably won't use all the device's memory.) You can manually figure out and mark memory that can be overwritten by using free(), which can be error-prone if you accidentally mark a block of memory as available that shouldn't be. Or you can let the programming language runtime figure it out itself according to whatever algorithm (such as, simplistically, ""this block of memory won't ever be accessed again in the running code, we can reuse its memory""). Garbage collection algorithms can be a lot more sophisticated and use memory-sharing and other things, but the point is to make memory usage efficient and not something the programmer necessarily needs to worry about.",1370393299

5823044,comment,5820657,5822055,1,0,kkowalczyk,,,"You don't specify the ""resources""<p>Usually when people say that, they mean either hiring more people or hiring better people by paying more.<p>Given the very low quality of granted patents, hiring more of same kind of people won't help. We'll clear backlog but since the percentage quality will remain the same, we'll just get even more bad patents.<p>Hiring better people seems more plausible but is also naive.<p>The biggest problem is that patent examiners have bad incentive: they are judged by number of patents accepted. Since a rejected patent can be re-submitted ad infinitum (after slight wording changes), their best strategy is to just accept a patent. I don't know of any negative consequence for patent examiner for just rubber-stamping bad patents (an example of that would be firing people after N patents they've accepted were found invalid by independent re-examination).<p>The second biggest problem is that the standard for a patent is vague and apparently very low. In theory patent should be novel and non-obvious, in practice (especially in software) they are ideas that a competent people come up with during regular work and not as a result of some year-long R&D process focused on one problem.<p>Finally, given the amount of patents it's absurd that anyone can actually do a fair job evaluating them. This is not something that scales by adding more bodies because in order to say whether a given patent application is novel, a patent examiner would have to do linear search of all existing patents to make sure that it's not like something that has already been patented (not to mention the prior art requirement). Even if we limit the amount of data by trying to search only on related topics, the search space is still absurdly large. It just cannot be done well, which is why it's done so poorly.",1370393274

I work with clinical research data, specifically providing clinical data integrated with research data.  Mainly, I make sure PHI doesn't get shared with inappropriate readers.  This can be a grey area when researchers are in clinic with a patient one day and the next are in the lab with their research hat on.  Technically, all my work is covered by IRB approvals, which kick up HIPPAA requirements several notches.<p>Amazon put out a whitepaper on HIPPAA - skim it over, it's short and gives the high-level picture:<p><a href=""http://d36cz9buwru1tt.cloudfront.net/AWS_HIPAA_Whitepaper_Final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://d36cz9buwru1tt.cloudfront.net/AWS_HIPAA_Whitepaper_Fi...</a><p>I think you can tell a compelling story if you make all your web app access available over SSL, follow the normal warnings from tptacek and crew on how to encrypt passwords and then harden access to the raw back-end servers.  I'd recommend hiring a devops/sysadmin who has done this before.<p>If the security of the back-end is what your startup's selling point is, look into encryption options for your data store (e.g., encrypted by the RDBMS, or something similar).<p>Those are the types of concerns we try to make sure are checked off here as we work with patient clinical data and research data.<p>I guess the other thing to mention is that we use disk encryption tools as well - if a laptop walks off one day, we need to be able to say that (a) there is no PHI on it and (b) even if there was, you couldn't get it off (well, assuming that the NSA or equivalent isn't involved).<p>If you're funded/generating revenue already, maybe hiring someone like Matasano for a penetration test or process review would be prudent.<p>I'll ask around the research center higher-ups and update if I can track down a recommendation . . .",1370393224

GC just removes the need to call free - some algorithm runs around and determines what memory you are done with, and returns it to the free store for you.

As a programmer, your time is probably better spent on higher-level things than how stack frames are being set up.  Likewise with allocating and deallocating memory:  you will probably be more productive if you spend your time on something else, like the design or logic of your program.<p>Remember, programming languages exist <i>for programmers</i>, to make us more productive.

You are a thing. You have a recurring cost, you produce products, and they dont really care about the quality of your work unless it becomes a problem. What you are worth to them depends on the amount you are willing to take, your rarity, and what it would cost to replace you. To make more, you should learn to market yourself as a thing.<p>If you want to stay a front end guy, learn good design and develop your taste. Business people in general have a higher respect for designers than front end coders, as their work visibly and directly impacts the perceived quality of the end product. Being a designer also gets you more face-time with product managers, whos opinions are generally taken seriously by the money people when deciding your value. Being able to come up with both designs and implementations for those designs will help you shorten the development cycle on projects that you are assigned to (as there are fewer required meetings, and you are not going to push-back on yourself).<p>In my experience the back-end plan is a better (but more difficult) one. It will open more doors for you in the long run, and is less vulnerable to shifts in the market. Your work will have more depth, and its an easier place to set yourself apart from your competition later in your career. It's very important that you focus on learning OO first, before taking a deep dive into the language itself.<p>You CAN get to senior level without having a real understanding with OO. Anyone that does know OO well (likely everyone in development management depending on the company) will be able to tell you are a hack when they look over your code, and will be less likely to promote (or trust) you.\nFrom a development management perspective it is common to separate the developers who work for you into two separate camps: cattle (who build what theyre told), and problem solvers (who solve problems). At all cost, you want to be in the latter camp. If you find yourself in the cattle camp, it is easier to swap jobs than change that perception.<p><a href=""http://adriancheok.info/post/26835527269/secret-for-innovation-the-shokunin-spirit-of-japan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adriancheok.info/post/26835527269/secret-for-innovati...</a><p>If you choose c#, the framework is massive. This is daunting at first, but you will learn to love it. It is very discoverable (you can learn quickly by poking around).\nWhichever language you choose, find some heroes in your company, and talk to them often. Offer your free time to help them with their projects. Ask them to mentor you. Read their code. Ask them to be rough on you in code reviews. Never talk back to them, and listen to what they say; however remember that they are just people like you, and your goal is to get better, not to become them. These relationships will be important later in your career, as these people will help you get jobs later if you are good to them.<p>The language choice depends on what sort of company you want to work for. C# is not often used in startups, and ruby (as far as I know) is rarely used in large corporations. There are exceptions to both, but the exceptions are not what you want to bank your career on.<p>Whatever path you choose, this industry is difficult if you plan to be a world class player (where the money is). You should move into something you enjoy instead of making a decision based on earnings potential.",1370391774

For example, nowadays there are a lot of deals for dedicated servers with Xeon L5420, a quad core 2.5Ghz processor released in Q1 2008, before EC2 went public.<p>The sad part about EC2 is that it doesn't shy away from overselling while keeping the same high price.

Even big-name apps will fall off the charts very fast without work. There's nothing passive about it.<p>I don't think ""marketing"" is the right word, especially for a small/indie developer. You need to work to build a community around your app.<p>The gold rush is over, but if you build a nice thing and support it, people will find it.",1370390450

Profit?<p>Looking at their job postings, they have one person per city managing a team of people working probably close to minimum wage going door-to-door.  These people most likely scan mail at their homes using a scanner provided by Outbox.<p>Let's say they pay a City Manager $100,000, or $125,000 after taxes, unemployment insurance, and benefits.  An individual can take on 30 customers, is paid above minimum wage (let's say $15 after taxes, etc.), and works 7 hours a day (or 35 hours/week, making them part-time employees).  That's roughly $30,000 per worker annually.<p>At $4.99 per month, none of the economics work.  At 30 customers per part-time employee, the break even point is $100 per month per customer.  At $4.99 per month each PTE needs to handle around 600 customers each to break even.  100 customers per PTE at $30/month also breaks even.  But even 100 per PTE seems unrealistic.<p>Unless I'm missing something very basic, it just doesn't scale at $4.99 per month.  At all.  It's not even close.",1370390429

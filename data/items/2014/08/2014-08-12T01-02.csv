Rather than (only) trying to convince people <i>ideologically</i> that small government is good, Norquist-style, the allegation is that their policy is to actively try to sabotage the government&#x27;s ability to deliver social services, so people see it as inefficient/broken and therefore stop supporting it. Also occasionally a debate in Europe, especially around infrastructure projects (local/provincial politicians from the opposite party are sometimes accused of trying to actively cause a big infrastructure project of the ruling party to turn into a boondoggle, so the party can seem incompetent). In the other direction, officials are sometimes accused of cooking the books to make something that isn&#x27;t running efficiently seem like it is.

Microsoft case was a complaint about Microsoft deliberately withholding Windows technical information in order to thwart its competitors in the applications market. The case brought to light an Oct. 3, 1994 memo from then-Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, who indicated that Microsoft should withhold namespace extension APIs in Windows 95 from its competitors, WordPerfect and IBM, in order to gain market advantage for Microsoft Word.&quot;<p><a href=""http://redmondmag.com/articles/2014/04/28/court-nixes-novell-suit.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redmondmag.com/articles/2014/04/28/court-nixes-novell...</a>",1407807801

Finally the concrete company that does all the roadworks was the final contractor, I run out and explain it to them and the guys like &quot;yeah no problem, happens all the time.

And they could have blown most cab companies out of the water. Buying up inefficient operators, consolidating them, and bringing them into the modern world of technology is a really good business plan.<p>> Uber and Lyft are in trouble because they wanted to be exit strategy profitable rather than simply profitable. And they decided to do this by ignoring all of that icky stuff like liability insurance, commercial licensing, and following the law. In addition, Uber and Lyft tend to want to ply their trade in areas which are already profitable to cab companies rather than taking over areas that are underserved. If they were brokering rides in areas that can&#x27;t get cabs easily, they would have lots of defenders.",1407806136

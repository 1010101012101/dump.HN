4182041,comment,4181822,4181822,2,0,chanks,,,"I love Rails, but I strongly disagree with its philosophy of the DB as being just a dumb data store. Two things I would recommend.<p>One, the book Enterprise Rails. It's a few years old, so all the examples are from Rails 2, but the meat of it is about proper database design, including the stuff that Rails doesn't believe in (composite primary keys, foreign key constraints, check constraints, triggers). Chapter 4, about the importance of data integrity, was probably the single most useful thing I've read about web development in the past few years.<p>Most of it is on Google Books (although sadly, chunks of chapter 4 are missing): <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=thTju-4duY4C&printsec=frontcover"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=thTju-4duY4C&printsec=f...</a><p>Second, the best thing I did was replace ActiveRecord with Sequel. Sequel has built-in support for all of those things that ActiveRecord doesn't (I couldn't live without its composite primary key support), and is in general a much more robust library than ActiveRecord. It also supports more exotic SQL features like CTEs and CASE statements without forcing you to drop down to writing raw SQL (though you can certainly do that if you want).<p>It's not a necessary upgrade for everyone. If your app has fairly simple models and relationships, ActiveRecord will probably be just fine for you. But if you want to get better with SQL and get closer to your DB, I think Sequel is a much better choice.<p>More info on Sequel: <a href=""http://sequel.rubyforge.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sequel.rubyforge.org/</a><p>It also integrates very well with Postgres - there's a C extension for the Sequel postgres adapter (<a href=""https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel_pg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel_pg</a>) and support for adding common triggers in migrations, counter columns and whatnot (<a href=""https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel_postgresql_triggers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel_postgresql_triggers</a>).

He's what we do and what I would suggest.<p>1. Use Rightscale. You can get away with the free edition, but for $500/month the basic paid edition will allow you access to arrays and all the excellent scripts available on the marketplace.<p>2. The front end. I would strongly suggest moving away from ELB. We are using it and are about to get rid of it. The main problem is what exactly happened last night. If a whole AZ goes down, the ELB for that zone can get screwed and the DNS was not updating the CNAME to remove the bad zone. Instead of ELB, we have our own LB solution we are going to roll out that will use Rightscale server arrays and will handle the updating of the DNS names itself. We also aren't going to use Route53, because we learned last night that the API for that can go down and you can get stuck with bad DNS records.<p>3. Application servers. Use at least 3 AZ and have them evenly spaced. This is easy to do in Rightscale with sever arrays. Make sure your voting ration for scaling isn't 50% because you might not scale correctly if you loose 2 AZ. Keep the vote to 30% and you will be happy (if one zone votes to grow, let it grow).<p>4. Database. This is the fun one. We have been using MongoDB with pretty good success. Our multi-shard DB has 3 servers per replica set and has them distributed equally between AZs. We use 4 EBS drive RAID-0 drives for storage which have had problems in the past due to the outages that EBS sometimes has. Our best bet has been a watcher process that will kill the mongod process if there's any problems writing to the drive array. By doing this, the replica set will automatically failover to the next server and we won't get stuck with a primary node that can't write back to disk. For backups, we just freeze the writes on the secondaries and do EBS snapshots even 15 minutes. Rightscale has some great EBS tools for managing this for you. If you loose a server, we can deploy a new server in a matter of minutes and it will rebuild the RAID array from the last backup so we have a warm spare.<p>5. Monitor, monitor, monitor. Rightscale has some great tools for monitoring everything. Use them, and use more monitoring on other infrastructure (ie Pingdom)<p>Doing something like this will cost a lot more that just sticking to a single AZ, but you should be able to survive one, if not two complete datacenter outages.",1341074046

I don't understand your bizarro counter-arguments. Take the first for example:<p>><i>Taking a typical relative definition, if the middle class is [50-X%, 50+X%], then by definition the middle class always makes up 2X% of the nation and nothing can destroy it.</i><p>It cannot destroy the existence of the category named ""middle class"", but it can very much destroy its living conditions. It's not just being in the 50%+-X range, it's also what that range represents in purchase power.<p>><i>If you take an absolute definition of middle class (i.e., middle class = home with X ft^2/person, tv, car, refrigerator), then inequality is pretty much unrelated to how many people are middle class.</i><p>Only in a bizarro world where the wealth is magically readjusted to account for inequality. In the real world this inequality is caused by wealth moving from the middle to the upper classes.<p>For example, a company moves its factories to China. The middle class families making a living around the US factory and the nearby city are devastated, but the company executives get even richer because of the higher margins.",1341072877

I have been designing Random Achiever in my head for years. What direction I would like to see the company grow in, what kind of achievements I should create, what the overall feel of the site should be. While the awesomeness in my head cant be translated with my programming experience, I have created a beta version that I hope will draw some attention.<p>Achievements:
All achievements benefit the user in some way. Doing things for yourself have a low point value. Doing things with and/or for other people have a higher value. Doing things for your community or charities have the highest point value. I people were motivated to do something new for the achievement, I didn't want them to only do it once and be done. Achievements may be claimed multiple times after the achievement timer resets. Some are only a week, some a month.<p>So after the initial launch (4pm last night) we have a small user base, and a lot of face book traffic.

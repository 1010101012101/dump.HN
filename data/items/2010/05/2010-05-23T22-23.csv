Once you do the bottom branch you get the ability to read/write green and yellow, which largely increases what you can do.",1274655597

So please don't feel depressed! Just steel yourself to work damn hard on other stuff, no matter how tired or bummed you are from work, and don't stop until you get somewhere you want to be.<p>Working on open-source projects is a great way to develop credibility. A huge advantage of this approach is that you build credibility with the right crowd - the ones who find the same things cool and interesting that you do. If I were you I'd work backwards from the kinds of companies I'd like to hire me and try to make substantial contributions to open-source software that such companies use. Either that or I'd make cool new library on top of one.<p>Working on a personal language is less likely, I think, to be externally impressive. Most people's reaction to that will be ""yawn"", unless you're able to demonstrate something fundamentally new about it, and even then there is a high barrier to convincing anybody. You'd be better off finding open-source implementations of some known language to work on. (I'm talking, strictly, about using it as a bridge to paid work. Obviously you feel passionately enough to make it worth doing in its own right, but that's a separate question.)",1274655410

If you can't answer these questions clearly, you aren't building a serious application, you're just playing around. (This does <i>not</i> mean that you can't change your goals later, but you should always be building towards a clear, specific target.)<p>2. Functional requirements: What are the use cases, and how will the user interact with the application in each of them? Use storyboards, mock-ups, whatever helps you to understand what the application will do from the user's point of view.<p>3. High-level design: How will you model the data and functionality you've identified in the previous steps? Typically for a web app, a lot of this will be about setting up a data store server-side and figuring out how to implement any interactive behaviour client-side. You don't have to work out all the little details at this stage, but you need to choose a viable technology stack and know how the big picture is going to look.<p>4. Start prototyping: Set up the basics, enough to represent one key feature or perhaps a small group of related features, and create enough of the model/database behind the scenes to support it. Again, you don't have to code up every last bit of HTML and CSS at first, but you need to have a general idea of how things are going to fit together.<p>5. Refine what you've got and add further features and more details to the model, until you start to see how things are coming together. Go back often to check that the design and implementation are still meeting the requirements. Go back to the requirements themselves and make sure they are still appropriate as you gain experience in the field and/or you receive feedback from users/prospects.<p>It's very trendy to just dive in at about step 4 and starting hacking away, at least among the young, entrepreneurial types who seem to dominate forums like HN. By all means try it: if nothing else, you will learn why steps 1-3 are important.<p>Still, please don't bet your life savings on the project getting anywhere if you don't at least know where you think you're going before you start. You might well find that you change direction on the way, but aside from a few high profile exceptions, it is relatively rare in reality to see a successful business where someone just started coding something up one day and fluked their way into running a serious, profitable business before time and money ran out. Good ideas aren't worth much without a good implementation, but implementations aren't worth anything at all if they solve a problem no-one has.",1274653635

However, this is just a practice to placate the consumer as on gross mispricings like a $1000 TV for $5 people know they're taking advantage and will either be happy to take the $10 off, or will cancel the agreement thus removing all legal liability on the company. However, if the $5 had entered the till and a manager came running out trying to stop you leave with the TV, well you just got a $5 TV and if they stop you, they get up to a $250,000 fine and you get yourself a TV. Quite ironically though, if you notify the cashier of the mispricing, most store policies will give you the item for free regardless of price! So the people walking away with the $10 credit are really losing much more than if they had honestly notified a manager.<p>One of the caveats is that the agreement is generally to sell X number of products at $Y price, and if they don't have the quantity of products to supply the amount of orders they can actually cancel the orders and later reoffer them at a corrected price, which is probably what Argos got away with.",1274653632

applied to a job at a decent software company which unfortunately I didn't get (though it certainly gave me an idea of what to improve if I were to apply again, so was positive overall.)<p>I'm working on developing a programming language; it's extremely early days but I have certain convictions about what is important in a language and in the hacker tradition want to make something that fits those convictions.<p>I, much to my regret, don't have a degree in Computer Science (though I do have an engineering degree) - though I grew up loving programming I, for somewhat complicated reasons, ended up choosing the wrong subject.<p>As far as I can see the following steps are the way out.

Keep the day job and work all the hours outside of work to put a product together. I'd like to somehow link this to my passion for programming languages, etc. - perhaps that old programmer startup cliche of a development tool of some kind?<p>Thanks in advance for any advice you can give me, it's really appreciated.

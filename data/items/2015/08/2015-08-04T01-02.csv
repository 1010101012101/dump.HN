10001212,comment,9991538,9998566,0,0,CountSessine,,,"<i>You can call any constraint imposed by the language a type and that may be true in the abstract sense, but what counts when talking about types in a language is what the language&#x27;s own type system has to say on the matter</i><p>What counts isn&#x27;t so much what the specification calls a &#x27;type&#x27; but rather how the compiler does type reduction - and with all of the compilers I&#x27;ve worked with, argument decorators like &#x27;in&#x27; & &#x27;out&#x27; are typically handled during type reduction.<p><i>depending on how the compiler chooses to pass the values. Note that even &#x27;in out&#x27; parameters may be passed by value through a &#x27;pass by copy-in copy-out&#x27; mechanism, so whether a parameter is passed by value or reference is largely handled behind the scenes, so the type system doesn&#x27;t include that information. If it did, Ada would be even more verbose and unwieldy than its reputation suggests, as type enforcement is much more strict in Ada.</i><p>Very interesting! I know very little about Ada - other than that it has generally been considered as a safer alternative to C for applications-programming in the aerospace software world.<p>At the same time, I can say that without the ability to determine the <i>how</i> of how the compiler will pass arguments - by value, by copy, by reverse copy, by reference - I wouldn&#x27;t consider Ada to be an alternative to C in the systems-programming domain, any more than I would consider Haskell or Javascript to be systems-programming languages. Your original claim, in your words, was that <i>&#x27;const&#x27; in C and C++ is broken.</i> C, or any other systems-programming language, simply has more constraints on what <i>const</i> could possibly be. The Ada approach to handling <i>const</i> would simply never work in C with C&#x27;s implementation guarantees. To pseudo-quote a great man, Dennis Ritchie,<p><i>If you want</i> magical argument passing, sometimes resulting in silent and unexpected argument copying, <i>you know where to get it.</i>",1438653547

We launched out of a Harvard University materials science lab a year ago, and just closed a $12M Series-A. We are actively seeking full time junior and senior software developers.<p>I am hiring developers interested in 3D printing who have experience with web technologies like Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and WebGL. We are also looking for embedded software developers to work on our printer firmware, and anyone interested in computational geometry.<p>And finally one role that may be a little different than what is out there is someone to manage &quot;DevOps&quot; on our printer. Our device runs linux on an internal single board computer. If you have experience managing linux systems on machines with limited resources then this job is for you.

They had screencasting working and controlled it with an app on their phone.  It was a little buggy and froze once, but totally worth the amount I backed them for.  Around this time they decided to redesign the sticks with more processing power.  I figured respinning the boards would take a while, but the software looked so good in January that I never thought it would be what brought the project to a halt.<p>Personally I&#x27;d be fine with transcoding videos on the fly from another machine to remove the DRM, but I suppose that defeats the purpose of a small hdmi stick if you have a full powered desktop running in the next room over. But really most of the stuff on my local netowrk doesn&#x27;t have DRM and I don&#x27;t do a whole lot of online streaming beyond Amazon Prime and I have an app on my TV for that.  I suppose all I really wanted was screencasting without having to pay $100 for a WiDi adapter.  Oh well.<p>But at least I&#x27;m getting a refund, so I don&#x27;t suppose I have any ill will for the team.  I have backed projects before that did a magic trick with my money - one shoe KS took $130 for a pair of boots and kept up a sham for almost a year, even claiming that production had started and we would see our boots in a few weeks (it was always just a few weeks away), and then abruptly vanished.

That meme that computers are obsolete within 6 months of purchase is no longer valid, they&#x27;re good pretty much until the physical components break down.

I think I have pretty much the same aspirations.<p>The short answer is find a partner who is great at marketing, so he or she can add momentum to your ideas. It&#x27;s tricky since they need to share your vision and belief that what you are creating is genuinely worthwhile.<p>Also - if you want to create something of real quality and value - then it helps to not have to worry about that money thang, at least for a while. So either have money, make money, find investors, or do what Larry and Sergei did - work on your PhD that you can one day commercialize.<p>If you are worried about making rent and getting food, then it&#x27;s hard to truly create something of quality unless you have honed your craft and are in the service / agency business. Even then, its hard as heck.<p>Finally, quality isn&#x27;t just craftsmanhip but also completeness. A chair can be of utmost quality but it&#x27;s incomplete without a table. But completeness takes time. Say you wanted to create the perfect AI based mobile personal assistant, a la Siri. Can you truly make it high quality for every single use case? for someone searching restaurants in Austin to someone trying to find the latest NASCAR results? Probably not in a reasonable time frame. So you try and have a lot of discipline to tackle a very small surface area of the problem and then build from there. So in that little niche area, your solution is both quality and complete.<p>In my limited experience, identifying the niche and having the discipline to stick to it initially and gradually scale up from there is the hardest part of entrepreneurship.<p>Good luck creating quality. The world sure needs it.",1438651856

In particular, one matches problems to generalized patterns, which in math often has the feel of transforming a problem into another form.<p>1. If you&#x27;re going to take a test for school, you can recognize patterns pretty easily. For example, Harvard has a 3-day Qualifying Exam as a PhD requirement, given twice a year. Once, after looking at the exam pages for the first two days, I said &quot;Hmm, there hasn&#x27;t been a Schwarz Reflection Principle question yet.&quot;<p>The next evening, I got a nice hug from Lisa Mantini. :)<p>2. If you&#x27;re doing actual research math, it&#x27;s of course much harder. For example, the theorem in my thesis was scooped by a few months by Neyman and Mertens. What&#x27;s more, they did it as a special case of a fixed-point theorem, while I just proved it by brute force.<p>And now some simpler anecdotes from my undergraduate days.<p>3. In my E&M course, we were supposed to work out fields for a cylindrical wire with an off-center cylindrical hole. This was a LOT easier in curvilinear coordinates than Euclidean. When I showed that to the professor in his office, he literally stood up and applauded.<p>4. In an abstract algebra course, there was a typo in the book for one of the exercises as to whether a certain polynomial was reducible. I solved the hard form by transforming the problem into one about a polynomial with matrix variables.<p>I took that story with me when I went to graduate school. Ron Livne&#x27;s eyes lit up, and he transformed it again into something about -- well, into something about transformations on the polynomial&#x27;s complex roots.",1438651661

They can&#x27;t just walk away from the project with a shrug should it fail: they have a contractual obligation to demonstrate that they did not squander their funds and to provide the best possible outcome to their backers. If they fail to do that, the terms of the agreement allow backers to seek legal action:<p>> The creator is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their project. If they’re unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, they may be subject to legal action by backers.<p>In this case, Matchstick&#x27;s project creators have assessed that they have enough money to pay everyone back, so they&#x27;re doing exactly what the terms of the Kickstarter agreement between backers and project owners have obligated them to do: provide the best possible resolution to backers by, in part, returning the money.<p>Another project may determine that they can&#x27;t pay everyone back: in that case, they&#x27;re subject to the requirement that they &quot;demonstrate that they’ve used funds appropriately and made every reasonable effort to complete the project as promised&quot;. If they can&#x27;t do that to the satisfaction of every backer, they&#x27;re still on the hook.

We’re hiring for our data team.<p>It turns out that most of the work in machine learning and data science is around managing and scaling data. So we’re going to focus on developing this talent in house: we’ll hire smart full stack engineers and train them to get better at building data systems at scale. This opportunity to learn and level up is unparalleled.<p>There are a few dimensions here:<p><pre><code>  - scaling data infrastructure
  - managing distributed systems
  - manipulating and managing data
  - acquiring, cleaning, and modeling data from 3rd party APIs and crawling
  - applying machine learning algorithms, including some math to know why
  - software engineering and systems design
</code></pre>
It’s good to have some familiarity with our environment to hit the ground running. We write code in Python, deploy on Heroku, and use Postgres, Redis, and AWS data stores. We use the python data and machine learning libraries like numpy, scipy, pandas, and scikit-learn.<p>Email me: ivan@yesgraph.com",1438650043

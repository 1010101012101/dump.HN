It helps that the cheapest, most accessible foods are also the most healthful — and that your ancestors have spent centuries developing ways to make them taste good. It’s hard to get through the day in Ikaria without walking up 20 hills. You’re not likely to ever feel the existential pain of not belonging or even the simple stress of arriving late. Your community makes sure you’ll always have something to eat, but peer pressure will get you to contribute something too. You’re going to grow a garden, because that’s what your parents did, and that’s what your neighbors are doing.<p>Great article.  This importance of pervasive cultural factors was the key insight for me.  I follow an unusual diet that happens to consist of 100% unprocessed foods.  I allow myself to sleep when I&#x27;m tired.  I live somewhere I can enjoy long walks and other fun exercise.  I&#x27;m never late because I don&#x27;t set schedules.<p>> In the United States, you can’t go to a movie, walk through the airport or buy cough medicine without being routed through a gantlet of candy bars, salty snacks and sugar-sweetened beverages. The processed-food industry spends more than $4 billion a year tempting us to eat. How do you combat that? Discipline is a good thing, but discipline is a muscle that fatigues. Sooner or later, most people cave in to relentless temptation.<p>This is the trouble with following a different lifestyle; almost every aspect of it conflicts with modern culture.  Buying vegetables at a store, there&#x27;s tasty frozen pizza across the isle.  Going out with friends, for variety and a normal social atmosphere, modern-influenced food is the only option.  Walk into a gas station and there&#x27;s the chips.  Look at cat pics on the internet and there&#x27;s pictures of beer and bacon.  Everyone wants to set a schedule, out of habit if not the belief that stress increases productivity.  People call to talk late at night.<p>Even after forming good habits, every instance of conflict with the culture requires some willpower, and socially, each requires an explanation.  The only way I&#x27;ve succeeded is when living a more isolated lifestyle, somewhere remote.  That leaves out cultural enjoyment and reinforcement.",1423553008

With that in place, the puzzles came together relatively quickly. Some people at DARPA knew about the concept of little yellow dots, but didn&#x27;t think much of it. I don&#x27;t blame them.

We used to use GWT for several projects, but ditched for new ones to simple Java backend and AngularJS.\nNow when I had to fix some bugs, etc it feels so unpleasant to work and kinda slow (for dev). Project still uses old GWT 2.5 since transition to new version & 3th party component replacement would cost too much.<p>Do you use modern super dev mode and latest GWT version? How this turned out? Are there 3th party plugins repository?",1423551749

9025766,comment,9023254,9025151,0,0,xaa,,,"OK, then I misjudged your situation a bit, and in this case, your problem is likely not the code side of things, but the communication side.<p>One thing is that you are obviously down on yourself. That is self-defeating and self-reinforcing, because if you are unconfident, people will also assume that there&#x27;s a reason, and most likely the reason is that you are incompetent. It&#x27;s not fair, but it&#x27;s true, and it&#x27;s very easy for people to sense if you&#x27;re not confident. This is independent of whether you actually ARE competent or not.<p>Also, if someone says or implies that you aren&#x27;t competent (as it sounds like your boss did), that does not mean they&#x27;re right. YOU are in the best position to know your strengths and weaknesses, and rather than telling yourself &quot;I&#x27;m not good at this, I should take a job in tech support&quot;, you should be asking yourself, &quot;how do I get (even) better?&quot;. Which you have, in this post, and that&#x27;s a great start. It helps to remember how far you&#x27;ve come since you started. If a boss repeatedly treats you as if you were incompetent, it&#x27;s time to find a new one. A good boss will be helping you get better, always challenging you but not throwing you in over your head, and giving you a good deal of independence. I myself would prefer independence, challenge, and feeling valued at the expense of a less shiny title or even a pay cut, but that&#x27;s a personal choice.<p>Secondly, people do not make hiring decisions solely or perhaps even primarily on technical skill. In my experience, they want a candidate who has a certain skill threshold, and above that, they weigh other factors. Those factors typically include: how well do they fit in with the team, how self-directed are they, how well can they communicate to find what the real problems are, and can they solve them. So, in an interview, unless the interviewer is an idiot, you will get more &quot;points&quot; for clearly showing that you know HOW to solve the problem rather than showing you can write a syntactically correct program on the spot on the whiteboard. Again, communication.<p>I would be remiss if I didn&#x27;t add that it helps a lot as an applicant to know or be known by someone at the company. That is the real purpose of using GitHub as a resume: not so you can say, here, look at a sample of my code, but so that someone you&#x27;re interviewing with might say: &quot;OH, you&#x27;re the author of the widely-used XYZ library? Well, we can just skip the formalities and start discussing salary.&quot; I can almost guarantee that if one of your repos has a few hundred stars, you will not get any negative comments about your coding style.<p>Finally, your referencing Python as a prototyping language and mention of JIRA make me strongly suspect that you&#x27;re at a BigCorp. BigCorps are, in my opinion, not a good place to learn, grow, and get independence. You will be treated as a replaceable cog. I would apply at a place where I could find a niche, master it, and be valued, rather than be viewed as &quot;bug fixer #1057&quot;.",1423551654

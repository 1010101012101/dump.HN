More importantly, I lost the momentum, which should have carried me to much greater wealth.<p>With the lessons learned, being poor is only a temporary state that will be in the past soon enough.  This makes me feel just fine about writing all the details of what I did right and wrong for those who are interested.  It will just take time.<p>Shafqat, I'm all over the web!  I'm surprised you couldn't find me.  Not to mention the links on my blog.  :-)<p>Thanks again everyone, more to follow soon.<p>John.",1218718266

276026,comment,275720,276011,0,0,ian,,,"Sorry about that truebosko. We're working on extending our coverage to Canada & Australia over the next months. We focused initially on getting as comprehensive as possible in the UK and US (focusing on doing a good job in a specific niche) before adding other countries. Live music has a really long tail and we want to build a product that really hard core live music fans like ourselves will trust. Canada is coming soon though. We've got a big integration with Songbird launching next week and their community is asking for that pretty loudly as well!",1218718040

The conservative would then proceed to argue that his definition of ""progressive taxation"" is adequate for the discussion at hand.<p>I'm probably just making a big deal out of nothing. I'm just flummoxed at why his own technical field's definition has anything to do with communication directed at a non-technical audience.<p>Perhaps he used it like that to get the response you gave?

And it's largely because of stuff.""<p>That was George Carlin's take on it as well: ""That's all your house is: a place to keep your stuff. If you didn't have so much stuff, you wouldn't need a house. You could just walk around all the time. A house is just a pile of stuff with a cover on it.""<p>I have a fairly large house, and it's a lot like computer memory, the amount of stuff expands to the capacity available.",1218715306

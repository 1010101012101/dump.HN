Granted, it is still early days to be forming any formal concluions, but the data that is available shows a significant change. Even if we can point to neonicotinoids as the cause, where do we go from here if changing our handling strategies resolves the problem?",1439006361

Fry&#x27;s employees don&#x27;t actually get paid hourly wages anymore, they need to write up merchandise that customers buy which have a per-item commission attached (generally .50- $5 per item, high margin items might be $5-$15). If an employee doesn&#x27;t make their weekly minimum wage quota, they go into a debt (minimum hourly wage will be paid, but the difference is made into pseudo-debt), if they don&#x27;t sell enough to get out of their debt or if they arn&#x27;t making their large warranty quotas, they will be fired. Apparently Fry&#x27;s used to offer their employees much better benefits, hourly + higher commissions, and there used to be some sort of &quot;retirement&quot; type bonus system where they earned a growing lumpsum of money that would only be paid out if they stuck with the company for more than 6 years or so, but they&#x27;ve scraped hourly pay for the commission-debt system, removed departments and dropped those employees into sales positions, and generally just cut corners everywhere possible without any real modernization.<p>Within the last few years they&#x27;ve pushed to match internet prices which is nice if you know their policy (limited list of official retailers, item must be in stock at that time, sometimes they arbitrarily add shipping costs). You&#x27;ll piss off the sales person that writes you the price matched quote because they&#x27;ll lose any normal commission. From talking to the employees, it&#x27;s a toxic work environment and the entire store is feverishly being badgered to meet quotas for warranty sales.<p>Fry&#x27;s is a crazy store, it&#x27;s in a position to be cutting edge for the maker scene where Best Buy, and Radio Shack have failed, but it&#x27;s still stuck behind 20 years and ridiculously inefficient and short sighted corporatcracy.

10026215,comment,10014600,10024844,0,0,slisla,,,"Try this book: One Small Step Can Change Your Life; basically the author is a cognitive psychologist who studied various business processes and came to the conclusion that the ones that were most effective were not necessarily the best, they just worked because they were put into actual practice ... because they were non-threatening.  His research then led him to the following insight: big planning is perceived as a threat by the brain because in the past it meant 1 of 2 things: (1) no more food, gather the group and get ready to move or (2) some other group doesn&#x27;t like us, there is going to be some armed conflict, gather the group and ... Basically &quot;big picture planning&quot; while necessary if engaged too long activates the &quot;fight or flight&quot; response and you get all agitated and can&#x27;t concentrate and wind up doing nothing all day.  In other words, it&#x27;s not that you &quot;have trouble breaking things into pieces&quot; it&#x27;s because you don&#x27;t break things into pieces that you activate parts of your brain and nervous system that make it impossible for you to calmly focus on the only reality you control - little pieces.  So he suggest getting going by sidestepping/bypassing the activation of your &quot;big changes are coming along with danger&quot; systems by sneaking by them with the teeny, tiniest thing you can imagine doing successfully.  Don&#x27;t make it a goal to finish this part of your project or code for 4 hours or whatever.  Make it a goal to sit at the computer for five minutes, open up your environment and not waste time with facebook/hacker news/email for 5 minutes.  That&#x27;s it - don&#x27;t code, don&#x27;t plan, just open up environment and then walk away after five minutes and get a small treat - a glass of water or something.  Then instead of being overwhelmed your brain will be stimulated but not &quot;activated&quot; ... kind of like in the middle of the bell curve - not too aroused ... and you&#x27;ll think, &quot;Well, that wasn&#x27;t too bad, I guess I could actually do a little bit more.&quot;  Come back and just say, &quot;If I could work on a teeny tiny problem, not a whole lot, but something that&#x27;s been keeping me back and if I finished it and it became a building block I never had to rebuild and could move forward to, what would that thing be - and work on only that for the day. Don&#x27;t look at other stuff until that&#x27;s over.  If it gets too frustrating, walk away and then ask yourself, can you go at it again for 15 minutes without distractions?  Work up to a pomodoro (30 minutes of work of which 5 are a break).  In other words, you have to trick your brain and keep it &quot;asleep&quot; so as to not hyper-arouse it too quick.  Teeny tiny problems.  So small they&#x27;re laughable.  Almost an funny not to get them done.  So doable it&#x27;s almost beneath you.  But string together a couple of thousand of those over a few months and you&#x27;ll be very productive.  But don&#x27;t plan them.  Find one, do it, see where that leads you, take the next step, focus only on that until you did it.  Make it so small it&#x27;s not possible to get distracted.  So small it&#x27;s not possible to get overwhelmed.  Make your problem being underwhelmed, so underwhelmed you quiet your hyperactive mind down enough to let you actually get work done.  There are no complex anythings.  Just strings of simples, some strings longer than others, some strings connect to more strings, but everything is an individual bead and you can handle each and every bead.  Can you make a cup of tea?  Sure!  Can you do it while contemplating your place in the universe, and the meaning of life?  No, because you&#x27;re using part of your brain that needs to shut down the tea making part.  Just focus on putting water in the pot and lighting the flame.  You can do it.  Really there is no secret other than this.  You may forget to do it, but deep down you know this to be reality.  You even say it (&quot;I can&#x27;t seem to internalize this and repeat it.&quot;)  You don&#x27;t have to internalize it.  Here&#x27;s another trick: everybody falls of their paths all the time, then they have to &quot;remember&quot; what works and just repeat it.  It&#x27;s so simple it&#x27;s boring and that&#x27;s why we forget - because we get bored and want to forget it&#x27;s that simple.  But you seem to know this.  Just be okay with falling off, get back and apply it again.  Until you forget again.  Then you&#x27;ll remember you forgot and keep repeating this.  You got this.  That&#x27;s for the by yourself thing.  As for pairs or groups - stop fighting it and just pair up with someone with similar goals and workstyles.",1439004623

Sometimes I also do things like this:<p><pre><code>  is_admin = (membership.type == &#x27;master&#x27;)\n  is_current_group = (membership.group == session.group)\n\n  if is_admin or is_current_group:\n    do_something()\n</code></pre>\nbut I find this easier to justify because I&#x27;m adding something more than just the breakup of a line. I&#x27;m adding semantic meaning to other developers reading the code. In the example I gave, saying &quot;message=msg&quot; doesn&#x27;t <i>add</i> anything (as opposed to say &quot;message=bad_shipment_msg&quot;, but maybe the definition of &quot;bad_shipment_msg&quot; pushes the string past 80 columns by itself).<p>As for the example of reusing the message, maybe it&#x27;s bad practice, but I would end up with tailored messages describing the edge case (e.g.):<p><pre><code>  if not shipment_qty:\n      abort(400, message=&#x27;Must pass a quantity&#x27;)\n  elif shipment_qty < 0:\n      abort(400, message=&#x27;Quantity must be > 0&#x27;)\n</code></pre>\nEdit: I do the boolean definition thing more then &quot;sometimes&quot; because I prefer to make complex boolean operations easy to understand, and to also convey the meaning of what you want to achieve.",1439003908

10026191,comment,10025042,10025042,0,0,mindcrime,,,"OK, well, here&#x27;s an initial observation:<p>1. Your login page leaks information, as it returns &quot;username not found&quot; if you enter an invalid username.  This is a bad idea.  Better to simply say &quot;login failed&quot; in any case.  Now, thanks to a few minutes of playing around, I have a fairly good idea that &quot;admin&quot; is a valid username on projecteuler.net.   For the sake of argument, let&#x27;s assume that&#x27;s a real account, and actually has some administrative access... that&#x27;s a bad idea.  &quot;Security through obscurity&quot; is oft derided, but no sense making it easy for the bad guys.  Make your admin username &quot;flummoxedrabbit&quot; or something that nobody bothers trying.  As it is, I&#x27;m hoping this &quot;admin&quot; account is a dummy or a honeypot or something, but if it isn&#x27;t, I definitely encourage you to change that and quit leaking username validity information.<p>2. From the limited testing I did, it doesn&#x27;t appear that you limit the number of failed login attempts.  Or if you do, the login limit is awfully high.  I tried logging in 10 times and as far as I can tell, I could have kept going.  If there really is no limit, it&#x27;s probably not that hard to brute force your password.  There are plenty of scripts and browser plugins to sit there and try to login repeatedly, trying to brute force forms like that.<p>3. In addition to limiting the number of login attempts, it&#x27;s possibly a good idea to add a steadily increasing delay before accepting another login try from the same IP address, after each failed login.  This will slow down at least some attempts to brute force your password.<p>4. You could consider some sort of Multi-Factor Authentication setup.<p>5. You could also consider adding code to do something similar to what fail2ban does, and automatically block connections from an IP where more than <i>X</i> failed logins originate in some period of time.",1439003808

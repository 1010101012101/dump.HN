Reddit and TF comments always claim it&#x27;s not-for-profit. IsoHunt might not have as much profit as TPB due to it&#x27;s constant lawsuits. However, hosting a website like IsoHunt is fairly lightweight in comparison to hosting YouTube. Torrents are tiny files, $30k server bills per month at most, probably they spend $10k/mo. They have ads and paid membership. I doubt they earn $110 million, but I do believe it&#x27;s likely that they atleast earn $4 mill per year.

Getting things done matters more than being in a chair.<p>It&#x27;s clearly the right approach (particularly in tech) but corporate culture is what dictates if this is accepted where you&#x27;re actually working. If you work at $OLD_SLOW_COMPANY then it&#x27;s less likely to be understood then at $SMART_YOUNG_CORP.<p>> And I don&#x27;t think many of us expect to work for only one or two companies our entire lives.<p>Spot on. The usual advice I give is to plan on staying at a gig (as an employee, not a founder) for 2 years. Year one is for learning, year two is for shining. By the start of year three you should be either off to apply what you learned elsewhere or doing something new internally. The two year number is somewhat tied to the bonus/promotion cycle of the financial services industry but I think the general idea applies to all fields.",1382036102

Money in production seems to have better ROI, while money in development is a spin of the wheel.<p>Another thought: a lot of great shows get canned from the networks simply because advertisers don&#x27;t grok them, or networks bungle the marketing and scheduling of them. Perhaps Netflix can get into the business of picking up these wasted opportunities? That seems to have been the operating logic behind its investment in <i>Arrested Development</i>, and I don&#x27;t see why that model wouldn&#x27;t work for other shows like it.<p>Small anecdote from personal experience: when I worked in development at NBC, we invested a <i>ton</i> of money into a high-profile Aaron Sorkin dramedy about life at a TV network. It was a fantastic script, by a confirmed creative genius with a track record ten miles long. As bets went, it was about as much of a sure thing as anybody had seen. That same year we spent a much smaller sum on a quirky workplace comedy about life at a network.<p>Of the two shows: <i>Studio 60</i> lasted all of a season. <i>30 Rock</i> ran for seven. As great a show as <i>30 Rock</i> became, it wasn&#x27;t all that great from the get go. A lot of the magic happened in production, with the hiring of a fantastic writing staff and the time to let the whole thing gel and find audience fit. I&#x27;m not sure what the operative lesson is from that experience. But it did teach me quite a bit about how you can&#x27;t tell quality when you supposedly see it. Especially early on. :)",1382035087

News agencies are afforded capabilities and access to the nation&#x27;s political leadership that other Americans do not have, but I feel they&#x27;re mis-using these rights in-exchange for ratings - what ultimately sells commercials.  I don&#x27;t watch cable news anymore - but when I did, it was full of guests talking over one-another, interrupting one-another, or waiting for the other person to stop so they could ignore whatever the other person had said so they could get their speaking points across.  All the while, the host is cutting everyone short in order to say their 24-hour news network is just about out of time.  And somehow a 6 minute segment split between two guests yelling at each-other, jammed between a commercial for a pill designed to make your penis harder, and a commercial telling us how much a too-big-to-fail bank cares about the families of this nation, is supposed to leave us with an informed nation capable of understanding why they&#x27;re voting for the politician they&#x27;re voting for next time they step into a voting booth.<p>I wish the news was less editorialized, and more factual ... but it&#x27;s essentially been divided into two versions of the facts, and you choose which channel you want to watch for the version you&#x27;d like to receive.

Basically, if you just put type annotations at the API boundaries, you already get most of the type related benefits you would get with something like Java or C#.<p>Inside your functions, you can generally omit types. For the tools, there is enough type information floating around to make sense of everything.<p>If you use a literal, the type is known. If you use some annotated function, the type of the return value will be known. If you assign any of these things to &quot;var&quot;, the actual type will be remembered. This means you get sanity checks, call-tips, and auto-complete without having to annotate the types there.<p>Putting types at the API boundaries also acts as documentation. It&#x27;s so much better than writing JSDoc comments. Plus, you get all the benefits right away. It&#x27;s a very sweet deal.",1382035001

Sure, there is a premium price tag now, since we are still chipping the first blocks in making that technology a n economic reality. And that specific case is all the more important, since as you too argue helps to reduce pollution.<p>&quot;Anything that is profitable and legal is of benefit to society&quot; is a little misleading. The definition of what is &quot;legal&quot; is an evolving thing. We know it is dangerous, in that can cause huge fluctuation in the financial control system without real benefit for the society as a whole except a very small percentage. I am not speaking of a central authority that decides it, but our common collective consciousness that should decide it. And again there is not one thing, which has no obvious negative externalities. But the question is whether the positives overcome the negatives. In this case, for the society as whole there is little benefit.<p>Exactly, when the very society is built on that idea that everyone can pursue whatever they want, the access to opportunities should be equal. HFTs are tilting the balance in one way (helping the rich getting richer) , can cause economic crashes, which hit the rich and poor alike. Now the aftereffects of crashes on the rich (except in case of exceptions) are not as tragic, as in case of the poor. For the poorer part of the society, it pulls the rug under them.",1382034623

6567240,comment,6566304,6566755,3,0,timmaxw,,,"> Would these results hold in a matriarchal society?<p>I wrote up the following response and then realized that I was answering a different question than the one you asked. The following is an investigation of whether the tendency for child-raising to be &quot;womens&#x27; work&quot; is caused by genetic or cultural factors. This isn&#x27;t directly related to the question of whether the personality traits are caused by genetic or cultural factors. I&#x27;m posting it anyway because I spent an hour writing it up and don&#x27;t want to throw it away.<p>I did some quick research and found that even in &quot;matriarchical&quot; societies, women are usually more involved in infant care than men. I started with this article: <<a href=""http://metro.co.uk/2013/03/05/where-women-rule-the-world-matriarchal-communities-from-albania-to-china-3525234/>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://metro.co.uk/2013/03/05/where-women-rule-the-world-mat...</a> and went down the list:<p>* Regarding the Mosuo, this Wikipedia article: <<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosuo>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosuo></a> writes that &quot;Children of such relationships are raised by their mothers and the mothers&#x27; families.&quot; However, men are involved in raising their nieces and nephews.<p>* While men are heavily involved in child-raising in Aka societies, this source: <<a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=21z2hbOuTcEC>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=21z2hbOuTcEC></a> writes that &quot;The Aka are exceptional in comparison to other societies in that fathers are actively involved with infants and are second only to mothers in the amount of direct care to their infants.&quot; (pg. 5)<p>* Despite the existence of sworn virgins, Albania is patriarchical, according to this article: <<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_sworn_virgins>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_sworn_virgins></a><p>* I wasn&#x27;t able to find sources regarding childcare in Iceland or Meghalaya.<p>In addition, the fact that there are so few matriarchical societies in the world is notable in and of itself.<p>My hunch is that the reason why women are more involved in childcare than men is due to cultural factors which are caused by genetic factors. One could certainly imagine a culture in which as soon as a woman gives birth, she hands the infant off to the father, and then has no further involvement in its care. So there is no immediate reason why women must be the caregivers. But that hypothetical society would require that babies be bottle-fed, which is a recent invention; historically, children had to be breast-fed, and genetic factors are certainly responsible for the fact that women are much better than men at producing milk. So the women would have had to be involved in caring for their children at least at the beginning. This could lead to a cultural norm for women to remain involved in childcare even after it is no longer necessary to breast-feed.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s not to say that childcare <i>should</i> be &quot;womens&#x27; work&quot;. Even if women do turn out to have a genetic propensity towards childcare, that doesn&#x27;t mean that we as a society have to let that dictate our gender roles.",1382034598

6567164,comment,6566602,6567121,19,0,jonnathanson,,,"Author here. I don&#x27;t disagree with you, especially in the second paragraph. To some degree I think it was smart for Netflix to make a big splash this early on. But the perception that they&#x27;re &quot;paying for quality&quot; is a bit suspect, given that Hollywood itself -- ostensibly &quot;paying for quality&quot; in its entire process -- has a 98% failure rate on developing projects. Quality talent doesn&#x27;t always yield a quality product in the creative business. Even the best writers, directors, producers, and actors have their failures. I have no reason to suspect Netflix was any smarter in its approach to developing <i>House of Cards</i> than networks would have been -- though I could be wrong (and hope I am).<p>At the end of the day, the $100M for HoC was a big bet. It was a signaling tactic, a marketing tactic, and a bet on top-tier talent. But it was a bet, nonetheless, and an expensive one. That it seems to have paid off (to an extent? jury is still out) shouldn&#x27;t fool us into 20/20 hindsight bias. It could just easily have busted.<p><i>&quot;So as I understand it, the author is suggesting that NetFlix produce a bunch of low-rent pilots (or half seasons or so) throw them against their wall of subscribers with a bit of recommendation-targeted magic, see what sticks, then spend the money to produce the &quot;grown up&quot; versions.&quot;</i><p>Not necessarily, and I should clarify here. I think pilots can be shot for a lot less than they are, and I think audiences are proving themselves quite receptive to previews and other short-form &quot;pilot&quot; systems as proofs of concept. A lot of movie trailers are increasingly being made before the movies even start shooting (&quot;teaser&quot; trailers). I think there are ways Netflix can take the guesswork out of the <i>development</i> process, even if <i>production</i> is still an expensive endeavor.<p>You have to pay for a quality product, but the system right now also pays heavily for the risk in the pre-production process. That process can probably be de-risked considerably.<p>I would not recommend testing 100 half-baked concepts to see what sticks. But I <i>do</i> think Netflix could test or tease concepts in development to determine which ones to develop, and/or how to present new shows to the right early adopters.<p>Something I probably wasn&#x27;t as clear about as I could have been: half the battle in finding a hit is developing an <i>audience</i>, not just a show. Netflix has better audience-development capabilities at all stage of the production equation. It doesn&#x27;t need to guess quite as much as networks do.<p>Maybe -- to your point -- Netflix&#x27;s audience-segmenting capabilities give it the <i>ability</i> to play the big bets game more than networks can. But historically, people have been shockingly bad at predicting what will actually hit and what will miss. <i>Star Wars</i> was laughed out of every major movie studio in town, for instance, and at the script level, it sure didn&#x27;t look like &quot;quality&quot; to the eyes of the execs reading it. On the other end of the spectrum, a show like <i>Firefly</i> -- which fans (including myself) consider one of the most brilliant things ever made, has repeatedly failed to gain mass appeal beyond its limited niche, despite many attempts at re-marketing home video, a feature film, etc. The operative lesson here is that &quot;quality,&quot; as an objective concept, is hard to parse and hard to pin down. &quot;Quality&quot; is more of a function with a lot of variables, and many of the biggest variables are on the <i>production</i> side and the <i>audience</i> side -- not the development side.<p>Tldr: People are over-investing in development, when they could be investing more heavily in production -- whether at greater scale, or in greater depth per project.",1382033931

In hunter-gatherer communities the woman normally didn&#x27;t partake in the risky, competitive sport of hunting, she was the gatherer and the childrearer.<p>I have two young nieces that I look after quite a lot, one&#x27;s almost 2 years old and the other&#x27;s 3. They have a variety of toys at their disposal: little cars/trucks, barbie dolls, puzzle games, cooking playsets, action superheros, etc. I have myself <i>tried</i> in some capacity to steer them towards playing with the traditionally boys&#x27; toys: I display extra excitement when we&#x27;re working the little car, I walk them through programming basics like for loops in goofy and fun voices, I try to spice up games involving superheros (hey, they can do more tricks than the barbie dolls, so that&#x27;s easy!). But yet, they do have some sort of natural preference for girl toys. They <i>love</i> the cooking playset and the dolls. The cooking playset is the go-to-toy when they&#x27;re mad and crying -- it&#x27;s the thing that works, can&#x27;t explain how.<p>I understand that this anecdote is worth only 2 cents. I&#x27;m not going to make any conclusive statements because I&#x27;m not a female. I just want to tentatively say that in my observations girls and boys are wired a little differently -- and maybe it just so happens that the woman&#x27;s propensity to seek stability over excitement, security over competition lowers the chance of success in the current capitalistic system. But mind you I don&#x27;t <i>like</i> the current capitalistic system, precisely because the winning players are so often very risk-prone, resulting in the system being very unstable and unsafe for society at large. If we step away from a capitalistic system and step toward something more communal -- a society in which values are emphasized, I think woman (along with the rest of society) would probably do exceedingly well (or at least that&#x27;s my pet theory anyway).",1382033772

The C8 proton is more labile due to the electron-withdrawing carboxamide attachment, but removal of the chiral proton at the C5 position (which was once also an alpha proton of the parent molecule tryptophan) is assisted by the inductively withdrawing nitrogen and pi electron delocalisation with the indole ring.[citation needed]<p>LSD also has enamine-type reactivity because of the electron-donating effects of the indole ring. Because of this, chlorine destroys LSD molecules on contact; even though chlorinated tap water contains only a slight amount of chlorine, the small quantity of compound typical to an LSD solution will likely be eliminated when dissolved in tap water.[6] The double bond between the 8-position and the aromatic ring, being conjugated with the indole ring, is susceptible to nucleophilic attacks by water or alcohol, especially in the presence of light. LSD often converts to &quot;lumi-LSD&quot;, which is inactive in human beings.[6]<p>A controlled study was undertaken to determine the stability of LSD in pooled urine samples.[71] The concentrations of LSD in urine samples were followed over time at various temperatures, in different types of storage containers, at various exposures to different wavelengths of light, and at varying pH values. These studies demonstrated no significant loss in LSD concentration at 25C for up to four weeks. After four weeks of incubation, a 30% loss in LSD concentration at 37C and up to a 40% at 45C were observed. Urine fortified with LSD and stored in amber glass or nontransparent polyethylene containers showed no change in concentration under any light conditions. Stability of LSD in transparent containers under light was dependent on the distance between the light source and the samples, the wavelength of light, exposure time, and the intensity of light. After prolonged exposure to heat in alkaline pH conditions, 10 to 15% of the parent LSD epimerized to iso-LSD. Under acidic conditions, less than 5% of the LSD was converted to iso-LSD. It was also demonstrated that trace amounts of metal ions in buffer or urine could catalyze the decomposition of LSD and that this process can be avoided by the addition of EDTA.<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;",1382033621

For one thing, they weren&#x27;t totally &quot;blind&quot;: If you believe their spin, they spent a lot of time analyzing their audience to target exactly the kinds of shows they should make, and they have a lot more data to go on than, say, AMC had seven years ago. For another, if they wanted their subscribers to take them seriously as an HBO-like content producer, it helps to actually produce some HBO-level content right out of the gate. Once subscribers trust that you <i>can</i> make Emmy-worthy shows, they&#x27;re more likely to tolerate your ultra-targeted but cut-rate test-batch series.<p>Even so, I&#x27;m not sure how the suggested strategy is supposed to play out: Say they made 100 cheap shows instead of 5 expensive ones. In order to be more interesting to any particular audience to overcome the fact that they aren&#x27;t (yet) Hollywood-quality, one would think they&#x27;d have to appeal deeply to a narrow audience (I&#x27;d give a science fiction show about a generational ship a chance no matter how cheaply it was produced, for example). But now your show is in a trap: It&#x27;s too focused, and will have a hard time gaining an audience even when the production values go up (and how do you &quot;scale&quot; to more expensive actors?) Time travel geeks loved the movie &quot;Primer&quot;, which cost about the same as a small car to produce, but a million-dollar-an-episode show based on the concept has roughly 0 chance of making its money back.",1382033521

I basically assume that all javadoc/doxygen-style summary/@param/@return-style docs are entirely noise.<p>I much prefer the &quot;docstring&quot; style comments, especially though in Clojure, or Python.<p>Examples...<p>Clojure:<p><pre><code>    user=> (doc map)
    -------------------------
    clojure.core/map
    ([f coll] [f c1 c2] [f c1 c2 c3] [f c1 c2 c3 & colls])
      Returns a lazy sequence consisting of the result of applying f to the
      set of first items of each coll, followed by applying f to the set
      of second items in each coll, until any one of the colls is
      exhausted.  Any remaining items in other colls are ignored. Function
      f should accept number-of-colls arguments.

</code></pre>
Python:<p><pre><code>    Help on built-in function map in module __builtin__:

    map(...)
        map(function, sequence[, sequence, ...]) -> list

        Return a list of the results of applying the function to the items of
        the argument sequence(s).  If more than one sequence is given, the
        function is called with an argument list consisting of the corresponding
        item of each sequence, substituting None for missing values when not all
        sequences have the same length.  If the function is None, return a list of
        the items of the sequence (or a list of tuples if more than one sequence).

</code></pre>
And on the far other end of the spectrum, here&#x27;s some C# / MSDN docs:<p><pre><code>    Syntax

      public static IEnumerable<TResult> Select<TSource, TResult>(
          this IEnumerable<TSource> source,
          Func<TSource, TResult> selector
      )

    Type Parameters

      TSource
        The type of the elements of source.

      TResult
        The type of the value returned by selector.

    Parameters

      source
        Type: System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<TSource>
        A sequence of values to invoke a transform function on.

      selector
        Type: System.Func<TSource, TResult>
        A transform function to apply to each element.

    Return Value
      Type: System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<TResult>
      An IEnumerable<T> whose elements are the result of invoking the transform
      function on each element of source.

    Usage Note
      In Visual Basic and C#, you can call this method as an instance method on any
      object of type IEnumerable<TSource>. When you use instance method syntax to
      call this method, omit the first parameter. For more information, see
      Extension Methods (Visual Basic) or Extension Methods (C# Programming Guide).

6567028,comment,6565460,6565460,2,0,angersock,,,"So, here&#x27;s a story.<p>My first attempt at &quot;revision control&quot; was multiple copies of files: &quot;main.cpp&quot;, &quot;main_2.cpp&quot;, &quot;main_2final.cpp&quot;, &quot;main_2finalb.cpp&quot;, &quot;main_2finalb_forreal.cpp&quot;, and so on.<p>This scheme clearly doesn&#x27;t work.<p>So, in highschool, we started using SVN. We used it less for its versioning abilities than we did for its ability to function like a distributed file share (this was before Dropbox, which sucks rocks anyways). We stored lots of binary files in it (images, models, etc.), and sadness resulted, but it beat the hell out of the alternative.<p>In college, my SVN-foo upgraded--we used SVN properly: updating, resolving conflicts, and committing changes. It worked well enough, though it still sucked for binary stuff--and merging conflicts was a pain in the neck.<p>After college, we started using SVN more cleverly. We started limiting our commits to functional changes, and documenting very carefully what changed and why. We tagged branches for release, and kept the repo clean. We moved binaries off into their own repo.<p>At my first gig, we used SVN with Eclipse, which was pretty awesome. It had great merge functionality, it had great team support, and I even learned how to branch from mainline development in order to do my own projects. I did not learn, however, how to merge said branches back in any way which did not involve madness and suffering. Oh, and people would sometimes break the build, and if you were lucky you read that email (if they sent it!) before you updated in the morning.<p>My first few encounters with git were again using it as a distributed file share, this time hosted on Github--from hackathons and the like. I did not receive a very good explanation of it other than &quot;that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re using for this project&quot;; I suspect that unless you are really careful it is hard to explain to somebody new to git how to use it if you have experience yourself.<p>I later learned to use git to have multiple repos to push to, one for code, one for staging, and one for production. It was the most magical thing in the world--`git push production master` and then Heroku is showing my new website.<p>I finally learned branching and merging when doing my startup earlier this year; I&#x27;d heard about doing topic/feature branches, and we developed a workflow somewhat like GitFlow. I learned how that worked, and barring the occasional screwup found it very, very useful.<p>I&#x27;m currently implementing a helper tool for CI and issue tracking with GitFlow-style workflows. I&#x27;ve had to learn more about how to use the tool, how to manage branches, and all other things.<p>~<p>git is a much more complicated tool to use, effectively, than SVN--at the same time, I think that getting there is worth it.<p>I further think that people starting out learning a VCS would be well-served to use SVN; combine it with TortoiseSVN on Windows and it&#x27;s pretty simple. `svn update`, `svn commit`.<p>That done, when you have a workflow where it makes sense, switch to git. Git shines for letting you rapidly test things out, and keeping you from stepping on other people&#x27;s toes.<p>I have used SVN for remote team work, and for certain things it&#x27;s great--library development, things where you <i>need</i> people not to sit on commits easily, etc. I think that SVN is a great tool for newer developers, and I think that it has uses to this day.<p>That said, once everyone is up to speed on basic git, your team should make the transition, because it enables you to have more complex workflows and do more powerful work.",1382032912

UDK related revenue includes, but is not limited to, monies earned from: sales, services, training, advertisements, sponsorships, endorsements, memberships, subscription fees, in-game transactions, rentals and pay-to-play. You or your company will only need one commercial license to cover all the UDK based games or commercial applications you develop.<p>>Here are some examples:<p>>A team creates a game with UDK that they intend to sell. After six months of development, they release the game through digital distribution and they earn US$60,000 in the first calendar quarter after release. Their use of UDK during development requires no fee. At some point prior to the UDK Applicationssrelease they would to secure a royalty-bearing commercial UDK license with its US$99 license fee. After earning US$60,000, they would be required to pay Epic US$2,500 (US$0 on the first US$50,000 in revenue, and US$2,500 on the next US$10,000 in revenue). On subsequent revenue, they are required to pay the 25% royalty.",1382032894

I use Ansible, which can be used for much of the same things.<p>Obviously Docker itself is for managing containers. The Chef-life capabilities are the building, repoing of images, and config files that you use with Docker.<p>Once a container is running, then Docker&#x27;s job is to keep the thing up rather than making changes to the existing container. That&#x27;s where something like Ansible might come in. Anything else you might want to automate after the container is already running could be handled by Ansible. For example, maybe you want to force a DB backup on all your X containers, then you could run an Ansible playbook to do that. There isn&#x27;t anything in Docker which would allow for that.<p>I like the flexibility of Ansible as a general tool, so I prefer to keep my server setup recipes in Ansible. Even if I don&#x27;t have to use those recipes often because I only need to setup one base image for each need, I still like to have that Ansible playbook. I haven&#x27;t tried all the new features of Docker yet though. I had a back off a bit a few months ago because I couldn&#x27;t keep up with all the changes.",1382032878

I was interested in doing so, but when it was feasible for me, I felt the stock was already much higher than it would be able to sustain for the long term.<p>Are you saying that you believe purchasing the stock at its current price would be a good long term position to take?  I find it difficult to believe that the stock could stay at or above this value for the long term.  I do believe it will climb significantly from whatever position it is at when the Model X and the G3 models come out, but I would be very surprised if it was still this high just before that happens.",1382032818

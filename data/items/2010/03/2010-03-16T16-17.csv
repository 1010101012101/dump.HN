1196143,comment,1196016,1196081,0,0,Silhouette,,,"You mock them, but I for one would be glad if a new version of IE supported rounded corners, RGBA colours and SVG. These are useful things where IE lagging behind has caused headaches for web developers for several years now, as we couldn't take advantage of the much easier ways of doing things in most browsers without having to write it all twice for IE anyway.<p>IME, the current trend is that there are still quite a few people using IE6 (the hold-out corporations) but they are dying out. However, a lot of other IE users, perhaps even most of them, do upgrade reasonably quickly now, because there isn't the same incentive to stick with something like IE7. Since users of other browsers also tend to upgrade fairly quickly because everyone has auto-updates these days, I am optimistic that even relatively simple steps like including some CSS3 and SVG in IE9 will make a big and fairly rapid difference in practice to what a web designer can use in production sites.",1268758719
1196142,comment,1194817,1195079,0,0,jwecker,,,"The _kids_ need sleep as well.  One thing we realized was that the constant waking up was not just difficult for us but seemed to put strain on the baby as well.  After a usually very short adjustment (3 days or so) our babies would sleep through the night, and so would we, and the babies seemed so much happier and more rested during the day.  So anyway I totally agree.<p>On another point, I would point out that in general adults are very, very attuned to having emotional responses to crying children (the younger the more powerful the response), whether we have our own children or not.  That's why a baby crying on a red-eye flight can have such emotional reactions from total strangers (often negative, unfortunately).  It's a wonderful human instinct that I think serves us very well in general.  But those who aren't experience parents need to remember the following (_please_):<p>* Every baby has a different temperament and personality.<p>* Babies sometimes cry to get attention and not because they are actually in any way uncomfortable or scared.  The different sounds are easy for the baby's parents to hear and difficult for other people to distinguish. (as mentioned, newborn infants are easier in that they always have a reason when they cry).<p>* They sometimes cry for a while and there's nothing you can do.  Seems to always happen in public.  Leg aches, colic, gas, etc.",1268758719

A lot of smart people work at Microsoft, it's not like they can't figure this out. Microsoft's business strategy involves differentiating IE in basics like rendering and performance so that you have to buy Windows, test your websites in IE, and I think they still hope that they'll return to utter dominance one day. In so doing, they want you to decide that it's only worth your time to support IE since that's what most of your userbase uses anyway, thereby also requiring Windows for the web.<p>They won't support HTML5/Canvas fully until IE13 at this rate. It conflicts with their proprietary Silverlight technology, so any implementation of such in IE is going to be broken and incomplete, as we've come to expect as the standard.<p>Microsoft wants Windows to be mandatory for web surfing.

That takes care of code and configuration.<p>I have a cron job that dumps the databases into a directory with a time-stamped name.

So if Paypal decides to partner with Bump to make a payment application, and the companies put out a press release, and a writer decides that is interesting, it counts as 'spin' in the study. Same thing if the White House announces something. Of course, journalists rely on press releases to find some of their stories. That doesn't make it spin. Things are much more complicated than that. Spin comes from simply accepting a point of view uncritically and not challenging assertions made by sources quoted in a story. Spin also comes in ways that aren't easily detectable, such as getting in with a source by being an outlet that is generally favorable to it.<p>Basically, this study doesn't mean anything. For instance, when Facebook decided to change its privacy policy in December it announced it to the press.

With permaculture, there is no need for Monsanto.<p>In <i>monocultures</i>, i.e. traditional farms, the tilling exposes the worms to the sun and birds and they are killed.  Without worms, there is no life in the soil and the nutrients must be replaced by petrol based fertilizers.  With permaculture, there is no need for fertilizer because the plants die and are composted and returned to the soil.<p>Anyway, point being, if we never used these companies' products to destroy the natural order of things, we'd have more productive land and no need to GMO tomatoes.<p>I don't mean to be preachy.

I wonder if AT&T prevented them from porting the Droid over due to their relationship with Apple/iPhone. When I called AT&T to find out when my contract was up, they tried to sell me on the Backflip - which, compared to the N1 and my iPhone 3G, is a serious downgrade.<p>(Adding an additional insult: three days later, I got a flier in the mail suggesting I re-up my contract by getting a free Nokia 6750 - a crappy flip-phone)",1268756516

1196017,comment,1195791,1195791,0,0,timtadh,,,"I have to completely disagree with rebasing the feature branch onto the mainline branch. That is bad idea. Here is what they are doing:<p><pre><code>   1.  Branch off of master to work on the feature
   2. Work, work, work, commit, commit, commit
   3. Pull down any updates to master
   4. Rebase and squash the feature branch to master’s HEAD
   5. Merge the feature branch back to master
   6. Push up to the shared repository
</code></pre>
Their Rational for Step 6:<p>""When you’re ready to share this feature with the rest of your team, they probably won’t care about all your interim commits (for example, you added and then changed feature.py). We can package up all the commits into one big commit (sort of like the one big patch against master you used before) by using git’s rebase command.""<p>Some of the history that was used in developing the feature may be useful for someone else trying to a) figure out how the code works or b) trying to fix a bug in the program. By chunking the development of the feature into on patch you eliminate the nuances which would have helped later on.<p>Even beyond the development concerns, version control systems have great power to model your actual development process. Not just the one that is on paper, but the one that produces the code which ships. By eliminating history of development you loose the ability to discover this useful information. So don't rebase your feature branch merge into the mainline.",1268756254

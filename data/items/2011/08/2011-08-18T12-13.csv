Realistically a 25k debt against a 3 year delay in starting a career  - you may well earn less for the first few years but by the time you've paid off that 25k, is the degree <i>really</i> going to be a differentiating factor?<p>With now 27k just on tuition, plus living expenses for three years, what's the point?

It doesn't seem to stop any attacks but leads to failure modes.  From my understanding, the new keys are transmitted over the air using existing keys.  Thus, if your radio is off when the over the air rekeying happens, you don't get the new keys and thus can't talk to anyone in encrypted mode.

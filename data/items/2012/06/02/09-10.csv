I've spent 15 years now developing software on the platform, both desktop and web applications in C++ and C#. I also have a Windows Phone.<p>I actually don't understand why people are complaining about metro and the use cases as I think they are fine.<p>The way a Windows machine tends to get used these days is that you drag all the apps you want to the taskbar and that is it.  Occasionally, you would benefit from some desktop gadgets such as weather etc and occasionally you use global search. If I look at my taskbar, I have:<p>Windows Explorer, RDP, IE, Firefox, Zune, Excel, Word, VS2010, sticky notes, PuTTY.<p>What I do on my phone is simply: Messaging, occasionally web browsing and checking the weather.<p>After 12 hours of Windows 8, I've settled into the following usage pattern that I actually find satisfying:<p>1. Metro has: weather, news, music on it.<p>2. Desktop has: everything else.<p>I spend a lot of time at (2) but switch to (1) if I want a quick status update of the world, which is simply a press of the windows key away and is just there! Also if i want to search for something, I use metro.<p>Otherwise I use it just like Windows 7.<p>The intended use case is not to throw metro at the desktop users - it's to augment it.<p>I don't get all the complaining!

Becoming and engineer here was difficult, but the difficulty laid not in the things we had to learn, but in the hoops they made you jump through.  With a few exceptions ---there are some great teachers here too-- it was more survival training than a learning experience.  Later, when working for HP, I had the opportunity to take Stanford graduate courses.  The quality of the teaching was mind-boggling.  How lucky these guys are, I kept thinking.  Such opportunity!<p>Of course I jumped at the chance of taking the first AI class, eager to see if it would go towards the (possibly hugely profitable) world-wide higher education framework I was hoping we'd manage to build.  I was disappointed by the certificate at the end only mentioning Stanford to make sure that we didn't think this was associated with them in any way.  They were clearly not getting it.<p>But Sebastian Thrun was, and I think Anant Agarwal at MIT is as well.  The extremely high teaching standards they have already shown: add a way to give trusted certificates, and this could be the way out for millions of kids throughout the world.

What I heard the judge saying is basically this (and something judges have repeatedly said):  <i>Copyright is not a barrier to competition with functionally equivalent products, nor is it a barrier to interoperability of functional software.</i>  WINE is not a derivative work of Windows, for example....<p>Instead copyright (at least in the US) only protects creative expression to the extent it can be separated from function.  This means it protects source code in kind of funny ways and with strange boundaries which haven't been as fleshed out as much as one might think.  This is important.<p>It places a lot of the more extremist rhetoric about what the GPL prohibits in doubt too, since by this logic steps that are minimally necessary to interop with a piece of software can never, by themselves, rise to the level of copyright infringement.",1338628124

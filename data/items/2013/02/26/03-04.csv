5283846,comment,5281536,5281536,2,0,codex,,,"If you're clever, you can do this kind of postprocessing without a big CPU hit on mobile phones.  Phones compress video in hardware, and as part of that process the hardware looks for blocks of video that are roughly the same across frames.  When it finds one, it attaches a pointer indicating where it should go in the next frame.<p>Taken in aggregate, all of these pointers in the compressed data stream effectively show you which way the image ""shook"" relative to the previous image (and how far it shook) saving you CPU cycles to  determine this yourself.  You can even detect rotation.  So all you need to do now is compensate for the shake by rewriting the compressed stream, ""panning"" (and perhaps rotating) in the opposite direction of the shake.  In order to have room to pan, you need to emit a smaller rectangle than the original video.<p>This isn't sufficient for advanced stabilization, but it's a quick first pass.<p>I took a stab at writing this for the iPhone in 2010, but by that time the writing was clearly on the wall: Apple was soon going to offer this functionality in hardware (and they do, on the iPhone 4S and 5), and they would only do a better job with every phone refresh.  The only way one can hope to compete is to perform global optimizations across the entire video clip that the hardware encoder can't do (e.g. dynamic programming), or else apply fancier transforms which are so CPU intense they kill the mobile experience.  Good job on the part of the developers; the video looks great.  As iPhone GPUs get more powerful stabilization algorithms will only get better.<p>One business angle here is to give the app. away for free and charge a dollar per video to deshake clips as a web service in the cloud.",1361850952

Thrasymachus (the Sophist) gives his understanding of justice and injustice as ""justice is what is advantageous to the stronger, while injustice is to one's own profit and advantage"".

Client-side MVC frameworks like Ember and Backbone have absolutely no effect on the appearance of your application at all.<p><i>>> Weve spend a lot of time getting Backbone to work properly, and the ease-of-use quickly deteriorates when your models get more complex</i><p>Backbone is imperfect, but this is hardly a point against client-side MVC as a whole.<p><i>>> What you end up with is building a layer cake that doesnt add any value and slows down development. Especially when youre starting out and need to stay flexible you dont want to have too much code aroundand Rails is great for that, but adding a JSON API layer and basically a second application that runs on the client is annihilating this advantage for you.</i><p>This, I think, is his strongest point. There certainly is extra code you need to write for applications that rely heavily on front-end code. But, on the flip side, there are advantages, too. For example, you tend to have a significantly snappier user interface without having to resort to complex and error-prone nested caching schemes. There's also the beneficial side-effect that you'll end up testing your JSON API very robustly.<p>At the end of the day, the ""correct"" answer is likely the boring one: the pattern you should use depends heavily on personal constraints such as who you are, what you're familiar with, and what you're building.",1361850896

I honestly have a hugely hard time identifying with people that have only grown up in a city and have NO idea where food comes from.<p>I find it excruciatingly odd people hate on large scale cow lots, but seemingly find the mass murder of small animals that live in the same place as grains to be ""meh"". More rabbits and other cuddly creatures die from combines than all of the evil things we do to cows in feed lots.<p>I've had to help out cows after they've prolapsed, and also had to help out other cows that have fought each other to near death, animals are not disney cartoons. But I've dated vegetarians and vegans (no offense to anyone there) that seem to have this unnatural viewpoint of our use of animals as food.<p>I see cartoon cows and can't help but think its similar to lolcats. So far removed from reality that we've anthropomorphized things to the point of ridiculousness. I'll be a bit blunt, after living around cows for 18 years of my life, I really don't have much sympathy for them. They're just as evil as humans are to each other, and they are such herd creatures it isn't funny. The bulls however always seemed to be less skittish, the females, they never acted even remotely rational or consistent. Bring calves into the picture and throw even that out the window. The bulls just fought and wanted to get into the females areas.<p>Just to counter your city experience a bit, not trying to say feed lots are a good way to mass produce meat, but I grew up not dealing with any of that. I have zero qualms eating a cow or chicken, but free range is loads better to eat than mass produced. I just see them as no different than wheat or other plants to be honest.",1361850634

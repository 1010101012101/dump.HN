Its true, as others advise, that some times you have to push your self to get to the next level or reach that important goal.  But it is also true that such periods of effort and focus should not feel like drudgery.  In my experience, if I like what I am doing that effort is work but not drudgery. When I start to feel drudgery creeping into my work life I know that is a sign to examine what am I doing and why.

2326583,comment,2325588,2325855,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Hmm. What do you envision a ""meltdown"" to consist of? The system still has a fallback system in the event of a core meltdown that is designed to cool and manage the core without radiation release. Meltdown definitely does not equal to ""release of them into the atmosphere"".<p>I'm not overly familiar with this specific reactor design; but usually what happens is they seal the containment as the core melts, flooding the sump (where the slag would collect) with water to cool it down.<p>Right now they are trying to avoid that <i>because</i> a) there is always a risk of radiation leak from the containment and b) because the cleanup bill would catch quite a few more zeroes. The point is; meltdown is the final failure scenario, if they get to it, well, they get to it. But there is no fallback if something goes wrong at that point; so it is potentially better to try and control it at this stage, while you still have a fallback to implement.<p>Please don't be overly dramatic (""and you'd be condemning the US Western Coast to dangerous levels of radiation""); this is a bad situation. But at the moment there does not appear to be a major risk to the US Western Coast. As you say, best not to comment in too much depth if you don't know the details.",1300178555

(Dealing with other people's horrible code, the build process, deployment, etc., can also be ""exciting,"" but they aren't sexy.) When there's nothing challenging you and everything's just running smoothly, it's just really straightforward, simple stuff that will put you to sleep, and the downfall of a lot of programmers is to try to make it more exciting than necessary(amazing new architectures, savage optimization, burying everything in tests/types/patterns blindly).<p>So the key to learning, I think, is not just to ""start small and work your way up,"" but to try to make the small projects exciting, and gradually build up to the big and boring ones, but always striving for some occasional challenges along the way.<p>I did bits of programming, off and on, from an early age, but did not have a major breakthrough until college, and still did not consider myself a ""programmer"" until fairly recently. The breakthrough came from getting a good formal treatment of CS topics(particularly data structures) in a lecture setting. I needed that to see the possibilities.",1300178183

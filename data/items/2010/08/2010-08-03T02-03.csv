I'd love to take a look and see how you solves this empty canvas problem.<p>I was thinking about building a wizard to force people into populating their settings, but on the other hand, I want to let users use Marrily at their own pace, instead of stopping them at a lengthy sign up/setup process.  I ended up with just one screen to let users create a new default event at the beginning.  I guess it's about balancing the flow so that users can feel that they are engaging and not being forced to do certain things to get started.<p>I wonder if there's title for a ""web application director"", or a ""web site editor"" like in film to direct how the app would feel like, not just the UI is working, but the whole site can work cohesively and have the right the flow to it.  A UX person maybe?",1280804332

1569881,comment,1567595,1567822,0,0,pedanticfreak,,,"I have not worked on mainframes per se. But I was once tasked with investigating why a particular project to replace a mainframe process with a modern Java one failed.<p>Basically, the mainframe is FAST. Everything is simple there. The process in question was more or less a COBOL stored procedure doing a bunch of lookups in an incredibly denormalized DB2 database. The entire batch job would take less than 15 minutes on the mainframe of which this particular process was only a small fraction.<p>Now, the Java app to replace the mainframe process was apparently written by some smart dudes that had gone on to make lots of cash doing more exciting things by the time I got there. The replacement system was what lots of naive people drinking the Hibernate Kool-Aide were writing back then. The database was normalized to the extreme, it had a hierarchical object model that was mapped to objects with Hibernate, had a slick web interface, and so on. Well it ran like balls. It got exponentially slower as data was added. The administrative interface took 30 minutes to save a setting. This new process would increase the runtime of the overall batch by an estimated 10 hours. So I looked at it, and with another guy cleaned up a bunch of bad SQL and Hibernate.<p>The administrative interface got shaved down to seconds for a post. But in the end the overhead alone of marshaling and unmarshaling XML for the service calls was enough to push the batch process a full two hours longer than the mainframe one. Which, by the way, was unacceptably long for the 1 hour maximum processing window allotted to the batch.<p>OK, I know what you're saying. That's when you bring in the cloud and run a bunch of parallel instances and such and such. Or dump XML and use some kind of raw binary message format. But shit. The mainframe already did all that with a single threaded COBOL stored procedure in under 15 minutes. Needless to say, today they're still using that same old COBOL stored procedure and they're still making money hand over fist.<p>So yeah. Big companies spend lots of money trying to get off the mainframe every year. Believe me, I have personally witnessed tens of millions of USD lost to failed mainframe replacement projects by developers who think they know better. It's not like some manager looked at the the estimate and said ""hell no."" Actually they said, ""Hell yes! My top architects say the mainframe is dead. I will write a check for $50 million dollars right now because that is nothing compared to the $10 billion in revenue we make."" It's just not as easy as it looks.",1280802293

What most people have come to know as ""Linux"" or ""GNU/Linux"" is a kernel mashed together with the GNU userland. And most distributions then further pile things onto it, kind of assuming they know what kinds of things the end-user will want to do, and picking a few applications that will help the end-user accomplish those tasks. Maybe it's Gnome, OpenOffice, Firefox and Pidgin.<p>The BSDs provide a system. The kernel and userland are maintained and enhanced by the same group of people. There's a bit more control in what's provided in the base system.<p>After installing Free/Net/OpenBSD Users are generally left with a text-mode login console where a small subset of non-BSD-based things are installed but often not active. X.Org may be ready to go, as may Apache, lynx and some others.  In the case of OpenBSD, these tools are often patched considerably before packaged with the base OS.<p>Want something other than twm for your Window Manager? Want a graphical web browser? An office productivity suite? You can install them easily via binary packages, or use the ports system.<p>If you've used Gentoo or Arch Linux, you will probably find that the ports system (/usr/ports/* if you installed it) is familiar.<p>I use OpenBSD quite a bit, even on the desktop. It's fast, free, and very robust. It's also probably the most strictly audited operating system code base in existence. Those guys (like me) are pedantic when it comes to security.<p>I highly suggest you fire up one of them (OpenBSD or FreeBSD, I'd suggest) in a VM and give it a shot. VirtualBox is free. NetBSD is primarily geared toward maximum portability between hardware platforms. I personally think that's the only thing it's got over OpenBSD.<p>I used to be a FreeBSD fan before 5.x. The team had a really rough time after Jordan left for Apple. I became disenchanted and haven't really given it the time of day for almost a decade now. It's probably a fine OS.",1280801716

Take your $2 million and buy four $500K houses (or eight $250K houses, or whatever's appropriate). Pay an agent to take care of them, or do it yourself, depending on how much involvement you want. That should yield maybe $8,000 a month in rent, which after you've taken care of all the extra costs should still be enough to live on quite comfortably. Any capital gains you enjoy (and if you're smart you'll have invested in an up-and-coming area) are a bonus.<p>The best part is that you don't need to leave some money on the table to hedge against inflation, since in the long term rent will pretty much keep pace with inflation.<p>There are areas where this is a completely terrible idea due to rent controls and other landlord-unfriendly policies, obviously you shouldn't do it there.

    payment form below (IRS FORM P).
  Submit this form and any necessary payments by April 15. Forms received

  ""Total individual income"" includes wages, salaries, tips, revenue from
    sale of capital assets, stock dividends, and inheritance of cash assets.
    It does not include acquisition of non-cash assets including real or
    personal property, securities, or other capital assets. However, any
    sale or liquidation of non-cash assets may then become subject to
    income tax. In general, one-time transactions of less than $1,000
    may be omitted. Detailed rules are available in IRS DOCUMENT I,
    available at http://www.irs.gov/documents/i/ or at your local library
    or post office.
    For any recurring transactions, or one-time transactions of $1,000
    or above, IRS Form R or O should have already been submitted to the
    IRS. We have enclosed copies of those forms in this mailing. If any
    of these forms are in error, file a copy of IRS FORM C to appeal
    for a correction.

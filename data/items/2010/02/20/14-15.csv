But tangential features do affect each other (i.e. you cannot succeed without good engineering). His point was that a better engineering will give you a slight better chance to succeed (tangential), but that it's so small that's almost imperceptible and can seem to not affect (orthogonal).",1266677929

If you're in the Anxiety area it means that you're under-skilled and over-challenged for the task in question.<p>A little bit of anxiety might not be bad though. As your skills improve then you might pass in to the Arousal phase. But also as your skills improve the challenge is decreased (gravitate towards the middle). Eventually you might become over-skilled at the task and the challenge becomes low, then you're Relaxed.",1266677620

The climate we have seems pretty good; overall, the world is comfortable and productive. So why risk changing it by pumping unprecedented amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere? Looking at the problem objectively, it seems like our current course of action is the most radical one. Contrary to your suggestion, we ARE acting radically in the face of uncertainty. And it's not even a 50/50 proposition: we are acting radically in the blind hope that the LESS probable outcome will happen.<p>In this case, those urging CO2 curbs are the conservatives, and those pushing to produce more CO2 are the radicals.",1266676885

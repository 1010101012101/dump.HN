47037,comment,46766,46766,0,0,brlewis,,,"The article seems to imply Google has backed off from ad targeting.  I don't think so.  An email I got about the death of someone's mother caused gmail to put an ad in the sidebar about grief counseling in his city.<p>People accept google's targeted ads because the info isn't passed back to advertisers; the system shows a relevant ad based on text and then (as far as I know) forgets it.  If Facebook eventually works the same way, I think objections will subside.

47034,comment,46735,46945,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Haha, well, more startup relevant than, say, a history lesson by a guy who flaunts vocabulary like salaryman while glossing over modern history and comparing big Japanese corporations of zaibatsu background to China, who is still a new player but already plenty strong.<p>Yeah, the article is about Japan's comeback and not China, but if you want to talk about Japan's comeback it didn't just start with interest rates. There are a slew of other things people have been talking about and claiming to be the signal of Japan's comeback. Interest rates were discussed on magazines around half a year ago. And how in the world can you miss Toyota in that list? They're in the forefront of the comeback.<p>So I thought ""make way for Japan"" was about something other than the Japanese excelling in ""traditional industries."" Everybody knows what the Japanese are good at. Nothing surprises. The title led me to think Japan has grown startup clusters. That would be a big, big deal.",1188232953

47026,comment,46897,47011,0,0,jey,,,"This is a good, but flawed argument. Intelligence is fundamentally an <i>information processing</i> function. [Simplistically,] your brain receives bits of information from its sensory inputs, crunches on them, and outputs some bits of information. It also stores some bits, to create what we call memory.<p>The bits don't care if they're processed in a silicon-based computer or a meat-based computer. The computations and transformations are what matter. Again, this ""simulations aren't wet"" is relying on a hidden assumption of a false distinction created by Searle.  He distinguishes between the ""real thinking"" and ""fake thinking"", then with that assumption in hand, creates an example in which the ""real"" vs ""fake"" distinction is clear.<p>Here's the real question:
  When you run a simulation of a Turing machine, does any computation happen?<p>The answer is obviously ""yes"".<p>NOTE: I mean ""information"" here in the sense of Claude Shannon's Information Theory. I'm not saying that literal 1 and 0 bits like in a computer are used by the human brain. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory</a><p>
And I'm really curious: what, in general terms, is so special about brains? Do they contain souls? Do they tap into some mystical forces of Consciousness as in Cartesian dualism? As far as I'm aware, brains are intelligent systems built out of matter. So let's figure out how to build intelligent systems out of matter, and build one.",1188232220

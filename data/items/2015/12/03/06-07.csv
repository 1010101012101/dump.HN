10668160,comment,10662461,10668125,0,0,pcwalton,,,"> I would also say that although I might lose some performance advantages with a functional approach, the improvement to system comprehension means better human optimization of distributed multi-core contexts.<p>You don&#x27;t even need to bring in parallelism for functional approaches to gain in performance. Here&#x27;s an example (in Rust) of how you&#x27;d implement collecting an iterator into a vector using the &quot;machine simple&quot; approach:<p><pre><code>    let mut array = vec![];\n    for element in some_iterator {\n        array.push(element);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nNow for the functional, less &quot;machine simple&quot; approach:<p><pre><code>    let array = some_iterator.collect();\n</code></pre>\nWhich is faster? Without knowing the details of the compiler, you might think the former is faster, because there are fewer function calls and less indirection. But this is wrong, as the compiler will trivially inline &quot;collect&quot; for you and eliminate any indirection.<p>In fact, it turns out that the second approach is often <i>significantly</i> faster, because the standard library contains the equivalent of:<p><pre><code>    let mut array = Vec::with_capacity(some_iterator.size_hint());\n    for element in some_iterator {\n        array.push(element);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThat is, it uses the size_hint() method to avoid reallocating during the collection operation, reducing the number of memory allocation and array copy operations to O(1) instead of O(log n).<p>What are the chances that you&#x27;d do this important optimization manually? Not high: it adds noise, it&#x27;s esoteric, and it&#x27;s easy to forget. But if you use the functional idiom, you benefit from the optimized approach every time. <i>That</i> is the true benefit of abstraction, which is really the key point here. &quot;Machine simple&quot; and &quot;fast&quot; are frequently in <i>opposition</i>, and too often people think that the former implies the latter.",1449125181

My favorite part was when Milburn decided that he would supervise their coding via video chat<p>> Gregory suggested it might be more productive if we all got to work, and Milburn agreed, but he insisted that we work while logged into a video chat with him. So we went to our desks and we started working, and all of us (except Hinton) were logged into video chat with Milburn. And Milburn just sort of stared at us through the screen. He wanted to overhear us, and he wanted to watch us as we worked. His attitude was like that of a foreman who was overseeing a crew that had to dig a ditch. It was as if he feared that we would only work while he was looking at us, and the moment he looked away we would goof off.<p>...<p>> I said, “It is definitely in the hashmap.”<p>> Milburn jumped in. “What is this?

10668153,comment,10644987,10659795,0,0,lmmi,,,"What you&#x27;re looking for is in Figure 3 (admittedly a bit hard to read because I had to squish it into the paper).  Each panel in that figure shows the results for test suites of a fixed size.  For example, the top left panel shows the results for suites with three test cases for Apache POI.  If you draw a horizontal line through the graph, all of the test suites that fall on that line have the same effectiveness score even though they have different coverage levels.  I gave a talk about this paper at GTAC this year and Google posts all the videos on YouTube, so if you have time and you&#x27;re still curious the explanation in the talk might help (and the graphs are much easier to read).  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAfROROGujU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAfROROGujU</a><p>The normalization was a point of contention with the peer reviewers as well, so in the end I tried both the normalized and unnormalized metrics and found similar results with both.  The other tables and figures are available on my site if you want to look at them.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I understand what you mean when you say suite B is doing more with less, though.  In the example, I was trying to say that suite B covers more code, so it will kill more mutants.  Maybe suite A kills 20 mutants and suite B kills 25 mutants, just to have some numbers to talk about.  But if B covers 50 mutants, and is only killing 25 of them, while A covers 25 mutants and kills 20 of the 25, it seems like suite A is doing a better job of testing the code it covers.  Or to put it another way, suite B is broad but shallow while suite A is focused but deep.  B isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad suite, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s doing more with less, just that it has a different focus.  Maybe I&#x27;m misunderstanding your point, though.<p>Another way of thinking about it is that the raw mutation score measures breadth: B is better than A because 25 > 20.  The normalized score measures depth: A is better than B because 80% (20/25) > 50% (25/50).",1449125051

I argued that what&#x27;s going on with the police is that they&#x27;re used by the higher classes as a tool of defense/oppression against the lower ones. I don&#x27;t think race is of any direct relevance to this phenomenon.<p>You argued (as I understand things) that the motivation for forming the police was usually &quot;racist&quot;, and that it made more sense to view the depredations of police as race issue than a class issue.<p>I counter that in a society of several racial groups, some poor and some wealthy, I think the police would be expected to spend their energies on the poor groups while leaving the wealthy ones alone. To me, this is evidence that the police are a social-class based instrument rather than a race-based instrument, because if they were an expression of racism they&#x27;d be expected to spend their energies on aliens while leaving natives alone (in this analysis, Jews who have been resident for centuries but maintain their own separate culture are &quot;aliens&quot;, not &quot;natives&quot;).<p>You say that the different treatment of racial groups according to what social class they belong to is just more racism. You can call it that, but the label stops being useful -- if the police are a &quot;racist&quot; institution, by this definition, you can&#x27;t predict anything about how they&#x27;ll treat someone even knowing the race of that person, or knowing whether their race differs from the race of the police they&#x27;re interacting with, or whether it differs from the race of the group running the police, or any such thing. You have to know their race and the position their race occupies in society. But the social position is doing all the work -- your predictions will be nearly as good if all you know is the personal social standing of the person interacting with the police. Race is a sideshow.<p>Why is treating different races differently <i>because they have very different social standing</i> primarily an issue of race rather than social standing?",1449124802

Zippers?).<p>There are &quot;Real World&quot; Haskell resources, in fact there is even a book named Real World Haskell[0], though I recommend Haskell Book[1] these days since it takes an approach of teaching from first principles.<p>0: <a href=""http://book.realworldhaskell.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://book.realworldhaskell.org/</a><p>1: <a href=""http://haskellbook.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://haskellbook.com/</a>",1449122436

So you could use it as long as you wanted, but you had to go to their website every day to get a code to use it that day. If you used it every day, you probably got sick of going to the website and just purchased it.",1449122424

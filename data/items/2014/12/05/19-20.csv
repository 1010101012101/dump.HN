8706512,comment,8704303,8706178,0,0,themodelplumber,,,"I&#x27;m almost 20 years into a successful, solo freelancing career. GP&#x27;s advice is worth researching.<p>You might not be missing anything by sticking to hourly billing if you are aiming at a downmarket clientele. They usually appreciate hourly billing because they are either making nice margins off of your work (by reselling or by quality derived) or undercharging for their own work. Hourly billing is comfortable for them because they are usually extremely price-sensitive. This works OK for a lot of new freelancers, who themselves are also very price-sensitive.<p>The upside of only doing hourly billing is steady work. The downside is that you may never understand what upmarket work is like.<p>If you are aiming at upmarket clientele (or just clientele who are upmarket from your current set of clients), you have to adapt to a different mindset--quality, specialty, and responsiveness are key; pricing is used as a toolset that supports your business goal of offering those three things. Pricing becomes a group of activities that act as a market positioning message, negotiating tool, sales pitch, etc. All of that from a little dollar sign with a number after it (or a set of them).<p>If you are not aiming at any market, you might be headed downmarket. Good idea to check on that. Most freelancers do the same amount of pricing research as the average lemonade stand. Many freelancers who go out of business have authored their own personal failure narrative that revolves around an uneducated view on pricing.",1417809455

I can touch both terminals of my car&#x27;s battery with my hands and very little happens.  That&#x27;s because V = I * R, V = 12 and R ~= 100k so I = 0.12 milliamps or 120 microamps.<p>Now of course we&#x27;re talking about 48V not 12V but that&#x27;s still less than half a milliamp, unless of course you have both of your hands drenched in saltwater and you grab as much exposed wire as you can, in which case the body&#x27;s resistance is going to be much less than 100k.  But for any reasonable adult it&#x27;s fairly difficult to kill yourself with 48V.<p>Will people still need to be careful?  Absolutely.  But the idea is that at least at first, it&#x27;s much easier to get around codes requiring permits and inspections and whatnot that make it much harder for individuals to do without explicit approval of the government (know how to file a permit?  great.  are you a certified electrician?  sorry...).  Given that in many places the government owns, regulates or otherwise has a substantial interest in the electrical utility company this at least temporarily would allow people to do this on their own.

8706498,comment,8704659,8704659,0,0,shortcircuit01,,,"There is a big advantage to node.js that used to be mentioned a lot in its early days, but not much now.  The advantage is still there, but it&#x27;s only noticeable if a developer has experience in other server languages.  The big advantage is that node.js had an asynchronous development model from the beginning.  This caused all the code written since then to also be written using async.  When a node.js project imports other libraries through npm, there is no need to worry about some random synchronous code blocking.  All code is written using async because that&#x27;s the way it was enforced from the beginning.<p>This is an advantage it shares with other new languages like Go that had good concurrency support from the start.  Go has the same advantage with goroutines.  All code written by the community since then uses goroutines.<p>Compare this to python and java which had better concurrency bolted on long after those languages were released.  Twisted is basically node.js for python and it existed for a long time before node.js.  But one of the main problems with Twisted is that all other existing python code is not written in an async way.  A python dev could use Twisted, but as soon as they get some useful library form PIP, it&#x27;s probably going to block and ruin the whole async.<p>Java has a similar issue.  It was released with heavy threads as the only way to handle concurrency.  There have been attempts to try to bolt on async and lightweight thread models.  But there is a massive existing ecosystem of java code.  None of that will work well with async and no one can rewrite all of it to use some new lightweight thread model.<p>This is the advantage of a fresh start like node.js or Go.  Wheels will be reinvented, but it will have improvements that can&#x27;t just be bolted on later.<p>The biggest flaw with node.js right now is that it came too early.  If it came out with ES6, it would be a much better ecosystem.  If generators/yield had existed from the start, all the callback mess could&#x27;ve been avoided.  However, although the callbacks were an unavoidable mess, it did fundamentally force async on the ecosystem.  NPM libraries like co show a migration path to the generators/yield future for older node.js code.  The IO.js fork should use this opportunity to put something like the co library into core and push generators/yield as the way forward.  If Joyent was the cause of the delayed generators/yield support, then they have done great damage to the node.js ecosystem.  Node.js should&#x27;ve heavily promoted generator/yield use as soon as it was in V8, not hide it behind a --harmony flag for over a year.",1417809284

8706495,comment,8705426,8706189,0,0,api,,,"That is the standard conservative incrementalist position about systems. I think it&#x27;s a denial of the efficacy of conceptual thought.<p>It often stems from an analogy to biological evolution, but evolution is a geological-timescale process that occurs over aeons. To use it as a guide to cultural, social, and engineering progress is the naturalistic fallacy not to mention a bit of a category error.<p>That being said -- I do consider the challenging of the &quot;crappy old OS + virtualization&quot; paradigm unlikely due to the lack of a strong financial incentive to do the work. The amount of work required is <i>waaaaay</i> beyond amateur open source hacker thresholds.<p>It&#x27;s possible that this lack of a financial incentive betrays a lack of overall value incentive. Maybe containerization + virtualization, while ugly and ham-fisted, is &quot;good enough&quot; and a more elegant approach just wouldn&#x27;t have enough &quot;win&quot; to it. A similar situation exists with languages like D, Go, and Rust vs C++. They&#x27;re better, but they&#x27;re probably not better enough to displace the incumbent. Peter Thiel&#x27;s rule on competition (from the incredible book Zero to One) is that an upstart alternative usually has to be 10X better to &quot;disrupt&quot; an established market. I can&#x27;t imagine a polished-up Plan9-ish OS being 10X better than Linux+Docker+KVM on important metrics. A new OS would have to be 10X as productive to program, 10X less time consuming to admin, 10X more efficient at the use of hardware, 10X more secure, or some combination thereof that amounts to a 10X win.",1417809246

There&#x27;s more, too, where calling CharSequence.subSequence causes a memory leak because you&#x27;re pulling out a small portion (say, 10 bytes) of a large backing buffer (say, 1MB), and storing it in a persistent object prevents the GC from collecting the buffer, since a portion of its data is still live.  This has caused real memory leaks in Google servers, enough that they had to educate the whole developer base about the pitfalls of it.  But I figured I had enough to pick on with Java&#x27;s broken Unicode handling to illustrate the grandparent&#x27;s point: strings are hard.

It might help us to better assess how to help you in the short term. As it is, I can only speak in generalities.<p>There is a level of insecurity to going it on your own that you need to embrace, to put it bluntly. Obviously if you quit your job and found office space then you have started down this path of embracing insecurity, but you haven&#x27;t embraced it enough. You have thought of a few ideas and then knocked them all down because you are a sensible guy. You can see how they will fail, why your dream (which seems to be just &quot;entrepreneurship&quot;, maybe) won&#x27;t come to fruition, and how you will have to start over again, or whatnot. That&#x27;s a tough spot, I have always started new ventures with my product idea in mind beforehand. But whether you come up with the product idea beforehand or in the middle of the process, you have to embrace the idea that you are likely going to hit hundreds of roadblocks and issues, and you will most likely fail. That&#x27;s no big deal! That&#x27;s part of the fun.<p>Another problem you seem to have is, despite the few ideas and potential revenue models, you aren&#x27;t solving a problem you actually have. If you were, you wouldn&#x27;t be worried about the potential problems with hypothetical development paths. You would be fixing a problem, a problem you have and understand, and one you need a solution to right now. Solving a problem you have also answers the question of how revolutionary your solution is. If you hate how the rest of the world distributes widgets, and you need widgets, and you come up with a better way to distribute widgets, is this not revolutionary? Maybe &quot;widgets&quot; in this case are men&#x27;s shaving razor blades. I don&#x27;t think that razor blades are all that interesting, and certainly aren&#x27;t that revolutionary. But Michael Dubin had a problem, thought up a solution that was better than what everyone else was doing, and &quot;revolutionized&quot; the men&#x27;s razor blade industry. In reality he made it easier to buy blades online; his model can be described on a cocktail napkin with room to spare. But he did something revolutionary. He seems pretty happy.<p>What problem do you have, regularly, that you hate? If you have no problems, what problem does your significant other have? Your best friend? Your dog? Your local municipality? Stop thinking about development paths and revenue models; those will come in time. Find something you can get behind and care about. Something where, when it doesn&#x27;t work out, you won&#x27;t care about how much money you didn&#x27;t make, you&#x27;ll only care that the problem isn&#x27;t solved! The voice in your head that says &quot;just take one of the ideas and execute on it, don&#x27;t worry about the outcome&quot; is totally right! But first, find an idea you care enough about that the outcome doesn&#x27;t really matter.<p>On an unrelated tangent, think long and hard whether you want to learn an entirely new development ecosystem while you are trying to solve your problem. C# and .Net are good. So is Python. Do you want to build the solution to your problem, or do you want to learn a new language?",1417808784

Ever since then, I wished I dug into this deeper with you as it&#x27;s been an open thread at the back of my mind. Even though this may not be the right place for it, I&#x27;m going to go ahead and respond point by point.<p>* It forces you to negotiate with clients in the worst possible numeric domain: where small deltas to proposed rates disproportionately impact the final cost.\n(This is a really good point and something that I will consider moving forard. I can see that higher effective rates may appear more palatable to clients if quoted on a per day or per week basis.)<p>I&#x27;ve categorized my feelings about the rest of your points:<p>The [HOW DOES BILLING HOURLY DO THIS] points:<p>* It positions you against the lowest-quality cheapest providers.\n(I charge a very high hourly rate, clients are happy to pay it.)<p>* It misaligns your incentives, so that you&#x27;re penalized for doing a better job.\n(The times I accomplish a difficult task very efficiently are averaged with the times what appears to be a mundane task turns out taking much longer.)<p>* Not to mention: it generates more invoices.\n(I bill bi-weekly. I imagine I&#x27;d want to do the same no matter what unit I was using.)<p>* For that matter, it inclines your projects towards the small and away from anything ambitious.\n(Huh? What&#x27;s wrong with &quot;I expect this project will take 4 months of me working at 30/hrs a week and this hourly rate&quot;?)<p>* It impedes your own flexibility, so that you tend to miss opportunities to interleave projects or for that matter take an occasional long lunch.\n(I typically tell clients that I&#x27;ll put in 3hrs of work/day on their projects. It seems like my billing gives way MORE flexibility, not less.)<p>* It forces you to account for every waking hour of your day in a way that daily rates don&#x27;t, when we all know that only a small subset of your work hours are truly productive.\n(See previous point: I&#x27;m never of the hook to provide a &quot;full day&quot;. Some days I work more, some less.)<p>The [HAVING AN OPEN AN HONEST DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND WHAT EXPECTATIONS ARE APPROPRIATE AND WHY I FEEL UTTER TRANSPARENCY IS KEY FOR MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING] points:<p>* It totally hides the cost of ramp-up and ramp-down (if you think clients push back on daily or project rates, wait until you charge them for 2 hours of &quot;getting in flow&quot;). (My clients do not push back on this because I explain how very necessary this type of work is up front.)<p>* It conditions your customers to take a fine-tooth-comb approach to project plans and invoices. (If they&#x27;re fine-toothing, that&#x27;s fine. I can&#x27;t really tell, it doesn&#x27;t affect me. I&#x27;ve had a single client ask me a single time for clarification on an hourly line item in the past four years. It wasn&#x27;t a big deal.)<p>The [I ALWAYS PRECISELY TRACK TIME ON EVERY PROJECT I WORK ON BECAUSE IT HELPS ME IMPROVE AT ESTIMATING, WHICH I&#x27;M NOW EXTREMELY GOOD AT] points:<p>* It forces you to be vigilant about time tracking lest you accidentally undercharge customers.<p>* It inclines you towards finicky accounting, the kind that charges a customer for a 45 minute phone conversation.<p>The [I DON&#x27;T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN] point:<p>* Not to mention, with virtually any client worth doing business with, you (the consultant) are much more sensitive to the cost of a project than the customer is; it is a small miracle that the customer can get a programming project completed at all without potentially hiring and then firing 3 different people. So why is all the burden on you? Why is any of the burden on you? Key consulting idea: it&#x27;s not the customer&#x27;s money they&#x27;re spending.\n(What burden do you mean? The burden of tracking time? The burden of estimating?)<p>The [HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT EITHER WAY] point:<p>* It obscures the final cost of projects in ways that make clients defensive, so that their immediate thought is &quot;oh shit this is going to add up to lots of hours we better be careful&quot;.<p>The [I REALLY DON&#x27;T THINK GIVING FREEBIE TIME IS IMPORTANT FOR CLIENT RELATIONS IF YOU SET EXPECTATIONS APPROPRIATELY] point:<p>* It makes it harder for you to reasonable toss freebie work to your best clients without damaging the expected value of your time; for instance, I can cab over to a client in Chicago and spend 2 hours looking at a design with them for free without creating the appearance that my bill rate is arbitrary.\n(Why would the ability to offer free work inform the structure I put in place for billing?)<p>I hope I&#x27;m not coming off as disrespectful, I do really appreciate the time and care you put into HN.

I would have to explain that I was trying to tie up a minuscule patch in a larger gantt chart, the nature of project management, the way I was looking to build long-term relationships (usually completely under-appreciated), etc.<p>In one case I offered to pay a premium to a developer for his domain expertise, only for him to loop around and use our project discussions as an evangelism platform for his software of choice. Almost every one of his replies started with &quot;No problem,&quot; had the software name in the middle, and ended with &quot;makes this extremely simple.&quot; At the end of the project he gave me a gigantic discount because I was now &quot;part of the community.&quot; Needless to say, I found the didactic nature of his communications extremely difficult and we never worked together after that.<p>Back in development mode (as opposed to project management mode) I can understand what was happening. I&#x27;ve landed new clients because they noticed my community contributions and saw that I was geographically close to them. And whenever someone says, &quot;we just don&#x27;t have time to do this ourselves&quot; I can now offer 100% of my empathy. Still, I&#x27;m surrounded by community members who type up massive tutorials within an hour, or build a completed demo project that does 80% of what the requester needs, and then disappear when the requester asks for just a bit more, or heaven forbid, offers money.",1417808460

8706420,comment,8704318,8704318,0,0,userbinator,,,"<i>25000 (!!) allocations are made for every keystroke in the Omnibox.</i><p>The Omnibox is no doubt far more complex than simple text box since entering characters into it can invoke things like network connections (for search suggestions), but 25k allocs is still a bit on the excessive side.<p>Strings are an interesting case in that in general they are of indeterminate (and variable) length, which makes them somewhat difficult to accommodate in computer memory which is finite and allocated in fixed-length pieces. Abstractions like std::string have been created to make it simpler and easier to perform operations like appending, resizing, copying, and concenating, but I think this is part of the problem: by making these operations so easy and simple for the programmer, they&#x27;re more inclined to <i>overuse</i> them instead of asking questions like &quot;do I really need to create a copy just to modify one character? do I really need to append to this string? how long can it be?&quot; Essentially, the abstraction encourages ignorance of the real nature of the actual operations, leading to more inefficient code. It only helps the programmer to perform these tedious operations more easily, and doesn&#x27;t help at all with the decision of whether such tedious operations should be needed at all, which I think is more important; the first question when designing shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;what abstractions should I use to do X?&quot;, but &quot;do I really need to do X, or is there are simpler way that doesn&#x27;t need to?&quot; The most efficient way to do something is to not do it at all.<p>Contrast this with a language like C, in which string operations are (unless the programmer writes or uses a library) far more explicit, and the programmer can be more aware of what his/her code is actually doing. That&#x27;s why I believe every programmer who has to deal with strings should have at one point been exposed to implementing a resizable string buffer and/or length-delimited string library, to see the real nature of the problem (including how to do length management correctly.) Without this basic, low-level understanding of how to use memory, the advantages of all the other fancy string abstractions won&#x27;t make much sense either.",1417808368

I haven&#x27;t done much frontend programming, but am about to undertake a medium sized project architected as a single page webapp. So my perspeftive in evaluating these frameworks is one of a fairly experienced non-frontend programmer. I can learn one easily, it&#x27;s just a question of which I want to learn.<p>I looked at Angular and I really like the composability of directives. It seems like frontend frameworks have been maturing along a trend of composability. First jquery was popular because it eased the pain of manipulating individual elements of the DOM, then backbone was (and still is) popular because it introduced reactive components at a time when server side JS was growing in popularity, so it was a natural fit. Recently, angular grew in popularity for the same reactive advantages. There&#x27;s something really attractive about the idea of cleanly separated code for each physical element/region on a page. That&#x27;s why people liked directives, and angular was definitely onto something.<p>However, it seems like React accomplishes all of the same feats as angular, and offers the same advantages, but does it in a much cleaner fashion. JSX is far more intuitive than the Angular directive syntax, yet maintains all the composability advantages. It also has a natural place in a full stack arxhitecture if you choose to drink the look aid and implement a flux-like design. To me, React seems like the next step in the evolution of reactive frontend frameworks. Angular is the homo erectus to React&#x27;s homo sapiens. :)<p>If you&#x27;re starting a new project now, it seems to make far more sense to go with react over angular, especially if you&#x27;re primarily interested in the east composability patterns. Also, the momentum in developer communities is clearly trending toward React, especially with the recent changes announced for Angular, and the continually improving support of react.<p>I was also introduced to Pete Hunt, core contributor to react, a few years ago. He was smart as hell and honestly that&#x27;s enough of a reason for me to prefer React over Angular.",1417808160

Make the tag the last byte, indicate a short string by &quot;tag_byte & 0x07 != 7&quot;, and then store the length as &quot;7 - tag&quot;, reserving tag 7 for pointers.  If it&#x27;s a 7-byte string, then the tag byte itself will be 0, serving as the null terminator.  If it&#x27;s < 6 bytes, the null terminator gets stored in one of the earlier bytes.  If it&#x27;s a pointer, the pointer will be word-aligned, which on a 64-bit machine means that you can zero-out the low-order 3 bits (exactly what you need to store the tag) to extract the actual pointer.  If it&#x27;s a null string (the one case we couldn&#x27;t represent, since we use 0x07 as the tag for pointers), store it with a null first byte, which also gives compatibility with C.<p>Whether these gymnastics are worth it is debatable.

8706295,comment,8698074,8705059,0,0,agentultra,,,"> I&#x27;d expect a language to be able to do that<p>CL does do that. Those macros are defined by the specification. If they weren&#x27;t then you could write them yourself.<p>If you need special syntax to help you understand your program you have access to the reader and can dispatch special macros to transform your syntax into ordinary lisp forms. I&#x27;ve done it to implement readers for little assemblers.<p>I don&#x27;t see how the comparison to Scala is relevant. We&#x27;re talking here about what the weakness in Lisp is that macros cover up. There are only 27 primitive forms described in the CL specification that everything ultimately &quot;compiles&quot; down to. Do you think there is a form which doesn&#x27;t exist or one that is impaired which if replaced or fixed would make macros unnecessary?<p>Macros are such an intrinsic part of the language that I&#x27;m surprised to hear criticism from someone that they&#x27;re a symptom of a design problem!<p>> I&#x27;m spoiled by Java (well, the JVM), which did standardize threading cross-platform as part of the language, and I think has reaped rewards from doing so.<p>It&#x27;s really not that big of an issue. There are plenty of highly-threaded cross-platform applications written in nearly every language under the sun. CL does better than most because it can abstract, at the language level, the differences in platform implementations without touching the underlying implementation or specification.<p>I think the CL spec could have actually left more things under-specified like file systems. One ugly wart in CL is the file path specification. At the time the committee felt it was important to crystalize part of the specification dealing with the multitude of file system addressing available at the time. And a couple of decades later we find that wasn&#x27;t really necessary as few of those file systems are in use today... yet a conforming implementation must provide this API. Terrible.<p>On the other side of the coin it was decided by the JVM designers that TCO wasn&#x27;t necessary. Today they are wringing their hands trying to get it into the next release. The ANSI CL specification doesn&#x27;t require implementations to implement TCO and yet most do without harm to anyone&#x27;s code. The JVM decided the right level of abstraction was bytecode and now they have to be super careful not to break the world whenever they make a change. Lisp chose the language to abstract upon... which makes sense since it&#x27;s a symbolic processing language (list processing, i believe, is a misnomer and an artifact of history).<p>They didn&#x27;t specify a threading API and we have much more flexibility today than if they had settled on one.<p>What remains astounding to me is the quality of machine code some of the open source implementations can produce. SBCL is a wonderful compiler. CCL is also really good.",1417806989

You don&#x27;t typically deal with things on the package level, but on the file server level - which is inherently versioned, archivable and introspectable through simple tools. You can do things like immediately swap in a library from the file system cache just to test a program to see if it runs on it, then replace it back, all trivially.<p>There have been some bolted on approaches to package management as of more recent [1] [2]. Conceptually, they&#x27;re no more advanced than Slackware&#x27;s shell script-based pkgtools, largely because they don&#x27;t need to be.<p>A Plan 9-ish way to package management would probably involve something like mounting a networked file system to a local share and then maintaining a replica on it. Actual management could then be done through simple mkfiles. A layer on top of that which precompiles and simply union mounts the contents of an archive is certainly possible, too. It&#x27;s still pretty similar to ports, though, but with less headaches.<p>Ironically, your ideal form of package management is pretty similar to Slax&#x27;s use of union mounting compressed file system archives, or even Slackware&#x27;s tarballs that hold directory contents which are unpacked to install.

(Which certainly stretches the meaning of the term.)<p>What I&#x27;m saying is that it is not quite fair to assume that every &#x27;freelance programmer&#x27; (OP or your readers) can do that to the extent that you can.  Business requirements analysis is simply a different skill from programming.<p>Consider the example where the person buying your services is on to your pricing strategy, and misrepresents the value of the business downward (or hides it from you), so that you are left only with the process but no good idea of the value of it.<p>Can you still do your business analysis, and price it as you suggest?  Not nearly as well.  Even though as far as code goes, you could still write all of it.<p>So I would say that what you advocate goes well beyond the idea of a freelance programmer, to include aspects of a business consultant.  (Finally, really good proof of this is that in some cases you may well be able to hand off the actual coding to someone who will follow your instructions at a low hourly rate.  The fact that this is even a possibility suggests that the value you&#x27;re describing and capturing may not be in the specific programming at all, but a different layer entirely.)",1417806220

You seem to be suggesting that people should be allowed to reveal classified national secrets that are legal both nationally and internationally if they find them unethical.  I think this is a dangerous precedent to set.  Different people will have wildly different views on what is ethical when it comes to war and espionage.  That is why it is important to codify these things into laws and international treaties.",1417806080

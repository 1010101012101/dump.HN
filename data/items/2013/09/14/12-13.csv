It utilizes computer vision and a 3d depth map (generated by using an IR projector and receiver) to make an educated guess as to your bodies orientation. \nLine of sight (needs to see you), Field of View (need to be within range), Body orientation (need to look humanoid, i.e. upright with 2 arms and legs), movement speed (not faster than the optical sensor or IR projector), clothing (not too baggy), lighting (low IR), etc, can all effect the (limited) accuracy of the kinect.<p>PrioVR: A system like this provides accurate positioning of all necessary joints in your body to form a true 3d representation of your skeletal orientation without any of the optical limitations or guesswork of the kinect. You could also use it outside, walking down the street, with a laptop in a backpack. i.e. it could be used for augmented reality in any situation.<p>In the future, I would expect a HMD (some kind of visor - an oculus with a camera in the short-term maybe), a full body suit (like this), and some gloves (the next project these guys will be working on) to be how we augment reality.

6385363,comment,6385105,6385236,10,0,rcfox,,,"> I don&#x27;t buy the speed argument. In a modern PC, many things are pluggable. PCI express can transmit up to 30 GB/s, IIRC. Even CPUs and RAM are modular. If there was such a benefit from soldering them together, I&#x27;m sure we would be seeing more integrated systems.<p>The issue between the CPU and memory isn&#x27;t throughput (the vast majority of operations are <=64 bits at a time), it&#x27;s latency. Latency is directly affected by the amount of wire between the two things. In a desktop, you can offset the latency to a large, replaceable memory module by adding smaller amounts of more expensive memory (cache) directly in the CPU chip.<p>> Furthermore, the modem part of many smartphones is already a black box that is heavily isolated from every other component. It&#x27;s basically just hooked into a bus, and connected to microphone, speakers, and antennas, and doesn&#x27;t necessarily interface that much with the CPU.<p>This is partially true. The CPU still needs to control the radio, and they&#x27;re constantly feeding each other data. You might want to send the audio data through a DSP for audio processing. The microphones/speakers will be shared between the two, and probably go through a codec. Also, Qualcomm radios and CPUs are pretty tightly coupled. If you want to do CDMA for the US (they seem to have patents on all of the CDMA tech) then you need to use a QC radio, which means that you need to use a QC processor, a QC codec, ...

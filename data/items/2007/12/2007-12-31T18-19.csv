93947,comment,93888,93888,0,0,optimal,,,"Developers continuously push the envelope, so building state-of-the-art applications will always be difficult and time consuming. It's the last 10-20% of development--the truly hard finishing part--that takes an application from ""good enough"" to ""really cool"" (also from being permanently labeled ""beta"").<p>As an analogy, there was a time when breaking the four minute mile barrier as a runner was considered impossible. Now it's quite common. Yet it's just as difficult to be the fastest runner.<p>My advice would be to become familiar with a number of web frameworks _and_ understand how to build your own. This will take some time, but the benefit will be your understanding of when to use frameworks and when not to. One question to consider is what sort of projects are you planning to build? If it's a one-off for a client, would a framework get most of the job done? If it's a product you'll be hosting or distributing, will you be living with the code base for a long time and therefore benefit from the investment of your time in development?",1199126485

I know there are a bunch of other YC searches out there, but we're trying to improve on all of them.<p>1. nycs.bigheadlabs.com - a good one created by the Disqus guys, but they stopped updating the index quite awhile ago, so all of the search results are stale.<p>2. trk7.com/yc - Another YC search, but the interface is really confusing.<p>3. ycsearch.com, Google - Indexes insanely fast and has an excellent relevancy algorithm, but you can't sort by post date or points.<p>4. Firefox toolbars, etc - I haven't tried them, but I assume it just uses a Google custom search.<p>5. SearchYC.com - full text searching, 15 minute updates, and a cool user-search feature (try searching for your username (case-sensitive)). We also enable sorting results/submissions/comments by relevancy (sucks), YC points, or post date.<p>What we really want to do is to start generating some user stats and  interesting queries such as ""top points per submission"", ""most linked-to websites"", etc. If you're interested in one, post it here!<p>Anyways, we want you guys (YC users) to help us decide where this goes. The sky's the limit!<p>Happy New Year's!",1199125549

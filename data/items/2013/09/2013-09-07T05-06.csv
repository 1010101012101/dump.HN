I agree totally.<p>I don&#x27;t think Java-style typing is that much of a hindrance. It&#x27;s irritating boilerplate, but people using those languages can slam it out very quickly.<p>I don&#x27;t think reasoning about runtime types is any more difficult than reasoning about compile-time times, it&#x27;s in fact a higher cognitive load because you cannot ignore it and rely on a type-checking phase that covers all your paths without explicit test cases.<p>I personally found Ruby to be productive[1] due to the expressive metaprogramming, how easy it is to make DSLs, blocks and yield for CPS, generators, and co-routines, and how everything is re-definable. I don&#x27;t know how much dynamic typing factors into that, but I think if you could get the same things with equally expressive syntax, Rubists would still like it.<p>[1] It used to be my favorite.

The spin keeps its air resistance relatively low and gravity does not work against the horizontal component of the bullets velocity.  The bullet, fired slightly not straight up, will therefore hit you with whatever velocity it got from falling nose first from apogee, combined with whatever velocity sideways it started with (minus some from air resistance).<p>Bullets fired from a rifled barrel straight up will turn over and tumble at appogee, and their velocity on return will be only terminal velocity of the bullet tumbling through the air.  Presumably this case is safe, though potentially painful.<p>Birdshot is safe I assume because the mass of the individual pellets are low enough so that air resistance <i>is</i> enough to arrest its velocity to something safe.

By going the route of simply aggregating listing info and posting information easily accessible on other sites, they relegated themselves to being just another real estate listing website.<p>Their growth was then limited to how many phone calls and connections they make - in other words, no one was beating down their doors to list on their site and only after years of growing this way did they command some semblance of a home buyer audience that made it worth while for the sellers.<p>The model these guys implemented is tried and tired and brings nothing new to the table.

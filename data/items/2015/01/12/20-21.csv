We had written ours in STAR 0, the only assembler that Burroughs supported on the 205. It had been Dick Berman&#x27;s first programming project. Our compiler took one hour and 45 minutes to assemble. The first week of don&#x27;s project he spent in writing his own assembler. He could assemble his compiler in 45 minutes. We were green with envy.

8876340,comment,8872054,8873195,0,0,devonkim,,,"Dismissing coding from being &quot;difficult&quot; makes sense to most of us on HN that are somewhat competent. However, most of us haven&#x27;t experienced truly terrible programmers that are very commonplace in big corporate and government shops (this is changing as we finally start adopting platforms at least semi-interested programmers pick instead of &quot;I need a job&quot; programmer types). At a point, if your engineers are so slow and unproductive even without the typical hoops of enterprise dysfunction, it is a bigger problem than if you don&#x27;t have someone that knows the business well. Good engineers can be misled by just bad business requirements for a while and pivot back around quickly because their code is far, far easier to refactor, re-architect, and reframe. Most enterprises treat programmers (due to their cultural DNA of massive, over-managed projects like in big construction projects) like assembly line workers where output and skills mostly only differ by age and individual skill is not a significant factor (it&#x27;s part of how we keep seeing houses constructed by low-skill labor despite many higher skilled, probably more efficient skilled laborers present yet constantly unemployed or underemployed). Better programmers also translates to less ugly hacks and better long-term solutions and designs as well (I said better, not more clever). And lastly, they can just plain code away some terrible hacks for the sake of a demo to keep everyone paid if the situation calls for it. Business domain rules and systems being very people-driven typically (by virtue of the people that wrote them typically being centered around people-first, not process-first) and with very imprecise human language by default are really, really slow to enact typically too. Besides the cost issues, a good engineer&#x27;s work is far, far easier to sell anyway to where a mediocre, barely competent sales person should be able to get similar results with the usual sales guy pitching <random $1M suite of ERP software with $150M professional services over 6 years>.<p>So in short, good engineers with ineffective domain knowledge might make a great solution... that sadly doesn&#x27;t solve what the person with the check wants up-front but you can put the most capable domain experts and managers to lead a team of bad engineers and the software will be both expensive to maintain (raising prices for the unfortunate customers) and perhaps just plain not work very often, causing more band-aid &quot;solutions&quot; that riddle cash-strapped bureaucracies and pass the dysfunction onto us as customers. I&#x27;m confident that tech is not the solution for most dysfunctional organizations and that IT projects just bring out the worst in them.",1421095820

Without enough private sector investment, you can&#x27;t grow an economy, you can&#x27;t bring in higher tax revenue, and so on.<p>You don&#x27;t primarily grow an economy through massive reproduction anyway, you do it through innovation and productivity gains. If population gains were the key to massive economic gains, Nigeria would be a leading economy, and Sweden / Denmark / Norway / Switzerland would have spent the last 20 years languishing.<p>Or take Germany, their population has hardly moved in 40 years. Their GDP has increase nine fold in that time (and is still a dramatic increase accounting for inflation).<p>Japan&#x27;s nominal GDP hasn&#x27;t moved in 20 years. In that time their population has remained essentially flat (+2m). In those same 20 years, Germany&#x27;s population has actually declined. And in that time Germany boosted its GDP by 77% roughly.

The last thing you&#x27;re going to want in the next century is a vast oversupply of human labor. Japan should allow their population to continue contracting, while they focus on replacing human labor with robotics and artificial intelligence / software.<p>That&#x27;s where a large portion of the economic growth in the next several decades is going to come from, the vast productivity gains to be found in those two areas.",1421095701

So the database has to take both the data you provide in your AST as well as data about the tables and fields you specify to figure out where to find your data in a distributed database.<p>Contrast that with the redis example where the client <i>must</i> specify a key that redis then knows how to map to a shard. The logic is much simpler and easier to implement.<p>Redis has shards builtin to the method you use to query it which allows Redis to simplify the logic of distributed queries.<p>SQL does not have a notion of sharding builtin in to it so this complicates the query plan logic when it comes to sharding.",1421094679

8876196,comment,8868035,8875860,0,0,teddyh,,,"I’ll summarize my arguments for clarity:<p>There are obviously some things which affect metabolisms and brain chemistry which are either perfectly harmless or things that should obviously be permitted without supervision, e.g. exercise.  Likewise, there are many, many things which nobody should ever mess with without serious medical consultation and possibly exploration of all other alternative options.<p>The question is, how does one draw the line between them?  The government/state/doctors (one’s local FDA equivalent) purports to do this, and they have a lot in their favor, with large budgets, scientific studies and general trustworthiness.  They are, however, hampered by tradition (e.g. grandfather clauses) and politics (e.g. drug war).  This makes them obviously imperfect.  The second, fallback, alternative, which people have relied on for as long as people have existed, is the grapevine.  Hearsay, rumors, anecdotes, fads, trends, that sort of thing.  These <i>also</i> have obvious problems, which I trust I don’t need to enumerate further.<p>My first argument is this: However imperfect the first option is, it is obviously better than the second option.  I also suggested a third option, namely to <i>select</i> another large institution with the same advantages as the first option, but perhaps with less of the disadvantages.  One could even mix and match, and, for instance, follow the FDA’s recommendations for all things except for weed, where one might choose to follow the equivalent authority in Portugal or maybe the Netherlands.  My second argument is that with this third option, simply choosing the fallback second option is, indeed, of questionable sanity and prone to self-selection, cherry-picking and other kinds of experimental failure, all of which leads to bad science and extremely questionable and unreliable results.<p>The first option is the simple one, and is obviously acceptable.  The third option is reasonable.  The second one is indefensible given the availability of the other two.<p>The ease by which people fall to the second option when the first (large, traditional and authoritative) one fails them reminds me of this passage from Father Brown in <i>The Oracle of the Dog</i> (G. K. Chesterton, 1926):<p><i>‘</i> […] <i>It’s part of something I’ve noticed more and more in the modern world, appearing in all sorts of newspaper rumours and conversational catchwords; something that’s arbitrary without being authoritative.  People readily swallow the untested claims of this, that, or the other.  It’s drowning all your old rationalism and scepticism, it’s coming in like a sea; and the name of it is superstition.’  He stood up abruptly, his face heavy with a sort of frown, and went on talking almost as if he were alone.  ‘It’s the first effect of not believing in God that you lose your common sense and can’t see things as they are.  Anything that anybody talks about, and says there’s a good deal in it, extends itself indefinitely like a vista in a nightmare.  And a dog is an omen, and a cat is a mystery, and a pig is a mascot and a beetle is a scarab, calling up all the menagerie of polytheism from Egypt and old India; Dog Anubis and great green-eyed Pasht and all the holy howling Bulls of Bashan; reeling back to the bestial gods of the beginning, escaping into elephants and snakes and crocodiles; and all because you are frightened of four words: “He was made Man.”’</i>",1421094199

The successes, to my knowledge at least, are those that integrate statistical analysis with some universal grammar properties, some fundamental properties of language; when they&#x27;re integrated, you sometimes get results [...] On the other hand there&#x27;s a lot work which tries to do sophisticated statistical analysis,\nyou know bayesian and so on and so forth,\nwithout any concern for the uh actual structure of language, as far as I&#x27;m aware that only achieves success in a very odd sense of success. There is a notion of success which has developed in\ncomputational cognitive science in recent years \nwhich I think is novel in the history of science.\nIt interprets success as approximating unanalyzed data.&quot;<p>The model that has become dominant in statistical AI -- positing a basic grammar that is strongly underconstrained and eliminating spurious analyses not through &quot;universal grammar&quot; (i.e. presupposed innate structures) but through learned parameters, would be something that Chomsky has been very much against; Simultaneously, work that models grammar with enough precision that you could derive predictions from it (e.g. Ed Stabler&#x27;s grammar implementation) are seen as nice-to-have but not central to the undertaking of generative grammar.<p>And I think Chomsky put his thumb right on the difference in goals: Chomsky defines progress in linguistics as work that posits the right (&quot;universal&quot;) structures, and argues that these are cognitively real and innate, whereas statistical AI is more interested in predicting useful things with structures that may or may not correspond to anything that is cognitively real.<p>To people nowadays, the whole notion of constrained &quot;universal&quot; models with few statistics versus underconstrained &quot;statistical&quot; models seems to be a very minor one, since today&#x27;s statistical models have a lot of structure, and people doing generative grammar aren&#x27;t totally opposed to using statistics or optimality theory to select most-plausible structures. But, back in the day, when the most expressive statistical models people used were HMMs [hidden Markov model - a probabilistic regular grammar] and PCFGs [probabilistic context-free grammars], the gap was much wider, whereas nowadays the models are a bit more similar while the goals are still different.",1421093946

It doesn&#x27;t really sound like it.<p>Septic tanks do have to be built differently, but they do work at extreme temperatures.<p>Yes, you do insulate pipes better, yes you do also use heat tape to prevent pipes from freezing. This is pretty standard practice. In general, if you&#x27;re heating something in the ground, you&#x27;re going to have it well insulated, and heat it to barely above freezing. The ground, though frozen does provide a great deal of insulation as well. When the air is really cold, the ground is going to be significantly warmer The big issue here is melting that permafrost and causing the ground to sink. This wrecks foundations and cracks pipes.<p>Yes, we do use block heaters, but you also have to start your car and let it warm up for quite a while before driving. Cars do behave differently at -40, but they are still usable. Once you start dropping below -50F, cars do start behaving really poorly. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend biking in those temperatures unless you know what you&#x27;re doing. My dad usually stops riding his bike to work at around -30F.<p>Yes, the cost of living (for many, but not all things) is higher in remote areas. No, the cost does not rise 10x.<p>Heating is a big expense, but can be mitigated by building well insulated homes. There is a high prevalance of dry cabins for lower incomes, since the lack of plumbing means you can afford to let a building freeze if you don&#x27;t have tenants to pay for heat. That said, you can also heat or supplement the heat for your house the old fashioned way, with a wood burning stove.<p>Yes, many of the issues (and choice) above have a lot of do with poverty. Most of the ways you can reduce the costs of living in an extreme environment (high quality windows, good insulation, a heated garage for your car) require initial outlays of capital.

8876100,comment,8874690,8874690,0,0,tzs,,,"I&#x27;m confused about how precedent works in this kind of case.<p>Generally, the precedent that a particular court must follow in a case is the rulings of courts that its ruling in the case can be appealed to. So, a California district court has to follow 9th Circuit precedent in a copyright case, because it will be the 9th Circuit appeals court that gets the case on appeal. The California district court does not have to follow, say, 2nd Circuit precedent, because the case will not ever reach the 2nd Circuit appeals court.<p>For a patent case, the path is a little different. All patent appeals go to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) rather then to the Circuit appeals courts. Thus, a California district court hearing a patent case follows CAFC precedent, because that&#x27;s where the case will go on appeal.<p>The Oracle-Google case is <i>both</i> copyright <i>and</i> patent. Because of the patent aspect, the appeal from the district court went to the CAFC. Although a copyright appeal would not go to CAFC on its own, CAFC is allowed to handle it when it is part of a patent case. Thus, we end up with the CAFC issuing a copyright ruling.<p>What I do not understand is which courts have to take the CAFC copyright ruling as precedent.<p>Suppose I sue someone over copyright in California, and suppose there are no patent issues anywhere near the case...it&#x27;s just a pure copyright case. The appeal then will go to the 9th Circuit appeals court, not to CAFC, so does the district court in this case have to follow CAFC&#x27;s Oracle ruling? Or do they look strictly to what the 9th Circuit has said?<p>Given the theoretical basis for precedent, I&#x27;d expect that the district court follows the 9th Circuit.<p>If that&#x27;s the case, suppose that the defendant would really prefer to operate under CAFC copyright precedent rather than 9th Circuit copyright precedent. Could he try to add a patent counterclaim, so that the appeal would go to CAFC, and so the district court would have to follow CAFC precedent? Would I have a reasonable chance under FRCP Rule 42 to ask for separate trials on the copyright and patent issues?",1421093181

The services may or may not talk amongst themselves, either via the same public API, or a private one. If you make a request to one of the services, and that service needs to make a request to another service to generate the response, you&#x27;ve got to make a call on whether you want a blocking or non-blocking approach. Consider:<p>1) Blocking until the other services have responded<p>2) Pinging the server to check when it&#x27;s done<p>3) Using web sockets<p>4) Whatever the hell else you can think of<p>Alternatively, you might want not want to expose your services publicly, and choose to have a single service that talks to the services on the clients behalf, a middleman. Your client speaks to this service, and the service sends of various requests to the other services. But the problem still stands. To block, or not to block?<p>AFAIK some big names like Amazon, Spotify, (Twitter?) have multiple public services. You may sometimes notice individual components on their [web] applications failing without bringing down the whole site, since the failures are isolated to the different services.

Humans are terrible drivers. A robot doesn&#x27;t get tired, drunk, spaced out,  inattentive, distracted, or perform dangerous maneuvers or fall asleep at the wheel. They are able to accurately assess the safest way to drive, humans are terrible at that and incredibly bad at assessing risk. Robots don&#x27;t have blindspots or loss of vision at night. Robots have quicker reflexes and a wider field of view. Robots don&#x27;t get road rage. Robots dont get senile. Robots know the rules of the road. You need little more than a pulse to get a drivers license. I&#x27;m shocked how often licensed drivers get confused by 4 way stops.<p>Honestly, its terrifying to put my life in the hands of humans.

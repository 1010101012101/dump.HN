So legally, they don't have a leg to stand on because they've already folded and accepted your right to supplement their service with your little app. I(f they had strenuously objected straight out of thegate that would be a different situation, but they've already committed to a course of action and now they're backtracking. You can show you dealt with them in good faith (I presume) so I think you're quite safe with 'thanks, but no thanks'.",1241156222

Any business whose success hinges on such an app was equally incompetent in choosing it.<p>And let me make this very clear. We write our apps for modern browsers first and then fix the various flukes and oversights that have made IE 6 such a royal pain to deal with last and we are doing so in even quicker and dirtier ways the longer it drags on. I work at a major retailer that was probably also late in upgrading from IE 6 and even our managers are sick of hearing about what we can't do because IE 6 has market share and have stopped caring if people get an obviously subpar or uglier experience on that ridiculous browser if it shaves a week or two off of development.<p>And what, you're worried about security? That's why you're sticking it out with IE 6 and an ancient version of Outlook? Please.<p>Any IT department that's still on IE 6 is being run by somebody who was probably more attracted to IT for the favorable pay to training ratio and who has too little faith in their abilities and the abilities of the people they're responsible for to upgrade a freaking browser for crying out loud.<p>I don't care about how big your networks are. I don't care about your ridiculous IE 6-only apps that you should have been searching for alternatives to six months after IE 7 came out and you still didn't get updates from the ""developers"" (hacks with a GUI IDE of some sort more likely). If you're still on IE 6 you're not really interested in information technology, you don't know what you're doing and it's no surprise that management has started favoring cheap labor from overseas over homegrown incompetence. It's not like you're any better at communicating or have fewer excuses than some guy they picked up off the street in India anyway.<p>Cheap shot? Sure it is but how come nobody is coming after my job? It's not like JavaScript syntax is hard or anything right? If IT professionals were doing what they ought to be doing, which is continually honing their skills and improving the productivity of businesses rather than holding them back for fear of revealing their own incompetence they'd be seen as an asset rather than a necessary evil and an expense.<p>If your business is still on IE 6, whoever is responsible doesn't deserve their job as far as I'm concerned.",1241154675

Delays in deployment, denying projects that had significant investment and a highly opaque culture that is leading to tons of unrest. It finally took going after what really matters, money, for anyone to grow some balls and take this on. Hopefully, Apple will wake up a bit after this happens.

588122,comment,587518,587518,0,0,danbmil99,,,"I suspect the main reason MS or Google or anyone else prefers young programmers is that they tend to be more committed and 'fresh', in the sense that they are not yet bitter, cynical, and hopelessly opinionated.  They also tend not to have as heavy a set of personal/family obligations, so can work cheaper, longer hours etc.<p>And of course on average, if you're too lazy to actually find out from the interviewee, they probably tend to have more up-to-date skills.<p>OTOH, a seasoned veteran often has a knowledgebase in a specific problem domain that can be immensely valuable.  However, it takes a lot of work to find the right person and ensure that his KB is the real thing, is up to date, and that the personality attached to the KB is going to mesh with the culture of the rest of the team.<p>When things are going gangbusters, it's easier to just ignore these subtleties and hire the lusty, naive young waifs who will work their skinny little asses to the bone for da man before they realize their souls are being sucked dry by evil sorcerers.",1241154404

Netbooks typically are not the main laptop of the user. As such, they do not need to be super fancy and used more as a very portable backup.<p>2. As computers get more powerful, more and more people are finding that most applications can run without massive computing power. Thus, people are starting to find Netbooks to be a much better value than their more expensive counter-parts.",1241154198

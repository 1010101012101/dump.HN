6106475,comment,6106189,6106248,13,0,lkrubner,,,"A step forward was made by RoomKey. You should read what their CTO wrote. At RoomKey, they made several radical decisions that gave them a very unusual architecture:<p>--------------<p>Decision One: I put relational data on one side and static&quot;, non-relational data on the other, with a big wall of verification process between them.<p>This led to Decision Two.  Because the data set is small, we can bake in&quot; the entire content database into a version of our software.  Yep, you read that right.  We build our software with an embedded instance of Solr and we take the normalized, cleansed, non-relational database of hotel inventory, and jam that in as well, when we package up the application for deployment.<p>We earn several benefits from this unorthodox choice.  First, we eliminate a significant point of failure - a mismatch between code and data.  Any version of software is absolutely, positively known to work, even fetched off of disk years later, regardless of what godawful changes have been made to our content database in the meantime.  Deployment and configuration management for differing environments becomes trivial.<p>Second, we achieve horizontal shared-nothing scalabilty in our user-facing layer.  Thats kinda huge.  Really huge.<p>-----------------<p><a href=""http://www.colinsteele.org/post/27929539434/60-000-growth-in-7-months-using-clojure-and-aws"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.colinsteele.org/post/27929539434/60-000-growth-in...</a>",1374810747

It was an interesting talk but one thing I remember was this: he said that you can&#x27;t just cut up a sell a pizza by the slice and replicate what you have in NYC.<p>The point of this is that pizza by the slice is a culture that comes about and continues to exist for historical reasons, namely that Manhattan (in particular) is densely populated and people walk a lot, which has a bunch of other consequences. You can&#x27;t just replicate that.<p>Also in NYC we have wash and fold laundromats. I walk five blocks to work and pass four of them on 8th Avenue. They&#x27;re open 7 days a week (one from 7am-11pm every day). They will pick up your laundry and drop it off or you can drop it off and pick it up yourself.<p>Typically you pay $0.60-1.00/lb (plus something per load) for this and drop it off in the morning you get it back the same day. There are historical reasons for this but again it survives due to cultural and infrastructure reasons.<p>So something like this doesn&#x27;t really work in low density car-dominated locales like the Valley.<p>I&#x27;m a little confused by Prim because ultimately they&#x27;re just a courier service for clothes that subcontracts the cleaning to local laundromats. Okay...<p>But I question the demand for this given the economics and different culture.<p>This also highlights to me the benefits of living high-density as lots of things become possible. Effective public transport for example.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mayGAx9ngvo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mayGAx9ngvo</a>",1374810585

But that&#x27;s a socioeconomic prediction, not a legal opinion.

I was driving to work and knew &quot;something was up&quot; because I was receiving an usual number of &quot;new follower&quot; e-mails from Twitter but no alerts were generated because the VPS was handling it just fine.

Great rappers don't necessarily need to have complex rhyme schemes, and a complex rhyme scheme does not a great rapper make. Neither does a complex rhyme scheme alone make a great writer, as content and the use of various literary devices come into play as well.<p>IMHO, the mark of a truly great rapper is the ability to become an instrument on the track while still communicating a great deal in a small number of words. Flow and presence are as important as lyrics and rhyme schemes, and a great rapper is one who has at least 3 out of those 4 qualities at a high level, with the 4th not bad enough to detract from the others.",1359050332

Looking at the lines from each you've quoted, other than the 3rd line from Macklemore I immediately get exactly what he's communicating in the song. Nas's song is much more like a poem, I understand the metaphors and get the general gist of the song after reading your lyrics, but on a quick listen I wouldn't have much of an idea of what the song is even about.<p>Maybe it's just a storytelling vs. poem artistic difference.

5110943,comment,5107615,5108349,2,0,Cushman,,,"Well, there's no force that makes traffic ""rise to fill roads""; there's externalities to having increased traffic capacity that may cause transportation needs to increase. We still have a lot of underutilized roads.<p>The main difference in terms of capacity, I think, is that once we have majority- and fully-autonomous roads, the system will actually not allow the road to exceed capacity. Individual vehicles will respond to signs of lower throughput by getting off of the potentially congested road, while centralized signaling systems will help coordinate routes and departure times to optimize-- and due to the non-Newtonian nature of traffic, keeping throughput high actually increases road capacity.<p>So if you get into your car at 9am and say, ""Take me to work,"" it's not going to say, ""Time with traffic: One hour,"" it's going to say, ""We should depart in twenty-five minutes."" Even better, if you are subscribed to a service like most Americans will be, you'll instead tell them the day or week or month before, ""I need to be at work by 9am,"" and they'll say, ""There will be a fifteen dollar capacity fee.

Or course you could zrange chunks, and it would be more efficient, but what's wrong with a simple START and NEXT semantic?<p>BUT this is all a moot point - a Sorted Set is not the type of structure that something like SQLite4 needs anyway.

The U.S. and over 2'dozen of our allies' intelligence agencies believed that Iraq had chemical and biological weapons before the war started.

However, there are multiple ways to do this because all of the options have limitations and are somewhat awkward to use.  For instance, I don't think resource plugin you linked to supports renaming as part of the copy.<p>Why is using your build to push files to a remote server a problem?  A common use would be to deploy local code to an environment that simulates production.  If that cannot be done as part of the build then it will exist as scripts that exist outside of the build.

5110674,comment,5109052,5110132,2,0,laumars,,,"My issue largely about the scalability of pipes. They're ok for basic tasks, but not great for complicated routines:<p>1) You've only got one send and one return. (well, arguably more if you include stderr and exit codes, but they have their own limitations in addition to the aforementioned)<p>2) They're too insular from each other; different files dotted about that needs to be loaded into the memory then executed. It adds quite a massive overhead. Granted this isn't an issue for the kind of jobs you'd write shell scripts for in the first place, but it does severely hamper this kind of model in terms of scalability. But then we're back to the age old issue of performance vs convenience.<p>I will concede that the second point is more an issue about implementation rather than concept though. But if you were to write a lower level implementation of Unix pipes, I don't think it would pretty much end up with Perl functions (which, to be fair, you suggested yourself). I say Perl specifically because you can create a function without specifying what values to accept (see example below), which is akin to the 'dumb' strings read in from STDIN.<p><pre><code>    sub PerlFunc() {
        foreach (@_) {
            $i++;
            print ""Parameter $i == $_\n"";
        }
    }
</code></pre>
So I'm not really saying that pipes isn't the ""right approach"". Just that it isn't always the best approach. But for things like system administration, pipes are invaluable. Not just because the tools are already written (ie the wealth of command line applications), but also because it's quick to express yet highly readable.<p>I'm not really sure if that answers your question though (or even if I've said anything you don't already know).",1359047620

5110594,comment,5098218,5098406,1,0,FinalEchelon,,,"Just thinking out loud (k, so ""on keyboard"")...<p>Your question inevitably comes to the issue of priorities and of personal accountability to those priorities regardless of moral influence.<p>Personal case in point: My 4 year old daughter contracted Streptococcus Pneumoniae Meningitis; serotype 19a. An extremely antibiotic resistant disease with a mortality rate of 20% with 48 hours of initial contraction (most people dont begin to show symptoms until 12 to 24 hours after initial contraction basically leaving them with about 24 hours to live). Of those who survive 80% are left with mild to severe mental disability. Her life was saved and she made a full recovery with no disability at all. Even the doctors were shocked at how well she recovered.<p>The antibiotic she was given is a synthetic drug that was developed in a lab and was allowed to go to human testing only after testing it on animals to determine it's safe dosage levels (some levels are considered corrosive and fatal). I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure many animals suffered and died during that particular phase of its development.<p>Ergo, numerous animals suffered and died so that my daughter (and many others that needed that medication) could live and return to a normal life.<p>I fully respect and understand someone's choice to not eat meat, even to go so far as to avoid animal based products. I don't believe animals should be made/allowed to suffer needlessly. However it seems to me that it comes to an issue of priorities (whether influenced by morals or not). In this case I find it morally wrong to make animals suffer, however my daughter's health is a much higher priority. Therefore, if an animal must suffer and die in order for my daughter live then so be it. The priority overrules the moral.<p>To anyone who would maintain that a conscious animal holds the same intrinsic and/or perceived value as a human I would simply ask this: would you allow someone you love to die so that you could prevent the suffering of an animal, or at the very least, not be a benefactor from the suffering of an animal?<p>Another, friendly way of putting it could be this: What are your priorities, not morals, regarding animal testing vs. human benefit and how influential are your morals when it comes to the establishment of those priorities?<p>While I used the issue of animal testing the basic logic can be applied to any area of your questioning.<p>Example:
I find it immoral to kill people.
Those I know and love are a higher priority than those I do not.
Someone wishes to harm those I know and love.
If needed I will end the life of someone I dont know to protect the life of someone I do know even though my morals say to not kill.
My predetermined priority (keep those I love safe at all cost) overrules my moral inclination (do not kill).<p>But this brings us to the core problem with societies of any size and as a whole:
What if the person who wished to do harm instead did what is moral because they made the choice to set their priorities according to a moral standard and hold themselves personally accountable to those priorities? Then I would not have my priorities overrule my morals because there would be no need; the example above would not have taken place.<p>You say it seems impossible to do what is moral but you're viewing morality at a level that you have no control over. If you focus on making your priorities line up with a moral standard and have personal accountability to those priorities then you will begin to see that, while you cant save the whole world, you can at least save a small part of it, yourself included.<p>Now imagine if everyone focused on making their priorities line up with a moral standard and saving their own small part of the world. Therein lies the strength and ability to save the world from itself.<p>Unfortunately the choice to hold to priorities that don't compromise (at least most) moral standards is a choice that society can only make as a whole.<p>ie. you decide you don't want to blow me up anymore; I can now follow my moral of ""do not kill"" without it being overruled by my priority of ""dont get blown up"".<p>True this doesn't help with the original example of animal testing to develop cures that save human lives, but if you find a way to instill moral standards in bacteria I will gladly nominate you for as many science awards as I can.<p>-FE",1359046856
5110593,comment,5109052,5109395,3,0,anon1385,,,"Is efficiency the biggest problem?
It seems to me the bigger problem is that streams of raw bytes over pipes is the wrong level of abstraction for most tasks; at least we seem to have decided that is the case when we are writing code within a program, so I don't see why it shouldn't extend to interprocess programming. I don't see people recommending only defining functions that accept single dimensional arrays of bytes (rather than strings and trees and hashmaps and multidimensional arrays and so on), even when programming in C.<p>You end up with every tool containing code to parse a stream of bytes into the appropriate data structures, and then probably also write them out to a stream of bytes too.  The user has responsibility for a lot of data munging too. It is error prone and repetitive, at least when dealing with anything other than very simple text files containing lines of strings where you know which encoding has been used. (Re)using libraries that read and write more structured data is likely to get you flamed[1]. The history of Unix contains plenty of security problems due to people not correctly accounting for nulls or control characters or spaces etc when chaining together commands (although this is more of a problem with shells than pipes themselves). The output is often not friendly to human eyes by default (I'm thinking of things like localised date and time formats, number formats and so on) since it has to be suitable for passing to another program, unless you use more options or another tool to reformat it.<p>I would compare it to working with raw memory in C. It's the lowest common denominator, you can do anything, but it's also trivial to screw up and there is a high cognitive overhead. Perhaps it's just too hard to introduce anything higher level at this point.<p>Perhaps my opinion would change if I spent years (deeply) learning unix tools, but maybe that would just be because I had invested so much time learning a complicated system.",1359046845

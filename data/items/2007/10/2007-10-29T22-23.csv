Communicating the purpose and value of the site clearly and quickly has been a recurring problem (and we still haven't gotten it right yet). <p>To answer your question: The value to you is to find new stuff. So if you are interested in crime comics, you would come to Seekler to quick find some new comics to buy. Ditto with music, movies, etc. If you happen to have an opinion on some area, it'd be awesome if you made a list yourself, but it's not necessary.",1193698331

73980,comment,73953,73953,0,0,corentin,,,"There are two kinds of sloppy: sloppy because it's micro-managed by pointy-haired bosses (in this case, yes, run away!) and sloppy because they just don't know better. In the latter case, you can experiment as you like and bring improvement; it's an interesting challenge and it's rewarding. And if it's a relaxed and funny environment, it's even better!<p>Or you could go with the guys that know everything and are so proud of their system (system that is sooo complex and hard to understand).<p>In both cases you'll learn something valuable, anyway.",1193696531

Things that should take 5 minutes start taking longer and in the long run your killing yourself.

Not many people are entrepreneurs.<p>Microsoft is making money on momentum, not on innovation. They also are not making a lot from online products. Yahoo is doing alright, but again is doing nothing great and is in the dust behind Google.  AOL is horrid, their page views are dropping fast, and they are dumping employees faster.  They are transitioning to owning a few portals and blogs, and hell they use google ads on their site and google search.  They are not a formidable competitor in the least, they are dropping in market share rapidly.  They just fired 20% of their workforce for the second year in a row.",1193695604

73961,comment,73840,73934,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"I don't much care either way, but here are the things I see wrong with your assessment. <p>
1) With the stock options vesting, some of the smart people at Google are leaving. Most are being poached by Facebook or they've gone on to start their own companies. In the Valley, it's true that Google has cause a huge brain drain, but that doesn't mean Redmond doesn't have equally smart people. You've been had by Google PR. <p>As for their solving ridiculously hard problems, that's not the point. It's all about distribution. Google has effectively been able to outgame Microsoft in terms of distribution, for now. Open up Firefox and it's the default search engine. It's now ubiquitous enough to be used as a verb. But that doesn't mean Microsoft is out in the cold, they still rule the desktop and enterprise. In fact, Google  search for enterprise isn't on par to other offerings. The Fortune 500 company I work for has recently switched away from Google and many other IT managers I've spoken with have been jumping ship to either Microsoft or InQuira.<p>2) You point to other companies but offer little. Microsoft may not be doing well with Vista but they're making money hand over fist. Yahoo Search Marketing also has a somewhat different CPC bidding process than AdSense that many are liking more. And as for AOL, they're now transitioning into a full on advertising company and with a lot of cash and Time Warner backing, they're a formidable competitor.  ",1193695345

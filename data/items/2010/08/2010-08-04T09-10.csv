1574104,comment,1573767,1573767,0,0,demallien,,,"The thing I found most interesting about this interview is just how badly Peter Norvig has failed to understand what Facebook is all about - I don't use Facebook so that friends can give me recommendations about what camera to buy - I use Facebook because knowing what my friend Sally got up to this weekend is far more interesting to me than what Britney Spears has been up to.  I <i>might</i> be interesting in knowing what camera she used to take that brilliant photo of Jim under the fireworks, but that's about as close as it gets.<p>This has a huge implication for the value of Facebook - they know who I am, really.  They know where I live, my age, my sex, and they can even tell what sort of activities I like.  Google tries to guess this information from my page view habits, but they often get it wrong, big time.  Here's an example - if I get a dating site ad on Facebook it correctly identifies me as a woman and throws up pictures of guys.  If that ad is being served up by Google, I get identified as a man because of all the time I spend on tech sites, so the same ad has pictures of women in it.  Facebook gives me ads about clothes, Google almost never does.
I suspect that Google's core business is at significant risk here. People are spending more and more time in the Facebook universe, those 'Like' buttons have popped up all over the Web, and that spells trouble for Google.  It'll be interesting to see how they respond,  but I for one won't be buying any more stock in Google for a while.",1280915523

I don't think we're that smart, and I don't (usually) think the rest of the world is that dumb.  Besides, is memorizing soon-to-be-forgotten dates and listening to other students butcher Shakespeare in a uniform monotone exactly right for most students?  Is doing the same math over and over again, boring those who get it and failing to bring understanding to those who don't, exactly right?<p>More people need to be able to find their way to meaningful work (not necessarily creative work.)

You can live on $150 for a whole week if you're frugal and live with roommates. And that's just one class. A day with four classes = $600 you're now in debt.

In other countries especially, a lot of people take a ""gap-year"" and travel and work elsewhere in the world.  That's one option.<p>Some other possibilities are (I'm curious to hear what others think of these):<p>- Find a business/company that would hire you as an intern.  Low pay is OK - the experience is what counts.  It's OK if you don't know what industry to start in, doing any decently attractive job to you brings you one step closer to figuring it out.  (We need to encourage adults/businesses to take in young adults and provide them with experience in different areas, basic mentoring and training).<p>- Attend some sort of career/passion finding school where the entire focus is on you and your development into a thinking being (this wouldn't be needed if public schools did a better job).  I'm curious if places like this exist and how effective they are.<p>- Take a gap year or two and travel and work remotely in various places.  Learn about the world and what exists in it.  This will almost surely develop character faster than waiting tables in your hometown.<p>- Go to a community college or take random classes at any university that interest you until you develop some interest somewhere.<p>As you pointed out, a key factor in motivating someone to follow any logical path is for a person to understand that the paths exist and are as possible as any other, and perhaps even more lucrative.

Make it the primary purpose of the site.  That is, I should be able to go to ""soundkey.com"" and conveniently record and share a sound, rather than seeing a splash page.  You don't visit bit.ly and see a whole page explaining the benefits of short links, and where you can use shorter links.  You see a textbox that you can immediately use.<p>At any rate, this all might sound very critical, but I love your idea.

You can take college level courses in high school. A college level education is supposed to summarize your professional capabilities. As you can see, the problem is that youth is swallowed up by an educational itinerary that leaves very little time for you to do what you want at a time you can make the most out of it.",1280913060

I believe equivalent figures for the 1800s would be closer to 0% R&D inasmuch as there were no Departments of Energy, Health & Human Services, etc., but I'm willing to be proven wrong. Maybe the Gilded Age governments in the US actually spent 2% of GDP on R&D.",1280912764

I share the same anguish and thinking on it led me to believe that the process should start much early (High School and Higher-Secondary). This provides an opportunity to help the kids to work their ways independently (against the social pressure) and figure out what they want to do when it comes to picking an under-graduate course. Given that the current generation has seen much more financial independence than the previous ones (and possibly sharing the same anguish), I think this is the right time to drive the schooling system in the right direction.",1280912621

I'm sorry that you got rejected, but quite frankly, if you didn't get good grades, it's hard for a school to vouch for you mastering basic skills you'll need at the next level. If however, those grades are a reflection of one of many problems of obstacles you may have faced, then that's where your personal statement comes in.  If you decided to do your own thing, then as someone reading applications, I'd rather give your spot to someone else and wish you well in that sense.<p>Whether you decide to go to college or drop out is a decision I hope everyone can live with either way.  At the end of the day, yes, find what you love and do what you love.  Schooling is a great, great way to learn how to do many things, meet many great people, etc. It's not the only path, but it's an easier path for most people because you have the threads of people who came before you and would know how to guide you--assuming you're on the lookout.",1280912594

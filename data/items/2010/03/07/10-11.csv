1173204,comment,1172649,1172649,0,0,matt_is,,,"1 hour : 1 day. I love living cheap because it creates miraculous ratios. For every hour I work now, I get one full day in the future to focus 100% on whatever I want. (I'm about to move to latin america to work on some new stuff, and am finishing up a last-minute web/design contract before I go.)<p>Of course, a good ratio depends not only on living cheap but also getting paid reasonably well for something that doesn't kill you (or your soul).<p>The first time I got anywhere near this ratio was 8 years ago, but to get it I had to sleep in a tent, wake up at 5 AM and plant trees like a madman on the side of a mountain every day for an entire summer. It was my own personal hell, but then paid for a full year of doing what I loved for free, which then led to the best opportunities of my life, so that I never had to go back to those damned mountains again.<p>I'm not very good at side projects... I only really get into the zone when I commit myself to something fully. So being able to partition my life into discrete segments of ""sell my services"" and ""build something I care about"" is valuable to me.",1267959278

Indeed I think that if they notice you showing a willingness to give them the web they want (ad free) you'll get more coming back!<p>> If you would cut those people out and be only left with the people that are prepared to pay in some way then suddenly your website wouldn't be half as interesting.<p>I'm not suggesting that. It's not a paywall or anything - the initial/actual experience would be just the same for a blocker as it is now. Just with the option to pay...<p><i>I think the whole ad blocker discussion is focused way to much on ads being the only way to 'monetize' a user, if there is any exchange at all between a site and a user and you have a feeling that you get more from the user than what it cost you in bandwidth you're under way to solving your problem in a much better way than to worry about a few ad impressions being lost.</i><p>I cant disagree with that (I did try, actually, but I can't :)).",1267959082

In the Euro-Med countries the average number of births per female is about 1.3, far below the replacement rate of 2.1. In Japan (which has the oldest mean age in the world), pop is dropping so fast that they are permanently closing almost one primary school per day.<p><i>Greece bankrupt? Even if it were true, any negative consequences of that will be mitigated by the EU.</i><p>Technically not bankrupt yet, but Greece and most other European countries (and the US, at our current rate of debt growth) had better hope like hell for an AI breakthrough that pushes productivity rates thru the roof.\nWelfare states are pay-as-you-go plans, with the younger generation paying for retirement of the much smaller number of elderly. That only works as long as there are lots of young people and not many older folks. In other words, the cutbacks and riots in Greece and California these last few days are just the beginning w/o huge productivity breakthroughs.

Nagios is a very actively maintained project, and did have major features added about a year and a half ago. It is totally suited for use in large installations, especially with the help of existing third party enhancements like GroundWork Monitor. And on the non-issue of wanting a flexible Nagios, a lack of flexibility is NOT one of Nagios' problems. It is insanely flexible, and has tons of add-ons and plugins. Also being in C, it performs very well, especially the current version. I've looked at the code, and it's not bad - maybe the shinken authors are just intimidated by C.",1267958714

We don't turn anyone away as long as they want to talk about real issues related to bootstrapping.<p>I started them because I was fed up with attending evening events that were either about hearing a VC speak or were in bars and involved bullshit networking. I wanted to take part in serious conversations about entrepreneurship, in particular bootstrapping a business, because there were too few discussions about real problems.<p>We have a unique format for the breakfasts that foster one conversation on a range of topics proposed by those that show up. We have guest speakers sometimes, but they only have prepared remarks for about 6-8 minutes at which point they take part in the conversation. We have invited a number of entrepreneurs to talk about lessons learned from successes and failures including the inventor of MacProject, Writely, Wowzamedia to name a few.<p>I am not sure how you have reached the conclusions about me that you have but you are mistaken in your characterization of my motives.

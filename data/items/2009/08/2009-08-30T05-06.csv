There are clear best practices and plenty of correlation and testing data that refute or add complexity to the recommendations you're making. Please be cautious in giving out SEO advice if you haven't done the research and testing to back it up.<p>In particular:<p>- 301s are permanent redirects and engines pass query independent ranking factors (like link juice, anchor text, etc.) through them. 302s do not always have this benefit.<p>- Trustworthy IP address; this is very, very seldom an issue in SEO anymore (though historically, there were problems with engines like Ask Jeeves)<p>- Separate domains over subdomains is very poor advice if you're giving it universally. I'd check out <a href=""http://www.seomoz.org/blog/understanding-root-domains-subdomains-vs-subfolders-microsites"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seomoz.org/blog/understanding-root-domains-subdom...</a><p>- .org is not preferrable to .com or .net in any meaningful way, nor is it harder to come by. There are no restrictions on a .org<p>- Older sites are not necessarily ""better."" While there may be correlation between the age of a site and its ability to rank, this is much more typically due to the links and reputation its earned, not simply the fact that it's been registered for a lengthy period.<p>- There's a big, big difference between HTML Sitemaps and XML Sitemaps and your statement that it ""doesn't matter"" which you choose shows a concerning level of understanding of the subject...<p>Commendations are definitely due for tackling the subject, but please don't give bad SEO advice; there's so much out there already.",1251610943

794131,comment,793810,794035,0,0,lkrubner,,,"pyre, in your rendition, the punitive attitude acts as some kind of leveling force, effecting the really big corporations at least as much as the small startups. But the article that is linked at the top of this thread (""Company size: Big is back"") implies that the regulatory trend is giving an advantage to the biggest corporations, as such increased regulations impose costs that small firms can not handle. Again, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is worth considering in this context. The biggest firms are the ones most likely to avoid a conflict with the law, as they can afford the legions of accountants and lawyers needed to comply.<p>And, of course, along with a punitive attitude that will likely effect smaller firms most, there are the enormous bailouts being given to the largest firms. As the article says:<p>""Governments have been rescuing companies they consider too big to fail, such as Citigroup and General Motors. Recession is squeezing out smaller and less well-connected firms. But there are other reasons too, which are giving big companies a self-confidence they have not displayed for decades.""<p>I suspect that at some level these attitudes are linked. The flip side of ""too big to fail"" is possibly ""we don't give a damn about the rest of you.""",1251609665

So I'll downplay or omit skills that aren't relevant for the particular job, but that doesn't mean that in a pinch, I couldn't use them.  For example, I'm quite capable of writing a PHP or JSF app, and would probably be better at it than the median candidate in the job market.  But I left those as one-word mentions on my last set of job apps, because I really really didn't want to do PHP or JSF development.  If I got desperate, though, I'd send out resumes to those firms, and it'd be nice to have a script do it for me.

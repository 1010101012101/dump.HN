8996058,comment,8992358,8994208,0,0,S4M,,,"That&#x27;s some interesting points you are making. Just one question:<p>> The basic structure of the page should be simple div based layout enhanced with CSS. Any data that must be rendered in JS ( such as dynamic tables ) can be done by outputting the data in JSON format into the page, and then calling the JS to construct the table. This is faster than adding a calling to a JSON resource to get the data for the table. It allows data and page structure to be sent to the frontend all at once.<p>In html/css are you able to position an element on the page exactly where you want? I am doing at the moment some web development for maths exercises, and I couldn&#x27;t manage to get the positioning right with pure html/css, so I had to resort to:<p><pre><code>    $(&quot;#my_element&quot;).offset({&quot;left&quot;:x,&quot;top&quot;:y});\n</code></pre>\nThe positioning I want is something non trivial because the elements are positioned with respect to each other.<p>I am just nitpicking here, on overall I think your comment is very informative.",1423043998

Modern medicine, long periods of peace and (eventually) welfare provisions have taken care of that. This is a further step in that direction.<p>Evolution works over huge numbers, both in life and death; by effectively reducing the death-count around the globe, we&#x27;re progressively abolishing it for humans.<p><i>> If anything, genetic modification will allow the less gifted to pool funds and improve their own gene pool in a way that was simply not possible before.</i><p>I fear that &quot;pooling funds&quot; could signal a mischaracterization of poor people as &quot;less gifted&quot;, which is absolutely not the case. &quot;The poor&quot; are the ones who have historically improved our genepool, by constantly churning huge numbers of children who would then proceed to fight to death (often literally) for survival and success. &quot;The rich&quot; have always opted for in-breeding, low numbers and social welfare among their peers, resulting in weak genes and lots of hereditary diseases surviving the centuries. In this sense, &quot;the poor&quot; have absolutely nothing to gain from genetic manipulation: children are their only resource and they will continue to produce as many as they can, resulting in a stronger and more variegated gene pool without having to add anything to the process.<p>The GATTACA scenario is real in the sense that a certain mindset is common around modern elites, a view that the rich must be somehow superior to the poor (smarter, healthier, harder-working, etc) otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t be where they are. Policies like Tony Blair&#x27;s suggestion that &quot;fat people should pay more for healthcare&quot; are appallingly neo-darwinistic, but they&#x27;ve also been mostly rejected out of a sense of human decency. I expect this will continue to be the case; as a lot of modern history reminds us, it takes very little to send entire populations back to the Middle Ages, and genetic discrimination would light a very powerful fuse.",1423042699

For large arrays, the problem is that it creates many temporary results of same size as original arrays that must be streamed over the memory bus. And since FLOPs are free and your computation is limited by memory bandwidth, you pay a large penalty for using NumPy (that gets worse as expression gets more complex).<p>Or &quot;a + a.T&quot;... here you can get lots of speedup using basic tiling techniques, to fully use cache lines rather than read a cache line only to get one number and discard it.<p>And so on. For numeric computation, there are large gains (like 2-10x) from properly using the memory bus, that NumPy can&#x27;t take advantage of. So you have projects like numexpr and Theano that mainly focus on speeding up non-loop NumPy-using code.",1423041773

As a rough estimate, I would guess that the majority of German software developers fall in the €40k-€65k salary range. My impression is that developers making €75k+ are outliers.<p>You also have to remember that it&#x27;s hard to directly compare a German salary to an American salary.

I.e., if you try to do a MOVSD without using a 4-byte aligned base address, it will be very slow; similarly a MOVSQ must be 8-byte aligned. I wonder if this is just a case of someone having benchmarked a naive implementation without taking alignment into account? As other commenters have noted, loop unrolling isn&#x27;t a great idea on a modern CPU and it certainly wouldn&#x27;t have got anywhere close to the speed of REP on an older CPU when I was doing this kind of thing.<p>The right way to fix alignment is to have some MOVSB/MOVSW instructions at the start and jump over the correct number based on the difference between your actual base address and the offset you want, then do the rest with REP. I haven&#x27;t tried to pick apart the source in detail but it looks like they are just doing a naive REP.<p>Of course it&#x27;s possible that this is only used in arrays that are known to be 4/8 byte aligned anyway, in which case this comment is irrelevant. However it&#x27;s a very surprising result that the in-built and widely used instruction provided by the CPU for doing exactly this operation is slower than the dumb loop unrolling approach, even with all the instruction cache and memory bandwidth problems it introduces. Odd results like that usually point to programmer error rather than surprising CPU behaviour (although if that were always the case, Michael Abrash&#x27;s books would be a lot less interesting).",1423040867

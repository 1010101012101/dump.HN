For any criminal case there is a corresponding civil action to make the injured party whole. These perps are acting against the law, and as such it&#x27;s obvious they should be subject to both avenues of justice.<p>IMHO the civil approach is just a lot easier to adjudicate - when the victim is found innocent, they should be immediately compensated for any and all damages resulting from arrest, imprisonment, and trial. If the department wants to recoup losses from specific individuals who went against policy, they can settle that much thornier argument on their own time.<p>Proving that a specific individual acted criminally outside their mandate is an even higher burden to meet.

10056747,comment,10055965,10055965,0,0,yellowapple,,,"Well, I guess I&#x27;ll go from the ground up in each category.<p>---<p>For development machines, I have a company-supplied Macbook Air for work and a variety of laptops and desktops that I use for personal things.  The Macbook runs OS X Yosemite.  My personal machines almost invariably run GNU/Linux (I&#x27;ve been especially fond of Slackware lately) or OpenBSD.  My primary rig has a 122-key Unicomp Model M keyboard and a Logitech M570 trackball mouse, along with two monitors (one 1680x1050, one 1440x900); my desk at work has a 2560x1440 Thunderbolt display, connected to one USB port of which are a Logitech K570 solar-powered keyboard (Mac model) and a Logitech M570 trackball mouse (I really do love these trackball mice).<p>My primary editor as of late is Emacs.  My workflow revolves heavily around fiplr for fuzzy-searching and Magit for git repo management (on Linux / OpenBSD, at least; on OS X I use GitX).<p>Git is currently my VCS of choice, though this is more out of necessity (since the vast majority of the projects I work on are hosted on GitHub, be they public or private repos; I use Bitbucket somewhat as well, so I&#x27;ve been looking a little bit into Mercurial lately, but I&#x27;ve yet to really use it for real work).<p>My dayjob revolves around Ruby on Rails programming.  As a result, common Ruby-related tools (in addition to, of course, Ruby itself) - particularly RVM and globally-installed versions of Bundler, gemr, and Rails 4 (mostly for the various generators, though I don&#x27;t really use those a whole lot) - are installed on most of my machines, including the Macbook.  My job is more geared toward system administration and backend programming, so I&#x27;ve yet to explicitly install common frontend-development tools (like Node, bower, grunt, etc.) on very many of my machines, but I do have them installed on the Macbook as a precaution.<p>When it comes to building personal projects, my go-to languages have been Ruby (without Rails; I&#x27;m more a Sinatra/Padrino fan) and Elixir (recently with Sugar, which I find to be much friendlier to use than Phoenix).  I maintain some private Erlang and Elixir Slackbuilds to that effect in order to track the latest versions of both on my Slackware machines (the Erlang on Slackbuilds.org tends to be slow to update, and AFAIK there&#x27;s no Elixir Slackbuild at all yet); I&#x27;ve yet to publish them, but probably will in time.  I&#x27;ve previously used a lot of Perl in my projects, but other than CPAN, I rarely use any Perl-specific tooling.<p>For databases, SQLite and PostgreSQL are my go-tos; I stay clear of NoSQL databases (except perhaps CouchDB or Mnesia), since I don&#x27;t feel that they offer anything compelling over Postgres for my needs.<p>When it comes to the minimal frontend work I do, I generally steer clear of Javascript; when I do need to delve into JS, I&#x27;ve found Mootools to be nice for my uses.  I&#x27;ve been using Yahoo&#x27;s &quot;Pure&quot; CSS framework for things like menu bars and grids, and I&#x27;ve been quite happy with it so far.<p>---<p>Going into servers, my software stack tends to stick to Slackware or OpenBSD.  My mail server runs OpenBSD with OpenSMTPD and a mail pipeline that includes SpamAssassin, spamd, and ClamAV.  Meanwhile, for web servers, I generally go with either Nginx or OpenBSD&#x27;s httpd (depending on whether the server runs Slackware or OpenBSD), along with PostgreSQL and one or more language runtimes (usually Ruby, Elixir, or Perl, inclusively, as described above).  I don&#x27;t really use any sort of config management system (like Chef or Puppet) on my personal servers; I prefer to configure them individually, using Emacs&#x27; TRAMP to edit configuration files over SSH.<p>---<p>I do some general electronics repair, too, on my free time.  I thus carry around a physical toolbox in my truck with at least basic tools and parts (screwdrivers (particularly my really nice ratcheting screwdriver with a bunch of electronics-specific bits), spare USB/ethernet/power/SATA/etc. cables, wire strippers, soldering iron w/ solder, electrical tape, duct tape, crimpers, spare RJ-45 connectors, heatshrink tubing, zip ties for cable management, anti-static strap, multimeter, some spare PCI peripherals (including a spare dial-up modem card; you never know when you need to fix someone&#x27;s dial-up), extra keyboards and mice, bag of spare jumpers, spare flashlight (in addition to the one in my glovebox), some sticks of DDR and DDR2 RAM, various AV cables, speaker wire, the works).

No economic help from my family.  $9.70/hr.  Had my electric turned off a few times.  Phone turned off regularly.  Water turned off.  No gas for a northeast winter.<p>Decided I was sick of it.  Went back to school, took out some loans, but worked my ASS off, trying to get as many hours as possible so as to take out as few loans as possible.  Kept communication open with my bosses and with my professors: I&#x27;m not making shit, I have to keep this job, but I want to make a better life for myself.<p>It was hard.  Hardest thing I&#x27;ve ever done.  Realized that I couldn&#x27;t rely on the cook income, so I started a side business JUST IN CASE they decided to fire me (building websites, took one class that had a week long section on HTML in college).  Hustled.  Replaced my income.  Kept the two jobs, took a full course load.  Awful.  Hated my life, always tired.  I graduated with $10,000 in debt from my bachelors and a post-bacc certificate program.  Could have been a lot more, but I saw what happened if I went down that route.<p>But you know what?

So this all looks to me like it should be a reasonably efficient market, with landlords having little ability to push prices away from the supply/demand balance.

We are currently building foundational tools for emerging business models in the cryptocurrency or Bitcoin 2.0 space. These tools will be packaged into separate ventures that are individually funded and skinned for different business niches.\nWe are hiring 5-15 students for our Fall/Winter 2015 internship program. The primary focus will be to build decentralized applications.  You will have access to our team with a variety of backgrounds, and you will have opportunities to observe and plug into our other ongoing projects. Preferably, you will work with us at our office in NYC. If there is interest we may coordinate housing in a shared space with other interested interns. The internship period is roughly early September - late December, but dates are negotiable.  Since ConsenSys is itself a somewhat decentralized company, with personnel in various cities, remote working interns may be considered.  Please apply by sending an email to opportunities@consensys.net with github, work samples, resume, and general interests in the space. If you include a proposal for a dApp, smart contract, or other useful tool you want to build, we may consider the development of that project. If the internship is successful, there is opportunity to continue the project beyond the Fall internship period with additional support.\nThis is a paid internship.",1439494102

It works great as a fast way to get your app up and running, but it absolutely falls flat on its face as soon as you do anything more complicated than a basic read/write interface.<p>The real problems show up when you&#x27;ve all of a sudden got these old apps out in the field with no way to upgrade them to a newer version of the DB. If you aren&#x27;t being diligent and making all your Parse DB calls through their cloud functions, you are guaranteed to end up in a situation where your older mobile clients are holding back schema and feature evolution. You can try to hack around it using triggers, but these are too buggy to be reliable.<p>Other examples of where Parse is painful:<p>- beforeSave/afterSave triggers are completely unusable! They are unbelievably limited and each one you add slows your app down by as much time as it takes to run. If you want to do something like add users to Mailchimp, you have now tied the length of time it takes to save a user to the length of time it takes to talk to mailchimp!<p>- There is absolutely no way to test your parse code other than uploading it to a parse app and hitting it. You can hack together some node code that sort-of tests it, but it&#x27;s nowhere near representative of what happens on the server.<p>- You can&#x27;t manage Parse.Config programatically. There&#x27;s a web interface and that&#x27;s that. None of your config can live in your git repo because there&#x27;s no way to read or write it from the command-line.<p>- The schema tools are pretty bad on the website. IIRC they introduced REST APIs to make changes to schema recently, but unless you plan on writing tooling around those, you&#x27;ll be manually syncing schema between prod/staging at some point in your life and you&#x27;ll probably also miss a critical column that got added.<p>- Parse has a bunch of weird datatypes that act strangely in their cloud code. Want to make a pointer and store it in a parse field? Construct its internal representation and set it! I wish I was kidding. If you construct a pointer incorrectly, it can actually create a phantom object in another table. Also wish I was kidding about this.<p>- createdAt and updatedAt are special and Parse won&#x27;t let you touch them or set them. Heaven forbid you want to actually set these to a meaningful time other than the actual last time the record was written. Nope. So you end up making your own updatedAt columns and just using those.<p>For your own sanity: stay away from Parse. The range of use cases where it is actually useful is so narrow that you&#x27;ll leave that very quickly unless you are building a toy app.",1439493763

I can tell you that batteries have a very finite lifetime, especially when you abuse them under high-current loads.  I worry that a lot of hybrid/electric owners are in for some sticker shock when their packs wear out.  That one unit is a pretty significant fraction of the total cost and it&#x27;s a wear item.

Essentialy, you get a stream of short messages saying &quot;Pixel XY just got a little brighter at time T&quot;.<p>While such a thing is not very useful for taking pictures (pointing the camera at a static scene will generate no output at all) or videos (you don&#x27;t get discrete frames, you get a continuous stream of differentiated pixels), it has a lot of potential for computer-vision tasks:<p>For one, as the camera only reports changes, only the interesting information is transmitted which greatly reduces computational load (eg. no need for &quot;yes, that white wall is still there&quot;-style calculations for every frame).<p>Secondly, because these changes are reported independently per pixel, they are very fast: Microsecond accuracy with a dozen or so uS delay are easily achievable. For comparison, a fast camera with 120 FPS (which will produce <i>a lot</i> more data to process) has an accuracy and latency of 1/120s = 8333uS. This also implicates that motion blur is basically nonexistent.<p>And thirdly, as absolute intensity doesn&#x27;t matter, you don&#x27;t have any problems with high dynamic range either.<p>The only downside is, that you don&#x27;t really get a picture and most of the traditional computer-vision approaches are unusable ;)<p>But still, such a camera is very neat, even if you just track the movement of your mice or want to balance a pencil on it&#x27;s head[2].<p>The real deal however is full vision based 3D-SLAM, which would allow for very fast and robust movement without any external help from motion capturing systems or expensive (in money, weight and power) sensors like laser scanners.

Google is happy to provide upgrades to the OS in a timely fashion (and are going to start monthly updates), it&#x27;s the vendors/carriers that delay these updates or don&#x27;t even bother to port them over to devices.<p>Google is moving much of the core Android functionality over to specific apps that they can update as needed from the play store, instead of integrating them directly into the OS. This is good, because it allows them to push the updates quicker. They run the risk that carriers will get sick of the lack of control over the &quot;experience&quot; they can provide, and fork android, but it&#x27;s a necessary step in many ways to ensure things like this MMS exploit can be patched on some devices at all, as vendors abandon some phones quickly, leaving users vulnerable.<p>If every vendor and carrier used stock nexus android without modification, the updates could be pushed out in days.

This is Storm 0.9 -- in the years since, I think Storm community in general and the Yahoo folks in particular have been working hard on addressing some of those issues, and a recent blog post from them indicated that some of the stuff we fixed in Heron is on their roadmap. Note that the Heron paper was published a year or so after the first Heron topology went into production inside Twitter. We had a very real problem that we needed to fix very quickly, and writing Heron was faster than making Storm work. Some of that was due to OSS challenges, some due to Storm&#x27;s architecture fundamentals, some due to the specific people and backgrounds we had on the real-time compute team at that point.<p>The scales I am talking about are hundreds of nodes, not dozens, and an order of magnitude more messages per second. I am not surprised it works perfectly well for your use case (it worked fine while we were only putting tweets into it in 2013, as well -- that was about the size you are quoting, iirc).<p>Mesos not only existed when Storm was written, Storm ran inside Twitter on Mesos since before Storm was open-sourced. Mesos went into Apache incubator in 2011, while Storm did so in 2013. I&#x27;m not sure why you got the impression any of this was related to Mesos; it&#x27;s true that we simplified a lot of operational complexity for Storm+Mesos by not writing our own Mesos scheduler, like Storm did, and just using Apache Aurora -- a decision that also meant we were able to use Aurora/Mesos clusters shared with other processes, which was nice; but that wasn&#x27;t the prime motivation by a long shot.<p>The API was kept as a trade-off, to make migration of internal customers seamless. There are problems with the API, particularly around back pressure, but at the same time it was a straightforward API that got wide internal adoption, both in raw form and through Summingbird. So it made sense to evolve that part incrementally and deliver our internal customers the performance, observability, and reliability wins first, without having them rewrite a line of code, and tweak APIs over time to address the above-mentioned issues.<p>I&#x27;m biased of course, but I think our track record with open source contributions is still pretty good -- Scalding, Parquet, Aurora, Mesos, Finagle, Zipkin, and many more major projects with very wide adoption in the industry, which we still very actively contribute to and continue to evolve. At the same time, there&#x27;s definitely a cost to open-sourcing projects, and those decisions get made on a case by case basis.",1439492947

171160,comment,170719,170719,0,0,brianmckenzie,,,"I loved DHH's speech at startup school, but having lived in Chicago and now living in SF, I have to disagree with him on this one.<p>His point seems twofold: 1) The availability of funding in the Bay Area tempts people to take it whether they need it or not, and 2) The competition for top talent is stronger here than anywhere else.<p>The first point, on funding, is news to me. Yes, the availability of VC here is correlated with more Bay Area startups being funded. It doesn't mean that your startup will automatically be funded just because you're located here - the competition for funding is as strong as the competition for talent.<p>I meet people doing self-funded startups all the time. The differentiator is whether you want to be the next Facebook vs. traditional profit model. Yes, the funded web-2.0-ish startups get most of the press here, it doesn't mean that no one is doing it another way.<p>Yes, the competition for talent here is fierce. Right now I'm looking for a CSS expert, no programming required, and even that is nearly impossible to find. However, I know I will find someone sooner or later <i>because I'm located in SF</i>. I shudder to think how hard this would be if I were in St. Louis or something, or even a less tech-centric city like Chicago. A few weeks ago I needed an expert Flex hacker to help with something I'm building, so I just called up my friends until I found one. Try doing that in the midwest. Also, I'm at the kind of small, traditional-profit-type company that DHH so admires.<p>Hackers move here because SF is the best place on earth to be a hacker, and that fact mitigates in your favor when looking for talent.",1208911895

171157,comment,170719,171130,0,0,wanorris,,,"If you live in a metropolitan area (not a given -- like I said, college towns are a nice alternative) -- you generally have the option of living inside the city proper, or living in a suburb. If you want your kids to have a yard to play in, you'll probably end up in a suburb. But that still doesn't mean you have to be a typical suburbanite.<p>Some suburbs are snotty, overpriced McMansion nightmares. Pass. Others are more affordable. And if you find a suburb you can actually afford to live in, you may not have to have both parents working like crazy to make the house payment. One problem solved. Second, you may have the option of taking control of where you work. If you start your own business, you can often find cheap space in the 'burbs. Or you can work out of some kind of ""third space,"" if you don't need an office.<p>Don't get me wrong. I'm definitely not defending the cookie-cutter keeping-up-with-the-Joneses traditional <i>idea</i> of the suburbs. Just the idea that you can make a suburb work as a decent place to live on your own terms if you want to.",1208911793

171140,comment,170719,171066,0,0,tptacek,,,"I don't know. The last big VC-funded company I was with was in Ann Arbor, MI. When the valley influenced the rest of the VC-backed or acquired companies I worked with, it did so by moving the established company out to California. I've never worked for a company whose opportunities came simply from being located in California.<p>Meanwhile, the elephant in the room here is that you aren't <i>going</i> to be acquired by Google, in the same sense as you are not going to win the lottery. There's a get-rich-quick mentality behind web startups that is totally not borne out by the numbers, and it cuts both ways: unrealistic hubris that infects judgement (for instance, by moving teams out of comfortable environments to San Francisco), and devastating emo temper tantrums at minor setbacks, like not being accepted into YC.",1208909599

171138,comment,170772,170937,0,0,hollerith,,,"Most children in the U.S. do not have to go to school if their parents are willing to help them avoid school: the parents need only tell the school district that they are homeschooling their child from now on.  (The parents then of course become responsible for overseeing the child's education.)<p>The school district will probably not like it, but unless the parents are under court supervision for some reason (e.g., the parents were convicted of a crime) the school district probably cannot force the parents to send the child to school, especially if the parents are willing to do research on the internet or appear in court once or twice.<p>But if the child's parents want the child to go to school, then yeah, the child has to go.<p>The public school system is probably a waste of time for a bright child who can learn on his or her own unless the child lives near an exceptionally good public school.  More bright children who have proven that they can learn things on their own should be homeschooled.",1208909424

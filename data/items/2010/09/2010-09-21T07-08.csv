They <i>may</i> have more practice at it.<p>I can do fairly delicate work with a soldering iron, and I can puzzle out simple circuits, and I can work out various values for a circuit if I have pen and paper and a book to refresh my memory. I've also been an output smoothness tech for <a href=""http://www.specsensors.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.specsensors.com/</a> . There is <i>no way</i> I know more about the field than any electrical engineer, not even close. I've worked with those guys. Their college backgrounds actually taught them stuff.<p>I'm less certain about the programming example. There are plenty of stories among hobbyists and professionals of the CS kids that can't code up a linked-list. Then again, there are also lots of non-degreed hacks that can't do that, either. Considering that part of MIT's CS program is to write an operating system (and I know a guy who did that in a weekend, and slapped in a GUI for extra credit), I question whether it's true that the best programmers don't have degrees.",1285055971

I hear the median income in the military is around $120k.  One tenth of the military budget could get teacher's salaries up to that amount, and we'd probably be able to throw in some state of the art learning facilities, smartboards, a computer at every desk, the works in practically every school. We'd have top notch facilities and candidates qualified to use it effectively!<p>Regardless of whether or not we end up using a tenure or merit system for hiring and firing (the benefits outweigh the flaws in the former, imo), schools will, in the end, get the quality of teachers that they are capable of paying for.

1711820,comment,1711171,1711171,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"Yup, here we go again:  US education is <i>falling behind</i> other countries.<p>This time the <i>cause</i> is bad teachers protected by the teachers union.  I'm all for busting up the teachers union, but I don't for a nano second believe that bad teachers are really the cause of what is being observed.<p>Instead, what's being observed is deliberately made up, mostly nonsense, mostly to spend still more money on K-12 education which, with some irony, would help the teachers union!<p>We went through all this just 17 months ago with<p><i>McKinsey's report, The Economic Impact of the Achievement Gap in America's Schools, April, 2009,</i><p>then but no longer at<p><a href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/socialsector/achievement_gap_report.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/socialsector/achieveme...</a><p>and<p><i>supporting materials (PDF - 1.0 MB)</i><p>then but no longer at<p><a href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/socialsector/detailed_achievement_gap_findings.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/socialsector/detailed_...</a><p>Cover to cover it is clear that the main concern of this, apparently <i>pro bono</i> effort by some dedicated McKinsey staff members, was to scream that <i>US K-12</i> educational achievement sucks while what they really meant was that <i>US Black K-12</i> educational achievement sucks.  So, that pro bono effort was to <i>save the US Blacks</i>.<p>Throughout the two long PDF files, they omitted any view of the elephant in the room until they gave a glimpse on page 26 of<p><i>supporting materials (PDF - 1.0 MB)</i><p>where they did a little <i>cross-tabulation</i>, that is, started on the main technique in looking for <i>causality</i> in social-economic data.<p>So on page 26 we finally get the US students, White, Latino, and Black, compared separately with students in many other countries in the world.<p>So, wonder of wonders, the ranking goes:<p>Finland<p>Hong Kong<p>Canada<p>Japan<p>Australia<p>US whites<p>Korea<p>Germany<p>United Kingdom<p>Switzerland<p>Ireland<p>Sweden<p>The US Latinos?  Just above Chile.<p>The US Blacks?  A little ahead of Indonesia and Argentina.<p>Is there any question how the US Blacks would do against, say, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Zaire, Zimbabwe?<p>So wonder how US students of Finish descent would do against Finland, Asian descent, against Hong Kong, Canadian descent, against Canada, Japanese descent, against Japan, Australian descent, against Australia?  The study didn't say.  Ah, wonder why?  Why oh why?  Maybe they followed the old rule, ""If you don't think you will like the answer, then don't ask the question."".<p>So the study mostly tried to obscure the obvious <i>cause</i>:  For the data they considered, the main cause of good performance is country of origin.  Right:  In particular, parents are a still more important cause, and it might be possible to dig still deeper.<p>Then the main reason for the low average US ranking is that the US is a diverse country and the other countries are homogeneous.<p>So, Virgina, this <i>statistical pattern</i> has NOTHING to do with education or US education:  Instead, take any 100 homogeneous populations, of anything -- kitty cats, puppy dogs, or billy goats.  Then pick a measure, any nontrivial measure you want from length of hair, body weight, running speed, jumping ability, whisker length, nearly anything at all.  Then from the 100 homogeneous populations, make a diverse population and apply the measure.  Then rank all the 101 populations.  Presto:  Wonder of wonders, the diverse population will be ahead of some of the homogeneous populations and behind some of the others.  Obvious.  Trivial.<p>And that obvious, trivial observation is so far ALL the screaming is about.  How 'bout that.<p>So, if want to tar and feather US education, which for other reasons I'm plenty eager to do, will build the fire to warm up the tar right away, then compare US <i>education</i> with apples against apples.  So, compare US education on people from Finland with Finland education on people in Finland.  In this way have compared US <i>education</i> with Finland <i>education</i>. Then rinse, repeat for Hong Kong, Canada, Japan, etc.<p>But the semi-, pseudo-, quasi-smart, partly objective McKinsey team last year and the movie people this year showed their grasp of <i>education</i>:  All they showed was the same thing would see from 101 collections of kitty cats measured on length of whiskers.<p>There's another big point:  Apparently actually there isn't much in K-12 in the public school systems of any of the countries so that at most not much is missed.<p>Another point:  Let's compare college education and, there, GRE scores.  Bet the top 100 US colleges and universities do quite well, thank you.<p>Another point:  Let's compare graduate education and research progress -- as we know, the US by itself totally blows all the rest of the world off the court and out of the arena.<p>Another point:  K-12 really <i>should</i> amount to something.  So let's move to that.<p>Another point:  It may be that the US should take vocational education as seriously as, say, Germany does.  We should consider that.<p>Another point:  In the classic <i>Democracy and Education</i>, John Dewey made a big point:  He defined <i>education</i> as the passing from one generation to the next and mentioned that what gets passed is mostly just what was there, both good and bad, with maybe a little improvement at each passing.  So, without some quite special efforts, tough to take teachers from the middle third of US educational accomplishment and have them pass on only the top 10% of educational content.<p>Another point:  Once again we see that high accomplishment is mostly the responsibility of individuals and where their best help is from their own families.  So, enter the promise of home schooling.<p>Here's my approach to improving US education (listen up billionaires):<p>First, set up <i>educational certification</i> in nearly all subjects of interest from math, physics, and chemistry to auto body repair, grass mowing, all the way down to, say, computer science, and from there way, way down to, say, programming in C++, if could find anyone so weak minded.  The CEEB tests should be a good start.<p>Second, get most colleges to agree on the required subjects to be ready for college work.<p>Third, fund some efforts at educational materials and programs to prepare students for the tests.  Of course should try to make heavy use of PDF files, video lectures on YouTUBE, Web fora, tutoring, etc.<p>Then, let free enterprise take over and develop still better educational materials.<p>For K-12, leave that to local school boards:  Some will <i>get it</i> and let well motivated and guided students just pursue some of the better sets of materials and, then, be ready for college work at age 10 or 12.<p>Then have those 12 year olds compete with 12 year olds around the world.<p>Here we cut out a lot of nonsense:  If someone wants to learn, then sit in a cubicle with a computer, work through some of the best educational materials, take the test, and see how well they do, and then all the credit and/or blame is just theirs.<p>For varsity athletics, f'get about it except for the cheerleaders -- wouldn't want not to have the cheerleaders, a crown jewel of the US educational system!",1285054083

1711817,comment,1711192,1711192,0,0,purpledove,,,"I fail to see how Chris was a ""casualty of the system"". I have a little trouble buying his stated desire to transfer to a vocational school for training mechanics...in any city there are plenty of mechanics around, and you just need a little guts to up to a bunch of them and say ""I want to be a mechanic, please tell me how"". Sooner or later, you're going to get a lead. They may or may not take you on, but I find it difficult to believe that you can't become a mechanic if you show at least some of the signs of being worth an investment in time - maturity, respect, willingness to work hard, motivation, some relevant experience like, say, fixing other things that are less expensive than but share some characteristics with cars, etc...<p>I get the impression that Chris' journal writings have more to do with his gang aspirations than his desire to live an honest life. Gangs are known to deal in stolen cars, and they deal with shady characters who perform a variety of roles to support this illegal business - ripping cars apart, putting together knock-offs, making illegal modifications, and so on. With a little work, I have no doubt Chris will be able to satisfy his love of cars as a gang member.<p>Being a gang member is a high risk / high reward proposition, but it has a variety of perks: money, women, and cars among them. This leaves the issue of morality untouched - clearly gangs are evil and mechanics are good...but you can't teach someone to be good.",1285053976

1711814,comment,1711470,1711768,0,0,jasonjei,,,"I think what houseabsolute is saying has real validity.  As a Chinese American, I've been teased at school for having a last name like ""Hung,"" for speaking a language other than English.  We haven't reached a world blind to color, and the faction on HN has a much better understanding of different cultures, skin colors, etc. than the average white American, especially of those in the South.<p>It's a bit of a catch-22 situation.  People make generalizations, because it's a very human thing to do; when we write code, we make generalizations when developing our algorithms.  And the reason that the White group is at times marginalized is because a large percentage of that group still has a very poor understanding or acceptance of other races. If you go down to Atlanta, Georgia, you will see two worlds: one white (or honorary white, if you're Chinese, for instance), and one non-white.<p>While it's of course in accurate to say that all people in the White subgroup are like this, a significant number have triggered a Bayesian rule that generalizations about White group are made, and the generalizations are usually made about their lack of sensitivity to non-White culture.<p>And there is still hate. My girlfriend, for instance, is Japanese. When she was at UNC Chapel Hill, however, someone pooped in her dorm room and wrote, ""Get out you dirty Jap!""",1285053867

When TubeMote ""wraps"" around the controller page (when the controller page gets loaded up inside TubeMote -- and by the way, TubeMote is itsejf just a web page), it enables it to send messages in real time (except that from the point of view of the developer, they need not be thought of as messages, only function calls that look like they are local).  This means that all web developers are already ""compatible"" with it.  You don't have to learn anything new to leverage the power.",1285053800

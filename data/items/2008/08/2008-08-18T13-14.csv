Apart from being more compact, readable and parseable, it has the added bonus of being a data format, not a method-call-on-the-wire format.",1219067447

279221,comment,278704,278704,0,0,maxklein,,,"Nah it won't. AppJet fails on many levels<p>1. Nobody likes javascript. We use it because it's there, but nobody LIKES it<p>2. A serious lack of sexy. AppJet makes an app that is targeted at hardcore nerds. And then markets it to beginners. Let me tell you somefink - even beginner programmers want to be hardcore. They don't want 'easy' stuff. You want 'quick' or you want 'cool', but not easy.<p>3. No platform with eyeballs and revenue potential<p>4. It's a frickin closed eco-system. Each new framework or way of doing things I learn takes a huge amount of my time and effort. The value of that time and effort to me is MASSIVE. No seriously, this is like me paying you $10.000. If you want me to buy a premium product from you that costs that much, then I want to feel pampered. I want a return on this investment. AppJet has no return! No money, no credibility, no Resume relevant qualifications.<p>5. If AppJet becomes open source, then it needs to offer me a very clear advantage over my current django+python combo. And unless the owners learn how to market to the geeks, this is not going to happen.<p>My conclusion: Your marketing is very wrong. Either sell to nerds or sell to internet marketers. But not this middle ground with no real defined target.",1219067328

(I've never done that in an email validation routine either but I have been thinking about it and wondering if it would be a good idea.)",1219067102

If you put all this time into something only to have it banned, well, thats too big a risk when you need a return to keep yourself in business. Selling something on another platform, like Palm, BB, Android or Symbian is better than selling nothing on the iPhone. The ""I am Rich"" guy didn't lose a lot of time over his app, but some companies put months or years into development. You just can't do that unless you know your app will be accepted.",1219066764

279201,comment,278689,278689,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"I would say no, anything stimulating should go, at least stuff relating to maths and science. Dijkstra said c.s. has as little to do with computers as astronomy does to telescopes. Meaning that computers are an aid to understanding the theory of computation and information, which for Dijstra is properly a branch of maths, and are not an end in themselves, just as telescopes are an aid to understanding the stars, not an end in themselves. Therefore as c.s. may be viewed as a branch of maths and science, it should seem fair to allow posts relating to other branches of math and science too.",1219064764

279199,comment,279139,279196,0,0,mojuba,,,"It is getting spookier with experiments where each photon, say, hits a semi-opaque mirror and chooses a path randomly. The Geneva experiment was doing precisely that:<p><i>You start with an ultraviolet photon and split it into two photons. One goes one way and the other goes another way, both to identical interferometers. Entering its own interferometer, each photon must make a random decision as to whether it will travel a long pathway through the device or a short one. Then you look for a correlation between the pathways taken by the photons in their respective interferometers.</i><p><i>If the timing between the photons is exactly adjusted, each twin seems to know what the other is doing and matches its choice of pathway to coincide with that of its distant partner.</i> (upd)<p>From <a href=""http://www.cebaf.gov/news/internet/1997/spooky.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cebaf.gov/news/internet/1997/spooky.html</a>",1219064470

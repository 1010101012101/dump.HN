That is a weak workaround. There real solution is to fully recognize that information is power, and to have a separation of powers similar to the three powers of Montesquieu's. Hardware companies should no be allowed to make or sell or control software. Software companies should not be allowed to produce, sell or control hardware*<p>One problem is that if that weren't allowed, we'd probably never have the app in the first place...<p>The app was made for THAT platform, for THAT store and for THAT hardware product.<p>Now, one can assume but we would have gotten something like the iPhone eventually anyway, but if you see what the hardware-first companies were shipping at the time of the iPhone's launch, that might have taken 5-10 more years.<p>I don't mean it could only happen by Apple: just that it could only happen by a process of building things where hardware+software are given equal importance, and ONE entity calls the shots for both.",1339685949

When a small country sees a big sector in their economy collapse like Iceland and their banking sector, there's going to be pain no matter which way you slice it.  What the route Iceland has chosen does is spread the pain evenly between retirees who see their savings lose value and workers who see their paychecks love value.  And you avoid the mass unemployment you tend to get through other methods, which further decreases the size of the real economy in a sub-critical positive feedback loop.",1339685917

I would be interested in what are the difficulties when dealing with larger projects.<p>For illustration, here's how I call the openproc() function from libproc:<p><pre><code>    import (

This illustrates one issue I found with Cgo: calling functions with variable number of arguments is not supported.

It also includes the compiler and Cgo directives that make editing a Makefile unnecessary. The code for the whole tool is contained in one Go file.",1339685270

This isn't a simple case of ants and grasshoppers.<p>The current economic problem is a lack of aggregate demand. Too many people are cutting their spending to pay down their debts, which cuts economic activity, which puts more people out of work contributing to the lack of demand, dragging on the economy more, etc.<p>This means that many careful savers are finding themselves in the same boat as the profligate simply because the drop in demand cost them their jobs.  We might judge individuals for not doing more to get new jobs, but market-wide, they can't <i>all</i> try harder and win the few remaining jobs. There simply do not exist enough jobs and some careful savers will unavoidably find themselves in the same boat as careless spenders.<p>Consider an allegorical ant who worked just as diligently as any other, rudely ejected from the ant hill on the onset of winter because the others decided the hill simply didn't need to be as big as it was the day before. This now-homeless ant would suddenly need to dig his own shelter, preventing them from gathering further food, costing them food to the elements and ultimately leaving them in much the same boat as any grasshopper who played the summer away and never stored a thing.  Is it truly fair to judge such an ant no differently than a grasshopper?<p>Also, the <i>cause</i> of this economic problem is largely one of a supposedly-regulated and free-from-fraud industry enjoying regulatory-capture and left to run amok.  Many careful savers are finding themselves in the same boat as the profligate, because they were defrauded by lenders and/or brokers.  Lenders and brokers who are facing no punishment for their crimes. No return to effective regulation to prevent it from happening again. No dissolution to prevent ""too big to fail"" institutions from holding the economy hostage. [1]<p>Consider another allegorical ant who worked all spring summer and fall, as hard as any other, who wakes up one day to find that the food he'd saved has mysteriously disappeared, despite him taking no less precautions than any other, perhaps simply because his pile happened to be protected by an incompetent or possibly corrupt guard who let or helped others steal it away.  And this ant now finds himself being ejected for not having anything to contribute to the hill. Should we also judge this ant no differently than a grasshopper?<p>You are certainly free to cast judgment and aspersions on these formerly-careful-savers for not having years and years worth of living expenses set aside.  And/or for trusting that a protected-from-fraud industry actually <i>was</i>.<p>But it seems to me that they were punished for these things largely by chance -- not everyone who saved as much/little as they, or stored their money in the same ways, or researched as much/little on their investments, woke up to find themselves cast out by society and treated no differently than a degenerate check-to-check gambler.<p>And as such, your moral judgment strikes me as terribly myopic, hollow and false.<p>[1] It's debatable that these fraudsters were even directly rewarded from the bailouts on a far more massive scale than the profligate would be by a few years of modest inflation.<p>If you're concerned about sending a message that people who follow the rules are an idiot, your complaining about modest inflation rather than the bailouts is akin to complaining that a burglar tracked mud through your house while taking your valuables and your insurance policy leaves it up to you to pay for a carpet cleaning.

The problem is that you don't necessarily know which subviews can be held onto and which are no longer needed, so the only way to generically handle the situation is to destroy all subviews when a parent view needs to be rerendered. This sound horrible and inefficient, I know, but our way to deal with it has been to be very careful about what triggers a rerender.<p>Views state exactly which attributes on their model should trigger the rerender when they change, and no others. If you have a very high level view which has a sizeable tree of subviews underneath it, then its subviews will probably be the ones actually displaying data and that it will essentially just be a 'composite' view and will never rerender.<p>Views which bind to collections (eg: Lists) have special logic for adding and removing subviews without rerendering all of them.",1339683836

You simply use the Handlebars helper exactly where you want that view and the rest is taken care of for you.<p>It does indeed look very simple and easy but what I would be concerned about is that you have logic in your views that perhaps shouldn't be there. Your views are now dependent on the template language/parser you are using. Have you tried any other approaches that didn't work so well/easy before coming to this solution?<p>> If a view can only work in a particular situation (eg: nested inside a list which handles its events), then that creates hard dependencies between those two views and you can quickly get into a mess.<p>Agree. But how about having per view instance dependency instead of per view constructor. For example,<p><pre><code>    <div class=""listenNetwork__creator"">
        {{view ""views/user/user-badge"" resource_id=user.id parent_view=this }}
    </div>
</code></pre>
So your user-badge view can bind its events on the parent_view.el (if available), otherwise on itself. Backbone does this in a way on its delegateEvents method. If there is no selector specified in your event it uses bind on this.$el, otherwise it uses this.$el.delegate.<p>Thanks",1339683151

4111393,comment,4110271,4110450,28,0,daeken,,,"For background, I write a <i>lot</i> of WebGL demos, I work for Mozilla on gfx optimizations (WebGL and otherwise) for the Boot2Gecko project.  I also worked at Matasano Security previously, doing WebGL security research.  As such, I tend to think that I'm pretty unbiased in this regard -- or perhaps biased towards WebGL, since I love it and want to see it everywhere.  So with all that said, your characterization of MS's security claims as ""FUD"" are complete and utter bullshit.  WebGL has a substantial attack surface in the browser (large API dealing with many issues from cross-origin restrictions to handling buffer locking and texture sharing, shader verification and translation, not to mention all the code required to actually make this stuff fast, which is what I work on), and it's only the tip of the iceberg that is the 3d stack.<p>Below the browser you have the userland driver components, which do things like further shader verification and initial stages of the compilation, validating index buffers, and simplifying the command stream.  Below that you have the kernel components, which largely trust the userspace to have done their job properly, then do things like compile shaders for the specific hardware and put things into the proper form to send it off to the GPU, as well as handling synchronization and locking and all that.  Then below that, you have a massively complex piece of hardware that under most circumstances is fully able to touch every single bit of your system memory (thanks, DMA), and <i>that</i> doesn't care one bit about security; it assumes that everything coming from the kernel is 100% safe and intentional.  If you tell it to copy memory from point A to B, it will do it without complaining.  Meaning if you wanted to, say, write over kernel memory from a buffer in the browser...<p>So let's look at what needs to happen to get ring0 (kernel mode) access from WebGL: 1) get your payload through/around validation in the browser, using available APIs, 2) get through/around userland validation OR attack the optimization/compilation steps that occur at that layer, 3) potentially attack optimization/compilation steps that happen in the kernel component -- optional, since this layer may not be your target, 4) GPU does your work for you.<p>At most, you're talking 3 layers to compromise.  Compare to real-world vulnerabilities against other parts of the browser (see also: Pinkie Pie) where you're involving dozens of steps, and suddenly this doesn't look too difficult.  The tough part is that it requires a significant amount of domain specific knowledge, but I'm certainly not the only one with it.<p>WebGL, as awesome as it is, <i>is</i> a security risk.  It's one caused primarily by the fact that GPU vendors have never had to care about security along these lines before.  It will be solved eventually, but it's damn sure not solved now.",1339682955

As you already pointed out, it's better for the audience too to read your essays and think carefully about the ideas, rather than react in a linear fashion with the rest of the crowd.<p>Stories, on the other hand, like ""How YC started"" would be much more engaging to hear from you than read. The content of the stories should be interesting enough (""Never a dull moment?""), so that you don't have to make any extra effort to seem interesting.",1332097183
3720530,comment,3719853,3720339,3,0,drawkbox,,,"I think this shows even on teams.  Typically on teams there is a core or 1-2 people that seem to be driving the innovation/product forward.<p>I think it is inherent in our nature to be different and nature lends itself leading to individuals seeing things a different way and getting these ideas/inventions that they share with a group rather than teams creating things solely.<p>For instance Jonathan Ive, you think he would be better at designing with Bob Smith also helping, design by committee?  Products and innovation are individual, production of those products is a team effort. Same with the Woz, Jobs or Bill Gates/Paul Allen, all very individual or core team members or 'lone genuis'es.<p>Creativity is just individual, it can be inspired by external but it really is more individual or unique otherwise those ideas would just be known by the masses and it wouldn't be creative.",1332097173

3720523,comment,3720332,3720332,3,0,gruseom,,,"I've noticed that audiences laugh a lot and that most of what they laugh at is actually not very funny. Most people wouldn't normally laugh at the same things, unless they were really nervous. No doubt social proof is a big part of this: people laugh because others are laughing, as the essay says. Audiences are their own laugh track. But something has to start the ball rolling. I wonder if it's related to authority. The speaker is in an authoritative position, the audience is subordinate. One thing I learned from hypnosis is that most of us are a lot more ready to submit to authority than we seem - far more than we believe we are. If the speaker is known to be famous or powerful, the audience will automatically project this on to them; but even if they aren't, all they have to do is just assume a manner of authority and the audience will automatically project it onto them anyway. Then just about anything they say that is jovial will seem funny and the audience will laugh.  And I bet if an audience laughs a few times, they go away saying ""that was a good talk"".",1332097077

However, I feel like I just assimilated the grammatical rules of the English language, without ever having to do much exercises or making typical grammatical errors that other students made. Once I was past a curtain point I could just read a text with new words in it and subconsciously derive their meaning from the context, without even noticing them. (This can also be annoying from time to time, because sometimes I'd make wrong assumptions about the meaning.)<p>So, I would say I was able to learn English more like a native speaker learns a language. Is this, because I grew up bilingually? Maybe. It is certainly an interesting theory.

In a spectacular about turn just before Christmas last year, it said that the law (the Wire Act) only applied to sports betting. They finally recognised the obvious- it takes some skill to win at poker and blackjack. So when it took action against Bodog, it wasnt for its main activity of online gambling but the relatively smaller one of sports betting.</i><p>From someone who has the unique combination of having been a professional poker player for long periods, as well as having worked at Bodog as a software developer I can tell you two things that are very wrong about this paragraph.<p>1.  There isn't any skill in playing blackjack online.  The only skill component of playing live is in counting cards, and that doesn't translate online because you are getting a ""new deck"" with every hand.<p>2.  Sports betting is far and away the most profitable part of their business.  In fact, their poker room is nothing but a nuisance to them because it allows professional poker players to swoop in and extract money from the sports betters before Bodog is able to extract it.  This is demonstrated by the recent changes to their poker software that make the site very very unattractive to play poker on for any thinking player (ie anonymizing the tables), not to mention their previous rules about limiting the number of tables played at a time.<p>And then the main point of taking action against the site for the minor crime of sports betting, which is ""legal"" in Canada.  I'm not so sure about that, I know when I worked there that it was common knowledge that the founder of the company hadn't stepped foot in Canada since Bodog had launched.  Also, what does it matter if sports betting is the main part of its business or not?  If it's illegal to service US customers with an activity that the US government finds illegal, they are obviously going to take action.<p>Of course I believe online sports betting shouldn't be outlawed, but the US government has always been much more clear about this being illegal when compared to its sometimes wishy-washy stance on poker.",1332095654

He has a relatively quiet voice, and as a result the room stayed quiet enough that you could almost hear a pin drop. When he spoke, everyone listened intently.

3720399,comment,3717715,3719625,4,0,kls,,,"I agree, I think where we went wrong is in these one size fits all type designs. I like OO and events for UI, I feel that it is more powerful than other paradigms like say controller / template. I think black box widgets that respond and emit events and that can be inherited work in a manner that reflects my thought process. For example I always use a select box, where you have the standard select box and via extension or mixing in, you can create a filtering select box that adds the behavior of filtering type ahead. To me this works very well and promoted loose coupling of the interface as well as reusability of components.<p>Once I move past the UI though I really start to feel the burden of OO start to drag me down as far as productivity goes. It requires a lot of organizational overhead to force overtly service based functionality into OO structures, something like getUserList is functional at it's simplest form and should remain so. When working with Java I tend to discard OO by creating static functional classes that acts as a service and util layer. I find that doing so simplifies the architecture of the system and eliminates a lot of spaghetti code that has to be written to deal with making functional logic OO.<p>For that reason I tend to prefer languages that can do both, or that don't force a pattern on you at all, and that leave it up to the library developers to work out patterns. JavaScript despite it warts is a good example of the library developers building out that layer of the language. I also find myself writing more and more back end code in Clojure for that reason, while it is a functional language it does not preclude the ability to write OO code if it is the right pattern for a particular problem set. I like not having to fight the language to break free of the constraint.",1332095436

The fact that some people might get confused by some detail (like your iPhone alarm example) does not change the fact that some some other things are idiotic (like the refresh button). And your take on the refresh problem shows why this whole thing is a complete mess: I'm not suggesting ""universal"" auto-refresh. This is why the browsers is such a failure technologically: people want to try to solve all the problems in the platform instead of just providing simple, powerful primitives. As you recognise we need to restrict scope. The only software that actually works is simple and small. And I'm not just ""admonishing others"". I dropped out of academia and industry and moved into a cheaper neighbourhood to be independent so I can write the simplest software possible. To me that's better than empty talk about ""UX"" and other modernistic double-talk about how hard we've got it. And having an independent perspective, I can see that it's rationalisations all the way down. We will have botnets etc forever until people tackle the problems as a basic level by simple designs that eliminate the problems. But people can't even conceive of putting ethics before their own financial well-being because as an industry we have no ethics. Just pride in spreading our bullshit around as much as possible.<p>If software engineers built bridges we'd make it drive up and down the river, put in a few houses to be ""efficient"". And then when the thing breaks down we'd complain that it's ""too hard"". No shit it's too hard: because we promise more than we can deliver, hiding the risks and problems from the user. Firefox has as a feature in every version the ability for criminals to install rogue programs on your computer. And yet you won't see this in their marketing material. This is a solved problem. We know how to eliminate memory-safety problems, but Mozilla would rather take N years to do their rust rewrite (if it even happens) because it's in their self interest. If we had any ethics as an industry Firefox would come with a warning that it makes it possible to install rogue programs on your computer. But it won't.",1332094025

3720296,comment,3719481,3719894,5,0,akeefer,,,"I'd be curious to hear why you're so anti-IDE:  do you have extensive experience working in Java with a good IDE like IntelliJ?  I've heard this ""IDE's are to help mediocre programmers be mediocre"" argument before, but it's so alien to my experience with IntelliJ (which I've used every day for about 10 years now) that there's nearly no way to reconcile that argument with my personal experience.  When I'm writing C or Javascript, I'm hesitant to, say, rename a method, because finding and fixing all references is a pain.  In IntelliJ, it's trivial.  The end result is that I refactor my Java code much more aggressively than code in a language where I don't have a (good) IDE.  Similarly, while you use the REPL to explore libraries, I use the IDE:  exploring source in a Java project is trivial because every class and method is instantly cross-linked, and my IDE knows where all the code is (including for my libraries).  It's not exactly the same as a REPL (I can't call the method right then, of course, but I'll get to that in a minute), but it serves a different purpose, and your argument in that linked post about how IDEs aren't made to read code is, honestly, laughable:  it's way, way easier to read and explore a Java code base within an IDE than it would be in a text editor and a REPL.  Now, you can argue that Java itself is verbose enough that reading it is painful because of all the boilerplate:  sure, that's a fair point, but it has nothing to do with an IDE.  If you had a language with cleaner syntax <i>and</i> an IDE, that would be better than just a language with cleaner syntax and a REPL when it came to reading code.<p>In addition, it's worth pointing out that many Java programmers use unit tests as a poor-man's REPL; it's not the same, but it serves a similar purpose:  I want to write some code, then execute it to make sure it does what I think.  It's less dynamic, but it has the advantage of leaving you with regression tests, and it does let you explore and quickly iterate your code.  If I'm not sure how to use a library, I'll do exactly what you'd do with a REPL:  I'll write some code to use the library, then write a simple test that executes that code, and then I'll iterate my way to a correct solution.  Again, the integration of the IDE with the unit tests makes running, debugging, and bouncing between the test and the code much easier than it would be in, say, vim/emacs and a terminal.<p>My point is that good programmers in any language find a way to do the sort of iterative evolution and exploration of code that you act like is only possible with a REPL, allowing them to fix errors early.<p>Many of your other points here are good, I just really feel like your ""the REPL is essential"" argument is pretty misguided.",1332093761

It shows you exactly why a language like Ruby is inherently slower than a language like Java.  Mainly, because Ruby does a lot more work to give you the cool, dynamic capabilities that make people like Ruby in the first place.  Of course, much of the cool work on speeding up dynamic languages like Javascript and Ruby is all about analyzing code to find places where you can safely make assumptions about the code (+ is not overridden here, so I can use the built in integer addition operator, etc.).<p>(I probably oversimplified that, but I hope it captures the general idea.)<p>The ""Duby"" language at the end makes me think of Common Lisp and how you can optionally declare types the compiler can use to compile faster code.  Would it be worthwhile to add optional typing to Ruby?",1238770662

Building cars costs significant energy.  The result can easily be more energy consumption.<p>Not to mention that switching doesn't necessarily work.  In most cases, the only realistic alternative to ""big car"" is multiple vehicle even if the big vehicle's capacity goes unused most of the time.  Owning two vehicles, one big for ""those days"" and a small one for the rest of the time is usually more expensive than owning just the big one unless the small one is very cheap.<p>I've posted the arithmetic.  If the big car gets 15-20mpg, the small one has to cost less than $4k even if it gets 50mpg.  (My arithmetic was conservative because I just looked at purchase and gas, which ignore many of the costs associated with a second car.)

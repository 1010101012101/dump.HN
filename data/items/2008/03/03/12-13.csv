128016,comment,127985,127985,0,0,VinzO,,,"The problem is that for a startup in hardware the initial investment will be much more important. If you look only at the development tools (for example : simulation tools) it is already very expensive. And if you don't want to be only a R&D startup, you will have to invest in very expensive production hardware. Maybe the easiest way to start alone is to be a hardware consultant.",1204547997

128013,comment,127711,127711,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"As a hacker and father of four (2 grown now) I've read this thread with interest. What books to read as a new dad?<p>I wouldn't read any books. Or if you must read them, do so with a pinch of salt. Use your instinct. People in books will tell you all sorts of sounds-good things that rarely have any traction in the real world. It's like business tapes and self-help books: they know a bunch of people are out there looking for advice and they're going to pump your head full of something for your twenty bucks whether it works or not.<p>I am going to try to make a simple observation that I hope is not too controversial. For all of those ""I did X,Y, Z and it is so much better"" folks, last I checked humans have been making little replacements for millions of years. These replacements have done all sorts of things like introduce philosophy, conquer sickness, sail the oceans, learn to fly, etc. And I guarantee that none of these hundreds of thousands of exceptional cases ever had a parent that read some special book. Perhaps there is a pattern to how they were raised. If so, that empirical data is long lost to history.<p>So how about this? Try being a human with your kids. Seems to have worked for the rest of history except the last few decades. Might be worth giving it a shot, right? There are plenty of people out there who will read the books for you. Take a look around on this thread. And they will be more than willing to provide you their special ""insight"" on your situation -- complete with guilt trips, moral bromides, and sing-a-long philosophies. You should get used to these folks anyway, because whatever you do they'll still be there providing you with their counsel. Whether you want it or not.",1204547144

From what I've seen and heard hardware startups take a LOT more money and have some major risk.<p>I would really be weary of trying to start a hardware startup.  You have to be a known expert, well connected, and have a good business team on your side.<p>Web startups have an insanely smaller barrier of entry. So if you want to start your own, I would definitely do a web startup.  If you're just going to join one then I guess I would go with whichever idea I was more passionate about.",1204546807

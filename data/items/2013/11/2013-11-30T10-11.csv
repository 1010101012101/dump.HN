I think the idea of a curriculum is quite broken, especially in high school and below. I&#x27;d much rather have a huge list of stuff that will be tested upon university entry and let students learn whatever they want during high school (well ideally I&#x27;d want universities to do 1 on 1s with every entrant) and spend 100% of the time on creating an environment in which learning and exploring what interest you is encouraged.<p>I think the fundamental problem is that most people (including myself) have some assumptions on what a good education is supposed to entail and have a really hard time not trying to &quot;force&quot; kids to learn certain things.

If MOOC&#x27;s carried a fraction of the &quot;academic credibility&quot; that college degrees did, Udacity would be a home run already. This will require a cultural shift, and companies like Udacity are sowing the seeds.<p>As Warren Buffet has said, the courses he took at Wharton barely differed in quality from the ones he took at Nebraska. Our culture is so obsessed with shallow accolades that it is slow to recognize a humongous opportunity right underneath its very nose.<p>There is absolutely no reason that MOOC&#x27;s cannot teach many college-level courses as good as or better than their real life counterparts. Unfortunately, the motivation of students largely stems from the aforementioned shallow accolades.<p>As a filtering mechanism for professional skills, I think the current academic system has some flaws which MOOC addresses nicely, perhaps not as a complete replacement, but a powerful complement. But the reality is, academia should be used to filter academics, and in many industries, a degree represents nothing more than 4 years that could have been spent learning the actual profession and adding value to the economy.",1385808750

IMO, there&#x27;s a plenty of research do be done on how users can seamlessly define allowed data-flows (what the sandboxed application can read and write), and how to implement the allowed data flows.<p>There&#x27;s a fine line between &quot;implementation issues&quot; vs &quot;research topic&quot;. Research can touch other fields than technical, e.g., HCI.<p>As an example, GPG is a powerful system, but all available UIs and &quot;integrations&quot; with existing mail clients are clunky at best. We don&#x27;t know how to create a good crypto UI for GPG. There&#x27;s a research topic.<p>Therefore, even the technically best  sandbox won&#x27;t be used if  it entails a &quot;ton of sysadm work&quot;.

But it is hard to make the case that revenge porn serves the public interest.  It targets the powerless in order to dominate and dehumanize.  Even state surveillance pretends to serve the public interest - Moore and his ilk make no such claim.<p>The Weiner case is an arguable comparison. The character/judgment of a political leader is usually considered a question of public interest.  And voters didn&#x27;t reject him for the images - he was the leading mayoral candidate for a time.

Something that blew my mind back in undergraduate school was tree.h by Niels Provos, [1] which is a complete key/value-type agnostic Red-black Tree [2] in a single header file. Just recently when re-learning C I stumbled upon klib [3] which has a similar take on generic programming by &quot;abusing&quot; the preprocessor.<p>If I am allowed to side-track, I found &quot;C The Hard Way&quot; to be a good resource when re-learning C. I also had a lot of fun with &quot;Expert C Programming&quot;, although it is a bit dated. I highly recommend it once you have a grasp of the language basics. I have heard good things about &quot;21st Century C&quot;, but I am still wondering what other good resources there are out there.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/sys/sys/tree.h?view=markup\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/sys/sys/tree.h?view=mark...</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https://github.com/attractivechaos/klib\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/attractivechaos/klib</a>",1385805912

Check out ""Emperor's new mind"" by roger penrose for a conflicting viewpoint. Both books will teach you <i>much, much</i> more than it's central thesis and is a tour through other important topics in science.<p>Also, you might find the brain science podcast ( <a href=""http://brainsciencpodcast.wordpress.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brainsciencpodcast.wordpress.com</a> ) interesting. She tackles some of these questions also, summarizes current research and interviews other people in the field.",1229698567

Sooner or later this will be the most viable strategy for making money on music. Even if the internet were turned off tomorrow, the continuing presence of rippable media (analog media, if nothing else), the easy availability of ripping tools, the fact that most people can't hear the difference between a really good recording and a merely average one, and the prevalence of terabyte hard drives with ever-falling prices means that sooner or later we will all have the recording industry's entire back catalog stored in our homes. It's just a question of how much time it will take, and whether the primary medium of transmission will be P2P downloading or face-to-face swapping of the contents of physical storage media.<p>Ironically, perhaps the best way to prevent the music lover of the year 2020 from energetically acquiring his or her own private Universal Music Library is to give out reasonably priced universal licenses. Once I know that I don't have to <i>own</i> my own copy of (e.g.) the complete works of Yanni -- that, if I ever feel some strange desire to listen to them, or to force someone else to listen to them, I can always P2P them from NapTorrent 4.0 in three minutes without any additional cost, difficulty, or risk -- I won't actually have to own them. The cloud can take on that task.",1229698540

403361,comment,403280,403280,0,0,tokenadult,,,"An interesting application of game theory to standardized testing. For the record, the single best approach to learning to score better on standardized tests is to read avidly in the language of the test. Here's how I put it in a FAQ message for high school students:<p>READ, READ<p>To learn how to score well on a standardized test reading section, the number one piece of advice is READ, READ, READ, and READ. Read about what you like to know more about. Read things that are fun for you. Find books and magazines about interesting topics and read them. Turn off the TV and read. Put away the video game controller and read. Read hard things, and read easy things. Read a lot.<p>For years, I wondered why it came so readily to mind to write ""READ, READ, READ"" in all capital letters like that when I give advice on this subject, as I have frequent occasion to do. Recently, I reread the section ""Suggestions for Study"" in the front matter of John DeFrancis's book Beginning Chinese Reader, Part I, which I first used to learn Chinese back in 1975. In that section of that book, I found this passage, ""Fluency in reading can only be achieved by extensive practice on all the interrelated aspects of the reading process. To accomplish this we must READ, READ, READ"" (capitalization as in original).<p>Also for the record, the SSAT test used by some secondary schools is not developed by as elaborate a process as the SAT test used for college admission. There is a rather higher likelihood that the SSAT will have poorly constructed questions. But for any entrance test, the first form of effective preparation is to read widely and avidly.",1229698071

(ARM originally stood for Acorn RISC Machine.)

This meant that when the BBC Master 128 came along, with its slightly later 6502 deriative, he could re-write some of it to use the new op-codes, taking less space, and thereby getting in a few more BASIC commands.",1229697362

What does Android offer then?<p>Maybe I'm wrong - we'll see in a couple of years. But looking at things from the perspective of now, Google has bungled this big time. OS Platforms are a market with a lot of money behind it, and the mobile OS market has people with money that can rival googles and a lot more experience.<p>Google can win if the people want Android. And right now, the people don't care.<p>I can match your anecdote with one of my own - a geeky friend of mine wanted to get a new phone.

Almost everything I write is testable and it feels elegant.<p>What are you using for testing? How well does it integrate with Visual Studio, how easy is it to debug a test, and how well does it integrate with your build tools? Silverlight's lack of proper testing environments is one of the biggest strikes I have against it. I'd love to rectify that.",1278701987

1501793,comment,1500595,1500668,0,0,Be_Silly,,,"No in the internet domain or electronic, but Wilhelm Research have epic amounts of data on film longevity, and you can download freely their 800page illustrated history / report book which is awesome. You find out things like Kodak knowingly sold crappy film stock that would fade to uselessness within a few years, which explains why there's so many 70's and 80's vintage movies no-onecan get on DVD, because the originals are spoiled short of painstaking and hugely expensive restoration. Can't remember if this applied to consumer film, but Kodak sure lost their reputation bad, letting Fujifilm grab the market.<p>Side note: the true losses i've experienced of family records were precipitated by ignorant relatives disposing of things they had no right to. My only ever data loss was also caused by carelesness or malice by a third party.<p>As a direct result of this i realy got into learning about everything from backup tape wear to filw system formats, data integrity. I suppose that might be a silver lining, certainly i am able to use what i learned most weeks for work.<p>But my real concern is how little people understand bit-rot and data integrity in general for storage. My view is nothing is yet truly archival quality. One of the things i learned was the way careful movie studios (used to?) separate their color originals into monochrome R,G,B reels, because the mono stock lasts so much longer, doesn't fade. Also i learned about Technicolor, which uses organic dyes which don't fade or hardly fade. But the original technicolor process is no longer used, apparently the last few lab setups were sold to China. I think China maybe got a good deal, and i wonder if we won't see it making a revival? That thought came courtesy of Andy Grove's recent interview where he observes that if we throw the ""low tech"" jobs away to other ambitious countries, eventually they innovate with it, like RCA / Westinghouse televisions and then Sony who then outsoruced to Korea who are the present hib of plasmas / lcds and so on.<p>What i mean is, don't outsource your family records and memories. Write stuff on paper.Print digital picstures on the best current Epson or Canon ink and put them in a dry dark place. Put a lock on it or put it under a attorney managed storage contract so your kids can get access but not throw it away in a fit of upset or stupidity.<p>As for this service, i admit i've not read much on their site, but where is the front and center discussion of how they've addressed the myriad ways data gets lost / corrupted?<p>I looked hard at trying to start a service similar to this, but not with the same angle. No way could i make the numbers work on a ""freemium"" model. Some website outfits do diligent archive style backup for pro photogs, and they charge very serious amounts of money, and i couldn't get any of those on record as to storage policies. It's not just having ZFS, but every app which touches your data better be doing checksums and more, and when i modelled my own idea, i had a 4 - tier multi redundant system that extensively used WORM tape for anything flagged ""archive"". The numbers got hard at the point the equipment his EOL or cumulative MTBF required preventative reinvestment. I was looking hard at trying to find insurance cover so that, should three data centers all fail, i could at least give some financial condolence to customers / cover lawsuits, but never got right at the kind of person who could quote me. I suppose that would be ""cat risk"" and i'd need a big ""RE"" not a front line insurer, but that was only part of my problem. If data is truly private - it might be of a marriage which went wrong and you only want those records to be available after a decent amount of time has passed - you need to build a fairly sensible, but necessarily complex, security model. Then there's the simpler fun of where to store keys, and how do you make any of this easy to use . .<p>I fear that projects like this risk more tears than they solve problems. The obituary thing is just a gimmick. What print paper runs an obit (for real,not as a paid insertion) without someoe caring to contact them and explain why this person was significant. Not only that but the few obits of friends of mine had to be written on a volunteer basis, even for pretty well known people, because the paper (a major national) allocated no budget for that beyond very high profile people.<p>I don't want to simply knock this project, because it's an interesting idea, but i think it's flawed and fragile. I don't want to place trust with a faddish organisation when, heck, i've been burned by trusted family and weak courts and straight up accidents and worst of all, couldn't care less attitudes. Only you care enough to do this. If we all did, maybe family life would get a lot nicer for some of us?<p>Just a thought. Best to all.",1278701950

If you took advantage of the lender, the community would be less cooperative in the future.<p>That no longer being an accurate description of most business deals, individuals are <i>still</i> encouraged to think of legal contracts as being akin to their social/moral 'word' (of honor).  This gives an advantage to the businessman who treats it as a legal contract and nothing more.<p>The individual, once-convinced, will go to great lengths to ensure moral justice, dramatically mitigating the financial risk the businessman agreed to.<p>e.g. the mark is socially pressured to accept increasingly-onerous terms to try and repay a debt he 'swore' to repay; even though the contract clearly stipulates interest as the price of the businessman's risk in the first place.<p>Most people just don't realize their tradition is being used against them.  The rest are encouraging the stigma because they like being paid interest for one risk level, but actually enjoying a much lower real risk.<p>See also: credit counseling and debt restructuring as new legal pre-requisites to filing bankruptcy.  It dramatically lowered risk of lending, without any commensurate decrease in the cost of borrowing.  Yet bankruptcy is still stigmatized as something that only happens to deadbeats and losers.

1501734,comment,1500595,1500595,0,0,grellas,,,"I wonder how this might change the way we remember those long departed.<p>We are a relational by nature as human beings and this means that connections fade with time. Young people by nature tend not to care about the life challenges faced by grandpa and grandma all those many years ago. We make idols of celebrities in our generation but what of the past generation or two. Maybe those of us who are older will well remember a film star out of the 1940s such as Loretta Young but young people don't (and for those who are older, who remembers or cares about Gloria Swanson as a sex goddess of the 1920s, for example). The same can be said of any other type of famous person. Today, some of us remember a few notable things that Ike did, for instance, but as we go back further, say, to William Howard Taft, we remember or care little or nothing about his life and the issues faced by that generation (even more so as we recede further - Franklin Pierce anyone?). Indeed, this is one of the problems of getting older. As our prime fades, and as things move on, fewer and fewer people care about what we did with our life's struggles and we can feel progressively marginalized and isolated as we enter into our 60s, 70s, 80s, etc. Only those who are our contemporaries can reflect upon and appreciate our life's accomplishments as they come to know us and as they share the common experiences with us. In time, of course, people die off and then those who relate to the remaining older people become fewer and fewer until the isolation is nearly complete for someone who lives a really long life. For the most part, immediate family might care but no one else does. For the person who is 100 today, no one cares what it was like to live through Prohibition or to have experienced talkies for the first time, or to wonder at the marvel of air travel that no one had ever seen before or to grow up and raise a family in the rural midwest of long ago. That time has come and gone and we, as a relational people, just can't relate any more.<p>Today, I can look at old photos of my parents (both deceased) and my heart is moved. I can do the same with photos of grandparents whom I actually knew and can relate but with nowhere near the same intensity. But, then, I look at old photos of my great grandparents in the old country from which my parents ultimately emigrated and I feel nothing - it is just some bearded guy posing for a picture in some little hut from a distant land and a distant time.<p>I love the study of history precisely because it helps bring to life how people lived and dealt with the challenges of their generation, no matter how distant from ours. But most of the events of humanity are forever buried in history in a way that they can never be known. Think of all the millions of people from the 1830s, for example, who lived and died while facing many of the same issues we do today - how am I going to make something of myself? how do I find my life's mate? where do I want to live? do I want to go to school and what should I study? how do I try to change my world for the better? For all those lives, the events and the subsequent memories were as vivid as could be as the lives were lived out and as a generation or two that knew those people remembered or were told stories about what they had done. But, given the passage of enough time, none of this matters one whit to those who live today. Now, nearly two centuries later, only a few high points of that era are remembered and often only from a sterile textbook type of memory (important historical ""facts"" in a book) about which few people care.<p>Will a perpetual digital presence on the web change any of this over time? Of course, it can help make vivid the lives of those we knew or directly remember from our lives and those of our contemporaries. It can lessen the ""out of sight, out of mind"" mode of forgetfulness and make us more easily appreciate those whom we knew and loved or respected while they lived. In this sense, the impact can be profound and particularly so concerning those closest to us in life - it is like my being moved by looking at the old photos of my parents, potentially magnified many times over in having been enriched by stories, anecdotes, written memorabilia, etc. not only from immediate family members but also from friends, acquaintances, and others. What a rich treasure trove this might be to help us remember and honor the memory of those to whom we related and all the more so the closer they were to us in life.<p>But what will thousands or millions of such narratives mean to those who live two centuries from today looking back on it all. Yes, it might be a rich vein for historians trying to identify broader trends and issues of our era but does it matter beyond that? In other words, would we even care to remember the stories of millions of persons with whom we are unconnected in every way, even if they were ancestors in our direct family line? I don't know but I would suspect that this would be much like looking at that old photo of my great grandparents in the old country. It might be interesting for a passing glance but nothing more. As relational people, it is hard to relate to those with whom we have no connection (or at least very little connection), and the memories of those lives in this sense would be relevant only for a time, i.e., as long as those who could relate still lived.<p>All this is another way of saying that, in time, the mark we make in this world will inevitably fade. And, for this reason, I doubt that it can be captured by online digital preservation in any way that will prove meaningful beyond the lives of our contemporaries.<p>All that said, this is a beautiful idea and this piece is a thoughtful evocation of its possibilities. It just can't be overstretched to achieve a goal that is, in my view, beyond the limits of human capacity. We can all be memorialized to a point but the limit is bound by those who remember being able to relate to who we were and what we did. At some point, that connection breaks and the memories fade, no matter how well those lives may be documented online.",1278701061

Unfortunately, for now, these ideas seem to live in different worlds: I know of no mainstream OO language that has anything close to the power of algebraic data types and pattern matching that is commonly available in functional programming languages.

I took the entire week off from my day job, so I could work on my startup project.<p>Some background:  My stuff is all open-source, and I'd been working on it under a name that I'd picked out 2+ years ago.

Write a pile of Groovy code, making fixes and tweaks to the actual project.<p>2.

Thus, the USA needs many more agricultural workers.</i><p>And it has more people who could fill those jobs! Funny how that works, isn't it?<p><i>You could get rid of the illegal agricultural labor in the USA, you just would no longer have any fruits or vegetables.</i><p>I wonder how much fruit prices would go up if we were to pay the pickers a fair first-world wage. Let's do some maths!<p>If I buy an apple it costs about $1.60 per lb. That includes the picker's labour, plus the costs of land, pest control, irrigation, transport, the farmer's profit, the retailer's profit, the middleman's profit, and the little sticker that tells me what kind of apple it is.<p>According to this Canadian site: <a href=""http://www.bctree.com/orchards/picking.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bctree.com/orchards/picking.php</a> it looks like an inexperienced picker up there makes about eight bucks an hour, getting paid to fill 800-lb bins at $15.60 per bin. Quick sanity check: that's three pounds of apples per minute, an apple weighs about a third of a pound, so that's nine apples every minute on average. Sounds like a plausible sort of rate.<p>So if pickers are only getting $15.60 for an 800 lb bin, that means that the cost of picking is a mere two cents per pound, for apples that retail for $1.60/lb! So if we were suddenly forced to pay apple pickers $32 an hour instead of $8 an hour it would raise the cost of our apples from $1.60 to $1.66. Or, like, two cents per apple.<p>Hardly sounds like an unreasonable price increase to me.<p>So in conclusion, I think anyone who is claiming that decent wages for farm workers would make agriculture impossible is off their fricking rocker.",1278700096

Therefore I just decided to simply walk away from it.<p>Given that context, I simply cannot understand how people can say it's either immoral or unethical to walk away from a house.  The loan modifications that banks try to shove down your throat are generally shitty deals, they simply want recapitalize all of your late fees and missed payments back into the principle, putting you further underwater.  Working out a more equitable deal with the home retention folks is damn near impossible.  Not to mention all of the collections calls and come ons from unscrupulous firms that want thousands of dollars to try and work out a deal for you.  Walking away is an act of last resort and the financial and credit penalties are there to mitigate it.",1278699402

No modern efficient thread pool implementation dispatching work items is serialized by a single lock, to my knowledge.""<p>Are you talking about thread-safe queues implemented using atomic instructions? Those aren't free - how do you think they're implemented at the hardware level? The main advantage of atomic instructions over locks is removing the possibility of waiting on a preempted thread holding the lock (lock-freedom). They also have lower overhead than making system calls to provide locking. But the equivalent mutual exclusion logic (and contention penalties) just get moved down to the chipset level - now instead of waiting on other threads, you're waiting on other cores/CPUs.<p>""What you ought to have is multiple async accept calls outstanding, and as they complete they are entered into work queues. Worker threads (i.e. the thread pool) pulling work of those queues should steal work from other queues when their own queue is empty.
See e.g. <a href=""http://www.bluebytesoftware.com/blog/2008/09/17/BuildingACus..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bluebytesoftware.com/blog/2008/09/17/BuildingACus...</a><p>That article is horrible. Please do not follow the author's advice.<p>Besides the fact that the code deadlocks (see the first comment on the article), it's also easy to see that if one thread starts generating all the work the ""solution"" is going to become a single global queue (the ""local work stealing queue"" of that thread), with all the other threads looping through the global queue and then all each other's queues just to reach there!<p>The one good thing about that article is that the throughput gains on the toy benchmark (which doesn't deadlock or spawn tasks non-uniformly) nicely illustrate my point about the expense of contention even if using atomic instructions.<p>What the code in the article attempts to do is alleviate contention by partitioning the tasks among several queues. The problem is that if the work is not distributed uniformly among the queues, some threads will be left idle. The way to overcome that is to fake a global queue by having some way to synchronize the partitioned queues. The optimal solution to how to do this depends not only on the particular system you're running on, but also the pattern of work spawning by the application. And all this depends on being deadlock-free (something not managed by the article)!<p>Why would you ever go through something so horrible for an HTTP server?

1501589,comment,1500872,1500872,0,0,amohr,,,"Having recently left a farm job, (tonsillitis brought a premature end to my tenure) I figure maybe I'll share a bit of my insight on the situation.<p>First off, the farm I worked on was fully organic, so there was a ton of work to do, and to do the work we had 6 residents, in addition to a series of day laborers to do it. I was a resident, but the latter is what I think the campaign is endorsing.  We had ~12 acres of produce in fields/greenhouses and a commercial kitchen.  We ran a CSA program, sold to small coops and independent grocers, and set up at farmers market - total gross was around 600,000, growing at around 50%/yr (estimated max production was about 1.2 million gross)<p>Not all that information was necessary, but it's kind of interesting.<p>The obvious thing keeping people from working on a farm is the work.  There's not a lot of beating around the bush there - it's hard work, you're out in the sun, it gets up above 100 REALLY easily in the greenhouses and occasionally in the fields, there's a lot of bending over and kneeling down - which I think we are becoming worse at as a species, and it can get really dirty.<p>Complaining about any of those obvious things, will get you branded a whiner - and farmers HATE whiners.  One whiner can destroy an entire day's labor.  I'm not even close to kidding - a negative work attitude is a problem in most places, but in a situation like this, it's absolutely toxic.  Whiners on our farm rarely came back after lunch either by their own volition or strong suggestion (it usually didn't take much.)<p>Which brings me to my next point:  it's surprisingly easy, at least in my experience, to get fired from farm labor. (no, I didn't get fired)  Farms need labor, but they generally run on really tight margins and can't afford to lose money on unproductive labor.<p>Unfortunately, another thing that consistently leads to unproductive labor is something I tend to do a lot of - talking.  I arrived in rural Wisconsin eager to find out people's life stories (which I assumed were going to be more interesting than many proved to be) only to find out that, for the 10+ hours a day we were working, I was pretty much barred from talking.  Due to my residency, I was allowed a little more leeway with this than the day laborers, but sometimes I would be having a great conversation with one of them without thinking about it and they would get fired at lunch. (I felt really bad about that)<p>But the work on a farm can be incredibly rewarding - it's work that you can look back on and think you really accomplished something.  Not to mention a strong sense of connection to the food chain which I think is sorely lacking (to our serious detriment) in modern society.  I would recommend it, but there's one more thing that could be an issue for the average starting in this line of work:  safety.<p>Many of us grew up in absurdly safe environments with anything of any particular risk or danger generally abstracted out of our realm of awareness or relegated to a distant location.  Mike Rowe had a fantastic bit about this in his presentation to the Future Farmers of America. His speech, on the whole, was similar to his TED talk in some ways, but he drove it home with a slightly different point.  He (to uproarious applause) suggested ""Maybe OSHA doesn't have it right; maybe PETA doesn't have it right..."" He went on to suggest something that I kept in my mind every single time I started up a roto tiller or rode around on a fully extended forklift fastening parts of a greenhouse:<p>""The second you think somebody else cares more about your safety than you do... you're in trouble""<p>The best part is, you can substitute in other things for safety too. (success, future, children, equipment, code, etc)  But this is what we have a hard time with in our culture.  People don't want you to get hurt, but on a farm, there's not usually a guy whose job it is to go around making sure everyone is safe - it's everyone's own job.  You may not think it, but this can be very frightening.  And it extends into quality of work - if you're only doing a good job so someone will come by and say ""man, you did such a great job weeding that onion patch for 9 hours"" you're going to be even more disappointed than you were when you found out you were going to have to weed the onion patch for nine hours.<p>I guess I'll call it here, as this is getting out of hand, but don't be so quick to call the unemployed wimps - it's insanely difficult work (gets better after a week or so) and it's a very daunting lifestyle that most comfortably employed people would similarly poopoo.<p>Also, there's a surprising amount of paperwork involved in farming (especially organic certification) and I've been brainstorming a way to use technology to alleviate some of that burden - if you're interested, email's in my profile.",1278698964

""Currently, ""hacker"" is used in two main ways, one pejorative and one complimentary. The pejorative, main-stream definition can be summed up as: a computer criminal. The complimentary definition is harder to define, but something like this: basically, a hacker is a curious person that repurposes stuff, often in a playful or clever or creative way; stretching some-thing’s capabilities in a new direction it wasn’t designed for.""<p>video:

1054514,comment,1054244,1054364,0,0,sunny_s,,,"I thought as much. But being the perfectionist that he is, Aamir Khan(Rancho), the lead actor has ensured that nothing seems fake or too unreal, for example the scene where he carries out the delivery of a new-born with help from a surgeon over webcam is quite well shot. When he's told that a vacuum pump will be required to get the baby out safely, he uses a vacuum cleaner, controls it's pressure by mounting a pressure gauge in between and uses his photographer friend's equipment cleaning nozzle as the tip of the pump. I thought it was a brilliant hack. The lead character is as close to a hacker as it can get, and best of all he's not called a hacker even once in the film, it is not a poor stereotype you see in hollywood films. My guess is that the director just made the character to suit his film but by mere accident he's managed to get a very good portrayal of a hacker.<p>After I watched the movie, I could relate so much to Rancho, except for he always complained about the education system, but still stuck on and also topped his class whereas I chose to drop out. Engineering colleges in India are very much like a rat race. My neighbour took an year off after high school just to prepare for cracking the IIT entrance exam. He didn't manage, and is now on the verge of completing his engineering degree from an above average college. I just met him yesterday almost after 2 yrs. and he told me that while he's managed to get this far, he has no clue of what he wants to do with his life, he said he always did what all his peers were doing, what his seniors said he should be doing, without having interest in any of it. And now he's stuck. He doesn't whether to get a job or do an MBA. Now I see him preparing for entrance exams for B-schools just the way he did for IIT's 5 years back. He's finished one rat race and about to get into another one!<p>OTOH, I enrolled in distance learning program after I dropped out of engineering and spend most of my time self learning and experimenting. I know what I wanna do with my life and am not confused.<p>But there is a social stigma at play here, my parents never know what to tell friends and family about what their son is doing, whereas my friend is a ""well-educated, hard-working engineer"" in the eyes of everybody who has done his parents proud.",1263544884

I have not thought of this angle!<p>I think it is important, however, to note that a hacker, the way the word is usually understood, is necessarily part engineer, part craftsman, not just an artist (and, frankly, not necessarily that much of an artist at all). In his book <i>Coders at work</i>, in which Peter Seibel interviewed a number of prominent coders (really, hackers of software), and one of the question he asked all of them was if they thought of themselves as artists, scientists, engineers, craftsmen, etc. Answers varied, but in general they suggested a mix.<p>Thanks again for an interesting approach.",1263543856

1054493,comment,1053059,1053163,0,0,phaedrus,,,"Actually your question perfectly illustrates the limitations of thinking of this as a computation device:  I doubt it could be used to find the longest path, for the reason that whatever way the oil droplet responds at one intersection, it will employ the same type of response at the next.<p>The oil droplet is able to (usually) find the shortest path by always moving in the direction of higher acid content.  Would you expect it to find the longest path by always going away from the higher acid content?  That's wrong; that's not the longest path to the exit, it's the SHORTEST path back to the entrance!<p>OK, so how about the least acidic path that it hasn't already taken; i.e. not allow it to double back?  Also wrong:  that will lead it into the first blind alley that faces away from the exit, where it will be trapped.<p>So given that 1.  We cannot use the highest acidic value as a criterion and 2. We cannot use the lowest acidic value as a criterion and 3.  We cannot use the lowest acidic value not already visited, that leaves us with expecting the droplet to neither always take the most acidic exit from an intersection nor the least acidic.  However, surely SOMETIMES the least acidic exit might be the longer path, and SOMETIMES the most acidic exit is.  Then we are forced to conclude that the droplet must act differently at different times with the same stimulus!<p>That implies it has to maintain some kind of state, or memory.  As the droplet is undifferentiated oil, it seems unlikely that it has a large enough state space to solve the longest path problem.",1263543264

1054487,comment,1054417,1054417,0,0,derefr,,,"Okay, let me say this again in here, because it's more applicable: a hacker is an aesthete. No more, no less. That's where both the positive <i>and</i> the negative connotations of a ""hack"" come from--hackers judge things on their beauty/elegance/cleverness/Quality/whatever other term you want to use for an aesthetic scale, <i>not</i> on their moral or ethical worth/utility. Both the amateur crackers who break into systems for fun, and the FOSS writers, are ""hackers"" in the truest sense of the word, because they're both doing things that appeal to their aesthetic senses.<p>Of course, <i>artists</i> are also, by and large, aesthetes. The differences between ""hacker"" and ""artist"" are sort of fuzzy, really: hackers don't necessarily create, while artists are usually expected to; artists usually specialize in a given form or medium, while hackers aren't expected to—in fact, a hacker is usually interested in as many forms of aesthetic expression as they can get their hands on (although, for some reason, they usually don't like the fine arts—this is probably more to do with the connotations of fine art and its relationship to intelligence in Western culture than anything else.) More precisely, though, a hacker is mostly interested in <i>new</i> forms of aesthetic expression, where the ""classics"" haven't yet solidified and there's no canon skills or methods required before one may dive in. da Vinci would be both a hacker and an artist in his own period, but brought forward to today he would merely be the latter.<p>""Hacker"" could be replaced in this day and age with ""aesthete"" and lose almost none of its meaning (or ""neophile aesthete"" and lose none at all.)",1263542592

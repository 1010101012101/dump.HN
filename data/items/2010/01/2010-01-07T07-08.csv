1036707,comment,1036251,1036320,0,0,axod,,,"This is a slight exaggeration (IMHO).<p>I've had one issue as far as I remember. Once one of my adgroups got suspended since it contained a copyrighted word. I called (Yes called) the support number in Ireland, and spoke to a real Google employee (My account manager), who knew exactly what was going on, and discussed with them. They looked up my account, advised me about options, and why it had been suspended and knew exactly what they were talking about.<p>Maybe it's different depending on if you're in Europe/US. The Ireland support has been great. The other time I needed to call was when Google accidentally suspended my whole Google account. It took a few days, but they got it sorted eventually.<p>The example is also a little extreme - I currently pay 5c for a click on average. So if I was that Goog employee, I'd be getting 20 clicks/day - not great, but valid statistically to draw some conclusions. Not everyone is paying 88c/click.<p>It's really easy to beat up Google and complain. I'm pretty impressed they give their employees anything like this to play with.",1262851034

There are two queues: the edit queue and the voting queue.  You are expected to put your article in the edit queue and deal with community feedback for about 24 hours before moving the article to the voting queue.  Your ability to satisfy the community often went a long way toward whether or not you were voted up or down.  If your article made a certain threshold of votes (or votes plus sufficient conversation) it was posted, if not it was dumped.<p>Poor moderation and poor adminship killed the site.  There were no (permanent) negative consequences for bad behavior, since a dupe account could just be made, and if it was banned it was no big deal.  There were also no real benefits for good behavior.

As long as you trust the goodwill of people, you believe that those who want to use your work will pay full price for it.<p>But when you give everyone the right to redistribute, for any cost they choose, I feel that might jeopardize potential sales.<p>For example, a friend of mine wrote an image processing application with a very niche and important application. He wanted to sell it for $200 a copy, lower than what most commercial tools for the same functionality cost. He also wanted to release it as open source/free software.<p>However, if anyone bought a copy of his software, that person could legally redistribute for free or for a very low cost, say $10. If this person's publicity is better, he/she'll get more sales for a tool he didn't even write. And someone who isn't endowed with a large enough budget would love to get the software from a legally clean channel.<p>And yes, it even results in atrocities like this - <a href=""http://cgi.ebay.com/Audacity-1-2-6-audio-editor-computer-software_W0QQitemZ280446402896QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item414be88150"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cgi.ebay.com/Audacity-1-2-6-audio-editor-computer-sof...</a> .

Instead of a DSL hacking around the existing syntax (e.g. in Ruby), you're able to define anything you want, within the bounds of the parser (which, in my case, is very freeform, a la Lisps).  It also means that a new implementation is effectively just compiling a small subset of the language, then the rest of it comes along for the ride, due to the macros.  This is similar to the way that Scheme is defined as a large set of functionality atop a small bit that's implementation-specific.",1262849373

My group found a local organization who was interested in using the software we had in mind after and they served as our ""client"". So, if you have any ideas you'd personally like to work on, perhaps you could take that approach.<p>Since then I've been the client for student groups as well; we had a student group last semester work on an experimental component of the software I wrote when I took the class. Having served in both roles (student and client) I have a good bit of advice on strategies for this type of course (hint: it's totally different than any other group project and most personal projects you've likely done), but it doesn't really belong here.

This changes once you release though. Configuration files are meant to be user-edited as part of standard functionality, program code is not. Your users expect nothing major to break if there is a syntax error in the config file. Does that make your entire program crash with an undecipherable (to someone unfamiliar with the language or programming in general) error? You want to be as robust as possible when reading user-editable files, and directly executing them as code could cause problems. There is also the security and stability issue associated with encouraging users to enter code into a config file. Do think about it. This, to me, is the main reason for treating data as separate from code. You have to be robust about parsing data, your compiler has to be robust about parsing code.",1262848996

1036665,story,,,14,19,daeken,"Poll: Operator Precedence",,"I've been doing a lot of thinking about operator precedence (and the lack thereof) in highly programmable languages.  When the entire language is defined via macros (all user-facing constructs and operators), it becomes very difficult to parse code using operator precedence.  You have to defer the grouping of operands until well after the actual parse-time.  In addition, you could have the same operator with different precedence depending on the macros in scope.<p>To alleviate these issues, I've been considering doing away with operator precedence entirely, and making everything left-to-right (with parentheses and other grouping operators).  My concern is that this could make the language highly undesirable to many developers, so I'd like to get a general feel for how you guys feel about this idea.<p>(Thanks to the people who responded to http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1027796 , where I originally talked briefly about this idea)",1262848414

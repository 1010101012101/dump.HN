Wake up: standard of living isn't a bunch of cheap shit.<p>If instead of people spending $28.73 on a cheap toaster at Wal-Mart every 3 years, they spent $150 on a toaster every 20 years, the cost of labor would become much less of a problem. People are conditioned from birth by marketing and advertising that these cheap pieces of shit are really good deals.<p>There are enough examples of manufacturing companies that have a shred of decency improving their efficiency through process design and intelligence that I don't buy it. But, of course, it's much easier and profitable in the short-term to find some people on the other side of the planet you'll never have to meet. iSupply estimated that it costs $6.50 to assemble the iPhone 3G -- labor, equipment, management, everything.

1479872,comment,1479498,1479639,0,0,alexgartrell,,,"A research project with which I am involved recently moved from google protocol buffers + TCP to thrift RPC, because they found that thrift was much faster.  Google Protocol buffers encode the keys and field types with varints, which are basically series of bytes of arbitrary length to represent ints.  If the 8th bit is set, move on to the next byte.  It's pretty straightforward<p><pre><code>  int parse(uchar *msg) {
    int x = 0;
    do {
      x <<= 7;
      x |= *msg;
    } while(*msg & 0x80);
    return x;
  }
</code></pre>
Thrift, on the other hand, uses vanilla 4-byte ints for the same purpose.  This has the effect of limited the number of fields to 2^29 (I think they use the bottom 3 bits to specify field type, but I don't remember off the top of my head).  On the flip side, it's pretty instant to parse, as opposed to the looping thing.<p>Further, thrift makes it pretty trivial to write a thrift server/client in any language.<p>In short, thrift > protocol buffers.<p>Edit: One caveat -- Async calls WITH return values are more or less a no-go in thrift.",1278035295

He uses a few examples and anecdotes to paint a picture of the wealthy exclusively as bootstrapping individuals that innovate for consumers and create massive value.

Look at the wealthiest individuals and most profitable businesses, they are often not creators of value, but manipulators of markets and mediators of commodities.

IIRC, consumer products are about 18% of a typical household budget.

I'm not impressed with either this article or the preceding one.<p>I've been programming almost exclusively in F# over the last year - but they've been smallish projects. The weird thing about F# is that the code keeps collapsing from huge constructs down to really small pieces.<p>A couple of nits from both of this guy's articles. F# supports multiple inheritance through interfaces, which ain't C++ but it's good enough for government work. F#'s pattern-matching is freaking way far above the simple case he showed there: active patterns, assignment on test, structural-matching, etc. You can do some super cool stuff with F#'s pattern-matching. Hopefully he knew this and it was just an oversight.<p>Also he seems to indicate that MS is going to use F# as an entrance into large-scale scientific-type computing. This may be true, but it is badly misleading. By teaching developers to work with immutable data and functional composition, it opens up the entire PC stack to all sorts of improvements over your average VB code. I expect to see some really neat stuff come out along these lines.",1278033122

Consequently, devices can ""relatively"" easily attach to a tower, if a bunch of circumstances are true.<p>Umts requires mutual authentication, so any devices that will connect must be preconfigured to do so.  This means that attaching to your own tower becomes a lot less simple:  each device must be configured to work with your own cloud.<p>I think it is a dead end because gsm will be phased out eventually.  This is only ""easy"" today because many phones are dual stacked gsm/umts.<p>OpenBTS really started some interesting work in this space, but I think openBSC is the more advanced (and less approachable) soloution.  OpenBSC recently reported some small ability to support a little bit of GPRS.  Without GPRS support, there is no ability to do data on your phoney  tower.

In this town, there are heavy metals in the soil of the school playground.[1] Property values have fallen to next to nothing, which prevents the residents from leaving. And these residents, who were working-class folks in the heyday of the town before all the jobs moved out, and many of whom are Hispanic immigrants who work the surrounding farms and are too scared of the government to raise a fuss, don't have the leverage of Palo Alto's Stanford and Berkeley grads.

It contains 750,000 tons of zinc slag. When it rains, all the heavy metals leach out of the slag.<p>EDIT: I don't mean to minimize the situation in Palo Alto by any means.

Depending on what types of jobs you want, the answers may be different.<p>As some others have mentioned, learning some frameworks and tool combinations are quite helpful.  The Spring and Hibernate combo is probably the most prevalent that you'll see out there.<p>Swing is a pretty rare skill these days, as it's not used by that many.  I saw a mention of JSF in the comments, and that hasn't caught on much either.  If you are looking for the best way to get employed in Java, Spring and Hibernate and the overall CS background is helpful (the books mentioned in this thread are all recommended to most Java pros).  JavaScript should be helpful.<p>As others here recommended, learning another language is also recommended.  I wrote this article recommending to Java pros that they learn a new lang (<a href=""http://jobtipsforgeeks.com/2012/07/11/advice-from-a-jug-leader-learn-a-different-language/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jobtipsforgeeks.com/2012/07/11/advice-from-a-jug-lead...</a>), and I'd still recommend it.

That is, rent and expenses in the city are so high in relation to wages, that missing a single paycheck or being out of work for just one week will result in a family losing their apartment and possibly being homeless.<p>As an outcome of the disparity between incomes and housing costs, low-income families are living 2- and 4- <i>families</i> to an apartment.  40x rent for a 3-bedroom (family) apartment in SF is $120,000 a year - a wage that is more than double the median household income in the US.<p>This is the more pressing of the problems the video addressed, and I think we would benefit more from discussing   solutions for this than we would from wringing our hands about the myriad causes of persistent homelessness.",1365187563

Then you have to factor in that there's just not that much room on the Android home screen, and widgets come in a variety of odd shapes and sizes.<p>Live Tiles are consistent, with only three square (rectangular) sizes to pick from. The fluid scrolling through them (rather than page by page) makes it feel more spacious. I have an entire home page dedicated to Facebook, for example, because the Facebook widget that shows me updates (and only one update at a time) takes up fully half the screen. The weather widget I use takes an entire line of icons, and the calendar widget takes up two columns by three rows. It's like playing a jigsaw puzzle trying to arrange a useful ""live"" home screen. Live Tiles are also visually consistent, which Android widgets are not (my Android home screen looks hideous).<p>A Live Tile is a app shortcut that also acts as a widget by displaying useful information.

I can finally see in a pragmatic way why OOP and MVC are both such a powerful tools!""<p>Not to mention that, since we were working with extending the system, studying that stuff seemed like an essential learning process if we were going to create the system, even if I was only tasked with the ""front-end"" side of templates and visualizing the things from the database.<p>However, the senior guy in charge of creating the functionality to manage products for users thought I was from mars-- his application, which was wholly separate from the Magento install and used a separate database, was patterned around directories, with a set of configuration and include files shoved into the head.<p>He intend me to integrate his functions by shoving his (single, large) functions file into the head of (each of) my template files, and then calling functions to return arrays of information that I could then push into markup.<p>Apparently, this is ""the right and normal"" way to do this stuff in the PHP world, and my process of writing modules, extending existing objects, creating routes to view the data through the framework's template system was all stupidly overcomplex.<p>I learned a lot out of doing that, and the module that I'm building for another client (aMember/Zend) is both smooth and fun because all of the database interactions and template stuff is already in place and just works... and I can focus on the UI Javacript stuff...<p>but I feel really badly for the project owner of the Magento project, as I feel the codebase is... well mostly a bunch of functions in a single file and a bunch of single-form .php files that make SOAP calls and depreciated mysqli_ calls...<p>Now, I dunno-- I'm definitely the less experienced programmer, but if this is the norm in PHP programming (surely it can't be), I will be spending my summer trying to build enough projects in other languages that I can transition out of doing PHP.<p>Sorry for the rant, but it was cathartic for me :D",1365186805

Decriminalization of drugs, more research into how to treat people with mental health issues and addictions, more resources smartly applied to treatment.<p>TLDR; People don't become homeless because of poverty or a regressive tax code, they become and stay destitute because of mental illness and addiction.

Now, I don't think your 6-month time period is the right data point to measure if they are a zombie or not. There are a lot of different reasons why VCs take short investment breaks, and the 6-month period does not allow for that. I think  18 months is more in line, because it allows you to see more of the failed investments and results overall. A zombie VC should be defined with a ratio of failed (money lost) VS. successful (money gained) deals. If they have a lower than average ratio then we can say that their confidence (and the confidence of their bankers) is down, and they are operating in Zombie mode.<p>But I'm probably wrong, because I am a value investor.",1365186533

If you stick to those tools in the Java ecosystem which meet your requirements, you can be incredibly productive.<p>The problem is that the Java world is full of over-engineered solutions which are really targeted at extremely large enterprise applications surrounded by a community of folks who like to menturbate about them. As a startup, you <i>don't need to focus on those solutions</i>. You'll not need 99% of them.<p>However, you can choose bit and pieces. I'm using Vaadin, JPA and Guice and finding it incredibly productive and am able to deliver functionality in far less time than it took me in Rails. I'm not using 90% of the Java EE stack, but it's available to me if/when I need it.<p>Rails was a great thing for the software development world. It drove convention over configuration and caused a lot of the competing technologies to pause and question why things were the way they were. But IMHO, managing the whole Rails stack (rails + coffeescript + css in our case) across a group of people became a chore. YMMV, but the statically-typed nature of Java along with the very capable technology stacks you can assemble have eased our daily jobs tremendously.",1365186471

I've ridden in both a Fisker and a Model S and found the operational difference to be quite noticeable.<p>But the thing that really struck me about this article was the ""design"" question. And I put that in quotes because the guy that designed the Fisker initially was working for Musk and then bailed on him to do their own car. The hubris here was stunning but not atypical of what I see in start ups.<p>The way it works is that a category of product becomes commoditized and then focused on the design aspects. This happened to cars, engines (diesel or gas), suspensions, transmissions, all are complex but pretty well known kinds of technologies. So the people who are the 'stars' at the car company are the designers. They are the people who put people in your particular Taurus shaped car vs Ford's version. The bits underneath are just ""details.""<p>But when your really being disruptive, the ""win"" is how it goes together, the design has to be good but the technology has to be the focus. We saw this once before in the car market when Honda came in and revolutionized the drive train in small cars in the 80's. Originally derided as 'gas powered roller skates' by the driving public, the key was that they could run efficiently on gasoline for long periods of time with less maintenance. Doing that and keeping things light was disruptive, the design of the body around the drive train only came later.<p>My point is that reading this I thought, ""Here is a good example where design doesn't trump disruptive engineering."" and it's important to keep those examples in mind when deciding how much to invest.",1365186223

Call this V<p>Further, if your doing say a simple linear regression, then for every x, you can have an f(x) which is suppose to be an 'estimate' of y. So then for all our given data points, we can find an error, which is basically the distance of y from the fitted line (y-f(x) basically). Then we can take the sum of squares of those errors get what is sometimes called our residual sum of squares. Call this W.<p>The R^2 value is defined as 1 - (R/W). So we can see that for very good fits of data, R^2 will be near 1, and for poor fits of data, R^2 will be near 0.<p>Edit: I guess to throw another bit at you. Often in microeconomics, you assume that as long as you can meet a demand at a certain price, then you will in fact sell however much is demanded at that price. So as an lemonade stand, if there is a demand for 100 cups of lemonade at 50 cents a cup, and you have 100 cups of lemonade and are also willing to sell at 50 cents a cup, then you WILL sell 100 cups.

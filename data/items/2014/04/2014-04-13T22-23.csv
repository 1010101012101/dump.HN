Flask is more of a ground-up approach; you lose some of the benefits of tight integration but gain flexibility.  But, without seeing ways to organize things well in the first place, I could see a newcomer to Flask having trouble assembling the pieces they need appropriately.",1397429990

7583499,comment,7582345,7583073,2,0,wbl,,,"You are correct: I meant 10x the size of xv6 and 5 times that of PolarSSL. I used wc, so comments and blanks count. xv6 implements a multiuser operating system. This is not an easy undertaking by any means, and far more complex than TLS in terms of conditions to satisfy.<p>As for the rest of your comment, I have used OpenBSD on the desktop. I have never found the lack of a webserver running, or anything but sshd to be a hindrance to making a machine on which with a browser I can read papers, bank, listen to music, and program. sshd is of course attackable by anyone: good luck getting in though. Other OS&#x27;s have followed OpenBSD, as do most hardening guides.<p>One of the features OpenSSL has is support for ciphers that long ago have been disabled, together with out-of-date TLS versions such as SSLv2(!). TLS is a specification, with multiple implementations. The specification is of poor quality, the protocol worse, but OpenSSL is in a class by itself, including implementations of national ciphers no one uses.<p>While Frankencerts were an issue, there was no realistic way to turn the two incorrect &quot;OKAY&quot; and the one &quot;NOT OKAY&quot; result of PolarSSL into an attack. You would need a CA to issue a cert with a start time in the future. It also does not take an enormous amount of code to fix this issue.",1397429941

7583450,comment,7581865,7582877,4,0,fzltrp,,,"I recently stumbled on something called &quot;view&quot;, a concept implemented in the Hope language. For those not familiar with it, it let you define bijections between 2 different datatypes, so that one may pattern match a piece of data from one datatype with the other datatype constructors, and one of the examples in the paper was precisely that correspondence between peano numbers and usual (unsigned) integers (well, really, it&#x27;s not quite bijective, given the arch limits on integer representation, but for any purposes we can think of yet, it works). So, the question is: is idris using something like that? Or is there another mechanism? Is it a builtin feature of the language? Do you use the proof system to persuade the language kernel it may translate them back and forth (the &quot;software foundation&quot; book for Coq let the reader build a few proofs about that, though Coq use arbitrary precision numbers iirc))?

7583443,comment,7582653,7583371,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"It&#x27;s unclear whether the slowdown in US/EU real GDP growth is (a) dysfunction of capitalism, due to what you described, or (b) a &quot;cooling&quot; effect as global inequality of nations (as it should) mean-reverts. The good news is that global GDP growth is quite high: about 4% per year and accelerating (faster than exponential, for now). Obviously, there are severe sustainability concerns (such as the need to move away from planet-baking carbon fuels) that must be addressed. But, if we can address those environmental constraints, the global picture is actually pretty positive.<p>Worth investigation, however, is what happened in the U.S. in the 1920s. We got really good at agriculture, quickly (i.e. over the course of a few decades). We did a bad job of distributing the wealth generated by that. Commodity prices plummeted as the 1920s wore on. By 1925, there was an epidemic of rural poverty, but those were boom times for the urban rich, so it wasn&#x27;t called a &quot;depression&quot;. In 1927, the economy grew volatile and by 1928 large companies were starting to sweat. The &quot;official&quot; start of the Great Depression was Oct. 1929, and by 1933, the U.S. economy had imploded and the stock market was down almost 90% from its highs.<p>In the late 1920s, prevailing conservative thought was that poverty was a sort of &quot;moral medicine&quot;, because the suffering washed away sin. (It was the same backward, moralistic thinking as was behind Prohibition.) The Depression proved that it&#x27;s a cancer that spreads relentlessly. If the farmers get poor, the factory workers selling to farmers get poor, and those who have money become risk-averse and hoard it (causing asset crashes) and over time almost everyone ends up losing.<p>What happened to agricultural commodities in the 1920s is happening to <i>nearly all human labor</i> now. And that&#x27;s pretty terrifying.",1397429018

The current services in this industry tend to cost a lot more than this and/or require you to do preparation yourself (i.e., they supply the ingredients only.)

For a microcosm, look at commercial air travel. The experience (especially in the lower classes) is Soviet, but the fare-setting (read: price gouging) is hideously capitalistic.<p>Capitalism generates a set of wealthy people, who pull up the ladder by restricting society to the sorts of capitalism that enhance their wealth, while destroying any variety of business activity that challenges it. That&#x27;s what we see in the VC-funded world. The VCs have enough capital to kill any fledgling business by funding (or creating, this being the purpose of EIRs) a competitor, but their note-sharing and co-funding makes of them a reputation economy that has more in common with the Politburo than a free-market system.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t that capitalism is a bad system. It&#x27;s that, when you don&#x27;t have checks and balances that prevent financial and political power being traded for one another, you end up with a corporatist-statist structure rather than a free market.

While it is true that many people in Japan practically lose their minds with the stress of contemplating perfection or failing to achieve perfection, this is the negative aspect of the mindset. The positive version, the version that drove that hamburger guy to success, is that anything you put your mind to doing, you should do with the intention of aiming for perfection.  that may require years of practice and iterative improvement, but ANY task you decide to do is not worth doing half assed.  I have seen people working in fast food serving water the best way it possibly could be done.  They were not being paid extra for it, there is no tipping.

7583371,comment,7582653,7582653,0,0,firstOrder,,,"Marx&#x27;s argument for the inevitability of extreme wealth disparity and at some point a breakdown in the capitalist system is too long to put here, but I can summarize it somewhat.  A worker is creating wealth - why else would a company employ him?  Let us say he works as a carpenter for a furniture store.  He takes $800 worth of wood, nails etc. every day and through his labor makes it into $1000 worth of desks, cabinets etc.  What happens with that $1000 in sales?  $800 of it goes to buying wood, nails, hammers etc. for the next day.  $200 is left over.  Some goes to wages to the worker who created the wealth, some goes to profit to the company owners.  Let&#x27;s say it is split down the middle, $100 each way.  If the worker works 10 hours a day, he is creating $20 in worth an hour, but only keeping $10 of that.  Or you could say he spends the first five hours a day working for himself, and the next five hours he receives none of his own wealth creation, it is expropriated by the capitalists.<p>What do the capitalists do with their profit?  They invest!  They buy more capital.  They buy capital equipment so that twice as many cabinets and desks can be manufactured in an hour then before.  Now, minus the capital cost, with $2000 worth of desks being made a day, with $1600 of daily costs on materials, and keeping the worker at a wage of $100, the capitalist is making $300 a day once his profits pay off the cost of the capital equipment.  So the capital spending means a flood of new commodities.<p>The question becomes - who buys these new commodities?  The worker is not going to be buying more desks - he is not making any more than he did before.  So then you have &quot;over-production&quot; - too much over-competition, which is not good for capitalists.  Marx believed this, but it is not a notion exclusive to Marx - GE CEO Jack Welch has talked about this, as has Peter Thiel, and others.  So you get a situation where it is perceived there is a demand for cloud services - so EC2, Linode, Rackspace etc. fund massive capital funding and get into a price war with each other, and people can buy more and more for less and less.  There is a ton of capital out there, and demand is not outrageous, so this happens.  The bottom line though is the process of profit to capital to more commodities to more profit to more capital to more commodities can&#x27;t be endless, especially with the consumers wages stagnating.  You can get him to get into credit card debt and home mortgage debt and then pass laws saying he can&#x27;t get out of certain debt and so forth, but this only kicks the can down the road, and makes the inevitable crash worse.<p>This in a nutshell is one of Marx&#x27;s major arguments.  It is in a nutshell - he wrote more than three large books on this which are difficult to summarize.  Replying to thread to argue with one of Marx&#x27;s ideas is fine, replying to this post because you found some hole in my incredibly condensed argument would be silly - I&#x27;m leaving out dozens of caveats which leaves massive holes in my condensed explanation.  I have to leave out those caveats or else I&#x27;d have to write tens of thousands of more words.<p>These are interesting articles, especially the 2008 Marxist interpretation of the financial crisis -<p><a href=""http://monthlyreview.org/2013/03/01/class-war-and-labors-declining-share"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monthlyreview.org/2013/03/01/class-war-and-labors-dec...</a><p><a href=""http://monthlyreview.org/2008/12/01/financial-implosion-and-stagnation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monthlyreview.org/2008/12/01/financial-implosion-and-...</a><p>Even if you disagree with the analysis, the data they point to is, I think, interesting.

One of the problems with heartbleed has been that while you can revoke your cert and mint a new one, browsers don&#x27;t check CRLs so they&#x27;ll continue to trust the old compromised cert.<p>However, I don&#x27;t think X.509 supports the concept of CA certs being limited to signing only subdomains (could be wrong), and you have a large industry that prefers the status quo of you having to pay them for each cert you mint.<p>This ends up with ridiculous things like tying payment to the lifetime of the certificate, which allows for things like &quot;2 year certs&quot;, which are obviously less secure than 2×1 year certs.<p>But having your server roll it&#x27;s cert every 12 hours from a more secure cert elsewhere would be a very nice feature.",1397427466

I think any article that describes SOPA as merely &quot;placin[ing] restrictions on the sale of pirated music and movies&quot; is begging to be criticized, especially here on HN. It makes you wonder what else it gets wrong!<p>On the Post&#x27;s SOPA point: First, it&#x27;s been illegal to sell pirated works since the Copyright Act of 1790, as amended. Second, it&#x27;s been a felony to distribute (as in, not selling but merely sharing) pirated works since the NET Act of 1998. Third, as far as I can tell, Google has no problem with those long-standing restrictions on the sale of pirated music and movies. Fourth, that &quot;restrictions&quot; language mischaracterizes the many unrelated problems with SOPA.<p>I can tell the Post put a lot of work into the article, and it was a good read, even though it buried the lede (Microsoft&#x27;s PAC is larger), made factual errors (companies don&#x27;t donate to PACs), missed a big reason Google was able to reach out to libertarian/conservative groups (it toned down its misguided lobbying for aggressive Net neutrality regs/laws), spent too much time on a conference barely distinguishable from dozens of others (organized by an academic center that had for years publicly disclosed it received funding from Google), and claimed that limiting government surveillance draws &quot;unexpected bedfellows&quot; (left-right pro-4A coalitions linking ACLU and conservatives date back at least 20 years).<p>Disclaimer: I know most of the folks interviewed in this article and spent a decade in DC. Fortunately I&#x27;m now in the SF bay area and doing something rather more productive. :)",1397427466

It seems like it would be possible to use this layer to move all key handling and crypto operations out of the process that was dealing with TLS. Process isolation seems like a much better way of getting this kind of security than weird allocator tricks.",1397426547
7583279,comment,7581184,7581868,1,0,j2kun,,,"> The randomness requirement for DSA is such a huge problem for DSA that it forms the centerpiece of Daniel Bernstein&#x27;s critique of the NIST standards process. This is the bug that broke the PS3.<p>I&#x27;ve been reading about this recently, but I&#x27;m confused. Wasn&#x27;t the PS3 issue that the key was <i>static</i>? That&#x27;s not the opposite of randomized, because there could be a deterministic, yet message-specific scheme for generating the secret key. Or is that known to be unacceptable?<p>> there is concern that the NIST curves are backdoored and should be disfavored and replaced with Curve25519 and curves of similar construction.<p>I&#x27;ve heard the opposite, that the curves are not the problem but the choice of basepoint. E.g. [1] states: &quot;...the vulnerabilities in Dual-EC have precisely nothing to do with the specifics of the NIST standard elliptic curves themselves. The &#x27;back door&#x27; in Dual-EC comes exclusively from the relationship between P and Q -- the latter of which is published only in the Dual-EC specification.&quot;<p>Is it still a matter of dispute whether the curves themselves are suspect? Or is the referenced blog post outdated?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/the-many-flaws-of-dualecdrbg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/the-many-fla...</a>",1397426531

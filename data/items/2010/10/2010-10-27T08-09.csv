All you need to be is more secure (a couple of standard deviations) than the average.

When doing static exercises you are simply pushing until you're stopped by your weakest link, while in range-of-movement, momentum from other muscles can help you cheat on the weak areas, so that even though you expose many angles of contraction, not all of them are always fully contracted. Hence you can end up with spots of underdevelopment.<p>I'm pretty sure static holds also help to counteract the sitting problem, since flexing has a very relaxing effect on stiff muscles - it would follow that flexing them as much as possible is an even better idea!",1288168017

I think a Playstation Phone could have been a big hit if Sony moved quicker. They're just way too late. At best we're going to see some Android games retrofitted with physical button controls and that's just not going to be very exciting. How are they going to convince developers to spend money targeting a non-standard Android platform that will reach so few users? I think the best bet for Sony would be to make Playstation <i>the</i> Android gaming brand. Work with Google to make stock Android the best gaming platform out there, work with handset makers to set some standards for input/GPUs/etc, license the PlayStation brand to Android handset makers, launch a PlayStation Android Store. Let other companies figure out how to get the hardware into people's hands. Does anyone doubt this device will be massively outdated before it even ships?",1288166575

1837726,comment,1837574,1837695,0,0,meinhimmel,,,"Hmm, I like the idea, but I'm curious how you're handling a few things.<p>If an attacker is able to steal your session cookies there's a reliable chance that they're already on your network. Therefore, if they're already on the network, what's to stop an attacker from sending the server their own public key in lieu of the victims or sending the victim a fake server public key. Either way all the data passing between the victim and server would be viewable to an attacker. Also, the server's public key would have to be mutable so couldn't an attacker simply ""correct"" the victim at any point in the transaction all the while missing the initial handshake?<p>Edit: While I think that security around session cookies is important for websites to implement, there is a sharp line where it becomes too much. In this instance, given a perfect implementation of your idea with no legitimate potential for a MITM attack, then it would be far easier to simply strip the protection. Rather than trying to send fake keys around, simply remove the necessary things when the user is connecting to the page. (Think SSLStrip.)",1288166512

In my class, we were taught that science was falsifiable, reproducible, and tentative.<p>I'm no expert, but I've spent a couple of hundred hours on the evidence, both pro and con. And so far, I'm not convinced of any dire calamity awaiting mankind if we don't act radically and immediately. If that's being stupid, then I can go spend some more time learning. At the end of the day, however, the climate is always changing. The question is to what degree is it anthropogenic and whether that's bad, good, or indifferent. Unless we're tying to control the climate to one certain setting (which has never been done), then, like all life before us, we're just along for the ride. If we _are_ trying to control the climate (because we like sea levels the way they are or some such) then that's ridiculously sisyphusian. You could easily call such ideas stupid.",1234871892

I like the idea of being a servant and working with people smarter than me.  Right now I've got a team of 9 people working for me and most of my day is spent dealing with stuff so that they don't have to deal with those things.<p>Yesterday I did IT rubbish all day, and right now I'm fighting HP over what looks like poor support of multicast IP in one of their access points.  These are things that need to get done and it's more effective if I deal with them, than involving the team.  They need to get on with the coding.<p>I'm very happy to be in this position.

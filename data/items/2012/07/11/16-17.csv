So, in addition to the feedback mechanism (which is coming), the driver needs an assurance that the customer will be there when they show up. By asking you for a credit card when you register, we do this a little bit better. With some competitors, even when the customer registers with a credit card, the money first goes to the taxi company, not to the driver. The company deducts a processing fee (often over 10%, 5% in SF), and may hold the money for several days (3 days in SF for some companies, two weeks in other places!).<p>We fix this mess for the driver, and they are incentivized to provide better service because of this. These are interesting times in the ground transportation space, with all the activity from Uber, taxis, and ridesharing folks and there is much debate about regulation.

I spent a good part of the next year struggling to get paid for my work according to the contract we had signed, and it <i>still</i> pops up and irritates me from time to time to this day. (For example, the time when they accidentally overstated my royalty income to the IRS by a factor of 4 was really entertaining.)<p>Later on, I self-published a collection of my blog posts. The experience was the complete opposite. It was fun, the finished product was much better (technical publishers, oddly, appear to have approximately no idea how to create good technical content), and people seem to appreciate it more. I made as much money, if not more, than I would have selling through a traditional publisher. Although volume is considerably lower, my share of the proceeds is <i>vastly</i> higher.<p>I plan to begin a second self-published book (another collection of more recent blog posts) soon. I will only consider working with a traditional publisher again if the only alternative is begging on the streets, and even then I'll have to take a long while to think about which to choose.",1342025687

4230026,comment,4229305,4229305,1,0,willidiots,,,"Carriers realize the value in WiFi - it's present everywhere, cheap to deploy at scale and already exists on most mobile devices. There's precedent for WiFi offload - particularly in dense urban areas - and the industry is moving to support that model even further with Hotspot 2.0 and Passpoint certification.<p>That said, WiFi's not a panacea. Technologically it's subject to interference, the protocols allow for NO control over the handset (at present), and its range is limited. Speaking from experience running several large muni WiFi networks, the protocol does not handle power asymmetry well - your phone's WiFi needs to be roughly as strong as the AP or performance is terrible. Compare this to licensed cellular technologies which can pull in a tiny weak handset signal from miles away.<p>From a business perspective, there's a breakpoint between licensed and unlicensed use - at the point that WiFi's shortcomings have less impact than the cost of deploying licensed spectrum, it gets used. There's plenty of talk about small cells in the industry and I think we'll see a hybrid deployment style emerge over the next few years, with WiFi handling the densest of deployments. Carriers want to offer plentiful data but they want to do it in a way they can control, for good reasons - people are paying them and expecting a service in exchange.<p>From a good-of-all-mankind perspective, what I'd like to see happen is a transition to all-IP on the handset, seamlessly decoupling every feature from the cellular network. Apple showed the potential here with iMessage, which works well if everyone's on an iPhone. SMS and voice themselves need to be carried over IP in a device-independent manner. When I can send an SMS from my Android phone to my iPhone over IP, and call a POTS number over IP, I'm truly carrier-independent and effectively paying them to be a WISP. That gives me (and the market) opportunities to build a service tailored to my needs.",1342025524

An average person spends most of their time at work, where people in capitalist countries have vastly less freedom than in socialist countries (he actually mentioned that in western countries, getting drunk at work is a firing offense, whereas in the People's Republic of Poland it was pretty common practice; I'm not making this up.)

I've worked with an Italian company that was trying to expand their market into the US., and the 6 week summer vacation literally sank any chance of their entrance. They invested millions of dollars, hired a bunch of people in the US (and didn't give the US employees similar vacation to their Italian ones), and were really rolling. In the spring they signed a couple million dollars in deals with distributors. Then July/August rolled around and the parent company went entirely on vacation. You couldn't even get the CEO. Phone calls went unanswered. Orders went unfilled. That literally sank their entrance to the market. A year later, they are effectively done and have lost all of their investment. No one will buy from them.<p>Imagine trying to compete with an American startup company but taking 6 weeks off completely. What happens during that time? I'm all for individual employees taking vacation to avoid burn out - honestly right now I could go for a week off - but shutting down the entire company for multiple weeks in a row puts you at a huge disadvantage. China, Japan, the US, and the BRICS aren't taking 6 week vacations.

Many customers don't.  In particular, the best customers (largely businesses) perceive <i>not even the smallest scintilla of pain</i> from software bills ranging from $20 to $20k per month and the person who'd actually be pushing that button at the business perceives <i>no difference in their personal lives</i> based on what the price is.<p>Additionally, we live in our software, are familiar with all the intricacies, and assume that they matter.  Our customers deal with our software only sporadically, and generally only allow it to distract them from things that matter to the extent it is required to accomplish their goal.  They don't typically go spelunking for hidden options.  They (largely) don't go to CustomersOfFooApp.com to swap hidden secrets about FooApp because <i>customers of FooApp care about FooApp about 1/10000000th as much as the developers of FooApp do</i>.<p>Finally, most people have what you might describe as either a moral compass or a fear of embarrassment which will counsel them that attempting to scam businesses for discounts is not something they want to be doing.

Now, naturally, this would be very difficult - both because the SEC and CFTC both suffer from lack of funding, not being staffed by appropriate experts and being (depending on how you view it) captured.  But it just strikes me that these things should never have been allowed on the market in the first place - especially given, as you rightly point out, that most buyers are not going to have the ability to actually perform the appropriate level of due-diligence.<p>And while you're right that grandma can't go out and buy Abacus, her pension fund could, and therefore it does effect her.<p>I do love the idea of comparing GS to a local car dealer - but I can't remember another business I've ever seen that is so willing to throw their own customers/clients under the bus to make a buck.

I sure as hell wouldn't spend $7500 on vacation (that's over double what I've ever spent for my wife and I).<p>By forcing me to only get the money if I use it for vacation, I <i>will</i> have a better time, and I <i>will</i> relax more, both of which will improve my stress levels, etc.  Also, the fact that they are pushing this into their culture shows that they truly value some sense of work/life balance, which is a big turn on for a company.  So many companies say they want work/life balance, then you see that working <60hr weeks is seen as not pulling your weight.",1342022543

I think there are a lot more than just cult members, fanboys and groupies when you're talking about Apple mobile devices.<p>Sad to see a Kickstarter fail so much. Though people have to take it with a grain of salt with a concept product made by first timers. It seems like no matter the quality you're going to pay a markup on retail (assuming that the products reach retail after the Kickstarter).",1342022540

4229788,comment,4227698,4228077,9,0,fusiongyro,,,"Kay and Ingalls et al. had a very specific vision for personal computing as liberating, and the keys to that vision were full access, full comprehensibility and making no distinction between users and programmers. The market has clearly shown that people would rather not have full access, don't care about comprehending the system and desperately want a firmly regimented distinction between users and programmers.<p>For me personally, the thought of giving up entirely on this vision is repugnant and it's important, even if such systems aren't going to make a grand reappearance anytime soon, to at least make sure that people who care about computing know that they once were. I see that reminding as Kay's primary role. I'm not switching to Pharo for my day-to-day work (in my defense I did try) but I find the philosophy appealing and don't see a compelling <i>philosophical</i> disproof. So it seems to me it could re-emerge someday, and a world built on these ideas will have different tradeoffs, and may be preferable.",1342022469

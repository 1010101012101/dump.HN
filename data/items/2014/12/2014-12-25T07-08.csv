The populace was so well armed that an invasion would have been ridiculous.<p>The U.S. also had the largest economy in the world at the time, a population about the same size as Germany, and had the Atlantic Ocean situated between itself and an invading army.<p>By the 1870s the U.S. had a large iron and steel industry and in less than 20 years later (by 1889) the U.S. was producing more steel than Great Britain.<p>Furthermore, the U.S. had the second largest navy in the world at the end of the Civil War--a navy that was very modern since it was largely composed of new ships built during the war. The U.S. Navy was also the most experienced by far with modern naval combat since they were the first country to use ironclads in battle. Granted the Navy rapidly declined in size after this time period, but given that the buildup happened in only 4 years in the first place, new ships could have been rapidly brought online if a war broke out.<p>The U.S. was also covered in railroads and telegraph lines by this time that they could use to coordinate movements and rapidly deploy troops--this was a huge advantage not available to an invading army.<p>The idea of a European power invading the U.S. after the civil war is definitely laughable.",1419494114

8795697,comment,8795697,8795591,0,0,Pyxl101,,,"Well said. I find it absurd how much local governments interfere with local markets, like with taxis. I see no good reason (that will survive scrutiny with Kant&#x27;s Categorical Imperative) to legislate the number of taxis in a certain area, like with medallions, or charge a high price for them. It&#x27;s effectively corruption and regulatory capture. It&#x27;s anti-competitive and has, by my analysis, no redeeming qualities that could not be accomplished better another way.<p>I don&#x27;t see a reasonable avenue for a company like Uber to change the laws ahead of time. They only have the traction and resources that they do because of their bias for action. A no-name startup petitioning the city to drop their taxi legislation because the model is &quot;wrong&quot; will get nowhere. I don&#x27;t see how Uber could ever have come about with that approach.<p>Additionally, I am also not convinced that Uber&#x27;s model falls under taxi legislation by writing or intent. I do not believe that taxi legislation is attempting to control for the same problems. Taxis pick up random people on the streets, with effectively zero relationship ahead of time, and lots of opportunity for individual consumer ripoff. People who use Uber have established a relationship with the company ahead of time, before they need a ride. They have chosen to use Uber <i>specifically</i>. The same choice and discrimination is not part of hailing a cab on the street. Uber offers a consistent price to people in an area, and its well-known brand has a reputation to which people can associate bad or good experiences: for the company as a whole, through their speech, and for specific drivers, with the ratings system.<p>That said, I do also have concerns about Uber&#x27;s attitude and their intimidating and disruptive tactics toward the press, competitors, etc. They have not comported themselves well enough to deserve the moral high ground, though I will tend to side with them anyway on these legislative issues because taxis are so dysfunctional.",1419490923
8795695,comment,8792279,8795043,0,0,ShaneWilton,,,"My favourite example is probably CRDTs - commutative replicated data types (<a href=""http://pagesperso-systeme.lip6.fr/Marc.Shapiro/papers/RR-6956.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pagesperso-systeme.lip6.fr/Marc.Shapiro/papers/RR-695...</a>)<p>Some researchers a lot smarter than me realized that when you&#x27;re dealing with distributed systems, you&#x27;re able to reliably achieve eventual consistency by structuring your data as a CRDT.<p>The idea is that if operations on your data types are both commutative and idempotent, nodes in a distributed system are able to arbitrary leave and rejoin a network, possibly sending duplicate messages at any point, with eventual consistency still being maintained. Since it doesn&#x27;t matter with what order operations on the data types are performed, and since performing an operation multiple times has no effect on the state, you&#x27;re able to guarantee that all nodes will achieve the same state after applying all pending operations - regardless of the order they&#x27;re performed in.<p>Given the idea of a CRDT then, we know that in designing data types with eventual consistency as a goal, we can gain a lot of power by ensuring that they uphold two properties: idempotence, and commutativity. By examining our needs for that data type further, we&#x27;re able to build up as complicated a structure as required. Do we need an append-only datastore? That&#x27;s a commutative, idempotent monoid.<p>Now you&#x27;re able to go and implement a commutative, idempotent monoid in as naive a fashion as possible. If you ever need to optimize it or swap out a more complicated structure, you&#x27;re guaranteed to end up with a system that has the same semantics, as long as that new implementation forms a commutative, idempotent monoid. As Tel mentioned in another comment, you also end up being able to draw upon all of the laws regarding that structure. It&#x27;s like implementing an interface in Java, but instead of just knowing that the resulting object supports an &quot;append&quot; method, you also know that the resulting object follows all of the other laws that mathematicians have spent the past 4 billion years proving.<p>In practice, this line of thinking usually doesn&#x27;t explicitly show up in my code, but it&#x27;s definitely on my mind while I&#x27;m designing out new systems on a whiteboard. My coworkers might not understand a thing about abstract algebra, but that&#x27;s okay! My goal isn&#x27;t to fill our codebase with mathematical jargon, it&#x27;s to build small, composable interfaces, that document their assumptions, and I&#x27;ve found that through this process I can do that.<p>Category theory is very much like UML in my opinion, in that its use lies in describing systems, rather than implementing them, and I feel like this is the reason so many people are able to proclaim its virtues, while at the same time struggling to point to a specific line of code, and being able to say: &quot;This is why category theory is important!&quot;",1419490870

8795692,comment,8794476,8794476,0,0,derekp7,,,"There&#x27;s a pretty simple solution to this problem.  So lets say that a hotel wants to offer clean reliable wireless to its customers, possibly for a price.  This can&#x27;t be done with unlicensed spectrum, since you can&#x27;t get exclusive access to it.  The answer is to use licensed spectrum for this purpose.<p>The way this could be implemented, is for a wireless equipment manufacture (or consortium) to purchase a chunk of spectrum, that they can control.  Make it an industry standard, so that it gets included in generic client-side wifi chip sets.  Then the manufactures can control the usage of the base stations for this private spectrum, so that it is only available in a commercial setting (i.e., places like Marriott would pay a license fee to the consortium to stand up a base station with the private spectrum).  The only trick here would be getting industry agreement so that the client side would get widely implemented, so that Marriott&#x27;s (and other venue&#x27;s) customers would be likely to have this spectrum available in their client side devices.",1419490805

5819085,comment,5818847,5818847,1,0,fsloth,,,"Yes yes, ""True artists ship"". In general though I would say that you can and should strive both for end-user value and overall systems quality.<p>I agree to a point - the pattern du-jour has little to do with good code. I also agree - to a point - that prototyping should produce results as fast as possible. It's very hard to create something new and novel without rambling prototypes. You need those to feed your intuition on what aspects are critical and what are not.<p>As a general guideline, though, this is horrible advice. Although it depends on the definition of ""ugly"". I would pragmatically define beautiful code as something that is as simple as it can be to implement a useful set of end-user functionality, contains only acyclic dependencies, obeys the key-rule of DNRY (do not repeat yourself), is buildable using a single developer action, is preferably automatically deployed ... and so on and so on.<p>The key metric to beautiful code in my opinion is that the code and it's host system is in every way as simple as it can be. Sometimes you need a few abstraction layers to simplify the total complexity, often you don't.<p>It's not just the code. It's how it integrates with the rest of the world that matters. The integration points can be productivity multipliers for the organization.<p>And, as a developer, you can learn all the time. The better systems you build, the better the next system will be (unless it happens to be the second system where you traditionally must try to implement something horribly baroque). You have to be learning constantly to grow as a developer. You have to consciously strive towards simplicity and elegance, because otherwise you will get stuck. If you accept bad code as ""good enough"" always, I fear you will not grow up to your full potential.",1370350358

It takes a bit more planning up front, specifying the system to be developed in terms of well-understandable and well-documented patterns but this time (and hence money) is not lost. It pays back double during both the initial implementation and maintenance.<p>A well thought out software design takes a lot of tasks off the people who go to implement it. It clearly specifies which parts are to interact and how they can be expected to behave. Therefore it fosters modularity and independent development of modules, which speeds things up and makes maintenance and extending the product easier. And <i>that</i> is what we really want after all. We want to get code and therefore products out quickly, we want to avoid bugs, we want to make sense of the whole thing after a couple of months have passed in order to implement NewFeatureX.<p>There are numerous approaches to this. Object-orientation is just one way to do it and sometimes it's not the best way. After all, all these paradigms and schools of thought are but tools to get the job done and as always, it's a good idea to chose the right tool for the job.<p>The other thing is actual code ""beauty"" (however one may define it), which ultimately means readabilty. This is important too but it highly depends on what people are used to. That's why there're often coding standards for a given project or a company. Everybody gets used to them and no one needs to rethink when reviewing the code of other developers. There's no better or worse there. The only thing of importance is that it shouldn't be possible to pinpoint who exactly wrote a certain piece of code by just looking at it. If it looks like you wrote it, you'll understand it that much easier because it takes all the burden of messing with strange-looking syntax away.<p>The ""just-get-it-done"" approach to software engineering just doesn't work for projects of a certain size. That's probably why we call it ""engineering"" in the first place.",1370350140

5819011,comment,5818847,5818847,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"I had a really great post for this topic about the utility of ugliness in language design. Ocaml provides imperative features but makes them ugly, subtly encouraging a functional approach in most cases. Clojure quite brilliantly makes OOP and heavy Java interop possible but very ugly (because the language's ultimate goal is platform-agnosticism) while making idiomatic Clojure beautiful. Making something ugly is often more powerful than saying ""don't do that"". So ugliness has a real value, and that's what I originally came here to talk about.<p>Then I read the OP, which had to go and ruin that by being wrong.<p>First of all, OOP is not ""beautiful"". Quite the opposite, I find Delegates and Factories and Visitors to be fucking atrocious from an aesthetic perspective. All that stuff is there to make business people think their metaphors apply to code and to give them a sense that they, the ""big picture guys"", have a chance at understanding what's going on. They don't.<p>I've taught. I've designed games. So I understand the importance of aesthetics in any replication process. Making something easy to learn, understand, replicate, use, et al actually comes down to aesthetics. Now, it's <i>a specific kind</i> of aesthetic sense you need. You spend more time on convergent creativity (trimming, simplifying) than on divergence (adornments, gargoyles, ""neat"" advanced features). You should, at least when you start, ship a simple product that people can use rather than a complex one that you (having grown up with the complexity as it emerged) find ""beautiful"". With that I agree. It's better to write straightforward ""boring"" code that works than to apply every programming trick in the book (self-modifying code! three-level syntax quoting!) If the dumb thing works, use it. Complexity will happen on its own, so don't go looking for more.<p>Not paying attention to code aesthetics and simplicity, however, is a recipe for disaster. If your code is going to be read by other people and you write ugly, unmaintainable code, then... well, good luck with that.<p>I don't really mind the substance of what the OP is saying (focus on solving problems rather than writing code) but the presentation is awful.",1370349486

I'll freely admit you don't always get to clean every bit of code and make it pristine, but on the other hand, with only a small amount of effort and perhaps 5ish years experience it becomes pretty easy to pump out clean-<i>ish</i> code at the same rate you can make an utter, total mess, and recover the value of your slightly higher effort in as little as a week or two, a time frame all but the craziest start ups should still be caring about.<p>Being in a hurry may be license to be ""a bit sloppy"", but I think it's a mistake to give yourself license to make a <i>total mess</i>, and use your speed as an excuse. For instance, once you're skilled at programming, and assuming you're using a decent language (another thing your startup should be doing), it's at most only slightly slower to refactor something into a function that copy and paste, and that probably still wins on every level the fourth time you reuse a function like that.

He means almost no Americans on a percentage basis of the total, not all of them.  The linked article was an excellent study of the trees but missed the forest.  The root of the problem is narrowcasting aka local maxima seeking.<p>Example.  Lets say the country initially boots up with 10 million news consumers.  Consumers, you know, like saprophytes, but I digress.  Your individual media co. gets 10% of the consumers.  Boss decides to boost his quarterly executive bonus by tabloid-ing it up a bit.  So the ""older"" woman anchor gets fired and replaced by a perky college cheerleader, if it bleeds it leads, maybe some top ten lists (the equivalent of internet link bait).  Hurray the exec got his bonus because your share increased to 20%.  The bad news is the population, repelled by repulsive infotainment, shrunk to 5 million total.<p>Well, no problem, you've got 20% of the consumers, outta 5 million consumers.  Well, gotta get a bonus somehow.  We can blame the drop in total consumers on the internet or facebook or just guilt trip people or whatever... but we've gotta boost that 20% impact to a higher percentage.  Maybe some B-list celebrity interviews, some lasagna recipes, some onsite ""news"" reporting about the state fair... Woooo Hoooo we're owning the market we went up to 25% of consumers hurray huge bonuses and backslapping for all... well, except for the repellant effect dropping total industry wide audience to only 2 million now.<p>Repeat this cycle a couple times and you end up with worthless American news media that almost no one watches.  95% of the population, literally, won't watch ""the news"" on TV for free, its such garbage.<p>The other ""saw the trees, missed the forest"" moment in the article is mass media is huge corporations owned by huge corporations.  Total lack of diversity.  Only five men in charge of five companies control about 99% of what Americans watch on TV.  What a surprise that a big business propaganda conduit is boring and uninformative.",1370349037

In fact, it became difficult to choose a winning design.<p>You have to stay active during the process. Offering suggestions on what you want to see and what you do not like. The designers usually do exactly as you say. After their initial concept they usually just make minor changes. Comments like ""like this but can you be more creative with this part"" does not usually work.<p>As a startup, I believe it was both cost effective and the best use of our time. Instead of spending time finding a designer with a portfolio we liked and then going back and forth with revisions with them. Almost every revision we requested on 99designs was done within a few hours. I also feel the anonymous process of 99designs prevents wasting time by trying to be too nice with comments.<p>I have not worked with a designer, how many choices are you really going to get before it starts to be uncomfortable as you are wasting both the designers time and yours. Five designs? Ten designs?  With 99designs you might get 20-40 unique designs. It just seems like better chances for success in a short time.",1370348795

Only one in ten patents, or 12% to be exact[1], are given out in compliance with patent law.<p>Imagine if a bank teller had a 88% error rate when giving out loans, thus handing out large sums of money to people who can't repay it. No bank in history would allow such personal to still be employed, or they would go out of businesses thanks to competition in the market. The PTO do not have any competition, so instead we are left dealing with the after effect with 9/10 patents being incorrectly issued for fully 20 years periods. Patent trolls and patent-holding firms would likely not exist, or would at least have extremely smaller effect on the market if PTO actually did their job correctly.<p>[1]In an effort to assert the quality of patent, one can look at the result from reexaminations. Like with code, if it is not tested, its quality is indeterminable. The PTO publish yearly a report for ex parte reexaminations, and during the latest period of 2011/09/30 -> 2012/09/30, the reexamination certificates only gave 12% of all examined patents a pass with all claims intact. This is averaged across all technical fields, as PTO do not have numbers for specific markets. I would guess that software patents will have slightly higher number of faulty patents (~95% of incorrect patents?), but statistics over the IT industry patents doesn't seem to exist.",1370348297

In that 25% almost all iOS users have a consistent screen size, DPI and even OS version. Any changes (think of Retina display in iOS 4), the OS handles transparently. The fragmentation of Android makes it a lot more work to support. Additionally, there's only one store; The App Store. Android has Google Play, Amazon's Store and possibly a dozen more.<p>iOS in my opinion has much richer tools (Xcode, Instruments, Simulator) to develop with too. I should point out as an iOS developer, I don't exactly have extensive knowledge of Android. If there are rich tools to deal with fragmentation in a seamless way, please let me know. I'd be interested to see how it stacks up to developing for iOS.<p>I can only speak anecdotally about iOS vs Android but I'm preparing to launch a startup this summer, we're going to have an iOS app but not an Android app until later this year. The primary reason would be we're extremely limited for time and money and the last thing we need is testing the app on 50 different phones just to find the UI doesn't fit on some of them and the performance is sub-par on some. What a pain. Our testing is conducted entirely on our personal iPhones (2x iPhone 5, 1x iPhone 4) along with the simulator and that works out as completely sufficient. The experience we get in the palm of our hands is guaranteed to be almost identical to potentially millions of users.<p>I can see why there would possibly be a preference.

After all, those who have power often have influence, and those who have influence have a certain kind of power. In fact, however, the two are quite different, even opposites.\nWe can see this by a simple thought-experiment.<p>Imagine you have total power, and then you decide to share it with nine others. You now have one-tenth of the power with which you began. Imagine, by contrast, that you have a certain measure of influence, and now you share it with nine others. How much do you have left? Not less. In fact, more. Initially there was only one of you; now there are ten. Your influence has spread.<p>Power operates by division, influence by multiplication. With power, the more we share, the less we have. With influence, the more we share, the more we have.<p>To paraphrase Shakespeare, The influence we have lives after us; the power is oft interred with our bones.<p>People still contend for power. If only we would realize how narrow its limits are. It is one thing to force people to behave in a certain way; quite another to teach them to see the world differently so that, of their own accord, they act in a new way.<p>The use of power diminishes others; the exercise of influence enlarges them.<p>-Excerpts from http://www.chiefrabbi.org/2013/06/03/covenant-conversation-korach-power-vs-influence/",1370347849

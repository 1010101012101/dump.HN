3036563,comment,3036290,3036290,9,0,sophacles,,,"Tangential to the main point:<p>The OP just learned a valuable lesson in what computers actually do. The single char oops is usually programmers' first insight into what it really means when we say ""computers do exactly what they are told nothing more or less"". This is one of those things we all have had frustrate us to no end. Similar mistakes abound, and are one of the those things that cause a lot of people to give up on the programming thing all together. Here's a real kicker about it: they don't stop with experience, we just get better at noticing them faster.<p>For example about 2 years ago -- 5 years into a programming career and 12 years into programming in general, I had this code give me trouble:<p><pre><code>   // C Code:
   if (test_fails)
     do_crashy_thing();
</code></pre>
So I decided to throw a quick printf in there (the situation was such that learning the debugging tools available to me would take a couple weeks, so printf was my quick solution here).  I should note that I hade been working heavily in python for the preceding 3 months. My code looked like this now:<p><pre><code>   // C Code:
   if (test_fails)
     log(""info about test"");
     do_crashy_thing();
</code></pre>
Which caused my code to crash <i>every time</i> instead of sometimes. C coders will know that multi-statement conditionals need to be wrapped in { } but single statement ones don't. Further python if statements are indent scoped.  The recent python work sort of made me blind to the problem in the code. After 3 days of WTFing, talking to the rubber duck, and so on, I called over a colleague and he pointed out the mistake in something like 40 seconds.  A younger me would have been embarrased, but this just happens in programming.<p>My point is: these things happen, and I'm glad to see a blog post about this, without the demoralization that normally comes with it. I think it should be more openly discussed in tutorials and other newb oriented posts.<p>A few tips for anyone who is experiencing this sort of thing and not sure what to do:<p>Get a rubber duck (or whatever) and start employing the rubber-duck debugging technique: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging</a> it really helps!<p>Be willing to include colleagues early and often. Experienced programmers understand and won't think less of you. Doubly so if you are new. (The will tease you a bit about it, but in that shared experienced bonding way, not in the ""mock the outsider"" way).<p>Realize that as you are chasing the bug by getting down and dirty with other bits of the program, you aren't wasting time, you are most likely fixing other bugs that would have otherwise just manifested later anyway.",1316979559

When you upvote some things but not others, you are pushing those other things down just like if you downvoted (and when you downvote, you're pushing other things up just like if you'd upvoted!). In fact, going down the page the article is on and upvoting every other story is roughly equivalent to a downvote. My sister used to employ this technique to ""downvote"" American Idol contestants she found particularly obnoxious.<p>Downvoting is <i>precisely</i> as valuable as upvoting. They're both ways of saying that some things are more worthy of discussion than other things. The fact that 100 people like something does not make it <i>good</i> or even <i>popular</i>. 100,000 people might think it's an awful topic, or an awful presentation of the topic. If they all agreed on a single article that is better, they could upvote that, but if they just feel the article is particularly bad relative to all other articles, they have no recourse but a mass-upvote, which (besides being burdensome) means they then can't upvote any articles they find especially useful.<p>To illustrate what I'm saying: If we all agreed never to bury an article that somebody voted for, 100 NASCAR fans (an insignificant number both as a percentage of HN users and a percentage of NASCAR fans) could completely transform HN into a NASCAR fansite by bloc-upvoting articles relevant to their interests. That would be a horrible outcome.<p>An article about Jimmie Johnson is less appropriate to HN than all the other articles on the front page right now, and the way people register that opinion is by flagging.",1316979195

Most psych professionals actively endorse the Big Five personality assessment.  Based on trait theory, the Big Five is empirically valid, though somewhat theoretically sparse. Here's the rub, 4/5 Big Five traits correlate very strongly with the Myers-Briggs letters.  E/I to Extroversion, T/F to Agreeably, J/P to Conscientiousness, and S/N, albeit weaker, to Openness.  Myers-Briggs doesn't have a measure of Neuroticism(the fifth Big Five trait). So while the actual type combinations are unscientific, the test is still based on personality distinctions that have been researched and supported by the psych community.<p>Also, personality tests measure tendencies, please don't use exceptions to explain away your personality.

I started a project last year and every night after putting my son to sleep, then I start my project work. Most nights it's from 11pm until 2-3am. Then up at 8am to start my day job. After while, I was used to the 4-5 hrs of nightly sleeps. I tried to separate the day job from the side project. Like others said, set goals for each time you sit down to work. What do you want to accomplish. Slowly but surely you'll get your demo done then beta.
There were times when I was too tire to work or think, I still sat down for an hour or two to fix a few bugs. I made sure each day I do something to get me closer to my goal, which was the beta.
Bottom line is that it won't be easy at first. It's probably the most difficult thing you've ever done. Challenge yourself and push yourself beyond the limit. It gets easier as you get use to your new life/routine. And when you demo product and people start to get it, all the efforts will be well worth it.

Hoare seems relevant:<p>""There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult. It demands the same skill, devotion, insight, and even inspiration as the discovery of the simple physical laws which underlie the complex phenomena of nature.""",1316977466

If you have a US company with servers hosted in the US, acbd an EU citizen uses it, and claims you are breaking their laws, then there its nothing the courts in that country can do to make you abide them.<p>To put it another way, are you worried if your US company breaks Chinese censorship laws? That's illegal in China. Are you worried if your company denies that the Holocaust happened? That's illegal in Germany.<p>You only need to abide by laws in the country you are in. Unless you have a EU server you don't have to abide by EU laws.",1316977464

Makes me a curmudgeon, but hey I'm old and came by it honestly... OBTW, it is otherwise a great read and since it is generic to all Common Lisps, of course it doesn't have the necessary how to start and how to stop---(clisp [if installed] and an eventual (quit)), for those who were wondering :)",1316977242

The copyright owner can adopt a new license for new changes, effectively forking his own work under a more limited license.<p>This has happened to many open source projects. Some examples off the top of my head:<p>- AntiGrain Geometry, a high-quality rasterizer library, switched from LGPL to plain GPL at version 2.5. The previous version has been developed further by other parties than the original author.<p>- Symbian, a smartphone OS that used to be the #1 in marketshare a surprisingly short time ago, was released by Nokia under an Apache license. Once the company gave up on the idea of having the OS developed in the open, they relicensed the code under a far more limiting custom license.",1316977227

That's just a product of focus, determination, and ambition, I think.<p>Once you step out of that tunnel and focus on something else, you can release the frustration you had before and return to the problem with a clear mind and even a totally fresh outlook.<p>The problem doesn't matter as much as your own wellbeing, so there's no point in stressing yourself out over one when there are million other things you could be doing. Such a laid back approach may allow you to be more productive, hence  in that case it would be intuitive.",1316977200

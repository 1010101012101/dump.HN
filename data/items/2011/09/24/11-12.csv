The problem is of course that between my day job and my family there isn't a great deal of time.  So obviously I prioritise and tackle things when I can.  When I start a new project I start doing it with quality and ""doing it right"" foremost in my mind which leads to the next problem. With limited time I find it incresingly difficult to maintain momentum when I hit a ""boring"" spot (usually writing some authentication module - but that is oly one example).  I am then suddenly drawn to the next shiny idea and the current one ends up in the great pile of TODOs that only ever grows.<p>So my question is - are there any recommended books, articles or techniques that outline how to stay focused and push on through or know when to cut your losses or more importantly deciding when it is best just to ditch ""the right approach"" and just hack something out?",1316864984

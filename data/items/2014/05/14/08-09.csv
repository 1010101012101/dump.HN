Yet, as you mentioned them. I think Meme has a higher possibility to get popular ... I have a Glass and while I applaud the engineering skills and the pioneer spirit Google shows, it&#x27;s far away from a commercial product. I don&#x27;t want another device that vibrates when I get an email ... :) Meme on the other hand has real potential in my opinion.",1400057955
7742817,comment,7732513,7738365,1,0,freyfogle,,,"your comments generated a lot of discussion for us here, thanks. Our conclusion: if you build an app (mobile, desktop, whatever) that becomes popular and depends on a third party service, in our case a geocoder, it generates real costs for the thidd party service. So there are three potential groups who can pay the cost<p>a. the third party service provider can just provide service for free. We can&#x27;t, at least not indefinitely.<p>b. the end consumer can somehow be billed by the third party service. Feels complicated, especially as the use of the service may be deep in the internals and behind the scenes of the app. The consumer may well have no idea it is being used<p>c. the application developer can pay. Either directly or via billing the end consumer.<p>Option c. feels like the only sustainable one. Happy to hear your thoughts on it though.",1400057920

I&#x27;ve assess the documentation on Roshi and would like assent or clarification if I&#x27;m wrong.<p>After glossing over the readme of github.com/soundcloud/roshi I came away with the impression that Roshi&#x27;s LWW-element-set implementation does not strictly adhere to the qualities of a CRDT, mainly that operations must be commutative.<p>Roshi documents two uses-cases:<p>If first we apply an add operation to the set, then apply a remove operation with the same tuple, the resulting set will ignore the remove operation:\nA(a,1) R() + remove(a,1) = A(a,1) R()<p>If we apply the remove operation, then next the add operation, the resulting set will ignore the add operation:\nA() R(a,1) + add(a,1)    = A() R(a,1)<p>This means the resulting state of the set depends on the order of operations, which violates the commutative property of CRDTs.<p>As a consequence, if we assume this CRDT is replicated on each redis node in a Roshi cluster, then there is a case (admittedly rare and short-lived) where a Roshi cluster cannot be eventually consistent:<p>Given no more future operations on a set with key K, if,\nnode 1 contains a key K with set A(a,1) R(), and \nnode 2 contains a key K with set A() R(a,1), then the system cannot be eventually consistent.<p>Roshi seems to have implemented a weak form of CRDT, which under rare and short-lived situations impedes eventual consistent.

Interestingly, there is another reason why such a restriction might be useful:<p>There are three popular key arrangements. English/US QWERTY, French AZERTY, and German QWERTZ. Apart from switching around A, W, Y, Z, and most special characters, they are mostly identical.<p>If your goal is to ensure successful password entry even if a user is unexpectedly using an unfamiliar keyboard scheme, all you need to do is replace all instances of A or Q by one value; and all instances of W, Y, Z by another. Or you could, of course, disallow these characters.<p>I hear Facebook had a similar approach to coping with input problems in the early days of mobile access: for each passWord1, three hashes were stored: &quot;PassWord1&quot; (uppercase first letter), &quot;PASSwORD1&quot; (caps lock) and &quot;passWord1&quot; (unchanged). As far as I remember, they didn&#x27;t deal with i18n issues -- or publish the results of their approach.<p>Edit: This would, of course, <i>weaken password security</i> significantly.

For example, you can make inlining decisions on the fly, based on what functions are actually called.<p>Well, for asm.js code the static inlining is already done by LLVM/Emscripten before the code is even shipped, so I&#x27;m not sure how much of a benefit this actually brings in practice—you can only choose to inline functions more aggressively than LLVM already did, not less aggressively. (Might help work around Emscripten&#x27;s outlining pass, however.) You also eat CPU cycles that could be used for the app by doing non-AOT compilation (though, granted, Emscripten apps of today tend to use only one core, so background compilation will fix this on multicore).<p>> (3) Caching compiled code is a good idea for more than just asm.js, no need to make it a special case.<p>No argument there, although it&#x27;s harder to handle the full generality of JavaScript due to the temptation to bake pointers into the jitcode.

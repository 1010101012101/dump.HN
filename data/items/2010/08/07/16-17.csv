1583822,comment,1582582,1583760,0,0,buro9,,,"On the street you're likely to congregate at points where people offer some basic assistance or there is security. This means things like food wagons, shelters, drop-in health centres and places where other homeless hang-out and you can pass a little time.<p>In those places a lot of voluntary help is given, workers chat to you, sometimes you'll even be given some new clothes, but nearly always you get to interact with others.<p>I cannot emphasise how hard being homeless and without a network is. You have no-one to talk to ever except for these people who by necessity you come into contact to. I also cannot emphasise just what happens if you have too much time alone and yet live in fear, hunger and with some problem (mental health, an addiction, etc).<p>Some of the people I knew from the streets wouldn't have survived in a house. They needed their contact as much as they needed their next drink, it was all they had and the only thing that prevented them from losing themselves totally.<p>The isolation from giving them an apartment is that no-one will visit, and if they do then not enough.<p>And the problems they'll have are worse and will go to basics such as hygiene. On the streets they never had to clear litter, pick up dirty clothes, and clean their environment... they would just move on if it was bad enough. In a flat most of the people I knew I believe would've just rotted and allowed the space around them to become full of junk and to also rot.<p>They'd need to be taught how to care for themselves. How to cook safely. How to budget and make money stretch (there is little thought of the future on the street, you spend what you have pretty quick in case you lose it. You wouldn't think of bills and taxes).<p>And to learn those things you'd need them to have sound mental health, alertness, awareness of their surroundings. You'd need to help them to shake off their addictions, and to respect themselves. You'd likely have to counsell them and provide support for mental health problems.<p>And if you achieved all of that. Then they would be devastatingly lonely. They won't have what you take for granted, there are no friends for them to call upon, family to visit, money to go sit and bar and chat. They'd be alone and desperately wanting to rid themselves of that loneliness.<p>In all likelihood they'd go back to the streets where they have contact, interaction and community. Where they didn't have to put in all this effort to care for themselves when apparently that amounts to loneliness and isolation.<p>It takes far more than a roof to stop someone being homeless. Homelessness is a state that encapsulates far more problems than just the lack of a house. To solve it, you need to address all of those problems and not just the lack of a roof.",1281199396

1583818,comment,1583311,1583311,0,0,shawndumas,,,"""When handed a lemon, make lemonade"" is a good motto. ""If it's yellow, make lemonade"" is not. What, then, is the reader to make of this yellow journalism, ""The Curse of Xanadu""? Evocatively written and cunningly constructed, the piece claims to be the final obituary of all the Xanadu veterans and alumni (some 50 of us), particularly of myself, charging falsely (amid a fusillade of personal slurs) that my early work on media design and hypertext was based on technical ""ignorance"" and ""fantasy.""<p>This article is a very nasty piece of work. Nastiness breathes from the commas and drips like Spanish moss from Wolf's fine sentences. Everything in the piece is contrived to promote disapproval rather than understanding. This hatchet job could be a textbook for a course in persuasive writing: every word, every detail has been chosen for its connotations of folly, decay, and despair rather than its accuracy or appropriateness.<p>The inaccuracies begin in the first sentence (there is no Marin Boulevard in Sausalito), but I will not chronicle them here; a partial list can be found at <a href=""http://www.xanadu.com.au/ararat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xanadu.com.au/ararat</a>.<p>Reports of Xanadu's death have been greatly exaggerated. Nowhere did Wolf mention that ""Xanadu"" is my own living trademark, now registered and completely divorced from the software he takes such pains to disparage and misrepresent. This is a negligent, damaging omission of fact. If that software is not finished, I will find another way to achieve transclusive literature and register it under the classical Xanadu trademark.<p>Wolf makes a big, fat technical claim that sure makes us look stupid: ""Even today, the technology to implement a worldwide Xanadu network does not exist."" Why, how silly of us not to notice - well, dang! - how could we have missed it? (Strong vapors indeed must I have exhaled to have intoxicated such able mathematician-generalists as Roger Gregory, Mark Miller, and K. Eric Drexler, superprogrammer/superbusinessman John Walker, and the rest of the Autodesk management.)<p>Since I started in 1960, some type of Xanadu design has always been doable with the technology of any era. That is because ""Xanadu"" has always referred to a specific data service of documents, versions, links, and transclusions - at whatever speed.\nThe Xanadu Operating Company server that Wolf misrepresents is simply a re-addressing box, which translates address positions among virtual documents, versions, links, and transclusions across a distributed, expandable, address space of contents. The box is designed to supply the addresses of the desired pieces to the user's front-end machine, which sends for the pieces and displays them, composited in virtual documents, showing their interconnections and outreaching connections to other materials. (The user's front-end machine functions like Mosaic and Netscape, which I believe were based on our work.)<p>Actual delivery of the pieces is obviously a problem of a different kind, a bandwidth problem, subject to more conventional engineering and computer science. The issue we addressed was addressing itself - virtual addressing in a hypermedia world, in which everything can be reused and recomposited.<p>Wolf seriously garbled the idea of transclusion. To say we planned to have only one copy of anything on the network is ridiculous. There have to be copies - actually instances - throughout the network and on the user's machine. A key problem is how to resolve these many instances into a single virtual object, not troubling the user about their different locations. (Note the problems caused on the Web by making no distinction between a document's identity and its address. The result is mirror sites, et cetera.) Literal copying is not forbidden in a global Xanadu scheme, it is essential; but each copy retains its original identity and ownership as a remote instance. That is the point. The different copies have to be functionally united into one logical identity.<p>With regard to enfilade technology, Wolf willfully ignores our exact and careful distinctions in order to make our intentions and claims appear ridiculous.<p>I would like a knowledgeable and trustworthy third party to examine our original 1970 work, under nondisclosure, and publicly verify the novelty of the work for that time, noting how long thereafter that particular work took to appear in published literature. To the best of my knowledge, it was well over a decade, and I have seen no indication that the later work has been replicated.<p>Perhaps Wolf talked to people who thought I didn't understand computers because I wanted things to be very different, and still do; another person's behavior may seem like ignorance, confusion, or insanity when that person is simply living in another paradigm. But from the beginning of my work, proceeding from a basic understanding of how things were in the computer world, I have wanted them to be different and worked fiercely toward that goal.<p>And of course, those Johnny-come-latelys at Xerox PARC and the Media Lab have treated me as ignorant because my detailed designs and hopes for the media future have almost nothing to do with theirs.<p>My ideas may have been too startling and sweeping for many people, but if those who heard me in the '60s and '70s would examine what I actually said, rather than what they thought they heard, they would be very surprised.\nMost people heard only every other word at best. They heard the thrust and intensity of my vision but not my exact words; what they heard was based on their preconceptions, preoccupations, and levels of awareness at the time. And some were so eager to mishear and put me down that they would mishear and misremember no matter what.<p>I continue to hold exactly to my original vision, that transclusive hypermedia will be the publishing medium of the future, under whatever brand name.<p>There are far more varieties of interactive media than anyone has yet tried; but I believe that open transmedia - unique in power to aid understanding and to solve the copyright issue - represents a vital singularity in the great family of media cosmologies; until this is disproven, I continue to stake my life and career on it. If I am right about the centrality of transclusion to the media of the future, it may all have been worth it, and we will see who understood media design after all.\nThe ferocity and harsh intent of Wolf's statement and his varied and repeated assertions of my incompetence and ignorance, however strange or contorted the charges, require that the magazine back up these accusations.<p>I demand that Wolf, and the editors and publishers of Wired, restate their charges as a testable bill of particulars - open to the judgment of its readership - regarding my inability to delve, ""ignorance of advanced software,"" lack of technical knowledge, and absurd notions; insofar as they may have been material to the clarity, lucidity, grounding, and validity of my work, ideas, and predictions in the '60s and '70s; specifically identifying any technical errors, deficiencies, exaggerations, lacunas, false assumptions, misinterpretations, misunderstandings, shortcomings, fantasies, hallucinations, and absurd notions as they may be able to exhume, anywhere in my designs, predictions, published articles, or recorded speeches; whether leading me to think the wrong thing, or the right thing by mistake, as is so quaintly averred; so that such defects may be subject to public verification or disproof; so that we can settle clearly whether my ideas were free-floating delirium or sound conjecture; whether my continual pursuit of hypermedia represented a ""fantasy"" of ""ignorance"" or a clear deliberate search among possibilities and alternatives to obstruct my media designs; and whether\nI was right for some wrong reasons or whether I was right, period; so that the degree of damage from these remarkable corkscrew accusations can be properly assessed.<p>Wolf calls the general idea that we need freedom and availability of information to avoid disaster a ""very hackerish assumption."" Perhaps. But it is an ideal I believe in, bound up with the ideals I learned from the Pledge of Allegiance in grade school. Ironically, that ideal seemed to be what Wired stood for. Wolf's piece is a perfect example of such a disaster.\nWolf himself is indeed an innovator in electronic media. By combining the word processor and the poison pen, he has created a new electronic literary genre all his own. But to quote him once more, ""In books, television, and radio, the truth is a slave to a good story, and convincing lies are remembered, while dry, factual refutations are forgotten."" Indeed. Well, I say let us remember properly. That is the Xanadu ideal.<p>Theodor Holm Nelson<p>Project Xanadu<p><a href=""http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.09/rants.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.09/rants.html</a>",1281199335

If you rephrase the problem so that B picks after A and you ask the question ""is B likely to pick a larger number than A"" before B picks then the answer should be ""yes"".<p>However, this is another example of being misled in reasoning. But not related to timing. The important revelation is understanding that there's no such thing as a method for generating truly random numbers across the entirety of the positive integers. Since there are infinitely many the probability of picking any one integer is 1/infinity. <i>Any</i> concrete random algorithm for positive integers will be hopelessly biased toward 0 (since it will almost certainly have a maximum value, and thus an infinite number of positive integers above that maximum).

1583762,comment,1582219,1583337,0,0,btilly,,,"> > No probability distribution has been defined for the amount inside an individual envelope<p>> I don't understand this assertion. It seems to me that both envelopes have the trivial distribution:<p>What I mean is that there is no a priori distribution in terms of actual numbers.  What are the odds that the amount in the envelope before you open it is in the range $5 - $500?  We are given no such information.  Before you open the envelope you are given, A is a variable, but not a random variable.  Its possible values ideally would have a uniform distribution on an infinite set, which is mathematically impossible.  There is no such distribution.  (There is an alternate approach which is to claim that that the sum of the two envelopes has an unknown distribution, which creates a distribution for the values of each envelope.  This leads to a very different mathematical idealization of the problem.  But the other distribution, being unknown, is not available to you.  I will trace the reasoning for this through as well.)<p><i>If</i> you open the envelope in front of you, A then becomes becomes a number, and there is indeed now a probability distribution for the contents of the other envelope.  And that distribution is now, as you said<p><pre><code>  P(x=A) = 1/2, P(x=2A) = 1/2, P(x) = 0 for all other x.\n</code></pre>\n(Note, the alternate approach would now assert that the number in the the envelope provides unknown information on whether it is larger.  Therefore the other envelope now has a different unknown distribution that depends on the actual magnitude of A.)<p>But now we arrive at a different point.  Now we have a probability distribution for the other envelope, but our intuition fails for the simple reason that our intuition of the meaning of expected value is based on what happens after repeated opportunities at similar random events.  (Insert the strong law of large numbers, etc.)<p>(The alternate solution finds that the other distribution causes the other envelope, on average over all possible values you could see, to have the same value as your own.  However this is of no obvious direct use.)<p>From the point of view of the standard mathematical idealization, what you guys have been doing is trying to train your intuition to create arbitrary distinctions that avoid conclusions that bother you.  But you're drawing a distinction that doesn't make sense.  If you've opened the envelope and you have $10 sitting there, then A is $10.  Period.  It isn't one of two different numbers, it is the number you see in front of you.  That has now become a provided fact.  At this point you can draw a distribution for the other envelope.  But your intuition about expected value fail.  Why?  Because this scenario, with this set-up, is not something that can become subject to repeated trials.<p>(The alternate approach comes to a different conclusion.  Your intuition, they claim, is thrown by the fact that you do not have the critical information about the actual distribution of the other envelope, and so cannot come up with the correct numbers to decide.  Interestingly in a bizarre twist, it turns out that if you <i>make up</i> a distribution and pretend it is the unknown one, as long as that distribution has some probability of answers falling in every possible range, your decision winds up being right better than half the time.  However how much more you are right depends on the unknown distribution, and is therefore unknown to you.)",1281197361

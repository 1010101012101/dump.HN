Think at least twice before making a rape joke.  If in doubt think of another joke.<p>Generally they are a bad idea and need to be carefully thought about.  You should probably also stick to a few guidelines: the victim of the joke should not be the victim of the rape, it should not be trivialised (this includes inappropriate comparisions and probably the original title), it shouldn't be threatening and it shouldn't blame the victim.  If you are not following these you probably need to think about it ten times and consider different viewpoints on it.  Those more likely to be victims [women, maybe some other subgroups] (or who have actually been victims) have much more leeway.<p>Note that I don't think they should be banned unless there is a seriously threatening, harassing or inciting aspect but that doesn't mean there shouldn't be criticism.<p>I don't think any malice was intended by Notch but I think it fell in the trivialising category and I am glad that he has decided to change it.

Really?<p>It's not so much that Woz is a source of wisdom and insight, it's more that there are few gurus and ""experts"" in computer science (generally a good thing) willing to offer opinions.<p>Woz is in the position of being able to take philosophical positions that people won't be likely to argue with, because of his long incumbency in the field of computer technology.<p>But that's an explanation, not an excuse. In fields that depend on scientific reasoning, there's no justification for accepting the opinions of experts based solely on their position.

Samsung should negotiate reasonable royalty, apple should agree.

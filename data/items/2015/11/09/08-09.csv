But to claim &quot;welcoming the Nazis to rid of Soviets&quot; is just factually wrong.\nWhat is puzzling for me, is that all of this is readily available on the wiki pages of these respective countries.

Java&#x27;s open-world type system is one of its greatest features. To counteract any security holes this may cause, Java has a very strong security model, where each piece of executable code is associated with a security context based on its origin, and what it is allowed to do is restricted by a security policy based on the code&#x27;s domain. In this case, however, no foreign code was directly introduced. It was found to be possible to exploit code already found within the application&#x27;s safe domain (a third-party library).<p>The Java solution is simple: during deserialization of external data, treat execute custom deserialization code as if it was foreign, and execute it within a foreign security context. It&#x27;s best if this was done directly in the JDK code, and I assume a patch will adress this.",1447059008

The burden of proof is on the Copenhagen Interpretation to provide some additional mechanism which <i>destroys</i> the quantum states we don&#x27;t observe.<p>Take, for example, the double slit experiment with a single photon. If we don&#x27;t measure which slit it passes through, it has the pure state which we can describe as (|left> + |right>), and you can solve the equations with space and time to see that |left> and |right> overlap after they diffract past the slits, so you get an interference pattern.<p>If you measure which slit it passes through, the photon&#x27;s states get entanged with the experimental apparatus. For example, |left> is now entanged with the left detector resistering its passing, which causes an electric current to a display, which causes photons to be emitted, which interact with the laboratory, and some of which register on our retinas, which cause our neurons to be in a different state, etc.. So the wavefunction is now:<p><pre><code>    |left, measured-left, brain-saw-apparatus-say-photon-went-left, ...> + |right,...>\n</code></pre>\nThe photon is now thoroughly entanged with the state of our brain and the entire laboratory, so when the photon diffracts after the slit the two states |left,...> and |right,...> no longer overlap and can&#x27;t interfere. It&#x27;s much the same thing as EPR, except rather than (|0> + |1>) getting entangled with a second particle to produce (|0,0> + |1,1>), it gets entangled with all the many degrees of freedom of the laboratory, and our brain, and the entire world. Postulating that if we observe |left, ...> then |right, ...> no longer &quot;exists&quot; is entirely analagous to particle B in EPR &quot;observing&quot; that if it is in the state |0,0> then |1,1> no longer exists.",1447058750

This is a legalistic approach not anymore convincing than attempts to define waterboarding as &quot;not torture&quot;.<p>Torture is used in the armed conflicts depressingly regularly: the corresponding clauses in Geneva Conventions for treatment of POW were added not for purely theoretic reasons. Torture is used by criminals around the world on daily basis. The reason they haven&#x27;t given up after millenia of practice is that it tends to work in their unsophisticated, easily verifiable cases: getting the combination to a safe or finding where a merchant keeps their money stashed.<p>Anyway, torture should not be used because it&#x27;s simply an abhorrent thing to do to a human being.

The economics of things, mostly.<p>At my previous job, we were still in process to get session migration to work so servers within a cluster could update while others were running.<p>At my current job, we don't have a cluster (we have a single over-provisioned server), and that method simply isn't in the budget for the foreseeable future.  However, 3:00 AM PDT is 3:30 PM IST (India), which is where most of my team is, as well as the support staff they need (most staff there are on swing shift, as well).  Thus, an early morning release is actually a very convenient, as well as lower cost, time to do the release.  As the site is mostly US customers in both a B2C and B2B use case, this timing (around 6:00 AM EDT) works very well, and I don't see it changing.<p>I realize this doesn't scale for a global app, but it explains the lack of pressure to spend much consideration on higher tech, more expensive, deployment methodologies.",1318867179

3121003,comment,3115577,3119489,2,0,tptacek,,,"I said ""tens of thousands of millisecond granular timers"", you can safely assume multiple timers on any given socket. You are describing something as complicated that has been a feature of every major event library since ACE_Wrappers.<p>I'm at a disadvantage arguing about working with evented timers in multithreaded environments, because generally I event to avoid threads. In environments where I've done both (for instance, Cocoa), I dedicate a thread to the event loop and give it a message queue interface to the other threads.<p>""Waking the polling thread"" is pretty straightforward. Just set up a pipe and ping it when you have a message you need delivered immediately. That's no more expensive than ""timerfd"".<p>I'm not arguing that select/poll are superior to epoll and kqueue (although select is just fine for many applications; why would I care, though; I don't write directly to select <i>or</i> kqueue). I'm saying that the Unix interface to timers isn't unscalable, and the scalability problems are in userland. Unlike select/poll, which did in fact have an O(n) problem <i>in the u/k interface</i>, the Unix interface to timers isn't a bottleneck.",1318867096

3120983,comment,3120017,3120017,1,0,IgorPartola,,,"Having built a custom cluster using vanilla MySQL + async replication, I can tell you that it's no walk in the park. Our requirement was to have the data shared across two data centers in different geographical areas with automated failover, and time from failure to failover completion of under 30 seconds. We managed to do this, but there were some very ugly parts. For one, we have no automated fail-back since promoting a slave, you lose the ability to deterministically figure out where other masters need to start replicating from (global TX IDs will solve this). We also get some false positives (much more than real failures) due to the fact that the cluster monitor has to be in yet a third geoarea. Lastly, this requires application support. We remedy this by having a common DB session layer and a messaging system for notifying all the applications of failures.<p>The good things about this are that we do get high availability with all the normal features of an RDMBS (JOINs, random queries, high-level query language, etc). We also have sharding baked-in so we get to distribute write queries across multiple masters. Having said that, the next time I need high availability I will be setting up either a two-node MySQL master-master cluster with mutual monitoring or some type of a different data store that provides eventual consistency.",1318866803

I liked the podcast in the beginning. It just simply took a different path than it should've in my opinion.<p>The title of it is ""Build & Analyze"" right? So, it should be about ""building"" things (whether that be coding, building said code, or as a metaphor for other things in life) and ""analyzing"" things related to the same... code or life.<p>But instead there is very little discussion of building... and the analyzing is ranty and uninspired.<p>One of the recommendations I made was Hypercritical with John Siracusa. Let's compare and contrast a bit..<p>Siracusa is one of those guys that just knows how to take something, whittle it down to nothing and find the faults. There's nothing wrong with finding fault in things. There will _always_ be faults, however big or small. The difference is in how Siracusa talks about them. He's critical of things to the point of beating a dead horse. Hypercritical is perfect for his podcast. Probably the most apt name I've ever seen for a podcast. But when he discusses these faults he provides some of the best examples he can come up with for _why_ he feels that way, and/or _how_ the faults they could be corrected.<p>Marco on the other hand just. Complains. I think he tried in the beginning to provide just cause for his complaining. But in the end he failed to be able to do it consistently. Instead, the podcast turned into another version of The Talk Show. At least with the Talk Show Gruber can be entertaining. Though I rarely listen unless the show notes show me something interesting. But Marco is trying to emulate Gruber and failing hard. Even his blog is taking on the same type of thing with a tiny bit more iOS discussion.<p>Either way. People can make their own opinion. I just hoped to make it a quick way for people to know to avoid it. If they're like me and they find annoying dick-ish podcast hosts to be on the do-not-listen list then they know right away that Build & Analyze isn't for them.",1318866771

First, you check your backups! Then, there are various strategies. You can make many simple schema changes while the system is running. Or put the DB in read-only mode and still mostly manage to serve pages -- perhaps with an occasional HTTP 503, so hopefully that's okay -- during your upgrade. Or phase in changes over several releases, carefully architecting for backward compatibility. Or bring up a parallel system and gradually migrate active users to it. Depending on what you're doing, you may find yourself having to write a special upgrade script that migrates old formats to new formats, or even using database triggers to keep ""old"" and ""new""-format tables in sync during the transition. A well-constrained database may help keep things sensible during the transition -- or, you may have to drop half of your supposedly-sensible constraints just to make the transition work.<p>Moral: Even if you know exactly what you're doing, live updates are more work: More planning, more code, more infrastructure, and/or more stress. In many real-world cases, you should just take the system down for a minute. Focus your engineering effort on making sure that ""minute"" is as short as possible, and in making sure that you can detect problems and roll back as quickly as possible.",1318866653

3120952,comment,3119644,3120711,1,0,rglullis,,,"Ok, I will try to break down the issue. Hope I make it clear.<p>- My keyboard layout is set to ""US, alternative international"".<p>- The thing with that layout, and most layouts intended for languages with accented letters, is that the quote keys are used to add accents to letters. To get the character """", I first type the character for single quote and follow it with a regular ""e"". Double quote followed by ""e"" gets you """". The same thing applies for tilde and the ""back accent"" (Crasis). With that you are able to type pretty much everything: .<p>- Because of this composability, the way to way get a quote (or tilde or crasis) is by typing the key you want and follow it with <spacebar>. If you just press the key for quote, the system will be waiting for the next key to figure out what you actually want.<p>- Here is the bug, I think:<p>1) the javascript on the ""enhanced text editor"" has a handler for the ""key-press, code 48"" event, that is fired whenever I press the ""quotation"" key.<p>2) the handler inserts/manipulates the textarea in any way, by moving the cursor or inserting text in the text area.<p>3) This manipulation of the text area resets the input buffer, and now there is no sign that I actually pressed the key.<p>4) when I try to complete my intended input (i.e, when I press <spacebar> to actually get the single-quote char), there is no sign of the previously pressed key, and all I get is a space.<p>I don't know if this is the exact mechanics of the bug. I just know that this is not the first time that I've tried to type single-quotes in a ""web-based text-editor"" and I get a space instead.",1318866511

Could you maybe provide some specifics and/or insight into what led you to that conclusion?  I appreciate your candor, but personal feelings aside, my site doesn't meet the criteria for being content farm based on Wikipedia's definition (or any other definition that I'm familiar with). And I'm not sure why you keep making the assumption that people aren't visiting my site directly as I never said that. At least half my traffic is from direct  / referral sources. I also have one of the more active user forums in my niche.<p>My site is cited by numerous museums, libraries, and reference sites as being an authoritative source for information related to my industry.  And after reading your comment I looked through Wikipedia for several hours and my site is one of the most commonly referenced and cited resources for my subject matter. For example: \n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_cards"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_cards</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topps</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Deck_Company"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Deck_Company</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie_cards"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie_cards</a><p>With all that said, since we cover niche news stories the length / depth of the content is dependent on the stories themselves. For instance, if a company releases an updated checklist for one of their sets, it may only give me enough information to create a 200 word article. But since its information that is both helpful and relevant to my readers, I publish it anyway. Maybe its time to cut that portion of my business out though and double down on other types of content so that I don't have news stories pulling the rest of my site's content down.",1318866016
3120904,comment,3120510,3120510,18,0,glen,,,"I knew something like this would eventually surface, but didn't realize it'd come from Pearson. We actually launched a very similar business model/site a year ago. I've been waiting to post anything on HN, b/c we are in the process of releasing a few changes (payments, channel updates) that I think would be helpful; but can save that for another time. We are really intrigued by this announcement b/c it is pretty much a direct competitor to what we are doing at NIXTY (www.nixty.com). I posted some thoughts on our blog and will highlight them here. I'd love to hear any thoughts/criticisms on this analysis.<p>There is ONE big difference between Pearson and NIXTY. Pearsons main focus is on Pearsons content. They are trying to make the LMS a commodity, so they can sell more of their content. NIXTY is focused on open education content.<p>Pearsons OpenClass = Selling more of Pearsons Closed Content/Courses<p>NIXTY = Supporting/Promoting Open Content/Courses<p>Pearson has the name open in the title, but the real goal is to sell more closed content. Will it work? We dont think so. Why?<p>1. Open Content is transforming education. It is free. Pearson will marginalize open content and focus on their own content. This will ultimately prove to be the undoing of OpenClass.<p>2. As the Inside Higher Ed article discussed, other publishing companies will not put their content in Pearsons OpenClass ecosystem. We are hoping that theyll look for a neutral alternative like NIXTY.<p>3.  Pearson hasnt exactly been awesome in the LMS space. eCollege is not what wed call a market leader. Im not sure, but it seems like eCollege folks might be in charge of the OpenClass product. Do they have the chutzpah to blow up eCollege to help OpenClass. Will the revenue streams from eCollege (tho likely decreasing) be sacrificed to help them grow OpenClass? Doubtful. Theyll likely try to keep both systems working and consequently end up doing a half-way job with OpenClass.<p>4. The comments around this from most folks in the articles and on Downes Google + post have been less than positive, suggesting that folks dont necessarily have a lot of trust in Pearson.<p>Now, to at least try to be fair, lets consider what Pearson has going for it.<p>1. Theyve got one BILLION dollars (said in my best Dr. Evil voice). Seriously, theyve got A LOT of money.<p>2. Theyve got a lot of strategic relationships with other organizations and institutions. They seem to have done a nice job of rolling this out with their 9 design schools. Nicely done!<p>3. Theyve got great content!<p>4. They are good at marketing! Youd think Google co-designed this thing from the get-go; really, however, OpenClass is just another app just like learnboost or any other number of education apps in the Google ecosystem.\nIn sum, Pearsons OpenClass is an innovative approach to help Pearson sell more of their closed content. We believe that theyll be forced to marginalize open content and competing closed content. Consequently, theyll end up doing students, educators, and colleges a disservice. NIXTY offers the same functionality, same price (free!), has been around for over a year, and doesnt have any content to hawk. Consequently, we can provide a better service to students, educators, and schools.",1318865992

Our setup basically consists of load balancers and application servers. When we need to upgrade, we require application version x always needs to be backwards compatible with application version x - 1, both on a protocol and data model level. Basically, our upgrade procedure is as follows:<p>1. distribute new package to all servers;<p>2. run an additional application service on all servers and run some quick tests on each of them to verify proper working;<p>3. add new application servers to load balancers;<p>4. upgrade data model to new version (we use postgresql, and this happends in a single db transaction, and remember that our new version x is compatbible with both the current and the previous data model);<p>5. remove old application services from load balancers;<p>6. upgrade successful.<p>If anything goes wrong, we can roll back each of these steps. Note that this whole process, perhaps needless to say, is fully automated.<p>By running multiple versions inside the load balancer at the same time, and having the requirement that version x + 1 is always compatible with version x, this procedure allows us to seamlessly upgrade to a new version without any downtime.",1318865845

3120861,comment,3118620,3119150,2,0,eastwest,,,"I actually agree with you. I much prefer operator overloading than unwieldy chained function calls. But it might be tough to convince the larger Python community to add it since it is only useful to a small part of the community.<p>The last comment about dtypes is that the size (shape in NumPy) should be part of the type; certainly element-type should be. A 1-D vector of double should not be the same Python type as 3-D array of characters or a 500x600 matrix. This creates havoc in a dynamic language. I once spent two days tracking down a bug caused by ""*"" multiplying two arrays instead of two matrices when I started using NumPy. Perhaps size is too much for a dynamic language to be part of type, but surely dimension and element-type should be reflected in Python type. It absolutely does not help that the documentation is littered with type-objects and object-objects; I appreciate this is how C implementations are, but for a beginner NumPy users, it is more than a little confusing.<p>I have a lot of respect for people who designed and built NumPy; for multi-dimensional arrays I don't see a better approach; but too much of influence of C implementation details seep into Python interface, types and operator overloading are only the beginning of the problems. I am having second thought about the suitability of dynamic languages for large scale, high-performance computing. Type annotation could help a lot but I see there is exactly zero interest in that for NumPy.",1318865456

As for companies failing, the last several years have shown us that educated people will happily destroy companies for personal gain (not that we didn't already know this).<p>Natural disasters can be made less probable by choosing an appropriate location, not avoided entirely. An asteroid can hit Arizona as easily as New York. And earthquakes can basically strike anywhere. They're simply more likely in certain areas.<p>My argument for cryonics' low probability is based on the fact that so many things can go wrong over such a long time frame (we don't engineer nuclear facilities to last for thousands of years). The fact that some people have pursued cryonics is in no way proof or even evidence of it's feasibility. How many billions of people pursue religion for the same reasons?

This doesn't <i>necessarily</i> accurately reflect the reality. It's an obvious starting point, and as the data capture technologies involved become more advanced it's clearly the way to guide future experiments, ideas and development, but it also leads to a situation where a lot of the critical factors in various complex processes aren't being looked at in the right way.<p>That's not to say, of course, that this is a problem unique to biology - quantum mechanics represents a pretty good model of fundamental particle physics, but its likely it doesn't <i>actually</i> reflect what's going on. That's not to say that the advances brought by QM haven't been huge, and ultimately there comes a point where if a model is indistinguishable from the reality using all our methods then can you really say the two are different?

Furthermore, I think many of us  know Americans who immigrated in their teens and have been here for a long time and really are indistinguishable from native speakers.<p>I also am highly skeptical of your claim you are more native in programming, but I started when I was in my early teens so I'm not sure I can comment.<p>I think your skill at learning languages rises when you are very young, and you face diminishing returns after that, so adults never get that much better at learning a language than when they were young. With other things you begin later in life, you start at the bottom of the learning curve and improve much more. So adults and kids are usually about as good at language learning, unlike most things, so people think kids are magically gifted at learning languages because they are about as good as adults. And of course, adults are actually much better because they already know all the real world concepts from their L1.

3120770,comment,3120539,3120539,1,0,afdssfda,,,"I think saying that Agile development is broken because it is too developer-centric is BS. It is all about implementation.<p>XP for example is meant to be customer-centric. The point of it is to complete working functionality for the customer, and the customer should drive the development and what features are needed.<p>Scrum is similar in that the customer can define a bunch of requirements and prioritize them and the team works on those priorities.<p>The problem with any development being about development and not about the customer's needs has to do with management. I've seen and heard of many mismanaged Agile teams, but none where the problem was Agile. Agile might have been the excuse for lack of organization and direction, but good management that focuses on the customer needs as well as the developers' needs is what is needed- that can be done with Agile (e.g. XP, Scrum), Kanban, and other methods focused on quick incremental delivery usually much more easily than other methodologies (e.g. Waterfall).<p>With regard to:<p>""As Igal pointed out in this summers webinar, what is a unit that is tested in a unit test? Business logic.""<p>Strictly speaking, yes, but generally if you describe what a unit test is doing to a user, assuming it is really a unit test, most of the time they would not agree that it is business logic. Business logic is usually considered a lot more high-level. Human-language-based customer readable test definitions can potentially be created in Cucumber and similar BDD frameworks. There are also products that use UI-based behavior driven test definitions. But, in my experience, even these haven't really defined solely the business logic; there is always some level of implementation detail that creeps in. But, you do what you can. From what I've seen and heard, sometimes having the developer or analyst work with the customer to define tests is a good idea, and other times it is a wash or is a time sink. Do whatever it takes is basically the rule of thumb- i.e. there are no hard and fast rules to these things.<p>Good luck to the guy that ditches Agile because it is ""broken"".",1318864332

There are so many complete breakdowns of basic logic here that it makes my head spin.<p>>>> Prejudice against older programmers is wrong, but new research suggests it's also inaccurate.<p>Setting aside the issue at hand for a second, I want to point out that holding some true belief is neither morally right nor morally wrong, it is just the state of being correct.  I think most of us would agree being correct is always preferable to being incorrect. Yet here the author claims that believing something can be morally wrong even if it is a true belief? That's a little weird.<p>>>> A dandy natural experiment to test the technical chops of the old against the young has been conductedor discoveredby two computer scientists at North Carolina State University, in Raleigh. Professor Emerson Murphy-Hill and Ph.D. student Patrick Morrison went to Stack Overflow, a Web site where programmers answer questions and get rated by the audience. It turned out that ratings rose with contributors' age...<p>No.  Just no.<p>I see no reason to accept the assumption that how high your score is on stack overflow relates in any meaningful way to how effective you are at computer programming. For example, if I took two programmers who were equal in every way, except that one spends the entire workday on stack overflow and the other works very hard all day, the one that has the lower stack overflow score is far more effective.<p>I see no reason to accept the assumption that stack overflow is in any way representative of the programming community in any way.  It is a self selected group of people that may or may not be employed as programmers.<p>This isn't a study, it's a joke.<p>The fact is, the quality of any individual programmer increases with age and experience.  However, the average quality of all programmers of a given age decreases above some age.  How are these two facts both true? People get promoted out of being programmers all the time, but very few people become programmers past a certain age.  People become managers, consultants, executives, entrepreneurs.",1367812288

5660761,comment,5659666,5659666,1,0,callmeed,,,"First of all, having used sitter city, I don't really like their model. Once you find a sitter or 2 you like, there's no reason to keep paying for the site.<p>Differentiating between a ""network"" and a ""marketplace"" can be tough (I'd call sitter city a marketplace because its buyers & sellers pretty much). That being said, here's some things that popped into my head recently:<p>- collect class schedules from all the different gyms (spin, Zumba, step, yoga, crossfit, etc) and let people browse them. Try to negotiate deals with some to sell drop-in passes OR charge a monthly fee for X passes and share some of the $ with the gym they choose to go to.<p>- Better than sitter city's model, I think, is to have an Uber-like model where you just text a number (Twilio!) and they'll line up for a qualified person for the time you need.<p>- Dating service where you pay monthly and that $ goes towards a weekly blind date lunch with someone they've matched you with. (Married 8 years so sorry if this exists or is utterly stupid)<p>- A decent upcoming.org replacement still doesn't exist (save some niche alternatives). Create a network to somehow crowdsource a local events guide.<p>- Youth sports and summer rec. activities. Our kids do a lot of stuff and its hard to keep track of what's going on every day. Also, finding things for them to do during the summer is a pain here (we have multiple cities, each with their own programs-all in friggin PDF form).<p>- text restaurants/bars at 2-3pm (Twilio!) and ask what their happy hour, dinner and drink specials will be for the night. Broadcast that to a web page/email list/app. Boom, eventually you could have something like Groupon but that restaurants can get behind better.",1367810802

I am not convinced that giving people the option of controlling their own data would convince them to switch? I think suggesting something like that is pretty ignorant of facebook's appeal and growth. If the argument is ""people will switch because they will realize facebook is bad for them"" then facebook becomes an industry behind a long line of other industries taking advantage of people, and on the grand scale of things, is probably one of the most harmless.<p>Next, it seems to me for this approach critical mass, you may end up with a centralized diaspora pod, in which that user is hypothetically free to sell your data, which doesn't really fix the problem.<p>At the end of the day if I need a tight, controlled, social network of only people I trust without the fear of my data being sold, I will use the social networks I've already been using, namely, email, phone, and in-person communication.<p>IMO, Diaspora is pretty low on the list of what will bankrupt Zuckerberg. If Google can spend 100s of millions of dollars on a social network and not steal significant traction, diaspora needs a better killer feature than ""you own your data.""

Font style and size are therefore important.<p>This is why (I suspect) something like bootstrap is so important, it gives you the right start on a layout which is simple and appealing.<p>You then customise that layout with your colors, and images are a collection of colors, so I suspect your website colors along with any images are absorbed by the user at mostly the same time.<p>Your logo is also an image, and compared to text, is often prominent. Therefore, logo should probably be considered slightly after images and colours.<p>You can also think of your question from a 'reptile brain' angle. At each step, a users mind is asking if what they are looking at is a threat or is appealing.<p>This brain has to view the entire page at once, therefore, layout. \nIt then will pick out the next features it can, colours and images. \nThen it will drill in on text.

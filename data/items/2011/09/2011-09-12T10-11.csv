While a hypothetical antimatter galaxy puts out the same light as a matter one and probably looks exactly like normal matter from the outside, there is a telltale signature: it would put out additional gamma rays. Space is not empty, even intergalactic space is filled with atomic particles (albeit in a weak concentration). This means that an antimatter region somewhere out there would react at the boundary with an adjacent matter region and this reaction would put out radiation that we can measure. In some instances, there would even be very violent gamma flashes from colliding galaxies.<p>While such a boundary may still exist outside of our observable range, the size of that area makes it pretty unlikely because everything we can see so far is pretty much uniform. We can see about 13.8 billion light years in either direction (note that this is a view not only through space but also back through time to the beginning of the universe), and we haven't come across such a phenomenon within that area.<p>In short: it's possible but this stuff would have to be extremely far out and if it's happening at all it may well be beyond our cosmic horizon.",1315824307

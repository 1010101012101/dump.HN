2648815,comment,2648681,2648681,14,0,veosotano,,,"Hi there! My name is Miro Keller, and I'm the founder of AXR, so I'll probably be the best person to answer any questions you guys may have. So feel free to ask me anything about this project :)<p>I'll try to answer all questions posed here, step by step:<p>@shimonamit:
The code is not the only part that's important here, it's just one piece of the puzzle. So how would you go about to determine what part of the code to show, and at the same time try to convey the general idea to the visitors, without overwhelming them with too much information at once?<p>If you click on the ""enter the site"" button you'll see the spec, where there's plenty of code for you to read through :)<p>@ahrens:
One of the most important points about the project it's that it would be the <i>same</i> library used by the browsers, they wouldn't reimplement it. And to account for syntax variations in future versions, there is a versioning system, where the author of the document declares which one it is targeting. Thus, the rendering engine will know what the author actually wanted to say and interpret it accordingly.<p>What other ways of sharing data do you mean? We are open to suggestions about what technologies to use, we just want it to be great. Keep in mind that there are a couple of requirements, all of which are achieved with XML, such as:<p>- It needs a way to be semantic, so that common things on the internet must be representable, such as products, events, flight reservations, etc. XML solves this with namespaces.
- It needs to be able to provide a way to show documents written in that language in current browsers using a plug-in. XML solves that with XSLT (there will be a standard .xls file for easy backwards compatibility).
- It should be able to be just uploaded on an FTP server by the average author, just as HTML, without installing server-side software or messing around with settings.
- It should be easy to write for authors.<p>So, again, we are open for suggestions, but keep in mind those requirements. If any other one you know of fits the bill, we would love to hear about it!<p>@drKarl
You're missing the point. XML is used to represent the <i>structure of your data</i>, not the presentation. That's what HSS is for.<p>On the other hand, with all those other languages you mentioned you have the problem that you'll always end with plain old CSS. Therefore you may get an easier syntax, but you still have all the problems associated with CSS: browser fragmentation, static syntax (you can't do ""100%-50px"" or ""ref(height of myOtherElement)"" ), no vector shapes support in the language itself (SVG doesn't count), etc.<p>@lovskogen
Well AXR tries to be an alternative platform to HTML+CSS, not to replace it. It would still face much competition from that and Flash, Silverlight, or any other RIA out there....<p>The proposed solution is that the implementation is provided by the project itself, so that the rendering engine would be always the same. They could still differentiate themselves by providing unique UI, history management, social media integration, developer tools, etc. The part that we want to be the same, and only that part, would be the same. Of course, there is more to it than this, such as auto updating the engine independently from the browser, versioning system for stylesheets, etc, but that would be too in depth to discuss it here :)<p>@kevingadd
Basically the main reason we opted for C++ was performance and cross-platform compatibility. Doing it in JavaScript would make it slow as hell. But hey, we would love to see more ideas of how this could be done. At the end of the day this is just a prototype, it is meant to explore ideas and see if and how this can be done at all.<p>You're wrong about nobody able to use it, since one of the main goals of this project is to support older browsers to increase chances of adoption. That's why there is a step-gap measure in the plan to create a wrapper that will use the library as a browser plug-in, so that it can be installed anywhere where there is a NPAPI or ActiveX interface (in IE). We already spotted a framework that will assist us in this (<a href=""http://www.firebreath.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.firebreath.org</a>), so hopefully this won't be too difficult :)<p>Cheers,

This annoys me, for various practical reasons: I became (maybe a bad thing?) dependent on decent, free and _readable_ maps. Maps are easy to get by, but I am used to get a decent preview of places I'm interested in. I'd love to explore the country virtually and check out places of interest, possible targets for a day off or a weekend trip.<p>Pretty certainly someone, somewhere thought that this would be necessary and a good idea, but I fail to grasp the reasons. It seems as if the 'privacy' gained by censoring/prohibiting this kind of imagery is borderline security by obscurity.

It was in one of the popular scientific magazines at the time.  The theory was that you could construct a lattice and have lasers on each axis that could change state of arbitrary molecules in the lattice. (If I remember correctly it was a three state change molecule, or at least there were three wavelengths that did different things to the molecule depending on its state.)<p>Obviously that doesn't work so well, because using a laser to target only a single molecule in a lattice is hard, and because of statistical thermodynamics some bits are going to get corrupted so you'd need error correction and periodic rescans of the entire data array to fix corrupted bits.  Nevertheless, they were speculating it would see commercialization in 4-8 years.  Well, here we are approaching 2 decades later.  I see no organic molecule storage on the market.<p>Finding a molecule that can change state is nothing new.

I have never gotten even one penny in research grants from anything having to do with climate in any sense.  So, the claim of the Web site at your URL that Exxon is funding 'skeptics' is irrelevant to me.<p>There's nothing significant against Exxon at that Web site, certainly nothing like your ""organized disinformation campaign"".<p>Maybe Exxon funded some 'climate science', although the Web site gave no evidence.<p>Well, how'd the whole 'global warming' thing get started anyway?  Sure:  VP Al Guru told the NSF, etc. to fund his buddies for 'climate alarmism'.  That's how the 'closed community' of 'climate science' alarmists got started:  They all reviewed each other's research papers and grant proposals, and they all knew that there was only one source of money, Al Guru, and that that source wanted only one answer -- human CO2 raising temperatures.  Now that they are on the back of that tiger, and could not have a career in science anywhere else, they have to just keep riding that tiger.<p>But your URL has alarmist nonsense about extreme weather -- droughts heat waves, etc.  There's essentially no connection between such things and the arguments about global warming, at least not for decades or centuries.<p>So, the increases in temperature over the past few decades are so small that they are tough to measure or to show an increase, but even without showing an increase in temperature we are supposed to believe that the increase, too small to measure, is causing massive climate 'change' now, as with the tornadoes this spring?  Total reeking BS.<p>But when the predictions for global warming clearly didn't happen, there was a memo to talk about climate 'change'.  While global 'warming' can be characterized by just average temperature, say, over the planet, over a year, measured by, say, satellite, and while some temperature records go back hundreds of years and some temperature evidence, say, ice core data, goes back hundreds of thousands of years, climate 'change' is MUCH more difficult to evaluate, e.g., compare with the past.  While the past temperature record is nothing like what we can measure today, the climate 'change' record is much worse.  So, the climate change screamers can keep screaming, as for the tornadoes this spring, without much comparison with the past.<p>For the funding corrupting science, f'get about Exxon and concentrate on Al Guru.<p>That is, the LESS data they have, the MORE screaming they are free to do.  We just should refuse to listen.<p>Besides, the usual media, ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, CNN, PBS, just LOVE the morality play of evil humans doing transgressions and causing retribution and the drama of tornadoes.  Grab'm by the gut, and their eyeballs will be sure to follow, and then get the ad revenue.  Those media outlets are in the ad business and will push anything at all, any sewage -- crime, scandal, blood, danger -- that can be turned into drama to grab people by the heart, the gut, and below the belt.<p>E.g., what was the frequency of tornadoes in the area of the present state of Kansas each year over the past 400 years?  Not a chance of getting good data.  And, heck, the media won't even report such frequency data over the past, say, decade.  Why not?  The data would show no significant change, have no drama, and would kill the made up story with drama.<p>So, the tornadoes this spring can be screamed to be from 'climate change' from evil humans, as we have heard.<p>You are spouting just alarmist nonsense.<p>The data for human caused significant global warming is BS; for climate change, much worse.  You have no serious evidence.<p>You didn't take my advice just to relax and f'get about Al Guru.<p>How much are YOU getting paid?",1307966522

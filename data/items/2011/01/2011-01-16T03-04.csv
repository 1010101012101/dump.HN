2108616,comment,2108101,2108101,0,0,jdietrich,,,"The fundamental issue is yield. The more pixels in a display, the greater the likelihood that you'll end up with an obtrusive stuck pixel or a significant number of dead pixels, rendering the panel unsaleable. This is one of the major reasons why we haven't seen any significant increases in the resolution of laptop or desktop displays in some years. The Retina display on the iPhone 4 isn't hugely expensive, nor particularly innovative - there are a number of other handsets with similar pixel densities. 960x340 is 0.6 million pixels, versus three million pixels in this rumoured iPad 2.<p>Very high resolution displays ameliorate this issue somewhat because bad pixels are less noticeable, but I just don't see how anyone could produce a display with such a vast pixel count cheaply enough to meet the iPad's price point.<p>If Apple have figured it out, the iPad 2 is almost irrelevant. This would be one of the most significant breakthroughs in display technology in decades. Bear in mind that 2560x1600 is the same resolution as the current class-leader in desktop displays, the $900 30-inch Dell Ultrasharp. In order to make it work, Apple would have to change the entire economics of LCD manufacture. I really do hope it's true, but I can't see how.",1295150394

Why does it fall slightly short?  If this is purely comparative then why isn't doesn't the most dangerous drug align with the highest number?  And why 3?  A scale of 1 to 10 seems like a more common choice for arbitrary scales.  And where would something obviously more harmful (like say, draincleaner) fall on that graph?

Now what if we could solve one of the games easily but the other game was hard, if the graphs are identical you could covert any game state between the two games, thus using the easy game to solve the hard game.<p>So then you can look at things at how to create an easy game which has the same graph as a hard game, obviously for something like chess this is hard, but you don't have to replicate the whole game graph, you can do it in chunks breaking the big graph into a series of smaller graphs and then attacking them.<p>There's all sort of other interesting things you can do with game graphs, for example you can start enumerating all games with a certain complexity (in terms of node and vertices) and ask questions like ""are some game graphs fundamentally more difficult than others"" and perhaps more importantly ""why?"". I think the area has a big potential for deepening our understanding of board games and also raising some interesting complexity and information theory problems.",1295148155

Second, Credit Unions exist.<p>BankSimple seems to be a no-branch bank like ING-Direct.  They're presenting themselves as being better.  How are they different?  Well, they're pushing the idea of no-fees, better customer service, and better mobile banking.  In order to achieve that, they'll have to be more efficient or accept a lower profit margin.  Banks have healthy margins so there is some room there, but there are other industries with higher margins.<p>The second piece is that there are already not-for-profit banks.  They're called Credit Unions.  They exist to give their customers (who are their owners) the best deal they can.  In order to be better than credit unions, they'll have to be significantly more efficient rather than simply relying on lower margins.<p>Part of what makes me skeptical is that they aren't creating a bank.  They're partnering with currently chartered banks.  This is probably because it's very difficult to create a bank and there's a lot of regulation to deal with.  However, this somewhat limits what they can do to give me a better deal than a bank (since they're just reselling the product of another bank).  Now, banks vary in how good of a deal they give you so part of their product might simply be getting you a good account under their brand.  But part of this means that BankSimple won't be doing what banks normally do with deposits.  Banks normally lend it out or invest it.  BankSimple will be parking it in another account.  So, if they aren't charging fees, how will they make their money?  Maybe they've found an account that will give them 1% interest and they'll pass on 0.5% interest to me.  However, why shouldn't I just bypass them?  If they're doing things like refunding ATM fees, covering overdraft fees, etc. will the interest difference cover that?<p>I'm not saying that it can't be done.  They stress no-fees and earning more interest.  If they aren't lending the money out themselves, that will be hard to do - especially considering that they're claiming the best customer service, best software, etc.  Where are they making their money?  Not off fees and they aren't lending it out, but rather relying on other banks.<p>I'd really love to see their business plan since I assume they've addressed these things.  Maybe wholesale banking exists and offers them a lot more.  Maybe credit unions are woefully inefficient.  I'm excited for their launch, but I'm not unhappy with my credit union.",1295148064

6100830,comment,6099765,6100216,1,0,pyoung,,,"I can see a few potential flaws that could have caused them to not get follow up funding (although I am in no way suggesting that they didn&#x27;t get follow up funding)<p>1.  Cost.  People in Africa are poor, so unless these can be produced and sold for pennies a piece, it probably won&#x27;t take off.  Using the &#x27;buy one, donate one&#x27; method probably doesn&#x27;t scale enough to solve the malaria problem.
2.  Behavior.  Condoms are a fairly effective method to practice safe sex, and despite a massive amount of money and education, adoption has been slow, or non-existent in Africa.  I can see similar issues with Kite.
3. Effectiveness - While they may work, they may not have been shown to be effective enough to warrant further funding.
4. For-profit?  I can&#x27;t seem to find anything on the companies website, but the gates foundation prefers to give their money to non-profits. If they are a for-profit company, I could see reluctance on the foundations part to continue providing funds.<p>On a personal note, this seems like a cool product that I would use when camping/hiking.  But for some of the reasons mentioned above, I would be skeptical to declare this as the solution to malaria in third-world countries, not that I would mind to be proven wrong.  I wish them the best of luck.",1374724673

If MS was bright had any respect for their speakers they would have dynamically made room available for this speaker&#x27;s wife in some area inside the conference center.   They are idiots for not bending rules doing it.   But to also think they shoved her out a door and steel barred the entrance and left her there by herself in the middle of Voodoo Shantytown New Orleans where the creole shamans and werewolves circled her is just as crazy.<p>I get where the author is coming from and totally understand his stance, but I honestly do not believe that MS intentionally put his (non-invited?) wife in harms way.  From his description MS treated him awfully and I hope they realize this and attempt to correct it in the future and see where being human in some instances is indirectly worth more than the price of admission to TechEd, but lets be honest - they didn&#x27;t make his wife walk the plank to circling sharks.",1374724618

I have the standard editting keys in my fingers for loading files (C-x C-f C-a C-k pathprefix TAB path TAB etc..).  That stuff breaks with ido and I get stalled and have to compose myself and figure out what I'm doing.<p>Wouldn't it have been possible to preserve both the classic editability of the path string <i>and</i> have fuzzy matching?",1221411431

303860,comment,303820,303820,0,0,ajross,,,"Honestly, I think even this article is a little to rosy on Sun's prospects.  On the software side, they've basically ceded the high performance server world to linux.  Tools like dtrace and zfs, while nice, aren't really dealmakers to normal people, and let's be honest: those are really Solaris's <i>only</i> competitive advantages against RHEL or Ubuntu.<p>And in hardware, they've bet the farm on Niagra which, contra the hopeful quotes in the article, really isn't all that great a CPU.  It's two process nodes behind Intel (and one and a half behind AMD), and it's a largely unchanged core from the late 90's that doesn't scale beyond 1 GHz or so.  The power efficiency point is valid, but only for some workloads (highly parallel servers, basically), and only by a tiny bit.  Newer quad-core Xeon's are nipping at Sun's heels as we speak, and have vastly better per-core performance.",1221410775

303857,comment,303720,303813,0,0,robg,,,"I appreciate your perspective. I am a neuroscientist, and this subject closely rubs up against my training. I see nothing in handwriting that typing doesn't also give the developing brain. If anything, typing, especially touch, seems to require <i>more</i> fine motor skills than handwriting. And with the possibility of computer games to help teach typing, and coincident with auditory (hear 's' versus 'sh' versus 'sp') feedback (which helps normal and atypical reading development), you could teach typing, reading, writing, and spelling in one well-designed program while providing different types of focused feedback. Handwriting not only has less real world utility, but it is also harder to learn while being a more solitary skill. The more I think about it the more I'm verging on outrage that so much emphasis is still given to handwriting over typing.",1221410317

Instead, one would conclude that the product was a no-go and adjust their strategy to fit (in this case, putting the idea on the shelf).<p>Consider marketing the social component of design.  In the whole ""Make Something People Want"" bit, marketing identifies the ""something people want"" part.  ""Make"" is important, but it doesn't mean jack if you're making the wrong thing.<p>It sounds as though this guy might have had a good market for condom cases ( <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=condom+cases"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=condom+cases</a> ), particularly in the 80s when the things were just coming out from behind the pharmacist's counter, but he didn't pursue that initially and his second attempt appears to have been an approximation of what people actually wanted to buy.<p>If he instead identified what people wanted (reliable condom cases) and delivered that instead of a novelty which sold well to Bangkok tourists, he may have had a business.",1221410272

Writing (already mentioned): Seriously, hard stuff and obsoleted by keyboards.<p>2. Reading: reading is hard, you need to know hundreds of thousands if not millions of words and <i>exactly</i> what they look like. Obsoleted by screen readers.<p>3. Arithmetic: Boring, terminally boring, requires memorization of multiple tables or an understanding of the very basic concepts behind it and makes people hate maths. Obsoleted by computers.<p>4. Algebra: Not terribly difficult (unless you are a math major) and nobody really uses it. Besides, we have mathematica.<p>5. Calculus: See point 4.<p>6. Mathematics: See point 5.<p>7. History: Long, hard, requires memorizing information on so many dead people. What is the point. Obsoleted by books (or audiotapes as the need arises).<p>8. Science: Seriously, have you seen physics.

Something you think kinda sucks and is just a 'filler' product in your line up turns out to be the most popular, and you run out of stock.

303845,comment,303592,303717,0,0,DaniFong,,,"There's an example that's fairly easy to measure. tallness.<p>Here's what Malcom Gladwell had to say:<p><i>I polled about half of the companies on the Fortune 500 list--the largest corporations in the United States--asking each company questions about its CEO. The heads of big companies are, as I'm sure comes as no surprise to anyone, overwhelmingly white men, which undoubtedly reflects some kind of implicit bias. But they are also virtually all tall: In my sample, I found that on average CEOs were just a shade under six feet. Given that the average American male is 5'9"" that means that CEOs, as a group, have about three inches on the rest of their sex. But this statistic actually understates matters. In the U.S. population, about 14.5 percent of all men are six feet or over. Among CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, that number is 58 percent. Even more strikingly, in the general American population, 3.9 percent of adult men are 6'2"" or taller. Among my CEO sample, 30 percent were 6'2"" or taller.</i><p>Whatever the reasoning, Americans seem to want to be lead by taller people.<p>Maybe there is some actual correlation between competence and looks. That wouldn't be terribly startling (though maybe it's due large to the fact that competent looking people are given more opportunities).<p>But what <i>would</i> be startling is for it to have such an overwhelming effect. That, I'm almost sure, is a fluke.",1221409165
303844,comment,303720,303745,0,0,newt0311,,,"Hmm... I take all my notes in LaTeX as well. For me, I found that it was more a matter of having the correct macros than any inherent slowness in the LaTeX type setting system. My preamble grew to about 130 lines before I was really able to type effectively in class. However, the benefits of this approach are undeniable. It halped me become good at LaTeX but more than that it made my notes easy to archive, retrieve, share, and use in general. Referring back to old theorems is a lot faster when you have Ctrl-F at your disposal.<p>The key is that if you write a similar thing more that ~3 times, make an emacs abbrev for it or a latex macro for it.",1221409122

Marketing is ALWAYS wrong till it works, research is only right after it is proven true.

It's a learning experience at every level!<p>My own take is that the poor guy's fundamental error was that he jumped the gun on outsourcing. He should have built the first hundred prototypes by hand on his kitchen table, with parts scrounged from one hobby store or another, then sold them himself. It sounds like he basically ended up doing that <i>anyway</i>, but if he'd done so in the first place he'd have invested less up front, gotten feedback faster, and gotten an intuitive sense of his market and the sort of product they'd prefer.

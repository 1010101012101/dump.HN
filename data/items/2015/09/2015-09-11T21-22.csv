GraphQL is a query language designed to build client applications by providing an intuitive and flexible syntax and system for describing their data requirements and interactions.<p>GraphQL is not a programming language capable of arbitrary computation, but is instead a language used to query application servers that have capabilities defined in this specification. GraphQL does not mandate a particular programming language or storage system for application servers that implement it. Instead, application servers take their capabilities and map them to a uniform language, type system, and philosophy that GraphQL encodes. This provides a unified interface friendly to product development and a powerful platform for tool‐building.&quot;<p>This is very different goal that most graph query languages.",1442008764

But B was not powerful enough for systems programming, so Dennis Ritchie added data types and structures to it. The resulting C language evolved from B beginning in 1971; in 1973 Thompson and Ritchie finally succeeded in rewriting Unix in their new language. This was quite an audacious move; at the time, system programming was done in assembler in order to extract maximum performance from the hardware, and the very concept of a portable operating system was barely a gleam in anyone&#x27;s eye. As late as 1979, Ritchie could write: “It seems certain that much of the success of Unix follows from the readability, modifiability, and portability of its software that in turn follows from its expression in high-level languages”, in the knowledge that this was a point that still needed making.",1442008199

Perhaps they didn&#x27;t do as well in 2003 when the article was written but they do now.<p>Second, you don&#x27;t <i>really</i> have to search for all 3 cast tokens individually (most people would probably look for &quot;_cast&quot; and expect it to catch everything).  If you want to be explicit though, &quot;egrep &#x27;(dynamic|static|reinterpret)_cast&#x27;&quot; isn&#x27;t that hard, especially if you make it a script.<p>I do agree that the definitions of static_cast<> and reinterpret_cast<> are a bit unclear and to this day I probably screw them up in a few places.  The naming of const_cast<> is also weird since it removes both &quot;const&quot; and &quot;volatile&quot;, and it&#x27;s even murkier now that C++11 has things like std::remove_const (presumably the latter is to help template implementations but are these not also forms of casting?).<p>Perhaps the operators should have been static methods in a standard class such as &quot;std::cast::...&quot; so that all present and future cast-like conversions could be found by searching for that prefix.",1442007899

I am not totally opposed to patents, and I think your examples undermine your argument since they describe innovations that are clearly patentable (whereas my mention of Uber applying for a patent on surge pricing is highly questionable under the Prior Art standard).<p>My main problem is the use of capital to establish market dominance by indirectly buying out the public commons. Taxpayers arguably subsidized the development of Cornell&#x27;s robotics department, with the benefits of their research being available across the whole economy (possibly through patent licensing), but by hiring away all the staff at once Uber has indirectly appropriated a chunk of that public subsidy.<p>Now all the individual scientists who worked there are independent agents who presumably liked the terms of the offers they received and also wanted to continue working with each other. One could say that the human capital in the lab was undervalued by the public funding option, but one could equally argue that Uber has helped itself to a large consumer surplus (<i>qua</i> hoarding the supply of available robotics scientists) with the joint effect of denying their availability to competitors, and increasing the price the public will have to pay to re-establish a comepetitive department, if it can do so at all.<p>There is no guarantee that this will result in an increase in robotics innovation from the private sector. It might suit Uber equally well to pay the robotics scientists to sit around and do nothing or otherwise fritter away the investment, as long as the scientists&#x27; absence from the marketplace of ideas disadvantages Uber&#x27;s competitors. In other words, you don&#x27;t need your own robot car, you just need to make it harder for anyone else to build robot cars that could compete with you.<p>I do <i>not</i> want to suggest that Uber has evil motives here, by the way - I have no idea what the firm&#x27;s plans or goals are.

The right is mired in a religious spiral and the left has yet to discover a seam of genuine connection across class to unite over.  However it is clear that economics is changing and that class divisions will likely align along wealth.<p>Pikkety is French economist who claims he proves that returns to capital are increasing faster than incomes.  The means the rich will get richer faster. The last time this happened was Edwardian era (staving children in London, banquets on the Titanic, massive unrest).  The wars of 20 C removed wealth from rich and reallocated it more fairly as democracy and technology spread.<p>However it&#x27;s going back.  Varoufakis is left wing Greek economist (used to work for Valve) and became Greek finance minister when Greece elected a left wing government in January.<p>Greece has been the European gateway to Middle East and Russia - it spends ten times average on military and when it joined the Euro (effectively a gold standard) it joined at wrong exchange rate - really badly wrong.<p>Their economy was shot - Germany for example is able to import Greek olives and export more Greek olive oil than Greece does (Greeks have not invested in automation, their farm subsidies are against it, German farm subsidies fuck up a different part of German agriculture)<p>Anyway Greece economy collapses - but they are in the Euro, so they can&#x27;t make Greek Drachmas cheaper to help exports - so the only option is to pay people less (it&#x27;s called internal devaluation or something) it is clearly a shit system for balancing out productivity across Europe<p>What should happen is a federal agreement to reallocate funds through tax and spend and bonds.  But federalism is political death in Europe.<p>So a well meaning elite has for decades been pushing a European project - stop war happening again by building trade links, then improve trade by harmonising standards, then improve finance by using same currency, then we will join as a political union and never kill 100 million people again.<p>Unfortunately the Euro is a gold standard and will kill you at the wrong exchange rate - and you can either have federal reallocation of funds (sensible but politically impossible) or you can force the people to take pay cuts till their productivity matches their income.<p>Varoufakis has been pointing this out for years, then got elected and stood up to the European project and said this is economic madness, the people have given us a mandate, you can&#x27;t manage the structural change like this.  He probably called the German finance minister a Nazi during heated discussions.<p>This all went down like a lead balloon - either Greece toed the line and dumped it&#x27;s democratic mandated and got fucked over, or European project (peace not war) had to end.  The Germans held the debt over Greeks till Greeks blinked first.<p>So we have a Western economic consensus of austerity and &quot;fudging&quot; the worlds second largest currency, a renminbi that is based on spreadsheets massaged by politicians desperate to look good while Chine goes from industrial to manufacturing, and a willingness to overlook 1930s level suffering to keep from facing deep political divisions over federalism.<p>At the same time Russia is trying to foment a war or two in order to grab something just East of Greece.<p>Sorry I seem to have lost the thread and scrolling upwards on iPhone textbox is hard.<p>So two left wing economists represent the zeitgeist - we are seeing greater returns to private capital (do you wonder why all those unicorns funded by A16Z have not IPOd? Because they can get as much cash as they want from sovereign funds and banks.)   Greater returns to private capital, no left wing intellectual consensus on what is happening and democratic outpourings asking for debt relief are forced out of the way.<p>Now with a new set of massive tech companies, who are making bets on far reaching changes, not because they are white elephants but because the industries that will wipe out today&#x27;s global stars are already visible on radar, those industries are going to reward tech skills highly (and increase returns to capital) for say 20% of us, and then will break the social convention of sharing in increased wealth through regular jobs because robots will be doing the jobs.<p>So it&#x27;s a perfect storm of technology taking away jobs, no political will to get behind legitimate democratic discontent and meet difficult decisions about the structure of society, returns on capital making class divisions wider, and new forms of global companies being created without Public company style scrutiny, and without a global consensus on how to effectively tax such structures.<p>We can use technology to usher in a golden age - the economics of technology almost mandate another century of massive wealth creation planet wide.  But sharing that fairly and in a managed way is the challenge - and that challenge is represented by those two economists.<p>Sorry - wall of text, unedited.

10206261,comment,10204255,10205184,0,0,pluma,,,"The other day I watched Superman Returns and Man of Steel back to back. Spoilers follow, but I think I have a point.<p>The symbolism in Superman Returns was pretty obvious. In addition to the patriotism carried by the colours of his costume, he&#x27;s obviously a kind of modern-day Superjesus: he&#x27;s a superhuman only son sent to Earth to protect (save) all of mankind. There&#x27;s even the entire death and rebirth aspect: he is beaten, then stabbed as the final blow with a lethal weapon (like the spear of destiny), he falls (in a posture reminiscent of Jesus on the cross) and (nearly) dies before being rescued. Then he dies again, staying in coma (for days?) before rising again.<p>The symbolism is there, it&#x27;s easy to spot if you are looking for it but it blends in nicely enough that you can watch the film without paying any attention to it. It&#x27;s subtle enough that you can argue whether it&#x27;s symbolic or not and what is or isn&#x27;t intended to carry a metaphor. After all the film is intentionally corny and mostly sees itself as a sequel to the famous Superman series that preceded it by a few decades.<p>Then there&#x27;s Man of Steel. It doesn&#x27;t even try to hide its symbolism. Kal-El asks a priest in a church for guidance whether to surrender himself in front of a stained glass window showing Jesus asking Yahweh for guidance whether to surrender himself. Kal-El drops out of the spaceship to save mankind in a static Jesus pose. His father&#x27;s hologram (&quot;His&quot; &quot;Spirit&quot;) says that he sent his only son to save mankind. And so on and so forth. Not to mention the facepalm-inducing moments where Kal-El points out how all-American he is despite being an (immigrant) space alien. The American/Christian symbolism is so obtuse it was even used to market the film to Christian audiences. It&#x27;s less of a hidden allegory and more of a religious pamphlet.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to get at (other than Superman Returns clearly being the superior, if underrated, Superman movie and Man of Steel being a US-Christian circle jerk) is that there is a range. Some works of literature go out of their way to rub their symbolism in your face. In others it is present but more nuanced. In some it is subtle put still easy to find if you look for it. And in some any symbolism is merely a projection of what you are trying to find in it.<p>I would agree that most of the symbolism students of literary criticism tend to spend their energy on falls in the last category where you can show a work to handful of critics and get a lifetime&#x27;s worth of different interpretations.<p>But as much as I personally despise the field as a whole, some works do carry intentional symbolism. And some works unintentionally provide symbolism when read in certain contexts.<p>When you look at &quot;old&quot; literature (i.e. literature that has long outlived its authors), most of the literature that has survived to the modern day is literature that provided meaning across the various generations. It&#x27;s a legitimate question to ask &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how&quot; -- even if literary studies as a field tends to be more obsessed with the &quot;what&quot;.",1442006604

In practice that requirement can usually be fulfilled by simply providing a link someplace convenient to wherever you original got the code from yourself so it&#x27;s pretty easy to comply with. Additionally GPL and LGPL differ primarily in that GPL requires that code that uses it must itself be licensed under GPL, where as LGPL allows non-LGPL code to be linked to LGPL code (so long as the conditions of the LGPL code are still being met, primarily the distribution clause). The big difference between GPLv2 and GPLv3 was mostly about closing some loopholes that some companies (primarily TiVo) used to make it impossible to modify certain GPL code on their devices (mainly this involved using hardware DRM). This obviously violated the spirit of the GPL because the whole point is to allow for people to tinker with the code, and preventing that by coupling it to proprietary hardware as a end run around the GPL necessitated the creation of GPLv3 specifically to make doing that a violation of the license.",1442005599

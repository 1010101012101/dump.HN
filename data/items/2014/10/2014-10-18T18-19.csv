As new predictions come in, we adjust individual scores. We are planning to hide scores until a healthy number of predictions are made on that profile. That should help a bit on the dependency issue.

This is what happens in an ethereal format like the internet, and it&#x27;s something we&#x27;ll have to adapt to -- in the history of mass publication, one wasn&#x27;t able to just destroy all copies of a thing with the push of a button. Books and pamphlets could be hunted down, but almost always some would survive, because you can&#x27;t remotely change the contents of the paper. In the digital age, you <i>can</i>. If there&#x27;s a lesson to take from this, it&#x27;s the dangers of the non-permanence of the web; we should be looking at solutions that can mitigate that danger.

Sort the words and use levenshtein distance to correct unrecognized words to the nearest valid word, prior to doing the password hashing.  3 is slightly more difficult; for 7-of-8 you&#x27;d have to store 9 hashes, one for the full list, and 8 more hashes resulting from removing one of the 8 words.  What you gain in user friendliness costs you since you have to store several times the hashes, and you have to run multiple hash computations for each attempted login.<p>It should be noted that 1 and 3 both reduce entropy significantly.<p>A system that lets users omit one of the words in their passphrase will end up with users omitting one of the words all the time (why would you type more than you have to, particularly for passphrases of 20-40 characters?); the effective security of an 8 word passphrase with that system is worse than if it was a 7 word passphrase with no leeway for forgetting words.  With a strict comparison but a passphrase of one less word, attacker then has to guess the right 7 words.  By allowing a word to be forgotten, the attacker can guess any of 8 different 7-word passphrases and get in.<p>Any system that reminds you of the full passphrase has to store the passphrase unhashed (or equivalent, like, with each sub-hash, storing a hint for the missing word), which is unacceptable.",1413658141

8475976,comment,8475769,8475769,0,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> “There is a growing idea in Silicon Valley that there are sources of data on consumer behavior we can use to predict creditworthiness. These will be completely different than the traditional approach to credit ratings, which are tremendously imprecise and ‘laggy.’ PayPal can do a real-time credit score in milliseconds, based on your eBay purchase history — and it turns out that’s a better source of information than the stuff used to generate your FICO score.<p>Traditional credit ratings are &quot;tremendously imprecise&quot;? That&#x27;s an insane statement. FICO is a proven model and has weathered multiple business cycles. Virtually all of the alternative models being experimented with today haven&#x27;t. A lot of these models are going to fall apart when the current environment, which has seen record low credit default rates, changes.<p>I&#x27;d love to see a $50,000 auto loan or $400,000 mortgage approved on the basis of eBay purchase history alone.<p>> “The hypothesis is that there are many other similar sources of consumer data: credit card bills, social-network behavior, potentially even search history. Lots of people, both in the big Internet companies and at start-ups, are trying to get at these large pools of data and figure out new ways to do scoring. What they all have in common is that they are all being done outside of banks.<p>Notwithstanding the fact that credit payment history (&quot;credit card bills&quot;) <i>is</i> factored in to a FICO score, a couple of things should be pointed out:<p>1. Many of the companies trying different models are doing so in an attempt to serve thin file borrowers. Not surprisingly, established players like Fair Isaac aren&#x27;t sitting around twiddling their thumbs. They have their own solutions for these borrowers, like the FICO Expansion Score. Just because startups don&#x27;t want to pay for somebody else&#x27;s solution doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re the only ones innovating.<p>2. Credit scoring has never been a core bank function so Andreessen&#x27;s comment about this taking place outside of banks makes no sense and raises the question: does he even know what he&#x27;s talking about?<p>> “The minute any of these new credit vehicles can show any level of repeatability and reliability, the hedge funds come in and provide the funding. Hedge funds are very comfortable with analytic models. If you have sufficient stability, you can get leverage.”<p>The hedge funds are looking for yield. Putting aside the fact that a lot of this money is going to dry up when the interest rate environment changes, the hedge funds are less interested in analytic models and more interested in demand. In other words, it&#x27;s about customer acquisition. An underwriting model alone won&#x27;t cut it; you need to be able to find the borrowers.<p>Also, Andreessen seems to be viewing hedge fund participation as some sort of meaningful validation. Looking at hedge fund performance it should be obvious that most hedge funds are not &quot;smart money&quot; by any stretch of the imagination. When the current market turns, a lot of them will lose their shirts just as they did in 2008 betting big on junk like subprime mortgage-backed CDOs.<p>> “Bitcoin is like technology that’s arrived from Mars, and so regulators don’t know what to do with it. That’s a good thing. What a lot of financial technology entrepreneurs will tell you is that if you’re going to innovate in financial services, you want to do something so new and so different that the existing regulatory system doesn’t know how to react to you. That is your window of opportunity.<p>This is silly and untrue. In early 2013, FinCEN issued guidance for virtual currencies, and the IRS weighed in earlier this year. Not surprisingly, just because Bitcoin is &quot;new&quot; and &quot;different&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean that the standard rules and regulations don&#x27;t apply, as some have learned the hard way[1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/04/bitcoin-exchanger-charlie-shrem-pleads-guilty-to-silk-road-related-charges/15095129/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/04/bitcoin...</a>",1413657956

8475947,comment,8475633,8475633,0,0,kazinator,,,"Basically, the difference between Lisp conditions and exceptions in mainstream languages is this: the search for a <i>handler</i> is not conflated with <i>unwinding</i> the stack and performing a non-local transfer (the big jump from the throw site to the catch site).<p>When a condition occurs, the handling executes in a new stack frame, so to speak. The dynamic scope is searched for a handler, which is basically a lambda function associated with the type of the condition. When a handler is found it is called. A handler may &quot;decline&quot; the condition by returning, in which case the search continues. No information is thrown away.<p>Instead of returning, a handler may perform some kind of non-local transfer. For example, it can perform a &quot;sideways GO&quot; out of the closure to the surrounding function. There exist several ways in Lisp to do a nonlocal jump. The most commonly used one in the context of condition handling is the invocation of a <i>restart</i>.<p>Restarts, like handlers, also have bindings in the dynamic scope: bindings not between exception types and lambdas, but between symbols and lambdas. They resemble the catch/throw mechanism that is also available in Lisp, except that the functionality is richer. For instance, the Lisp program can query what restarts are available at a given point. Also, restart bindings can be conditionally made invisible.  Of course, restarts being functions, they take useful arguments.<p>A handler written by the application developer typically knows about certain restarts that are expected to be available.<p>A generic handler can simply enumerate all the restarts and whip them up into a menu that is presented to the user. &quot;This is what happened, and here are the available ways of continuing.&quot;<p>There is a lot of flexibility. For example, a handler can be something that is wrapped at some outer frame, and the set of restarts it interacts with can be inner. So, the inner code can effectively ask a handler for help: &quot;Oops, there is a problem, and I don&#x27;t know what to do: here are three ways to restart me.&quot;  The appropriate handler then basically chooses.<p>This could be used to implement authentication: a condition could indicate &quot;I need a password to continue&quot;, and a restart could be offered which takes a password, and another one which aborts the transaction.  The handler for the condition in some UI layer way above could provide a dialog for asking for the password, which then invokes the restart to continue with the password.<p>Conditions are not only for bailing out from errors, but for implementing protocols.<p>A good analogy is CPU exceptions. When a processor handles an exception, it doesn&#x27;t begin by unwinding the program. It saves as much of the processor state as possible so the program can be inspected as to what happened, and even restarted. This allows us to implement virtual memory: when a program triggers a page fault exception, the situation can be patched up and the program seamlessly restarted from that same instruction.<p>Lisp has a handler-case macro which simulates simplified exception handling in some block-structured languages. The handler-case macro writes lambda functions and binds them with condition types. The functions are written in such a way that they implicitly perform a non-local control transfer (such as via the aforementioned &quot;sideways GO&quot; to a label outside of the lambda). This GO is performed even before any of the body code is executed. So the effect is that the stack is unwound when the handler is found. Any frames between that frame and the origin of the condition are discarded, including any restarts that might have been available. With this, it is not possible to implement the scenario of some low level code asking for a password; the code is completely aborted (&quot;I didn&#x27;t have a password so I failed&quot;).",1413657242

8475945,comment,8475769,8475769,0,0,abalone,,,"<i>> Most consumer transactions are weighted with a 3 percent fee.</i><p>This is the single most fundamental misunderstanding in the bitcoin camp.<p>First of all it is only in some countries like the U.S. where fees are in the 2-3% range. Others have regulated that fee away already. In fact, the U.S. just recently regulated debit card interchange down to 0.05% + 21 cents.[1]<p>Second -- and this is really important -- most of that fee goes back to the consumer in the form of reward programs. That&#x27;s primarily what they are funding: 1-2% cash back programs, free travel, etc. Not the &quot;100,000 people and 1970s mainframe computers&quot; that Marc describes.<p>So, the opportunity to lower fees (1) doesn&#x27;t exist in many places, and (2) where it exists it consists of <i>taking value away from consumers</i>.<p>So no rational consumer will voluntarily transition over to  a lower-benefit instrument. If U.S. merchants really wanted to experiment with the future of &quot;lower fees&quot;, just try accepting debit cards only (not credit cards). See how consumer like it. Great for merchants, not so much for customers who want their cashback programs.<p>Even where lower fees have been forced through regulations (Australia), it did not result in a general 2-3% reduction in consumer prices. Guess what, merchants kept that margin.[2] This is why big merchants like Walmart are resisting Apple Pay in a futile effort to push their own CurrentC, a new instrument that bypasses card networks and deducts directly from your checking account. But guess what: it <i>takes value away from consumers</i>. Exactly the same problem with bitcoin for consumer payments.<p>This is why it will have an extremely tough time replacing credit cards -- and that&#x27;s before we even get to the matter of consumer protections. You need a trusted intermediary to be able to enforce chargebacks, which protect consumers against ripoffs. You can&#x27;t do it with insurance alone; you have to be able to reverse transactions. So by the time you add intermediaries back in, Bitcoin is just another centralized card network with an exotic protocol for moving money. It&#x27;s the next Discover card, sans card.<p>There may be more specific niches where bitcoin is useful. But this notion that bitcoin will save us all 3% on purchases is just plain uninformed. And unfortunately it&#x27;s at the foundation of so much of the investment in this area.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.heartlandpaymentsystems.com/Durbin/What-is-the-durbin-amendment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heartlandpaymentsystems.com/Durbin/What-is-the-du...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.competitionpolicyinternational.com/assets/Hot-Tubs/Interchange-Fees-web.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.competitionpolicyinternational.com/assets/Hot-Tu...</a><p><i>&quot;Another predictable result is the absence of evidence that consumer prices have fallen as a result of lower merchant discounts.

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s out of maliciousness, but it&#x27;s just reality.<p>It&#x27;s a rare boss that actually cares enough to guide you and to push you to make your career better, because that means they will be losing you.

They will pay me well and treat me well if I make their lives easier, ie. add new features, fix bugs, handle customer escalations, and I&#x27;m grateful for this because they&#x27;ve treated me very well.<p>But things like raises, career growth, it&#x27;s rare that managers think too much about this, because it&#x27;s precisely the type of thing that makes their life worse, because if you grow out of your current role, they will lose you.<p>The other part of this equation is that you need to be able to properly evaluate yourself.  If you&#x27;re just average, then you deserve market rate, because you&#x27;re easily replaced.  But 80% of all people think they are above average, which causes friction.

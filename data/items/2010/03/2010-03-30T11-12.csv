Many of them have described Tuesday's event as the beginning of a ""new era in science"".<p>We don't often hear things like that in hard sciences like physics. For thousands of years, humans have been ""discovering"" nature and trying to piece together a puzzle.<p>> ""If you want to discover new particles, you have to produce them; and these new particles are massive...""<p>We're no longer sitting by idly, waiting to find the next piece so we can fit it somewhere. Humans are making the next piece, whatever it may be. Not to use the oft abused phrase lightly, I think this is a paradigm shift in our study of sciences where we've taken serendipity out of the equation and replaced it with engineering. LHC isn't a science project. It is the industrialization of discovery, for at the scale they are operating, it has to be.<p>Personally, I highly doubt we'll find Higgs anytime soon or ever.

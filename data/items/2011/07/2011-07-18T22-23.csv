Product Manager for Datasheets.com from SiliconExpert here.
Good to hear your perspective.<p>Datasheets.com has direct relationships with hundreds of electronic manufacturers and dozens of distributors. As such, the likelihood of finding a part number on datasheets.com is greater than any single distributor/manufacturer website by itself. I would encourage you to try a search. Let us know how it goes.<p>Also, Google searches for part numbers can at times provide non-electronic industry related results. Simple example: search for ""DMV"" on Google and you will most likely receive results for the Department of Motor Vehicles. Search for ""DMV"" on datasheets.com and you'll see results for Diode families from electronic manufacturers.<p>The difference really is between horizontal vs vertical search engines.",1311029804

When bigotry began to appear on reddit, the reddit founders did nothing to combat it (and, indeed, slightly encouraged it). At the time, I think it would have been fairly easy to contain.<p>At this point, I'm not sure what can be done, since now bigots form a substantial portion of the reddit community.<p>For example, there was this guy named Lou Franklin who was probably the biggest bigot in the history of the site, and they took YEARS to finally ban his account.",1311029372

If the school knowingly encourages cheating for profit, I would think integrity demands playing whistleblower.  In fact, I'd apply that to <i>any</i> organization knowningly doing something shady -- bring it to light or accept guilt as an accomplice.<p>If the school believes in academic integrity, but the compensation for teachers results in perverse incentives, it is important to do the right thing anyway--defend the academic integrity of the school, work on fixing the system, and in the mean time put social pressure on other teachers to do the right thing until the system is fixed.<p>I agree that it's not the professor's responsibility to pursue the matter beyond his influence at the school.  If there's an office of academic honesty, but it's lax, the best he can do is lobby to improve it.  But inasmuch as professors have absolute control over the grades they distribute, I do think they have a responsibility to be fair with them.<p>I can see leaving an institution over a lack of academic honesty.  I can see working to reform or improve one.  I can see failing a student for cheating, but washing your hands of it when the school does nothing further.

This isn't just manual laborers, but applies to skilled/educated labor forces too. The intellectual side of America has <i>always</i> been driven by immigration, and this has never been more true than the post-WW2 era. Look at your local university's academics - how many them are first-generation or second-gen immigrants? NASA is practically built out of foreign scientists. And closer to home, what's the representation of immigrants in the tech industry compared to the population at large?<p>The locals <i>always</i> underperform compared to people willing to scrabble and fight because they've had a tougher background. So unless you have a plan to make locals competitive (beyond simply ""raise the wages!""), this seems an inevitable move.<p>> <i>""This can be handled with tariffs, like we do with sugar.""</i><p>Ah, so you hope to fight free market capitalism with tariffs... Okay, so let's go with your plan and raise manual labor wages such that people actually <i>want</i> to be farm hands.<p>Then we go <i>way</i> out of our way to essentially ban foreign imports, or make them so expensive that everyone <i>must</i> use domestic substitutes. We become an enclosed economy so we don't have to face competitive pressures from outside. You're an economy in a bottle, and you better damn pray you have <i>everything</i> you could ever want within your own borders... because as soon as you leave more competitive countries will eat you for lunch.<p>What part of that sounds like sound economic policy?<p>> <i>""you're literally importing an underclass that is ethnically, culturally, and linguistically different from the majority. That never ends well.""</i><p>Isn't this the crux of your argument? You seem to believe this is a bad thing - I fail to see how this can be the case. If this country eventually just starts speaking Spanish as a first-language, what's wrong with that? So what if burritos eventually replace hamburgers as the national staple... in fact this has already happened in some places to no ill effect.<p>I used to live in Toronto, Canada, where a whopping <i>50%</i> of the population is immigrant. Pandemonium has not ensued, and instead the country is a stronger, more interesting, and more diverse place for it. Xenophobia has no place in modern economic policy.<p>Even looking beyond principles of equality, protectionist laws are just <i>plain bad ideas</i> because you're only staving off the inevitable and making things worse. If there is a coder out there right now who's better than me, wants 10% of my pay, and is willing to bust his ass to do so... come hell or high water there's not a force in the world sufficient to stop him from competing with me.",1311028805

For them, unemployment is closer to 3% right now. Most of that 9.2% is out of work because demand is weak. People's skills didn't suddenly become obsolete at the stroke of midnight sometime in 2008.

If an inquest finds that a death was in fact a homicide, then the coroner's findings are handed over to the Crown Prosecution Service, which operates similarly to an American prosecutor's office.

This is a sorry state of affairs: given that our time is limited and ticking away, the tasks upon the table should always include some consideration of aging. What can we do about it? How can we engineer a research community, funding and support to make real progress within our lifetimes?

Most of these apps feel like they've only been handled by causal users.<p>The worst memory was in GIMP working with layer sizing and floating objects, so many things were fixed and required hunting through menus or googling shortcuts to get them to resize or to place an object out of edit mode. The equivalent in photoshop is the enter key, or automatic layer boundary resizing, etc. The application does a much better job of staying out of your way.<p>If you're noodling about with a few photos its no big deal but the first major file I had to tackle with a few dozen layers and objects burned me out completely.

On the surface it gives you a great framework for creating a website that works in a certain way but if you deviate from that you tend to find yourself in trouble.<p>In our case it was mostly the admin section that created the issues. I'm sure that if you know the framework well enough there are ways around the inflexibility but the fact of the matter is, the Django admin is heavily based on configuration. Where you have configuration you have limitations.<p>Things may have changed (it was about a year ago when I last worked with it) but at the time I struggled with simple things like; customising the auth system, easy debugging / error handling, clean outgoing email switching between dev / live, the templating system, etc. I seem to recall spending most of my time ripping code from the core framework into my views.py and tweaking it so I could get the behaviour the client was asking for.<p>As I say, it's been a while since I worked with it and I'm sure people have solutions to the issues I encountered but if you're planning on going off piste at all it's probably not for you.",1311026558

Perhaps some sort of competition could be arranged as well.<p>If it didnt include any specifics it could be made public, even for non-public projects.

Of course hard to compare this between projects, but would be fun to see how work progresses for past collegues and within teams as well.<p>Anything like this available?

But if the effort to hack it is hundreds of times more difficult than the possible payoff from hacking it (which appears to be the case for nearly anybody but James Bond), then it acts as a serious security mechanism for that user&#x27;s context. Literally nobody is going to make a mold of my finger to unlock my iPhone  they&#x27;d have to be absolutely insane to think that was worthwhile. So it&#x27;s a serious security mechanism for me. Would it be a serious security mechanism to cover nuclear launch codes? Of course not.",1380661155

A few months ago I looked into getting gevent-socketio up and running to do real-time messaging between a Flask app and an iOS app. gevent-socketio provides event handling and a messaging protocol on top of websockets that I thought would be useful.<p>However, based on my testing, in its current state it&#x27;s nowhere near ready for production. There are some serious bugs relating to memory leaks, improperly closing stale sockets, and deployment on Gunicorn with # workers > 1 is not currently possible. (And in practice I don&#x27;t think you would want to deploy on anything besides Gunicorn.) The project also seems to be somewhat inactive, there are a lot of open critical issues and there hasn&#x27;t been any real activity in the last 6 months or so.<p>At this point I am considering removing the library and using a straight websocket implementation with a simpler protocol instead.",1380660526

If the House properly represented the people, it would have a majority that would pass the Senate bill. If the House had its current makeup but could actually vote on the Senate bill, rather than only voting on bills approved by a majority of the majority party, the Senate bill would pass. Instead, because the rules conspire to make it so that you have to please at least half of the legislators from a party that got a minority of the vote, we get jerked around by people who mostly do not represent us, both in terms of sharing our values, and in the more direct term of being someone we voted for or against.<p>This is not a consequence of representative democracy, it is a <i>failure</i> of it.",1380659950

My community college (De Anza) has been known as a &quot;federal school&quot; for UC Berkeley and UCLA, yet very few of my classmates took that route. I wondered why, but came to the same conclusion: unless you&#x27;re strongly motivated and self-disciplined, it&#x27;s too easy to fall through the cracks in a community college (no requirement to graduate by a certain date, no  financial pressure, no residential learning, no exam study sessions, etc...). To me the desire to study upper division math/physics/EE/CS is what drove me;  was already used to working independently and learning from textbooks.  On the other hand, those who have always studied in groups, who didn&#x27;t have quite a clear educational or career goals in mind tended, or who were not used to having clearly spelled out requirements (&quot;you complete these classes in four years with this GPA, otherwise you can&#x27;t get in&quot; vs. &quot;these sets of universities demand these classes and  usually accept students these with these GPAs&quot;) would languish, either dropping out without transferring, transferring only after 4+ (3 years was very common), or doing poorly once they&#x27;ve transferred.<p>As is think MOOCs and any other high-autonomy self-structured educational programs are of great benefit[1] to autodidacts with great motivation and self-discipline. However, nothing says they can&#x27;t be combined with traditional teaching environment. As an example, consider the case of Calculus -- it&#x27;s the foundation of all modern mathematics; you <i>have to</i> get it to study all even slightly quantitative disciplines from Computer Science to Political Science. Yet, we entrust its teaching to high-school AP (or IB for rest of the English speaking courses) teaches or graduate TAs. With MooCs we could have these classes taught by professors distinguished for their teaching ability, but conducted with the structure of a regular high-school/lower-division college environment.<p>... or take the case of a machine learning, a specialized and quickly evolving discipline. A small university might only have a single professor who specialized in it, but she may not have the resources to teach the class (or teach enough sections of the class). She would, however, likely have the resources to organize an experience around a MOOCs and assist the MOOC students.",1380659778

From artists, fans, and venues to management, promoters, and patrons of the arts, I hope to strengthen and catalyze the business and creative ecosystem from the inside out in ways that no one has done before. The help and opinions of the members of HN are greatly appreciated and valued.<p>The following Survey of Your Musical Life will ask you general questions about who you are, what your listening habits are, and what social media you use. From there it asks specific questions tailored to how you participate in the music industry (performing artist, fan, management, promoter, patron etc.). The survey is a bit long, but one person as described it as &quot;pleasantly introspective&quot; already so perhaps it will be a nice journey for you!<p>Anyone can take the survey so please share it freely. As a token of my gratitude, upon completion you can provide your email address to become a beta tester after we launch, subscribe to product updates (no spam, I promise), or even enter in a random drawing for $50!<p>So please give about 25 minutes of your time to support me and entrepreneurship in the arts.

Most Python devs (myself included) are sticking to the newer 2x releases because<p>- things work perfectly well in 2x
- 2x is still actively developed
- we can pull down 3x behavior from &#x27;future&#x27; when wanted
- no one is putting a gun to heads to make people upgrade
- python isn&#x27;t client side.  if you can&#x27;t make up your mind or ship correctly, that&#x27;s on you, the dev<p>Which is to say, I don&#x27;t see how this reflects poorly on the language.  If a developer feels that he needs to support Cpython 2 and 3, that&#x27;s his own deal because he could pick one and bundle his application appropriately.<p>Now for JS, you don&#x27;t really get a say as a front-end dev because the client is in charge of what interpreter he brings to the table.

6210073,comment,6207622,6207937,6,0,buro9,,,"As a counter-anecdote I purchased 2 fitbit ultras, and the aria scales and had nothing but trouble with all of them.<p>The fitbit ultra has a design flaw that means that if you wear them in a trouser pocket and then cycle, that they can deal with the twisting flexing motion. This results in popping the plastic case open and exposing the internals (electronics) to the elements, thus rendering them useless in all but fine weather when you&#x27;re walking.<p>The aria scales have a fundamental design flaw that makes them incompatible with small apartments/flats. They expect to be stored flat, and calibrate over several weigh-ins. If you really have a small apartment, and small bathroom (as nearly everyone in London that I know of does) then you need to store them upright and lay them flat to use them.<p>The effect of that is that they never calibrate and weigh-ins seconds apart where they have been upright in-between can vary by as much as +/- 1.5kg on every weight-in. This makes them absolutely useless as scales... even if the accuracy wasn&#x27;t there, consistency would have still left us with a predictability that allowed them to have some utility.<p>I tried to `reach out` to Eric (the founder) in addition to the support people about both issues, including reproducible steps to demonstrate the design assumptions that rendered the scales useless.<p>I feel to this day that they released a little tested alpha product and not a finished one. All I got back was an automatic offer to replace with a new one, and later (I was insistent they had a design flaw and clear about the effects of it) an acknowledgement that they were not going to update the firmware of the scales to pre-calibrate each weigh-in (which is what every other electric scale I&#x27;ve ever seen actually does).<p>My investment in every fitbit product turned out to be a waste of my money and time.<p>My investment in time, trying to tell them the issues as someone who cared about them getting it right turned out to be a waste too.<p>I tried the quantified self with fitbit and their version of it failed spectacularly.<p>I now strongly recommend Nike and Withings to everyone who will listen. I should point out I run one of the largest cycling web-sites in the world and this testing was done very publicly, 36,000 cyclists now know not to touch fitbit. I <i>wanted</i> fitbit to win, and that was why I so cockily did tried their range publicly. Nike and Strava (with Android) are the big winners within that community, with a few nods to Jawbone Up. Fitbit was tried by others with similar experience to mine... everyone I know who touched a fitbit has given away, for free, their fitbit hardware. It&#x27;s worthless to us.",1376458942

The source code to the parser is very assert-heavy, so if there&#x27;s anything that&#x27;s amiss, it tends to blow up with an assertion failure.  I&#x27;d run the MapReduce and it would blow up a few hundred times, then MapReduce would stop trying and kill the job.  Then when I had a spare moment, I&#x27;d look at the assertion failures, pick off the most common ones, and run it again.  This time it would get farther, I&#x27;d pick off another couple of bugs, and run it again.<p>As expected, the triggering frequency of bugs follows a power-law distribution.  It took a long time before I could get it to parse <i>one</i> HTML document, and then it would fail on 1% of documents, then 0.1% of documents, then 0.01%, and so on.  It got stuck at a roughly 1-in-a-million failure rate by a long time, until I figured out that it was crashing because of a stack overflow in the <i>testing</i> code, which would recursively sanity-check the produced DOM.  Some documents generate a DOM >20,000 nodes deep, which is evidently too much to fit in typical C stacks, although Gumbo can handle them.  (I found one page with a DOM tree 100,000 nodes deep - it was really an XML document masquerading as HTML, with a bunch of self-closing nodes that don&#x27;t self-close under HTML5 parsing rules - and when I posted the link to say &quot;Look what I found!&quot;, I got a bunch of &quot;Kind of a dick move, linking to a page that crashes Webkit.&quot;)",1376458724

There was no shortage of drama when Linus refused to upgrade the Linux license to GPLv3.<p>Tivoization removes the freedom to modify your software (and still have it run).  Again, quoting the FSF about tivoization:<p><a href=""https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a><p>> Freedom 1 includes the freedom to use your changed version in place of the original.

This is not sufficient. In other words, these binaries are not free software even if the source code they are compiled from is free.<p>I don&#x27;t know what else to say.  The FSF writes, &quot;these binaries are not free software&quot;.  They&#x27;re referring to Tivoized Linux binaries.  They get to make up the rules here.

And to refer to the major architectural differences between the two as something that could be bridged by a single &quot;patch&quot; is a little silly.<p>gcc is still better at optimization, though.  For now.<p>[edit: wow, people are really confused here.  Guys, LLVM was designed from the start to have a clean separation between passes.  You can compile some other language to the LLVM bytecode and then just use the code generator, for example.  It even includes a JIT!  In contrast, gcc is a huge monolith.  The projects are written in different languages, too... C++ versus C.<p>tl;dr is that when you say that &quot;the only difference is the license,&quot; you sound like someone saying &quot;the only difference between Ruby and Java is the file extension.&quot;  Pointy haired.]",1376457500

A personal anecdote (that at least I still chuckle about):<p>I was working for a start up about about 5 years ago working on a the reporting system for measuring customer metrics, the data was granular enough that we allowed the customer to drill down to the per-hour activity level. As a result it was deemed important to represent the data in the customer&#x27;s  timezone. To &quot;future proof&quot; the system we had a table indicating when to shift an hour for daylight savings time. I populated the table to go out 25 years I think. My manager asked me &quot;what happens in 2033?&quot;. But after a moment of thought he came to the same conclusion you did and 25 years was deemed sufficient.",1376457247

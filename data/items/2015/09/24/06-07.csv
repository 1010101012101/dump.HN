For example, you have to build a web app. So you start implementing a little framework (things you like) and then use it to finish the project. That way it takes more time but you enjoy it. I found out over the years, taking into account all my good, mediocre and bad results, that I did my best work when I enjoyed it, as silly as it sounds. It doesn&#x27;t matter that I waste 50% of the time if I get the job done and enjoy it. The alternative is to do it even slower and disgusted.<p>I think procrastination is a kind of anxiety. We enjoy the creative parts and fear the complexities of debugging that monster when it&#x27;s 99% done. We need to switch back to enjoyment to get in the flow. That means doing things you like, instead of things you should do, but we can be smart and try to combine the two things.<p>Another example: I had to work on an old script that was really ugly and messy. I took a day to refactor the old codebase, clean it up, just so I don&#x27;t see it as a scary monster any more. Then I was much more likely to work on it.",1443077991

In the case of VW, it&#x27;s the NOx limits that they were cheating on. In order to reduce NOx, you can run a richer air/fuel mixture, which consumes more fuel and is thus inefficient.<p>If you&#x27;re instead talking about C02, then you&#x27;re generally right. Efficiency and cleanliness are aligned.<p>And my original comment could probably be rephrased as, &quot;fast, clean, efficient, reliable, cheap: pick any three&quot;.

10270250,comment,10266060,10266060,0,0,IKnowNothingBut,,,"I guess the reason we have QRs is because we are not yet there to determine what is the object in question. QR technology makes it easier by providing a unique tag for each object. So now when you see the QR code, your QR reader can access the look-up table to find what particular object it is.<p>The proposed technology is one step ahead of existing QR systems. But I guess the end goal to identify objects, and making a one to one association would be very cool. For Ex - when you want to identify people, you do not want them to come with QR code. Putting a name tag is something I will do to introduce myself in conferences so that people can recognize me from distance. But Ideally I would like that they recognize me by my face :)",1443077920

Assuming one thousand /48 are allocated every second (ie. one thousand &quot;business&quot; IPv6 users coming online per second, which might be absolutely plausible 100+ years from now --we made IPv6 to be future proof right?), then we would run out of allocatable blocks in the global unicast IPv6 space (2000::/3) in 1,115 years. And we would run out of allocatable blocks in the entire IPv6 space in 8,919 years. So, yeah, I get annoyed when people mention the &quot;death of the sun&quot; or the &quot;lifetime of the universe&quot; when talking about IPv6, when in fact we could start running into exhaustion issues in the next ~1000 years.<p>Note that I am being pedantic here.

That ease of production inevitably leads to a much greater supply than the market can handle.<p>I believe software is on the same path. Ten, twenty years ago, to create, distribute, and market software was a complex undertaking involving many actors. But now motivated software developers can release and market products with much greater ease than even shareware producers experienced in the 1990&#x27;s.<p>Seven years ago I released my main software product (poker hand tracking and analysis for OS X), a niche product within a niche market.

There has been insufficient pure research into software development practices, software design patterns and features, and so on in regards to what is required and what is beneficial when it comes to creating control software and firmware.

Feel free to clarify/reply; I check thread replies on HN every couple days, hopefully others chime in too.<p>The most popular methods to teach language put an incredibly strong emphasis on the link between visual glyphs and the sounds they&#x27;re associated with. This technique seems highly practical on the surface because it aligns reading and talking, so effort in one area leads to reward in the other.<p>This system isn&#x27;t perfect (or IMO acceptable/sane), though, because by design, it doesn&#x27;t teach/provide an &quot;off-switch&quot; for when you want to do one without the other; rather, it conveys the opposite idea that one always implies the other. So either you intuitively figure out the nuances of where and how to differentiate visual and audial yourself, or you end up learning there are kids in the classroom who who can&#x27;t read silently because they &quot;don&#x27;t get&quot; (read: weren&#x27;t taught) how to do that.<p>And then we crash into the whole maximum reading thing speed a few years later, which is so subtle and innate that most people don&#x27;t even realize they have the issue at all. Just like with silently reading, a lucky few retain enough intuition to keep the visual and audial side of things completely separate in spite of how they were (mis)taught: one of my friends has the ability to look at (ie, read) his entire laptop screen as a single whole. (Of course I&#x27;ve signed up for lessons :P but it remains to be seen whether I can learn... <i>that</i>.)<p>But that&#x27;s what speedreading is: reading <i>purely visually</i>, not with the clunky, time-based words->sounds->comprehension thing.<p>Quite possibly, as you read this, you&#x27;re hearing it in your speaking voice or a mental voice. Not only is that capability innately time-based, rendering accent, tone and pause use mental resources.<p>With effort, you can consistently turn this off. It&#x27;s just <i>really really</i> hard to learn to, 1) because we&#x27;ve been doing it all our lives and 2) because it was ingrained so early.<p>I understand that comprehension speed can go through the roof once this is done, because using the visual parts of the brain to process reading directly - ie, skipping glyphs->sounds->comprehension and going straight to glyphs->comprehension - is basically <i>the</i> way to do it. Sadly, only very few people to this.<p>The read-slow technique is a new one to me, but it seems to work, sort of. A better method I&#x27;ve also read about is to bog-down the sound processing parts of the brain with an activity that completely occupies all sound processing: repeating a sequence of letters over and over, like &quot;A B C A B C A B C A B C ...&quot; while you read. The visual and audial parts of the brain both ultimately do reach the comprehension parts, but the audial parts have the most connections. Bogging down audial processing with a task like the one above means you fall back on the visual->comprehension connections... which is what you want.<p>Rebalancing everything so comprehension is predominantly visual... yeah, that would definitely the subject of some efficiency research, because without some kind of secret-sauce learning method I&#x27;d imagine it would take years.",1443075511

So you setup django as usual: REST framework with the normal REST API endpoints.<p>For client-side, everything works as normal: The React code starts with static values for state/props that are pre-populated (ie. the return value for getInitialState was already determined during server-side rendering). Upon app updates (eg. user interaction), the app will make asynchronous calls to the correct REST endpoints -- perhaps batched, as you mention.  Client-side is the &quot;easy&quot; part of this one. :)<p>For server-side rendering you have a normal HTTPresponse-returning Django view (eg. for /). That view compiles/renders the React JSX &quot;template&quot; in NodeJS. Only for server-side, when you call renderToString to get the initial HTML, getInitialState is actually a series of REST requests (in javascript) which are batched, sent to django, and returned (map-style) to node as JSON for initial rendering.<p>Two questions:<p>(1) Does the REST request batching get sent to a different, special endpoint for batching?

It&#x27;s not purely the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, either. There&#x27;s another encyclopedia founded at the same time (both 1995), the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy [1], with a broadly similar mission and also quite a lot of good articles (though fewer than 1500). And there&#x27;s an excellently organized, continually updated bibliography of philosophy papers, PhilPapers [2]. It&#x27;s run like the original Yahoo, a big directory with manually curated topic areas. In computer science, we haven&#x27;t managed to build resources like these.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.iep.utm.edu/home/about/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iep.utm.edu/home/about/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://philpapers.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philpapers.org/</a>",1443074749

It&#x27;s actually called a &quot;utility function&quot; because the utility varies depending on the inputs, including time, number of units, etc.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say you&#x27;ve always wanted to go skydiving. You pay $500 and go skydiving. It&#x27;s a great value to you. But when you get back to the ground, would you pay $500 to do it again? Probably not, since the utility of going skydiving has dropped for you (because you crossed it off your bucket list), even though the price has stayed the same.<p>Now imagine the price for skydiving has dropped to $25. You might go again. Heck, you might go every day for a week. But after a while, the novelty wears off, and you won&#x27;t go anymore. Even if the price drops to free.<p>In fact, if someone was forcing you to go skydiving every day, you might even PAY to do something else instead.<p>On the other hand, maybe you need to skydive every day because you are trying to qualify as a stuntman. That means the utility of being qualified is greater than the negative utility of &quot;boredom from too much skydiving&quot;.<p>Or maybe you NEVER go skydiving because you went base jumping several years prior, and skydiving seems similar enough that it&#x27;s just not worth $500 to you.<p>Trying to representing these trade-offs with only money is confusing and/or impossible. Try to work out the &quot;boredom&quot; example using only money: Someone can know they get more utility from X than Y, but not be able to express prices for X and Y.",1443074697

They&#x27;d just attribute it to some bad individual.<p>There&#x27;s something about race that leads people to try to make incidents like these representative of broader societal forces. I understand why -- we have a pretty poor history of downplaying and ignoring victims of ongoing institutional implicit racism, such as the police treatment of black communities, and it&#x27;s important to remind people of that when we see it.<p>But I can also empathize with those that dislike extrapolations of systemic racism with so many of these types of events, because it implies that somehow we are all to blame for allowing a culture like this to fester, when in reality sometimes there are just racist assholes out there.",1439884530

Also, holy crap is it fast--instant results.<p>Some initial reactions/suggestions:<p>- I want to be able to edit entries in a list in-line.  When I looked at it on my Android phone, each word&#x27;s link was separated which made me think I could click each element individually to change it in place vs. having to re-enter it on the right panel.  Think of it like Google or Pinterest&#x27;s search interface where you modify individual words in place vs. doing it somewhere separate. For modifying integers, you could even use a dropdown or scroll menu on mobile since numbers would likely be relatively low.<p>- When I have the input field selected, pause the animation. In fact, maybe make it stop looping once I&#x27;ve entered one or a couple things.  It is distracting and I&#x27;ve shown I understand how to use the box.  Instead, consider putting static text examples somewhere below--an input key if you will.<p>- You have an engaging hook--let me take the next step of engagement.  Add user accounts and the ability to save lists as recipe&#x27;s or shopping lists, share them, and list the most popular ones based on shares. Instant boost to k-factor.<p>- In the list below the bar graph, I&#x27;d love to see line-item nutritional stats (perhaps marked by corresponding graph series color) for contribution of total calories of that type.  For example, I have a smoothie recipe with 1C almond milk in it.  Without clicking on it, I should be able to see displayed both the absolute values as well as the percentage of total recipe calories, carbs, fat and protein the line item is adding.<p>- Let me make lists of lists, list of lists of lists, etc.--ie. menu planning. A list is a recipe, a list of lists is the menu, a list of lists of lists is a weekly meal plan that would be awesome to plug into Amazon Fresh or something of the sort (if it had an API). Let me buy n-deep lists with a click.<p>- Consider showing the source of the data for users to verify or investigate further.  If I am substituting something for one of your entries though that you don&#x27;t have, I should be able to enter my own custom items as well as their nutritional information. This obviously is easier to implement for individual users and their shared recipes vs. incorporating in to your master lookup data.<p>- The mobile interface is slick, but I&#x27;d love a native app down the line as well.<p>- Let me upload a photo(s)--particularly on mobile where I might have made something, want to snap a photo, toss together the recipe quickly, and share it out.  Think Instagram for recipes.<p>Would love to know more details about the project.<p>1. What did you use for building the front/back ends?<p>2. How did you make it so blazing fast?<p>3. What&#x27;s your data source?<p>4. What made you decide to launch this? Consider adding an &quot;About&quot; page.<p>Awesome stuff.",1439884097

Google Spreadsheets sort of does (the UX is lacking, though) but then again hardly any company will even consider putting sensitive data in the cloud and rightfully so.<p>Even convincing users to use complementary tools that improve Excel-based processes might be difficult because due to prolonged, habitual (ab)use many users don&#x27;t even see the problems that arise anymore (&quot;Why change this? It&#x27;s always been done this way.&quot;). Implementing such tools in a way they&#x27;re accepted by users is hard. You can&#x27;t just add Git or some acceptance testing framework to the flow and expect users to be happy with that.

Compromising the process is compromising the the process for all containers.<p>For security purposes there&#x27;s a big difference between starting with access to everything and then trying to reign in processes, access, resources etc compared to starting with hardware isolation and then <i>allowing</i> some functions (e.g. management) to cross.<p>Microsoft is completely correct on this: Containers are <i>not</i> security boundaries. A security boundary would require very few access points with very specific security policies. That is not containers.<p>Hyper-V virtual machines, on the other hand, enjoy hardware level isolation and starts from the other end: Anything that should cross the VM boundary has to be explicitly allowed, as opposed to OS virtualization where anything is allowed until the projection disallows it.<p>For instance, a container could try to delay processing of callbacks from the kernel processes. It is the same process as the others containers, and a single malicious container could very well starve the others for resources.<p>Both have their uses.

With difficulty and being mindful of the sharp edges, you can use OpenPGP on desktop. You need a clunky third-party email client to get it on mobile. Best case scenario, you send lots of extra data that gets ignored. Worst case, all those attached signatures get downloaded as files, causing confusion and anger. And there’s no interoperability with S/MIME, which actually is supported by most proprietary email clients.<p>OpenPGP does not protect metadata. It piggybacks on SMTP, which publishes the sender, recipient, and subject line in the clear, along with the identity and timing of each server in the transport path from when you send the email to when it lands in your recipient’s mailbox.

Over a 20 year period that&#x27;s 5x. I&#x27;d tune that down to 4x given there&#x27;s risks and historical returns have been better than they probably will in the future.

(California does quite nicely and is on the upper end of this spectrum). About a third you get back from the gov, so in a 20 year period in Cali, investing $15k (subsidies included) you may get $30k-$35k in savings if you go solar.<p>It&#x27;s really nice but it doesn&#x27;t beat the market, and most states have cheaper rates than California which is like 30% above average and much fewer sun hours, and less competition, too.

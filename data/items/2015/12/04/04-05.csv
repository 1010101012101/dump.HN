This represents 2.8% of all music sold in that year. However, just a year later, in 2012, that percentage fell to 2.2%. It rose slightly to 2.3% in 2013 before falling once again to just 2% in 2014.<p>That 2% represents just 5.2 million albums sold by all jazz artists in 2014. In comparison, the best-selling artist of 2014, Taylor Swift, sold 3.7 million copies of her latest album ‘1989’ in the last 2 months of 2014 alone. ...&quot;<p><a href=""http://thejazzline.com/news/2015/03/jazz-least-popular-music-genre/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thejazzline.com/news/2015/03/jazz-least-popular-music...</a>",1449205174

A prosecutor should have to earn a conviction. However I also feel strongly that perpetrators of some crimes, upon conviction, should face harsh punishments.<p>Earlier this week, we got a message from a defense attorney inquiring about our services to assist with a criminal case. There were no other details left, so we googled the attorney and found that this attorney is involved in a very high-profile criminal case defending someone accused of an <i>extremely</i> heinous crime. It&#x27;s a Law and Order-type crime, and it happens to be in one of the category crimes that I find to be particularly egregious.<p>I&#x27;m torn. The part of me that believes in the right to a strong defense wants to assist, not necessarily because I support the defendant, but because the prosecutor shouldn&#x27;t be a rubber stamp. The other part is wondering what happens if I help defendant get off and he hurts someone else.<p>We left a message with the attorney asking for more detail and haven&#x27;t heard back. It may be that the attorney found someone else, decided our field won&#x27;t help, or maybe just can&#x27;t afford us. But if we do hear back, if we are able to assist, and if the attorney does want to retain us, I don&#x27;t know how we&#x27;ll respond.<p>I hope I have the courage to say yes.

If charitable gifts weren&#x27;t tax-deductible the equivalent would have been paying $30 in taxes and having $70 left over to give to charity (for same $100 loss).  The tax-advantaged status gives charitable gifts an extra bang-for-your-buck by giving you same net result (total outgo of $100) while allowing you to direct all $100 to the charity of your choice.<p>Also, notice that you&#x27;re not somehow &quot;getting something back&quot; from other taxpayers in this scenario.

It happened due to a strategic partnership with the US and Japan. Many Japanese were sent to US universities to be educated on Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Computer Science. In addition, Japan received a significant amount of funding from the US to bootstrap their developing economy which later grew into a manufacturing powerhouse.<p>Currently. Japan is a developed nation at a peak of its manufacturing capacity with a decreasing working population and increasing non-working population.<p>Aside from Macro Economic constraints, there are some very real cultural barriers hurting their competitive standing on the international stage.<p>First, even with a population boom the only way to sustain current production capacity is to open the borders to immigration. People outside Japan are very interested in moving their to work/live but widespread xenophobia is still a very real problem.<p>Second, the public perception that the Japanese work ethic is poisoned by too much emphasis on perception over production.<p>I can&#x27;t speak on the reality of living/working in Japan because I&#x27;ve never been there but I have seen numerous videos and posts lately by western tech workers who have. The popular consensus seems to be, &quot;Japan is an amazing place to be but I&#x27;d never stay there long-term.&quot;<p>From what I can tell, the culture encourages people to work extremely long hours at a great personal expense whether or not that time is productive. Time is filled with &#x27;busy work&#x27; that&#x27;s neither essential nor intellectually satisfying. To spend less time at work than your boss is considered shameful to the point that those who don&#x27;t conform will be stigmatized for unsatisfactory performance. 10-12 hour days and/or being required to join the boss/coworkers after work for drinks are the norm, not the exception. Unsat performance reviews make it impossible to move up the latter and/or get hired at another company so there&#x27;s no choice but to conform.<p>Either one of these issues will deter any sane high-skilled worker from immigrating to Japan. Both are beyond recourse.<p>Silicon Valley (and the US tech centers in general) have a huge advantage in that they attract top talent from around the world. Not only is acquiring the top talent important for success but bringing people from diverse backgrounds encourages the cross-pollination of ideas.<p>I&#x27;m not saying these guys won&#x27;t be successful. The Japanese are intelligent and hard working people. I&#x27;m saying that even at your best, a Japanese AI startup will consist of a less talented, less dynamic, monoculture.

Recently, it installed software to delete records of Internet use. ...<p>> Sarah Meisels, Wheaton&#x27;s library director, noted that Wheaton for years has purged circulation records as soon as they are no longer needed, making it practically impossible to comply with the Patriot Act.<p>> In part because the Patriot Act is so rarely invoked, and also because libraries historically have gone to lengths to preserve patrons&#x27; privacy, allowing for the act is almost a moot point, Meisels said.<p>You say you&#x27;ve &quot;never heard librarians question whether they should be retaining borrower records.&quot; How much have you listened to libraries talk about their retention policies to know if they have been saying anything?<p>Bear in mind also that in the US something like 48 of the states have special privacy laws for library records.",1449202352

10674540,comment,10674297,10674437,0,0,hsitz,,,"Most charitable gifts are a form of tax avoidance (and _all_ of them potentially are if a person&#x27;s income is such that it makes sense to take advantage of itemized deductions).  People get receipts for charitable contributions precisely so they can deduct those amounts from their taxable income.  Zuckerberg&#x27;s plan is of much larger scale, but the fact is that the tax code is set up to encourage charitable contributions by making them non-taxable. The tax code is set up this way, quite understandably, to encourage individuals to make charitable gifts, by creating an extra &quot;bang-for-your-buck&quot; for people who choose to make them.<p>The linked article seems to suggest that Zuckerberg is trying to take advantage of the system by gaining tax-exempt status while effectively _not_ making charitable gifts, that he is somehow trying to pass everything to the child while taking advantage of tax-exempt status of a charitable organization.  I&#x27;m skeptical both that his intent is to try to do this, and that there is any scheme that could legally accomplish this.<p>On a different, but related, note, if I were a parent with $40Bn (or $30Bn, $20Bn, $10Bn, or even $1Bn) I would certainly avoid any plan where the bulk of my estate was to be left to my child.  Having that much money is a big responsibility, and it&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s likely to add to a person&#x27;s quality of life. Quite the contrary, it&#x27;s likely a hindrance, not something I would want to saddle my child with.  At most, leave them some large amount ($5M, $10M, $20M, $50M?), something basically guaranteed to make them a wealthy person who doesn&#x27;t need to worry about money, but hopefully not enough to require that responsible management of their fortune be a main focus of their life. (I realize there are moral implications of having that much money for anyone who has even $10M -- perhaps even $1M -- but when the amounts get astronomical, say to hundreds of millions or more, the moral responsibility really does -- or should -- become almost overwhelming.  Not a burden I&#x27;d want to put on my child.)",1449201856

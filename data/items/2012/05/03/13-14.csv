3923841,comment,3923106,3923798,9,0,bmelton,,,"You aren't actually paid based on cost of living, per se, but as that factors in so heavily, it can swing the value proportionally.<p>If I move back to Memphis, TN, I can make approximately half of what I make now in the DC area to live as comfortably as I do.  Does that mean I'm worth half as much?  No.  Does it mean I should expect to make half as much?  Pretty much, yeah.<p>Beyond meeting my basic needs (rent, food, whatever) then it's just a matter of how much expendable income does that salary leave me.  I don't know if 'percentage of salary' is the best way to measure it, but it factors in.<p>Paying me 'market rate' in a place where a 3 bedroom 3 bath house can be had for $150k is a vastly different proposal when that same house is $450k in a different place.  That is the 'cost-of-living' difference.  Sure, I might add the same x amount of dollars of value to the company in both locations, but if I can't live comfortably in my market, then it doesn't matter.<p>Note, this argument ignores the competitiveness of the markets as well.  There are naturally more potential developers in silicon valley than there are in Bumfuck,  Nowhere. Supply and demand does factor here.<p>Lastly, except in situations of outsourcing, you're generally not paid based on where YOU are, but based on where the company (or the location you report to) is.  If you're working remotely from Timbuktu while reporting to an office in Silicon Valley, you should expect SV (or near-to) rates.  If you're telecommuting to the midwest, you should expect midwest pay.<p>The big difference there is in what it costs to replace you.  If you're Linus Torvalds, that cost probably goes way up.  If you're like most of us, that cost is probably a close approximation to 'whatever they can hire a local developer for', assuming there are local developers in the area with the skills you possess.",1336053312

At first the European ones were complaining about their lower salaries, but once they started having kids and needing more medical care, they realized that they were actually much better off than their American counterparts.\nThe lesson here is: you might even make much less, but in Europe there are much much better public schools which are free, hospitals are (mostly) free and in general Universities are either free or  at least one order of magnitude less expensive than in the US. Should I go on? Most contracts in the US do not have unlimited sick leave, whereas in Europe we get that and 20 days of holiday; the US are one of the four countries in the world with no national law on maternity leave (who are the other three is left as an exercise to the reader).\nBut I agree with the general point that salaries of developers should not be so low compared to managerial positions.",1336053239

You should get paid on value added.<p>TBH, I don't see why living in the midwest should drop the salary a company owes you that much. If you are a good developer, you should command a salary comparable to the value you add plus a profit margin for the business.<p>The only two explanations I can see is that, collectively, software engineers in the midwest are simply not negotiating for the salaries they deserve because given the cost of living they don't feel like they have to negotiate for better or that they are on average of much lower quality in the midwest that there is no room in the salary range there for being an outlier commanding a salary outside that range (i.e. no room for a unicorn in a stable full of horses).<p>If I worked remotely from Timbuktu, I would laugh at any employer that offered me less based on the cost of living in Timbuktu.

One of my main goals is to have people submitting their own events/places or submitting those they know of near them; I can't index everything by myself, unfortunately! I'm working on an admin panel which will allow me to moderate submissions to help keep it clean and helpful.<p>In theory a lot of the places (and events too if they have past versions of the same event) will show photos from Flickr. It matches on the Flickr place ID and pulls in photos mentioning the name in that area. However it does mean that a number of places have no photos, which I'd love to improve upon. Allowing people to add their own photos might be a good improvement.<p>I'm trying to think of a way of including things like walks; data that is neither a place nor an event, but something to do at a place/in an area.

I read some articles and found some nice links, for example http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2556/whats-the-best-online-payment-processing-solution.

But we obviously like to implement an online payment process, so that customers can pay for our product on our website.\nOur product is kinda high volume, low value, so we dont expect payments above 1.000 Euros per transaction.

IIRC, this doesn't always work, because many servers reject messages unless they can reverse resolve the ip to the sender's domain.<p>A server for receiving messages is basic infrastructure. The reason for using a simple solution with clear source code, instead of established daemons, like postfix, is that you can tune it to implement filters or notifications.<p>As an example: some time ago I had the idea of putting a bayesian spam filter directly in the server code, eliminating the problem of false positives: the mail is either accepted or rejected, in which case the sender gets to know that the message has not arrived its recipient, instead of silently trashing it as spam.",1336051437

From looking at the list of Nobel prize winners, I can't.<p>Interestingly, in a course on statistical physics, the prof showed that by performing the correct transformations on the central equation of the Black-Scholes model, you can actually reduce it to a plain diffusion equation. He wondered whether it was reasonable to hand out a Nobel prize for that.",1264329752

1073186,comment,1072923,1072923,0,0,coffeemug,,,"I did this. I had a 2.6 undergraduate GPA. At the time my policy was to go to a class three times - for the first lecture, for the midterm, and for the final. The rest of the time I spent working on my own projects. I then went on to get a job for a couple of years, and by the time I decided to apply to grad school I was left with a 2.6 GPA and not a single professor who knew me enough to write a recommendation.<p>So I took three of the hardest graduate CS classes I could find as a ""non-matriculated student"" (basically no degree, you just pay as you go for ""professional"" education), got a 4.0 that semester, and got each one of the three professors to write me a recommendation. Next semester, I was in grad school.<p>I maintained 4.0 for one more semester, until it slipped to 3.9. I always proudly tell this story every time someone talks about undergraduate GPA as a predictor of anything. (Actually, I would much rather hire people with a low undergrad GPA that shot up in grad school, than a high GPA all around).",1264328869

I remember when I was getting ready to launch a revamped version of a service I was working on, the night before launch, when I was migrating all the users from the old version to the new, I accidentally left emails turned on, and fired off about 9,000 welcome emails (which were only supposed to go out to new members) before realizing what was going on. The next day was not so happy. Even with a follow-up email explaining the error, a few users decided to leave the service because of that (harmless) mistake.",1356152379

It had to do with the literalism of the ""next action.""<p>Most of what I experience as a problem in my work relates to getting overwhelmed by the scope of ongoing projects. I'm a music producer, a lot of the projects I do go over a period of weeks or months.<p>I could never figure out the level of granularity for the next action. A common unit of my work is a song. Producing a song has many such levels. The highest/largest would be ""produce song X. From there there are obvious chunks: pre-production, recording, mixing. Recording could be broken down to basic tracks and overdubs. Overdubs to vocals, horns, percussion. And so on.<p>So on a given day, I might have planned to mix a song (could take a day). Is my next action ""mix the song"" or is it ""boot the computer."" The task is a whole series of steps that all must be completed.<p>After a while I started to think that my problem wasn't getting started, it was getting finished! Mixing music is a difficult task that requires a lot of concentration, and I am usually very resource constrained.<p>Since I have a lot of projects that I am working on, more than I can do, I'm already heavily prioritizing my time. After a while it just seemed like more trouble than it was worth to write out all of these next action, as they were usually obvious.<p>What I experience as my problem is not having enough time to get a project done. I'm working efficiently, but as I come up against the resource constraint, which I always do, my subjective experience of stress goes up, and I start getting tired, the stress adding to my stress so to speak. This is when I'm in the thick of it working as hard as I can.<p>I'm sure I am missing something with GTD, but I gave up on it pretty quickly.

The website is www.realityblock.com and we actually have not shown this to anyone just yet.<p>We both are huge reality TV fans, but we noticed there truly wasn't one major community or site that drives social discussion and news content for reality shows.  We figured we could try and create one and give a unique experience.  After looking at Wordpress and test-driving Drupal for a while, we decided to start from scratch and build our own custom system.  The idea was to apply it to a niche subject that caters to both of our interests for a testing ground.  The whole idea behind it was to try and create something new and original, learn a full technology stack, and just get to work and create it.<p>The major thing that sets apart our site from any other random social-news site is probably our live-commenting system.  It's engineered to be single-threaded in order to handle incoming new comments properly.  This allows a reader to not have to refresh the page in order to get the latest comments.  The other goal of this also is to have seamless episode discussions as its being aired on TV.  Also, at the moment we prefer to not have any ads.<p>There are a lot of features that are left to be developed down the road, but we wanted to get the basics complete.  I'm not a professional web developer or freelancer, so this is truly my first website.  If you have any questions about the technology stack or anything at all, let me know.

Innovation is thus low and all things move slowly. Online payment portals typically require the entry of card details, a web redirect to the issuer bank in question, and the entry of further authentication credentials.  With credit card penetration shockingly low, this is still the norm.  People frequently still line up at a bank to send money to other provinces.  With Google Play purchases blocked in China, mobile payments for non iDevice users (Apple devices are considered the de-facto luxury standard; contrast Indonesia where this is still BlackBerry) are still 'out there'. Interestingly but somewhat tangentially, the YingLian network is expanding quickly, notably with Chinese banks opening worldwide and particularly in Southeast Asia, where it is often accessible via local banks' ATMs along with Visa and Mastercard networks (the typical western global ATM network, Cirrus/Maestro, is AFAIK owned by Mastercard, which itself is owned by Bank of America). This helps to provide backing for the Chinese Yuan Renminbi (CNY) as a regional reserve currency, serving a geopolitical interest.<p>US-wise: I integrated in-App payments for the flagship preloaded app on behalf of a major Android device vendor who you can probably guess with AT&T and T-Mobile. One of those carriers was completely unable to block consumers calling up and retroactively renegging on payments via their customer service center; ie. fraud issues. Both of them seemed to outsource their internal billing systems to AMDOCS (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdocs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdocs</a>) who at least partly hosted those systems offsite(!), and are an Israeli, widely thought to be Mossad-backed and intelligence-gathering oriented company.  This is something of an open secret in the international mobile carrier space. Smart cookies, those Israelis!<p>International: Outside of credit and debit card networks, which are basically US owned and operated with the exception of China's emerging YingLian network, SWIFT is the major international payment facilitator. Check this out: <a href=""http://www.asktheeu.org/en/request/intra_european_financial_seizure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asktheeu.org/en/request/intra_european_financial_...</a> .. plus linked FOI requests. All SWIFT transactions have been fed to the US unfiltered since 'at least' 2001 (source: European Data Protection Supervisor), and probably since the founding of their first 'international operations center' in Virginia (~CIA HQ), in 1979. Indeed, to the casual observer, SWIFT appears to be a successful combination American Express/CIA project from that era.",1356149945

Like I mentioned with the Adobe brackets example, based on the nature of the project, a download might be a first choice to test the waters. SF is largely Java/C++/etc., centric (as opposed to RoR or javascript projects) so the installer is the first place to go, to test the tool in the first place.

The defense I gave was about price discrimination. It doesn&#x27;t matter what label you apply to the definition - if you want to argue against me then say why price discrimination is bad. Or say I&#x27;m wrong about price discrimination.<p>Second, the &quot;spirit of the regulation&quot; about front running is about allowing people to trust their agents. Other regulations in the same spirit are lawyer-client confidentiality and &quot;financial advisers can&#x27;t take gifts from companies they give advice on&quot; regulations.<p>There are no &quot;you can&#x27;t kick people&#x27;s ass in the stock market&quot; regulations, in letter or spirit.

What about the following letters since you say you can read Arabic: (و، ا، ي) Aren&#x27;t they vowels? Did you take a look at the Kufic manuscript I linked in my previous post? Those letters exist there as well. Hebrew and Aramaic both have corresponding letters to those too.<p>> Obviously the arabs living in the 8th century still used vowels, just not in writing...<p>The Kufic script image I linked to proves otherwise.<p>I take it I got the point across with the root of the word Qur&#x27;aan (Qa-Ra-&#x27;a) :-)<p>> It&#x27;s &quot;unique&quot;, is that perhaps a polite way of saying that it&#x27;s very different from anything else you&#x27;ve ever read, with &quot;weird&quot; verb forms, words with wrong roots and the like ?<p>Speculation on your part (when you say &quot;perhaps&quot;).

Governments (at least the democratic kind) have always been about representing the ideals of the majority of the population. This has often come in the form of elected officers representing constituencies with their platform of beliefs. It&#x27;s my understanding that this infrastructure was set up this way because it was an individual&#x27;s best way of having their voice heard at the time. We&#x27;ve obviously come a long way since the invention of democracy... And we&#x27;ve seen how technology (especially the internet) can empower individuals.<p>So what this has been leading up to is: does it not make more sense to put power back into the hands of the people, and allow everyone to vote on specific topics rather than focusing on what party to vote for?<p>Edit: I suppose this is more of a question of elections - but perhaps we could dive a little deeper and imagine that there are government works who act solely on the outcome of regular votes.",1397008858

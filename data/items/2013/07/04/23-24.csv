As they say, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and this theory is making several extraordinary claims:<p>1) A hybridization event indeed occurred in the relatively recent genetic history of homo sapiens (rather than the unusual anatomic features being produced some other way).<p>2) The hybridization was with a close relative of pigs (rather than another family that has some similar characteristics, or multiple hybridizations that together gave us the unusual characteristics).<p>3) The hybridization marks the point at which hominids split from the other primates (rather than occurring later in one branch of the hominid family tree).<p>4) That the genes introduced by hybridization gives hominids their unique characteristics (rather than being inconsequential).<p>In return, the theory presents evidence (anatomic oddities and low fertility) that I would characterize as &quot;interesting&quot; and  perhaps &quot;worthy of further study&quot;, but certainly not extraordinary. For this to be plausible, there needs to be a second avenue of evidence, one not based on anatomic similarities...<p>That second avenue could be genetic, but they specifically dismiss it, presupposing a mechanism, backcrossing, that leaves little genetic evidence that it occurred.

Direct response advertising shows in A/B tests that long copy always sells more than short copy.<p>Effectively, this is because an advertisement&#x27;s chance for success increases as the number of pertinent merchandise facts included in the advertisement increases. You reel them in with the headline and the picture, and then the body copy sells the product. Long copy assumes that you&#x27;ve got a half-sold prospect, with little to no time however, so you pack in your promise in there.<p>The caveat is that if you want your long copy to be read, you must write it well. You won&#x27;t hold many readers with those mushy statements of the obvious and vague promises. (This is it...You step back and think...)

In fact, I do believe that it is in fact value-destroyingly cynical for technical people working in the valley;  the current upswing in the business cycle (at least here in silicon valley)  much like the first dot-com, is largely predicated on the idea that we are building the new advertising industry, and the technologies we are building for that new advertising industry make us dramatically more effective than the old advertising industry. so yeah, if you work in the area, you have a personal interest in others believing that targeted ads deliver a lot of value to the advertiser without subtracting too much value from the consumer.  (I personally feel that the &#x27;ads add value for the consumer&#x27; viewpoint that many googlers seem to espouse is so transparently self-serving as to be silly and ignorable[1].)<p>>That&#x27;s like saying teaching in school is useless, because if I need to know something, I&#x27;ll ask someone.<p>The difference here is the difference between asking for advice from a disinterested third party, and asking for advice from someone who gets money if you choose one choice over another - a salesman.<p>It&#x27;s the fundamental problem with using ads to pay for search;   The user of the search wants to find the most relevant answer;   the provider of the search wants the user to find the most relevant answer that the provider is getting paid for.    This is a fundamental conflict of interest.<p>I&#x27;d compare this with going to a VAR[2] for technical advice.   The VAR may be run by someone technically way more competent than you are, but the VAR is paid by the people who sell you stuff.   I mean, maybe the SAN that pays the best commission is also the best SAN for your needs... but maybe not, and if not, then that VAR has a conflict between choosing the highest commission for themselves and choosing the best solution for you (which would increase their reputation, and perhaps lead to larger, more profitable sales down the line.)<p>I mean, I&#x27;m not saying the VAR is always going to choose the short-term money over the long-term reputation... but there is a conflict, and most people seem to think that one should usually rely primarily on sources other than the salesperson for information about a big purchase.<p>[1]absurd claims (in your favor) weaken your position by showing disrespect for the intellect of your counterparty.<p>[2]In the corporate IT world, there&#x27;s a &#x27;general salesperson/technical help picking the right product to buy&#x27; role, called the VAR... the Value Added Re-seller.   The difference between a VAR and a salesman is that a regular salesman works for one company;  he can only sell, say, netapp products.   The advantage of the VAR is that s/he can sell netapp, emc, and nexentia products, and get a commission for each.  The idea is that the VAR will be more likely to steer you to an appropriate product for your needs than a salesman from one manufacturer.     But it&#x27;s still a salesman/woman.<p>(note, the other VAR role is just plain re-seller...  manufacturers offer products to VARs at a discount, so some VARs will just sell you the product at below-list price, without &quot;adding value&quot;)",1372980164

What I disagree with is this:<p><i>It&#x27;s to create uninformed consumers making irrational choices.</i><p>That&#x27;s true when advertisers lie to consumers, which is often the case. But there&#x27;s lots of advertising that just consists of &#x27;Our product has features XYZ, and does (whatever it is) really well. We think you&#x27;ll love it, so please go to the store and buy it right now.&#x27;<p>Chomsky&#x27;s not saying &#x27;oh, you better take adverts with a big pinch of salt because advertisers often exaggerate or try to appeal to emotions like fear, lust and greed.&#x27; If he said that I&#x27;d agree with him, that&#x27;s absolutely true and it&#x27;s something I find offensive about a lot of adverts. But he&#x27;s making a wild claim that all advertising functions that way, disregarding perfectly valid uses of advertising that <i>are</i> informative to the consumer.<p>I dunno, maybe Noam Chomsky thinks manufacturers (or whoever) should just submit their products to some institutional equivalent of <i>Consumer Reports</i> without comment, and then everyone could decide what to buy based on the findings of independent assessors. But as I tried to show above with my example of musicians, consumers&#x27; tastes are subjective to a large degree, and this is especially true for products that are not fungible.<p>So where it&#x27;s true, I&#x27;m happy to agree with him. Take bottled water, for example - 99% of advertising claims made there are total bullshit, and you&#x27;d be better off buying a good shatterproof bottle and filling it from your tap or a filter jug than buying a bottle of water in a store. Some water, like Dasani, isn&#x27;t even sold as spring water, it&#x27;s just the water supplied to the same bottling plant where they make Coca-cola. They&#x27;re selling it on the basis of having a nice-looking bottle and whatever pleasant bit of music they put into commercials showing attractive people having fun, in hopes that consumers will identify with that and pick Dasani next time they&#x27;re thirsty for some water.<p>But that&#x27;s not the entirety of advertising by a long shot. I work in the film industry, so I look at a lot of ads for things like cameras, pro audio gear and so on. Those communications have a lot of value for me, and while I may discount that value based on the style of the communication (are you showing me a camera, or trying to make me feel like this camera will turn me into a successful photographer?), it&#x27;s not making me less informed. Nor is the monthly advertisement I get from the local supermarket chain telling me what new products they have on the shelves and why I might wish to buy them - they&#x27;re on sale, or in season, or now available frozen or whatever. Chomsky treats all advertising as mendacious, ignoring the entirely legitimate purpose of merchants announcing the goods they have to sell.<p>BTW I don&#x27;t work in adverts or marketing or anything related to that. I just have strong opinions about this topic because I was thinking through these issues for myself long before I ever heard of Noam Chomsky, and when I did come to read him I was disappointed at how frequently he set off my bullshit detectors.",1372980133

These signatures are used for fraud detection and marketing. The programs process roughly nine gigabytes of stream data daily.

They are simply addressable computers that return html data.

The internet is a content game played over http and you or somebody else pays for the content. The rest is just wiring. If you&#x27;re not paying for the content, you&#x27;re getting milked of every possible other piece of information you provide to the rent-takers.<p>Standardization is awesome, but the more we try to centralize and standardize all of the internet, the more really powerful interests are going to take advantage of us.

There&#x27;s still gunk in my eyes from sleeping.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about how I we all get health care. \nA year ago, I nearly vanished from my doctor&#x27;s private practice because I had an intuitive feeling that expensive, highly specialized care without a single payer insurance system was a backdoor to endless health care debt nation wide. Now, as the dust settles from our collective experiences, I know this to be true.<p>So I&#x27;m revisiting some of my older habits. I&#x27;m using WebMD to diagnose my own problems. I&#x27;ve enrolled in an EMT course to learn basic triage and treatment. I&#x27;ve installed an app that automatically notifies me of any possible drug interactions between the various medications I buy off the black market for myself. Last week I thought I might have sepsis, but I dropped into an off-the-books IRC chatroom and found out I didn&#x27;t; it was just a bruise that looked funny. If you want to send me Bitcoins, I&#x27;ll take them.<p>I continue to try to find ways to diagnose myself over the web. I learn new tools every day. And every tool I have, that&#x27;s another step towards freedom from the corporate controlled health care system.  I&#x27;m convinced that if other people don&#x27;t teach themselves how to be their own doctors, then they&#x27;re just pawns with their own lives and careers who obviously have too little spare time on their hands.  Distributed peer to peer medicine is a must.  Evolve beyond the reach of the insurance companies that want to bankrupt you.  I&#x27;m doing just that.<p>Distributed everything is where we&#x27;re going.<p>The way I see it, if you&#x27;re still on centralized health care networks, you&#x27;re part of the problem.

All of your information is being recorded, forever, and it&#x27;s all going to end up on an itemized bill that you can&#x27;t pay because your insurance is inadequate and our country doesn&#x27;t value primary care.<p>I&#x27;m running more and more under the pseudonym of Ven Portman. I don&#x27;t really know why, since I just published that fact on my own public website.  I believe that everyone should learn to be a specialist in their spare time in order to temporarily evade the abuses of corporations and governments.  I somehow believe that normal people have time to learn these things and blame them if they don&#x27;t.  I avoid grappling with a broad conversation about corporate and government corruption and abuse in the field in which I dabble because clinging to my dilettante skill set is the only way I can retain some illusion of agency in a world which is increasingly unjust and beyond my control.  Anyone who doesn&#x27;t do what I do and devote all of their spare time to learning basic medicine to help build our distributed health care system of the future is just part of the problem.<p>The centralized health care system you know is dying. We&#x27;re scattering to back alley healthcare everywhere. If you&#x27;re a normal person with a family and their own field of expertise who doesn&#x27;t have time to take an EMT course and learn how to intubate an unconscious blunt force trauma victim, well then fuck you.

It&#x27;s just a blunt and stupid statement.<p>The author of this clearly has no cryptographic expertise and just wrongly applied a cryptographic scheme.<p>In the description, it reads &quot;[..] messages are encrypted and decrypted at the end points such that malicious machines on the network cannot eavesdrop on the conversation, including the chat server,&quot; but no effort is made in the client code (client.py) to ensure the server works as it should. Yes, the server can&#x27;t eavesdrop on the data as-is, but that means you have to trust the hosting provider is using exactly your server.go, thus you have to trust the server completely after all. And if you do, why bother trying to hide it from the server in the first place?<p>I&#x27;d feel even less safe using this than IRC over SSL.<p>The major problem with this is that you&#x27;re trying to do something impossible. In order to have a secure connection between two or more people, you need to either have a key in place or establish one. Both of these options are extremely hard to achieve.<p>In the former, you have a to get a key in place (which can&#x27;t get transferred through the server for obvious reasons), so that has to be established before any confidential data is being transferred. This is clearly not happening.<p>The latter option is a key exchange protocol such as DiffieHellman. This can work; you can in fact make a key exchange between two parties where an eaves-dropper will be none the wiser for listening in. But then you have another problem: authenticity. You have no guarantee that you are in fact talking to who you think you are.<p>Your system makes no effort to overcome either of these challenges.</i>",1372978933

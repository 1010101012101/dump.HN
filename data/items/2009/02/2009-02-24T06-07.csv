Its not necessarily the best way to do things (like say ensuring the given user HAS permission to access the photo before serving it.)<p>O well I guess if the problem is too big for facebook, it must be too big for the rest of us.

492752,comment,491936,492722,0,0,sho,,,"Exactly right. The employer who rejected anyone who moved around a lot (usually 12 to 18 months, with a maximum stay anywhere of around 2 years) would exclude pretty much all the best people I know.<p>I suppose it depends what you're looking for. A lawyer firm or family medical practise might be looking for long term stability for the sake of their patients/clients. But for programming, and I assume that most of us on ""hacker news"" are programmers, you want passion, initiative and the ability to actually get things done.<p>It's a completely natural cycle to arrive somewhere new with a new project, full of passion, and to put a lot of work into it. After a while, around 18 months for me, you're sick of it and ready to move on. There is no point, either for you or the company, at pretending otherwise and sticking around just to clock up the hours. And what you really don't want is the ""lifer"" mentality.<p>The role of ""permanent full time worker"" is retrograde and disappearing fast. Perhaps it's better to cast out the concept entirely and start thinking purely in terms of contracts. I suspect that a large number of the best programmers already think like this and companies that can't adapt to that will simply miss out.",1235458132

That way even if the ""angel"" is less than angelic, he can't cause too much damage.<p>Deals fall through; that's a fact of life.  Deals with inexperienced angels fall through in particularly screwy ways.  Shortly after I started working on tarsnap, I talked to a wannabe angel; it sounded like we had hammered out the framework for a deal, but ""I'll get this put into writing and send it over for you to review in a few days"" stretched into two months, and the draft he sent over was unlike what we had discussed on nearly every important point -- and then when I objected he accused me of backing out of a deal and threatened to sue me for the cost of drafting it (he never went so far as to tell me how much those fees were, though, so I guess he came to his senses).<p>Seriously -- unless you're dealing with an angel who has a track record, trust them as much as you'd trust a second hand car dealer.",1235457562

492739,comment,491196,492186,0,0,helveticaman,,,"I totally agree; arrogance is very important if you're an unrecognized badass.  Caesar was kidnapped by pirates and held for ransom.  He told them he was worth more than that ransom, so they obliged by raising it.  Once he was free he pursued and executed the pirates.<p>Most people should not have that arrogance because most people are not Caesar.  Thing is, if you are Caesar, you sometimes have to be arrogant to mediocre people (especially bureaucrats) because they will crush you if you're not.  But it's hard to draw the line because it's so few people are true geniuses and it's hard to know for sure if you are one.<p>Being a genius (as far as I can tell, because I don't know if I am one) seems to be tough in this world.  It's not like being a star athlete, because in that case the best know they're the best, say so, and bet their future on it.  That is not the case with geniuses.  You can't take out huge loans against your future wealth in order to buy status and get laid in high school, for instance.  I'm sure there are Silicon Valley billionaires who wish they could get back a part of their nerdy lost youth, but it's impossible.  On the other hand, it's much less likely for a genius to have the balls to bet on his brains, challenge the curriculum, and get people excited about his future the way athletes do.  I guess it's because, at the end of the day, society doesn't like nerds as much as it likes athletes, and because people like to think they're better than others.  In this case, it's old people who think they are better than young people, rationalizing that they are smarter.",1235456977

492734,comment,492253,492687,0,0,patio11,,,"<i>the right way to do URL parameters is probably to make them RESTful and add a route.</i><p>I respectfully disagree.  REST just means interpreting an HTTP verb as a logical action, it doesn't mean we wage holy war against the heretical question marks.  Query parameters remain useful for, e.g., allowing one route to take a number of optional parameters:<p>/sales/report?year=2008<p>/sales/report?year=2008&vendor_id=1<p>/sales/report?year=2008&vendor_id=1&expense_category_id=12<p>Now if all three of those parameters are optional, that is eight unique RESTful routes you'd have to write (map.sales_report_for_vendor_and_expense_category '/sales/report/vendor/:vendor_id/expense_category/:expense_category_id/'...  times eight), which doesn't sound DRY to me at all.",1235456596

But then the initial deploy for those projects, on average, took about 20 minutes of one person's time.<p>Iterative development often goes hand-in-hand with iterative deployment.  Somewhere during week 3, we'd spend an hour moving onto an automated build and deploy system, and from there on out it would be push-button.<p>Once, and only once, the site got big enough to need its own dedicated box at a colo, so that added an extra couple days building a server, driving it to the facility and moving the site.  But by then we were 3 months into development, so the effort was nowhere near 25% of our total spent man hours.<p>Cool idea for a service though.

492726,comment,492245,492675,0,0,garply,,,"Thanks for responding to this.  It seems I don't have permission to view this note (probably due to a change in networks on my side) and I believe the incident was a few months ago, so I may not have perfect recollection of the note. I hope I didn't mischaracterize your note.<p>I recall the logic of the note being along the lines of: ""You're saying nasty things to me. I see that you're a Christian. How can you do this when being hateful is against your religion?""  It read to me like a snarky response calling him a hypocrite (even if you didn't explicitly label him as such).<p>I have serious problems with this for a few reasons:<p>First, as a business owner, I don't think an employee should be anything less than the pinnacle of politeness when dealing with customers (which is what FB's users amount to - even if they're only paying you with eyeball time).  Implicitly labeling him as a hypocrite was impolite.  The note damaged my opinion of how FB is run as a business.<p>The second, larger, issue is related to privacy.  Personally, I'm not comfortable with you treating my profile information as anything more than raw data - as neutral and uninteresting as a set of ones and zeros. Just as I wouldn't want my doctor to tell people things he knew about me, I don't think you should reveal information about this guy - either his religion or the impolite way in which he communicated with you. I seem to recall that information from his profile not being available to the general public.<p>Finally, when it comes down to it, his religion just had nothing to do with whatever feature request / bug report he was making.  Just as I wouldn't expect a waitress to call attention to me having orange hair when I order a burger, I don't expect you to bring up my personal information when I give you feedback on your service.<p>Shortly thereafter, I quit using FB on a regular basis. I did so for several reasons, but that incident was certainly somewhere in my mind when I quit.",1235455737

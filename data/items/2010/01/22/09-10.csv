One of the things behind Facebook's success is that they didn't, instead they used real names.<p>Before, whenever a new interesting virtual community appeared, I used to find my existing ""net-hooked"" friends in there, because I knew which usernames they usually use, or I already discussed it with them over some other channel, resulting in me only meeting the usual suspects.<p>When Facebook came, I started finding people that I had never seen online before, it allowed me to get a connection to them because they used their real names. We were all used to nicknames, but it turned out to be a strength, not a weakness, to use real names instead. I don't see why this would be different in Japan.",1264154374

I read the first few pages... it gets fairly technical.  I don't think most of my non-programming friends know what a thread is.  If they have some vague idea, they certainly don't know the difference between a thread and a process is.",1264154002
1069404,comment,1068709,1068709,0,0,lionhearted,,,"This kind of thinking terrifies me:<p>> Not content to limit speech, the program also informed resident assistants that “all whites are racists” and that it was the university’s job to heal them<p>But it doesn't terrify me for the reason it would terrify most people. Me, I'm pretty international, from what I know of genetics I'd actually prefer to have mixed blood and bi-cultural children.<p>So why am I terrified? Because this kind of nonsense is really the only way that a vicious white nationalism could make a comeback. It's been thoroughly beaten down, but you could generate a hell of a backlash if you kept up with this kind of ""all whites are racist"" (direct quote!) type stuff.<p>Really, I think we need to put all forms of nationalism down. White nationalism, yes, but also various fanatical patriotism, religious nationalism, and other forms of racial nationalism - including amongst minorities. This isn't a popular opinion right now, but I think encouraging people to make their skin color part of their identity is likely to lead to adversarial relations.<p>I understand the historical reasons and practical considerations on why it can be beneficial. But at some point you've got to take the high road and stop playing that card, lest you risk resurrecting white nationalism, which certainly wouldn't be a good thing.<p>At the very very least, cut out the ""white people are the enemy"" thing - the vast majority of educated whites in Western democracies are very open minded, accommodating, and even go a little out of their way to look out for people from tougher backgrounds. The only thing that could be done to screw that up is repeatedly ostracize them... which is exactly the strategy some people are taking. Seems like a very bad idea to me, on pretty much all levels.",1264153991

European nations have a stronger ethnic identity which is less able or willing to accept new groups.<p>Really though you can't compare America to Europe in a single generalization - Poland, UK and Spain, to name a few, are completely different places, more so than, say, California and West Virginia. It will be impossible (and undesirable) to achieve the same kind of unity America has, not in this century anyway.",1264153638

1069395,comment,1069377,1069377,0,0,buro9,,,"Seems like it would be more accurate if it were based on their profile page and the ""created X days ago"" bit.<p>Once you've grouped by day you could then look at participation to provide a little more granularity over the course of the day (put everyone at 23:59 on the day and if a bit of participation can proven to have been earlier in the day move the person to that time).<p>Then the chronological result is your list and a better indicator of the potential userid.<p>Not that I think this is accurate, I run a community that does use userids and when you account for the accounts deleted because they were spammers you end up with a sparser set of users. Someone isn't the nth person on the site, they're just the nth id allocated by an autoincrement counter.<p>The utility is a little pointless though. Whilst a userid is one of a number of useful metrics of social status (ah, an early member! or ah, a n00b!) on their own they are pretty useless.<p>You do need to put these metrics in context, they're useful when you're on slashdot because they're visible as part of the comment stream so you can factor them in to your reading of the comments  and easily compare the various indicators of authors visually.<p>If the function to get the metrics is elsewhere and not easily comparable, the usefulness as one of a collection of metrics is far lower than if it were visible.*<p>All that said, I prefer the equality of usernames. I like the precept that ""time registered"" isn't a major factor and that your words and thoughts are worth more than just having signed up early.<p>* Perhaps you want to make a greasemonkey script?* *<p>* * You could do one for tagging too so that tagging over there is transparently part of the site here.",1264153311

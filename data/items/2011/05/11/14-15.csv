She has two or three girls set up on a rotation that come over and watch the kids for a number of hours most days of the week so she can get some work done. It would be impossible to do anything otherwise, especially as the kids don't often nap at the same time.<p>They live fairly close to a local college, so it's worked out well for them to find people for the position. One even stays in a secondary building they have on property with a portion of the rent traded for the babysitting.",1305125996

I got by on too little sleep for too long, taking care my son during the day and working during naps and evenings, often late into the night. It wasn't easy, but we had a great time.<p>Now for the bad news. While this was all possible working on my own product, on my own schedule, there is just no way that I could have kept any external commitments. Some weeks I got a lot done, and some weeks I didn't get anything done. If you're going to try this, I would suggest scaling daycare back to half days, or maybe just a few days a week at first to see how well you can make it work out.",1305125989

2536645,comment,2536309,2536384,18,0,Jun8,,,"Good point, since I think that some concepts from linguistics can be carried over to computer languages and vice versa. The central dogma of Chomskyism ( which is ~ linguistics, at least in the US) was (roughly) that all languages are equivalent, hence linguistic relativism was BS. This approach has been shattered recently by quite a few people, I think one of the most well known is Lera Boroditsky (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lera_Boroditsky"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lera_Boroditsky</a>). Luckily, CS people (and the like) never had their minds warped by this paradigm so have always been free to discuss ""which language to expand the (programming) mind"".<p>My rant done, let me produce my list:<p>* Ancient Greek (or Latin) - inflectional: Just sheer coolness of it and the literature you can read in the original is enough. But these languages are the grand daddies of Indo-European (unless you wanna go Hittite or Lithuanian) grammar and will teach you valuable linguistic and conceptual points (i.e. cases, noun declension). Learning this is like learning ALGOL, kind of useless but you'll see where a lot of concepts have originated from.<p>* Mandarin (i.e. Chinese) - isolating: Two points: Seeing the syntaxlessness of these languages is mind boggling and expanding experience. Many poet/translators have remarked about the ""timelessness"" of Chinese poetry, because verbs don't have tense markings. And, of course, the writing system is very interesting, too. Like learning Lisp (Scheme), an interesting, expanding experience.<p>* Turkish - agglutinative: (Disclaimer, I'm a native speaker) A great into to the agglutinative aspect of languages (unless you want to learn an American-Indian language) and an interesting phonetic system, so regular, is used as an example a lot in phonology courses.<p>* Swahili: The concept of noun classes (a generalization of grammatical gender) is bewildering when you first encounter it, swahili has 16 of them (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_language#Noun_classes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_language#Noun_classes</a>)<p>And more esoteric ones that would be great to learn: My favorites would be Basque (interesting language isolate) and Georgian.",1305125647

I actually did look after our younger boy from time to time during work hours when he was younger, but only during the relatively easy period between when he finished breast feeding and when he was able to start running around.

My experience is that both are really good for the kids for different reasons. Nursery gets them socialising with other children, and having a nanny at home gives extra one-to-one attention that really helps them. The nanny who comes to us does all the creative activities which you aspire to provide as a parent, because she's experienced and has games etc that I wouldn't have thought of, and also because she's not worrying about the practicalities of life at the same time.<p>If you are going to have child care at home, especially if your work ever involves talking to customers on the phone, then you absolutely have to arrange a separate space to be your office away from where children are playing.

In this case it would be worse than owning out right.  As now you're on the hook for the cost of the device you lost at the time you need to pick up another device.  Are they going to allow you to rent the second device?  Details would be nice.<p>Also when at a college your college is usually your ISP.  And at the one I work at as long as you have access to the classroom then you have access to the network.<p>I agree with the backups part but that is independent of this particular arrangement as Google Apps works on non-rented devices too. :)",1305122666

Me not being from the UK is probably a bigger barrier.<p>Still, I don't understand. Instead of your child being in a place where they can socialize with other kids and be watched by adults, you want to let them spend all day playing quietly by themselves or being babysat by the TV while you are working on your computer all day with your back turned? And this is your unrealistic, ideal best-case?!<p>If you don't mean full time, that may work (you can probably squeeze in a couple of hours a day, at the expense of the house growing messier and messier). This is much more reasonable when you aren't paying for daycare.<p>I'd also like to ask if you really think you could handle being alone all day, constantly juggling 2 stressful jobs at once, every day. A full time mom can leave the house with the kid(s) and socialize, but if you are working that would just be something else to stress over while you try to ""squeeze it in"".<p>If you can afford full-time daycare, are you SURE you can't afford to just stay home? (At least you OR your partner)<p>P.S. I actually am not a big fan of daycare, and my wife is likely going to go back to being a full-time mom after half a year of working part time specifically to let both mommy and baby socialize outside of the house (separately, in this case). Gas prices, tuition hikes, and the loss of alternative care have made it too costly (she was working 3 days just to pay for 2 days of daycare. Seriously).<p>(Edited to add a couple of sentences, didn't notice Jem's reply until afterwards)",1305122539

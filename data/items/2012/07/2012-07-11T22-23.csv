You get to live the hyperbole and talk about it too. What better place to do so? For example, the US healthcare doesn't suck, it's actually really good. But it's only good for those who can afford it. I've had to go to the doctor three times now in the UK (eye infection, sports injury and regular checkup) and every time I've had to wait 3+ hours to get diagnosed/treated. In the US, my healthcare meant I was in and out in 30 minutes. The US is a great place when you can afford it. That being said, I happily waited in line for the 3+ hours because I knew that other people are being treated for things they normally can't afford in the US. The problem in America, is that no one can even fathom a system like this. It's so foreign to the way we operate our lives (i.e. our culture) because everything we do is deeply rooted in transferences of goods and services in the form of money.<p>ps- I'm also an American who has lived in the UK, Germany, and been to 30+ countries.

Contrast this to a client dependent on an XML or JSON Schema. Yeah, that client is easy to write, but you've now locked the server into not changing its format or you've doomed the client to break when the server decides to change anyway.

Even in the tech industry itself.<p>2 - The strong dislike for using Facebook login is many-fold. For most people it comes down to abuse of the Facebook link (e.g., spamming things onto your feed, messaging your friends, being in general awful), and that is a trust issue that can be mitigated with the correct positioning and assurances. The people who are against cross-network authentication on principle (as opposed to some negative artifact of its current implementation) are an even smaller camp, and they're the only ones you're really guaranteed to lose out on.<p>> <i>""but when potential users all say ""I'm not going to use this product because it makes me jump through hoop X"" (and X isn't a fundamental component), my response would be to remove X.""</i><p>1 - Beware of what your users say, it is not always what they want, or what they would use. People are extraordinarily bad at guessing their own motivations, if you took all feedback literally at face value, you might be screwed. A complaint against X may be actually a complaint against sub-component Y, or the interaction of X with unrelated bit Z.<p>2 - The benefit here <i>vastly</i> outweighs the objections. The numbers have shown this again, and again, and again, <i>and again</i>, that when given the option to do a one-click signin vs. filling out a form (and giving out your email address, <i>again</i>), people will overwhelmingly choose the former.",1342046947

Looking around it appears that a number of other libraries still use browser sniffing (such as MooTools, Prototype, and Dojo).

4231839,comment,4227849,4231295,6,0,hkmurakami,,,"This is Japan's ""Cool Aid"".<p>The truth is that there are no laws or contracts preventing companies from laying off its workers en masse, yet the individual deludes himself into thinking that there is some concrete social contract exists. The thing is, when the economy was growing at 5% a year, companies <i>could</i> uphold this (ephemeral) social contract by employing people for a lifetime and guaranteeing a great pension.<p>I personally know CEOs of smaller companies in Japan who vowed to not lay off a single person during the tough times of 2008-2010. The C-suite guys took zero salary for at least 2008, and all other employees took a temporary 30% pay cut. However, this is not the norm. While outright firings may be more rare, things go on underneath the surface. Fulltime employment slots replaced with contract workers in factories, significant amounts of employment moving overseas to SE Asia, etc.<p>Layoffs aren't as common as the US, but that's actually not necessarily a good thing. Hiring of new grads has gone down significantly (the last graduating class with decent job prospects was the class of 2008), while the older workers (even those who underperform) are kept on board. Like kalleboo says, Japan is about ""family"". They are kind towards members of their family, and strikingly cold to those who are not. Those who are part of the company are ""family"", and are protected. New grads who cannot find work are not part of the family, and don't receive the same empathy. Even those who can find work, even at the best and brightest companies, are faced with a situation where their lifetime earnings will be significantly lower than those of the boomers. (on the order of $2.5MM vs $3~4MM lifetime)<p>There are no good figures about the employment rate of college graduates, but if you discount students who have gone onto become 'part time / contract' workers, the employment rate may be around 60%. (The problem is that all the stats are wildly skewed - for instance, employment rates that include 'underemployed' new grads, or only counting graduates from mid-tier colleges and above) No one <i>really</i> knows how bad the true youth unemployment situation is in Japan.<p>College students are very risk averse, particularly in the turmoil following the financial crisis. I recall that a poll among college students back in 2011 declared that they wanted to become public workers above all other options (public workers cannot be fired, afaik).<p>Japan's leaders are very talented at keeping a sinking ship afloat. But they can't avoid the inevitable. Like the country's debt problem, there will come a moment when things catastrophically implode.",1342046325

I've worked in several contracts with various agencies, and I know people who still stay in the game, and the <i>best</i> ones I've seen are ten years behind everybody else and spending about 50x what they should to get things done. They're simply swamped in bureaucratic molasses.<p>For instance, even though the ""business"" of the government (things like tax collection or tracking shipping containers) uses much less data than say a Google does, not only do they have a CIO, they have an entire battalion of CIOs. There's a whole club of just government CIOs. Each of those, of course, has a full staff. When contracts are paid, it usually goes through some completely different set of people than the people who actually receive the value.<p>If you're a company trying to help the government, you'd laugh your ass off if it weren't so damned sad. Your programmers -- and you gotta love this -- are all considered little cardboard cutouts, like cookies. If you have a problem to solve, the correct answer isn't what technology you would use to solve it. Usually that's outside your control anyway. The correct answer is how many ""standard"" programmers it would take to get it done. The quality of a ""standard"" programmer varies, but it's usually somebody with a few weeks of training and a desire to be anywhere but here.  Many times your government partners are incompetent and a danger to themselves and others when it comes to technology. They want the moon but they don't want to take any political risk at all. I had one guy just flat out tell me: you guys make all the tough choices and if it goes well I'll take all the credit. If it fails it's all your fault. At least he was honest.<p>I could go on, but I don't want to get into a rant. Ever wonder how the IRS spent billions on upgrades with nothing to show for it? Or how the FBI's new case management system was a total Charlie Foxtrot? Geesh. 33.3 million is getting off <i>lucky</i>.",1342046109

Regular kings, by contrast, could take their time.<p>In the modern world, we don't respect glory in battle or plunder like we used to, and so we use the republican form of government to prevent anyone from amassing too much power on a permanent basis at all.

Managing companies does requires taking business decisions 'you have to make' with other businesses. It is not an option. Saying 'all these benefits are nice to have but are not core to the existing strategy of the the target partner' is misleading. Proper BD is precisely the opposite, your have to take into account the core strategy of the target businesses to make it a success. Saying 'Consequently, BD may be ultimately harder to succeed in since it requires a lot of faith and time' -> BD is not preaching or based on beliefs, it relies on sound financial and strategic analysis. BD serves a very different purpose than sales (long term vs short term revenues) and both are equally important beyond the start-up stage.",1342045292

Yep, I do. But you started this with a remark about how HN'ers would just snark-out his service, to which I replied that there were good reasons to be careful about choosing what you consume that had nothing to do with Mixergy.

Surely you know me better than that :)<p>""...Do you really expect all the useful information to be custom tailored to exactly your requirements?...""<p>No, I do not. The discussion here was about best expenditures for startup help, not about what my expectations are. In fact, my conclusion is that such advice cannot exist, why would I expect it?<p>And there's no blaming of the medium going on, just an acknowledgment of its limitations. It's a great medium for entertainment, and 25 bucks or whatever is a fine price to pay to be entertained. With enough listeners, odds are that somebody somewhere will get that spark they need from each podcast, so it's definitely worth it as an exercise from the publisher's standpoint.

As the discussion progresses, the audience can interject questions (many times using IM or whatnot) and those help pin each position down.<p>What happens here is that during the process of challenging the answers, a broader argument and discussion happens around whatever the problem to be solved is. This increases the ""surface area"" of the piece of advice and help; it is described in various scenarios and under various edge-conditions.

(b) we cannot trust them not to lie to us about what they are doing, one way or another.<p>The other problem is that the NSA has made it clear that in its opinion collecting metadata on a call is fine at any time, for anyone/everyone.<p>Metadata on a cell phone clearly includes time and location of cellphone/receiver checkins.<p>It is absolutely reasonable to assume that, if they want, the NSA can track the location of any person carrying a cellphone; or  - given that they are storing this data - reach into the past and know exactly where you were, and when.<p>that is a remarkable power, IMO.<p>Hook that data up to a computer display and holy cow, that is a powerful tool.<p>Frankly, it would be awesome.  if it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that you, specifically and personally, appear on that display.",1374022492

Certainly not protection of a business model, and not protection of a feature.

A competitor -- and some exist already -- can bodge along without it, but they will inevitably have a PR disaster that my technology effectively prevents.<p>The real purpose of the patent is to increase attractiveness to investors and to encourage potential startup competitors to look at other markets.

Or not, depending on what kind of company I&#x27;m applying to.<p>You&#x27;ll forgive me if I don&#x27;t discuss the subject matter of the patent.

Both cable and phone have their own extent systems and are not competing for physical access to some right of way, or what ever mechanism or reason the multichannel operators have long used to justify this system.<p>I haven&#x27;t closely followed the so-called &quot;national franchise&quot; debate that took place a few years ago, other than that it was defeated.<p>The phone companies are talking about abandoning the POTS system on an accelerated schedule, but at the same time Verizon failed to invest in FIOS expansion, leaving the replacement for POTS low speed, long-distance ADSL service.<p>The cable companies have very belatedly been working on introducing an IP-based system based on a home gateway, similar to what AT&T&#x27;s Uverse system uses.<p>I found it very interesting when the head of Cox Communications commented at a recent talk (in March I think) that he visited the valley 5 years ago, and then proceeds to talk up Palm.<p>I can understand why a local community would embrace and accept this solution to their fiscal problems, but we should debate whether the franchise system is holding us back technologically on regional and national level.",1374022301

It&#x27;s been a slow and expensive process.<p>So far I am about AUD $17k into the process. This has netted me a WIPO PCT filing, which I have now parlayed into an Australian filing and soon a USPTO filing.<p>What nobody tells you at the beginning is that it all takes much longer than you think it will. And costs a lot more, because <i>you have to file in each country independently</i>. If I am granted a US patent, that&#x27;s the lynchpin, the key element that would make a portfolio of patents worth a damn. But then I will still need to stump thousands more dollars <i>per country</i> to file elsewhere.<p>A company like Apple doesn&#x27;t have the problem of fretting over the cashflow implications. They are not carefully shepherding a single filing that cost-wise represents a meaningful fraction of their revenue and assets.<p>Instead, to many companies, patents are a pipeline. A factory. They have on-staff lawyers to pump a constant stream of applications into global offices. They have economies of scale and generous cashflows that I simply don&#x27;t.<p>Because of the economics of the situation, patents favour wealthy incumbents, not upstart inventors.

Basically it&#x27;s impossible to examine for that at the moment because &#x27;games&#x27; etc would rely on a person&#x27;s recall of, say, how much they did the cross-word, that sort of thing whereas education is verifiable <i>and</i>, in this case, statistically meaningful.<p>Regarding onset of dementia.<p>There are early-onset dementias that can start from the late 40&#x27;s to 60s. These are usually of a genetic variant (For example, 2 copies of ApoE4 gene, Amyloid Precursor Protein or a  presenilin mutation, or Down&#x27;s syndrome). Diabetes is a big risk factor as well.<p>There are also a number of dementias that are of early onset that are not Alzheimer&#x27;s such as Frontotemporal dementia and Semantic Dementia which are awful diseases and it&#x27;s terrible to watch patients so young with such severe pathology.<p>><i>Also what if dementia already has some effects early in life, just more subtle.</i><p>Just to focus on the most common dementia, Alzheimer&#x27;s - 
We know that it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> have more subtle effects early on. When you start to develop it, you start to develop it. The following things are the features of Alzheimer&#x27;s, in order of progression:<p>- Memory<p>o Impaired anterograde episodic memory<p>o delayed recall of stories<p>o Sparing of Working memory<p>- Attentional and executive deficits<p>o poor concentration<p>- Language and Knowledge<p>o Impaired semantics<p>- Visuospatial and perceptual disabilities<p>But It definitely is not apparent so early for example in people at 20 or 30 years of age.<p>We know this because brain biopsies from post mortems of young people don&#x27;t show the neuronal loss, amyloid plaques and &#x27;tombsones&#x27; of Tau protein tangles on histology which is pathognomonic of the disease.<p>In fact, Education seems to be so important at preventing the march of the disease <i>not</i> because higher levels of brain activity somehow decrease deposition of the characteristic histology findings, but because increased education increases so-called &#x27;cognitive reserve&#x27;, meaning that even when the damage starts to occur, the person is still able to function at such a high level because the decline in global cognitive capabilities has not yet been so great that the characteristic signs and symptoms have begun to manifest.<p>Could you argue cause vs effect with regard to education and cognitive reserve? Sure, and I haven&#x27;t examined the data closely enough with regard to education to know how or if they controlled for it. However I have read <i>extensively</i> from the original literature with regard to the origins and pathogenesis of the disease and trust that something that is trumpeted at being a major factor in delaying the development of AD, by way of the quality of the reporting literature (Lancet, NEJM, Nature and Nature Medicine) to not have been missed after extensive peer review over the course of several decades (?the argument from authority?

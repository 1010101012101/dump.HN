3098810,comment,3098435,3098658,7,0,darklajid,,,"> This makes as much sense as 'everything' being true. You would write if (true) {...}, but I can't imagine why you would do that.<p>I think his real point is that there's no 'truthy', no evaluation to true. Later in the article he says that<p><pre><code>  if (a) a.foo(); 
</code></pre>
isn't possible because of that. A better example would've been (a != null) instead of (1 == 1), imho.<p>> This seems to directly contradict the first point. Which is it? It should do a dynamic type check and generate a run time exception in both cases. I don't see anything to convince me that ""2"" + 2 will be a concatenation... in the spec.<p>Not in the spec itself, right. But the current documentation seems to imply exactly what he states. See the definition of '+' here: <a href=""http://www.dartlang.org/docs/api/String.html#String::String"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dartlang.org/docs/api/String.html#String::String</a><p>""String +(Object other)

Seriously, Australia is an incredibly expensive place to live now. I'm from Perth and I'd say that overall it's cheaper for me to live in _Manhattan_ than Perth now. MANHATTAN. Actually, same for same rent-wise, Perth is still cheaper but Manhattan has options Perth doesn't (like saving money by living in a walk-up);<p>2. Virtually no VC and startup community; and<p>3. Depending on your industry, you will find very consumer-friendly legislation that is actually a problem for small companies to comply with, particularly in the finance space (and within that space, particularly dispensing anything that could be construed as ""financial advice""). The US has gotten worse about this in the last decade with SOX and other reactionary legislation but it's still better.<p>Put it this way: I don't think something like Mint could ever be done in Australia.<p>Now Australia's fortunes rise and fall with China's so the boom industries are mining and construction. If you can think of something to sell to these industries, you could make a lot of money. But why do it in Australia? The strong Australian dollar makes it more attractive to do it elsewhere.<p>Sure health insurance is an issue but you can buy that in the US and even if it's hundreds of dollars a month (IMHO) you're better off overall.",1318344939

The iPhone 4s was a slight improvement over the iPhone 4, and frankly I'm still shocked to hear things like the RAM is the same and the processor still clocks at barely 800Mhz. For Apple, this is fine. But saying that my iPhone 3gs-holding-friend shouldn't be disappointed <i>just because Apple is selling millions of them</i>, is just silly. He's disappointed because I'm about to have a 1.5Ghz dual core phone with 1GB of memory and a resolution higher than the computer I used in highschool just 4 years ago in a thinner form factor than his phone. He will love his iPhone 4s and I will love my phone, but I don't understand the tone of this article. Is it really so unreasonable to want LTE given the available phones on the market that have LTE?

In contrast, the fact that <i>parts</i> of OS X are open source does not seem to help OS X gain traction in markets where completely open-source software stacks are vastly more popular than OS X, like embedded systems, supercomputing and internet servers.<p>I am not an expert on all of the reasons developers and admins of embedded systems, supercomputers and internet servers prefer completely open-source ecosystems to OS X, but I tend to believe a lot of it has to do with not wanting Apple to be able to jerk them around and has to do with the fact that if they started to use OS X, Apple would be able to jerk them around almost as much as they would be able to if Darwin, Webkit, LLVM and TextEdit were not open source.",1318344504

I think this article is FUD (and I don't really care for Dart).<p>> Dart programs may be statically checked. The static checker will report some violations of the type rules, but such violations do not abort compilation or preclude execution.<p>> In other words the ""static checker"" is a lint-type development aid, not a language feature.<p>My reading is that the language is optionally typed (similar to SBCL). The type checker will warn you when you have a type declaration that appears to be incorrect, and will optimized based on these declarations, but will not keep you from running code that violates a type-check. This is a remarkably good solution for dynamic languages.<p>> Here's a strange thing: the one and only true value is the boolean literal boolean true. Everything else is false. That means that code in if (1) { ... } will never execute, because 1 is a number, not a boolean, and there is no implicit conversion to boolean. You'll need to write if (1==1) instead.<p>This makes as much sense as 'everything' being true. You would write if (true) {...}, but I can't imagine why you would do that.<p>> There is no implicit type conversion between numeric, string or boolean types.<p>Ok. This is a good thing. Auto conversion is bad.<p>> The distinction between string and numbers allows to re-use the addition operator + both for addition and concatenation. However, without strong typing, this will almost certainly prove to be a bad idea. From the specs, it looks like ""2"" + 2 will be a concatenation, and 2 + ""2"" a run-time exception (in the absence of implicit conversion from string to number), but experience infirms this: string concatenation happens in both cases (although with a warning in the second one).<p>This seems to directly contradict the first point. Which is it? It should do a dynamic type check and generate a run time exception in both cases. I don't see anything to convince me that ""2"" + 2 will be a concatenation... in the spec.<p>>Thus, isolates are a heavyweight thread control model very much like Perl 5's ithreads. That means that they are good for data isolation, but heavy to use and hungry in memory, because spawning a new isolate will imply cloning all the objects and data structures of the running libraries.<p>There is absolutely nothing that implies this. There is a tiny section in the spec about isolates. They could easily be lightweight like Erlang processes.",1318343066

And there has been no debt crisis: the cost of borrowing has actually fallen for the the United States with thirty year Treasury bonds priced at about 1 percent per year. This is a great time to be the US government since assuming there is a way to invest that money to grow the economy at more than 1 percent per year, it is essentially free money.<p>You confuse fiscal and monetary policy when you talk about the implications for US government debt. Theoretically, there is no debt problem from monetary policy since the money is created out of thin air through leverage by the banking industry and can be destroyed again as quickly as it is created by raising interest rates or reversing open market operations. The possible consequences of increasing the money supply are: (1) inflation happens as more money is pumped into the economy and chases the same number of goods, or (2) the value of the US currency drops internationally as the supply of dollars for sale increases. The thing to remember is that in neither of these cases will problems happen while the economy remains in depression. Inflation is a sign that the economy is at or close to full production. A devalued currency would likewise stimulate exports and reduce the trade deficit with other countries like China, promoting growth and full employment in the process.<p>People like Krugman are complaining because they don't see the US using either monetary or fiscal policy to seriously address the unemployment crisis. Krugman is angry with monetary policy because the bailout of the financial sector is following the ""Japanese"" model: banks are not being forced to realize their losses but are instead forcing the government into an endless loop of subsidization while using the funds not to strengthen their balance sheets so much as engage in the sorts of arbitrage that do not create jobs or promote recovery. If you consider yourself capitalist or believe that business should not be dependent on the government you should agree with him.<p>Krugman also advocates stronger fiscal policy since it is needed. Despite what you may think, it is worth remembering that government spending has FALLEN since 2008 (see: <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2011/09/fiscal-policy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2011/09/fiscal-p...</a>). This is tragic for the employment prospects of your niece since the costs of creating an economy that can employ her are - as pointed out above - practically non-existent. The long-term carrying costs of another 500 billion in fiscal stimulus is around 200 billion, while that amount of spending would increase GDP somewhere between 1 and 1.5 trillion USD. That would create a lot of jobs. If these jobs were financed by issuing more 30 year Treasury Bonds, the cost would total 270 billion in 2042 when they would need to be paid back. And if that seems like a lot of money, remember that the government is paying banks tens of billions more EACH YEAR simply by lending them money at low interest rates and then borrowing it back at higher rates of interest. The fact that the country gets very little boost to GDP for the absurd dance should bother you.<p>As for the rest, I agree there are underlying cultural problems with expectations of entitlement. But it doesn't seem terribly hypocritical for your niece to expect a free ride, especially if the reason she can't get a job is because the banks won't write off their losses, and are instead reliant on government subsidies for their profitability when that money would be better spent on improving the health, welfare and education of US citizens.",1318342718

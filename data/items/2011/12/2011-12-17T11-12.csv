(Of course, most usages of dup2() are in contexts just after a fork() or at the beginning of main(), so I guess this could often be practical; it still seems unfortunate.)",1324123192

With only few friends onboard it's actually really fun and I love the constrains (every review is binded into a location). This gives is better meaning compared to the competition which are trying to do too much or allow people review too different things. It's all about context. The app might be basic but it's clearly a product made in a short time and I respect the founders for putting it out early without much fanfare.<p>It's true that image sharing space has blown up but I feel that TinyReview is more of a review app than image sharing (I use is along with Instagram & Path). It's interesting to see if the team can keep the product simple and make it really useful over time. And most importantly: make it into a business.",1324122912

The file descriptor still points to an open device or connection or file.""""""<p>AIX 5.3: """"""If the close subroutine is interrupted by a signal that is caught, it returns a value of -1, the errno global variable is set to EINTR and the state of the FileDescriptor parameter is closed.""""""<p>So, here we have two Unix implementations--both of which predated POSIX--that have incompatible definitions of close(). I do not feel it is reasonable to demand POSIX solve this, and sure enough: it didn't.<p>Now, maybe that makes POSIX ""useless"" (if what you care about is being able to write code without knowing anything about the target), but I don't think it is fair to claim that the definition of close is ""broken"".<p>In distinction, it clearly states that the behavior is ""unspecified"", which is a bothersome yet practically acceptable tradeoff.

3364065,comment,3363259,3363909,0,0,demallien,,,"There are many reasons for women being difficult to recruit in tech.  Here's one - if you are an intelligent young woman having just finished high school, and about to choose your university courses you might have a look at the expected pay that you will receive in different industries.  You note that in medicine and law women are no longer a minority, and that they receive equal pay, and nearly equal social power as their male counterparts.  You note that in engineering this is not at all the case.  Studies repeatedly show female engineers receiving less than their male counterparts[1].  Women are rarely promoted up in engineering organisations and engineering organisations are unusually hostile to flexible work arrangements[2].<p>The result is that unless you are absolutely passionate about engineering, the reasonable thing to do is to take a pass on engineering, and go for one of the many other rewarding careers available to you.<p>If you want to bring women into the industry, you need to make the industry appealing to women.  With current discriminatory practices that is just not the case, and until that changes, there won't even be an opportunity to recruit women, because those with anything less than a burning passion for the career are going to look elsewhere.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.glassdoor.com/blog/engineering-pay-gap-glassdoor-reveals-many-women-engineers-earn-less-than-men/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.glassdoor.com/blog/engineering-pay-gap-glassdoor-...</a>

In general I like the New Jersey approach of ""push complexity to the caller"", but not in cases like this where it's impossible for the caller to handle the complexity correctly.<p>I have the same issue with eventual consistency, for what it's worth: I'm fine with the fact that my updates might not be globally visible immediately, but I want to have a way that at some point I can <i>know</i> that they have propagated (aka.

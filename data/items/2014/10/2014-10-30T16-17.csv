In a small way, you probably have made our corner of the world a worse place to be in.<p>Why not just ask for 260K? To lie in order to get it may seem like the only way to guarantee a realization of what you are worth, but this fosters a business climate that you ultimately may not want to live in. Companies may feel the need to be more defensive at the negotiating table, put the squeeze on developers in terms of hours or reduced open source contributions, or even to illegally collude in order to force people to stay at their... oh wait that one already happened.<p>A business climate in which parties are faking information can be a dangerous place. It is in our collective best interest to be honest and to foster an environment in which honesty is expected. Think on that the next time you buy a food product.<p>Another example that is more general: company leadership feels the need to produce a certain kind of quarterly  financial result in order to appear favorable to investors or customers. The company that has the most accolades fakes it the most, leading to a lot of pressure on everyone else to do the same. Someone has to pay for this though, often it is paid in increased risk.<p>EDIT: removed irrelevant examples.",1414688375

I seem to recall this sentiment being expressed in King&#x27;s book <i>On Writing</i>, but I may be mis-remembering.  Anyway, it rings true with me.  Read, write, read some more, write some more, lather, rinse, repeat.<p>If you need something to help encourage you to write, consider participating in NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month)[1][2].<p>Also, there are TONS of resources available for people who are working on getting better at writing.  Just go down to any Barnes & Noble store and find the section with the writing books, and you&#x27;ll find shelves full of books on &quot;how to be a better writer&quot;.  Some are aimed at fiction, some non-fiction, some specifically for writers of memoirs, magazine articles, etc.<p>It&#x27;s sort of cliched to say, but <i>The Elements of Style</i> by Strunk and White is excellent, as is <i>Eats, Shoots and Leaves</i>.<p><i>I have been trying to improve my English a little but not having anybody to write to or any need to use English makes me believe that I will be stagnated in a low level profile, and that I will never will achieve the level of mastery and proficiency they show so well in their writing.</i><p>Maybe consider starting a blog in English, and just write about whatever interests you.  It doesn&#x27;t even really matter if you get any readers/followers or not, the important thing is just to write as much as you can.<p>All of this advice is predicated on the idea that you&#x27;re more interested in getting better at <i>written</i> English.  If you want to be a better public speaker the best thing to do is, wait for it... do a lot of speaking!<p>One good way to get yourself some practice speaking is to join a group like Toastmasters[3], if you have a chapter nearby.  If not, there may be a similar group, but you may have to dig a little.  Another option would be to find any local techie user-groups (Linux User&#x27;s Group, Ruby Meetup, Java Meetup, whatever it might be) and offer to present there.  These groups often struggle to find enough speakers to fill their calendars, and any volunteers of usually (in my experience) warmly welcomed.<p>Edit: I just remembered, there is another book, which I found recommended here on HN a while back, and just recently acquired, which I consider excellent.  It&#x27;s called <i>The Pyramid Principle</i>[4], by Barbara Minto.  This book is less about language, and more about structure and organization, in terms of how you present your ideas.

Since it sounds like you&#x27;re not, you&#x27;ll need to find your editor some other way. Here are some ideas.<p>- Take a writing class, ideally in person. Your editors will be the class instructor, and depending on the class structure, your fellow students. One advantage of this approach is that you are given assignments to write about.<p>- Find a writing tutor. This will require either you or your tutor to invent assignments to review and work on. One possible way to do this would be to review your comments on HN, and read the rest of the comments in that thread. Work with your tutor to find the comments you think are better, and think about why that is, and how you could improve your own writing.<p>- Find a writing club or group or workshop. These are typically groups of people who get together informally on a regular basis to review and edit each others&#x27; writing. They are often focused on specific formats--a group of poets, for example, or a people who enjoy writing short stories.",1414688049

You can write well too.<p>As with any skill, there are specific quick hacks you can apply to get a lot of gain really fast, and there are well-worn paths that you should travel to maximize gains and minimize time spent.

I value production over consumption, and so to curb my consumption and increase my production I created a rule for myself: If I read a post on social media(HN, reddit, etc), I have to leave a comment on it. No ifs ands or buts. I almost never actually want to comment, but by the time I&#x27;m done commenting I&#x27;m always glad I did.<p>This is amazing for becoming a better writer and researcher, and forces you to dive into things that you normally would only attain a surface-level understanding of.<p>Every time I decide to go to a social media site, I have to be very conscious of the titles I click on to read. I understand that the moment I begin reading an article, I am committed to adding something of value to the discussion.

I end up learning far more and also upping my ability to explain and present myself in situations where I&#x27;m uncomfortable with the domain.<p>So while I encourage you to practice your writing, I also encourage you to limit your consumption, strongly link your consumption with your practice, and most importantly, <i>step out of your domain knowledge and never be afraid to learn something new.</i>",1414687578

As several others have said, the fact that you didn&#x27;t get an offer doesn&#x27;t mean you weren&#x27;t good enough, it probably means you weren&#x27;t a fit.

Losing a family member is always a sad thing, but if it&#x27;s causing you to have nightmares and lose sleep you should try talking to someone. If this has been going on for a long time you might have depression that won&#x27;t get better by just &#x27;dealing with it&#x27;. I&#x27;d suggest you find someone you feel comfortable talking to about it in person: maybe a friend, or family member, or a therapist. But get some help - depression makes everything seem worse than it is, and if you can get on top of how you feel, not only will you feel better, but it&#x27;ll probably help your job search too.<p>Good luck - and don&#x27;t feel alone.

In my experience, companies want you to be open with them about this, so that they do not lose good candidates by being too slow. If you tell them you&#x27;re interviewing elsewhere or entertaining other offers, they will take that into account. You can straight up tell them what your timeline is like and they will work to accommodate it.<p>(Of course if they&#x27;re not interested in you anyway it doesn&#x27;t matter how many offers you have.)<p>Remember, recruiting is a job too.

I&#x27;ll explain momentarily.<p>Being gay isn&#x27;t easy if you aren&#x27;t in a supportive environment.  Hell, being gay will get you <i>killed</i> in some cultures and countries.  In some places you&#x27;ll merely be shunned and disowned by your family and friends.  As a straight guy, I know this.  How?<p>Because for the last 20 years or so, I&#x27;ve heard this again and again.  The LGBT movement is nothing if not vocal and persistent, even to the point of being heavy-handed.  I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m unsympathetic, I&#x27;m just saying that if there&#x27;s a target demographic for &quot;awareness&quot;, I haven&#x27;t classified to be in that group for <i>years</i>.<p>So when Tim Cook officially announces his sexuality, I&#x27;m well aware that this isn&#x27;t something as casually mentioned as being left-handed, having AB- blood type or a peanut allergy, preferring cats over dogs, or liking the color yellow.  I&#x27;m also aware that for LGBT folks who <i>haven&#x27;t</i> come out, seeing a successful person do so can be encouraging and inspiring.<p>Now regarding my &quot;big deal&quot; reaction...<p>While civilization will never be without bigots of one form or another, if we as a society are ever going to get past racial/gender/sexual issues, then disclosures like Cook&#x27;s <i>need</i> to be unremarkable.  Comparing America&#x27;s reaction to Billy Crystal simply <i>playing</i> a gay man on &quot;Soap&quot; in the 80s to today, it seems like we&#x27;ve come a long way in a relatively short time compared to other social movements.<p>By the same token, an incident earlier this year  demonstrated that the tech industry is probably the one of most gay-<i>friendly</i> business sectors to be in.  Ironically, Brendan Eich was attacked, ostracized and shunned for his beliefs because they <i>weren&#x27;t</i> gay-friendly.  As an outsider, it does not appear that being a gay CEO in the California high-tech industry is as much of a burden as, say, a restaurant owner in Istanbul.<p>Finally, Tim Cook is worth upwards of $400 million.  Like all wealthy individuals, he is generally insulated from contact with the rest of us simply because of his lifestyle: he doesn&#x27;t take the bus, doesn&#x27;t live in an apartment or typical suburban neighborhood, and certainly doesn&#x27;t work in a cubicle.  He likely won&#x27;t encounter <i>hate</i> unless he tries to personally negotiate the opening of an Apple store in Moscow or Tehran.  He&#x27;s not a monster because he&#x27;s rich (as far as I know he might be a really nice guy), but he&#x27;s hardly an &quot;everyman&quot;.  For what it&#x27;s worth, I had a similar reaction when many people were showering Mark Zuckerberg with praise for learning Chinese: hell, if I was that rich, <i>I&#x27;d</i> have time (and money) to learn Chinese from the best tutors.<p>In short, <i>anyone</i> announcing that they&#x27;re gay <i>should</i> garner a &quot;so what?&quot; reaction because as a society we <i>should</i> be moving towards a person&#x27;s actions being more important than their appearance, beliefs, or sexual orientation.  And a multimillionaire making such an announcement today should elicit yawns because he is not representative of a typical person.<p>Edit: Not surprised by the downvote without explanation.

8534038,comment,8533269,8533269,0,0,myrandomcomment,,,"So Arista has a switch with an FPGA - 7124FX. The market for the HFT has crashed. When Arista shipped the 7124S the HFT guys where using Cisco 4900 at 4ms and the 7124S was at 600ns. It was quite a change. The markets went crazy. The chip was called Bali by Fulcrum Microsystems - Intel bought them. The follow on chip Alta was very very very late. Arista did the 7124SX which got the latency down to 500ns. The Bali itself was 300ns but the PHY chips added the additional latency (in and out). This switch replaced the 7124S but there was not a mad rush to upgrade. Going from 4ms to 600ns was an order of magnitude but going from 600ns to 500ns, not so much. Cisco who got killed by Arista in this market spent ~$100M and came up with the Nexus 3548. It had &quot;warp mode&quot; that could do ~50ns. This mode however required lots of pre-planning and was fixed. Market data feeds are multicast. The handoff from the exchange was 1G or even low as 100mb in the Asian markets back then. If you added up every feed you could buy it was around ~3G. You would never do this on one link. The servers for looking at the data would join groups to get the feed. The servers used 10G NICs when the traffic load on them was only around ~100MB. Once again for latency. Serialization delay was the key here. The market order would go back up to the market on another path. The idea was the HFT guys would want to process the data faster then the rest of the people. The link down to them and the link up to order was the same for everyone. If you went into the NYSE colo the cable length to the router was the same if you where in the rack next to it or on the other side of the datacenter. Anyway back to switches. So Arista shipped the 7150 around the same time as Cisco shipped the 3548. It was around 350ns using the Alta chip. The reality was that this was low enough and the traders started to look for other places to tweak.<p>Calling this the fastest switch in the world and then printing 5ns is misleading. It is 5ns as a Layer 1 patch panel. Not really what you want for market data which needs multicast, PIM, IGMP snooping, BPG, ACL, etc.. For the 110s is this multicast with all features enabled? Let me know if I missed a link.<p>BTW, if you look back when the 7124S was released there were others that built a switch based on the Bali chip like BNT. An important point to note is that the chip is line rate multicast but that is not enough. Processing the joins/leaves and programing the chip is a function of the software and that depends on the quality of the code and the CPU system in the switch. Arista won because of this. Here is a link to a bake off from 2010.<p><a href=""http://www.networkworld.com/article/2241525/virtualization/arista--blade-win-top-spot-in-data-center-switch-test.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.networkworld.com/article/2241525/virtualization/a...</a>",1414687201

Advice on HOW to practice may be useful, too.<p>Try summarising other people&#x27;s texts - and don&#x27;t just take each sentence separately and try to make it shorter, take all the ideas in the piece and experiment with reorganising them in your mind and then on the page to produce a more elegant and concise means of expressing them to your reader. Lots of the good HN writers you&#x27;ve noted see the short and compelling &#x27;elevator pitch&#x27; that summarises months of work and aspiration as their greatest challenge. Politicians are always looking for the 10 word phrase that conveys the heart of their policy.<p>Read what you write back to yourself. Aloud. Good writing also tends to be &#x27;performable&#x27; - no rambling subclauses to get lost in, no awkward word combinations that make the speaker (or listener, or reader) stumble and disengage. Be more Harrison Ford and less George Lucas (Han Solo said something like &quot;You can write this stuff, George, but I can&#x27;t say it&quot;)<p>And finally, do exactly what you&#x27;ve started here: Seek advice and feedback. This is a community that shares ideas, so dive in, but ask for comment on how you express them as well as their content. Grab a native speaker and check your idioms. Ask friends to point out the clunky sentences that lets down an otherwise good paragraph.<p>Good luck to you!",1414686843

I know most of these people (including myself) could make substantially more money working at a more established company and that our options are unlikely to be worth more than the salary we will have &quot;sacrificed&quot; by the time an exit opportunity comes along. Now, the reason I&#x27;m at a startup is to learn about doing a startup. But I think most of my peers have zero entrepreneurial ambition. There&#x27;s also a shortage of engineering talent. So.. why are you breaking your back working on someone else&#x27;s dream (and potential fortune) when the incentives (as far as I can tell) don&#x27;t warrant it? If you love hacking, why not keep bank hours at the office and work on your own projects outside of that? I used to buy into the myth that bigger companies that pay proper salaries are like working for some soul-destroying 1960s IBM corporate mediocrity. But now I have friends at bigger companies--the difference seems to be that they have unlimited resources, big annual bonuses, nicer office furniture and less pressure. Otherwise we work on very similar things. Maybe you like to &quot;stay hungry&quot;... well, why not do your own startup instead of staying hungry working on something that will make a handful of people (not including yourself) very rich? I apologize if this comes across as confrontational--that&#x27;s not my intention. I&#x27;m more just kind of baffled, and I assume I&#x27;m missing something, hence the ask. Thanks.",1414686193

Seeing two men kiss on the lips and show affection is, well, weird to them.  You just don&#x27;t see that on mainstream TV these days.

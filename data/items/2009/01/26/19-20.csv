450928,comment,450408,450578,0,0,BigZaphod,,,"""More than 3 days a week at home and you start to lose the benefits.""<p>As someone who has been exclusively working remotely for several years, I'm not so sure about that. I guess it depends what you consider the benefits to be and from which side of the employee/employer fence you're on. Are the benefits that you have a more relaxed and free adult life - in both work and play? Or are you looking for a hack to try to forcibly increase worker productivity beyond that which is attainable with a full time in-office approach?<p>When working just a couple days a week or month remotely, it can feel like a nice break from the distraction-filled office life and so it's natural to treat it as such - maybe you work harder/longer to get the most out of it so as to not squander the special time and privilege. When you're home all day every day, you have to pace yourself or else you'll burn out in a matter of weeks - same as if you worked sun up to sun down in the office everyday. That self-pacing could feel/look like suddenly it becomes less useful to work remote all the time, but I think the reality is that people can only work so hard for so long no matter where they physically locate themselves. (And each person has a different threshold.) If the ""work from home 3 days a week"" thing is really nothing more than a piece of ""aren't we an awesome place to work"" cheese dangling in front of the employees noses, I think eventually that backfires and people burn out more completely (and cynically) - so they begin to slack off on those days at home and think of them as a good time to take a ""much deserved"" break by ""sneaking"" out to have fun during the day. Inevitably the company responds by requiring phone checkins during regular office hours, demanding you be online/IM/email/webcam at certain hours, snidely pointing out how long it takes you to reply to a message, etc. At which point, you might as well go into the office everyday because, frankly, you are getting none of the true benefits of working from home anyway.",1232999928

I am in favor of helping out US workers with things like more or less universal health care and unemployment insurance, but also in favor of letting in immigrants who are capable of taking care of themselves: if you're in the US working, more power to you.  If you're mooching, maybe it's time to move along.<p>Just to get my <i>wife</i> (not some random person) and mother of my daughter into the country is a 3 or 4 month process.  She has a doctorate in biochemistry and speaks English well.  To add insult to injury, she'll apparently have to go through a doctor's examination before she can get a green card, should we decide to go to the US.<p>The US has some serious issues with regards to immigrants, which is especially ironic for a country where a very minimal percentage of the people are really people who have been there for hundreds of years, let alone before 1492.<p>Furthermore, the US has some weird import policies - we can't send prosciutto to my parents because of some BS health regulations (as if Italy didn't care deeply about the quality of its food products).<p>Yes, there are practical issues: Luxembourg couldn't open up its borders to India and China, for instance, without some serious issues, but on the whole, I have to come down in favor of openness and opportunities for foreigners.  Part of that might means some practical measures like loosening the restrictions on H1B workers so they are better able to seek market rates once they've arrived.  Another thing I strongly believe is that if you opened things up between ""wealthy"" nations: US, Canada, Europe, Australia, NZ, etc... there wouldn't be any huge population shifts.<p>...

Indeed you try to avoid inheritance and use composition instead because of the very problem exposed. These examples struck me as a deeply procedural low level way to represent these concepts, although that common simplicity does suggest that really all objects are is a way to do if statements better. That in itself is a idea that everyone knew but few people ever said.<p>I find the GUI editor with a mouse painful and this GUI isn't helping! With a heavily user optimised interface with at the very least some of the smarts of Excel and a lot of hot keys (get rid of the dialogs, stop making me right click to splice etc) then it has some potential.<p>What I think we need is this approach translated into a real language with real libraries that have side effects and all the lovely mess that is a real programming environment. Right now its hard to see just how bad it is for the other 99% of programming that is grabbing from a DB and throwing data on a screen (those poor corporate drones!).<p>How about the author hosts his website with the language!

If the goal is to learn from other programmers, you learn a lot more by sitting next to them.  A lot of it is incidental stuff you would not have thought to ask, like tricks in vi and emacs and etc.  Another reason to work with someone is it provides a kind of social discipline, you feel you have to get something done on the project on a semi-regular basis.  A weekly hacking session at a coffeehouse or someones apartment provides that regular discipline, and because the hacking sessions inevitably end, physical meetings can keep a side project from growing and taking over the rest of your life.<p>The ""just work on a open-source project"" advice isn't that bad, but you should pick something that you would benefit from improving.  It is still a good idea to solict others to help you in a physical meeting, however.  Find people who would benefit from improvement in the same project.<p>I think rather than a website or webapp, what you are looking for is a computer club.  I go to a weekly meeting in Austin of ALE, a linux users group.  We meet 7 pm to 11:30 pm, and we are an ""experimental"" group, in that we never have presentations or a planned agenda -- people bring computers with problems and we fix them, new people show up asking for help learning linux, etc.  There are about 5 people there who come regularly with programming issues, ranging from side-business startup sites that are in php and mysql to hobbiest robots.<p>If you are really serious about this, find a place (possibly your house or apartment) and have a ""Saturday afternoon hack-a-thon"" every week or every other week.  If you provide food and coffee people will come.  Your main problem is likely to be keeping non-programmers from showing up and just talking.<p>If you have trouble finding a place to do this, see if you can locate a co-working or ""jelly"" type place in your area.     A co-working place might let you use the area during non-business hour such as on weekends, and the jelly people probably know all the good coffeehouses.",1232998982

In the same way that the US often forces American-style democracy upon other countries without going through the requisite social changes beforehand, so do Western nations force first-world labor standards on countries that are simply not ready.<p>What we, as modernized nations, should be doing is not unfairly punishing these countries, but rather establishing a roadmap to eliminate these evils through economic development.

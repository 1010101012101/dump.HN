1186949,comment,1186735,1186735,0,0,joshd,,,"I've implemented this before. The site was standard MVC, built in CodeIgniter. I then built a middleware layer that would either decorate the content with a layout template to generate the HTML version or create a JSON structure with linked elements (CSS and JS files) and page title.<p>The JavaScript would parses the incoming JSON and attach listeners to all the elements. It had to do a few tricky things like tracking JS and CSS files and provide alternatives to dom:loaded so scripts could be rerun on dynamically loading content. Really Simple History was then used to track the state.<p>I built and tested the functionality as a plain HTML site first then builf the dynamic loader afterward, which was relatively easy to implement. Some of the trickiest parts were gettingand  the DOM to update in a timely fashion and to get the interface to ""feel"" right (when do you clear the old page, when do you scroll user back to top of page, etc.).<p>Like emilis said, there are still a few small cases where the implemetation breaks down, mainly when sending or publishing links. I ended up enforcing clean links: if you hit a HTML page when you had JavaScript enabled it would take you to the homepage and reload your desired page from there. This was mainly because not doing so would make the copy-paste problems worst. E.g. If you expecting to see ""bar"" but had no JavaScript then example.com/foo#bar (showing foo rather than bar) would be more confusing seeing the homepage at example.com/#bar. The redirect logic was the first thing encountered on the page so was pretty quick. E.g. <a href=""http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebeatles.com%2Fuser"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebeatles...</a><p>I wouldn't recommend implementing this unless you absolutely had to. For me the requirement for a streaming music player was a ""must-have"" feature. Even the quickest page load would still lead to skipping music.",1268409528

Look in connection logs of any kind. Leverage other protocols, like email addresses, which are every bit as imperfectly discoverable (but discoverable!) in IPv6 as IPv4. For instance, send an HTML email that ends up requesting something.<p>Besides, it seems to me the botnet attack methods are already no longer based on randomly scanning the internet and hacking Windows; they already work on email, the web, and social engineering. IPv6 doesn't do anything about that (nor can it).",1268409473

In the Wal-Mart case for example, they spent years trying to get compliance from their suppliers, and in the end they had to cut back on their goals and requirements because of the extra steps (and costs) needed.<p>Also, RFID as a commercialized technology is still relatively new (even though it's been around for a long time), and there are a lot of technical hurdles that most people don’t know about.  For example, a standard, Wal-Mart style RFID tag won't read if you hold it close to the body (or put it in a pocket), or put it on metal or liquid; in those cases, you have to use a special tag, or a battery assisted tag (""active rfid"", which can be much more expensive), or an ""RTLS"" tag (wifi, ultra-wideband, etc).

Basically the more people were talking about that subject, the more they hated it.<p>Then suddenly a drop-off of activity and the sentiment abruptly changed to positive.<p>Turns out there was a flood of discussion about some upcoming legislation on the topic and the feeling was generally that it was a stupid law that would cost millions of dollars and not benefit anyone.<p>The law failed and discussion was quickly replaced with people back promoting the failed idea...hence the slowdown in activity and the newly positive sentiment.<p>We used a similar technique on a large number of topic areas an fairly comprehensively mined consumer thinking for a fairly major branding campaign.<p>The morale is that the corporate world <i>is</i> listening to what the bloggers say, just in aggregate and not in too much detail.",1268407742

1186860,comment,1186647,1186647,0,0,grellas,,,"I had posted this article not so much to highlight the faith/atheism issue as to highlight the way judging often works in reality.<p>This case had caused a huge uproar in 2002 when Judge Reinhardt had led a panel in striking down the Pledge as unconstitutional. While no politician would defend the decision, the case went up on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which punted on it by holding that the plaintiff, a gadfly lawyer named Newton Minnow, lacked ""standing"" to bring it - this meant the Court invalidated the decision while avoiding the jurisprudential pit into which it might lead under the Establishment Clause line of cases.<p>The striking thing that happened here is Mr. Minnow found a qualified plaintiff to renew his attack and saw it head to a friendly panel of the Ninth Circuit that seemed highly likely to invalidate the 'under God' language, with Judge Reinhardt and another leading liberal judge - one who had a track record of striking down laws promoting religion in such contexts and who was a 30-year friend of Judge Reinhardt's - constituting two of the three panelists.<p>Yet the decision did <i>not</i> go as expected, and it appears that this resulted as much as anything from a pragmatic decision by the second liberal judge on the panel not to want to go against the political headwinds that the case inevitably presented.<p>I had clerked for a federal court and often saw this sort of thing. Judging may appear ""objective"" or ""disinterested"" but, in reality, where a case is politically charged, the politics often affects the outcome - and that appears to be what happened here. Actually, this is somewhat surprising from the Ninth Circuit appeals court, which has a long history of following its own path on such issues (and hence has a historically high reversal rate in the Supreme Court).<p>Hope this isn't too much ""inside baseball"" stuff. I think it depicts an interesting reality within our courts that many do not appreciate in taking a mere headline view of such decisions. This piece does a fine job of bringing out the human issues that can so affect the judging process.",1268407325

And we start doing it at five years old or whatever, which is far too young to understand the implications of the Oath of Loyalty that you're taking.<p>As an example of a much clearer and better oath, here's the United States Marine Corps Oath: ""I, (name), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God."" Very clear exactly what you're pledging, to whom, and what your duties are, and who you ask if you're not clear on what your duties are. And Marines take it voluntarily, knowing the weight of what it entails.",1268406218

Users don't have to ever leave the tool's main interface (except that listings open a new tab/window), which has had a number of benefits. Making the possible states crawlable by search engines was a pain, but in the end I think the tradeoff was well worth it.<p>EDIT: As swombat says below, though, this isn't a natural fit for all types of websites, and it's a bit hyperbolic/silly to call this the next model of web development.

If I had been able to read more reviews, I would have done so.<p>My main point (which I fear you missed) was that I cannot be <i>violently wrong</i> about the demand for background audio streaming, given that <i>less than one percent</i> of all iPhone OS device users who can use Pandora Radio have rated it.<p>I find your attitude bizarre; Apple didn't ""give in and [add]"" copy/paste. They figured out the right UI/UX metaphors and added the feature when they had it right. Look at the problems that people have been complaining about with the usability of the Nexus One's copy/paste implementation.<p>Apple will do the same with background applications when they get the UI/UX metaphors <i>and</i> the appropriate battery consumption issues dealt with appropriately.<p>Your assessment of the ability to enable background audio streaming ""without interfering with other apps or significantly harming battery life"" is, well, wrong. If this were the case, I wouldn't experience periodic random slowdowns of my iPhone 3G (even in SpringBoard!) that appear to be related to when the radio is waking up and sending or receiving.<p>Your assertion about the battery life is utter nonsense, since streaming audio requires an active data radio (which is a huge battery drain) and CPU activity. The CPU will be required to coordinate the data connection and decode the data from the network stream into an audio stream; if the data isn't in MP3 or AAC format on the network, the CPU will also be required to process the data into one of the supported formats. Remember that all iPhone OS devices have dedicated audio codec chips for processing MP3 and AAC audio.<p>The radio, however, is going to be the key point on battery drain. I stopped using a hands-free Bluetooth headset (I now use a hands-free Bluetooth speaker in the car) because simply having the Bluetooth connection active drained my battery faster than anything else. I tried using my iPhone as a proximity token for my computer at work and found <i>the exact same problem</i> (and absolutely no data was being exchanged).<p>At an OS level yes, it's trivial to schedule this. Above the kernel level, though, it's still pretty damned hard. Achievable, but Apple have shown themselves to be perfectionists, and if iPhone 4.0 is going to allow background audio streaming, it will be because they've figured out how to do it right (and it could easily include restrictions on the format of data being transferred).",1268406014

Of its an especially unruly customer, I have two: fire them or work with them. I will, in my mind, piece together the pros and cons of both, and will come to <i>what I believe</i> is the best decision. You are still deciding your fate and can live with the consequences because they're per your terms.<p>This is why, if I had a small team working on projects, every big decision would require unanimous vote. It's easy for someone to whine about having to work on something they don't believe in, but when you make them part of that decision process, and they consider the factors thoughtfully (like an owner), you give them that peace of mind of knowing they decided their own fate. They tend to come to the same conclusions you do, but aren't bothered by it because they're not doing it ""only because you said so.""",1366383404

5576956,comment,5565424,5574455,2,0,userulluipeste,,,"You understood wrong my statement. Assume that you have two independent connecting channels in the same connecting tube. One is a live low-voltage channel for communication protocol and the other one is high-power (but dead in idle) pumping channel. When you plug the tube you automatically connect both channels. After that, having the info-line established, having assured that the couple has been locked & safe (i.e. insulated), both systems might then agree on opening the second high-power channel. It won't matter if it will take more than a few milliseconds to open or cut the power with the tube being in a safe coupling state. By ""safe coupling state"" I mean that not even the contact with the possible ionized air is allowed, the line being covered/insulated all the way. You just design the systems to not allow power to drain from the source unless it's safe. I also think that it's already time to design all the systems like that, not only the high-power car-recharging ones. This would make a difference in lives saved.",1366383323

Definitely read books, and take advantage of the fact you can get a 100% free CS education from MIT in the comfort of your home. I hope I didn't come across too abrasive, I've just seen a lot of symptoms lately in your generation of people who want to show up to work and get paid for stealing time from the rest of the team instead of doing some self-learning. Your learning track mirrors mine too much to let you fall into this trap. Learn how to learn.<p>I will suggest the following advice; take it with whatever worth you might... work on improving Gamebrave. A LOT of developers I hire and work with love to constantly move to something new, something that will challenge them in a new way, allow them to use their new abilities, new technologies, etc. Resist this desire, and you will find success. Those developers come and go, and I certainly spent my own time doing this. But starting new is easy. It's not difficult to get through the hello world phase and get something started. What's truly difficult is pushing something past that plateau feeling into something even better or more effective.<p>And it's that skill (of resisting newness) that will get you hired full time, and indeed what I look for. If someone says they get passionate about debugging or refactoring, it's worth a thousand people who like starting from scratch. So go and open up your old code, improve it, maybe figure out how to turn that sucker into some passive income, figure out a way to get people there. Trust me, learning this Zen of development will be much better for your future career (assuming you want to do this full time). There's a reason that old OS/2 and mainframe people get jobs worth twice what their peers get for slinging javascript.",1366383177

Every increase in debt must be balanced with a reasonable objective expectation that it will facilitate specific & significant increase in revenue greater than the debt and servicing thereof. If you've spent your paycheck, you buy rice & beans cooked at home instead of swiping the credit card on an expensive dinner out; if your car is out of gas, you borrow just enough to buy just enough get to work (or try walking/biking if at all sensible) instead of filling it up and heading out for an impromptu road trip.<p>National economics is of course complex and subtle, but the point is basic principles apply: if you don't have the money, don't borrow any unless not doing so will cost you much more, and unless you have a clear plan to pay it off. The Ryan plan (and plans of other austerity backers) is ""stop spending money where it won't pay off"", as in stop paying people to not work when they could, stop funding obscure/pointless/offensive projects/research/art which wastes money, stop hoping that prolific spending will change for the good.<p>Wealth is not durable. Spending $1,000,000 to create a $50,000/year job is stupid (and yes, there's a lot of that going on).",1366383023

5576788,comment,5576304,5576304,3,0,nwatson,,,"The very premise that the value of a ""fuel"" is in its energy content alone is wrong.  We'd be quick to lower the value of a ""dirty Joule"" (eg coal) compared to a ""clean Joule"" (hydrogen).  Also, some fuels are inherently much cheaper to extract than others (coal is so cheap, and hydrogen so expensive).  These costs of extraction also change over time -- ten years ago some applications naturally called for liquid fossil fuels (heating oil, diesel, gasoline), but after the fracking revolution a new operation starting today would better and more cheaply use natural gas.  Natural gas will continue to be cheaper for some industrial applications in some areas until deployed fuel-using industrial capital equipment and vehicles using natural gas increases to take advantage of the cheaper energy.<p>Other factors that affect the pricing of a ""Joule"":  convenience of application (I can't burn coal in my car, I pay a premium for gasoline; gasoline won't get me to the moon, I pay a premium for rocket fuel); ease of refining the mined resource into finished product form; ease of transporting fuels from source to ""refinery"" to distribution to end user; we'll pay a premium for fuels with a reliable steady supply; outside risks, e.g., political unrest in the Middle East increasing production costs and risk.<p>The ""joule"" measure for the value of a fuel is flawed.  We already have a great measure for the value of a fuel, it is the US$.<p>Also, as many point out, the energy required to create a bitcoin has little bearing on its value.  Energy costs help determine the mining effort and technology put toward mining bitcoin, but the value of a BTC will fluctuate depending on other factors.  The total energy required to manufacture, transport components of, and assemble a house, along with the ""inherent"" value of those materials, is less than the US$-denominated utility of that house.  If I shock a turd with the same energy used to build the house, it doesn't have any value approaching that of the house unless I'm Andy Warhol.",1366381645

Essentially, I think VC-istan and MegaCorps are both dead ends when it comes to genuine technical excellence (which weird people like us care about). I think it's time to have a serious conversation about financing a fleet of mid-growth K-strategist startups instead of these red-ocean, r-strategist, get-big-or-die marketing gambits.<p>Here's an insane thought that I had that just might work. Find a Midwestern city that has $25 million to blow on becoming a top technology hub and set up an Autonomy Fund. (I'll do the ""grunt work"" of screening for talent; if this idea has legs I'd drop everything to implement it.) 100 top-notch programmers, $125k per year (out of which their resource/AWS costs come, so no one's living high on the hog), and 2 years. First, these companies are designed to become profitable, not to <i>exit</i>, so compensation is profit-sharing, not the joke equity offered by VC-istan. The city that funds this takes a 37.5% profit-share of whatever they build (it's valuating their work at $333k per year, which is lower than a VC valuation, but the terms are better.) If it works, then add time to the schedule (i.e. more years of life and more startups) and possibly more engineers. This is like Y Combinator, but without the feeder-into-VC dynamic; it's to build real businesses that generating lasting value both to a geographical area and to technology itself.<p>I seriously think that Autonomy Funds are going to be big in the next 10 years-- VC-istan is essentially a shitty implementation of an Autonomy Fund, except with selection based on connections rather than technical ability-- but there are some obvious problems (moral hazard, principal-agent issues) that need to be solved.",1366380492

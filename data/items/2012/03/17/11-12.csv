And even if it was true it's not a result of anything intrinsic to the app model. Also ""tight control a la Apple"" indicates that you missed his point.<p>How many times did you do make and sudo installed shit on your system to get basic app that should for all intents and purposes be walled of in a sandbox ? Even without sudo why should install script have access to my personal files without explicit permissions ? Did you run in to a situation where you wanted to install the latest version of an app for your system but it wasn't in your distro repo so you decided to build it only to find out that your repo GTK+ library was out of date and your options were rebuild all GTK+ packages or update the OS to alpha ? Even I gave up at that point - imagine the average user wanting to get the latest feature advertised on his favorite app site.<p>I use Linux desktop daily but it can be a hell and you need to know how to wrestle with the system, it's certainly not idiot proof - and it needs to be for mass adoption. But then again ""mass adoption"" (IMO) shouldn't even be considered a realistic goal, being useful to techies/developers and available on servers is a good objective too.",1331985598
3716876,comment,3716781,3716781,3,0,Edootjuh,,,"I disagree. The author seems to forget the fact that packages are only a layer of added ease of installing new software. The act of installing new software from source or binaries distributed by the author is still as free as ever.<p>I admit that I do install about 90% of my programs as packages, but the problem of central authorities responsible for patching and distributing software and taking too long to do it isn't present in every distribution. I've used Arch Linux for years now, and it solves this problem by separating the packages into an 'official' channel of reliable maintainers testing and releasing new versions on the package system and a user repository where anyone can add packages.<p>To me, this seems like the optimal solution. Community-maintained packages can be promoted to official ones, from what I can see new versions are released from testing within days and if you're not satisfied with how others maintain the packages, building the packages from the newest versions yourself is almost as easy as installing binaries from the repository because anyone can use the build and packaging scripts used by the maintainers themselves.",1331985589

This comes through at some level to your site visitors. \nIf you are blogging then it is usually best to keep this blog within a certain field. \nLook at what blogs you regularly read. What is it about those blogs that keeps you going back for more. \nDon't go chasing readers or potential employers. If your content is good, relevant and informative in a certain field then word soon spreads and your users will come back for more. \nIm not saying that sticking to a certain field is the only way forward as we all have opinions about most subjects that crop up in our daily lives but usually it is good practice for gaining regular visitors to your blog. \nA narrow subject field helps to target a certain type of visitor thus encouraging the right type of target audience. e.g potential employers. \nAfter all is said and done the best thing to do is just get it down on paper and go for it.

3716871,comment,3716781,3716781,9,0,programminggeek,,,"The author is right mostly, the problem is friction and market dynamics. Adding software in a given linux distro is too nerdy. If you don't have an ""app store"" like gui, you've already lost most users. Command line = friction for most users, even a lot of developers who grew up with windows.<p>As a linux nerd, I'm fine with command line + synaptic, but look at how well people have used the iTunes store, Amazon store, Google Play, etc... All of those have much less friction to find and download the right software than most linux distro's have. Ubuntu's market is close but...<p>WHERE IS THE NON FREE SOFTWARE?!!<p>If linux wants to do well for humans, paid, proprietary software NEEDS to exist on the platform. Ubuntu Software Center comes close, but it still kind of sucks.<p>Also, as a dev, it wasn't until VERY recently that you could even sign up to publish an app that was commercial in nature. It is hard to build a real marketplace when you're asking developers to give away all their work for free so that you can sell more operating systems (or support contracts) without the software dev seeing a dime.<p>As a software developer I can't feed my kids with free downloads on an open source operating system used by people who don't like paying for software.<p>Make it easy for devs to build software that people will pay for, then get operating system users who will buy that software for real money and you'll have fixed the Linux Desktop problem.",1331985362

3716866,comment,3716779,3716807,1,0,dspillett,,,"<i>> Some of the tests they link prove the opposite of what they say in the slides.</i><p>The content can't be seen without signing in and it would appear that I've forgotten the password for my fake-details account, so I can't look at the code specifically.<p><i>But</i> I can say that it is not unexpected that the results one person gets can diverge significantly when someone else tries the same test. A lot of code rearrangements that are intended to speed up Javascript execution are optimised for a particular browser (or, if people are being more thorough, a particular subset of browsers). What is optimal for Firefox's engine is not necessarily so for Chrome's, and performance metrics can vary significantly between different versions of the same browser as changes are made to optimisations within the code interpreter/compiler over time. Heck, even exactly the same version of Firefox may behave differently performance-wise on Linux than Windows.<p>You can never say that a given ""trick"" is an optimisation <i>generally</i> because there are many variables. Unless of course what you are actually doing is optimising your logic rather than rearranging it (i.e. changing from something that is akin to a linear search to something that has a logarithmic growth pattern) but that isn't optimising Javascript, it is optimising the algorithm you've implemented using the language.<p><i>> Also, saying that eval is not evil is evil.</i><p>There are very specific circumstances when eval() can be used with relative safety [i.e. when the only injection method is by direct code manipulation, and all client-side Javascript is susceptible to that with or without eval()]. Other than that I agree, and none of the cases where eval() is safe that spring to mind can't be implemented some other way (at least in modern browsers).",1331985272

Amidst America's large geographic size, high population, and many different cultures, there are two warring factions that will ultimately split the country in two.<p>There are those that espouse the views of the author, where privileges are derived from a central government composed of only the most intelligent and gifted members of society.  The means of production are centrally controlled and wealth is distributed by whatever means dictated by the core elite.<p>And then there are those that want to live free.  Those that believe that rights come from nature and from god, and that government cannot create rights, only take them away.<p>These two ideas cannot coexist in one nation.  America has survived with both so far because of our size.  But soon the division will be too great and we will hopefully go our separate ways.  We tried once before.",1345305524

After replacing the iPhone 4 battery turned into a bomb of deadly fumes.<p>My sister's iPhone's battery was swelling and not holding a charge. I figured I work at sprint, I've taken apart plenty of phones, it shouldn't take long- easy fix. I removed both of the screws at the bottom of the case and removed the rear cover.<p>After the rear cover was removed I went ahead and undid the screw that was holding the ribbon flush onto the logic board so that I could remove the battery. I went to pull on the tab and I noticed the right side of the battery pack bent. Next thing you know my room is flooded with Lithium Ion battery smoke, the phone is getting extremely hot in my hands, and sparks coming from the battery all at the same time. I dropped the phone to the ground and rushed to open the windows and door in the room at the same time yelling at my sister to get out of the room because the fumes are toxic. At this point I'm freaking out ( I've never had this happen to me before ), my sister is on the floor kneeling on the couch outside my door coughing her lungs up.<p>I contacted Apple shortly after that and got assigned dillonlong@apple.com. They offered me a refurbished unit for 160.00 after 1-2 weeks of no updates or calls. It's been two months now and they've done nothing to fix the issue all I'm asking is for them to replace the unit.<p>Apple claims I voided the manufacturer warranty by opening the phone and attempting to replace the battery myself. Let me ask you a question? what would have been the outcome if I had not attempted to change the battery and it would have blew up in my sisters pocket at school or at work.<p>I've included pictures of the phone in my dropbox below. Oh yeah the bio-hazard bag is compliments of Apple :) so even though they claim I've voided my warranty and they can not replace the unit at no cost I want them to understand one thing YOUR DEVICE BLEW UP IN MY HAND.<p>I'm posting this here in hopes some one can help me with this situation I've left numerous voice and email messages for my case worker and I've gotten no response I'm assuming they've tossed the case.<p>https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2fwmnstfz71lrxy/uhARqE1lg7",1345304422

Compared to OS X 10.7/10.8, the Unity, GNOME Shell, and KDE desktops all looked like shit at 2880 x 1800 on the Retina MacBook Pro. The text was difficult to read and even when toying around with different scaling factors, the text ended up looking awkward in relation to icons and other visuals.<p>I wonder how could a better resolution make the text more difficult to read.

Any type of damage to the equipment would be accountable to the person who stayed there.<p>- There would need to be persons responsible for maintaining these units 24 hrs a day. That person could be responsible for units in one space, or an area depending on use frequency. The unit would not be available until serviced after every use.<p>- Make the unit more transparent. Use tinted glass instead of opaque walls. Tinted enough to block out bright light, but not opaque so that inhabitant(s) are not free to do whatever they want. this is just a more comfortable way to nap/relax and not an actual hotel.",1345302239

The Japanese are much more respectful of other people's/business's property than Americans and are much less likely to be using drugs (and although prostitution is widespread, the prostitute/john won't trash the place). That's why completely automated vending machine-style systems, such as those used by capsule hotels and many love hotels, are feasible in Japan. The success of a similar system in the US will hinge on whether the increased costs from running it in America will keep things profitable.<p>The best solution I can see at the moment is to accept only credit cards and then charge heavy fines/institute a ban for trashing the place.",1345302157

Condorcet is pairwise-comparison voting with the winner being the candidate that wins the highest fraction of pairwise comparisons.<p>In this jargon, ""first past the post"" systems select the person with the highest fraction of being ranked first; this is argued in the literature to be intimately tied to the two-party dominance in the US.",1326592931

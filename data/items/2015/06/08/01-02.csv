9677042,comment,9676317,9677004,0,0,sswaner,,,"Not true.  It is called the autoblock for a reason.  You tie it by wrapping it around your rope.  To descend, you simply apply a slight amount of downward pressure to the top of the knot.  This is the easy to release part.  If you remove that pressure, by just moving your hand off the knot, it instantly grabs and stops all downward movement.   A Prussik will retain most or all of it&#x27;s tension, making it difficult to use in ascending or descending.   I only use a Prussik in a situation where I want no movement at all for the duration, such as a backup to an anchor.",1433728650
9677041,comment,9676817,9676817,0,0,cardmagic,,,"I assume you are trying to convince people to use what you built?<p>tl;dr _The easiest way to do that is by explaining what&#x27;s in it for your user, up front, and in the clearest terms possible._<p>For years I used to make the mistake of thinking that I should describe the features of my projects and let the the user decide if it solved their problem.<p>Let me show you an example. A friend of mine runs gitwatcher.com<p>Three major areas of prime real estate used to describe features, a little similar to your landing page.<p>The reason that features don’t make for good geek marketing is 2-fold:<p>1) People are lazy. Especially geeks. Almost nobody reads anything but the headers from your website.<p>2) If someone needs to decide whether or not they are interested in a feature, they need to think about all problems they are facing right now and see if the feature would apply to any one of them (e.g. do I really need to categorize by tagging and watch and compare right now?).<p>It’s a mental for-each loop. O(N). Most people are lazy. So they won’t.<p>Instead, talk about the problems that your side projects solve. Make it exceedingly easy for people to know what’s in it for them.<p>For example, if you look at shareasimage.com you will see their headline isn’t utilitarian like “we create images with text in them for you.”<p>It’s a solution-oriented pitch about the direct value you get for using your their product: &quot;The fastest way to\ndouble your social engagement.&quot;<p>Notice also the clear call-to-action. There is only ONE place that it is clear you should click.<p>To use the gitwatcher.com example, instead of selling features like “Categorizing by tagging,” you might try more solution-oriented sentences like:<p>“The easiest way to keep up with the coolest new open-source projects?”<p>“Want to get a free weekly email digest with the GitHub projects you should be keeping an eye on?”<p>Skip the for-each loops and let your readers do a O(1) mental operation. If you tell them the problems you solve, they can instantly know YES or NO. No mental processing necessary",1433728649

9677039,comment,9675697,9675697,0,0,avodonosov,,,"> The gist is to frequently re-render a complete and lightweight representation of the DOM, then apply a difference filter to detect the minimum changes that need to be made to the DOM. A similar technique has existed in game development long before React: re-render the game screen in every game loop, but only update the minimum portion of the screen which changed compared to the previously rendered screen.<p>Practically every desktop UI works that way (Windows API, X Windows, Java UI libs).

Meaning that&#x27;s it&#x27;s perfectly fine to do the action without the intent, even for years, even for their whole life. Not just OK, but actually encouraged.<p>(They saying applies also to smaller things than belief, for example someone who gives charity not to help someone, but because they like being praised is still lauded for their action. Eventually they will come to give charity to help someone, rather than for what they get from it.)",1433728598

IME, and that of the guides who recommended it to me, this is far less likely to cause jamming problems than a traditional single or double prussik.<p>For ascending, I believe their recommendation was to use a traditional single prussik for the harness, and this for the leg loop. This is certainly easier to move up an untensioned rope than a traditional prussik, but may also slip slightly more readily, I think.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve used it mainly as a backup when abseiling; I can&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s not universally used there (attached to leg-loop and below the abseil device) - you just keep your hand on it and it will allow descent, let go or allow it to move up and you are stopped.",1433728478

9677022,comment,9672249,9672708,0,0,peyoNYC,,,"Market share is misleading as high speed trains have been deployed on only a few corridors. These are expensive systems that need high volumes - in which case they work. Checking train share of market by corridor gives a better view. \nRegarding info from Cato or Reason, I&#x27;d take it with caution. They used to produce good research but unfortunately they seem to be driven by ideological choices more than facts. Still a good read but needs fact-checking. \nLast - about environmentalists: the overall impact of high speed train depends on how many people ride it. California should be a no brainer as traffic potential is huge. I wouldn&#x27;t say the same of Spain (where lines are under used). \nOverall: don&#x27;t trust the definitive arguments. Most people have hidden agendas on the high speed rail topic. \nFrom a realistic analysis of facts, you may conclude that California hsr should easily be a commercial success, therefore environmentally good, and has a good chance to be profitable if properly managed/built. \nTexas hsr is the same. North east has a great potential but the costs are so high that just a small deviation ends up in huge sums of money in overspent. Guaranteed commercial success but risky from a construction/financial standpoint.\nOther projects can be more questionable. I&#x27;ve participated to a review of all them for a potential investor and this is what I remember of it. Don&#x27;t take it as truth, check the facts.",1433728166

Of course, when faced with a $550m -> $100m decline in their Atlantic City revenues, that is a huge shift in the industry.  But still, even as Las Vegas recovers, so too has Caesers hasn&#x27;t!  Too much legacy baggage.<p>So back to my central thesis, what kind of responsibility do corporate masters have to build anti-fragile and reliable companies?  One interesting thing here is the lack of stakeholder lawsuits quotes in the article (although apparently there were some, as a different commenter noted).<p>In the end, the legal arena is where these matters of &#x27;morality&#x27; (in-so-far as it exists in a legal sense for this area) play out and are decided. The only downside is it takes a long time, and costs a lot of money.  Not sure if there is any advantages to moving this kind of adjudication farther into regulatory or government divisions.

You&#x27;ve got a user table, with an id column and a &quot;deactivated&quot; column.  Then you&#x27;ve got an OAuth tokens table, with a foreign key column to userid.<p>If you had two microservices hitting the same database, then you make a DELETE to the user service, which now needs to send a DELETE to the OAuth service.  Now, regardless of which transaction you logically have go first, you have a race: two services with separate transactions are modifying the same DB.  Whichever transaction commits, the other could fail, leaving your external view inconsistent.<p>One way to solve this is to have the OAuth service check the user table to see if the user is disabled, and treat all of the tokens for that user as deactivated, but then your OAuth service is tightly coupled to your user service&#x27;s schema, which means you can no longer modify the two services separately.  My impression is that this isn&#x27;t really what people mean when they say &quot;microservices&quot;.<p>Another option is to have the OAuth service ask the user service if the user is still live, but now you have a circular dependency between services, and either one failing can effectively put the other out of commission.<p>Tradeoffs in all things.",1433727753

If you doubt me, ask them.<p>It should be clear from my other comments that I am concerned with the principle of excluding people from apolitical fora on the grounds of racism alone. How justified or controversial it is to call someone a racist  fails to engage the argument that it&#x27;s a social evil to apply that test.<p>As to the technical value of Urbit itself, having passed a process explicitly designed to support neutral evaluation (blind review and ranking) it&#x27;s unfair to start picking holes. (One thing I saw was a bit of point-and-laugh at the style of the C code used to implement it, which frankly is no worse or different than I&#x27;ve seen used in some more obscure languages like False, for example.)",1433725220

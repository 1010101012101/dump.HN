8509225,comment,8503025,8503025,0,0,paperstreet7,,,"It seems to me they&#x27;re trying to use the popularity of Angular.js to bring AtScript on the scene. Everyone who doesn&#x27;t like JS tries to replace it with his own language or at least fix it. There are tons of different compilers that hide real JS from their eyes behind language x but when it comes to realtime debugging they inevitably have to dig into some real JavaScript generated by those tools. AtScript is not an exception here.",1414267109

8509223,comment,8507176,8507654,0,0,kentonv,,,"To be clear, the thing that you&#x27;d think would be a problem in dynamic languages -- lack of pointer arithmetic -- actually isn&#x27;t a problem. Every language has a way to extract values from a byte string, e.g. the `struct` module in Python, TypedArrays in Javascript, ByteBuffer in Java, etc.<p>The real problem in dynamic languages is that they tend to be worse at inlining accessor functions. This is not really because inlining is impossible -- v8 can do it -- but because most dynamic languages don&#x27;t prioritize performance in the first place and so haven&#x27;t implemented such optimizations. This is actually a problem in Go as well, weirdly. Because of this, if you actually intend to consume most of the content of a message, it may make sense to parse it into a language-native data structure up front so that access doesn&#x27;t need to go through accessor functions. Most Cap&#x27;n Proto implementations support this. Doing this will still be much faster than using Protobufs because the Cap&#x27;n Proto format is naturally faster to decode.<p>As David says, &quot;Cap&#x27;n&quot; should be pronounced like &quot;happen&quot;, though pronouncing it as &quot;captain&quot; is OK as well (and will still get people to the right place if they Google it).",1414267077

8509180,comment,8508478,8509044,0,0,_delirium,,,"That&#x27;s one approach, yeah. I used to think it was a likely one, but I now think three others are more likely:<p>1. A language that is low-level and safe <i>but also</i> gives you enough interesting & new to build some buzz/interest, rather than &quot;just&quot; safety. Rust is a candidate here, perhaps.<p>2. Static analyzers in C advance to the point where a subset of C large enough to be useful can be routinely checked for common types of errors. And it then becomes socially expected that at least core OS stuff will be written in that &quot;checkable&quot; subset of C, treating &quot;unable to prove safety&quot; warnings as errors, or at the very least as suspicious.<p>3. Mitigate it at the OS level with finer-grained access controls. Utilities like strings(1) or objdump(1) are the easy case here: they do not need to actually have permissions other than &quot;read a file&quot; and &quot;print to output&quot;. Even in the worst case, arbitrary code execution in objdump(1) should not be able to delete your home directory, join a botnet, or email your ssh key somewhere, because objdump(1) does not need those permissions. FreeBSD&#x27;s libcapsicum looks promising, in the sense that it is actually being implemented in the base system, rather than just being yet another ACL proposal going nowhere (Solaris/Illumos also has an actually-shipped privileges system, but I don&#x27;t know how extensively the base install itself uses it).",1414266489

Morbidly obese would be like 250lb+ at your height, at least in the US.<p>2. If you start with light weight and follow the linear progression of a program like StrongLifts, you will not likely hurt yourself. Weight lifting is safer than most forms of cardio, especially when practiced with good form. It would be helpful if you have a place you can exercise where there is a squat cage, so that you can use safety pins, but it is also not that hard to get out from under a squat. Search for &quot;how to safely fail a squat&quot; for more info.<p>3. It will be helpful to have a coach or a knowledgeable friend to check your form. Preferably someone who often squats big already. In a pinch, you can video yourself doing and ask for advice on a forum, or even me, if you want my inexpert opinion. Respect the depth! (That means, squat until the crease of your hip is below your knee.)<p>4. I would guess that a bigger guy like yourself will find it very easy to make progress early on. I do not think that it is likely you would paralyze yourself doing stronglifts.<p>5. Soreness is a big problem for the first 2-4 weeks, but your muscles will begin recovering faster after that. You should work out through the soreness, at whatever level of weight you can manage.<p>6. You will make strength gains more efficiently by supplementing with protein and creatine, and reducing carbs in your diet in favor of fats and proteins.<p>----<p>You asked about my initial level of fitness.

I am not claiming this is good form. I am very much a work in progress.<p>I am by no means strong, but many of my lifts have reached the intermediate level of strength. They were all way below beginner when I started.<p>The only thing I&#x27;d add is that if you want your arms to look good, you&#x27;re going to need to throw in some curls, because stronglifts does not focus on the bicep. It is a show-muscle -- you don&#x27;t really use it for much, but it&#x27;s important for appearing strong in our culture.<p>In short, I&#x27;d recommend the barbell to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have a particular bone, tendon, or muscle disease.

Misspellings resulting in AttributeErrors are generally caught pretty quickly, and this addition to standard error reporting would mostly be useful in interactive settings where the mistake would be obvious.<p>(Note that linting tools like PyFlakes already do a fairly good job of picking up on NameErrors, which result from using variables that don&#x27;t exist.)<p>I have two other approaches to supplement error reporting with spelling suggestions (<a href=""https://gist.github.com/dutc/3f2c79048d95287be138"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/dutc/3f2c79048d95287be138</a>) that are a little less ‘janky.’<p>What makes this approach particularly offensive are:<p>- I implement this by hooking into a C function in the Python interpreter itself, `PyObject_GetAttr`: <a href=""https://github.com/dutc/didyoumean/blob/2c9f01d03c1574f93155df6c6e3b59b914bacf20/src/didyoumean.c#L147"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dutc/didyoumean/blob/2c9f01d03c1574f93155...</a><p>- I find the function, unprotect its memory page, then clobber first few assembly instructions with a jump: <a href=""https://github.com/dutc/didyoumean/blob/2c9f01d03c1574f93155df6c6e3b59b914bacf20/src/hook.c#L29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dutc/didyoumean/blob/2c9f01d03c1574f93155...</a><p>- I need to jump to an absolute address, since I don&#x27;t want to (or can&#x27;t?) calculate the relative addresses. I don&#x27;t believe I can do this with a `push` and a `ret` or with a regular `call`, so I use a `jmp` instruction. The `jmp` instruction won&#x27;t take an absolute address as an immediate value, so I have to use the `%rax` register: <a href=""https://github.com/dutc/didyoumean/blob/2c9f01d03c1574f93155df6c6e3b59b914bacf20/src/hook.c#L12"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dutc/didyoumean/blob/2c9f01d03c1574f93155...</a><p>- Since I&#x27;m using this register, I have to save & restore its value. In the hooking code, I save its value with a `push %rax`. In order to restore its value, I have to patch the assembly for the hook function to stick a `pop %rax` before any other instructions: <a href=""https://github.com/dutc/didyoumean/blob/2c9f01d03c1574f93155df6c6e3b59b914bacf20/src/hook.c#L50"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dutc/didyoumean/blob/2c9f01d03c1574f93155...</a><p>- In order to figure out the candidates for the spelling correction, I need to call `dir` on the object. But `dir` calls`PyObject_GetAttr` internally, and those calls can themselves trigger exceptions. In order to avoid this unbounded recursion, I have to implement a parallel code-path for `dir` by creating a `safe_PyObject_Dir`: <a href=""https://github.com/dutc/didyoumean/blob/2c9f01d03c1574f93155df6c6e3b59b914bacf20/src/safe_PyObject_Dir.c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dutc/didyoumean/blob/2c9f01d03c1574f93155...</a><p>- In some builds of Python, the internal CFunction which provides the Python builtin function `getattr()`, `builtin_getattr`, is compiled without explicit calls to `PyObject_GetAttr`. In order to hook into these `getattr` calls, I need to patch the builtin module. But because someone could have already gotten a handle on `getattr`, I need to directly patch the function: <a href=""https://github.com/dutc/didyoumean/blob/2c9f01d03c1574f93155df6c6e3b59b914bacf20/src/didyoumean.c#L150"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dutc/didyoumean/blob/2c9f01d03c1574f93155...</a><p>This approach is probably not portable, and it&#x27;s definitely not a good idea.<p>However, figuring out all these small problems was a great way to put some low-level knowledge to use!",1414265847

One classic place is on the stack; after the random data your function puts on the stack is a bunch of bookkeeping information the compiler puts there, including the address to jump back to when the function returns.  If you read user data onto the stack carelessly, you can overwrite the instruction pointer with attacker-controlled data, and the program will return from the function, jump there, and begin executing code.<p>In this case, he was just fuzzing with &quot;AAAAAAAAAAA&quot; and the program ended up at 0x41414141 (&quot;AAAA&quot;), which is alarming.  The next step would to be to figure out where the input file is in memory, replace AAAA with that address, and replace the data there with code.  Now &quot;strings&quot; is executing CPU instructions that were in the input file.  That&#x27;s bad.<p>Some compilers do workarounds, like putting a canary value between the user data and the compiler data, and checking the canary before returning.  Some compilers also randomize the location where things go in memory, so it&#x27;s harder for an attack to predict that address.  Some OSes set certain pages to &quot;not executable&quot;, so even if an attacker can jump to that memory address, the CPU won&#x27;t run code from there.  None of these are fixes; just barriers for the determined attacker.  (W^X is easy to get around, just call code that&#x27;s already in the binary legitimately, like execve()!)<p>The fix is to only write to memory you&#x27;ve actually allocated; something the C compiler will not help you with.",1414265498

If all the real estate is new and shiny and impressive and nice, it&#x27;s only going to be available to businesses that are already firing on all cylinders. And that&#x27;s great for them, for a while. But the other point she makes is that nothing lasts forever. The conditions that make a business work will eventually change, and in most cases, the kinds of business that worked well at one time won&#x27;t be able to adapt to another. They&#x27;ll just go away.<p>If the city in which this constant drama is playing out has a decent stock of old buildings, there&#x27;s a good chance that there will be another generation of businesses that are better attuned to the times who are ready to move into the high-rent districts. But if a city falls prey to short-term thinking and allows all its cheap neighborhoods to be gobbled up by rapacious developers, it&#x27;s going to find itself driving off a cliff in terms of long range economic viability.<p>In agricultural terms, getting rid of cheap rents is like eating your seed stock.

Collectively and individually they represent excellent examples of engineering. The problem with them is that the problem they are trying to solve basically changed from what Tim Berners-Lee originally tried to solved. He tried to make a hyperlinked document platform, not an app platform.

While you could make a simpler strings(1), which would help people who only use that one, more complex stuff like objdump(1) really does need to parse binaries. And that should be possible to do without worrying about security problems: you&#x27;re just reading a file and extracting some information, which even in the worst case should be possible to do without accidentally executing arbitrary code. It&#x27;s just that libbfd seems to have a lot of bugs, and because it&#x27;s written in an unsafe language, such bugs can not only cause incorrect information or crashes, but sometimes attacker-controlled code execution. But if you don&#x27;t do it via libbfd, you&#x27;re going to need <i>some</i> library that can parse binaries, since many utilities end up needing to do it, and it shouldn&#x27;t be impossible to safely do so.<p>An alternative is to implement a subset of full parsing specifically tailored to each utility. In the case of strings(1) that&#x27;s very simple; in the case of some other utilities it&#x27;s of intermediate complexity; all the way up to some that need to parse every corner of ELF. Whether that produces a bigger or smaller attack surface depends on a lot of factors: each parser might be simpler, but there are many more of them. FreeBSD was contemplating centralizing more of that into a common libelf, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s only GNU who think that&#x27;s a good idea in principle: <a href=""https://wiki.freebsd.org/LibElf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.freebsd.org/LibElf</a>",1414263604

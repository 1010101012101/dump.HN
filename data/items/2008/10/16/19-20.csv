334851,comment,334665,334665,0,0,vlad,,,"What may get lost is that Apple sold 33% the number of computers that Dell did in the same time frame.  As Dell is a big corporate supplier, it is possible that Apple sold as many (or almost as many) personal machines as Dell, and more than any other manufacturer.  Another interesting insight is that corporations install the same software they've already purchased and will continue to do so during a recession, while personal users are able to buy and install software as they see fit--especially those first-time users who are trying to find replacements for their favorite windows software.  So, buyers choose Macs when they have a choice, but choose Dell and HP machines for their companies to run all of their existing software.",1224186384

I think Microsoft are vulnerable here, since they are widely disliked, even hated.<p>Apple's market share in the US is higher than in the rest of the world, because the US market is less price sensitive. But what if Apple brought out a cheap version of the Mac Mini, to capture that sector of the market? It ought to cost no more than $200 and like the existing Mac Mini it would have BYODKM (""Bring your own Display Keyboard and Mouse"") -- but it would also be able to use the old PS/2 keyboards and mice, which many people have in their attics or on an old PC. This would make it a very attractive low cost option.<p>Apple could have as an option on all their computers dual-boot with Linux (maybe using a customised Ubuntu distro), and allow people to run Linux programs in a virtual machine under Mac OS. The number of extra customers this would bring directly is not large, maybe 1% of the total market for new PCs; however it's an influential market sector because most Linux users have less-technical friends who rely on them for advice.<p>One of the drawbacks of running Linux is that it's less likely to be compatible with new hardware than a more mainstream OS. However if the Apple distro and campatibility layer was well-written it would allow and hardware that works with Mac OS to work with Apple's Linux. So many Linux users might go for this option.<p>If Apple did this, I think they could get 20%+ market share in the US by 2009Q4. How could Microsoft respond? Reducing prices probably wouldn't help them much, and Microsoft are too bloated and slow moving to actually produce a good operating system.",1224184680

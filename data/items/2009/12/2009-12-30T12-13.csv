It sucks to post something you're excited about and have lots of people digging into it.<p>I'm not being critical of your tool in particular so much as wary of the flock of thin syntax transformers that have come out lately. They're fun projects, but adding yet another mutually incompatible data format is probably only a net gain under relatively specific circumstances (small teams, for starters). I like Markdown in this regard because it's downwardly compatible with how people would write anyway. You're right that it's at a different level of abstraction, though.<p>And about the name - I'm really tired of hearing the same Monty Python jokes all the time, but that's my problem.",1262177866

I always thought it was because the domain industry itself is so low-end, with very little creativity involved, that the general marketplace can't be any good. Now, BrandStack looks great. I'll probably transfer all my unused domains to them.",1262177684

For instance MarkdownSharp on the face of it isn't just a reimplementation of Markdown in C#, it's a fork of it. As someone who doesn't know C# were I to do an implementation of Markdown I'm not likely to look for improvements in something called MarkdownSharp.",1262177403

I'd already read 3 of the 4 when I came across the list and I read Carnegie's book just because it was on there, after having previously written it off by judging it from the huckster-sounding title. I'm glad I did end up giving it a chance - it should be a required textbook in every high school and college.",1262177088

Not as many as NetBSD, but several.<p>Porting a program that was written primarily with (say) i386 Debian Linux in mind to other platforms is a great way to find bugs due to incorrect assumptions. They may be asymptomatic on systems with 32-bit processors, the same endian-ness, etc., but they're just lying dormant. Patches from porting and the OpenBSD security audits are contributed upstream, too.",1262177074

But I've always been under the impression that it just evolved that way due to lack of over all design.  Do you have anything to back up that it was actively designed to be convoluted and obfuscated?",1262176550

1022329,comment,1022222,1022222,0,0,pmjordan,,,"I see you're using nginx as the reverse proxy. There seem to be a lot of options for reverse HTTP proxying - nginx, apache (mod_proxy), lighttpd, squid, etc. Would you (and/or anyone else) mind talking about choosing the right one? I assume all of them support keeping connections to the backing servers alive to reduce the overhead from opening new TCP connections.<p>Apache seems overkill if it's not also serving up some of the pages, but other than that I'm a bit lost. I'm mainly after multiplexing requests to different server processes (some in VMs) based on Host: header and/or path. Applying gzip/deflate compression where the backing server doesn't support it would be nice too.",1262175709
1022328,comment,1021857,1021857,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"IMO, if Google fails at it so spectacularly (with Google Checkout - a true blight on Google), then this is a hard effing business. If you read ""Founders at Work"", it has a great story/interview with one of the founders of PayPal, Max Levchin. He talks about why PayPal succeeded where others failed. The main gist of it was that PayPal was able to come up with better fraud detection algos and, by doing so, were able to ""save"" tens of millions each month that their competitors were losing to fraud.",1262175589

1022320,comment,1022044,1022114,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"I like the idea as well but I can imagine that $10/hr employees are not trained/educated/{whatever adjective you pick} enough to do the negotiations. The proof is there: they are working for $10/hr. If they had quality skills like that, they wouldn't be making $10/hr in a call center. This means they would require extensive training (which would up the overall cost, particularly the upfront cost to get started).<p>Now as to the idea, I think it falls into the, ""I'd use that"" category from a user perspective and would have a B2C model; in my view of it, you would sell directly to consumers or partner with companies to sell at a discount to their members/userbase.<p>* How do you bill? Do you bill differently for monthly bills (i.e. utilities, car loans) vs. one-time expenses (i.e. jewelry purchase)?<p>* Is this an unbiased service or will your company step in at ""just the right time"" and say, ""You can save $100 on car insurance right now with our preferred provider!""<p>* What is the average amount to be negotiated? 
If it is $100/month bill, then you should be able to negotiate down to $85-$89.99/month. That means you save the customer, on average, $12/month in that scenario. How do you convince me, the customer, that your price is worth my saving $12 a month?<p>* How much did it cost you, the entrepreneur, to save your customer that money? I'd assume it cost a minimum of $7 in raw time on the phone/logging the call and then another $10-$100 in training/software/""misc"" costs depending on what they were negotiating.<p>Anyway, just random thoughts. This is one of those, ""Cool idea but I can't figure out how to actually make money with it"" ideas to me.",1262175173

266131,comment,265452,265861,0,0,13ren,,,"You're welcome - I had seen the schedule on train page, but not the one on the stats page (this may be because I'm on a tiny eee PC, and didn't happen to scroll down... for this (rare) case, I think some sites have subtle guides in the design to suggest the page isn't finished more lower down - I see you have narrow vertical margins, but the RHS is off my screen... as said, a rare case (and it could just be me).<p>It would be nice to know which each deck is scheduled when (just different colours and a key) - ie, the visualization you suggest.<p>But you've basically answered my issue - actually, the basic schedule you have now is <i>very</i> important, because you need to know, so you visit the site when the next learning is scheduled. One way is (optional) email alerts, to remind people. (Of course, a serious user would be at the  site every day anyway).<p>BTW: somehow, the info on train and profile pages seems a bit confused to me... maybe there's a better principle to organize it by, in terms of what the user needs, in their work flow. (but I think it's OK as it is - this is just a refinement).<p>Don't know if any of that helps, but thought I might as well pass on my reactions, just in case they do.",1217840272

RAND licensing is fine if you're a megacorp, but for smaller companies and especially startups it can be a big hurdle.

That's why you should only use it once you have something that can actually impress then tens of thousands of people who'll come and have a look.<p>You say Cuil did a great job on the marketing. Yes, they did. However, most people who went and tried Cuil had a bad experience. That compares very unfavourably with Google, which is unflinchingly brilliant. Result? Sure, Cuil did great by getting (say) a million people to try them on the first day. But of that million, maybe a thousand will actually use them more than once.<p>It's not really worth going through all that PR work if your stick rate is only 0.1%.

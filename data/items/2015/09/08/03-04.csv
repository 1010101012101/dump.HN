It was OK as a web server or mail server or for home-grown number crunching software, but the NFS implementation was full of bugs, and none of the industry-specific commercial software had been ported. Windows 95 was really, really bad - it crashed all the time, barely had a functioning network stack and had no multiuser functionality.<p>BMCs and KVMoIP hadn&#x27;t been invented, so for PC-based servers you needed a keyboard, monitor and set of hands for each rack. SATA hadn&#x27;t been invented either and with PATA you were limited to two drives per controller, no external drives and it was always a crapshoot whether any particular permutation of drives and mobo would actually work. Expansion slots were ISA or mixed ISA/PCI so you got to have fun with IRQ, DMA and I/O address settings. The mechanical design of PC enclosures was awful to mediocre. Sun mechanical design was a little better (retaining springs, etc) and SGI mechanical design was much better (tool free servicing). ECC and parity RAM were exotic on PCs but ubiquitous on Unix workstations, and the operating system actually did the right thing after a parity error rather than either ignoring it or freezing up.<p>Also, regardless of the raw CPU performance, Suns running SunOS seemed more responsive under heavy load than PCs running Linux. I&#x27;m not sure why, and I don&#x27;t have numbers to back it up, but that&#x27;s how it seemed at the time.<p>PC BIOS is <i>still</i> worse today than Sun OpenFirmware was in the 90s, but we put up with it because it&#x27;s good enough and for many applications there&#x27;s no other reasonable game in town.",1441684152

That&#x27;s a terrible benchmark for even for some of the heaviest websites out there!<p>This may not be a popular opinion but I (and many ordinary readers like me) see that link as a website. Not a book.<p>It feels heavy and overwhelming to see a large number of 3D diagrams and visual depictions on just one web-page. Having to scroll down to read the full chapter with all that animation and &quot;motion&quot; is probably a bad move too. Given that this is supposed to come off like a book you can probably ditch the scroll.<p>Ideally, you&#x27;d want to give away few concepts in small easy-to-understand chunks with just 1 or 2 figures per page. And let the reader flip/click over to the next section like it happens with an ibook or kindle book or even a real physical book.<p>IMHO the idea of ripping apart a book at its spine and forcing the loose design of websites over it is a complete no-go for avid book readers. Especially for the mobile and tablet users (probably even for the desktop users!, why else would everyone insist to download PDF, ePub or other artifacts?).

The Japanese offroad bikes are very precisely not designed for street driving, and were repurposed. It also covers backhoes vs diggers, and how people now use backhoes even for normal digging jobs. And hard drive minification. I lent out my copy to our marketing intern, or I&#x27;d pull quotes.<p>It also disagrees with his own quote: &quot;Sustaining innovation makes good products better—but then you don’t buy the old product. They’re replacements. They do not create growth.&quot; Honda didn&#x27;t just take a Ford Falcon design from 5 years ago and sell it at a steep discount. They had designs suitable for the Japanese market, that suddenly became popular when the oil embargo hit in &#x27;73. Because Civics were a substantially different car, the Big 3 couldn&#x27;t just pull their old designs off the shelves, and it&#x27;s not like the market for the Big 3&#x27;s used cars took off.<p>ZTE phones are essentially phones from 2 years ago, at market clearing (lower) price. You don&#x27;t need to reach for disruptive vs sustaining innovation to explain why ZTE is gaining marketshare when simple supply & demand curves will do the trick. AFAICT, the only innovation on display here is making less profits.",1441683689

I would never use Ruby or Perl if I could use Python, for example.  I prefer JSON for serialization(robust and simple) but for manually encoding a complex data structure, YAML is far more comfortable.  That&#x27;s all syntax.

But his point is that most of the arguments people have here over language choice are irrelevant, because whether you&#x27;re using PHP or Python or Ruby or Scala or Go is not the bottleneck in the system.<p>Personally, I agree. I&#x27;ve never seen a bad team succeed because of a good language, and I&#x27;ve never seen a good team fail because of a bad one. We argue over languages not because it makes or breaks companies, but because that&#x27;s the most obvious feature of our days. We form tribes around languages the way non-programmers do around sports teams, and as with sports teams, minor differences get blown up into major social divisions. It&#x27;s our own version of the streetlight effect: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect</a><p>I&#x27;m all for people arguing about language features when they are actually designing languages. But as far as building businesses around software, I think &quot;Language X is a secret weapon&quot; is absurd. If a good team picks something they&#x27;re happy working in, then the biggest problem with a project will almost never be the language they picked.",1441681623

When we read a science textbook, all of the information is placed within the structure of the current paradigm, as if none other came before it.<p>To give an example, how much do you know about theories of geology before 1960?  Any educated person today knows the basic idea of plate tectonics, but only a historian of science might know what came before.<p>According to Kuhn, the impression you get that &quot;puzzle pieces are rarely removed&quot; is something that happens after science has been rewritten to fit a new paradigm.",1441681498

It seems like your cultural background is very different from that, which is why we&#x27;re not communicating well.  In my culture, asserting that someone was doing something illegal means that the person has been convicted by a criminal court with respect to that act.  In many systems, saying that someone was doing something illegal without either a conviction or bearing witness under oath to the allegedly criminal act is itself a crime, that of slander or libel.  It seems that you are using a very different definition, one that I don&#x27;t understand.  While I know little of Palau&#x27;s legal traditions, in this case both the CA and its customer had no ties to Palau, and their business relationship was not governed by its laws.  So even if that country and its legal culture does not follow the same principles as mine, it&#x27;s not relevant to this case.  Perhaps that&#x27;s the confusion here?",1441681489

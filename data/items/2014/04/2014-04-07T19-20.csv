7549017,comment,7548001,7548001,3,0,danso,,,"From the OP: &quot;So, What Are Sponsored Comments?&quot;<p>> <i>Sponsored Comments let businesses deliver a message to the people they need to reach. A Sponsored Comment can use all types of media to get their point across, just like any other Disqus comment. But they’re not part of the discussion happening on that thread or community itself. That’s too disruptive.</i><p><i>So instead, they’re pinned to the top of the discussion environment where things are just getting started. It’s like movie previews.</i><p>So...why not call them by their old fashioned name: &quot;ads&quot;? I don&#x27;t disapprove of ad-based models, but something seems a bit disingenuous to use the term &quot;Comments&quot; when they are not &quot;comments&quot; at all. Unless users are able to respond to them and not have their comments hidden.<p>It&#x27;s hard to imagine advertisers being happy about users getting to attach negative comments onto the ads. And if those threads get to be a snark train, then that pushes all the regular discussion down even further. So either the &quot;sponsored comment&quot;-discussions are hidden, or advertisers AND site-users are inconvenienced.",1396900792

There are more than enough people willing to buy a unit to move into it themselves. I&#x27;m 100% anti rent control myself, but to claim landlords are struggling is disingenuous.<p>There is no rule out there that says that landlords have a right to their business model on their terms.

It seems to me that a lot of the HFT folks fall into that category.<p>Others say &quot;the stock market is supposed to exist so that large companies can raise funds for growth&quot;  The market isn&#x27;t a thing that exists unto itself, it&#x27;s a thing that humans created for human purposes.  If something is happening in that market, due to a particular set of incentives that causes human beings (which are the only reason said market exists) to feel that sub-optimal outcomes are happening, well then the rules can be changed.  The market exists to serve humans and if humans aren&#x27;t being served they can change it.<p>So once you have a market structure that exists on smaller time scales than human beings are capable of comprehending everything about &quot;what&#x27;s really going on here&quot; goes right out the window.<p>To human beings water is essential for life and largely speaking pretty harmless.

Most things I&#x27;ve seen on this topic were people complaining and writing, not forcing Mozilla to do anything. The only one that got close to &quot;intimidation&quot; is the OKCupid thing, which is still debatable.<p>> Do these people realise that the exact same arguments were used for the suppression of gays? how are these valid now?<p>Are you seriously comparing the oppression of gay people with the &quot;oppression&quot; of people who have homophobic views? I don&#x27;t think this should be explained to you, but it&#x27;s totally OK to discriminate people because of what they think or the opinions they have; is not OK to discriminate people by what they are. For example, any company should be free to fire White Supremacists, but not to fire white people just for being white. Are you seriously saying that people shouldn&#x27;t dissociate themselves from people whose opinions they find offensive? And you are complaining about political correctness?<p>> But even worse than that is the argument that nothing illegal was done. Yep, the same as stripping Alan Turing of his awards was legal at the time, or put him under &quot;treatment&quot;, or marginalising and ostracising him.<p>Again with this comparison! You seriously need to stop comparing the discrimination of gay people with the discrimination of homophobic people. Next thing you know, you are probably going to argue that LGBT organizations need to accept homophobic managers and volunteers.<p>> look at the lack of compassion as human beings people have for those who dissent in a way that offends them.<p>I&#x27;m not even sure what you are saying here.

I also have a challenge with &#x27;copied for pennies.&#x27; Software you can copy for pennies but hardware really does require some tooling which is not &#x27;pennies&#x27;.<p>There is a market for &#x27;soft&#x27; test equipment. The amount of margin available in that market it something worth debating. I&#x27;ve got a USB oscilloscope that has proprietary software that only works on Windows XP, I&#x27;ve got a Tek475 oscilloscope with similar specs from 1981 that works on anything. They both cost about the same amount (just under $300) The point (for me at least) is that the &#x27;softness&#x27; of test equipment, where it relies on a third party OS/computer to work) has a <i>negative value</i> coefficient. I know that at some point its going to be worthless, unlike the Tek scope which, as long as it can be calibrated, will have intrinsic value.<p>That is what I like about the SUMP based designs that DP did. They took the risk away by publishing all their source and letting me decide if I&#x27;m willing to do the work (or hire someone to do the work) of keeping the test gear running on my current hardware.

Insurance indemnifies against damage that is potentially unrelated to the service itself.<p>The latter difference seems material for something like Airbnb, where the protections you need include liability claims by short-term tenants and liability claims for neighbors, some of which might arise not simply by malicious acts from those tenants but from things like &quot;the tenant left the door unlocked and the whole building got broken into&quot;.<p>Either way: take a closer look at what Abnb is offering here; it&#x27;s not like renter&#x27;s insurance.",1396900298

7548781,comment,7547488,7547936,0,0,malandrew,,,"Your anger is misplaced. The root cause of housing stock is not how people are using the current stock but the complete refusal to amend the situation to build more housing stock. Many landlords (living in their property or renting out) actively oppose rezoning changes that would permit more housing in the city. Those renting out are very much in favor of current zoning because they earn far more money from units because of limited stock.<p>Furthermore, a lot of those I know who have an extra room and rent out on AirBnB are usually renting out to people actively trying to move to the city and need a place to stay (1-3 months) until they find a unit to live in. For those AirBnB hosts that keep a lease, almost all of them that I know are renting out on AirBnB for more than 30 days at a time (usually to people trying to move to the city), because its not convenient or cost effective to manage back to back short-term stays when you aren&#x27;t living in the unit. At the end of the day, those subleasing are usually just absorbing the difference between the rent control they secured originally and market value, which would be absorbed by the landlord anyways the moment the lease was given up. i.e. If Bob rents a rent controlled unit from Alice at $1000 a month and then decides to sublet it at $1500 a month 2 years later to Carol, then Bob is making $500 dollars profit. However if Bob gave up the lease, Alice would rent it out again at $1500 to Carol anyways. Either way, Carol ends up paying $1500 a month.",1396899118

I recently had a couple run-ins with my management company and the last thing they want to do is evict me. They just want me to stop the offending behavior.<p>I think the important thing is the agreement between tenant and landlord (or condo association, etc). From my perspective, if those agreements are specific about no subletting then I don&#x27;t see how it even matters if there is a city-wide ban? There isn&#x27;t a city-wide ban of smoking in residential buildings in Atlanta but I am not allowed to smoke in mine. That seems to be analogous.<p>I believe the fault lies with both AirBnB and the renter. I see people mostly harping on AirBnB and it does seem they could do more to make the renter think about the legality of the situation or check a box stating that they have the legal right to do so. But as a long time renter, I&#x27;ve always been well aware that in every rental agreement I&#x27;ve signed, it is a violation to sublet at least with out consent from my landlord.<p>The idea that there is some connection between morality and abiding by all laws is silly. There are so many ridiculous laws on the books, it is laughable. Over here in Atlanta, it is illegal to engage in oral sex. I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m am a bad person for breaking that law as often as humanly possible.

Everyone is persecuted to some degree. We need to remove the persecution. If we can reduce or remove this societal issue, then people change in positive ways.<p>Politics is never black & white. Prop 8 has positions & a constituency. Even if it does not pass, popular support brings leverage on related issues.<p>> The campaign itself does not seem like it is based on hate.\n> Then what is it based on?<p>It&#x27;s not based on one thing. There are a number of motivations for Prop 8. Some people are motivated by hate. Some people have legitimate issues. I think most supports don&#x27;t approach it from a standpoint of hate.<p>Eich did not seem like a hateful person. He never spoke out publicly against homosexuals. His campaign donation is not speech. It was meant to be private.<p>I&#x27;m for making campaign contribution public. However, we should also be responsible & not jump to conclusions about supporters of a campaign. Maybe it&#x27;s evidence. However, it&#x27;s not proof of anything.<p>If Eich openly discriminated against homosexuals, that&#x27;s one thing. However, supporting a Proposition is not proof.<p>The notion that Prop 8 is H8, is conjecture & a political campaign in itself. It&#x27;s a redefinition that you obviously buy into. I was a supporter, but now I&#x27;m not because it seems to give people license to demonize Prop 8 supporters (without any other evidence of discrimination). I disagree & I think it&#x27;s dangerous to our culture & it&#x27;s dangerous to Progressive movements. This demonization is against the progressive ideal of tolerance & intelligent discussion.<p>Also, the tone of justifiers of this demonization seems off. I&#x27;m often a contrarian & think differently from the crowd. The force of this justification reminds me of how groups will force individuals to change & to stop thinking independently or face ostracization. Ostracization is a powerful force. It&#x27;s has a strong psychological influence on someone&#x27;s well being & happiness. People are often more afraid of ostracization than death.",1396897581

(All of which we regard as suitable target languages for Halide. PTX (CUDA&#x27;s low-level assembly language) and OpenCL are currently supported.) As a concrete example, there is no explicit memory allocation in Halide and loops are often implicit. The overall character of Halide is that of a functional programming language.<p>As another example, segmentation violations due to errors in Halide code are impossible, barring bugs in the compiler implementation or errors in user provided C++ code, which Halide has no control over. Some set of bounds errors are reported at compile time and the rest turn into (efficient) assertion checks at runtime.<p>Schedules do get pretty low-level and writing them is difficult. Algorithms are generally a fair bit easier to write and while there is plenty to be done in improving the language, it is already a step up in productivity over e.g. OpenCL or even straight C++ for a lot of tasks within the domain of data parallel processing.",1396897559

Transition from a flat rate methodology to APR.  This would be more in line with the standard used in most lenders&#x27; countries, but would be more difficult to understand for borrowers.

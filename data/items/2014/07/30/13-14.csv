8108114,comment,8107258,8107911,2,0,geebee,,,"The problem in SF isn&#x27;t that we couldn&#x27;t build up more - we certainly could.  It&#x27;s that you generally have to tear something down to build something up,.  I live in one of the less fashionable parts of SF that is zoned single family, though it is somewhat dense by American standards (small lots, no space between houses, though each house does have a small backyard).  Most of the houses were built in the 1920s and are in my opinion architecturally interesting, though of course opinions will vary.  I suppose we could allow people to buy up a block or a bunch of houses, tear them down, and replace them with 6 story (or higher) apartment buildings.<p>While there is a case to be made for allowing this, I think it&#x27;s probably the weakest place to make your stand against the lack of new housing construction in the bay area.  We have options other than tearing down some of the oldest neighborhoods west of the mississippi.<p>While everyone may be saying Not In My Backyard, there are degrees of NIMBYism.  Personally, I think that it&#x27;s far more egregious for very low density areas like Mountain View or Menlo Park to ban new housing development, especially when these are the same cities that have green lighted office construction that will bring hundreds of thousands of new workers to the region.",1406728682

Proprietor was too narrow a term, and better that I had said that it represents an example of the larger case where outside participation is simple, or non-existent.<p>These are the relevant quotations. If one has simple capital structure and do not desire to structure non-cash employee incentives, and have no need for new rounds of investors who might make new structural demands that conflict with prior agreements of LLC present member/owners, then the LLC is good enough.<p>Quotations:<p>6 – Equity Compensation - Equity compensation in entities taxed as partnerships is much more difficult, complex and expensive to draft and administer than equity compensation in a C or S Corporation.  For example, to grant profits interests in an LLC, it is typically necessary or advisable to “book up” the capital accounts of the owners prior to granting the profits interests, and this must happen at each award. If there are successive rounds of equity grants each year, these books-ups can become very expensive and time consuming.  This same complication occurs with options or warrants to acquire LLC interests.<p>7 – Raising Capital - Raising additional capital through an LLC is much more difficult than raising a next round through a corporation. LLC agreements are more difficult and complex to prepare than their corporate counterparts. In addition, you can hit upon sticky and highly complex tax issues in the LLC context that just don’t exist or arise in the corporate context.",1406728320

The initial shock wave is usually created using a detonator, which uses a very small amount of a much more risky explosive.<p>You can get a lump of C-4, and use it as fuel for a fire to cook over without any danger, and in fact soldiers certainly used to do this. You can also hit it with a hammer - the shock wave caused by this isn&#x27;t strong enough to cause a detonation.<p>In terms of a nuke, you need to detonate a set of independent lumps of explosive with very precise timing, in order to get a compression lens that will squash the fissile core sufficiently to get a nuclear explosion. Heat is unlikely to cause this to happen with a sensibly-designed bomb.",1406728315

8108051,comment,8107057,8107431,2,0,jacquesm,,,"Berlin as a city is doing just fine and compared to just after the wall came down the difference is nothing short of amazing. The amount of money pumped in to the city shows up everywhere, infrastructure and public transport, the quality of the houses and apartments, the number of businesses and so on. This is not correlated at all with start-ups, which simply relates the the size of the home market (to a first approximation, Germany, Switzerland and Austria) and the ability to subsequently expand internationally (which is actually quite hard). I was in Kreuzberg (Berlin neighbourhood) this week and I could barely recognize it compared to what I remembered.<p>Compared to other former east block cities Berlin had of course a head start (half of it was already western), even so the progress is strong. By comparison, London today and London 2 decades ago are not that far apart, whereas Berlin today and Berlin 2 decades ago are worlds apart.<p>As the spoils from Berlin percolate out through the surrounding countryside Berlin will achieve yet another growth phase, what took 50 years to destroy will not be fixed overnight but you can surely rely on Germany to be able to fix such things as fast and thoroughly as possible.",1406727996
8108050,comment,8102308,8105835,1,0,shas3,,,"The U Michigan management academic, C. K. Prahalad (with an Indian science administrator, Mashelkar) had written an article about innovating for the Indian economy in the Harvard Business Review. The summary of their article is that Indian companies tend to figure out a way of innovating around these constraints [1]. They present a few case studies, notably in the mobile telephony and pharma sectors. The companies face pretty much the same problems that you talk about: poor infrastructure, etc. Certainly these can be insurmountable challenges. However, if the market exists, there is incentive to figuring out ways around this. The paper is worth reading to understand how Indian companies innovate.<p>Regarding non-standard addressing systems, etc. Anecdote: in my experience, courier systems are a little different in India than it is in the US. As I remember from my time there (lived there till 2007), the courier system is de-centralized. Local companies with a reasonably good knowledge of the neighborhood, etc. do the &#x27;last-mile&#x27; delivery. The rest is usually managed by nationwide companies, including DHL, etc.<p>[1] C. K.

When I think of an API, I think of a library or something that I can link to. For example the POSIX API, or the P-Threads API. These are available in one way or anther from any language.<p>This seems to think very differently about APIs. As if APIs are somehow tied to a specific language? When they use the term API, do they maybe mean library?<p>I think that under the hood, the idea is that, if you want to do something, in another language (rather than just writing it in the language) you somehow generate a stub in both languages and then proxy through a (network?) connection?<p>To make this more complex, it seems that the proxy connections are not just on the local machine, but over the internet to another machine. Presumably you have to pay for this?<p>Am I right? This seems like a lot of effort to go through just to avoid figuring out how to do something directly. With really sucky performance implications. I guess it depends on what you&#x27;re doing. Most languages support a foreign interface to C, so maybe that is a more sensible way to do this rather than setting up &quot;servers&quot; and tunnelling commands and data back and forth.<p>EDIT: I just had another look at the website. So, when they use the term API - it would seem that they mean some sort of an HTTP based web interface? The idea is that you have some kind of script that does something for you and you can query it from you local script.

Promotion is an important part of marketing, but it&#x27;s not the entirety of it [1]. If the game objectively sucked, then you failed at the &quot;Product&quot; piece of marketing. This is the part where you listen to your customers and make changes to your product to make it more attractive to your target market (you did identify target markets for your games, right?) Product development should be squarely a marketing function; otherwise you&#x27;ll end up building a product that nobody wants (like the original author did).<p>> if you are a small shop where everyone has day jobs and you can endure slower, organic growth? it&#x27;s not worth the money.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s only not important if you&#x27;re not running a business and don&#x27;t expect your app to be successful. Otherwise, marketing sounds pretty important to everyone. &quot;Organic growth&quot; doesn&#x27;t happen in the app economy; you need explosive growth to hit the scale at which you can even begin to start recovering your costs (I recall reading one of these where the guy bought an iPad to develop his game with, and didn&#x27;t even end up covering the cost of the iPad).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix#McCarthy.27s_four_Ps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix#McCarthy.27s_four...</a>",1406726693

Not 100% passive as I spend 3-4 hours per week for answering support emails.<p>ThemeForest is a perfect place for passive income if you are  a website developer. At first it challenges your skills as you need to create the concept, design it and code it. Then it challenges your business, marketing and support skills. You become a one man factory and learn a lot.",1406725698

5687669,comment,5685812,5687513,5,0,bch,,,"> Didn't continue reading I see.<p>I did -- your thoughts are incongruent. If you're trying to improve health and food costs ""in general"", ""generally applicable"" ideas ought to be presented. If I said you can cut your power bill and improve your health by installing bicycle-generators in your house, it glosses over the facts<p><pre><code>  1) you're going to need a battery array\n\n  2) a collection of bicycles and the requisite generator equipment\n\n  3) ability and time to run the generator\n\n  4) can deal with the inconvenience of perhaps not having ""instant-on"" power\n\n  5) live in any place where this is both practical and desirable, for some definitions of ""practical"" and ""desirable""\n</code></pre>\nIt's a throw-away ""solution"" that really doesn't practically add to the conversation.<p>> And yes, I've built computers from scratch<p>On HN this probably isn't so surprising, but in the general populace, I think this sort of thing is considered wizardry. It's not practical for most people.<p>> but you can buy a refurbished one complete for $190 at Best Buy<p>I agree enthusiastically. (though I'd personally hit up Craigslist for an old Thinkpad). I think this (and your above points) touch on something I'm passionate about too: I see what I think is a lot of entitlement and laziness in the world I live in. People want too much, and don't want to ""work"" for it -- not that they don't have jobs, but that they expect needs to be fulfilled by passing a credit card over the counter.<p>I think we may not be too different: My car is a 40 year old Volkswagen that I got for a fraction of the $$ that my friends pay for their autos. <i>I</i> happen to familiar with the air-cooled VW quirks and limitations and live within them. I also do my own engine work and maintenance. I feel <i>good</i> about keeping another car out of the landfill. The $$ cost, though, is a fraction of what I pay. Other costs include<p>1) Occasional valve adjustment, points/timing adjustment, etc<p>2) Driving in a constant state of awareness wrt the machine that   I'm operating; I listen to the engine, transmission, wheel hubs,   and monitor my gauges more than any typical driver I know.<p>3) My car is slow. My trips take longer. I have to drop to second   gear on steep hills.<p>4) I sometime have real mechanical issues. I've repaired a fuel   injector on a road trip. On another, I ran on 3 cylinders until  I found a garage and then helped the mechanic work on it, scavenging   parts from an old Beetle behind the garage.<p><i>I</i> happen to be pretty happy with my automobile situation, but would I recommend Joe Commuter do it to save $$ on the up-front purchase of an automobile? Never. I think it'd be insulting. It's overwhelming for the problem, and therefore doesn't <i>really</i> advance anything. It doesn't help Joe Commuter. Like when people discuss the cost of food and you suggest ""Here's $40 worth of seeds. With this you've got vegetables for a year -- get to work.""<p>That said, again, I think we're appreciating the same things.",1368208511

NoSQL has frequently been touted as this magic concept that makes databases scale well. It doesn't as many of the poorly scaling NoSQL databases on the market today show you. The most you can say is that it maybe lets you ignore a few particularly hard to scale operations. However there's also no reason that a NoSQL database can't scale well it's just that you have to actually design it in such a way that it does and Mongo failed at this.<p>Joins are a very useful feature of structured databases but there's no reason you can't have them in a NoSQL database. I speak from experience here, RethinkDB has joins (distributed joins no less). They're just as useful in a NoSQL world as they are in a SQL world.<p>I think the author's analogy ""NoSQL : SQL :: Dynamic Typing : Static Typing"" (to use SAT syntax) is a good one. I know some damn good programmers who prefer dynamically typed languages like LISP and I know some damn good ones who prefer statically typed languages like Haskell and I think programmers can be similarly productive with either a NoSQL or a SQL databases backing them up. Currently NoSQL has the very real downside that none of the NoSQL databases on the market have really nailed it (ours included but we're working on it) whereas there are some very well established and well tested SQL databases on the market so it's a perfectly rational choice to say you prefer the better tested SQL route. However I contend there's nothing inherently flawed about the NoSQL concept.",1368207895

Probably way too many, especially since it's mostly weird device drivers, which means I don't have a lot of people stopping by to help because the learning curve is kinda steep. This means I tend to have things bitrot as I move on to new and different hardware.<p>The problem is, hardware never dies, it just gets discontinued, its ebay price rises, and the people using it get more and more zealoty as the ranks of users are pared down to those who REALLY require whatever hardware it is. So any time I release a driver, I expect to get email from that point until the end of time. Which sucks, 'cause I have serious project ADD and get bored quick.<p>Here's two things I've come up with to help the situation in what little ways I can.<p>I've started releasing all software I think might require further community maintenance under an organization instead of my personal account. For instance, I've got a bunch of health device drivers that I wrote, many of which I don't care about anymore. Instead of letting them rot on my personal account, I opened an org for them (<a href=""http://github.com/openyou"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/openyou</a>). This means I can still have a part on the projects, as well as fork back to my personal account to keep pull request workflows going, but if community wants to come along and work on it, I just add them to the org, give them the perms, and we're good. Having the projects on the org makes things look a bit more ""open"" then just having it sit on my personal account.<p>I'm also trying to live in all parts of the cycle. This means if I find a project that's gone quiet that I still use (and I can't get ahold of the author, or if I can, get the authors permission, which hasn't been a problem thus far), I'll create an org, fork to the org, find people in the issues lists that have things that haven't been resolved, and reach out to see if I can get a community group started for new maintenance.

Yes, it is hard to refactor a live product and move it from MongoDB to MySQL / Postgre but was done before and you only do that if you get traction, so its a good problem to have.<p>I would start with MongoDB, get a grip on what on earth the product is doing, finalize the schema on the fly based on A/B tests, customer feedback and analytics, only once the schema is finalized move it to a SQL database if needed.<p>If you are not using a good ORM + DB migration system, then MongoDB will make perfect sense when you are quickly iterating through ideas and trying to find a product / market match.

5687487,comment,5684773,5684773,6,0,ebbv,,,"I've dealt with depression as long as I can remember, even when I was a little kid. I feel like I have only gotten pretty good at dealing with it as an adult. Here's my approach which may or may not work for anyone else:<p>1) I recognize that depression, self pity and all that are a waste of time and ultimately stupid. It's not hard to keep in mind that rationally I have it really good. This alone doesn't fix anything but for me it's important to not fall into the romanticism of depression as if it's deep and meaningful or ""more real"" than being happy. It isn't. It's bullshit.<p>2) I realize that these feelings are just a phase, and that I will get through them and the best thing for me is to ""ride them out."" I look at them like the emotional equivalent of spraining my ankle or something like that. A non-fatal injury which will heal and get better. The best thing to do is to let it heal and do what I can to aid that process.<p>3) I help myself get through the depression by focusing on things I enjoy. I try to make arrangements to hang out with friends or family who I enjoy being around. I listen to music that helps me when I'm feeling shitty (in my case this is usually metal or industrial music.) I seek out other entertainment I enjoy; comedy, video games, etc.<p>4) Foremost in my mind I keep the fact that there is no afterlife. If I do something stupid like suicide, there's just nothing. But if I stick through whatever I'm going through, I can experience more things that make me happy. I can see my nieces and nephew grow up. I can have some cookies. etc.<p>Best of luck to anyone else who has this issue. Find what works for you and do it. Stick around. Life can be great and there's nothing else.",1368206688

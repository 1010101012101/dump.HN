7491649,comment,7488554,7490655,6,0,Too,,,"The mathematical notation also lacks a lot of type information. Looking at his example formula, First of all, both x and N are magic variable names, where did they come from? Second, what happens if x is a string  and + is considered string concatenation. Mathematical notation has all the problems of duck typing and even more. In a way that&#x27;s also the beauty of math, you can multiply matrices with same rules you learned scalar multiplication in 2nd grade. For quick problems where you can keep all variables in your head this is nice to save on typing, but for larger applications you need clearly defined interfaces and a way to encode them.",1396076194

This is in no way comprehensive, but rather just to help you get unblocked, and that, age has less to do with creative ideas, than you are making it.<p>1. Industries that disrespect their customers. Say, you had a bad service/sales rep experience. Then you tried to switch, but found out that every other large competitor to this one is as bad. Probably the reason why there are so many banking/financial services upstarts in the last couple of years.<p>Caveat - usually these businesses are good at building high switching costs into their products. How many times have you thought of ditching your bank, but have never got around to it?<p>2. Fat and thin margins. If everyone is enjoying a fat margin, they are most likely colluding in their industry, and have some kind of (in)formal association barring anyone else to entry with lower price. Can you legally go against that trade association. Technology helps in leap frogging in these situations. Thin margin businesses (usually) indicate that all the efficiency that there is to be extracted has been. This can still be disrupted, if your tech can find new ways of doing things.<p>Finally, take a look at this - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_trade"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_trade</a><p>Fedric Tudor started the whole ice industry by cutting pieces of lake in the north and shipping them to south.

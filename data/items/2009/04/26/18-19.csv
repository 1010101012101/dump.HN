580273,comment,580209,580209,0,0,3pt14159,,,"I was home schooled for grade 2 and 3 and private schooled the rest. Throughout that whole period my best years of learning were grades 11 and 12.<p>The reason for this was that during all other private school years I was forced to sit and trod through material that was far too easy. I never did the homework because I could still pull of 70s and didn't see the value in having a higher grade. I was invited to province wide math contests, but was only scoring 72% in math. Finally my math teacher in grade 11 asked me how this could be. (He also happened to be the vice principal) I told him clearly: I hate class and I hate homework. They are not challenging, so I refuse to put effort into them.<p>He suggested the exact same thing that article advocated. The change was immediate. By grade 12 I was scoring 97 in calculus, 95 in linear algebra and 92 in finite math. All because I could move at my own pace. When I had exhausted the course material my teacher gave me books like Aristotle's mathematical proofs. These changed my life.<p>Imagine if this type of freedom had been available my whole life. My parents tried when I was young (via homeschooling) but my social development suffered too much and I wasn't getting the passion for the subjects that teachers can impart.<p>If I were to raise children now I would insist on a school that used the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori</a> style. It might not be the best for everyone, but for even slightly gifted children I think it will drastically improve their mental growth.",1240772262

580269,comment,580235,580235,0,0,Tangurena,,,"I disagree. My boss' idea of ""succeed"" is not the same as my idea. And I don't particularly believe that my boss' idea of success is good for the company in the long run either. My boss wants to look good to his bosses.<p>As another example of why I claim you're wrong, let me give an example of a company I worked at for far too long. It was a small family run business that sold and serviced automobile radios. At that time, car manufacturers contracted that service out to hundreds of smaller repair shops. This was one of them.<p>As part of their service program, a dealership could call up and request a radio to take care of a customer's problem. The radio would get shipped, the customer would get a call from the dealership to come by and swap it out. This way, there would be no hole in the dash, as most drivers would go insane if they didn't have some sort of radio (or CD or cassette) playing in their car. At least one dealership figured out how to game the system this company used (we figured that they ordered the top of the line radios to use as upgrades for the sales department). Consequently, they were stealing more than $1k/month of product from the company. Mostly it was due to crappy paperwork that ended up in a filing cabinet, never to be seen again. I came up with a simple VB/Access application that used a barcode reader and a barcode printer. I also made the mistake of using my own money to buy a PDA with built-in barcode reader (specifically, a Symbol SPT1500) and writing an app to track paperwork for the employees.<p>The boss hated it because his wife hated it. She hated it because it would make her have to do things slightly differently. Furthermore, the boss also hated it because it showed a flaw in his business system, and he treated it as if it were a bad mark on himself: he looked bad, therefore he was a bad person (that was his psychological take on the matter).<p>Between bad customers (the service department at that dealer wasn't the only crooked one), bad employees (at least one went into business for himself filling his garage with inventory before quitting), and a bad workflow system, he was losing between $50k and $150k per year that I could figure out.<p>Anything that involves more than 1 human will involve politics. And academia isn't any better or worse than any other business when it comes to the stupid nonsense that humans do to each other.",1240772050

But I think the economics of attention is exactly why aggregation services do provide value.

Sure there are bad ones, but there are extremely clever ones, too. It takes work make a rule that presents a story cluster, or karma, and just because they aren't creating <i>content,</i> doesn't mean they are creative, or creating value.  They are creating filters, they are creating a picture of popularity (Hypem), they are creating a picture of relationships (techmeme).<p>If there's anything I'm hungry for, it's not more content sites, it's even more and better aggregator sites.

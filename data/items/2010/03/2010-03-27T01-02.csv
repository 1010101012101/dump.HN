1222435,comment,1221598,1221598,0,0,freshfunk,,,"NoSQL vs RDBMS is really a proxy war for Denormalized vs Normalized storage.<p>You can take a system like Cassandra and treat data very much in a normalized way which would reduce performance. You can take a system like MySQL and completely denormalize your data which would increase performance.<p>Any test where one set of data is normalized and one isn't is not a fair test.<p>Also, denormalization can be a big deal. Unless you have some sophisticated code managing it for you, you're trading performance for data storage management complexity. Now you have to manage many instances of data X. But there is a benefit in that you avoid crazy joins.<p>I think both have concepts to learn from each other. For example, in order to use a NoSQL option effectively, you end up implementing your own concept of indexes, something very easily done for you in RDBMSes.",1269654787

1222423,comment,1221374,1221374,0,0,boskone,,,"I've stated in the past the _only_ thing wrong with PLT Scheme was not enough marketing.<p>PLT Racket is as evolved beyond standard Scheme as modern man from Australopithecus.<p>So many rich areas of study are available for exploration.  Just some of the capabilities, not toy, but full robust capabilities, include:<p>- Lazy
 - Functional
 - Reactive
 - OO
 - Macros (powerful, hygenic)
 - Delimited continuations
 - Module system (dynamic)<p>Not too mention the basics, eye opening approaches to XML and Web, an IDE, debugger, contracts, typed/dynamic language, jit, Android development, ... and on and on.<p>The talent of the core PLT group is outstanding.  Matthias Felleisen for example was awarded an ACM Fellowship in 2006 for contributions to programming languages and development environments.  His academic publications are right up there with the best out there, yet he spends as much time focused on the foundational aspects of teaching kids, and students as high brow papers, and the real world demands of programming.   And the rest the core are not too shabby either.<p>IMHO, there are currently only 2 top tier active hotspots where the cool theoretical meets with the practical and usable in programming language theory, the Haskell and PLT ecospheres.<p>Scala, and Closure would be next.<p>Don't listen to the wingnuts comedy central wannabe's cracking poor puns here about schemes and rackets (well laugh at the good ones).<p>In all seriousness, if you are at that point where you've stumbled onto the fact that there is a whole world beyond Java, Cobol, C and C++ and are having fun exploring Smalltalk, SML, OCaml, Haskell, Scala, Closure et al, do not skip, repeat, do not skip exploring PLT Racket.

I think most of us and most US citizens would agree with the government doing that.<p>I think the point is that they don't know what information is being stolen and how deeply they have been penetrated, and this scares them. What is released to the public is not as relevant as what information wikileaks actually has. Why should they trust wikileaks not to sell that information to other nations?

1222415,comment,1222096,1222206,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I suspect that Hacker News has a bit of selection bias, in that most of the people here are driven, success-oriented individuals who'd like to believe that hard work makes a difference.  We've already read all the articles about how success comes from diligence and practice, and that feats that seem superhuman are just the result of focused effort over time.<p>In my personal experience, the majority of people do not think like this.  When I was going through grade school, my parents/teachers/etc. often did use words like ""awe-inspiring achievements"", even for fairly mundane things like getting perfect scores on standardized tests.  I got into Amherst through a process very much like the article describes (I had terrible grades but had worked at an all-teenage dot-com startup and aced my standardized tests).  In the ""brag session"" where the director of admissions lists all the awe-inspiring resumes of the incoming freshman class, she said ""And one of the students passed 8 AP tests without taking a single AP class"", and a murmur of appreciation passed along the crowd.  Really, it's not that hard, you read a book and then you pay $75 for a test - but most of them don't know that.<p>I think it's great that there's more understanding going around of what achievement <i>actually</i> stems from.  But that understanding certainly isn't universal, and in the meantime, you can hack people's perceptions of you by playing to the blind spots in their own knowledge.  ""Everything is impossible until I know how to do it, and then it's trivial.""",1269653589

But getting that setup nicely with anything ""set top box""-like has been hard.<p>In my opinion though, this type of episodes on demand, no schedule required, watch when you want thing is the future of TV.  It is funny that most people now have PVRs (and swear by them) but really those things are just caching content already saved and available in cable company head-ends.  I am surprised there hasn't been more movement by cable companies to allow end users to watch their content libraries whenever and however they want.

Employee referrals<p>Obviously, Stack Overflow is based on building a community and now they are trying to leverage that community to generate money from matching companies with developers.<p>In his post, Joel states that ""[t]he average great software developer will apply for, total, maybe, four jobs in their entire career.""  Paraphrasing the next two paragraphs, he asserts that the truly great (as opposed to average great) developers ""...show up on the open job market once..."".<p>Maybe I'm jaded, but I cannot think of a single truly great developer that got hired through the standard recruitment methods.

The only reason it is remotely high paying is that you get locked into a vendor (Microstrategy, Cognos, etc) and have to use consultants with those specific skills.<p>It's a hard field to break into because people are <i>very</i> hung up on specific tools, eg ""oh, you haven't used Informatics PowerCenter 29.4.3 for 6.4 years along with Cognos Magic Report Web Engine 79.63.3 for 9 years?  sorry . . .

Specifically on a project that was pulling data together from server monitoring (eg resource load), web app use ( hits on each web app deployed by the company), and cost info from the accounting teams.<p>There were two big goals - use some simple predictive models to understand resource (server) capacity needs in the future and to tie cost per user per app back to revenues generated per user.  Amazingly - to me at least - this wasn't being done at any but the grossest levels.<p>Nothing deep there from an analytics perspective at all.  I'm not ignoring that a few companies are doing crazy stuff with huge data warehouses, but most (even very big) companies aren't anywhere close to needing petabyte data analysis.<p>What is more challenging for most companies is building the capability to do the simple reports.  This often involves delicate negotiations with groups reluctant to let you even have the data to build the report - it is a turf thing, eg ""No, all financial cost reports come from us"" or ""oh, that's highly sensitive accounting info and can't be shared.""

In my personal experience, having good professors, and smart hard working students in a class with me makes all the difference in terms of how much I learn.  While its true, just because a professor or student is at a university doesn't mean he/she is good (just like community college doesn't automatically equal bad) a university (particularly a good university), because of its admissions policies and hiring practices is going to weed out a lot of the bad.  A community college will weed out hardly anyone.

In other words, they will form their entity themselves, use some online kit to do as simple a setup as possible, and ignore the IP issues altogether, which means that whatever IP they had developed prior to formation, or that they continue to develop even after formation, will continue to belong to them individually or to other third parties such as contractors, and will not belong to the company.<p>This is usually a harmless error in that it can later be corrected once it is discovered, but only if all the founders (and other third parties such as contractors) are cooperative about it. If they are not, this situation can lead to serious problems, especially if the problems are first unearthed during due diligence in the course of a funding or acquisition.<p>The article mentions this problem in summing up the most frequent mistakes in this area and otherwise has intelligent insights and observations throughout.",1260457678

987918,comment,987497,987497,0,0,wglb,,,"I am sure there is a need there, but I am always wary of vendors looking to define fields of study.  One extreme example was a school not far from here that included CICS courses in their computer science (or did they call it information science) curriculum.  The problem with vendors (IBM, MS, Sun, Oracle) is that their idea of a workforce is not necessarily one that questions the underlying technology or career definition.  Correct implementation of floating point does not owe its genesis, but to thinkers like Knuth and Dijkstra who loudly pointed out the obvious deficiencies.<p>And as is pointed out here in the thread, the vendor's motivation might be to lower the cost of analytic talent.  And wholesale renters of programming talent are fine with this too--no enterprise is looking for programmers to tell them that ""you are doing it wrong"".<p>Does anyone remember the advertising for COBOL, that it was nice and english like and that now your accountants would be able to do your programming and you wouldn't need to deal with those pesky goofy programmers?<p>Or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CA-Telon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CA-Telon</a>.

By a factor of thousands.<p>It's like burning someone's house down with their family inside because they dented your bumper without leaving a note. But as you point out, few individuals were all <i>that</i> nasty - the culpability is distributed across a large, anonymous mob, with a few critical nodes, such as those persons who leaked the individual's contact information, or made prank phone calls to her work place.<p>The crowd / mob dynamics gives massive strength to the anonymous group that is absolutely unmatched by the individual. Mob dynamics in physical space are understood well enough, and police have had various means of dealing with large groups of disorganized people in town squares and so forth. This is not the case for internet-distributed mobs, which are still relatively new.<p>The process is like leaderless, decentralized, crowdsourcing of cruelty (cf. ""Anonymous: because none of us is as cruel as all of us""). And of course, the greater the crowd, the greater the possibility of someone recognizing the individual victim - which is exactly what happened in this case. Once this happens, with a name and identifying characteristics, the positive feedback loop and mob excitement can escalate and boil over.<p>You may already have seen this video about a thought experiment about the potential power of distributed, internet-powered mobs and the way things could go wrong <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyMdOT8YJgY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyMdOT8YJgY</a>",1347417849

Especially in areas like Colorado where land is cheap and regulation is light, building nice big cheap (in terms of construction costs)  single family homes sounds pretty good, vs. building expensive (per square foot of usable space) high-rise condos.  Construction costs are lower, and you end up with a bunch more living space, a garage, etc, etc.  And from a buyer's perspective, you have a lot more control over a single family home.<p>And yeah; you can have public transit in the 'burbs?  but it's not going to be popular.  Because you have so much more living space than a city dweller, you are likely to get more utility out of the hauling capacity of a car.  And having that extra living space also dramatically lowers the cost of owning the car;   You don't have to pay for parking, and you can do basic work in the garage.   (you can save a giant wad of cash doing basic stuff like swapping rotors yourself.)<p>Personally, I think the economic realities of the suburbs mean that only the poorest of the poor are going to not own personal vehicles;  because of this, public transit is built for and associated with the poor in all but the most built-up parts of America.  ""Domestic help"" is not fashionable here, either, so for the middle class, there isn't a lot of upside to letting poor people into their neighbourhoods.

(Gmail might come close if it didn't apparently use onclick instead of ontouchstart, and custom scrolling instead of -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch, for no discernible reason.)<p>It's not just that JavaScript is slow, although that doesn't help - having to worry about the performance implications of using libraries rather than directly using browser APIs, or being forced to use native scrolling because JavaScript scrolling just can't avoid lag, is a waste of time.  It's also that where native UI frameworks are designed for performance from the start - every single UITableView is drawn lazily (implementing ""immediate-mode"" infinite scrolling on top of the deferred mode DOM is awful), you can fluidly move between low-level and high-level drawing APIs (Canvas is a very sharp boundary), animation feels built in rather than a recent hack (and I hope you're not targeting anything other than WebKit) - in HTML you have to fight against an absurd layout system to do anything and, in some sense, work around it to do anything fast; there are usually many ways to do it but most of them are slow.<p>And it doesn't help that where native frameworks have built-in controls to do a lot of things - and those controls look and feel native simply because they have the home field advantage of being what everything else has to mimic - HTML5 is left with a bunch of shitty webapp frameworks and the option of reimplementing everything yourself. The creators of those frameworks seem to assume things like if the animation looks vaguely like the original, there's no need to actually get the details right to avoid uncanny valley, or make it performant at all, so you probably want to make it yourself.  I hope you know what you're doing.<p>As much as I love HTML5,  you have to fight every step of the way to make something that works right.

When my sister, who would otherwise be in front of a computer at most half an hour a day, can get an android smartphone for 150 euros and idly browse the Web all day, Google makes a shitload of money they wouldn't have if all these people were on cheap nokias.",1347415327

I was recently in Toronto and was surprised to find that it has a solid startup scene.  I'd never heard that about the city, I'd just assumed it was full of back-office banking jobs for techies like me.  I met some potential partners there and if/when something clicks, I'll still enjoy zero rights to be colocated with a Toronto-based team. There's the possibility of getting TN status I suppose but that's intended for employees, not founders.",1347415248

As an example, if it is using traditional natural language parsing techniques, then it should know whether there are less than ten syntax trees or less than one thousand syntax trees by ring-in time. In this case, the former can be determined with a much higher degree of confidence. Even short phrases can have a multitude of possibilities, the canonical example being, 'Time flies like an arrow.' Of course, I have no idea how they're actually approaching this problem, but the point is, heuristics can be used in the process of question-answering to indicate enough of a confidence level for ring-in.",1240851497

Unfortunately, however, equity is one of those places where you have to assert yourself and potentially be a temporary asshole to get what you want. You should have asserted yourself and your claim from the beginning (I.e., ""this is my company, here's what you could get if you joined""), but it seems you've missed that opportunity. I'm actually surprised you have allowed this to drag on for such a long period of time -- take care of it immediately. The only ""rule"" is to do whatever you can get away with that leaves you with the greatest share while keeping others happy.

Using your example, this works fine:<p>e.innerHTML = ""Hello & world, here's some HTML <span>Some html</span>"";<p>I believe the intent of the original author was to point out that basic DOM manipulation methods like appendChild, removeChild, etc are slower than innerHTML, which in almost all cases, is true.  Whether it's worth doing so is another matter.<p>If you have a fairly complex document, inserting multiple children can slow things down quite a bit as the browser has to reflow the document between each insert/append. Bulking them up in an array of strings, joining them, and inserting them into an innerHTML makes the reflow happen only once.   The document fragment approach can help a lot over multiple appends/inserts, but it has some tradeoffs too as far as performance.<p>Duly noted about user provided data though being a security risk.",1240850599

We've all had teachers like that.<p>Amen to that.  Not only is teaching a craft, I think it's a passion.<p>I took College Physics I with such teacher.  Physics I was one of the toughest courses in my college. According to the student polls, 70% voted it as THE toughest course.  Anyway, this professor was different (there're other professors teaching the same course).  He didn't mind going unconventional way.  For example, he claimed that he was the only person in the country who teaches force first then motion later rather than the other way around. (In fact, he refuses to teach the other way around.)  The great thing about him was he provokes students' curiosity and appreciation to the subject.   During the first day lecture, he concluded it with an experiment he claimed to be the greatest experiment ever performed on earth.  He just threw a chalk up into the air and caught it back, and that was it.  Then he asked why didn't the chalk ""fall behind"" for the earth was spinning and moving at many kilometers per second. 
He not only knows his stuff, he has a passion to teach, cares the students learn.  In many ways he has a hacker attitude.  I admit there'were students who hated him because he was tough on grades, and he didn't mind shushing those students who just took up most of the time with a lot of irrelevant, stupid questions. (He'd be patient at first, though.)<p>Back to the topic, I think unschooling might as well work for many people, but at the risk of not meeting such great teachers.",1240850526

They even predate the statehood and are embedded in the state constitutions.<p>Effectively, once you turn a pipe on, you can never turn it off. People who have ""senior water rights"" are allowed under those state laws to make people ""upstream"" not only stop using water from rivers, but replace the water that they had been using.<p>Canada has a large number of rivers that flow north into the Arctic sea. From the US perspective, that water is wasted. ""We"" would like to see it pumped south. However, we wanted a uniform framework of laws governing that.

Blogging seems to work best when it's used with Twitter as a conversation medium, rather than just a place to post stuff without listening to what people have to say.<p>Zappos is big now, but they weren't always big, and I don't have any reason to not believe their CEO when he says that Twitter has been a big part of their success.<p>The Nike example was weak, I agree.  But the Rubbermaid thing is a good example of using social media...just because they hosted those reviews on their site doesn't mean that it's not social media.<p>Here's another example that he missed: Yelp.  In areas where Yelp membership is high, it has a big influence on local businesses.<p>I agree that some of the sites you listed probably don't have a big impact on the bottom line, but to write off social media entirely because some of the social media sites are time-wasters with no ROI is a mistake.",1240848283

This is about mutual respect - I don’t agree with you, but respect your feelings.""<p>It's too bad the author doesn't take the women's rights approach, as that may be more easy to argue. The 'you offend me' or 'you hurt my feelings' card is extremely weak, especially in an opinionated, anti-conventional (or so it sees itself) community such as the ruby/rails crowd. In all honesty, if you refrain from this because 'someone may get offended', then where do you stop? Do you edit out all the cursing? there's lots of that in the Rails community. Do you speak only strictly in formal language? Present only in suits? I'm sure I can find people who think absence of any of these is problematic. But so what? There will always be someone who is offended.<p>And then comes the Buddhism analogy. Yes, I will take my shoes off when I enter the temple, because I am an outsider. But maybe a buddhist insider has the expreience, influence and respect to innovate in terms of Buddhist tradition, where I would be considered sacrilegious. To make things more difficult, 'proffesionalism' is derrived from 'professional'. It's simply a function of what most professionals do. That's why you don't call them 'professionalists', followers of 'professionalism'. I doubt the author can find a definition of professional that has anything to do with presentation style. Apparently, these ruby/rails/couchdb professionals make presentations like this. If that were unacceptable, then how would the professional presentation of someone from the Adult industry look like? Blured-out product images?<p>I'm not necessarily taking a stand on the topic itself, as I said, there may be better ways to argue.

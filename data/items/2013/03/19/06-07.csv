It wouldn't have helped Auernheimer (2 count indictment: 'Conspiracy to Access a Computer without Authorization', and 'Fraud in Connection with Personal Information').<p>Scanning this EXCLUSION verbiage, it's hard to imagine cases where there are ""efforts to gain unauthorized access"" but it's an act that ""solely involve[s] violations of consumer terms of service"", and yet still does not ""otherwise constitute unauthorized access"". It's almost self-contradictory, with that last 'otherwise' clause ruling most things back in. Law enforcement can allege in 'good faith', during the CISPA information-sharing that happens before court proceedings, that almost any anomalous traffic pattern is (or is working up towards) ""unauthorized access"". So send the feds all the suspicious maybe-cybersecurity-crime logs, it's the low-risk path.<p>I suppose this exclusion might theoretically help someone who maybe used 'curl' to access a website when the 'consumer terms of service' said only a desktop browser is allowed. But then if this curl-user went so far as to change the User-Agent to do this? That's now Computer/Wire Fraud  to circumvent the technical (<i>not</i> ToS) access protections. So send the feds all the related logs, just to be safe.<p>Similarly, say a user tampers with cookies to exceed a technically-enforced (but unmentioned in the ToS) 10-article-quota. That seems to still ""otherwise constitute unauthorized access"" beyond any ToS violation. So send the feds all the related logs, it's only prudent.<p>This isn't a very reassuring 'EXCLUSION'.",1363676142

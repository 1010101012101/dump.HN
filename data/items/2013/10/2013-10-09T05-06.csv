</code></pre>
Of course, there are situations where partial application won&#x27;t always happen because the compiler is unable to detect it:<p><pre><code>    (fn add (x y)
      (+ x y))

    (map #add [1 2 3])
</code></pre>
Pharen won&#x27;t be able to realize that `add` here is being partially applied inside `map`. It&#x27;s not smart enough for that yet. If you try to run this you&#x27;ll end up with &#x27;Missing argument 2&#x27; and &#x27;Undefined variable: y&#x27; all over the place.<p>However, I&#x27;m not putting a whole lot of emphasis on partials. They&#x27;re there as a convenience, but they&#x27;re not really a core part of the language.<p>But yes, back to the original point, all the tracking is done at compile time so that for addition with two or more arguments the resulting PHP will look like regular addition in PHP.",1381297753

One of the candidates told us how his hobby of skydiving let him see the big picture and another told us that his desi background would enabled to come up culture specific features for software services. I probed this question further, and he said that in India showing your muscles was considered hubris, while in America it made you look strong.

The primary determinant of whether or not a company gets hired is its ability to navigate the procurement process - not their ability to actually do the job.  In fact, many companies specialize in winning government contracts and then subcontract the work out to others.<p>It&#x27;s a sad, broken system that will almost certainly never change - in part because we don&#x27;t vote for the people in charge of these things.  It really doesn&#x27;t matter who is in the White House or in control of Congress. The fiefdoms within the government that control these issues have maintained a culture of mediocrity for decades, and it will likely remain that way.",1381295250

Campaigns don&#x27;t have many cross cutting concerns: the goal is to get a candidate elected. Sure, some high powered consultants are simultaneously angling for a new job after, but IT and most staff are relatively immune from that. Your job is to get something done, and you want to get somethng done. Government, though, has no such incentives: you can do shitty work and not face consequences, and the mission is inherently less aspirational and more shoveling shit. Much of the time government bureaucracies also double as a social welfare program, or a private welfare program if a well-connected corporation has a well-placed surrogate legislator or bureaucrat.<p>*Reality, needless to say, can turn out a bit different.",1381294913

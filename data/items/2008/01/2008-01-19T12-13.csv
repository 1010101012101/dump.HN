Traditional software companies can do this by pre-selling licenses at a discount and web companies looking for ways to get more users may pay you if you find a way to help your users get signed up with them.  However I'd caution against spending too much time on this sort of thing yourself as it can easily become a distraction.",1200747263
100861,comment,100459,100605,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"Clearly the MBA is not a good development machine, you want as much screen as possible for that.  I have a MBP 17"" with the HD screen as my primary machine.  I am very happy with it (and I've been through a lot of laptops starting way back with DOS based laptops, through all the Windows variants and with a Linux detour).   MBP + VMWare is a perfect combination for me.  Dual cores are really nice (have recently been doing some stuff on forgery detection in images, which I'll open source soon, and I can tie up an entire core doing image processing and not notice the difference).",1200745969

100858,comment,100175,100482,0,0,jpbf,,,"You said: As bayareaguy noted: ""You have to read the original article very closely or you'll miss their point: in terms of distributed database research, MapReduce is a step backwards.""<p>This to me is really funny since I don't think you can view MapReduce as distributed database research. I haven't used it, and while I admit that I might have gotten it all wrong, to me its a library/dsl/paradigm/technique for parallelization of certain data-processing tasks. So to me that statement makes as much sense as ""lisp, viewed as a monitor , is a step backward compared to lcds"".<p>Others, that I consider smart, have noticed <a href=""http://bitworking.org/news/288/Stonebraker-on-MapReduce"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitworking.org/news/288/Stonebraker-on-MapReduce</a><p>Also, while it was a while since i viewed the techtalk on bigtable, and I really agree BigTable is a column-based DBMS, I can't seem to remember that they built it to get around deficiencies in MapReduce, I understood it as a compliment. BUT it might have been much more constructive if, as someone said higher up, they wrote the original article about BigTable, because I do believe that their criticism is actually valid (as in apples vs apples) in some cases regarding BigTable.",1200744882

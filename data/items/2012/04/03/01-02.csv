The quality of engagement I get at G+ is leagues higher than Facebook. A lot of the people I interact with on G+ are engineers, programmers, artists, designers, scientists, and other ""knowledge workers"", whereas while I've tried to grow out my Facebook network, it appears to be mentally challenged. Hey, a lot of users I know on G+ <i>have deleted their Facebook accounts and aren't coming back.</i><p>Now, that's a personal data point, and by no means a scientific poll. But it's clear to me that Google+ is very much here to stay. Even if you only look at the design and UI side of it, G+ is considerably more advanced than Facebook.

Employment law is one of the most murky and sensitive areas of the law, and I'm convinced that the only reason there aren't more lawsuits is that most people simply don't know their rights.<p>Let me cite a specific example. I once sat in on a lecture by a former attorney-turned successful media entrepreneur who owned a fairly successful magazine. During a routine interview for an art director position, one of her staff members who was conducting the interview noticed that the candidate was wearing a Yarmulke. She said something to the effect of ""During certain seasonal spikes, we have a huge increase in workload that can extend into the weekends. I see that you're Jewish, and I am too. Do you think working on weekends is something you can do?""<p>The interview concluded, and they exchanged goodbyes. The interviewer expressed interest but asked the candidate to send over some work samples, but the samples never came. Instead, after a few weeks a letter arrived from the candidate's attorney informing the magazine that they were being sued. They settled out of court for nearly $50,000.<p>That seems pretty egregious and the woman was pretty naive to bring up such a sensitive matter in an interview, but I don't see how it's any worse than demanding to see somebody's protected Facebook account.",1333416297

There is a tamper-resistant chip in the iPhone which contains that code, as well as device-specific passcodes (e.g. the 4-digit unlock passcode), in the Keystore API.<p>Prior to the above devices, there was a way to plug the phone into a host computer and image the memory (even while locked), then brute-force the unlock passcode (often a 4 digit numeric).  The brute force still requires the physical phone, but the ""10 tries and delete device"" protection doesn't apply, because you've already imaged it.  ElcomSoft among others make software to do this (it's about $1k).  You can do about 5-15 attempts per second, so 10k search space goes fast.<p>After the iPad 2, that was fixed -- the only way to attack the phone is to brute force the passcode on the device itself, and the ""10 tries and erase"" protection DOES apply.<p>There may still be a backdoor (such as a way to disable the ""10 tries and erase"" function), or an implementation flaw.<p>The only way I know of to recover the passcode technically is to attack the secure processor, which I think is a FIPS 140-2 level 2 thing.  Maybe $3k per device, and physically destructive to the phone.<p>I would kill for a FIPS 140-2 level 3 phone (hardware and software protection), or at least something which protected Keystore to that level (or higher).

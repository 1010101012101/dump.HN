Yes, if you want to pick it apart, it was funny <i>because</i> it was a verbatim reference to the earlier article, but it was funny nonetheless.<p>Likewise, it was funny that the ""Funny..."" comment was modded to -1.  At least, I found it funny.  Point being, I don't think these were rewards for groupthink, so much as rewards for geeks being clever.",1203202674

117182,comment,117118,117166,0,0,dfranke,,,"<i>your (possibly accidental) assertion that what premises people believe affects what statements about reality are true</i><p>None of the statements in question have to do with reality, only with abstract ideas.  Libertarians believe that property ownership is a right; communists believe that it is an offense.  Neither of these assertions is empirically testable.<p>If the debate is about what policies will make us wealthier rather than what policies are ethical, then that's a different matter.  But in that case, both sides are sharing the common framework of utilitarianism.",1203202644

You can go and look at the old comments and stories and see what the site used to be like.

117180,comment,117118,117147,0,0,mynameishere,,,"<i>I think news.yc has a 5th troll behavior and it's down modding a comment because they disagree with it</i><p>That's not a troll behavior (""troll"" comes from the fishing term), and it's much less common here than on reddit or digg or (god help you) dailykos, where intelligent but unfashionable opinions get sunk hard.<p>There are only a few fashionable subjects around here (the importance of lisp, for example), whereas on other sites almost every question has a boilerplate answer, against which all opposition is ""trolling"". At any rate, no amount of actual ""trolling"" is as bad as groupthink. I'd rather a whole parliament of disagreeable colicky horseradish farmers than one unipartisan politburo.<p>ADDENDUM: Just thought I'd tack this on. Near the top of digg right now is this:<p><a href=""http://digg.com/business_finance/What_1_Million_Buys_In_Homes_Across_The_U_S_3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://digg.com/business_finance/What_1_Million_Buys_In_Home...</a><p>That's sort of an interesting subject, but look at the comments. At the top with 9 diggs:<p><i>I dugg the story, but I refuse to click on anything with Forbes magazine. They force a full-screen ad (that you can skip) but in my efforts to help stop obnoxious advertising, I boycott Forbes.</i><p>Okay, there you have a 15-year-old combining 1) his irrational dislike of full-page ads (perhaps he thinks Forbes survives on government grants), with 2) his irrational proclivity to upmod things without looking at them, with 3) his belief that Forbes cares whether a 15-year-old looks at its slideshows. This sort of sad lameness is actually what kills online discussions, not ""trolling"".",1203202580

Repeat with me: correlation does not imply causation</i><p>Correlation does not imply causation -- but correlation can still be useful for making predictions or decisions.  The fact that the word ""V!@gra"" appears in an email doesn't <i>cause</i> the email to be spam, but it does provide a strong indication that it's probably not worth reading said email.<p>If (taking a wildly hypothetical example) it turned out that 50% of YC applicants were over age 30 but 0% of the <i>accepted</i> YC applicants were over age 30, it would a strong indication to potential applicants over age 30 that they needn't bother applying -- and this is true whether the YC management has a deliberate bias against over-30s or not.",1203202053

Obviously the uparrows aren't only for applauding politeness, so it seems reasonable that the downarrows aren't only for booing rudeness.<p>It only becomes abuse when people resort to karma bombing: downvoting a lot of comments by one user without reading them in order to subtract maximum karma.

But there seems to be some proportion of the audience that feels vindicated in their views just because the opposite view was downmodded. Downmodding does not make opposing positions less legitimate.<p>These people seem to be different than the ones who write replies.

Two libertarians who adopt the same premises can have a meaningful debate with each other.  They'll agree that there can only be one consistent position -- so if they disagree on what it is then one of them must be mistaken -- and set about trying to figure out which of them holds the fallacy.  But if you pit a libertarian with the premise of self-ownership against a communist with the premise of ""property is theft"", nobody is going to accomplish anything because neither will view the other's argument as relevant.",1203199382

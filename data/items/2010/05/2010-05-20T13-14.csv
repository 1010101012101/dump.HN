1364015,comment,1363393,1363440,0,0,sordidarray,,,"Godel's Incompleteness Theorems are probably some of--if not the most---misunderstood concepts in all of mathematics (rivaling Cantor's Uncountability Theorem).<p>While the usual analogy for the first theorem is drawn to the liar's paradox (""This is a false statement.""), it's important to remember that it is only an analogy. The first theorem states, in layman's terms, that we can construct a valid <i>mathematical</i> statement which is complete and utter nonsense. (Much like ""This is a false statement."" is neither true nor false, but nonsensical.)<p>The second incompleteness theorem simply states (again, in layman's terms) that the consistency (where we say something is consistent if it contains no contradictions) of certain systems cannot be shown from the rules of the system itself. (Or alternatively and more correctly, if you're able to show the consistency of these systems using their own rules, then they're inconsistent.)<p>That said, please remember that these are mathematical theorems and as such their ""applications"" to other areas such as metaphysics, even by their creator, are not rigorous or necessarily meaningful. They live where they belong: in the depths of mathematical logic, in the heart of mathematics.",1274363973

Recognising the <i>technical</i> features/limitations of the device, the kind of software that would be useful is obviously different to that of the iPad.<p>Your two reputation questions are good. How can Apple ensure that only I can install apps on my device and not others? I have some ideas, but as I'm not privy to the internals, I have no idea whether they are feasible or not. Perhaps an iTunes preference (plist-style would be fine, it doesn't have to be exposed in the interface) that allows unsigned applications to be added to the list of apps in iTunes?
As for (b), I have no idea. Looking at the reputation of the Mac and OS X, I don't think it's that big an issue, but I can see the difference in reputation usability-wise of the desktop versus the Cocoa Touch products. I attribute this to the difference in interaction paradigms and the hard work that Apple put in to polishing the UI, rather than the business/legal restrictions.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wireless_router_firmware_projects"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wireless_router_firmwar...</a>",1274362929

The one positive aspect I could see in it if sports people were experimenting with their health and others could benefit from what they learn. Ie the best diets, most efficient ways to train and so on. If they figure out how I can get by with 30 minutes of sport instead of 1 hour for the same effect on health, that is 30 minutes more that can be invested in startups and curing cancer.

The two are very different.<p>In Firefox's early days (as in Chrome's early days) most of our early adopters were ""power users"" who browsed a lot, dozens, maybe hundreds, or thousands of pages/sites a day. But today we have many more mainstream users than early adopter power users. Regular folks don't browse that much. A good family friend of mine, for example, spends about 20 minutes a day on the Web checking email and reading a story or two in a major online news site.

This shall work by passing the text of the input document to a hierarchy of pattern matchers, looking for and extracting certain values and their relations. Next comes a function that takes these values and relations and knows how to distribute these data to the appropriate subfunctions, each of which computes and returns a substring; the parent then puts the substrings in the right order, formating them for the return.<p>I'm looking for a name for this concept, and wondered whether ""reduce-map"" would be a good one - maybe I could say that I reduce the document to a function, which returns a map (the formated string).

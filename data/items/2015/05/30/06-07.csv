Like literature, wine is subjective, so what you may find entertaining or good today, may change tomorrow. That&#x27;s why when you really like wine, you should try to keep an open mind and keep tasting everything you can.<p>The wine industry in the states is super stalled, and there&#x27;s  almost nothing interesting and fresh going on here, at least it&#x27;s been like that since the 2000&#x27;s. There are a lot of factors in play, but the biggest one is the price of land which makes it harder for smaller and better producers (vignerons) to actually farm their grapes.<p>The small guys, end up buying grapes and trying to find guys who are farming properly, etc etc. Which is super hard here. In California, dry farming is almost non-existent... pesticides are the rule, and high yields the norm.<p>There are other regions around the world that are pretty stalled too. Bordeaux is one of those regions, super predictable, super standardized and most of the time boring. At least that&#x27;s the case if you&#x27;re looking to drink a statement or the &#x27;work&#x27; of a true Vigneron.<p>&#x27;Cheap and Good&#x27; wine in California can be found in the 15 range... but I&#x27;ve found that most of the smaller producers find it hard to produce surprising stuff for less than 20-25. Where in France/Italy, a similar quality could be achieved on a 10-15 Euros Bottle.<p>Bottom line, drink good wine.

All are tasty and thirst quenching!<p>If you are fascinated by wine as art, though, you are going to be looking for something /interesting/-- unique and handcrafted.  And those qualities always cost money, because you are paying for somebody&#x27;s effort and talent.  If you love good cooking, for example, you don&#x27;t eat instant ramen every night.  You go out to have fun and see what the most inventive chefs are doing.<p>Bare Bottle is a startup trying to bring this creative aspect to the fore, by pairing great winemakers and designers (<a href=""http://barebottle.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://barebottle.com</a>).  Both artists involved are &quot;great&quot; because they are creative originals who make something unique, not merely because they produce something acceptable to wash down your ramen.<p>Disclosure: I am a co-founder of Bare Bottle.",1432966092

Since the withdrawal, Israel is the occupying power _around_ Gaza as it controls all access to the Gaza - by land, sea and air.<p>While i&#x27;m completely pro-Israel, in the sense that i fully support right of Jewish people for their state (where it is now, whatever way it happened, it has already happened), i can&#x27;t understand while the same standard - the right for their own state - isn&#x27;t applied to Palestinians, nor by Israel (themselves being huge beneficiary of such a right) nor by the rest of the world. Palestinians&#x27; hate toward Israel can&#x27;t be a valid reason to deny their own state to Palestinians as for example nobody denies the right of statehood to Iran who officially hates Israel, nor such right was denied to Egypt back when Egypt waged a war against Israel.",1432966092

Most of my time spent at tasting rooms consists of mentally rolling my eyes at the conversations I&#x27;m overhearing. So, as a self-identified wine skeptic who just really happens to like wine, I&#x27;ve gotta admit: there is a <i>huge</i> difference between a good $15-$18 bottle of wine and a good $5-$7 bottle of wine. To me. My spouse and I have even played &quot;guess the bottle&quot; in this price range, and believe me it&#x27;s not as hard as you&#x27;d think. My tastes have, annoyingly, elevated over the years--annoying because $18 nightly bottles are out my budget. It&#x27;s as though I crossed some sort of wine rubicon. I would agree with the point you are making at a higher price range, but mere mortals really can appreciate spending an extra $10 on a cheap bottle of wine, I claim. I&#x27;ll say one thing though--the author is spot on about how much cheaper good wine is in Europe. Trying to buy wine at a Carrefour in Valencia last summer, we searched high and low for anything in our &quot;splurge range&quot; (~15 euros) before realizing that maybe the fact that 90% of the shelf was priced at a third that was trying to tell us something.",1432966057

However, those contributions are key to those other systems working at all.<p>For example, the typical bullet rotates at ~200,000RPM. This is about 3,000 revolutions a second, or about 300 microseconds a revolution. Figuring a larger projectile could only rotate about a tenth of the rate, we get about 3 milliseconds per rotation on a shell.<p>At 3 seconds per revolution, I suspect that we&#x27;re inside of the timing windows that talking about the efficiency of energy absorption and dissipation in the coating that the laser is striking is relevant, and we can begin to talk about the laser energy being dissipated over more than a single fixed point.<p>However, I suspect that such tactics (as high velocity spinning) can only mitigate the effects of the lasers and not stop them in isolation. It needs to be tied together with a coherent plan to dissipate the energy that areas do absorb and scatter the beam&#x27;s focus using ablated coating.<p>In terms of energy absorption rates, energy dissipation rates, and ablative properties, picking the right coating for your mortars trying to pierce laser defenses is essential.<p>tl;dr: It&#x27;s a synergy thing, since the low-absorption coating reduces the demands on screwing up their targeting, and screwing up their targeting reduces the demand on a protective coating.",1432965977

Mostly because they are paying interest and many don&#x27;t or can&#x27;t invest in the market which sees offsetting gains when the value of currency goes down.<p>Short answer: when you print money, borrowers and non investors lose money, while lenders and investors gain more. It creates more imbalance.<p>Printing money does not get to consumers to spend, the 90% we are talking about, not the upper class which already knows how to make money when more money is being printed.<p>Our economy is heavily consumer focused, there aren&#x27;t enough wealthy people to spend needed amounts to account for the whole populace/economy. Wealth by nature is hoarding/saving and only investing for returns.<p>If you look at it like a distributed system, giving money to lower class to improve the economy is to bittorrent/distributed decentralization where giving money to banks and the wealthy only is more like a centralized single point of failure that leaves many out.<p>When you do a stimulus for the lower 90% you will have guaranteed spend and increased buying from all areas of the economy, when you do a stimulus for banks and wealthy you only fund endpoints (wealth centers/investment/loans) throughout that have too much demand on each endpoint. The lower will spend at any time, even in down turns, the wealthy only spend in booms or extreme busts due to the nature of investing. If we looked at stimulus more like a distributed system, we might be better off.<p>Side note: The Iraq war cost for instance 1.7 trillion and will go up to 6 trillion:<p><i>The U.S. war in Iraq has cost $1.7 trillion with an additional $490 billion in benefits owed to war veterans, expenses that could grow to more than $6 trillion over the next four decades counting interest, a study released on Thursday said</i> [1]<p>There is 1.2 trillion in student debt.  What was a better purchase? Iraq war or paying off student loans here that will turn into a huge lower end stimulus? It isn&#x27;t just an offset either, the country has 1.2 trillion in student loan debt and upwards of 6 trillion in Iraq only war debt.  So really we have 7-8 trillion in debt out there between just those two things, because we aren&#x27;t making good choices.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/14/us-iraq-war-anniversary-idUSBRE92D0PG20130314"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/14/us-iraq-war-annive...</a>",1432965928

And I do have a social life -- less active than many, but more active than a lot of people. I even read books, actual physical things made of paper, in my spare time.<p>How do I do this? I think maybe I instinctively understand that my personal information processing abilities are limited. I know I'm not a computer; I don't try to be like one. First of all, I subscribe or commit to relatively little, and of what I do follow, I don't feel any obligation to read everything. Mailing lists are aggressively filtered, even when I read them I'm culling entire threads left and right. Facebook I avoid unless I want to keep up with invitations and so on. Quora was starting to become a bit addicting, so I've curtailed that.<p>Am I abnormal? Do the rest of you just... let the machine take from you what it will? Why? Is there some ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED: I READ THE INTERNET that I'm unaware of?<p>P.S. I'll admit that I failed rather badly a company where everyone was expected to read hundreds if not thousands of mail items daily. But I still blame that not on the fact that I didn't read EVERYTHING, but that I didn't prioritize effectively.<p>P.P.S.

Git in particular will commit with an empty commit message but is not thrilled about it, and I think there are other VCSes that are more anal about that, thus the need for <i>some</i> text was expressed and ""whatever was going on for me while I wrote it"" in particular was desired.<p>So yes, it is completely irrelevant for most purposes to you.  I suppose it might be nice to run some sort of semantic analysis that notes that someone writes depressing drippy love poems when it's raining out or something, but I'll be damned if I can figure out why the hell that would be important for me at all.

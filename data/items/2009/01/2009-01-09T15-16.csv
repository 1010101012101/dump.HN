Canada was at 7 or 8% for many years, France is often around 10%.<p>Also, I remember reading an article that talked about the vast number of people who are excluded from the American data. People in prisons for example - 2 million people. There are also people who do not file unemployment claims or are ineligible to do so because of much higher restrictions in the US compared to more liberal societies. Therefore, US unemployment figures are always about 2% too low, but it is one of these 'psychological' stimulus the government gives. If our unemployment rate is near 0, then economy must be doing great!<p>Please correct me if I am wrong.",1231516501

426683,comment,421542,422721,0,0,mhartl,,,"N.B.  Regarding trade deficits: if Alice from A wants to buy something from Bob in B, she typically pays for it with money.  The source of that money is either production (your option #1) or debt (option #3).  (Option #2 is just past production, since people usually buy real estate with money.)  In either case Alice's purchase increases the A's trade deficit with B.  But it's totally beside the point that Bob lives in B.  Indeed, the analysis is identical if A = Atlanta and B = Boston.<p>There's a rough correlation between trade deficits and debt, just as there's a correlation between the number of movies people see and debt: there's a correlation between <i>spending</i> and debt.  Focusing on foreign trade---and using the loaded and misleading word <i>deficit</i>---simply feeds people's xenophobia and distracts from the underlying issues.",1231516096

426660,comment,425789,426010,0,0,time_management,,,"Correct. Starting a company is fun, but it's not a time in which you can do research. Research is inherently risky and long-view oriented. Because startups are inherently risky and must survive in the short-term, the added risk of structuring a company around a research project is likely to lead to so much risk that no one will want to fund it.<p>Well-funded government labs can do R&D because they're in a low-risk position and can take the long view. A government researcher is going to keep his job regardless of whether his findings contribute to the immediate P&L, so he's able to pursue research projects that are unlikely to pay off in the short term.<p>Contrary to the common slight against government regarding innovation, government research projects can be highly innovative and useful. As for CEOs claiming that R&D departments are less innovative than private-sector executives, well... they're CEOs, so of course they're going to be immensely biased in favor of their own kind. Their definition of innovation is based on what they recognize as innovation, so of course most of them will underappreciate the long-term-oriented contributions of R&D.<p>The problem with academia, though, is that it has the worst of both worlds. It's bureaucratic and stuffy, moreso than most government research labs, but the level of risk (career death) for the aspiring professor is intolerably high, meaning that high-risk research projects are unpalatable. Academia's a sinking ship, and no longer a viable career for more than a handful of people per year. I hate to say it, but academia's best days are almost three decades behind it, by this point.",1231515012

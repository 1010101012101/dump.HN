I would've used it for my project had it been available when I started, but I had to build most of the features you listed in house (we pull about 80K feeds). One feature that might be interesting to add is returning the results in json format since that's easier to parse now that most modern languages have that built it.

644559,comment,644372,644481,0,0,timr,,,"<i>""I don't see how these are going to just disappear if GM is gone. There are other car companies these suppliers can sell to.""</i><p>That's your opinion, but the facts are pretty clearly against you.  Listen to the radio and read the newspaper -- the suppliers are already failing.  And they're not failing because there's no demand for <i>cars</i> (GM sold about 9 million cars last year, incidentally), but because their primary customer has stopped paying the bills.  That's what the government is trying to save -- not to mention the numerous American towns that have no economy without the local GM plant.<p>And before you argue that bailing out these towns is the wrong solution, try to remember that the world doesn't turn on a dime.   Yes, a place like Youngstown, Ohio probably needs to find a way to survive without the GM plant.  But they aren't going to diversify their economy overnight, and it isn't going to help them to let their primary employer die.<p>So maybe you're right, and some non-zero number of these suppliers would survive a total GM liquidation.  I don't know.  The point is, the bailout isn't designed to save GM, so much as it's designed to save the entire economy that <i>surrounds</i> GM.  Everyone who tries to make the calculation in terms of a cost-per-GM-head is being simple, and is failing to consider the larger picture.",1244269198

644555,comment,643891,643891,0,0,chmike,,,"I don't agree with the author of the article when he writes that we don't need another search engine. We definitely need alternative search engines here because the quasi total control and monopole on the information funnelled to nearly all internet users is a very serious problem. This is too much power in the hands of one player. In addition to the incredible amount of knowledge it has on everyones searches and thus interests and works, it is in a position that would make it possible to totally bias and corrupt the perception a user can have on knowledge published on the web.<p>There is also room for improvement in the ""experience"" provided by google.<p>But I fully agree with the authors on the evaluation on the Bing stuff. My experience of bing, by comparing search results on the scientific topic I'm working on, where disappointing. Microsoft results appeared to be highly biased toward particular scientific institutions which, I have heard, have some research partnerships with Microsoft.<p>An advertisement campaign may catch attention, but it won't change the experience perception.

644552,comment,644433,644526,0,0,gchpaco,,,"\u20ac specifies a code point, not an encoding.  (specifically the code point 000020AC).  The encoding of wchar_t in C89 is up to the implementor, and in particular GCC uses UCS4 on most platforms.  But this is besides the point; C99 and C++ both require that any C language processor that runs across that sequence of characters to <i>immediately</i> interpret it as the Unicode character €, or rather to behave as if it did.  So you can have function names like ""b\u00EAte"" if you were for some reason incapable of typing ê.<p>What setting the locale to UTF-8 does is require (well, for very weak definitions of require; the standard is pretty damned quiet on anything other than C or POSIX locales) that the Unicode character sequence in question be output in the UTF-8 encoding.  Presumably you could define a locale en_US.UTF-16 that output in UTF-16, although I would point and laugh if you did.<p>In sum: C89 doesn't say a damn thing of any use about wide chars; just that they exist and here's some convenient functions (and that only in TR1).  C99 requires that you be able to specify characters using Unicode code points in wide character strings but otherwise does not specify input or output.  The locales, which are standardized only by convention, talk about encoding from a well specified (usually) disk format to whatever the library's internal representation is.",1244268907

Search engines or any service that lets users upload or link content is prone to cease and desist letters.

I/O almost always requires transcoding, except in the unlikely event that the destination encoding happens to match the chosen language's in-memory encoding.<p>If you create a wide-char string (C++'s most obvious candidate for full Unicode-level support), and print it out to the console using wcout, the programmer should reasonably expect the library to perform transcoding as necessary to match the destination (providing things are configured correctly).<p>The fact that \u20ac maps to a code point in UCS2 or UTF-16 when encoding a wide string in text format for the compiler to read, is all but irrelevant.

I&#x27;m reminded of this talk by Sussman.[1]  Essentially, in software we are (understandably) adamant about not modifying the input of our application for &quot;pure&quot; functions.  Nature goes right the opposite, often attempting to make the input work at all costs.<p>So, whereas a schema based application that models a user with an address is unable to cope with being given two addresses.  A schema-less approach where it just stores blobs simply stores what it was given.  If code that reads this is unable to make sense of multiple addresses, it will raise an error.  Not necessarily unlike a user being told to send a package to an address, but given a list of addresses.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/We-Really-Dont-Know-How-To-Compute"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/We-Really-Dont-Know-How-T...</a>",1373043231

(The chest X-ray, in turn, was follow-up to a course of preventive treatment for tuberculosis, medically indicated for a foreign person who arrived in the United States Mantoux-positive for tuberculosis, perhaps from having had the BCG tuberculosis vaccine overseas. The X-ray finding was nothing at all like the chest X-ray of someone with a tuberculosis infection, but quite unusual, prompting many other diagnostic tests, including repeated biopsies.)<p>The good news is that the patient I know recovered fully after surgery. The bad news is that the patient had to have major surgery. Moreover, we are unsure to this day what the actual diagnosis was. The surgery was curative, as the patient&#x27;s complaints and disabilities all went away after it was over, but the lung infection was never definitively diagnosed. (Another infectious agent was cultured after a different biopsy.) Slow-growing lung infections are very hard to diagnose. Fortunately, most people have a lot of spare lung tissue, so even removal of a whole lobe on one lung does not impair future aerobic exercise.<p>Developing better diagnostic procedures for this illness will not be easy at all, but seems well worth doing. Antifungal drugs are very hard to develop, because fungi are very biologically similar to animals, and thus a drug that works on fungi has a high probability of being toxic to human patients if taken internally.<p><a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/valley-fever/DS00695/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/valley-fever/DS00695/DSECTI...</a>",1373041795

However, it is known thanks to an approved declassified statement that on at least one occasion, the NSA did violate the 4th Amendment[1]. This is taken from the legal director of Senator Ron Wyden as part of an official statement:<p>&quot;It is also true that on at least one occasion the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court held that some collection carried out pursuant to section 702 minimization procedures used by the government was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.&quot;[2]<p>Again, no one is saying that the government isn&#x27;t claiming legal authority. But what you--we--need to understand and accept is that no matter what actions the government takes, <i>they will always claim legal authority</i>. If they were to take unconstitutional or otherwise illegal actions against U.S. citizens--even with benevolent intent (e.g. protection and safety)--they must claim the legal authority to do so. The problem at hand is that neither the actions taken <i>nor the legal justification of those actions</i> are known to the general public and thus we have absolutely no avenue to check the government and ensure that their claims of legal authority are accurate.<p>It&#x27;s important to now note that by definition there is no enemy of any nation which presents a greater threat to the sovereignty of that nation than a corruption of that sovereignty itself--be it political corruption, abuse, or tyranny. Therefore, it is an a priori requirement to national security for the public to know that the actions and justifications of the government are legal--and that the public views their legality as justified.<p>And this can and should be done without releasing specific details which would result in an unreasonable threat to national security. We&#x27;re not talking about releasing the source code here; we&#x27;re talking about proving to the public that they approve of the both the actions and the justification of those actions. It may be inconvenient to be restrained by the constitution, but violation of it--even if only in spirit--is tyranny as the founders defined it.<p>Finally, as an aside to your point about aircraft carriers and missile defense shields, those examples are neither questionably unconstitutional <i>nor are they equivalent</i>. If a aircraft carrier or a missile defense shield become compromised, there will be destruction; but manageable, well-defined, destruction. We can measure and contain that sort of destruction. It&#x27;s impossible to imagine or measure the amount of destruction caused by the release of in-depth intelligence data of many, most, or all citizens of the world.",1373041526

But semantics are almost never a convincing argument (for most for programmers I know) for spending the time to pick up another language.<p>What really pushes people over the edge in my experience from thinking of Clojure as &quot;just another Lisp&quot; or a parentheses laden toy, are the amazing concurrency primitives that Clojure provides out of the box. Once my colleagues realize how trivial (and fun!) both concurrent and parallel computation becomes with Clojure, they&#x27;re hooked and want to dive in.<p>The talk you gave is probably the most concise manifesto I&#x27;ve yet to come across of just how much better Clojure&#x27;s semantics are for, well, pretty much any complex problem I can think of. You did an absolutely fantastic job with your assemblage of example functions which definitely shows off the language.<p>But I know that if I want to convince the company I work at to  adopt ClojureScript as a JS replacement for our client side applications, an argument for superior semantics is almost never going to get very far.<p>Clojure (in combination with libraries like Incanter, JVM interop, etc.) allows me to completely replace R & Python for both exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and building a powerful backend for any distributed application with a double whammy of awesome - I get a much better language for expressing a lot of ideas AND it&#x27;s fast as hell. I can scale my Clojure code to a cluster of CPUs for training some model without a second thought. I can write really powerful software and never feel limited in what I can accomplish and in the end, project managers/execs just can&#x27;t argue. Simply nothing else exists in this class with this combination of agility, functional elegance, and &quot;enterprise&quot; class power.<p>Okay, this comment began as a thank you for making a great appeal for ClojureScript and has unexpectedly turned into... I&#x27;m not even sure.<p>So, TLDR? We need a killer feature that goes beyond semantics for ClojureScript that fixes something broken and practical in JavaScript. Is this a seamless and powerful Web Workers VM or abstraction that just works? Is it a mature core.async in tandem with full featured promises? Is it a new core lib that makes having to think about client/server interaction a problem of the past? I just don&#x27;t know.",1373041488

Even the term &#x27;hikikomori&#x27; is a nice label to stick on something that nobody really understands, so we can get these nice mental health experts in who can give us a name for something and help the problem go away. The current attempts to understand this, and similar conditions, are in my view flawed, and counter-productive. Before Japan floods itself with mental health care to &#x27;fix the problem&#x27;, I think the mental health industry needs a major self-diagnosis first.<p>I see such conditions as a battle between individualism and collectivism. The collective wants us to adapt to the behaviors and emotions of everyone else, which may conflict with the individual desire to be ones self (And thus, alone: the only place where we can be ourselves). Society wants conformity and familiarity out of fear of the unknown, and as such, we are quick to reject individualism, stick a label on it, and attempt to generalize so we can feel like we&#x27;re back in control. The mental health industry is the embodiment of this collectivist mentality. It starts with a preconceived solution: that of &#x27;normal&#x27;, and infers the problems, giving names to conditions which lie outside of that considered normal.<p>If you consider that mental health conditions are never concretely defined: but instead a list of common symptoms is given a label based on statistical probability: you have the condition if 4 out of 6 of these symptoms apply, for example. The truth is this is all we understand - a very macroscopic view of behavior, emotion and chemical response from our bodies. Nobody really knows the fundamental constructs which define our behavior and feelings yet. The mental health industry doesn&#x27;t let that stop it though, and is so sure of itself that it can easily apply labels and it can &#x27;fix people&#x27;, based solely on past results (which aren&#x27;t that great). Ultimately, what defines whether or not an behavioral, emotional or chemical response is part of a condition is that of perspective: The perspective of those defining the labels based mostly on deviation from &#x27;normal human&#x27;.<p>If we contrast the collective against the individual though, we might come to different conclusions about which needs &#x27;treatment&#x27;. The collective favors false values like patriotism, piety and loyalty over actual moral values. It&#x27;s greedy. The collective says one thing and does another. It&#x27;s a serial liar. It pillages and murders. By any definition of the word, the collective is psychopathic. Yet individually, we have moral values. It&#x27;s each of our fears that ultimately manifest into the collective, and the rejection of &#x27;non-conformists&#x27; is part of that.<p>That&#x27;s why we can have leaders, worshiped like gods, calling for the mass murder of innocent humans, and revered with medals of honor. At the other end of the spectrum, seemingly innocent young men and women who choose solitude, harming nobody but themselves and close relatives, are treated like the bane of society. They must be &#x27;fixed&#x27;!<p>Japan is traditionally a very conformist society, and the pressures of the collective on the individual to succeed are massive. It&#x27;s not surprising that at some point young people choose not to live for others anymore, but to be themselves - and living in the only place where they can be.<p>Before you diagnose yourself with depression or low self-esteem, first make sure that you are not, in fact, just surrounded by assholes. - W. Gibson<p>Also, lets not forget how often &#x27;mentally ill&#x27; has been used as a pretext for authoritative governments to lock away dissenters for expressing their individuality: alternative views outside those deemed acceptable by the collective.",1373041288

People <i>voluntarily</i> trust each other, deal with each other, live closer to people they like and further from people they dislike. They choose what to eat, whom to marry etc. Then, there is small group of self-proclaimed religious guys who self-identify with the whole society and <i>also</i> claim the right to use violence because of some mystical &quot;social contract&quot;. No one was signing this contract. And even if some dudes in 1787 signed some piece of paper, it has nothing to do with you or people around you. It&#x27;s just a belief in magical lines called &quot;borders&quot; that suddenly change the moral nature of a man.

There are some quite reasonably priced hosting out there, I hear Dreamhost name a lot in that respect, I myself use Bluehost, quite good and inexpensive.

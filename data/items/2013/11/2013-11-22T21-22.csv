What made turnable.fm awesome was that it was people like yourself deciding on what everyone wanted to listen; if people didn&#x27;t like the choices, someone else could be selected. Now that control is out of the equation. The artists are selecting what everyone wants to hear, they are choosing based on what they want you to hear. Don&#x27;t like the music? All you can do about it now is leave the room. Only time will tell if this is what brings turnable.fm into the spotlight, or sink it down into the depths.",1385157543

A 60W-equiv rated CFL is never as bright as a 60W incandescent, more like 40W when new.<p>* There are notable gaps in the spectrum causing color distortions. CFL light mostly features a greenish or violet shade and looks &quot;hollow&quot;. Tungsten and halogen are way better, even after 20 years of CFL development.<p>* Most, even the more expensive ones are not really instant-on.

If being committed to you means taking the better part of a day, weekend, etc. to exhaustively go through a &quot;code challenge&quot; for one job opportunity, that&#x27;s one thing. For the average job seeker, if you&#x27;ve got ten recruiters that you&#x27;re in contact with and one of those ten want you to dedicate that much time to their position and the other nine want to put you on the phone with an engineer and bring you on-site, how attractive is that one job? For someone already working more than full-time, probably not very.<p>I think the long and short of it is that being committed to a job has nothing to do with whether you&#x27;ll tolerate a code challenge.

I claim that there has been a backroom debate in the higher level Military Industrial Intelligence Complex (Top tier NSA, CIA, DoD, Pentagon, NSC) in which it was concluded that technology has created a potential for a single non-state entity to cause massive damage, and that &quot;Total Information Awareness&quot; is the only way to prevent it.<p>Of course, I disagree that the purpose of TIA is security, and I also disagree that it is even successful, but the real issue at hand is beyond that, and is about how the debate was had and who was involved. There was no public debate, and any that did leak was tightly brought under control (with NSL&#x27;s etc). This is an affront to the democratic process imho, but even if one were to argue that our representatives were involved, I would say there has been a stratification of the congresspeople, so that only a select few people on a select few committees even get to participate, and even then the ones who do are unable to grasp the subject matter fully. Of course no staffers get to see it either.<p>With the knowledge of how intel agencies work, and more specifically, the contact sport of politics in the beltway, I would also venture to say that even if a fairly principled rep did make it on a relevant committee, though would quickly be brought back under control via the standard methods.<p>I won&#x27;t get off too far into this rabbit hole, lest I am accused of conspiracy theory, but I truly think the system of checks and balances is not only crumbling, it is in ruins. Even worse, a facade is being put up to cover it up.",1385157383

The only reasonable way to double your money is to buy something that you can resell in the short term for a profit of 20% or more. Do that two-three times and your money is doubled.<p>Alternatively, invest in something where you can act to increase the value in the short term and recoup your investment in a few months. Similar to buy and sell but you only invest in part of an existing business.<p>Examples.\nBuying web businesses that are sad because the builder was cheap and hired an incompetent. You buy it cheap, fix all the problems and sell a shiny new bulletproof site to a promoter/marketing person who knows that they can use it to earn ongoing revenue. Idea guy botched the job by outsourcing, you the tech guy fix the tech problems (and maybe some design UI UX stuff) then sell to the sales/marketing business guy who has a long term plan.<p>Another example. A waitress quits her job and invests her savings at a grimy sad restaurant across town. She also takes a waitressing job at minimum wage there. Every night after closing time she cleans and decorates. And working in the daytime she wears flirty clothes, keeps up her best smile and cheerful manner. Word gets out and new customers come to see what&#x27;s happening. Business doubles and triples. After 4 months, the owner pays her back her investment plus 40% and gives her a regular job as manager/waitress at a normal wage. She works there for another year, keeps building the business and hires the right replacements. Then  on the basis of this transformation she gets a job as catering manager at a small regional motel chain and gets into renewing their restaurants. With the money she saves up, she quits after two years and buys a small restaurant. After a year she sells it for double what she paid and goes on to the next. People actually do this kind of thing.

The President has a huge amount of concentrated power within one branch of government, yet approximately half the time, the President of the day is effectively a lame duck with nothing to lose by behaving almost any way they like. Other parts of the government can make that President&#x27;s job harder, but short of impeachment everyone is basically stuck with whoever it is until their time is up.<p>I increasingly feel that giving the electorate an absolute power of recall if an elected representative angers enough people during their term would change politics for the better at almost any level. Otherwise, any term of office that is sufficient for reasonable medium- to long-term planning is also sufficient to allow serious damage to be done with relative impunity if the wrong person won the election but the voters only learn that after the fact.<p>As a side benefit, this also balances the tendency for major elections to be fought on a tiny number of headline issues, with little if any incentive to represent the electorate&#x27;s interests in all the other significant-but-not-dominant areas, because if you annoy too many small groups of the population, collectively they can become powerful enough to trigger a vote.",1385156645

Leaving the comfort of a spreadsheet’s visual display for R, maybe?&quot;\nTo make this statement would be ignoring that numerous non-free statistical packages have offered GUI front-ends for years. SAS/EG, JMP, Minitab, and SPSS instantly come to mind. Two out of those four are even marketed directly to people as statistical extensions of spreadsheets.

Statistical software costs an order of magnitude more than Excel, so they&#x27;d need pretty good arguments on how to sell upper management that the business team actually needed an 8000 dollar piece of software.<p>I&#x27;m not sold that there&#x27;s nothing in between Excel and R. From my experience, they require a slight learning curve (nowhere near the learning curve of going from Excel to R), but not an insurmountable one. What these solutions lack is the name recognition that Excel has, or decent integration into a MS Office stack (exceptions, of course--I remember seeing a statistics toolbox for Excel once), or they cost too much.<p>I think part of the real problem is that for a lot of companies, Excel is &quot;good enough&quot;. There&#x27;s plenty of stuff it can&#x27;t do well. It chokes on larger data sets, has limited statistical functionality, poor scripting capabilities, and shaky random number generators. But it&#x27;s good enough for people who don&#x27;t want to do much with their data.<p>If they wanted to do harder-core analysis, they&#x27;d outsource it to an analytics team.

In my opinion, this kind of &quot;critical&quot; thinking is not necessarily a positive: there are other ways to think critically that don&#x27;t map well to programming. This seems like the typical HN view that everyone should think like <i>I</i> do. Some people don&#x27;t get math, or symbolic logic, and that&#x27;s not stopping them being a value to society.<p>Looking at your profile, it seems like you have a horse in this race.

Once you mix your coins the value of a coin from your perspective becomes the average cost of a coin. So if you paid $1 for a coin and $100 for another coin, put both into something that made the distinction impossible, and then sold a coin for $150, you would have to pay taxes on $150 - ($100 + $1)/2 or $99.5 of income.<p>Note that turning into non-Bitcoin is the event, type of Bitcoin does not matter, but anything but a Bitcoin does.<p>2. Technically you would have an income on your gains of xxx-w%. I don&#x27;t know offhand if you could write off the expense, but I doubt it.<p>3. You are talking about bitcoins being bitcoins, so no taxable event. Whether it counts as an expense for writing off purposes is another point I don&#x27;t know. This would likely be a loss so could be deducted.<p>Your edit: Assuming you account for the value of the bitcoins gained at the time you gained them as income (which you should have) then you can consider that as the cost of the bitcoins. If you never counted the value of the bitcoins when you gained them then your cost basis is $0, so the entire value of the cash out is income.

6783854,comment,6780408,6781868,2,0,alanctgardner2,,,"> Engineers seem to have a certain predilection to talk over people<p>That&#x27;s overly general: a lot of programmers may be socially inept, but it&#x27;s neither necessary nor sufficient. Both the examples from above are pretty anti-social, but they also don&#x27;t happen to have these skills. Likewise, I know some very good programmers who are also good at requirements gathering and collecting domain knowledge, which entails learning from experts and listening to them.<p>> The tools we&#x27;ve created for computing are heavily dependent on symbolic logic.<p>The whole notion of computers, for better or worse, depends on symbolic logic. You&#x27;ll have a hell of a time building a microprocessor whose instruction set is paintings or dance moves. The best case is that we build an interface from symbolic logic to this new, more approachable paradigm.<p>>  They make amazing interactive art pieces.<p>How much logic can you put in an interactive art project? Can it model anything in the real world? The biggest problem with other paradigms is density: if you want to program via something other than symbolic logic, get ready for incredible fatigue as you try to turn a 10K LOC program into a 500MP painting. Or an 18 hour long dance.<p>I guess I should clarify: I don&#x27;t think non-programmers are lesser beings, or that they can&#x27;t model <i>anything</i> in their heads. But for the sake of programming, the only thing that matters is if you can model a computer. If you have other types of intelligence, that&#x27;s fine, just know you&#x27;re going to have a tough go of it when it comes to understanding the code you write.",1385155477

A candidate could have rent-a-coder-ed the project, refactored it a bit, and slapped their name on it.</i><p>Sure, if you ask no follow-up questions after the challenge is completed. However, with a few well-placed questions about the implementation and some inspection of the code, it&#x27;ll be quite clear whether you&#x27;re talking to the author or not.<p>We once gave a (non-web-dev) programming &quot;challenge&quot; (I thought it was a joke/insult given the candidate&#x27;s claimed experience) to a senior dev candidate. Mind you, this was on-site. I even tested it by putting our newly hired grad to the test and he aced it within 20 minutes. We gave the candidate an hour to complete it (and added a 30 minute extension when he was struggling).<p>The challenge involved developing something against an SDK (interacting with a camera) and we gave him internet access and the SDK examples to work off of. In the end, he produced something not quite what we were asking, but he was sure to claim it as his work. Although it wasn&#x27;t ideal, I was prepared to say that he &quot;passed&quot; the assignment, because he was <i>close</i> and I was sympathetic to factors of stress and nervousness.<p>As he was toured around the facility, I inspected the code and saw that he was completely passing off one of the SDK examples as his own work (diffs showed only two variable names had been changed). The reason his code didn&#x27;t quite do what we wanted, is that he wasn&#x27;t even able to tweak the SDK example to do what we asked. He was a complete fraud and never mind technical ability, we couldn&#x27;t have dishonesty like that on the team.<p>Before that interview I thought those kind of challenges were a joke, but after this I saw their value. Of course, their value depends highly on how their are implemented and targeted, but dismiss their usefulness at your own peril.",1385154769

From a hiring point of view the challenge should have some vague areas in the requirements in order to test whether the candidate is a coder or a developer who asks decent clarification questions. The challenge requires no special tools to do, either JS in a browser or Python or something like that. The exact requirments of the dev environment are specified at the time the appointment is made, i.e. if you want the person to develop in Python 2.6.3 or to use JS with backbone.js, then the candidate can get set up in a few minutes and be ready.<p>I consider 4 hours to be a max. 45 minutes is a bit short IMHO and does not allow for including unit tests.

First, write some use case scenarios/specs in order to get a better understanding of the problem (for libraries this is README.md, for user-facing programs its the user&#x27;s problem and the solution&#x27;s workflow)<p>2. Write the code the way you would ideally want it to work, top-down. Imagine that you&#x27;re in fantasy land. Don&#x27;t worry about it being wrong or impossible to do that way. That will be corrected later.<p>Use classes to express blueprints for tiny worker machines that work on data, not the data itself. Use classes to simulate entities.<p>A user is not the user&#x27;s personal information - thats a data structure. A user class makes sense in a testing framework where you want to simulate the process of a user visiting a website.<p>A button is a worker machine that can detect a set of inputs and call attached functions. A list is a worker machine that can keep items and update the screen based on its scroll position. A stream is a worker that can be customized to process incomming data packets in a certain way, and its output can be connected to another stream.<p>Think of classes as tiny single-purpose computers or simulators.<p>3. Express details about the desired outputs of that top-down code as tests.<p>4. This is a good time to write all the <i>data structures</i> to represent your data. You can use relational modeling here even if you&#x27;re not using a relational database (or any kind of database), but you can also use pointers/references instead of foreign keys.<p>Model the data structures for all data (including computed data), not just input or stored data.<p>You can also do this before step 2. but in that case you will be tempted to write your code to operate directly on the lowest level data structures, instead of making it look clean and simple.<p>5. Try to make the tests pass.<p>6. If its impossible to implement or you realize its not a good idea to implement it that way, tweak the test a bit then change your code and data structures as you get a better understanding of the problem.<p>7. Once you&#x27;re satisfied with the test, you can stop.<p>8. If the future of the program requires you to adapt it, keep working like that over the existing code. The tests give you some reasonable assurance that it still solves the old variant of the problem, while new tests will ensure that the code sanely solves newer problems too.",1385154318

If your intention was instead to build a program with a UI for playing around with the pieces, moving discs around willy-nilly and perhaps adding more rods, then Rod and Disc classes present themselves quite naturally.

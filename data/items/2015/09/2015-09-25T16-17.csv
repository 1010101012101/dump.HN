Does anybody still hope to get anywhere near the estimate when buying a new car, especially city mpg?<p>I would argue this sort of manipulation is done widely and was pretty well known and accepted but VW must have overdone it.

Keeping the EGR open has a lot of drawbacks and probably isn&#x27;t a viable long term solution as it results in loss of power in the engine, reduced fuel economy, greater wear on the engine, increased particulate emissions, increased overall operating temperatures.  The later drawback would probably require a hardware solution.<p>A diesel engine with an EGR operating doesn&#x27;t efficiently burn off all the fuel which, in addition to loss of power, produces greater particulate matter (pm) emissions which intern need to be filtered from the exhaust.  The exhaust filters can become clogged with pm soot and the way it&#x27;s cleansed is by injecting and igniting fuel in the exhaust to burn off the soot.  If the EGR was continuously in operation then this burn off process would happen with greater regularity increasing the operating temperature of the exhaust system which would probably require more heat shielding and cooling.<p>Another option is a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system.  Assuming one could be retro fit on these cars, an SCR would probably have the last impact on the vehicle&#x27;s operation but would introduce new maintenance concerns for the operator (DEF fluid) and Volkswagen.",1443199892

But Holman says they have &quot;failed miserably in getting anywhere near that goal.&quot;&quot;<p>As a former employee of an SBA favored, minority woman owned business, let me make something very clear:  The entire SBA small business process is itself gamed and owned by former employees (and their still employed buddies) of the big government contractors.<p>Case in point:  My particular &quot;start-up&quot; was &quot;owned&quot; by my COO&#x27;s wife.  She was CEO in name only, but had 51% ownership because she was of Fillipino descent, and therefore qualified as a minority-woman.  My COO was a white male who was truly the CEO.  His wife was a stay-at-home mom, but on the company&#x27;s pay roll.  Since the other SBA stipulation was that there was a maximum profit limit for the company, the COO and his other buddy both had their wives listed as employees to pay them each the maximium allowed salary of $300,000 a year.<p>Think that was ugly?  Then there was the other peace:<p>My company would bid on contracts, and when we won them, would simply sub out large portions of the work to the same giant defense contractors.  This is not the exception, but the norm.<p>It is a rigged system with numerous bureaucratic rules which are exploited by the people who know the rules best.

My points are:<p>1) Python 2.7 is still, 6 years later, much more popular than Python 3.x.<p>2) Python 3.x now has 5 versions, none of which has features which are strong enough to cause migration. Specifically, async is not as easy as the competition, type annotations are an itellectual indulgence if they don&#x27;t improve performance, and ease of use, a central pillar of the language&#x27;s attractiveness to newcomers, is being eroded with unnecessary moves towards &quot;seriousness&quot;.<p>3) It was a mistake by the Python authorities to break compatibilty without bringing <i>substantial</i> new features. Breaking compatibility allows revolutionary features. Instead we have breaking of compatibility with only incremental improvement.<p>4) Because the leadership refuses to acknowledge 1-3, its credibility is now questionable. It is an important related issue that people who point out these problems, as I do, face a strong barrage of criticism, with suspicions of orchestration.<p>5) With due respect for and gratitude to the inventors and contributors, the time for change has come. For Python to flourish, new leadership is needed.<p>I am happy to debate my strong opinions, but to suggest out of the blue that I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about is not interesting. I have been using Python for a decade. I know it very well. You may know it better, in which case I would like to hear your considered opinions on my points.

It&#x27;s also won&#x27;t go viral (it automates a boring bookkeeping task).

Basically, it&#x27;s barely even a commercial project, I&#x27;d be happy to just get users.<p>I decided then that organic search traffic is the way to go, but for that I need at least some links. My naive assumption was that highly-customized posting in appropriate niche forums was the way to go. I figured that since I am &quot;adding value to the Internet&quot; by making something free and useful, it would be well-received.<p>I was wrong.

But let&#x27;s face it, getting to ANY stadium on game day sucks when you&#x27;re sharing the experience with tens of thousands of people.<p>Only problem is that it&#x27;s a very specific use case and is likely only to have seasonal ridership. And any example that can be used to show why something can be built is one backfire away from being a reason not to do so.",1443199253

As noted above, I&#x27;m very individualistic, so I favor fair treatment of individual humans.<p><i>Appeals to authority and accomplishments aside, I don&#x27;t need to have written such systems to understand, infer, and conclude things about aspects of their behavior. My point is this: something created by humans cannot be, by definition, inhuman.</i><p>I don&#x27;t know what you mean by &quot;inhuman&quot;. It sounds like you mean the term to be &quot;never tainted by the ephemeral emanations of humanity&quot;. I merely mean &quot;inhuman&quot; as &quot;thought processes so radically different that intuitions about a human mind are completely useless&quot;.<p>Concretely, do you believe a random forest can somehow infer that the variable x[27] represents gender, and that to make it&#x27;s sexist creator happy it should reduce the objective function in order to screw some women over?

Deployment seems straight forward, much much simpler than what I had to do with a Rails app that I was experimenting with. Go deployment would be easier, but Elixir seems at worst to be inline with Play/Java (running under Play and not tomcat).

NASA’s budget projections reflect this (page PS-32 in their 2016 Request, for example). You can see NASA requesting about $20 million per year for New Horizons until 2018, at which point the requests promptly drop to $0.<p>This isn’t as scary as it looks. It merely reflects that, on paper, the New Horizons mission is only approved through the Pluto encounter, the time it takes to downlink all of the data, and the time it would take to close out the mission. Continued funding is approved every two years based on scientific proposals submitted to NASA and evaluated by an independent review panel. These are called extended missions, and nearly every science mission gets one, owing to the fact that not scuttling a spacecraft actively returning great science to save 0.01% of your budget is a stupidly easy case to make (for the most part).<p>So while the New Horizons team must make a scientifically sound argument for extended mission funding, it won’t be too hard to do. New Horizons was submitted to a NASA proposal for a “Pluto Kuiper Belt Mission.” The first planetary science Decadal Survey (which prioritizes the scientific goals in the solar system for the decade New Horizons was launched) recommended a mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt.

In the implementation, yes, is a poor optimization strategy, but for the user of the language, shouldn&#x27;t that be what appears to be happening? Mutable data structures and functional programming mix worse than immutable data structure and functional programming.<p>> Or placing stateful actions into the same API set as FP expressions makes little semantic sense and discourages any sense of thoughtful structure to the different paradigms.<p>This is incredibly weird. You <i>cannot</i> get an array in Swift with an item at an index removed. There is a function to remove an item at an index from a mutable array[1], but no way to remove an index and return a new array. You can&#x27;t do it. But you <i>can</i> &quot;filter(:)&quot;, which returns a new array, and you <i>can&#x27;t</i> &quot;filter(:)&quot; a mutable array to alter it. ...wat?<p>[1] - a thing that I&#x27;d argue shouldn&#x27;t exist, when we must have mutability, it should be mutable references to constant arrays",1443198126

Hint: SPI flash chips can be had from many places.<p>While it is still possible that some of the chips will have a back door, either the back door will be too hard to create a viable attack for, or users can verify the contents of their flash. (SPI flash chips are too simple to run their own cloaking algorithm.)<p>Users can take defensive measures if a widespread attack is detected. Defensive measures might include finding out which manufacturer produces vulnerable chips. By avoiding a flash chip &quot;monoculture&quot; it would apply the collective power of the internet to preventing a flash back door, thus making the write protect line an effective security measure.<p>[1] <a href=""http://libreboot.org/faq/#intelme"" rel=""nofollow"">http://libreboot.org/faq/#intelme</a>",1443197496

If two companies submit proposals in response to an RFP seeking to acquire 1,000 Widgets and Company A responds with a price of $10,000 while Company B responds with a price of $20,000, the government is required to chose Company A because they are cheaper.  However, if Company B is a small business/minority-owned business/service-disabled-veteran-owned-business/etc, the contracting officer can choose Company B <i>because</i> it fulfills other requirements to support those types of businesses.<p>I could see some small cases where the government would restrict the size of the company responding to an RFP, but there are also ways around that.  The small business can contact the contracting office and protest saying they were unfairly considered for that acquisition and usually will win.<p>The key to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) is that they try in earnest to support and encourage fairness when awarding contracts.

Or they edit a config file you placed in /etc/ and then they run the installer for a new version. Oh so now your &quot;simple&quot; installer has to handle version upgrades, and file conflicts?<p>If your software is literally so simple as files in /usr/bin and /etc, building packages to install those files should be <i>easier</i> than writing a <i>good</i> install script, because the package manager will handle so many use-cases for you out of the box.<p>> You will probably write a script to build your package, right?<p>No? I have a makefile which can do the actual building and installing. dh_make will generate a debian directory, and debuild will call this makefile. An RPM specfile also will have calls to make build, make install, etc.<p>None of this is <i>writing an installer</i> unless you consider a makefile having an &quot;install&quot; target &quot;writing an installer&quot;.<p>> The point is that you now have to do work for every distro you want to support
If the installation is as simple as you claim, the packages will be simple wrappers around the results of a makefile.<p>If its more complex, then packages are still easier to maintain, because you don&#x27;t need to worry about &quot;what distro am i on, and do i need to check what the apache binary is called, or what packages are installed by default&quot;.<p>> and all users without a package manager that you support is SOL.<p>If I haven&#x27;t covered some Distro, it&#x27;s hardly difficult to give them a .tar.gz containing the tree created by the aforementioned `make install`. This is <i>still</i> less work than your special installer script.",1443196991

The issue is purely in the small, inexpensive vehicles.<p>The NOx problems were mostly resolved through the injection of urea into exhaust gases (e.g. AdBlue), dramatically reducing NOx emissions while leaving the efficiency and power unaffected. Urea systems add an extra cost and complexity to the vehicle though (not to mention that you need to top up your urea additive occasionally), and VW seemed to find a loophole that allowed them to make small, inexpensive cars without urea injection. They did this by injecting fuel into the exhaust in the absence of Urea, but to achieve the same effect. But this can gunk up the NOx trap if used endlessly (it is far less precise than urea, obviously), reduces fuel economy, etc, so they built this One Little Trick that only actually does that during identified tests.",1443196853

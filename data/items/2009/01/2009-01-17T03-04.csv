437718,comment,340743,419032,0,0,FutureNerd,,,"I was thinking along eru's lines. The specifics I came up with:
1) Compress sorted lists by encoding the differences between successive numbers using a code that's shorter for smaller numbers.
2) Use in-memory merge sort.  That way you don't need random access to the lists, and it's overall O(n log n).
3) In order to merge large lists when memory is already almost full, divide the lists into blocks, allocate blocks for the merged list while you're deallocating blocks from the two source lists.
4) To do this in Python, use the ""array"" module.",1232164319

Considering the fact that he's 24 and running a place like FB, I think he's done a good job <i>all things considered</i>, but the award was for ""Best Startup CEO"" not ""Best Startup CEO who is still young so doesn't really know he is doing, but is doing pretty well in spite of his lack of experience.""<p>Because that would be way too long for Om Malik to say remotely coherently.<p>(P.S. I think I would make an <i>awful</i> CEO of FB, but I also think there are far more competent Startup CEOs out there than Zuckerberg, it just so happens he gets a ton of press, which means it makes sense that he would win an award that is determined by a mass of mouth-breathing, TC-reading publics. Sort of like how it makes sense the Twitter founders won ""Best Founders"" since, apparently, any press is good press, even press that constantly points out how incompetent you are.)",1232163565

It is probably the most widely used language for web apps right now.<p>Anyone who calls PHP a toy language is not skilled enough to write anything better than a toy in PHP.  It is not really a criticism, just an observation.  Until you become skilled enough in any language you are pretty much doing fancy versions of Hello World.  With many languages the skill of the programmer matters more.  For example, I am still struggling to understand why I would ever use functional language for anything but that is a) because I haven't needed it yet and b) I haven't taken the time to acquire the knowledge and skill needed to write anything more functional than toys.",1232163090

437698,comment,436575,436933,0,0,maximilian,,,"But does a naturopath actually give you some willow bark to chew on?  From my experience, it is just a plant derived active ingredient.  Kinda like the difference between ""Natural Flavors"" and ""Artificial Flavors"" in foods.  The active chemical is identical, but one comes from a plant, and one was derived in a lab.  In the end it doesn't matter too much because they both end up pretty much as identical  chemicals in a test tube.<p>I mostly know of ""naturopaths"" who are into the homeopathic ""mumbo jumbo"" so I'm surprised to find out that naturopathic schools attempt to follow the journals.<p>I kinda think that there are good ""doctors"" (be it traditional or not) who are up on their science and listen past the 30 seconds they meet you.  And then there are regular doctors who don't listen enough and misdiagnose on a regular basis and naturopaths who are into a lot of hand-wavy ""medicine"" that wouldn't hold much salt if properly tested, but because of the placebo effect find themselves still employed and even convinced of their skills.",1232162935

3019065,story,,,1,3,zackmorris,"Dare HN: Download/purchase True Blood without BitTorrent or subscribing to HBO",,"Hi I need your help.<p>I recently had my internet turned off because HBO told Qwest (soon to be CenturyLink) that I was sharing True Blood over BitTorrent.  With the burden of proof in their hands, I resolved the situation and as I am now on their watch list, I don't use BitTorrent.<p>Be that as it may, I feel a certain duty now to -not- subscribe to HBO, even though I would like to.  But I want to support the writers, directors and cast members of my favorite shows on HBO and other networks:<p>True Blood<p>Dexter<p>Mad Men<p>Big Love (girlfriend enjoys it ahem)<p>Californication<p>But for the life of me, I can't find a place to purchase current episodes of True Blood.  iTunes has last season.  I'm told I can go on IRC and just ask for them, but that seems so 1997.  If any of you know of a simple site where I can purchase episodes for download, I'd be grateful.<p>If not, maybe it's time for a web-based BitTorrent of some kind.  Off the top of my head, one could use the compression ratio of maximum URL length (roughly 2048 characters) to the SHA-1 length of 20 bytes or 40 hex characters, to store data in query variables.<p>Basically some kind of spider would go around reporting the SHA-1 of basically every URL in existence, and to upload a segment of a show, people would post a properly formatted request that causes data to hang around on sites like flickr or facebook, and then post the list of checksums somewhere where search engines will find it.<p>It might require a math function to swizzle the URL somehow, perhaps recording the difference between the actual URL and the desired URL in another query variable on the end.  It doesn't really matter how it works, just that mathematically the opportunity is there to store data that way.  The important thing is that file sharing would go back to being a download-only operation which would (ideally) free fans from the threat of disconnects and lawsuits.<p>Then as companies submit takedown requests for these URLs, other spiders would go around and make sure that the chunks are replicated on some number of other URLs, maybe on servers in other countries or in pictures or other persistent data.<p>This is all well beyond anything I could ever do, which is why I ask about it here.  To me, this is the inevitable future of the web.  As I like to say about my definition of inevitable, it's ""that which is harder to stop than to start.""<p>The endgame is an arms race between hackers and content providers, which mathematically the content providers can't win.  So that means there will probably be legislation of some kind, making the use of certain software or the download of certain material illegal, which will be the end of the free internet because they'll have to monitor you to enforce it.  Maybe this is already happening.<p>The flip side is that if content providers don't tone down their prosecution of their customers, they might piss off one hacker too many.  I kind of feel sorry for them, they just don't know who they are dealing with.<p>Well I guess that's it, am I off base or is this all destined to happen?",1316544956
3019064,comment,3018573,3018573,47,0,ctdonath,,,"Unified queue.<p>Regardless of media, business structure, delivery mechanism, company name, etc. methinks what all customers want is a single place to choose & queue content, filtered by whatever options they desire, delivered on whatever medium is available and they pay for via a spectrum of contracts (from unlimited-per-month to single order).<p>Just make sure it's all on one queue. If multi-queue, then only because one customer may be grouping for multiple individuals (ex.: husband wants ultraviolent scifi, wife wants sappy romances, kids want Elmo galore). Whatever you do, don't force the customer to spend time/effort along such artificial differences as media (ex.: I want the DVD of ""Scarface"", but it's not on streaming anymore and I don't want to pay extra for the BD version - let me pick those options based on my single content choice, don't make me search 2-3 different sites for the same title which, I notice, have unreliable availability).<p>Amazon faces the same issue: vast business differences between warehouses of books & other physical stuff shipped by mail, vs. server farms for Kindle, streaming video, cloud storage/processing, etc. - same problem as Netflix, yet they're doing well under one website. I can search for Moby's latest album, and when ready to order can with ease choose between CD, MP3, DVD, and instant video: same content pool, same checkout, easy delivery, user doesn't care how it all happened.",1316544954

I'm sure they'll be a huge success.<p>I'm not saying that I'm God's gift to college-dropout programmers, but I'd never had a problem succeeding in a job until this one. In reaction to this state of affairs I had considered that maybe I need to be at a huge company that has better processes, but your Google tale says maybe otherwise.<p></vent>",1316544309

We have beta support for mobile devices, so you can REPL from your Android or iPhone, though Ruby and Python are still not supported on iOS.<p>The code is open sourced under the MIT license and available from GitHub (<a href=""https://github.com/replit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/replit</a>).<p>All feedback greatly appreciated!",1316543470

Itanium, DEC Alpha, PowerPC, and MIPS in the past.  Of course those were targeted at professionals, not consumers.<p>* I don't think MS really cares that much about x86 native apps running on ARM.  They care about desktop managed apps running on ARM.  Why?  LOB apps.  LOB apps are managed and they want to support ARM tablet users having access to these.<p>* Related to the above point, there are actually few native x86 apps that really matter.  Look at the Amazon top 20 selling SW list.  It's basically: Office, Windows, Intuit, Adobe, and antivirus.  Microsoft ships half of the top 20.  They'll be shipping antivirus, so effectively shipping 2/3rd of the top 20.  The only apps in the top 20 they'd need to get are Intuit (Quickbooks/Quicken/TurboTax) and Adobe Premiere XYZ.  MS can probably have at launch 95% of the cycles consumed by native x86 apps on ARM.<p>With that said, for once, I do think Gruber is generally correct.",1316543296

Also what I see is, how much people are addicted to the NIH syndrome. They have a ways of working which they won't change, adapt or even agree debate for their own good.<p>The way I see, too much or too little process are both equally dangerous. The key is neither to over play nor under play the game. Too little management leads to wandering in the wild with no goals, plans, tracking and destination. Often overly delayed projects.<p>Too much management gets in the way of achieving what would have been even easily possible.<p>After all the analysis I can say, sure you may want to hire every smart guy on the market. But you must also know to manage them. Bunch them together, create a positive environment and enable them to be as much productive as they can be. Good people need to be taken care of, Senior developers/architects even though not managers need to have some people skills. Its simple, if interacting with people is a part of your job.. People skills become part of your job.<p>To be good alone is not sufficient, if you are good alone you can probably get a maximum of 9 hours worth of job done everyday. But if you can manage 10 such brilliant guys you can deliver 90 hours of such work every day. But that requires spotless planning, tracking, course correction and most important creating an environment where such people can be productive.<p>Nothing big in software these days can achieved without team work. If a person is not good with teams, may be its time for him to look somewhere else.

(And, perversely, I <i>want</i> this article to be true, because I loathe the patent system in its current incarnation and I think it is a serious problem for our society.) That aside, there were a few things from this that didn't make sense to me:<p>> <i>The theory is simple: a company's stock price represents the stock market's best estimation of the company's value.</i><p>This is contrary to all of the very little bit that I understand of the stock market. Investors attempt to find companies which are undervalued, and invest in them; by definition, that would mean that the market is not accurately estimating the company's value. A company's ""real value"", however you care to measure that, might be some kind of attractor in the market graph, but that's about the best I'd give it. Not that I know anything about this stuff.<p>> <i>If the company's stock drops by, say, two percent in the days after a lawsuit is filed, then the market thinks the lawsuit will cost the company two percent of its market capitalization.</i><p>I am more certain of four problems here. One, that companies can take a stock hit for a variety of reasons, all, some, or none of which may be related to a patent issue. Two, although I can't be arsed to find an example at the moment, I'd wager a fair amount that there have been no shortage of data points where a company's stock market value <i>rises</i>, or stays level, in correlation with a patent issue. Three, ""the market"" doesn't ""think"". The market is simply an abstract construct composed of a huge number of individuals following individual goals and algorithms. Anthropomorphisation of complex systems often leads to faulty conclusions -- like using those systems to evaluate the value of individual elements. And fourth, since we can't accurately tie the company's value to its stock price in the first place, then concluding that a two-percent loss of stock price represents a two-percent loss of the company's fortunes is erroneous.<p>> <i>But with a large sample of companies, these random factors should mostly cancel each other out...</i><p>And I am <i>very</i> certain that this is an error. Why ""should"" these random factors cancel out? Have there been any studies finding that they do, or are there any lemmas in statistics that supports this? Aren't the accumulation of errors in statistics usually represented as minima and maxima values, i.e., ""we think the value could be here, but it could be as low as there or as high as there...""?<p>I like the conclusions but I'm uncertain of the claims.",1316542322

Tactics include dodgy financialization, creative  accounting, ripping off customers at the cost of goodwill, mistreating employees then being screwed when talented staff abandon the company, outsourcing cost centers then getting hit by bait-and-switch prices (Chinese and Indian wages <i>will</i> rise), and so on.<p>People who are already rich benefit (due to good dividends, higher stock prices, and performance bonuses), but will lose in the long run (unless they get bailed out). Nobody complained when the rich were making money, because they though the benefits <i>would</i> trickle down; but now that a lot of the benefits have proved to be illusionary, people are pissed.<p>Name one person (not a left-wing nut-job) who bagged the Enron execs when everyone thought they were actually making money ;)<p>My point is, I don't see any good reason for relative difference between the rich and poor to change over time (past a certain point, say, what it was in the 60s). If it does, it might be because something is broken.",1316542234

You can take this as evidence that Google nefariously pulled a bait-and-switch and unconscientiously uses principles like 'open' only when it suits them financially. Or you can give them the benefit of the doubt and accept their explanation that the source code for Honeycomb wasn't ready for public consumption, and they had to make a pragmatic decision in the interest of maintaining their platform.<p>Besides that issue, it seems to me that RMS's gripes are largely to do not with Android but with the entire phone industry, and most of every other electronics industry.

While on the desktop it's annoying but not that much of a hassle to sign out and back in, it's terrible to having to do that on a phone - especially once you enable two factor authentication.<p>Before they ""fixed"" (note the quotes) the apps accounts so they can use (not quite) all of google's services, I could at least stay signed in with both accounts. Not any more.<p>This ended up with me having two browsers, one for plus, reader and all other google services I had much prior to creating the apps account and one for reading mail in gmail.<p>Yes. I could migrate to an Android phone. Been there. Done that. Multiple times. I really tried.

Now it’s shifted to how to get the processor closer to memory.” With Automata, however, he says Micron is bringing those lessons together but then asking, “What about the role of memory for doing some of the processing”? And herein lies the key. The memory becomes the compute.</i><p>This reminds me of all the memristor hype from a few years ago. Is there any overlap between the subjects?",1449575960

Exactly the reason why I can&#x27;t use most of the apps, even the high profile ones like the BBC News. They must understand that it&#x27;s not anywhere close to 99.99% of cases, that a good connection is available more like 10% of an active time, and, therefore, a great deal of caching and prefetching is mandatory. If most of the time most of the functionality of my mobile device is not available I&#x27;d rather stick to the tiny subset that is available consistently and ignore the rest.<p>And I suspect that most big cities got a similar patchy coverage pattern as in London.",1449575896

Just chrome for the one and gmail for the other.<p>The way it works is simple, I made a random url, stuck a script in there that sends an email with the url as the subject header. The first script I visited using chrome, the second script I mailed myself a link to from another email account to a gmail account. Both scripts fired when chrome activated the links so I know they work, then I simply let it rest.<p>I guess the gmail one would require re-crawling of all gmail for it to fire, the chrome only one would be dependent on the version of chrome that I ran the test on phoning home with the link, and I did not re-try this for every version of chrome (or on every platform). So it&#x27;s not a perfect method but it definitely puts the lie to chrome or gmail data being directly used to power google search results that people would expect to remain confidential because only they have the urls. Score one for obscurity and nice of google to ignore these paths.<p>I could set up another url for a test using the DNS but you&#x27;re free to do so yourself as well of course, it is definitely an interesting idea.<p>And if either of those scripts ever does fire I&#x27;ll rip google a new one, that would be the sort of abuse of trust that gets my temperature up.

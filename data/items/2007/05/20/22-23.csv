23469,comment,23390,23390,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>'... The mistakes novices make come from a lack of experience (kids) ... they make this kind of mistake a thousand times before they learn better. But the experts (grown-ups) make the opposite mistake, so that when a real once-in-a-lifetime change comes along, they are at risk of regarding it as a fad. As a result of this asymmetry, the novice (kids) makes their one good call during an actual revolution, at exactly the same time the expert (grown-up) makes their one big mistake, but at that moment, that`s all that is needed to give the newcomer a considerable edge. ...'</i><p>Interesting. You can see this direct observation with the actions of any child who randomly practice and play with things they encounter to create or do something new. Older, wiser people with years of experience are either bored and see no advantage in play so they don't. Only to realise later that they should have tried this earlier. Is this a natural adaption process that adults outgrow? Is this process a non-optomised way for chance discovery and improvement?<p>There is also a dark side. Experts are experts for a reason, conservative competence. You don't want your accountant or lawyer advising you on something using trial and error techniques. The lack of experience in some skill-sets will also cause startups to fail ( <i>#14, Poor investor management</i> ~ <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html</a> ). Successful entrepreneurs need to harness playfulness and hope their lack of experience doesn't cause them to fail. Serial entrepreneurs turn the playfulness on or off when required or find alternative strategies to plug areas they don't their inexperience into failure.<p>Maybe thats why a few grey heads are sometimes an advantage in guiding startups?\n",1179700651
23468,comment,23354,23354,0,0,Tichy,,,"Is there any data available on the numbers of people starting companies in each age group? Perhaps older people really are less likely to try it, which would explain why there might be fewer successful startups founded by older people. Without that number (startups by age), it is impossible to deduce the likelihood of success by age just from the number of successful startups by age.<p>Without seeing such numbers, it seems plausible to me that there would be less older founders for reasons that have been cited before on YC. People with families are simply less likely to take the risk.",1179700500
23467,comment,23390,23390,0,0,JohnN,,,"the article seems to be suggesting, the older you are, the less original your thinking can be. we know this is not necessarily true but is it generally true? though the ""idea"" is central to a start-up, older entrepreneurs can add experience if they have dealt with banks, lawyers, vc's, operations, hiring etc in the past. These less glamorous tasks can often be the difference between success and failure. don't write off older entrepreneurs just yet!",1179700276

23455,comment,23368,23428,0,0,rms,,,"#1:   Institutional investors in biotech require patents for funding. Period. Without a patent, there is no funding. If you don't have a patent, you're probably stepping on someone else's IP. Unlike software patents, life science patents are real and enforceable.<p>#2:   There are regulatory issues for most biotech startups. This means you may need 3 years of cash to burn before you have a chance of seeing revenue.<p>#3:   Startup costs are all around higher. Just about always, biotech startups need specialized high end lab equipment in very specific lab spaces. The only lab I've found that will take me is in San Jose and is $3,000 a month. The _only_ commercial lab space in Pittsburgh is with a state sponsored institutional investor and they only give space to portfolio companies.<p>\nA YC for biotech would need to be a true incubator with office/lab space. And you'd have to give each team $100,000. In biotech, $100,000 is equivalent to the ""living expenses only"" money that YC gives out. <p>It could very well work and I'd love to see it but someone would have to put up a very, very large amount of capital for something very risky by the standards of biotech investment.",1179698917

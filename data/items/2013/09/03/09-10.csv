Being able to distinguish the phonemes that you hear is just the first step, and it should logically be followed by learning to produce the sound distinctions in question yourself. And it is definitely a two-way feedback loop in that the better you hear the differences, the better you produce them, and vice versa, just as it is for infants learning their native language. So a more complete training method would combine HVPT with ways to have your own pronunciations scored to see how well you are producing the sounds of the target language.<p>This is I feel a relatively neglected part of non-native language education, and it is very common for people to have spoken a non-native language for years without learning to distinguish native sound pairs. So good luck with your efforts to help people learn better, and I hope you share the results with us.",1378202246

It is probability distribution of the frog legs touching the ground on a radial line from door to the wall, i.e. peaks at 0, A, 2A, 3A,.... It is about the same as position operator for electron would produce on a radial line from slit to the screen.\nAlso note that the frog doesn&#x27;t interact with the wall if the frog is &quot;airborne&quot; (i.e. one can imagine that it just goes through the wall without leaving a wet spot or even better - the wall is too low, say 0.1m , so airborne, mid-flight, frogs would fly over it).<p>If you look at this image<p><a href=""http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/java/interference/doubleslit/doubleslitjavafigure1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/java/interference/doubles...</a><p>the red concentric lines is where a frog most probably touches the ground and the greenish-yellow - where a frog is most probably mid-jump airborne (flying at the height enough to fly over the wall). Where 2 yellow-greenish lines intersect right near the wall - it is the place with minimal probability of a frog landing near the wall, ie. dry place. While intersection of 2 reds - correspondingly a very wet place.<p>>The fact that electrons in Hitachi&#x27;s experiment display a &quot;many-humped&quot; distribution is good evidence that the electrons are not following the same rules as the frogs, and hence that the electrons are behaving non-classically.<p>this non-classical behavior is the quantization of position, ie. position probability density looks like concentric waves starting at a slit. I.e. cut along the radial line, the profile of that density is a correctly scaled cos(x), with x - distance from the slit. The superposition isn&#x27;t necessary for the observed effect.<p>>> in Hitachi experiment it is shown explicitly clear that quantum interference is emerging only for multiple particles.<p>>This is the exact opposite of what the Hitachi experiment shows. The experiment is interesting and surprising precisely because particles are sent one at a time but still show an interference pattern. The experiment shows a single particle interfering with itself.<p>i&#x27;m trying to understand where do you see the interference of a particle with itself. Lets say the experiment was run only until there is only 1 (i.e. 2 sec into the clip), or say 3 particles hit the screen (4 seconds into the clip).

6319855,comment,6318998,6319696,4,0,pisarzp,,,"> There are two systems at work here, the credit system and the ATM system. The latter uses a PIN (no chip, so basically online verification) but the primary difference is related to chargebacks and fraud. Like in the UK, in a PIN system if I know your PIN and get your card I can loot your account and you are SOL. In the US a credit card transaction with a signature but no PIN means that the merchant is on the hook for fraud. If I get your card number and go on a spending spree you are not going to take a hit for any of the charges, the merchants are.<p>That is absolutely true. However thanks to chip, cards cannot be copied or forged. Therefore merchants are paying lower commissions on debit/credit card payments as there are fewer fraudulent transactions. Some merchants are even declining to accept non chip-and-pin cards (not sure if is legal though).",1378199162

You said this:<p>>> If you assume that the observer is described by quantum mechanics, then the Everett Interpretation is logically required to be true.<p>To the above pseudoscientific claim, I replied, saying:<p>> Arthur Conan Doyle notwithstanding, in science the truth is not arrived at by eliminating the alternatives. Science requires positive evidence -- absence of contrary evidence doesn&#x27;t support a given outlook. Were this not true, Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster would win acceptance through lack of contrary evidence.<p>Now if you want to discuss this issue, then stop wandering away from the topic into pointless philosophical tangents. Mathematics is not science, only science is science.<p>> Next, you&#x27;re obviously fond of Karl Popper&#x27;s falsifiability criterion.<p>Karl Popper didn&#x27;t invent fasifiability, he discovered it. Science is not defined by Popper, it is defined by falsifiability. Falsifiability is science 101, and it&#x27;s not a debate topic.<p>> While showing blithe unawareness of how poor a description it is of actual science through the ages.<p>I&#x27;m accustomed to having discussions with people who can&#x27;t be bothered to examine their own ideas. So, even though you are probably never going to get this, let&#x27;s perform a thought experiment in which falsifiability is not required for science, see where it takes us (I originally wrote this to counter the myth that psychology is a science):<p>Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m a doctor and I&#x27;ve created a revolutionary cure for the common cold. My cure is to shake a dried gourd over the cold sufferer until he gets better. The cure might take a week, but it always works. My method is repeatable and perfectly reliable, and I&#x27;ve published my cure in a refereed scientific journal (there are now any number of phony refereed scientific journals). And, because (in this thought experiment) science can get along without defining theories, I&#x27;m under no obligation to try to explain my cure, or consider alternative explanations for my breakthrough — I only have to describe it, just like a psychologist.<p>Because I&#x27;ve cured the common cold, and because I&#x27;ve met all the requirements that psychology recognizes for science, I deserve a Nobel Prize. Yes or no?<p>Ask yourself what&#x27;s wrong with this picture, and notice that the same thing is wrong with psychology — all description, no explanation, no established principles on which different psychologists agree, no effort to build consensus, and no unifying theories.<p>> If you understand the last, then you&#x27;ll understand that Einstein&#x27;s rejection of QM ...<p>You are, as usual, missing the point that Einstein objected until direct observational evidence became overwhelming in favor of quantum theories. He gave way before falsifiable evidence that, refutable in principle, was not refuted. The reason? Unlike you, he was a scientist, not a philosopher.<p>> ... needs no more explanation than Fred Hoyle&#x27;s rejection of the Big Bang theory ...<p>Guess what happened to Fred Hoyle&#x27;s rejection of Big Bang theory? It gave way before falsifiable evidence, evidence that remains in principle falsifiable to this day.<p>The people over at the Discovery Institute (the source for Creationism and &quot;Intelligent Design&quot;) will be delighted by your position on pseudoscience -- it&#x27;s exactly the same as theirs. As far as they are concerned, you can call anything science. If you keep crashing into goal posts like falsifiability on your way to your personal objective, no problem -- move the goal posts.<p>Link: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability</a><p>Quote: &quot;<i>Science must be falsifiable.

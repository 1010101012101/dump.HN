Maybe you have it too.<p>Think about a light wave. You might imagine a diagram like this:<p><a href=""http://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/graphs/Wave.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/graphs/Wave.pn...</a><p>Yep, you've seen it a million times. Light is a wave and wiggles up and down... right?<p>Oh really? Do you think the fastest thing the universe travels in a <i>zigzag</i> pattern? Hey, why don't we beat the speed of light by moving on a straight line! Nobel prize time!<p>No, the y-axis is <i>amplitude</i> of the field. The graph is not a Family-circus dotted line following the particle's motion!

2484556,comment,2483976,2483976,19,0,ojosilva,,,"Just for clarification: Richard Feynman, Nobel physicist wrote this piece about his experiences teaching in Brazil in... 1950.<p>So I don't think this is a very precise account of education in Brazil nowadays, but it sure does sound like education there (and almost anywhere else) in the 50s -- my mom tells me she would read out loud to herself until dawn the day before an exam, as she was taught auditory learning. This is not so common now as it was then.<p>But I agree that unfortunately, to this day, in any country and most schools out there, science is still taught to a large extent through dumb memorization and automatic formula application. Thus Feynman critique stands fresh and sound despite the anachronism. I feel education hasn't advanced nearly as fast as science, math, technology and society in the last century and a half.<p>(BTW, Feynman was infatuated with Brazil, and used to visit the country often. He even dressed up for carnival in Rio once: <a href=""http://goo.gl/3p5RS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/3p5RS</a> -- I wish he would tell more about that in his autobiography, instead of such a broad generalization of his experience teaching there.)",1303811475

2484514,comment,2481147,2483711,5,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I wanted to take some time to give a more carefully thought-out reply to this, because your accusation (implied in ""being sanctimonious"") is totally fair, and one that I level at others sometimes.<p>I don't think it's wrong to express strong disapproval of political issues even if I'm not currently politically involved, because the fact is, I spent most of my twenties thinking about how to effect (big) change in the world, and the answer I came up with was that, first, I had to become wealthy. I concluded that the political process itself was badly broken, that there were serious social issues stretching back many decades, and that while working as a teacher or a politician might have some impact, it would ultimately almost certainly be less effective than accumulating a huge amount of resources and then putting those resources into play in ways that I think would be beneficial to the world. That doesn't mean that I don't spend any time at all on other endeavors -- one of the first things I hope to do after opening up a local shop is host mechatronics classes for kids, because I think it's important for technologists and others to teach their craft to the young. However, politics in general -- whether at the local, state, or national level -- requires disproportionate amounts of attention, with few benefits. It is a huge distraction from my primary goals, so I'm not inclined to get involved with it. Not <i>completely</i> disinclined though: I did apply and interview for a local planning commission position, I have attended city council meetings in two local towns, I have been the tech guy for a California wanna-be governor's campaign a couple of years ago.<p>But in the end, spending much effort on organizing rallies or protesting with signs, <i>for me</i>, is self-defeating ... at least to some extent.<p>I also don't think that the President is above reproach just because the job is difficult. I have a tremendous amount of respect for just how difficult the job is; it's obvious to anyone that watches how quickly various Presidents age while in office. <i>It is a physically debilitating position to have.</i> That said, the President is (supposed to be) elected to deal with issues like this. I do not think that ""they gave it an honest shot"" is a reasonable way to accept failure on certain issues. I also think that, as a candidate who ran on platform issues like transparency in government and workers' rights, the President has disenchanted many of his most ardent supporters, which is really a rather big problem because many of these people became politically active for the first time in nearly a decade in order to get him into office. His supporters did not want to elect a ""lesser evil"", they wanted to elect <i>change</i>. To what degree any change has occurred is a matter of perspective, but I think it's hard to argue that it has fallen far short of expectations and promises.<p>So, yes, I speak out on political issues that I think are important. I hold the President of the United States -- whoever he is -- to a very high standard, because I believe that it is necessary for the health of our country to do so. However, I don't do any of that to impress anyone, because impressing people won't help change anything.<p>I do it because people having more conversations like this one is, I think, the first step towards fixing some of the social and political problems in our country.",1303810033

AppleScript is lurking just around the corner, and you <i>do not want that</i>.<p>Also, syntax is superficial. Sure, some languages remain clunky and verbose even after getting to know them, but more often than not there's a reason why a language ""looks"" the way it does. Take J, for instance. It's a syntactical nightmare at first. But once you get used to the intricacies and discover the semantics, its code becomes oddly efficient and you wouldn't want it any other way.<p>[EDIT: Moreover, graphical representations of code aren't as desirable as you'd think they are. You can find plenty of attempts at turning UML (and similar stuff) into a proper programming language. It's about as cool and helpful as using Word when you could have emacs and LaTeX.]",1303809707

People without a phone handy can't scan them, so if you see an ad somewhere, and want to check it out later you can't just remember the URL<p>No problem, just put them both. For smartphone (or at least not-completely-stupid-phone) users (which are very common in e.g. Japan, where the use of these codes is extremely widespread) qr-codes and the like are a godsend: typing a 50 characters url correctly is a pain, scanning codes is trivial and just about instantaneous.<p>> For example, you might not want to take out your fancy new superphone in the subway.<p>Not everybody lives in the bronx. That is FUD and a non-issue.<p>> It's slow. If you have a current top-model, it might be tolerable, but it's easier to just type in a URL on many phones.<p>No on both counts. Scanning a qr-code takes a few seconds, typing a URL (especially a complex one) and ensuring you get it perfectly right (allowing for a pair of errors) takes <i>at least</i> as long <i>with a full keyboard</i>. Use a 10key, and the qr-codes win handily.<p>On my 3 years old smartphone (iPhone 3G), it takes roughly as long to start quiQR and Safari, and from quiQR I only have to hit the ""Scan"" button and aim the camera at the code. In Safari, I have to dismiss the favorites (if no page is loaded yet), potentially create a new tab/page, tap the URL bar, and then copy the URL.<p>And as you can see in the video, it took 5s from tapping on the qr-scanning application icon to having the Youtube application open, . Would you be able to type a youtube video URL (including the dozen of semi-random characters identifier) faster without any mistake? Outlook not so good.<p>> You need an app before you can actually scan them.<p>These apps are widespread, and again in Japan (where these codes are used a lot) I believe phones can scan them natively. Similar spread of codes in western countries would likely lead to phones bundling native support for them (e.g. via image recognition built in the camera software)<p>> I don't know where the code points to. If you give me an URL, I can already know something about it (e.g. cnn.com/ad2), with a QR-code, anything could happen.<p>A qr-code is just text encoding, and it often is a URL. It makes no difference. It's trivial to pop up the textual version of the code and prompt for further action. That's what pretty much all code-scan applications I've used do.<p>> 6) It looks stupid when you're scanning the code.<p>Oh noes, the humanity. Furthermore, if you believe you look stupid when scanning a code, trust me that's nothing compared to copying a URL from a print to a phone.",1303809284

Foursquare and their cohorts move it forward in time a bit to reflect ""I'm here,"" or sellING.<p>For a pedestrian example, think of the times you've called your cellphone or power company and the recording on the phone tells you to have the helper send you to a satisfaction survey. Now transpose that to proximity services: you leave a restaurant and your phone pops up, ""Thanks for visiting! Care to tell us how we did?"" ...which is then popped-up to the manager. Googlers are smarter than me, so I'm sure they have more nuanced and lubricative plans, but you get the idea.<p>Yelp deals with what you're planning or where you've been, bracketing your experience, and the coupon services act as nudges against your retail future. 'Long as you keep checking your phone, that is. The pot of gold I feel is to reflect where the user will actually go (determination).

Sometimes building something really shows you new insight into a problem or system, but other times it ends up being 90% drudge work of the ""accidental complexity"" variety.<p>One approach to mitigate it is to try to find a lightweight prototyping process you can use, where you still actually write functioning code, but hopefully in a way that's less constraining. This is particularly useful if your ""real"" code is tied up in frameworks and Enterprisey architecture, which tend to be hard-to-steer ships.<p>Many parts of the Lisp and Python communities consider ease of open-ended, exploratory programming one of their main goals, so you might find something useful there. Prototyping the core ideas in some simpler way can also help; e.g. a lot of game designers will test out mechanics ideas by building little 2d demos where triangles interact with squares, even if the real game isn't going to look like a 2d abstract game.",1303808850

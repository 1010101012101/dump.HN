Nothing is allowed in the CVS tree if it is not documented.<p>OpenBSD has fewer drivers, certainly, but the ones they do have are excellent quality. Check out the driver for a device supported by both sometime. Often the OpenBSD driver will be 3-5x smaller and far clearer to read. This is especially the case with wifi drivers.

It's a useful trick when you're working with extremely constrained computers whose memories are measured in single digit kilobytes, but long ago was recognized as really difficult to use in writing quality software.  Real self-modifying code, which means code that actually overwrites the instructions the processor will execute, makes it incredibly hard to reason about programs and debug the resulting software.  Real self-modifying code was long ago relegated to the likes of Mel (<<a href=""http://www.cs.utah.edu/~elb/folklore/mel.html>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.utah.edu/~elb/folklore/mel.html></a>).  As I understand it, most Lisp programmers simply mean that their system properly handles the replacement of most (all?) functions/methods/definitions at runtime, which is in large part true of Python as well.<p>I open to being corrected by a Lisp programmer using a modern Lisp (hence my request for SBCL) to show an example of <i>real</i> self-modifying code, but I really don't expect that any will, because I don't think anyone's seriously written such code since I was out of elementary school.",1275511227

Some health issues severely limited my prior ability to ""get in the zone"", let alone stay there.  On days when the physical symptoms receded, I could do so.<p>Actually, this was one of the most frustrating aspects of the health issues.<p>If you have trouble concentrating, do not overlook or discount your physical health.<p>A separate comment.  For me, personally, it can take an hour or two to really get into the zone.  That can be a challenge.  Once really there, distractions fade into the background and I can work a good 8, 10 hours, until outright exhaustion overcomes my concentration.  I may take some breaks, sometimes just to walk around by myself.  Actually, this can aid the overall process.  I stop the conscious concentration and heavy (in my work, typically) visual input.  A walk, maybe a cup of tea, etc., engages my other senses and different sensory processing.  The work remains in my subconscious, and not infrequently, the change in attention allows me to make subconscious progress that I might not have achieved or so readily achieved through conscious attention.<p>In such a state, I don't just consciously, step by step, put ""pieces"" of information and steps of processes together.  I tend to form an increasingly developed ""Gestalt"" of the material and my ideas, and new ideas and relationships reveal themselves as my overall attention (conscious and subconscious) continues to analyze and infer.  It's one of the more enjoyable sensations of living.<p>Until I get deeply into that mode, interruptions and distractions can be quite disruptive.

Unfortunately there are 12 notes in an octave in the Western music system so you end up with bad ratios if you want to use instruments which are tuned to play anything more than a single key. If you are in complete control of your pitch, like with voice or violin or other stringed instruments, the all of the players can adjust their intonation on the fly when the keys change, and still keep the nice whole number ratios.<p>Enter church organs, which are huge, expensive, and can't be tuned while they're being played. But they're very nice and impressive. So they were tuned to play in only one key -- C. That's why the keys representing the scale of C major on a keyboard are all white, and the other (less important) notes are smaller black keys. You won't be pressing these very often, better to get them out of the way.<p>Then along came some math people who calculated tables of compromises that ended up giving a pretty decent sound to harmonies, but was laid out in a way so that you could play different keys without having to adjust your tuning or intonation. There were different systems, but they were referred to as having temperament. Hence the name ""Well-Tempered Clavier"" in the famous composition for keyboard instruments, which made ample use of the newfound ability to change keys whenever one pleases.<p>So now there are a bunch of keyboard players who can suddenly play in any key they want with the new tuning systems. But the keyboard layout is still same one used for  playing only in C. That all happened hundreds of years ago, but we're still stuck with the original layout for keyboards.",1275509998

Although it sounds good, unlimited plans are a real problem, because they distort the incentives for just about everybody.<p>For users, there's no cost-benefit balance for using bandwidth, only benefit. This leads to inefficient use of what is, at the end of the day, a limited resource. For the carrier, there's every incentive to minimize the amount of network activity, so they can squeeze more users onto the network. It's hard to know how this affects Apple, but is there any doubt that the fragility of the exclusive carrier in their primary market has affected their development schedules and priorities? App developers don't care about bandwidth, <i>except</i> to the extent that they can get their app banned by the carrier if they use too much of it.<p>Unlimited data plans are not the only factor, but it's no coincidence that AT&T has such poor network performance, doesn't allow tethering etc. This even affects iPhone users in other countries - would the iPhone have supported tethering earlier, if AT&T could make more money from the increased network activity? What about downloading music over the air? Skype?<p>With a pay-for-what-you-use pricing scheme, the interests of the user and the carrier are more closely aligned.

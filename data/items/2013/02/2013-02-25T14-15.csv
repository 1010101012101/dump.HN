5279167,comment,5278806,5279088,6,0,yareally,,,"Reading the Android forums, I see users refer to phones barely 6 months old as being out of date and year old phones as antiques. I find that puzzling  as they're most likely not doing anything that requires the latest device out there (they're not modding/developing, just end users that want latest shiny toy). If their phone isn't getting OS updates, then it at least has some weight, but I've seen users calling Nexus phones that as well.<p>I guess it's a hobby for some to trade in phones every few months.

5279155,comment,5278949,5278949,76,0,cletus,,,"37signals comes down against a decree of no more remote working. I am shocked (shocked that there is gambling going on in this establishment).<p>Much like hiring practices this is and will continue to be a divisive issue. This one however seems to be largely driven by personal preference: if you want to work from home, you can't understand why anyone is against it. If you don't, then you do.<p>I fall in the camp of not necessarily being against remote working but it's not something I want to do, I understand why companies don't want it and I don't think working remotely scales.<p>The last is the most important point. Many take the view that they can be much more productive with flexible work schedules and when people don't bother them with trivial stuff and when they don't waste time on the commute.<p>Firstly, working from an office doesn't not exclude a flexible work schedule. I've gone through phases where I don't get into work until 3pm. A guy I know decided he would take Thursdays off and work on Saturday instead. My manager forgot I was going on vacation for a few days and I didn't get a call or email asking where I was until midday Tuesday (having not shown up on Monday).<p>As far as not being bothered, this can certainly be true. This is actually part of the reason why I often wear headphones. Noise-cancelling headphones do a pretty good job of filtering out a lot of noise but just the act of wearing headphones I tend to find acts as a psychological barrier from others bothering you.<p>As for commute, this much is true and is a particular problem in the Valley. For me, my commute is a 7 minute walk to work (in NYC). YMMV. :)<p>But a lot of people make the same mistake with this issue that they make with hiring practices: they tend to think that the individual case matters. It really doesn't. If a hiring process weeds out some qualified candidates, it doesn't mean it's broken. Whether or not it's broken is determined by whether the company finds a suitable candidate, how long it takes and how expensive it is. False negatives don't matter (to a company) as long as you get a positive result.<p>The same goes here. The individual thinks they can work from home and they may well be right but there are bigger issues. For teams--particularly large teams--to work together requires a certain camaraderie that is orders of magnitude easier to manage when physically colocated. This also applies to teams that are geographically split. All other things being equal, a team in N sites will perform better than a team in N+1 sites.<p>The other issue, and this particularly applies to large companies, is one of culture. Culture like team cohesion is orders of magnitude easier to spread when physically colocated. For a company the size of Google (my employer), IMHO this is <i>far</i> more important than any individual perceived benefits about permanent remote work.<p>Google has (IMHO) done a remarkably good job of maintaining cultural consistency such that transplanting an engineer from one team to another is <i>relatively</i> seamless. This isn't just about common tools either.<p>Chris Dizon wrote a great post called <i>Twelve months notice</i> [1]. I like it because it articulates the primary difference (in my experience) between those who work remotely and those that don't. In my experience, those who work remotely tend to be far more in the <i>transactional work</i> category. While there's nothing wrong with this and I think it's particularly suited to freelance consulting, IMHO it is at odds with running and maintaining a large engineering organization.<p>But I know I'm not going to convince anyone. This another polarizing issue. Just be aware there are bigger issues than the individual not wanting to drive to work.<p>EDIT: Also, I disagree with the position that this ""punishes"" good employees. Yahoo wants to build (or rebuild) an engineering culture. They've decided this is easier to do with engineers physically colocated. This doesn't preclude workers from working from home on an occasional basis (eg waiting for the cable guy). It simply means the default is you come into the office.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://cdixon.org/2009/10/23/twelve-months-notice/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdixon.org/2009/10/23/twelve-months-notice/</a>",1361803608

5279089,comment,5278585,5279018,2,0,jacques_chester,,,"I would say that main things to remember about law in common law jurisdictions are:<p>1. The judge does not seek evidence, does not provide evidence, and does not provide arguments. The presentation of fact and law is the job of the plaintiff/respondent or prosecutor/defendant (depending on civil or criminal law).<p>2. The judge rules on what is introduced during court cases.  Judges almost always follow judgements that have been made previously -- precedent, also called <i>stare decisis</i> or ""let the decision stand"". In this case the precedent identified was <i>Hotson</i>. A lower court judge who presumes to modify a higher court's principles can expect that the higher court will accept an appeal on matters of law.<p>3. The legal system's purpose is to render certain, verifiable judgements. Judgements can't be uncertain (""You are sentenced to a 95% chance of prison"" or ""between 20,000 and 50,000 is awarded to the plaintiff for damages"" is not helpful), so as a step in the process of legal reasoning, information about uncertainty is deliberately destroyed. This is called ""balance of evidence"" or ""preponderance of evidence"" in civil trials, or ""beyond reasonable doubt"" in criminal trials. It is deliberately imprecise, because all attempts to introduce mechanical rules for evidentiary judgement have so far proved to be even more gameable than the fuzzy statements.<p>The legal system is profoundly introspective. Lawyers will introduce matters of legal interpretation in argument, these must be addressed. Appeals to higher courts are usually only possible on questions of law, meaning that very fine details of legal reasoning are constantly being teased out.<p>Judges must constantly weigh what the law <i>is</i>, and they also at higher levels frequently decide <i>how</i> the law is determined to be what it is. Given that subjects like jurisprudence and interpretation of laws can have massive practical consequences, it's an area that receives great scrutiny.<p>I became interested in the methods of analysis and judgement because of Australian constitutional law, where there are -- depending how you count -- between 4 and 6 basic schools of thought on how to interpret the Australian Constitution.",1361802598

It gives people a path whereby, instead of climbing the organizational ladder, their efficiency gains are paid back to them in the ability to retain employment with a reduced work footprint.

Lower-case types in signatures are placeholders in polymorphic functions. The signature<p><pre><code>    (.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
</code></pre>
means: The function that is the . takes a first argument (g) that maps some type b to some type c. The second argument (f) maps some type a to the type b. This ensures that you can always do g(f(x)). The result of the function . is a function that maps the type a (what f takes) to type c (what g returns).<p>The type signature only deals with types; this is not connected to the names of the function parameters.<p>Lambda expressions are written without types; they can be inferred (i.e. the return type is not void* , but exactly determined by the compiler). A lambda expression in lambda calculus notation would be written ""x.(+ x 1)"". Haskell slightly modifies this, and allows infix operators: ""\x -> x + 1""(the \ looks a bit like ). Punctuation functions are infix by default.<p>About the data expression: This constructs a new type (typedef). The ""|"" operator is just used in a declarative fashion. Every time you write Empty in your source code, that thing <i>is</i> a list. The expression ""list = Cons foo Empty"" would create a list of one element (foo). A cons cell is a pair, this terminology is popular in Lisp. These confusing data type constructors allow pattern matching, as you have seen in the definition of ""map"": If the list is Empty, return Empty. If the list is a Cons of an element and another list, then return a Cons of (result of our function applied to that element) and (the rest of the list mapped)  recursion.",1361801332

It'd be nice to make step 1, 2 and 3 boxes to be same height, as well as vertically align the controls in those boxes, so they are on one visual line. Currently it's a bit too ""jumpy"" (look at big text field, then look a bit up to see time entry, then down on ""wake myself"" button).<p>3. I'd be nice to have ""sign in"" as either popup or just sliding area on the frontpage, without having to navigate to a separate page.<p>4. ""remember me"" does not align with actual checkbox (osx, latest chrome)<p>5. No error messages seems to be displayed when logging in with non-existing account.<p>6. When signing up, on ""Fill out profile"" page there seems to be a bit too much of the whitespace between the actual title (""Fiil out profile"") and controls panel.<p>7. ""Sign up"" text on button on ""Fill out profile"" is a bit misleading - have I already signed up or not? If yes, than it should read something else. If no, then it should reflect that as well.<p>8. Is service US-only? It probably should say that straight away, so people from other countries don't waste their time signing up. (Actually you do already, but only on the front page - needs to be on sign up page as well I guess).<p>9. ""Sign out"" should probably mention user name somewhere, that's just a common UI convention.<p>That's just a cursory glance.<p>Thanks.",1339912676

The thing is, when dialog buttons use standardized vocabulary (ok, cancel, yes, no) you don't have to read the other button, you just assume it says the opposite of the first button. So I'd like the OP to provide some proof of this three scan pattern. I think that happens on a Mac where the buttons are labeled with verbs. When I was using Windows with the standardized yes/no/ok/cancel, I processed dialog boxes much quicker than on the Mac. I'd simply read the one or two words in the title (usually a verb), read the leftmost button, then decide whether to click it or whether to freak out. It goes like this:<p>Computer: ""Delete?""
Me: Yes.<p>Computer: ""Delete?""

If you are too lazy to use one of the many excellent logging apps or softwares, this will be great, if you have an iPhone. All in all it is a well designed gimmick for Sanofi to <i></i>sell moar strips<i></i>.<p>I was really hoping for something cool with that title, like maybe using the camera and flash to magically estimate your mg/dl when your in a bind.<p>But then I read:  
>Over 18 million Americans have diabetes, and they all live with the painful, often thrice-daily process of using needles to check blood sugar. The process is clunky and uncomfortable  and dangerous due to potential errors.<p>And thought, it's not really painful at all, hopefully people check more than 3 times per day, it may be awkward to check in public but not clunky.<p>I am pretty pissed at the pace of technology development in the diabetes arena, but this is not exactly a step forward.",1339909617

It satisfies every requirement you have described out of the box and only takes minutes to set up. Unless you wanted to process a ton of past data it probably would have been easier for you to skip all the manual data entry excel requires.",1339909601

The demand isn't created by governments seeking to purchase the exploits, it's created by criminal organizations willing to use exploits for botnets, identity theft, and other monetization models. That ZDI, and VUPEN etc are purchasing exploits only improves security.<p>View it like this. The exploits are out there, discovered and used by black hats. The idea that a whitehat security researcher is in anyway decreasing the level of security by selling an exploit to Google, or Apple, or any third party, is silly.<p>The more security researchers that are evaluating software, the more secure we'll be. Zero days will always be around, simply because the incentives are still favoring the blackhats. Until that's reversed, we'll be playing catch up.<p>The government buying exploits has nothing to do with why we can't have ""nice things."" We can't have ""nice things"" because this is a hard world, with people who won't blink to take advantage of poorly designed and poorly coded software.",1339909479

When they do something that sounds evil, we just assume it was an oversight and that they'll fix it.  Imagine our reaction if Microsoft released something with this clause in the TOS.",1220402879

I am not asking for much money; just enough to get me by.<p>Over the past year, I have learned how to get the 99.9% of my code to render properly in IE6, IE7, Firefox 2.0, Firefox 3.0, Safari, and Opera using strict HTML and CSS without using an excessive amount of <div> tags.  I also use VIM as my text editor and am getting faster and better at using it on a day to day basis.  If anyone is interested, please email me at lazukars[at]yahoo[dot]com so we can discuss this further.  I will then be happy to show you some examples sites.<p>Sincerely,\nRyan",1220402295

Providing a simple and highly robust browser is probably more ideal.  Do less but be indispensable at what you do.<p>I see this as a move that forces standards.  Google is putting its big shoulder behind increased performance and consistency on the internet.  If other people want to wrap the core offering in fancier clothes, I think Google still wins.",1220400272

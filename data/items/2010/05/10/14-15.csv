Nowadays any worthwhile site needs to include comments, reviews and ratings, twitter/blippy integration etc. The more social the better. You should also have book page previews and maybe youtube-hosted videos of author interviews/talks. Basically be an information rich site. Branching out to e-magazine publishing say for short stories (maybe get onto the iPad/Kindle that way) can help de-risk the business.<p>You should also develop a focus on some specific domain like the college textbook domain and market it heavily to that audience (professors/students). Discount cash/gift cards sold at campuses, good referral systems, mobile payment options, iphone/android integration are all good.<p>As you can see I've been giving this quite a bit of thought myself :), but don't think it's something I want to get into at the moment.

Zoning regulations are fun in part because the government can (and often does) make ad hoc exemptions for public schools but provides very little leeway for public schools. <a href=""http://reason.org/news/show/127456.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reason.org/news/show/127456.html</a> discusses a bit of the problem.<p>But to delve  a little deeper: in California, nearly every municipality of any size requires a special-use permit or conditional use permit (CUP) to build a school. There is no ""school"" zoning code. Almost never are such permits granted in industrial use areas, despite sometimes being locations that might have little to no risk. That means the school functionally has to get a CUP in a residential zone. Which residents often don't like because, even for a small school, it means a substantial increase in traffic. This is doubly difficult because not only does the school have to fight to receive zoning, but trivial-to-place legal challenges can lead to a huge expense. For instance, challenging zoning for environmental reasons is nearly trivial but an extended environmental impact report alone can cost millions of dollars.<p>So there's a substantial risk involved in the launch without any option for a quick buyout.

A lack of any real power.<p>True story: My mom once gave a child an F in english, he had a course average of 20%, the child's mom came in complained that her child COULD NOT go to summer school because they had a trip to europe already planned and booked, threatened a law suit and the principle made my mom raise change it to a D.<p>Another: in Florida at least it had become so difficult to hold a child back a grade in middle school that freshman were coming into high school who hadn't passed 5th grade reading tests. 14% of the freshman one year were functionally illiterate.<p>Neither of those had anything to do with ""government inefficiency.""

You cannot avoid having a value system, and if you do not perpetuate it, it will be outcompeted by one that will.<p>I'm not denying complexity, I'm providing extreme examples as aids to thought. Look at the two ends of the spectrum and ask ""What does my previously implicit value system say in these extreme cases?""<p><i>Would I oppose the Amish exemption? No, because the vast majority of students in this nation have access to basic education.</i><p>But don't the Amish children deserve to have the option to partake in broader society? And won't they have more and better information upon which to condition that choice if they attend government run schools until the normal school leaving age? Aren't they being <i>harmed</i> by being denied that opportunity?<p><i>teaching violent fundamentalism at the expense of basic education</i><p>What's violent fundamentalism? What's basic education? If the violent fundamentalists are the only ones providing education of any sort, a minimum of literacy for example, isn't that better than nothing for the vast majority of those who receive it who never do crap with the violent bit of the fundamentalism but who can read and write and probably do arithmetic when their chances to do so otherwise would have been much less?<p>On degree mills; what's wrong with a solely instructional institution that certifies competence in a given area? Most people don't give a damn about education as growth for the soul, why should they subsidise those who do, and help perpetuate a costly signalling mechanism that is socially wasteful if an alternative exists?",1273500969

Most of the really good, senior level tech talent has been through the blender the first time around.  Options always seem to get screwed up somehow, and once someone has put in 70 hour weeks with the idea that their equity will blow up one day, it becomes quite a challenge to do that again as anything but a founder (which a lot of people really don't have the desire to do).  Combine that with the amount of finance (read: under educated) money in the investment pool, and the people who bring it (ex-bankers) and their relationship to hackers, the value of equity is really usually quite shitty.<p>edit: one other point:<p>Many of the graduates who don't know about the startup scene actually wont be qualified to work in it (those who are into it will mostly be qualified and are a small minority).  Generally speaking, you need to really be able to pull your weight in an early stage startup.  This is not something most people who have not been hacking on side projects (or working at startups as an intern etc.) for the last 4 years are generally capable of doing.  You really need to have had some ""real work"" experience, and after 4 years of coursework and coffee/xerox internships unfortunately a lot of these kids just don't.  We all want to believe the myth of the college kid startup genius, but the simple fact is it usually takes a few years before someone is really capable of the work required in a startup.  By that point they already have the golden handcuffs.<p>So I'm not sure it's as simple as academia and startups don't talk, there is a real reason startups aren't recruiting from NYU and Columbia undergrads.",1273500607

The public high schools I attended in California in the late 1960s were also good, and it was naturally expected in that day that the vast majority of the kids would not only graduate but would also be literate and reasonably taught once they did so - there too, all funding was purely local.<p>The key is to have the schools, whether public or private, in the hands of people who care really care about what the kids learn and that means local people who know them and know their families. This element has largely been lost in modern America's public schools, and it is a real tragedy.<p>It is nice to see the resourcefulness of parents who seek to overcome the resulting mess but this is a struggle that is often just plain desperate in light of the overwhelming problems that now beset the public schools.

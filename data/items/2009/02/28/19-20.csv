That doesn't mean that Java isn't good at solving a set of problems in a good way - it clearly is.<p>There's millions to be made from advertising revenue. If you can get people to pay for something, great, but not every product is the type where paying would make any sense at all. By charging consumers directly, you massively reduce your audience to a small subset of users.<p>It's quite funny to see people imply that advertising revenue isn't ""real"" revenue, or is in some way less valuable than getting customers to pay directly.<p>You know what the most powerful marketing word in the world is? ""FREE"".\nThe clever thing is using that to your advantage and still making money. Tons of industries do that though, loss leaders work, 'free cellphone (with contract) works' etc etc.",1235850822

498424,comment,498306,498306,0,0,tptacek,,,"""Approval, though, is not the goal of investing. In fact, approval is often counter-productive because it \nsedates the brain and makes it less receptive to new facts or a re-examination of conclusions formed earlier. \nBeware the investment activity that produces applause; the great moves are usually greeted by yawns.""<p>Also, surprising to me that this landed in his shareholder's letter:<p>Indeed, recent events demonstrate that certain big-name CEOs (or former CEOs) at major financial \ninstitutions were simply incapable of managing a business with a huge, complex book of derivatives. Include \nCharlie and me in this hapless group: When Berkshire purchased General Re in 1998, we knew we could not get \nour minds around its book of 23,218 derivatives contracts, made with 884 counterparties (many of which we had \nnever heard of). So we decided to close up shop. Though we were under no pressure and were operating in \nbenign markets as we exited, it took us five years and more than $400 million in losses to largely complete the \ntask. Upon leaving, our feelings about the business mirrored a line in a country song: “I liked you better before I \ngot to know you so well.”<p>Imagine how Citibank would have worded the same sentiment in its shareholder letter.",1235849850

Or I'm watching a TV show, and then a 10 second Ad about the new Lexus comes up. I'm interested, so I hit the interest button and when the show is over, a browsable website is available with more information.<p>But this will not work on the current broadcast system. It only works on the web, and that's why TV is going to have to merge with the Web. The infrastructure is almost all in place, it's just a matter of switching.

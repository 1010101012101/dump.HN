Even in the summer, in the UK, which goes to GMT+1, I stay in GMT.<p>What hours am I awake? Whatever hours are the most productive. If I have admin tasks then I'll be in daylight hours. Otherwise, I'm most productive doing extended stints.<p>I've noticed there is a large contingent of UK hackers on this forum. This could account for some activity outside of US office hours. The remainder is probably people doing irregular hours.",1202914716
114839,comment,114501,114501,0,0,wallflower,,,"During the Q&A period at a talk by Jeff Barr, the Amazon Web Services evangelist, a venture capitalist made an insightful remark. He said how they had given a company $4 million in financing. $1 million of that went to purchase/lease server hardware and storage.<p>Amazon.com's web services flips the traditional startup/venture capital financing paradigm. How?<p>#1 You can test out your business model on a small scale without investing heavily in infrastructure. Why build it before they come? Is your business model working? Is it profitable? You can find this out. As a side effect, the businesses built on amazon.com's web services may be more self-sustaining than one that is simply siphoning off from a pool of initial capital funding .<p>#2 You can scale as needed with EC2 and virtual machines. EC2 lets you go from 10 to 100 to 1000 virtual machines in real-time, all running your virtual machine image. The caveat is: you need to learn how to build the right virtual machines and manage your virtual machines. Jeff made a remark about how erlang and map-reduce (both esoteric languages that deal with managing scalability) will be valuable skills in probably just a year.<p>#3 Your costs can go down. Why? Moore's law and whatever law/maxim regulates storage. As storage costs go down, Amazon.com can transfer on the savings to you - you can actually pay less per gigabyte of storage in 6 months. Compare that to having storage hardware that steadily depreciates and heads to slow obsolescence.",1202914716

I'd rather not say which specific club (I like to think I am a wallflower) but that Toastmaster club is/was a fantastic supportive environment to practice public speaking. For the only way to learn public speaking is to actually do it. The value of the feedback (handwritten comments that you get after a speech) was tremendous - where else can you get honest supportive feedback - people want you to succeed. The fact that it was a corporate club that was not my company was a plus - felt safe to talk about whatever - no coworkers (except the one guy I carpooled with).",1202914553

Yes, user-uploaded pictures barely meets minimum standards for ""user-generated content"" and hot-or-not voting barely meets minimum standards for ""discussion"".

114825,comment,114568,114568,0,0,jojoleflaire,,,"In my experience, the best way to break in is to find a process that either isn't handled or handled only tangentially by existing ERP packages. It helps too if that process represents a new way of doing business for your customers. That way you get to pitch for growing the top-line (i.e. creating dollars that didn't exist before your software came on the scene) vs. bottom-line savings that just cut costs.<p>Not to throw cold water on your idea, but I have deep reservations that pure technical expertise in generic enterprise development/implementation will win anyone over. All of the big guys plus numerous other consulting companies already offer this, with much more name recognition (deserved or not) than you will have. Additionally, one of the main features of packaged software is that customers not only are loathe to manage a development process, they are reluctant to even engage one in the first place.<p>But if you can distinguish yourself by being The Smartest and Best (TM) in a particular business area, all of your skills in execution can back that up and create a winning operation. But without that domain focus and expertise the story is much less compelling.",1202912744

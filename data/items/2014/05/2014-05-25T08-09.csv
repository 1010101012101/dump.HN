7795859,comment,7795621,7795764,4,0,opium_tea,,,"I&#x27;m of the impression that concepts only have fundamental meaning to us because we can relate them to sensory input.  For example, initially a child is taught what a boat is by seeing pictures, it eventually learns that boats, cars and bicycles share common characteristics and can be grouped together as vehicles.  These common characteristics are all understood and identified by seeing, hearing, touching or smelling.<p>It would be impossible completely describe a concept such as &quot;horse&quot; to a person with no knowledge of animal physiology, without recourse to pointing at a a horse or impersonating a horse noise. Resorting to analogies with other concepts - &quot;a horse is like a cow&quot; - doesn&#x27;t work because the person has no knowledge of the other concepts.  This person could be a young child or an untrained computer, and they can be taught fundamental meanings of concepts by feeding them information in the form of sights, sounds, smells etc.<p>I haven&#x27;t thought about this very deeply but these are the thoughts that always come into my mind when this topic comes up. Concepts have no meaning without relating them to sensory input. Humans learn by connecting the two.  Why can the same not be applied to computers?",1401007933

Arguments over correctness almost always devolve into a shouting match because no one ever defines what they mean by it. For your standard consumer application a notion of correctness doesn&#x27;t even exist so the argument is moot there. You have to narrow your domain a little bit to actually start talking about it. You have to get down to the level of protocols and interfaces and other mathematical beasts where correctness actually means something.<p>The standard example of correct software and in fact where most work on formal correctness tends to happen is in compiler design and distributed systems. So when you say that there is a tradeoff between speed and correctness that is simply not true. All those compilers you use are correct, for a very precise definition of correct, and fast and constantly improving.",1401007898

Immigrants (largely illegal ones). This is just like the goods we import from China. There is a slave class of people who clean toilets and work in Chinese factories.

About the only reason to do this would be to ensure if it was captured, the target wouldn&#x27;t see what was on it.</i><p>In fact, there&#x27;s a commercial (non-military) video recorder that does exactly that:<p><a href=""https://deniablevideo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://deniablevideo.com/</a><p>It&#x27;s basically on-the-fly encryption of continuous digital video (and, in this case, audio as well).<p>It would work something like the following: A new random symmetric key would be generated every X minutes, and a snippet of incoming video would be encrypted with that key. Each of those random symmetric keys would be encrypted with public key encryption and saved so that the video can be recovered later by someone who has the private key.<p>Given that a <i>commercial</i> product exists to do this, you would <i>think</i> that a military drone must obviously be doing it as well, right?<p>Well, I&#x27;m not so sure since we learned that drones were not even encrypting the live video feed back to ground controllers as recently as 2009:<p>&quot;<i>Militants in Iraq have used $26 off-the-shelf software to intercept live video feeds from U.S. Predator drones, potentially providing them with information they need to evade or monitor U.S. military operations.</i>&quot;<p>Full article is here: <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB126102247889095011"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB126102247889095011</a>",1401005635

I am undecided. The Cintiq looks really nice as a permanent workstation tool, but relies on a computer to run the application.

They were often based on unjustified models of whatever the author decided was a good model of thought/reasoning, whether &quot;frames&quot;, predicate calculus, constraint propagation or whatever. It seems to me that although you say statistical methods have little motivation, the motivation of the alternative - heuristics - is very questionable. Can anyone correct me on this?",1401005073

That would do a lot more damage.<p>If there are no good reasons to send drones into Iranian airspace because of Keyholes and so on then those reasons apply <i>just</i> as strongly to Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Persian Gulf. Clearly there are reasons to deploy drones and some of those reasons might apply to Iran.",1401004815

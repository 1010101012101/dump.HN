The overhead would be irrelevant except that state machines get used in very performance critical ways, such as inside a regular expression engine.  But possibly Clojure isn't the right language if you care about performance that much.<p>Incidentally I'd be shocked if trampoline was a special form rather than a function.  I'm not sure what type a function is (I don't use clojure nor is it installed here), but it should be possible to implement it something like this:<p><pre><code>  (defn trampoline [f]

906900,comment,906429,906702,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"I've done some work for a Federal government agency a few years back and a provincial government within the past year. eHealth was exceptional not because of the cost but because nothing got done.<p>Here's where posting anonymously is beneficial (but alas since it's anonymous, take my account with a grain of salt). My opinion is that a select few large IT companies in Canada  have a virtual monopoly on all government work. In fact, the only reason that I was involved in these projects was because certain teams from these companies screwed up so badly that some bureaucrats formed a skunk works side project to move things along. There was an unspoken understanding that the government wouldn't sue and shake the boat, but that they'd screwed up badly and needed to let another party try to resolve the situation.<p>Pretty much the only way you're going to get access to government contracts is via sub-contracting for these firms. To bring this post back on topic, the reason that this happens is because in a bid to try to account for government spending, the government issues these RFPs that are so lengthy and cumbersome to accomplish that only the big companies can actually pull them off. But it's a premature optimization and means that the government spends more money than it needs to. It's not unheard of for a simple web application to have a budget of CDN$1M. This would be something that your typical YCombinator team could pull off in 3 months and US$17K.<p>Some of the more successful government projects that I've heard of are ones where you have a bureaucrat that hires acquaintances without an active bidding process, because they can vouch for their expertise. Stuff gets done quickly and correctly the first time because there's little red tape to work around. Unfortunately, eHealth involved friends hiring friends and stuff just not getting done. I always thought that the criticism of eHealth folks hiring people they knew was less of a concern than the fact they simply didn't get stuff done. I mean think about it, in the private sector do you get people to actively bid on every little position and project or do you have your go-to guys?<p>Anyways, my opinion is otherwise largely positive with government work here in Canada. They seem to spend more money than I think they would if they let smaller more agile companies into the fold more often. But stuff seems to get done and when it doesn't (e.g., eHealth) you hear about it. Most of the government people I've worked alongside care very much about their job and doing it well. It wasn't unheard of for them to reply to my off-hours questions on their Blackberries on a weekend. So all is not lost. If I'm a little bitter, it has to do with what I perceive to be a rigged RFP process that favours these big vendors.",1256692445

8673087,comment,8671618,8673072,0,0,chrismccord,,,"Yes, this is similar to Plug, but we only have a &quot;connection&quot;. There is no distinction b/w request/response. A series of Plugs form a transformation layer on the connection where plug middleware can transform the connection, send a response etc. &quot;Yielding to the next plug&quot; is just a matter of returning the connection. There is no explicit yield. You either halt the connection (don&#x27;t invoke further plugs) or continue the stack by returning the conn unhalted. Where your &quot;upstream&quot; concept fits is a connection can have callbacks bound that are invoked just before the response is sent, this is where a cache plug would cache the response. Plug avoids the issue of separating request/response because for things like streaming, sending a response does not mean that the stack is done with the request. Rack has this issue with streaming and José put a great deal of thought into Plug around the lessoned learned from Rack style APIs. You can read about his thoughts here:

The Plug response API itself never halts when a response is sent.",1417235988

It has an interesting way of dealing with middlewares (would be Plug in Elixir world, I assume). Request and response are passed through the middleware chain downstream, and each of them can take the response from previous middleware(s), modify it if needed, and pass to the next.<p>Either the response reaches the last middleware, or one of middlewares returns immediately, the response goes back &quot;upstream&quot; through the middlewares again. Then it is replied to the client.<p>During the flow, each middleware can also yield to the next one, so that it can handle the updated response when it goes upstream.<p>Imagine the cache middleware. Request comes in, this middleware checks if there is a cache of that request. If not, it yields to the next middlewares that will retrieve and transform the data, then cache the response body before returning to client.<p>For me, this flow offers a lot of flexibility in request and response handling.

So really, its not hiding anything.<p>2. The resolution of the sleep call is WAY too high. We&#x27;re talking about detecting differences down to 15 nanoseconds. Sleeping for blocks of microseconds or even milliseconds will be far to granular. It will introduce block-like patterns in the requests that should be pretty easy to detect with statistical means.<p>3. It&#x27;s basically identical to a random delay. Considering it depends on the system clock, and the original request comes in at a random point, it&#x27;s functionally identical to calling sleep(random(1, 100)). And over time (many requests), that will average out.<p>Now, what if we took a different approach. What if we made the operation fixed-time?<p><pre><code>    execstart = utime()
    // whatever code
    // clamp to always take 500 microseconds
    sleep( 500 - utime() - execduration)
</code></pre>
That <i>might</i> work (assuming you have a high enough resolution sleep function). Again, it suffers the local attacker problem (which may or may not matter in your case).<p>However, there are two reasons I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it: It requires guesswork and idle CPU.<p>You would either need to actively guess every single operation (and remember to clamp it) or clamp the overall application.<p>If you do it for every operation, that sleep time can become expensive (if you have a lot of them).<p>If you do it on the application level, and if you do too little, an attacker can use other expensive control (like larger input introducing memory allocation latency) to increase the runtime past the sleep clamp (hence allowing them to attack the vulnerability anyway). If you do too much, the attacker can leverage it to DOS your site (since even a sleeping process is non-trivially expensive).<p>There are two valid ways of protection IMHO:<p>1. Make sensitive operations actually constant time.<p>2. Implement <i></i>strong<i></i> IP based protections to prevent the large amount of requests that would be needed to collect enough data to analyze noisy environments. (I need to add this to the post now that I write it).<p>Personally, you should be doing #2 anyway. But since I also believe in defense-in-depth, I&#x27;d do #1 as well.",1417234746

It&#x27;s not only about <i>massive</i> objects; it&#x27;s about <i>compact</i> ones.<p>If you have only one supermassive black hole, then the 2nd and 3rd objects are a binary star, and the interaction between <i>them</i> is very weak. Stars can&#x27;t orbit each other faster than ~100&#x27;s of km/s (~1,000&#x27;s for white dwarfs): they&#x27;re limited by their low density -- they can&#x27;t get very close or they&#x27;ll collide. If, instead, you have a star orbiting a <i>black hole</i> -- that&#x27;s a very dense object, it allows much closer approaches, much deeper into the potential well, with orbit speeds approaching the speed of light.<p>Don&#x27;t forget this is a <i>three</i> body interaction. You want a star kicked out of a black hole, with much more kinetic energy than it had going in. This kinetic energy comes from the potential energy of some other object falling into the black hole. How strongly the hypervelocity star gets kicked out, depends on how strongly it can interact with the infalling object, to transfer its energy.<p>(This idea is I think implicit in the paper (page 3): the &quot;kick&quot; velocity of a binary object falling into a black hole (v_kick) is at most a small constant times their mutual escape velocity (v_23)).<p><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5022"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5022</a>",1417234639

I started with .NET almost a year ago and I said I&#x27;m going to learn everything about the framework inside and out. I said it was my goal to be employed as a C# developer and love what I do. .. I haven&#x27;t touched C# in almost 3 months. I got interested in Android which led to Java which led to Spring which led to Grails then I said &quot;Hey whats Node JS?&quot; then Ember and Angular .. and one book after the next. I test drive a framework to see what it can do and I have spent about a month digging into about 10 different frameworks and do you know what I discovered?<p>They all do the same fucking thing. So with that I feel on one level I like being exposed to different languages on my personal time (Perl programmer/Sys Admin professionally) and I thought that this was really helping my programming skills in general. But now I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;ve caused more trouble than good. I know I have to pick a technology and literally stick with it. I have to see what I&#x27;m most passionate about. I am thankful for everything I have observed but its time to publish some apps. I feel like I do a lot of studying and have nothing to show for it. Rails, ASP.NET MVC, Spring MVC, and Grails all do the same thing. It just depends on what eco system and what language you&#x27;re most comfortable with and of course your work environment. All of this for me is personal exploration. At work we have a LAMP environment and our web apps are written in PHP. I&#x27;m just there to build my resume. I can&#x27;t stand PHP and am not passionate about the technology we work with. So yeah. Lost in a sea of code.",1417234374

It also adds new daemons for logs, logins, locales, hostnames and a few other services.<p>> But there are other objections from people who think systemd is too big in scope or too controlling or focussed on one technology or another or... some kind of conspiratorial trap or something (<a href=""http://boycottsystemd.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boycottsystemd.org</a>). I think these arguments are a little hyperbolic since systemd isn&#x27;t actually a single monolithic system and is really an overarching project to update a lot of major system utilities.<p>The problems start when those replacement system utilities become (more or less) tightly coupled, so if you want to change one of them (say, I want to use my own DHCP client) then you need to change all of them (and it&#x27;s increasingly looking like you can&#x27;t).",1417234302

They fall of a productivity cliff pretty quickly, particularly on larger projects (I&#x27;m talking things with 100+ domain objects). I&#x27;ve settled on:<p>Use CQRS (Command Query Response Segregation) and stuff ORMs where the sun doesn&#x27;t shine.<p>Separate Update/Insert/Delete commands and queries. Commands return nothing and are assumed to work unless an exception is thrown, then the whole batch is rolled back. Queries return data. Transaction boundaries are arbitrary based on the requirement of the calling service, not the unit of work and/or session. By default all transactions are imperative.<p>Stored procedures, triggers and views are banned.<p>Commands are classes with properties attached (easy to validate, test and provide good encapsulation) and are internally represented as raw SQL with bound parameters.<p>Queries return enumerable lists of objects and are internally represented as a raw SQL query with bound parameters.<p>Everything is programmed to generic interfaces: IStorageCommand<T> and IStorageQuery<T><p>That is all. I&#x27;ve used Dapper on .Net to do the internal representation. It is portable across non SQL stores as well and has been used to interface with cache and Redis as well.<p>Plus due to the loosely coupled abstraction, you can use AOP to stick read-through cache interceptors in between the IStorageQuery<T> interface and the consumer. Also you can stick cache invalidators between IStorageCommand<T> and the consumer.<p>Moving one of our core subsystems over to this with some careful design and DBA consultation knocked our 48 Core Xeon SQL box from 60% utilisation to 5% (mainly IOPS/storage throughput. CPU is a non issue there).",1412502710

8411858,comment,8411503,8411763,1,0,tzs,,,"> It is popular to characterize the gender gap in tech in terms of a pipeline problem: not enough girls studying math and science. However, there are several indications that this may no longer be the case, at least not to the extent that it once was. High school girls and boys participate about equally in STEM electives. Elite institutions like Stanford and Berkeley now report that about 50% of their introductory computer science students are women. Yet just last year, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that men are employed in STEM occupations at about twice the rate of women with the same qualifications.<p>Looking more into this, there are some other problems.<p>The link cited for &quot;High school girls and boys participate about equally in STEM electives&quot; says &quot;Girls are taking many high level mathematics and science courses at similar rates as their male peers, with the exception of physics and engineering, and are performing well overall&quot;. Note that part about engineering being an exception. For engineering, their source says the ratio of boys to girls is 6 to 1.<p>I&#x27;d expect engineering is most relevant for most tech jobs, and in that boys outnumber girls 6 to 1 in high school. That sure doesn&#x27;t sound like the pipeline problem is no longer a major factor.<p>Their same source also has stats for college. Women earn 50.3% of the science and engineering bachelor&#x27;s degrees, but like high school this varies by field. It was 18.2% in computer science and 18.4% in engineering. I don&#x27;t see any sign here either that the pipeline problem is diminishing.<p>Interestingly, women get 43.1% of the bachelor&#x27;s degrees in math and statistics. I&#x27;m surprised there is that big of a difference between math and CS.<p>In the workforce, the same source says that women are 13% in engineering, and 25% in computer and mathematical sciences (it is very annoying that CS and math are separate in the college stats and combined in the workplace stats).<p>Note the significant drop from degrees to workforce. In engineering, women are 18.4% of the degrees, but only make up 13% of the working engineers. I wonder if that gap could be due to the difficulty of having children while maintaining one&#x27;s career, which is definitely harder for women than men since women are the ones that actually give birth?<p>I&#x27;m beginning to think that the main causes of the gender gap in tech are the pipeline problem and the atrocious maternity and paternity leave standards in the US.<p>Most of Europe, I believe, has much much much much better maternity and paternity leave than the US does. Does anyone have any stats on if women who go into tech in Europe are more likely to stay compared to US tech women? Note that the data we want for this is not just the percentage of women in tech there compared to the US, because the pipelines into tech might be different. I think the number we want is, for various tech areas, percentage of women getting degrees in these areas and percentage of women in the workforce in those areas.<p>If maternity and paternity leave make a different, my prediction is that the percentages in the workforce will be closer to the percentages getting degrees in Europe than it is in the US.<p>One more interesting thing. The source the article cites for the pipeline data also gives a breakdown of the workforce by various science and engineering fields. Here are the percentages:<p><pre><code>   45.9% of chemists and material scientists\n   28.9% of environmental scientist and geoscientists\n   22.3% of chemical engineers\n   17.8% of industrial engineers\n   13.1% of civil engineers\n    8.8% of electrical and electronics engineers\n    5.5% of mechanical engineers\n</code></pre>\nI can see traditional differences in the way boys and girls are raised explaining why women are better represented in biological sciences than in physical sciences or engineering, but I cannot think of anything that would explain why the representation of women various so much between different engineering fields. I can&#x27;t think of anything that would have made me guess that women would be much better represented in chemical engineering than civil engineering, and in civil engineering than electrical engineering.",1412501268

Hell, that&#x27;s 5 times the GDP of Liberia at the moment. It would also need to train 85,000 medical professionals (doctors and nurses mostly) - all that in a country that&#x27;s just emerging out of war (basically 20 years of civil war ending 9 years ago), has low education levels (60% literacy - 4 in 10 people you meet can&#x27;t read and write), zero infrastructure, etc.<p>Let&#x27;s not forget that the NHS has been receiving that sort of funding for many decades - today&#x27;s infrastructure builds on yesterday&#x27;s infrastructure, etc.<p>I put it to you that the NHS would be brought to its knees by 3000 Ebola cases to deal with. If we ever let it get that bad in the UK, the only way we&#x27;re getting out of that is through a complete country shutdown (if that&#x27;s even possible in our supermarket-driven world - people would starve; starving people tend to do stupid things to get food).<p>Blame corruption all you want (though ironically, Liberia had elections that were widely regarded as fair, and that resulted in electing a highly qualified, female president, in 2005), but I think in Liberia&#x27;s case it is totally fair to say that with or without corruption this country is extremely ill-equipped to deal with an Ebola epidemic.<p>Links:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia</a><p><a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/about/Pages/overview.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/about/Pages/overview.asp...</a>",1412500372

It has 4 engines - if one engine fails, it crashes. It has inherently 1/4 of the reliability of a single engine helicopter. Losing one rotor blade will also cause a crash, so its 1/4 of the reliability there as well. QA, maintenance, and overhauls will cost 4x as much.",1412499887

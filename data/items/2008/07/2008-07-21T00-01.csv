Then one line  in /etc/printcap is all that is needed to be away and printing.<p>Similar story for networking devices, RAID cards, etc... you buy the ones you that are reputed to work well and avoid the others..",1216600902

251810,comment,250704,251657,0,0,jerry5,,,"I have a vague idea what you mean by the 'inefficiencies'. I am wondering whether these would have manifested in the first place if IT had been given a more central role. It's a lot about motivation too, the 'central' people in a business are usually motivated by being shareholders as well as employees at the same time. If you treat IT as just another accountant they will find endless means and ways to drag their feet and just generally pursue their own interests which are generally opposed to that of the business. Being linked into the flow of information, i.e. high level senior management decisions, is important too for efficiency.",1216600767

The ability to pause a song and change the volume would also be nice.<p>You should add some kind of visual tutorial (but keep it simple) at the top of the page so new visitors know what to do.",1216600721

Printers have been diabolical to set up in unix & linux forever! (PS: man-in-the-street can't administer any OS that's why they need all the help they can get)",1216600504
251806,comment,251400,251750,0,0,sratner,,,"Exactly. In .NET heap allocations are practically as fast as stack allocations, although of course there are other things you need to be aware of when using a compacting generational GC, such as avoiding medium-lived objects at all costs. .NET does also provide value-types that can be allocated on the stack, and you use them for reasons that are better than ""heap allocations are slow"".<p>I think the moral of the story is: to get the maximum performance out of your memory management system, you need to know how it works. This applies equally well to C++.",1216600329

Found 3 tracks for Sounds Like Chicken - my reference Obscure band.<p>but major FAIL in usage terms..  
* I start saving out a playlist - then realise there's nowhere to play it.  
* Normally I'd leave, but I figured I'd sign up.  
* Signup worked fine - and then I clicked on My Playlists
* And I'd lost my playlist!<p>Love the design though.",1216600197

You can move yourself in / out physically if you need to be closer. Forget the delete button too. Flash memory is expansive enough that you shouldn't have to worry about it on the hardware.<p>Make the camera have a shutter button, some simple way to view the pictures you have taken so far, and do all the rest in software in some sort of picasa/itunes-quality app.",1216600091
251802,comment,251774,251774,0,0,paulgb,,,"Looks good. I'm confused about how playlists work though - I can add songs to it, but how do I play it or view it? A killer feature that songza is missing is the ability to create and share a playlist without logging in.<p>edit: Another problem: since you are getting the music from remote sources, they can stick in HTTP authentication headers. I got hit with a few of those. Not sure if there is a practical technical solution to this though.<p>The auto source-finding works way better than songza's trial-and-error approach.",1216600004

251794,comment,251141,251779,0,0,adrianwaj,,,"I hear you loud and clear. Look from a systemic viewpoint.<p>Texts in the hands of people can have a great power at influencing the behaviour of their readers. When the author and readers are strongly prone to certain thoughts and actions as a result of a particular book, then short of education, banning a text may be an effective thing to do to avert a particular reality from occurring that a text may propose.<p>The fact that books are inanimate objects makes censorship possible in this way, rather than putting someone in prison. Sometimes people lose their freewill and are drawn to books... and meglomaniacs.",1216599430

The auto complete works very well(except just for artists, eh, not for song titles?).<p>It's a lot like Songza, except I like yours better. The white background is much superior to red, also your fonts are easier to read.<p>It also works very fast and have had good luck with finding good songs.<p>I like the ability to create playlists.<p>Occasionally the search would slow down on me.<p>Great job.<p>EDIT: Oh wow, just figured out you can save playlists.

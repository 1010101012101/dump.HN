I haven't done a boot camp so I don't know what they cover but there is quite a lot to computer science. Yes you may be able to program and do some software jobs but you would probably be constraining yourself to a small set of jobs.<p>Take a look at these for an idea of depth of software development:

The current tax on someone making $400K from a job is ~37% with federal/state/local. So you're reducing their tax burden more than half (if they spend 100% of what they make). In fact, they spend much less than they save, so if they buy $50K of stuff a year, their taxes are nearly eliminated ($8K in taxes versus $400K income). You can't provide the lower income people enough relief without adding to the debt (or raising the sales tax to something absurd, in which case low income people would need weekly credits or something).<p>This idea is insane.",1365022455

It was created to be an alternative to code generation, which is generally a pain for Java development. Swift generates bytecode at runtime, so you get all the performance advantages of code generation with none of the development disadvantages.<p>The idea with Swift is that you own the annotated classes and can fully customize them to your liking, independent of the IDL and wire format. For example, you can name the methods whatever you want, add documentation, helper methods, etc. When implementing a client for Thrift service, you only need the methods that you actually call.<p>You can use swift-generator-cli to generate the initial versions of the classes from existing Thrift IDL, which you then customize and maintain yourself. Alternatively, you can use swift-maven-plugin, which is pure Java (no external C++ binary), to generate code at compile time.<p>This project is in active development and use at Facebook, so please give it a try and let us know what you think!",1365022350

5488985,comment,5487678,5487678,1,0,jlees,,,"Very useful post. It's great to see these kinds of processes documented, might be nice to see some funnel metrics too - talking to some folks that also do (or need) small business customer acquisition, it seems there are a lot of sticky points in that process. My personal experience with small businesses is fairly hands-off, and from a large company, so it's nice to see the other side.<p>Couple of thoughts:<p>I'd expect that having successful vendor directories under your belt makes it more likely that someone will sign up, because you seem way more legitimate. Perhaps there are some stats from the most successful site you could use in the sales technique, e.g. ""Our most successful invitation vendors see over 10 new customer leads a day from our site"". (Or perhaps that's something for later on in the process, if a customer isn't convinced.)<p>Love the human aspect, the number of emails I (still) get at my old company address from people who clearly have no idea what the company does or what I would be interested in... It's pretty astounding.<p>I'm torn on the ""I'll create your profile for you"". I've had a few spammy emails where they effectively said ""You've been listed in $directory! Here's your listing! Now pay us so you can do stuff with it"". Urgh. Red flags. I wonder if there's some intermediate step that works even better, like ""I can create a profile for you, here's the information I have about you"" - a little more personalisation.<p>It also just occurred to me that to really get inside the customer's head for something like this, you could set up a vendor site yourself and see what kinds of emails come in :) Probably more useful if this customer acquisition process is going very badly, than immediately at the start.",1365022274

If you work half as much, then maybe it will have less features, but a good product should still be viable. And everyone knows predicting how your software will adhere to a schedule is impossible, so the chances are good you wouldn't even get it to work at 60 hrs/wk.<p>Obviously, an order of magnitude difference in effort should produce a qualitative difference in your product.

Fortunately the PDFs were generated as a report by a VB6 application (!) so they had a fairly regular format once I figured out the quirks of PDF, as the authors describe here.<p>I did learn a few neat tricks by doing it myself though. The library I used to extract the text was none other than Mozilla's own PDF.js, so in the final version my users could just drag and drop the PDF onto the browser window, and my little algorithm parsed the tables into arrays, with AngularJS rendering them as HTML tables.<p>Obviously computer-vision assisted, general purpose reconstruction of tabular data is the secret sauce in this project, but if you have the right use case you can do some cool things in the client. You do have to dig into the PDF.js internals a bit to figure out how to use it but I'm sure that it will improve in that respect.",1365021448

There were just under 1000 NES games for both the US AND Japanese market (combined), and the total clocks in at about 200MB in size. The 30+ games you saw were probably the entire library of <i>unique</i> games for the platform.<p>The games we had yesteryear sucked. Really, really sucked. Most of them were bare derivatives of each other. For every Super Mario Bros. 3 there were 5 clones of Arkanoid. The controls were bad, the artwork was bad, the framerates were bad. We just didn't know they sucked because we didn't have better games yet. Look at some of the best games on the market back then, games like Megaman or Star Fox, and they are are only popular as nostalgia pieces today. I don't consider Golgo 13 or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for the NES; PilotWings or DOOM on the SNES; Driver or Grand Theft Auto 3 on the PlayStation; to be anything close to playable games today, but I remember playing all of them for hours and liking it, because that was really all we knew.<p>And the games were not cheap. The NES retailed at $300 in the US when it debuted in 1985. That'd be almost $650 today. Super Mario Bros. 3 (the pinnacle of the series, IMO) debuted in 1990 at a price point of $60--over $105 in today's dollars. Chrono Trigger on the SNES debuted at $80 in 1995--over $120 today. I remember paying $70 for Yoshi's Cookie in 1992 (because I was 10 and that was all the Christmas money I had and I really, really wanted. My mother and I played it together for hours. It was great). That'd be $115 today for a puzzle game I could rewrite in a weekend now. I don't know what you're talking about with ""$5 games"".<p>You're praise of Sega Channel just further underscores that you were probably too young to understand money back in this time. It was $15/mo in 1994 when the only subscription services anyone had were telephone and TV cable (and you were ""rich"" if you had cable). I remember my father freaking out over a $20 telephone bill one month in the 90s: I regularly pay almost $100/mo for my cellphone today.

Choose based on the combination of CPU, RAM and disk I/O required.<p>* Only scales down to 40 dollars a month. --> t1.micro instances are $15/month.  m1.small instances are $40/month or as low as $25/month with reserved instances (amortized over 1 year) or even less than $25/month with spot instances.<p>* If you reboot it, the data will disappear. --> No. Data is not lost on reboot.  Most instances have two types of storage: EBS and Instance Store. The Instance Store data is lost when instances are powered off. EBS and Instance Store data survives across reboots. Understanding the difference between a rebot and a power-off is important.<p>* Firewall is turned on by default so you can't connect to it.

No. The DNS name, external IP and internal AWS IP are preserved across reboots. They are lost when an instance is powered off. (See above.)<p>* Use the IPs which amazon gives away for free. --> AWS limits you to 5 Elastic IP addresses (for the most part). You can (for the most part) avoid using Elastic IPs by using the public DNS of the instances, often in conjunction with your own domain DNS. For example, a database server might resolve like so:<p><pre><code>    db1.example.com (your domain)
    |-> ec2-12-34-56-789.compute-1.amazonaws.com (public AWS DNS)
        |-> 12.34.56.789 (public IP if you are outside of AWS)
        |-> 10.11.12.13 (internal AWS IP if you are inside AWS)

I found that funny as I don't count my productivity in hours work, but in the amount of ""product"" I produce.  ""Working hard"" shouldn't be a function of time, and I think more people need to appreciate that. 
This tends to be a little more difficult for people to do however, as it typically requires a lot of hard work up front. For example, it took me a month to figure out how I could make a 45 minute procedure turn into a 7 minute procedure while still maintaining the same quality. But I got it working and I can do 6 times the amount of work in the same amount of time.My free time  can now be spent doing other things, such as working on a startup:)

You can't imprison a corporation, true, but you can do a lot of other things to enforce laws: you can pierce the corporate veil, you can revoke licenses, and you can imprison executives. Choosing not to take those steps, or creating a system where taking those steps is possible, seems to be the real failure here.",1365019667

Here's why:<p>Once you reach a certain station in life, it's possible to sit back and think about being more effective while not working long hours. In fact, it's probably a great idea since it's easy to get addicted to working 7 days a week with very little sleep and that can wreak havoc on your health, relationships and happiness.<p>However, barring luck, people don't generally get to that station in life without working those long hours. If you want to be really good at something, it generally requires extreme dedication (yes, I know some people are just naturally talented, but I'm not talking about them). Unless you are one of those lucky ones, you _should_ be working really hard to master whatever it is that you need to master. Ignore people who are already successful trying to tell you to take it easy.<p>Also, unlike what Kyle says, people are not always working those crazy schedules to out hustle their competition. Often it's just passion and addiction to their own work and the desire to create something good (competition be damned)",1365019633

It's a tool, but static checks are better for things that can be statically checked. But I think you hinted at being in line with that, and yes you should still write tests.<p>But it's not right to think of Rust as a safe C++ in the small, particularly because of the ban on shared mutable state. IIRC, Rust is partly a product of the difficulty C++ had in this area.<p>I don't think they're rewriting Gecko. If the transitive property holds, the code in Servo is at least as different from the code in Gecko as Rust is from C++, and I think that's only amplified in the design. Servo aims to do things that are not realistic for Gecko, like parallelizing more of its operations. I don't think they'd be going this far with Servo at this point if it wasn't for that, I think Gecko would just see the necessary changes and that would be it.<p>Either way, Servo exists. We're told it started as research, but it is obviously at the point where its promise is more concrete. When the lessons have been learned from Servo, it will be a complete, embeddable (this is one goal Gecko gave up on) engine. There's no sense in backporting its innards to the C++ engine when you can just drop it in place.",1365019469

369498,comment,369495,369495,0,0,JesseAldridge,,,"""Breaking the petaflop barrier, a feat that seemed astronomical just two years ago, won't just allow faster computations. These computers will enable entirely new types of science that couldn't have been done before. This new generation of petascale machines will move scientific simulation beyond just supporting the two main branches of science, theory and experimentation, and into the foreground. Instead of just hypotheses being tested with experiments and observations, large-scale extrapolation and prediction of things we can't observe or that would be impractical for an experiment, will become central to many scientific endeavors.<p>'It's getting to the point where simulation is actually the third branch of science,' Seager said. 'We say that nature is always the arbiter of truth, but it turns out our ability to observe nature is fundamentally limited.'""",1227106299

I think the biggest stick to measure whether or not an endeavor creates value is looking how much people are willing to pay for it, and quite obviously Trism created a lot of value.<p>Further, I think that change is best effectuated through being rich. Money makes the world go round, and it's a hell of a lot more effective than just prancing around thinking about ways to make the world a better place out of college. Think about if Bill Gates devoted the first half of his life to just changing the world, he would have done a lot of good, but probably nothing that $50+ Billion can't overcompensate.",1227105223

Colleges, understandably, don't trust grades from no-name high schools, and anyone who doesn't realize that the extracurricular/""holistic"" aspect of the process is thinly-veiled socioeconomic selection (in favor of the rich, plus a few token poor, the latter being usually mountain-state whites) is not paying attention.",1227104546

Conventional wisdom says that once a dendritic cell is activated, it migrates to the lymph nodes to alert the immune system. Sometimes, it might have to travel from the tip of one's finger to the armpit - a long and perilous journey that could result in failure. But if a dendritic cell first recruits other sentinels, and all of them march towards the lymph nodes simultaneously, there is much less chance of the message being lost. ""It allows you to amplify the response,"" says Watkins. ""That's all hypothesis really. We have to prove it.""",1227103677
